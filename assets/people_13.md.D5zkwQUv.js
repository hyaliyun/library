Each circle represents a website, and each arrow represents a pair of hyperlinks between two websites. On the World Wide Web, a link farm is any group of websites that all hyperlink to other sites in the group for the purpose of increasing SEO rankings. In graph theoretic terms, a link farm is a clique. Although some link farms can be created by hand, most are created through automated programs and services. A link farm is a form of spamming the index of a web search engine (sometimes called spamdexing). Other link exchange systems are designed to allow individual websites to selectively exchange links with other relevant websites and are not considered a form of spamdexing. Search engines require ways to confirm page relevancy. A known method is to examine for one-way links coming directly from relevant websites. The process of building links should not be confused with being listed on link farms, as the latter requires reciprocal return links, which often renders the overall backlink advantage useless. This is due to oscillation, causing confusion over which is the vendor site and which is the promoting site. History Link farms were first developed by search engine optimizers (SEOs) in 1999 to take advantage of the Inktomi search engine's dependence upon link popularity. Although link popularity is used by some search engines to help establish a ranking order for search results, the Inktomi engine at the time maintained two indexes. Search results were produced from the primary index which was limited to approximately 100 million listings. Pages with few inbound links fell out of the Inktomi index on a monthly basis. Inktomi was targeted for manipulation through link farms because it was then used by several independent but popular search engines. Yahoo!, then the most popular search service, also used Inktomi results to supplement its directory search feature. The link farms helped stabilize listings primarily for online business Web sites that had few natural links from larger, more stable sites in the Inktomi index. Link farm exchanges were at first handled on an informal basis, but several service companies were founded to provide automated registration, categorization, and link page updates to member Web sites. When the Google search engine became popular, search engine optimizers learned that Google's ranking algorithm depended in part on a link-weighting scheme called PageRank. Rather than simply count all inbound links equally, the PageRank algorithm determines that some links may be more valuable than others, and therefore assigns them more weight than others. Link farming was adapted to help increase the PageRank of member pages. However, the link farms became susceptible to manipulation by unscrupulous webmasters who joined the services, received inbound linkage, and then found ways to hide their outbound links or to avoid posting any links on their sites at all. Link farm managers had to implement quality controls and monitor member compliance with their rules to ensure fairness. Alternative link farm products emerged, particularly link-finding software that identified potential reciprocal link partners, sent them template-based emails offering to exchange links, and created directory- like link pages for Web sites, in the hope of building their link popularity and PageRank. These link farms are sometimes considered a black-hat SEO strategy. Search engines countered the link farm movement by identifying specific attributes associated with link farm pages and filtering those pages from indexing and search results. In some cases, entire domains were removed from the search engine indexes in order to prevent them from influencing search results. Blog network A private blog network (PBN), also known as a link farm, is a group of blogs that are owned by the same entity. A blog network can either be a group of loosely connected blogs, or a group of blogs that are owned by the same company. The purpose of such a network is usually to promote the other blogs in the same network and therefore increase the search engine rankings or advertising revenue generated from online advertising on the blogs. In September 2014, Google targeted private blog networks (PBNs) with manual action ranking penalties. This served to dissuade search engine optimization and online marketers from using PBNs to increase their online rankings. The \\"thin content\\" warnings are closely tied to Panda which focuses on thin content and on-page quality. PBNs have a history of being targeted by Google and therefore may not be the safest option. Since Google is on the search for blog networks, they are not always linked together. In fact, interlinking your blogs could help Google and a single exposed blog could reveal the whole blog network by looking at the outbound links. A blog network may also refer to a central website, such as WordPress, where a user creates an account and is then able to use their own blog. The created blog forms part of a network because it uses either a subdomain or a subfolder of the main domain, although in all other ways it can be entirely autonomous. This is also known as a hosted blog platform and usually uses the free WordPress Multisite software. Hosted blog networks are also known as Web 2.0 networks, since they became more popular with the rise of the second phase of web development.

Software components GPE on a Sharp Zaurus C1000 GPE does not have any of the GNOME Core Applications, but instead software was written from scratch, tailored to the embedded environment. GPE is based on GTK+, and because GTK+ did not gain support for Wayland until versions 3.10, GPE uses X11 as its windowing system, e.g. with the combination X.Org Server/Matchbox. The project provides an infrastructure for easy and powerful application development by providing core software such as shared libraries, database schemata, and building on available technology including SQLite, D-BUS, GStreamer and several of the more common standards defined by freedesktop.org. One of the major goals of the GPE project is to encourage people to work on free software for mobile devices and to experiment with writing a GUI for embedded devices. Some of the applications already developed for GPE include: * GPE-Contacts - A contacts manager * GPE-Calendar - The calendar application * GPE-Edit - A simple text editor * GPE-Filemanager - A file manager with MIME type and remote access support * GPE-Gallery - Small and easy to use image viewer * GPE-Games - A small collection of tiny games * GPE-Mini-Browser - A CSS and JavaScript compatible compact web browser * GPE-Sketchbook - Create notes and sketches * GPE-Soundbite - A voice memo tool * GPE-ToDo - A task list manager * GPE-Timesheet - Track time spend on tasks * Starling - A GStreamer based audio player GPE's PIM applications (GPE- Contacts, GPE-Calendar, GPE-ToDo) can be synchronized with their desktop and web counterparts (such as Novell Evolution, Mozilla Sunbird and Google Calendar) through the use of GPE-Syncd and the OpenSync framework. GPE also contains a number of GUI utilities for configuring 802.11 Wireless LAN, Bluetooth, IrDA, Firewall, ALSA, Package Management, among others. A mobile push e-mail client based on the Tinymail framework is in development. Linux distributions Wikipedia viewed with the GPE Mini-Browser GPE can be found as a primary environment in the following embedded Linux distributions: * OpenEmbedded (ex OpenZaurus) * Ångström * Familiar Linux Though it may not be as highly supported as the distributions listed above, GPE is also available through package management utilities in the following distributions: * Ubuntu * Debian * Internet Tablet OS Controversy There are ongoing controversies surrounding the GPE project regarding a change of hosting service, ownership of an IRC channel, and a trademark dispute. =Web hosting= Serious issues first began developing over a proposed change of hosting service. GPE had been hosted at Handhelds.org since April 2002. Some of GPE's developers suggested, and later followed through with, a move to Linuxtogo.org by October 2006. Handhelds.org responded by removing the user accounts of the departing developers, and any links or reference to the new GPE Linuxtogo.org location on the original GPE Handhelds.org site. =IRC channel= Both parties claim ownership of the #gpe IRC channel located on freenode. Freenode has placed the channel in trust, or locked, until both sides can come to an agreement. Subsequently, Linuxtogo.org currently uses #gpe-project, and Handhelds.org uses #handhelds-gpe, both on Freenode.net. =Trademark= George France, has filed for trademark registration with the USPTO for GPE, in addition to OPIE and Ipkg as of March 6, 2007. On June 25, 2007, the USPTO declined to accept a screenshot of the Handhelds.org GPE website as proof of Handhelds.org's ownership, and in addition requested a better specimen for a “GPE product”. Handhelds.org, and OSI board member Russ Nelson, assert that the GPE project was given over to Handhelds.org for public development. The GPE developers working at Linuxtogo.org maintain that they represent the active GPE project, and Handhelds.org was only a hosting provider. Furthermore, they point out that the GPE project existed before it was hosted on Handhelds.org. The USPTO issued a final rejection regarding the GPE trademark on February 27, 2008. George France amended the application (removing references to GNU and Linux). The GPE trademark was officially published for opposition June 3, 2008. Despite George France's impending personal GPE trademark, the core GPE development team at Linuxtogo.org has abandoned much of the Handhelds.org GPE infrastructure. Linuxtogo.org developers have switched GPE to a new bootloader and replaced IPKG with OPKG, and made major changes to the GPE gui applications. The Trademark of GPE was registered to George France on Aug 19, 2008 by the USPTO.

She was the Scottish National Party (SNP) Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Govan from 1973 to 1974 and was Deputy Leader of the Scottish National Party from 1974 to 1979. She later served as an SNP and then Independent Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Lothian from 1999 until her death. Background Margo Symington Aitken was born in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, and grew up in and around East Kilbride, one of three siblings.Obituary for Margo MacDonald, telegraph.co.uk; accessed 5 April 2014. Her mother, Jean, was a nurse, and her father, Robert, was described as a \\"very cruel\\" man from whom her mother separated when Margo was 12 years old. She was educated at Hamilton Academy, and trained as a teacher of physical education at Dunfermline College of Physical Education immediately after leaving school. Family She married her first husband, Peter MacDonald, in 1965, and they ran a Blantyre pub, the Barnhill Tavern (known locally as The Hoolet's Nest), together. The MacDonalds had two daughters, Petra and Zoe, before the marriage ended in divorce. Her second marriage was to politician and columnist Jim Sillars, whom she married in 1981. Sillars went on to win the 1988 Glasgow Govan by-election for the SNP. Petra MacDonald married Craig Reid of the Proclaimers; the Reids have four children. Parliamentary career A committed and vocal supporter of Scottish independence, MacDonald entered parliamentary politics by winning the 1973 Glasgow Govan by-election as an SNP candidate at 30 years old. There were \\"scenes of near-hysteria by supporters\\" as she was declared the winner in what had, until then, been a Labour stronghold. Her election, during the last months of the Conservative Heath government, \\"overturned the theory that the SNP can thrive only [...] when a Labour Government is in office\\". She has alleged that her election to the House of Commons was followed by KGB and CIA agents taking her for lunch while posing as journalists, and believed the SNP was infiltrated during the 1970s by MI5 agents worried booming North Sea oil revenues could lead to independence. She failed to retain her seat in the following general election of February 1974, but became Deputy Leader of the SNP that year. At a December 1974 National Council meeting, Margo criticised the SNP for failing to win seats from Labour in industrial Scotland and urged the party to move to the left to compete. She had already been selected as the SNP candidate in Hamilton when the death of the MP led to the 1978 Hamilton by-election, which she lost. At the 1979 general election she was an unsuccessful candidate in Glasgow Shettleston. A staunch left-winger, she was one of three prominent spokespersons for the socialist 79 Group, which ultimately resulted in her failure to be re-elected as Deputy Leader at the party's 1979 conference. In 1982, Margo resigned from the SNP in protest of the 79 Group's proscription. She began to establish herself as a forceful and respected presenter of various radio and television programmes, including the short-lived Colour Supplement for Radio 4 in the mid-1980s. She contributed regularly to Scottish newspapers including the Edinburgh Evening News near the end of her life. By the mid-1990s, she had returned to the SNP and in 1999 she was elected to the Scottish Parliament, representing the Lothians. She earned a high media profile by her outspoken views on a number of issues, including sex workers' rights and MSPs' salaries. She quickly established herself as a rebel within the party, and was disciplined in 2000 for missing a parliamentary vote without permission and briefing a Sunday newspaper against party policy. Meanwhile, she lost influence with the party leadership, firstly under Alex Salmond and then John Swinney, for being in the SNP Fundamentalist mould and having supported Alex Neil in the party leadership election in 2000. She placed fifth on the SNP list for Lothians for the 2003 Parliament election, effectively ending her chances of being re-elected as an SNP MSP. In response, there were a spate of resignations from the party, and MacDonald decided to stand as an independent. For this, she was officially expelled from the SNP on 28 January 2003. Her diagnosis with Parkinson's disease became public knowledge at this time, ostensibly in an effort to diminish her electoral prospects. MacDonald, who had known about the diagnosis for six years, said it had been leaked to the press by \\"forces of darkness\\", but a spokesperson for the SNP insisted that the leak did not come from within the party. She was re-elected as an independent MSP at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, and again in 2007 and 2011. After her 2007 re-election MacDonald stood to become Presiding Officer, but lost the ballot to Alex Fergusson. During her time in parliament as an independent politician, she championed controversial causes, including the legalisation of assisted suicide. In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, MacDonald asked the UK's Security Service for assurances they would not interfere in the referendum process, suggesting that the security services \\"have people in the SNP\\". Death MacDonald died at her home in Edinburgh on 4 April 2014, aged 70.Obituary, independent.co.uk; accessed 5 April 2014. As she was elected as an independent regional MSP, according to the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998, her seat was left vacant until the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. Shortly after her death, it was confirmed that political leaders would pay tribute to her at a special session of the parliament. My Right to Die In July 2008, MacDonald co-operated with BBC Scotland in the making of a documentary about assisted dying. As a Parkinson's sufferer, MacDonald had long been a campaigner for assisted dying, saying that > \\"As someone with a degenerative condition – Parkinson's – this debate is not > a theory with me. The possibility of having the worst form of the disease at > the end of life has made me think about unpleasant things. I feel strongly > that, in the event of losing my dignity or being faced with the prospect of > a painful or protracted death, I should have the right to choose to curtail > my own, and my family's, suffering.\\" In the programme, MacDonald travelled around Scotland and met fellow sufferers and investigated the pros and cons of assisted dying, later stating that > \\"Online, euthanasia campaigners show viewers how to make an 'exit hood' to > end your life, and I know people with terminal illnesses now make the awful > trip to Mexico to buy lethal doses of drugs to take their own lives, all > because of our current laws. I am in no doubt that our legal system must > change.\\" See also *List of United Kingdom MPs with the shortest service References External links *Margo MacDonald profile, Scottish Parliament webpage * =Obituaries= * Scottish politician Margo MacDonald dies of Parkinson's; The Guardian * Reaction to the death of Margo MacDonald; The Daily Record Category:1943 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Deaths from Parkinson's disease Category:Disease-related deaths in Scotland Category:Euthanasia in the United Kingdom Category:Independent MSPs Category:Members of the Scottish Parliament 1999–2003 Category:Members of the Scottish Parliament 2003–2007 Category:Members of the Scottish Parliament 2007–2011 Category:Members of the Scottish Parliament 2011–2016 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Glasgow constituencies Category:People educated at Hamilton Academy Category:Politicians from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire Category:British politicians with physical disabilities Category:Scottish columnists Category:Scottish journalists Category:Scottish National Party MPs Category:Scottish National Party MSPs Category:Scottish republicans Category:Scottish schoolteachers Category:Scottish television presenters Category:UK MPs 1970–1974 Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies Category:Female members of the Scottish Parliament Category:20th-century British women politicians Category:21st-century British women politicians Category:Women columnists ","title":"Margo MacDonald"},{"id":"270262","text":"Anthony George Banks (born 27 March 1950) is an English musician, songwriter and film composer primarily known as the keyboardist and founding member of the rock band Genesis. Banks is also a prolific solo artist, releasing six solo albums that range through progressive rock, pop, and classical music. Banks co-formed Genesis in 1967 while studying at Charterhouse as their keyboardist and one of their principal songwriters and lyricists. He became a prolific user of the Hammond T-102 organ, Mellotron, ARP Pro Soloist and Yamaha CP-70 piano. In the band's earliest years Banks would play acoustic guitar for some of the mellow and pastoral songs. In 2010, Banks was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis. In 2015, he was named \\"Prog God\\" at the Progressive Music Awards. Banks is ranked No. 11 on MusicRadar's greatest keyboard players of all time. Early life Anthony George Banks was born on 27 March 1950 in East Hoathly with Halland, East Sussex as the youngest of five children. He cites his mother, a pianist, as being particularly into music, and first listened to classical music albums that she owned from around six before he moved to musical theatre compositions by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Banks's elder brother introduced him to a wider variety, naming \\"Sixteen Tons\\" sung by Frankie Laine as one of the songs, and said, \\"By 1961, and for the next five to six years, I was music mad!\\" Banks started piano lessons at school at eight with the headmaster's wife, but did not enjoy tuition at first because he was \\"quite forced into it\\" by his parents until he grew to enjoy it. He considered himself an average piano player, and learned to recite pieces by Sergei Rachmaninoff and Maurice Ravel, his two favourite piano composers, by ear. At 13, he began lessons with an unsuitable teacher who made him lose interest in classical music, but he then started to recite songs by ear that he heard on the radio. Months later, he acquired a new piano teacher who sparked his interest in classical compositions once more, which became a deciding factor for Banks's decision to pursue a career in music. In addition to the piano, Banks taught himself to play the guitar. At seven, Banks began six years of study at Boarzell Preparatory School, a boarding school in Hurst Green. In September 1963, Banks began study at Charterhouse School, a private school in Godalming, Surrey. He studied classical piano as an extracurricular subject. Shortly after his arrival he befriended fellow pupil and future Genesis bandmate Peter Gabriel, initially over their general distaste for the school's environment. They went on to play in Garden Wall, a school band with drummer Chris Stewart. In early 1967, they merged with guitarists Mike Rutherford and Anthony Phillips, two members of Anon, another school band, to record a series of demos which led to the formation of their new band Genesis. Banks originally planned to study mathematics in higher education. After leaving Charterhouse, Banks began studying chemistry at Sussex University but soon switched to physics and philosophy. After a year at Sussex, he took a leave of absence in 1969 to explore a career with Genesis since the group had split but decided to reform and become a full-time professional band. Banks never returned to the university.Gallo Career =1967–2007: Genesis= Banks performing with Genesis in 2007 Banks's elaborate arrangements and keyboard solos – such as the piano introduction to \\"Firth of Fifth\\" and the instrumental sections of \\"The Cinema Show\\", \\"Watcher of the Skies\\", and \\"Supper's Ready\\" – helped to establish Genesis's sound. In addition to playing keyboards, Banks contributed (along with Anthony Phillips, Steve Hackett and Rutherford) to Genesis's 12-string acoustic passages in songs such as \\"The Musical Box\\", \\"Entangled\\", \\"The Cinema Show\\", and the beginning part of \\"Supper's Ready\\". Banks also was an occasional back-up vocalist and sang co-lead vocals on \\"Shepherd\\", an unreleased track from 1970 which finally surfaced on the Genesis Archive 1967–75 boxed set. Notable Banks-penned Genesis songs (post Peter Gabriel) include \\"Mad Man Moon\\", \\"One for the Vine\\" and the anthemic ballad \\"Afterglow\\", which remained a popular coda to the Banks-driven medleys that the group played during live shows for years. In 1997, Banks turned down an invitation to play on Steve Hackett's solo album Genesis Revisited as he disliked going over past material and an appearance would have added confusion to the fact Genesis were close to putting out Calling All Stations. After Genesis split in 1998, Banks's career stagnated, and he considered retirement from music. It was during this time that he began composing, titling an early piece \\"Black Down\\" which led to his decision to pursue orchestra composition. =1978–present: Solo projects= Rock albums Banks first thought of making a solo album in 1975, following Gabriel's departure from Genesis. He had a group of songs in development at the time which were used on A Trick of the Tail (1976), their first album recorded without Gabriel, including \\"Mad Man Moon\\" and sections of \\"Entangled\\" and \\"Ripples\\". In 1979, after Genesis had entered a break in activity, Banks and Rutherford travelled to Polar Studios in Stockholm and recorded their first studio albums. Banks's album, A Curious Feeling, was released first in October of that year. It was originally meant to be based and titled after the short story Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes, and Banks had written a complete set of lyrics for the story, but shelved the idea after he was made aware of an upcoming musical about the book. In addition to keyboards Banks plays the guitar and bass as he wanted the album to be \\"As personal as possible\\". He enlisted Kim Beacon of String Driven Thing as vocalist. In June 1983, Banks released his second studio album, The Fugitive. It remains unique as his only album to feature himself as lead vocalist on all of the songs; a role he considered after recording guide vocals for Collins to sing for \\"Me and Sarah Jane\\" and \\"Keep It Dark\\" on the Genesis album Abacab (1981). Banks has employed guest vocalists on his solo albums; these have included Fish, Nik Kershaw, Toyah Willcox, Jack Hues and Jim Diamond. In 1988, Banks recorded a pop and rock-oriented album under a group identity named Bankstatement, featuring guitarist and co-producer Steve Hillage and singers Alistair Gordon and Jayney Klimek, plus additional musicians. Banks felt inspired to pursue the project having witnessed Rutherford enjoy the success of his own group, Mike + the Mechanics. Their same-titled release was released in 1989. Banks himself also took the lead vocal on one track (the track Big Man) Banks released his fourth studio album, Still, in April 1991. In contrast to his previous use of one or two vocalists on an album, he chose a greater number for Still as he saw little point in restricting himself and selected different people for tracks they suited best. As on the previous album, Banks took the lead vocal on one track (Hero For an Hour) Banks formed his second group project outside Genesis in 1994. He initially wanted to name the band Incognito, but found out there was another group with the name and chose Strictly Inc. It featured himself with Wang Chung vocalist Jack Hues, and their same-titled album saw a UK release in September 1995. In 2004, after recording his classical album Seven, Banks expressed an interest to record another rock solo album but said the environment is becoming increasingly difficult in terms of securing a deal, yet the likelihood of it solely being an independent or online release does appeal to him. He added: \\"I'm not trying to prove anything. I haven't got to convince anybody. I don't have to worry about reviews or anything like that. You are just doing it for people who are familiar with what you are doing\\". Film scores In 1978, Banks and Rutherford were asked by musician and producer Rupert Hine to write music for the horror film The Shout (1978), after David Bowie was originally booked but failed to attend sessions. Hine recommended Genesis, and organised recording in a church without Collins as he was unavailable at short notice. The main theme that they developed was later featured on \\"From the Undertow\\" on Banks's solo album A Curious Feeling. Banks's first major film score was for the 1983 loose remake The Wicked Lady (1983), for director Michael Winner. The soundtrack was released in April 1983 on Atlantic Records. Around 1983, Banks was asked by director Peter Hyams to score the soundtrack to 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984), the sequel to the popular science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), having liked his work for The Shout. However, the \\"masses\\" of music Banks had written was poorly received by Hyams which led to his departure from the project, leaving Banks disappointed. With months to spare, Banks accepted the job of scoring another science fiction film, Lorca and the Outlaws (1984), which came with no salary. Its low budget prevented Banks from using a professional studio, so he wrote the music using his own 16-track machine. Banks was also a contender to compose the music for The Terminator and was sent the script. His next soundtrack was the drama film Quicksilver (1986). Banks recalled the directors were more supportive towards him and the process went smoothly, but disliked their demand for more straightforward songs on the soundtrack in order to have a hit single that they could release. Among the tracks recorded was \\"Shortcut to Somewhere\\", a collaboration with Marillion singer Fish, which became the only single from Banks's solo career to chart in the UK when it reached number 75. Selections of music written for Lorca and the Outlaws and Quicksilver were later released on Banks's compilation album Soundtracks (1986). Classical albums Banks became interested in the music of Gustav Mahler after hearing it in Death in Venice. He also cites Dmitri Shostakovich and Erik Satie as composers whose music he has enjoyed. He identifies Symphony No. 4 in A minor and Symphony No. 7 in C major by Jean Sibelius, and Symphony No. 5 in D major by Ralph Vaughan Williams as favourite pieces. Critics have noted that Vaughan Williams and film composer John Barry are notable influences on his own orchestral compositions. Banks has acknowledged similarities in style between his orchestral works and those of Vaughan Williams, Sibelius and Barry. In March 2004, Banks released his fourth studio album, and first of entirely classical music, entitled Seven: A Suite for Orchestra on Naxos Records. He had the idea for the album around six years prior to starting working on it, and felt encouraged after hearing the orchestral arrangements of his compositions for the soundtrack to The Wicked Lady. It features seven compositions performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra with Banks on the piano for three tracks with conductor Mike Dixon. On 26 March 2012, Banks's second classical album was released (also on Naxos), entitled Six Pieces for Orchestra, performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Paul Englishby. Tracks are: \\"Siren\\" featuring Martin Robertson on alto saxophone, \\"Still Waters\\", \\"Blade\\" with Charlie Siem on violin, \\"Wild Pilgrimage\\", \\"The Oracle\\" and \\"City of Gold\\". Banks's third classical music album, Five, was released in February 2018. This work's origin was, as he related in the album's booklet, \\"(...) the writing in 2013 of a piece for following year's Cheltenhan Music Festival, as a great oportunity for me to have one of my orchestral pieces played live, which had not happen before (...)\\". It features five pieces performed by The Czech National Symphony Orchestra and Choir conducted by Nick Ingman, and Banks on piano and celeste. Other recent projects includes writing music for operatic tenor John Potter and to a Shakespeare sonnet. Reception Banks pioneered many unique keyboard and synthesizer sounds throughout his career; music historian Wayne Studer has referred to him as \\"the most tasteful keyboardist of prog rock.\\" One of his achievements was the technique of using the trigger output of a Linn LM-1 drum machine to have the hi-hat pattern trigger an ARP Quadra synthesizer, creating such parts as the pulsating drum sound in \\"Mama\\" (from 1983's Genesis) and \\"By You\\" on The Fugitive (1983). Another unique synth technique was used on the track \\"Who Dunnit?\\" from the 1981 album Abacab; a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 was programmed with a few sounds, and the patches were switched manually (via the panel preset tabs) while he played. Known for his lack of flamboyance on stage, Banks did wear a snorkel for performances of \\"Who Dunnit?\\" on the Abacab tour.  Instruments  Banks achieved a distinctive sound by running all of his keyboards (as well as his 12-string guitar) into a mixing board and then running the signal output of the board into a Leslie speaker (both the mixer and the rotary speaker were homemade). This can clearly be heard on everything Banks plays on the Genesis Live album. Banks's earliest setup included a Hammond L-100 organ, a Hohner Pianet N and a Mellotron MkII, all of which (as well as grand piano) are first heard on the Trespass album. Banks used the Pianet as both a substitute for a grand piano, and also as a lead instrument, with the use of a fuzz box (also homemade, similar to the Fender Blender). He would often duel with Hackett's guitar, as heard on tracks like \\"The Musical Box\\", \\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\\", and \\"Supper's Ready\\". Banks in 1974 switched from his Pianet to an RMI 368x Electra Piano and Harpsichord, which was soon integrated into the sound of Genesis, as first heard at various points on The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) album. It was often effected with the homemade fuzz box and an MXR Phase 100 – later these pedals were inserted in the panel of the Electra Piano. In 1978, the RMI was replaced with the Yamaha CP-70 electric grand piano. The first synthesizer used by Banks was the monophonic ARP Pro Soloist, which Banks first acquired in 1973 along with a Hammond T-102 and a Mellotron M400 for the Selling England by the Pound album, replacing the Hammond L122 and the Mellotron MkII. With the release of the Trick of the Tail album in 1976 and onward, Banks made use of the ARP 2600, a semi-modular synthesizer, in the studio as well as live on stage. On 1978's ...And Then There Were Three... the Polymoog (one of the first polyphonic synthesizers) was integrated into Banks' expansive array, which enabled more expressive and highly layered \\"colorful\\" textures along with his unique use of MXR Phase 100 and Boss CE-1 Chorus effects pedals on the Hammond T-102 organ. During this time, he also added a Roland RS-202 string and brass synthesizer to mainly replace the Mellotron, though not used live. He also briefly used a Fender Rhodes electric piano. He also acquired a Yamaha CP-70 electric grand piano, which, when put through a Boss chorus, would become a signature part of Banks' 1970's - 80's sound. He used this technique all the way up to Duke in 1980, when he made a major overhaul of his rig, dropping the ARP 2600, the ARP Pro- Soloist, the Mellotron and the RS-202 in favour of a Yamaha CS-80, a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, an ARP Quadra and a Roland VP-330. On Abacab in 1981, the organ was no longer featured; organ sounds were emulated using a Sequential Circuits Prophet 10 synthesizer through the Boss CE-1. For the album Genesis in 1983, he replaced the Polymoog with an E-mu Emulator digital sampler. He also added a NED Synclavier II, which also has had prominent features in Banks' career, such as on \\"Home by the Sea\\". His final changes in this rig were replacing the E-mu Emulator with an E-mu Emulator II+ and the Roland VP-330 with a Yamaha DX7 for Invisible Touch. Since the We Can't Dance (1991) album, Banks has favoured Roland and Korg synthesizers, such as Roland JD-800 and Korg Wavestation. Evolving technology and sampling has allowed him to use a smaller rig of 4 or 3 keyboards with an array of rack mounted synth modules to emulate many of the earlier sounds. His concert rigs since When in Rome 2007 include Korg Wavestation and Roland A-90 keyboard acting as MIDI controllers for rack mounted Korg Wavestation SR, Roland JD-990, Yamaha TX7, E-mu Proteus I and II, and E-mu EIV, as well as Korg OASYS as a master keyboard.  Personal life  Banks married Margaret McBain on 29 July 1972. They had a one-day honeymoon as Banks was too busy with finishing the Genesis album Foxtrot. Banks said: \\"The band felt sorry for me so they paid for her to come on the next tour\\". The couple have two children, Benjamin (b. 1978) and Emily (b. 1981), and live near Godalming, Surrey.

Properties Tetrazene has been reported to have eleven isomers. The most stable of these is the straight-chain 2-tetrazene (NH2-N=N-NH2), having a standard heat of formation at 301.3 kJ/mol. The eleven isomers can be arranged into three groups: straight-chain tetrazenes, four- membered cyclotetrazane, and three-membered cyclotriazanes. Each straight- chain tetrazene isomer possesses one N=N double bond and two N-N single bonds. Tautomerizations do occur between the isomers.

Its mission is \\"to nurture the creative process by providing an opportunity for artists to work without interruption in a supportive environment.\\". On March 11, 2013 it was designated a National Historic Landmark. It offers residencies to artists working in choreography, film, literature, musical composition, painting, performance art, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and video. Collectively, artists who have worked at Yaddo have won 66 Pulitzer Prizes, 27 MacArthur Fellowships, 61 National Book Awards, 24 National Book Critics Circle Awards, 108 Rome Prizes, 49 Whiting Writers' Awards, a Nobel Prize (Saul Bellow, who won the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction and Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976), at least one Man Booker Prize (Alan Hollinghurst, 2004) and countless other honors. Yaddo is included in the Union Avenue Historic District. History The estate was purchased in 1881 by the financier Spencer Trask and his wife, the writer Katrina Trask. The first mansion on the property burned down in 1893, and the Trasks then built the current house. Yaddo is a neologism invented by one of the Trask children and was meant to rhyme with \\"shadow\\". =Artists' colony= In 1900, after the premature deaths of the Trasks' four children, Spencer Trask decided to turn the estate into an artists' retreat as a gift to his wife. He did this with the financial assistance of philanthropist George Foster Peabody. The first artists arrived in 1926. The success of Yaddo encouraged Spencer and Katrina later to donate land for a working women's retreat center as well, known as Wiawaka Holiday House, at the request of Mary Wiltsie Fuller.. At least in its early years, Yaddo was funded by profits from the Bowling Green Offices Building in Manhattan, in which Spencer Trask was extensively involved. In 1949 during the McCarthy Era, a news story accurately accused writer Agnes Smedley of spying for the Soviet Union.Ruth Price, The Lives of Agnes Smedley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), 5-9. Smedley had traveled with Mao Zedong to report on the Chinese Communist Revolution and, beginning in 1943, had spent five years at Yaddo. Poet Robert Lowell pushed the Board of Directors to oust Yaddo's director, Elizabeth Ames, who was being questioned by the FBI. Ames was eventually exonerated of all charges but learned from the investigation that her assistant Mary Townsend was an FBI informant... Ames remained director until her retirement in 1969, having overseen the Yaddo community from its creation in 1924.\\"Elizabeth Ames, Creator of Yaddo, Upstate Cultural Haven, Dies at 92,\\" New York Times, March 30, 1977. Ames was succeeded by Newman E. Waite who served as president from 1969 until 1977 when Curtis Harnack assumed the position.. Literary critic and eventual Yaddo board member Louis Kronenberger wrote in his memoir that to call Yaddo \\"a mixture of some of the most attractive, enjoyable, generous-minded people and of others who were weird, megalomaniac, intransigent, pugnacious is only to say that it has housed and nourished most of the finest talents in the arts of the past forty-odd years—the immensely fruitful years of Elizabeth Ames's directorship.\\"Louis Kronenberger, No Whippings, No Gold Watches (Boston: Little Brown, 1970), 269. = Recent years = In May 2005, vandals, using paintball guns, damaged two of the Four Seasons statues, the Poet's Bench, a fountain, and pathways with blue paint. Repairs cost $1,400. In 2018, Yaddo elected photographer Peter Kayafas and novelist Janice Y.K. Lee, as Co-Chairs of its Board of Directors. Yaddo has received large contributions from Spencer Trask & Company and Kevin Kimberlin, the firm's current chairman. Novelist Patricia Highsmith bequeathed her estate, valued at $3 million, to the community.  Facilities and gardens  Pergola in Yaddo's gardens, photographed c. 1900–20 Yaddo's gardens are modeled after the classical Italian gardens the Trasks had visited in Europe.Yaddo Gardens website. The Four Seasons statues were acquired and installed in the garden in 1909.\\"At Yaddo, statues truly are for all seasons,\\" Daily Gazette Schenectady, New York, January 21, 2017.

Oration 1, ΠΕΡΙ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΑΣ (On Kingship) Dio Chrysostom (; Dion Chrysostomos), Dion of Prusa or Dio Cocceianus (c. 40 – c. 115 AD), was a Greek orator, writer, philosopher and historian of the Roman Empire in the 1st century AD. Eighty of his Discourses (or Orations; ) are extant, as well as a few Letters and a funny mock essay \\"In Praise of Hair\\", as well as a few other fragments. His surname Chrysostom comes from the Greek chrysostomos (χρυσόστομος), which literally means \\"golden-mouthed\\". Life He was born at Prusa (now Bursa) in the Roman province of Bithynia (now part of northwestern Turkey). His father, Pasicrates, seems to have bestowed great care on his son Dio's education and the early training of his mind. At first he occupied himself in his native place, where he held important offices, with the composition of speeches and other rhetorical and sophistical essays, but he later devoted himself with great zeal to the study of philosophy. He did not, however, confine himself to any particular sect or school, nor did he give himself up to any profound speculations, his object being rather to apply the doctrines of philosophy to the purposes of practical life, and more especially to the administration of public affairs, and thus to bring about a better state of things. The Stoic and Platonist philosophies, however, appear to have had the greatest charms for him. He went to Rome during Vespasian's reign (69–79 AD), by which time he seems to have got married and had a child.Dio Chrysostom, Orat. xlvi. 13 He became a critic of the Emperor Domitian,Dio Chrysostom, Orat. iii. 13 who banished him from Rome, Italy, and Bithynia in 82 for advising one of the Emperor's conspiring relatives.Dio Chrysostom, Orat. xiii. 1 On the advice of the Delphic oracle,Dio Chrysostom, Orat. xiii. 9 he put on the clothes of a beggar,Dio Chrysostom, Orat. xiii. 11 and with nothing in his pocket but a copy of Plato's Phaedo and Demosthenes's oration on the Embassy, he lived the life of a Cynic philosopher, undertaking a journey to the countries in the north and east of the Roman empire. He thus visited Thrace, Mysia, Scythia, and the country of the Getae,Dio Chrysostom, Orat. xii. 16 and owing to the power and wisdom of his orations, he met everywhere with a kindly reception, and did much good.Dio Chrysostom, Orat. xxxvi.; comp. Orat. xiii. 11 ff. He was a friend of Nerva,Dio Chrysostom, Orat. xlv. 2 and when Domitian was murdered in 96 AD, Dio used his influence with the army stationed on the frontier in favour of Nerva. Under Emperor Nerva's reign, his exile was ended, and he was able to return home to Prusa. He adopted the surname Cocceianus in later life to honour the support given to him by the emperor,Pliny, Epistles, x. 81 whose full name was Marcus Cocceius Nerva. Nerva's successor, Trajan, entertained the highest esteem for Dio,Dio Chrysostom, Orat. iii. 2 and showed him the most marked favour. His kindly disposition gained him many eminent friends, such as Apollonius of Tyana and Euphrates of Tyre, and his oratory the admiration of all. In his later life Dio had considerable status in Prusa, and there are records of him being involved in an urban renewal lawsuit about 111. He probably died a few years later. Writings Dio Chrysostom was part of the Second Sophistic school of Greek philosophers which reached its peak in the early 2nd century. He was considered as one of the most eminent of the Greek rhetoricians and sophists by the ancients who wrote about him, such as Philostratus,Philostratus, Vitae sophistorum i.7 Synesius,Synesius, Dion and Photius.Photius, Bibl. Cod. 209 This is confirmed by the eighty orations of his which are still extant, and which were the only ones known in the time of Photius. These orations appear to be written versions of his oral teaching, and are like essays on political, moral, and philosophical subjects. They include four orations on Kingship addressed to Trajan on the virtues of a sovereign; four on the character of Diogenes of Sinope, on the troubles to which men expose themselves by deserting the path of Nature, and on the difficulties which a sovereign has to encounter; essays on slavery and freedom; on the means of attaining eminence as an orator; political discourses addressed to various towns which he sometimes praises and sometimes blames, but always with moderation and wisdom; on subjects of ethics and practical philosophy, which he treats in a popular and attractive manner; and lastly, orations on mythical subjects and show-speeches. He argued strongly against permitting prostitution.Dio Chrysostom, Orat. vii.133‑152 He also claimed that the epics of Homer had been translated and were sung in India;Dio Chrysostom, Orat. liii. 6-8 this is unlikely to be true, and there may have been confusion with the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, of which there are some parallels in subject matter.McEvilley, T., (2002), The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies, page 387. Allworth Communications. Two orations of his (37 and 64) are now assigned to Favorinus. Besides the eighty orations we have fragments of fifteen others, and there are extant also five letters under Dio's name. Dio believed that it was the Trojans that had won the Trojan War. Some modern researchers also agree with this. For example, A. Belyakov and O. Matveychev in their book also adhere to this point of view referring to a number of modern sources. He wrote many other philosophical and historical works, none of which survive. One of these works, Getica, was on the Getae, which the Suda incorrectly attributes to Dio Cassius.Suda, Dion Editions * Hans von Arnim, Dionis Prusaensis quem uocant Chrysostomum quae exstant omnia (Berlin, 1893–1896). * C.

Though awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for recordings featuring his piano performances, he was as famous for his mordant character and witticisms, on the radio and later in movies and television, as for his music. Early life Levant was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, in 1906, to Orthodox Jewish parents from Russia. His father, Max, was a watchmaker who wanted his four sons to become either dentists or doctors. His mother Annie was a highly religious woman whose father was a Rabbi who presided over his daughter's wedding to Max Levant. Oscar Levant moved to New York in 1922, following the death of his father. He began studying under Zygmunt Stojowski, a well-established piano pedagogue. In 1925, aged 18, he appeared with Ben Bernie in a short film, Ben Bernie and All the Lads, made in New York City in the De Forest Phonofilm sound-on-film system. Career In 1928, Levant traveled to Hollywood, where his career took a turn for the better. During his stay, he met and befriended George Gershwin. From 1929 to 1948 he composed the music for more than twenty movies. During this period, he also wrote or co-wrote numerous popular songs that made the Hit Parade, the most noteworthy being \\"Blame It on My Youth\\" (1934), now considered a standard. Around 1932, Levant began composing seriously. He studied under Arnold Schoenberg and impressed him sufficiently to be offered an assistantship (which he turned down, considering himself unqualified).Oscar Levant, The Unimportance of Being Oscar, Pocket Books 1969 (reprint of G.P. Putnam 1968), p. 113. . His formal studies led to a request by Aaron Copland to play at the Yaddo Festival of contemporary American music on April 30 of that year. Successful, Levant began composing a new orchestral work, a sinfonietta. The year 1938 saw Levant make his debut as a music conductor on Broadway, filling in for his brother Harry in sixty-five performances of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart’s The Fabulous Invalid. In 1939 he was again working on Broadway as composer and conductor of The American Way, another Kaufman and Hart production. At this time, Levant was becoming best known to American audiences as one of the regular panelists on the radio quiz show Information Please. Originally scheduled as a guest panelist, Levant proved so quick-witted and popular that he became a regular fixture on the show in the late 1930s and 1940s, along with fellow panelists Franklin P. Adams and John Kieran and moderator Clifton Fadiman. \\"Mr. Levant,\\" as he was always called, was often challenged with musical questions, and he impressed audiences with his depth of knowledge and facility with a joke. Kieran praised Levant as having a \\"positive genius for making offhand cutting remarks that couldn't have been sharper if he'd honed them a week in his mind. Oscar was always good for a bright response edged with acid.\\" Examples include \\"I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin,\\" \\"I think a lot of Bernstein—but not as much as he does,\\" and (after Marilyn converted to Judaism when she married playwright Arthur Miller), \\"Now that Marilyn Monroe is kosher, Arthur Miller can eat her.\\" From the 1930s through the mid-1950s, Levant appeared in a number of feature films, often playing a pianist or composer. He had major supporting roles in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals The Barkleys of Broadway (1949), starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, An American in Paris (1951), starring Gene Kelly, and The Band Wagon (1953), starring Astaire and Cyd Charisse. From 1947 to 1949, Levant regularly appeared on NBC radio's Kraft Music Hall, starring Al Jolson. He not only accompanied singer Jolson on the piano with classical and popular songs, but often joked and ad-libbed with Jolson and his guests. This included comedy sketches. The pairing of the two entertainers was inspired. Their individual ties to George Gershwin—Jolson introduced Gershwin's \\"Swanee\\"—undoubtedly had much to do with their rapport. Both Levant and Jolson appeared as themselves in the Gershwin biopic Rhapsody in Blue (1945). Levant in An American in Paris (1951) In the early 1950s, Levant was an occasional panelist on the NBC game show Who Said That?, in which celebrities would try to determine the speaker of quotations taken from recent news reports. Between 1958 and 1960, Levant hosted a television talk show on KCOP-TV in Los Angeles, The Oscar Levant Show, which later became syndicated. It featured his piano playing along with monologues and interviews with top-name guests such as Fred Astaire and Linus Pauling. Full recordings of only two shows are known to exist, one with Astaire, who paid to have a kinescope recording of the broadcast made so that he could assess his performance. In 1960, Levant was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in recognition of his recording career. Personal life Levant was briefly married to actress Barbara Woodell; they divorced in 1932. In 1939, Levant married his second wife, singer and actress June Gale (née Doris Gilmartin), one of the Gale Sisters. They were married for 33 years, until his death in 1972, and had three children: Marcia, Lorna, and Amanda. Levant talked openly on television about his neuroses and hypochondria. Evidently, he talked openly about them many years before his first television appearance. Writer and humorist Alexander Woollcott, a member of the Algonquin Round Table who died in 1943, said of him: \\"There isn't anything the matter with Levant that a few miracles wouldn't cure.\\"Teichman, Howard, Smark Aleck, the Wit World and Life of Alexander Woollcott (William Morrow and Company, Inc., 1976), p. 170 Despite his afflictions, Levant was considered a multifaceted genius by some. He himself wisecracked \\"There's a fine line between genius and insanity. I have erased this line.\\" In later life Levant became addicted to prescription drugs, was frequently committed to mental hospitals by his wife, and increasingly withdrew from the limelight. He was the inspiration for the neurotic, womanizing pianist \\"Henry Orient\\" in Nora Johnson's novel and subsequent Hollywood film The World of Henry Orient (1964). Death Crypt of Oscar Levant at Westwood Memorial Park A lifelong heavy smoker and longtime pharmaceutical drug user, Levant died in his house in Beverly Hills, California of a heart attack in 1972 at age 65. His death was discovered by his wife June when she called him from their bedroom to meet for an interview with Candice Bergen, a photojournalist at the time. According to Bergen’s memoir titled Knock Wood, she had visited the same Beverly Hills house on the previous day; Knock Wood includes one of her photographs from that occasion. In the book Bergen reveals that Levant asked her to return the next day to take more photographs, and she agreed. While she was driving with her camera in her car on the following day, she did not know he had died. Levant is interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. In citing an old joke, some comedians have told an apocryphal story about Levant: that his epitaph reads, \\"I told them I was ill.\\" His gravestone is actually a small plaque on a columbarium with his name, exact dates of birth / death and nothing else.

It is most common in individuals homozygous for a recessive allele on chromosome 16 that produces an altered version of the MC1R protein. Red hair varies in hue from a deep burgundy or bright copper, or auburn, to burnt orange or red-orange to strawberry blond. Characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin, it is associated with fair skin color, lighter eye color, freckles, and sensitivity to ultraviolet light. Cultural reactions to red hair have varied from ridicule to admiration with many common stereotypes in existence regarding redheads. The term redhead has been in use since at least 1510.  Geographic distribution  = Modern =  Northern and Western Europe  Red hair is most commonly found at the northern and western fringes of Europe; it is centred around populations in the British Isles and is particularly associated with the Celtic nations. Man with red hair and beard Ireland has the highest number of red-haired people per capita in the world with the percentage of those with red hair at around 10%. Great Britain also has a high percentage of people with red hair. In Scotland around 6% of the population has red hair; with the highest concentration of red head carriers in the world found in Edinburgh, making it the red head capital of the world. In 1907, the largest ever study of hair colour in Scotland, which analysed over 500,000 people, found the percentage of Scots with red hair to be 5.3%. A 1956 study of hair colour among British Army recruits also found high levels of red hair in Wales and in the Scottish border counties of England.  Eastern and Southern Europe  Roman fresco depicting Bacchus with red hair, Boscoreale, c. 30 BC In Italy, red hair is found at a frequency of 0.57% of the total population, without variation in frequency across the different regions of the country.Consanguinity, Inbreeding, and Genetic Drift in Italy, Princeton University Press, 15 Feb 2013, Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Antonio Moroni, Gianna Zei, page 270 In Sardinia, red hair is found at a frequency of 0.24% of the population. Victorian era ethnographers considered the Udmurt people of the Volga Region in Russia to be \\"the most red-headed men in the world\\". The Volga region still has one of the highest percentages of redheaded people. Red hair is also found amongst the Ashkenazi Jewish populations. In 1903, 5.6% of Polish Jews had red hair.Elkind. Evrei Trudi Antropologitshes-kavo Amdilla, xxi., Moscow, 1903 Other studies have found that 3.69% of Jewish women overall were found to have red hair, but around 10.9% of all Jewish men have red beards.Maurice Fishberg (1911).

In European culture, before the 20th century, red hair was often seen as a stereotypically Jewish trait: during the Spanish Inquisition, all those with red hair were identified as Jewish.The Jewish Persona in the European Imagination: A Case of Russian Literature, By Leonid Livak, (Stanford University Press 2010). In Italy, red hair was associated with Italian Jews, and Judas was traditionally depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art.Judas's Red Hair and The Jews, Journal of Jewish Art (9), 31–46, 1982, Melinnkoff R.M The stereotype that red hair is Jewish remains in parts of Eastern Europe and Russia.Jewish hearts: a study of dynamic ethnicity in the United States and the Soviet Union, SUNY Press, 2001, Betty N.

The Queen of Morocco, Lalla Salma wife of king Mohammed VI, has red hair. Abd ar-Rahman I, founding emir of Córdoba, also had red hair, his mother being a Christian Berber slave.  Asia (all regions)  Mustafa Amini, Australian footballer of Afghan descent Uyghur girl in Kashgar, China's Xinjiang region, with auburn hair In Asia, red hair can be found among some peoples of Arab, Iranian, Mongolian, Turkic, Miao and Hmong descent. Ancient human remains, in a state of excellent preservation, have been discovered in various parts of Asia. These include the famous Tarim mummies of Xinjiang, China, some of whom had red and reddish-brown hair. Several preserved samples of human hair have been obtained from an Iron Age cemetery in Khakassia, South Siberia. Many of the hair samples appear red in color, and one skull from the cemetery had a preserved red moustache. In the Book of Wei, Chinese author Wei Shou notes that Liu Yuan was over 6 feet tall and had red strain on his long beard.Helfen-Maenchen, Otto, The World of the Huns: Studies of Their History and Culture, pp.373. University of California Press There are other examples of red hair among early Turkic people. Muqan Qaghan, the third Qaghan of the Turkic Khaganate, was said to have red hair and blue eyes. In Chinese sources, ancient Kyrgyz people were described as fair-skinned, green- or blue-eyed and red-haired people with a mixture of European and East Asian features. The Kipchak people were a Turkic ethnic group from central Asia who served in the Golden Horde military forces after being conquered by the Mongols. In the Chinese historical document 'Kang mu', the Kipchak people are described as red haired and blue eyed. The ethnic Miao people of China are recorded with red hair. According to F.M Savina of the Paris Foreign missionary society the appearance of the Miao were are pale yellow in their skin complexion, almost white, their hair color often being light or dark brown, sometimes even red or corn-silk blond, and a few of them even have pale blue eyes.In appearance the Miao are pale yellow in complexion, almost white, their hair is often light or dark brown, sometimes even red or corn-silk blond, and a few even have pale blue eyes”- F.M, Savina A phenotype study of Hmong People show they are sometimes born with red hair.

Melanesians have a significant incidence of mixed-fair hair, caused by a genetic mutation different from European blond and red hair.Kenny, E, et al., \\"Melanesian Blond Hair Is Caused by an Amino Acid Change in TYRP1\\", Science, 4 May 2012, Vol. 336 no. 6081 p. 554. Several accounts by Greek writers mention redheaded people. A fragment by the poet Xenophanes describes the Thracians as blue-eyed and red-haired.\\"Men make gods in their own image; those of the Ethiopians are black and snub-nosed, those of the Thracians have blue eyes and red hair.\\" Xenophanes of Colophon: Fragments, Xenophanes, J. H. Lesher, University of Toronto Press, 2001, , p. 90. The ancient peoples Budini and Sarmatians are also reported by Greek author to be blue-eyed and red- haired, and the latter even owe their names to it. In Asia, red hair has been found among the ancient Tocharians, who occupied the Tarim Basin in what is now the northwesternmost province of China. Caucasian Tarim mummies have been found with red hair dating to the 2nd millennium BC. Reddish-brown (auburn) hair is also found amongst some Polynesians, and is especially common in some tribes and family groups. In Polynesian culture reddish hair has traditionally been seen as a sign of descent from high-ranking ancestors and a mark of rulership.  Biochemistry and genetics  A close-up view of red hair Roman fresco of a woman with red hair wearing a garland of olives, from Herculaneum, made sometime before the city's destruction in 79 AD by Mount Vesuvius (which also destroyed Pompeii). The pigment pheomelanin gives red hair its distinctive color. Red hair has far more of the pigment pheomelanin than it has of the dark pigment eumelanin. The genetics of red hair appear to be associated with the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), which is found on chromosome 16. Eighty percent of redheads have an MC1R gene variant. Red hair is associated with fair skin color because low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body of those with red hair caused by a MC1R mutation can cause both. The lower melanin concentration in skin confers the advantage that a sufficient concentration of important Vitamin D can be produced under low light conditions. However, when UV-radiation is strong (as in regions close to the equator) the lower concentration of melanin leads to several medical disadvantages, such as a higher risk of skin cancer. The MC1R variant gene that gives people red hair generally results in skin that is difficult or impossible to tan. Because of the natural tanning reaction to the sun's ultraviolet light and high amounts of pheomelanin in the skin, freckles are a common but not universal feature of red-haired people. Red hair can originate from several changes on the MC1R-gene. If one of these changes is present on both chromosomes then the respective individual is likely to have red hair. This type of inheritance is described as an autosomal recessive. Even if both parents do not have red hair themselves, both can be carriers for the gene and have a redheaded child. Genetic studies of dizygotic (fraternal) twins indicate that the MC1R gene is not solely responsible for the red hair phenotype; unidentified modifier genes exist, making variance in the MC1R gene necessary, but not sufficient, for red hair production. = Genetics = The alleles Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, Asp294His, and Arg142His on MC1R are shown to be recessives for the red hair phenotype. The gene HCL2 (also called RHC or RHA) on chromosome 4 may also be related to red hair. There are 8 genetic differences associated with red hair color. In species other than primates, red hair has different genetic origins and mechanisms. = Evolution =  Origins  Red hair is the rarest natural hair color in humans. The non- tanning skin associated with red hair may have been advantageous in far- northern climates where sunlight is scarce. Studies by Bodmer and Cavalli- Sforza (1976) hypothesized that lighter skin pigmentation prevents rickets in colder climates by encouraging higher levels of vitamin D production and also allows the individual to retain heat better than someone with darker skin.Bodmer WF, Cavalli-Sforza LL.Genetics, evolution and man. San Francisco:WH Freeman; 1976. In 2000, Harding et al. concluded that red hair is not the result of positive selection but of a lack of negative selection. In Africa, for example, red hair is selected against because high levels of sun harm pale skin. However, in Northern Europe this does not happen, so redheads can become more common through genetic drift. Estimates on the original occurrence of the currently active gene for red hair vary from 20,000 to 100,000 years ago. A DNA study has concluded that some Neanderthals also had red hair, although the mutation responsible for this differs from that which causes red hair in modern humans.  Extinction hoax  A 2007 report in The Courier-Mail, which cited the National Geographic magazine and unnamed \\"geneticists\\", said that red hair is likely to die out in the near future.Gingers extinct in 100 years.

However, a HowStuffWorks article says that the foundation was funded by hair-dye maker Procter & Gamble, and that other experts had dismissed the research as either lacking in evidence or simply bogus. The National Geographic article in fact states \\"while redheads may decline, the potential for red isn't going away\\".Redhead extinction. HowStuffWorks. Retrieved 28 June 2009. Red hair is caused by a relatively rare recessive allele (variant of a gene), the expression of which can skip generations. It is not likely to disappear at any time in the foreseeable future.  Medical implications of the red hair gene  = Melanoma = Melanin in the skin aids UV tolerance through suntanning, but fair-skinned persons lack the levels of melanin needed to prevent UV-induced DNA-damage. Studies have shown that red hair alleles in MC1R increase freckling and decrease tanning ability. It has been found that Europeans who are heterozygous for red hair exhibit increased sensitivity to UV radiation. Red hair and its relationship to UV sensitivity are of interest to many melanoma researchers. Sunshine can both be good and bad for a person's health and the different alleles on MC1R represent these adaptations. It also has been shown that individuals with pale skin are highly susceptible to a variety of skin cancers such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.Rees JL (2002a) Molecular phototypes.

In: Vogelstein B, Kinzler K (eds) The genetic basis of human cancer, 2nd ed. McGraw-Hill, New York, pp. 529–548 = Pain tolerance and injury = Two studies have demonstrated that people with red hair have different sensitivity to pain to people with other hair colors. One study found that people with red hair are more sensitive to thermal pain (associated with naturally occurring low vitamin K levels), while another study concluded that redheads are less sensitive to pain from multiple modalities, including noxious stimuli such as electrically induced pain. Researchers have found that people with red hair require greater amounts of anesthetic. Other research publications have concluded that women with naturally red hair require less of the painkiller pentazocine than do either women of other hair colors or men of any hair color. A study showed women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to that particular pain medication than men. A follow-up study by the same group showed that men and women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to morphine-6-glucuronide. The unexpected relationship of hair color to pain tolerance appears to exist because redheads have a mutation in a hormone receptor that can apparently respond to at least two types of hormones: the pigmentation-driving melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and the pain- relieving endorphins. (Both derive from the same precursor molecule, POMC, and are structurally similar.) Specifically, redheads have a mutated melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene that produces an altered receptor for MSH. Melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment in skin and hair, use the MC1R to recognize and respond to MSH from the anterior pituitary gland. Melanocyte- stimulating hormone normally stimulates melanocytes to make black eumelanin, but if the melanocytes have a mutated receptor, they will make reddish pheomelanin instead. MC1R also occurs in the brain, where it is one of a large set of POMC-related receptors that are apparently involved not only in responding to MSH, but also in responses to endorphins and possibly other POMC-derived hormones. Though the details are not clearly understood, it appears that there is some crosstalk between the POMC hormones; this may explain the link between red hair and pain tolerance. There is little or no evidence to support the belief that people with red hair have a higher chance than people with other hair colors to hemorrhage or suffer other bleeding complications. One study, however, reports a link between red hair and a higher rate of bruising.  Red hair of pathological origin  Most red hair is caused by the MC1R gene and is non-pathological. However, in rare cases red hair can be associated with disease or genetic disorder: * In cases of severe malnutrition, normally dark human hair may turn red or blonde. The condition, part of a syndrome known as kwashiorkor, is a sign of critical starvation caused chiefly by protein deficiency, and is common during periods of famine. * One variety of albinism (Type 3, a.k.a. rufous albinism), sometimes seen in Africans and inhabitants of New Guinea, results in red hair and red-colored skin.Pathology Guy: Accumulations and Deposits Ed Friedlander, M.D., Pathologist.

Portrait of a Lady, ca. 1470–1475, by Sandro Botticelli Elizabeth I of England, ca. 1588 = Beliefs about temperament = A common belief about redheads is that they have fiery tempers and sharp tongues. In Anne of Green Gables, a character says of Anne Shirley, the redheaded heroine, that \\"her temper matches her hair\\", while in The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield remarks that \\"People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie [his dead brother] never did, and he had very red hair.\\" During the early stages of modern medicine, red hair was thought to be a sign of a sanguine temperament.The Practical Magnetic Healer G. M. Brown 1899 In the Indian medicinal practice of Ayurveda, redheads are seen as most likely to have a Pitta temperament. Another belief is that redheads are highly sexed; for example, Jonathan Swift satirizes redhead stereotypes in part four of Gulliver's Travels, \\"A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms,\\" when he writes that: \\"It is observed that the red-haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and activity.\\" Swift goes on to write that \\"neither was the hair of this brute [a Yahoo] of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an appetite a little irregular) but black as a sloe\\". Such beliefs were given a veneer of scientific credibility in the 19th century by Cesare Lombroso and Guglielmo Ferrero. They concluded that red hair was associated with crimes of lust, and claimed that 48% of \\"criminal women\\" were redheads.Nicole Hahn Rafter (ed), Lombroso & Ferraro, Criminal Woman, the Prostitute, and the Normal Woman, Duke University Press, 2004, pp. 123–24. = Media, fashion and art = The Accolade, 1901, by Edmund Blair Leighton Queen Elizabeth I of England was a redhead, and during the Elizabethan era in England, red hair was fashionable for women. In modern times, red hair is subject to fashion trends; celebrities such as Nicole Kidman, Alyson Hannigan, Marcia Cross, Christina Hendricks, Emma Stone and Geri Halliwell can boost sales of red hair dye. Sometimes, red hair darkens as people get older, becoming a more brownish color or losing some of its vividness. This leads some to associate red hair with youthfulness, a quality that is generally considered desirable. In several countries such as India, Iran, Bangladesh and Pakistan, henna and saffron are used on hair to give it a bright red appearance.Henna – history Plant Cultures: Exploring plants and people. 18 November 2004 Many painters have exhibited a fascination with red hair. The hair color \\"Titian\\" takes its name from the artist Titian, who often painted women with red hair. Early Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli's famous painting The Birth of Venus depicts the mythological goddess Venus as a redhead. Other painters notable for their redheads include the Pre- Raphaelites, Edmund Leighton, Modigliani, and Gustav Klimt. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story \\"The Red-Headed League\\" (1891) involves a man who is asked to become a member of a mysterious group of red-headed people. The 1943 film DuBarry Was a Lady featured red-heads Lucille Ball and Red Skelton in Technicolor. Notable fictional characters with red hair includes Jean Grey, Red Sonja, Mystique, and Poison Ivy. = Prejudice and discrimination against redheads =  Medieval beliefs  Barbarossa (Redbeard), Ottoman Admiral Red hair was thought to be a mark of a beastly sexual desire and moral degeneration. A savage red-haired man is portrayed in the fable by Grimm brothers (Der Eisenhans) as the spirit of the forest of iron. Theophilus Presbyter describes how the blood of a red-haired young man is necessary to create gold from copper, in a mixture with the ashes of a basilisk.Palo Galloni, Il sacro artefice, Laterza, Bari 1998 (Italian book, chapter 2 about the recipe of Theophilus De auro hyspanico). Montague Summers, in his translation of the Malleus Maleficarum, – see Malleus Maleficarum notes that red hair and green eyes were thought to be the sign of a witch, a werewolf or a vampire during the Middle Ages;  Medieval antisemitism  Fagin in a watercolour by 'Kyd' During the Spanish Inquisition, people of red hair were identified as Jewish and isolated for persecution. In Medieval Italy and Spain, red hair was associated with the heretical nature of Jews and their rejection of Jesus, and thus Judas Iscariot was commonly depicted as red- haired in Italian and Spanish art. Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair, with red-hair being given by the authors to villainous Jewish characters such as Shylock and Fagin.Shakespeare and the Mediterranean: the selected proceedings of the International Shakespeare Association World Congress, Valencia, 2001, Theatres and Performances, (University of Delaware Press, 2004), page 40 The antisemitic association persisted into modern times in Soviet Russia. The medieval prejudice against red-hair may have derived from the Ancient biblical tradition, in relation to biblical figures such as Esau and King David. The Ancient historian Josephus would mistranslate the Hebrew Torah to describe the more positive figure of King David as 'golden haired', in contrast to the negative figure of Esau, even though the original Hebrew Torah implies that both King David and Esau had 'fiery red hair'.Interpretation of Scripture in Early Judaism and Christianity: Studies in Language and Tradition, Craig A. Evans, Bloomsbury Publishing, 13 December 2004, page 177-178  Modern-day discrimination  In his 1885 book I Say No, Wilkie Collins wrote \\"The prejudice against habitual silence, among the lower order of the people, is almost as inveterate as the prejudice against red hair.\\" In his 1895 memoir and history The Gurneys of Earlham, Augustus John Cuthbert Hare described an incident of harassment: \\"The second son, John, was born in 1750. As a boy he had bright red hair, and it is amusingly recorded that one day in the streets of Norwich a number of boys followed him, pointing to his red locks and saying, \\"Look at that boy; he's got a bonfire on the top of his head,\\" and that John Gurney was so disgusted that he went to a barber's, had his head shaved, and went home in a wig. He grew up, however, a remarkably attractive- looking young man.\\" In British English, the word \\"ginger\\" is sometimes used to describe red-headed people (at times in an insulting manner), with terms such as \\"gingerphobia\\"Gingerphobia: Carrot-tops see red BBC News, 22 February 2000 and \\"gingerism\\" used by the British media. In Britain, redheads are also sometimes referred to disparagingly as \\"carrot tops\\" and \\"carrot heads\\". (The comedian \\"Carrot Top\\" uses this stage name.) \\"Gingerism\\" has been compared to racism, although this is widely disputed, and bodies such as the UK Commission for Racial Equality do not monitor cases of discrimination and hate crimes against redheads. Nonetheless, individuals and families in Britain are targeted for harassment and violence because of their hair colour. In 2003, a 20-year-old was stabbed in the back for \\"being ginger\\". In 2007, a UK woman won an award from a tribunal after being sexually harassed and receiving abuse because of her red hair; in the same year, a family in Newcastle upon Tyne, was forced to move twice after being targeted for abuse and hate crime on account of their red hair.Red-haired family forced to move BBC News, 2 June 2007 In May 2009, a schoolboy committed suicide after being bullied for having red hair.Schoolboy bullied over ginger hair hanged himself Daily Telegraph, 12 May 2009 In 2013, a fourteen-year-old boy in Lincoln had his right arm broken and his head stamped on by three men who attacked him \\"just because he had red hair\\". The three men were subsequently jailed for a combined total of ten years and one month for the attack. A possible fringe theory explaining the historical and modern mistreatment of red-heads supposedly stems from Roman subjugation and consequent persecution of Celtic Nations when arriving in the British Isles. This prejudice has been satirised on a number of TV shows. English comedian Catherine Tate (herself a redhead) appeared as a red-haired character in a running sketch of her series The Catherine Tate Show. The sketch saw fictional character Sandra Kemp, who was forced to seek solace in a refuge for ginger people because she had been ostracised from society.Catherine Tate: Ginger Refuge video Gingerism.com, 18 December 2008 The British comedy Bo' Selecta! (starring redhead Leigh Francis) featured a spoof documentary which involved a caricature of Mick Hucknall presenting a show in which celebrities (played by themselves) dyed their hair red for a day and went about daily life being insulted by people. (Hucknall, who says that he has repeatedly faced prejudice or been described as ugly on account of his hair colour, argues that Gingerism should be described as a form of racism.) Comedian Tim Minchin, himself a redhead, also covered the topic in his song \\"Prejudice\\". The pejorative use of the word \\"ginger\\" and related discrimination was used to illustrate a point about racism and prejudice in the \\"Ginger Kids\\", \\"Le Petit Tourette\\", \\"It's a Jersey Thing\\" and \\"Fatbeard\\" episodes of South Park. Film and television programmes often portray school bullies as having red hair. However, children with red hair are often themselves targeted by bullies; \\"Somebody with ginger hair will stand out from the crowd,\\" says anti-bullying expert Louise Burfitt-Dons. In Australian slang, redheads are often nicknamed \\"Blue\\" or \\"Bluey\\". More recently, they have been referred to as \\"rangas\\" (a word derived from the red-haired ape, the orangutan), sometimes with derogatory connotations. The word \\"rufus\\" has been used in both Australian and British slang to refer to red-headed people; based on a variant of rufous, a reddish-brown color. In November 2008 social networking website Facebook received criticism after a 'Kick a Ginger' group, which aimed to establish a \\"National Kick a Ginger Day\\" on 20 November, acquired almost 5,000 members. A 14-year-old boy from Vancouver who ran the Facebook group was subjected to an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for possible hate crimes. In December 2009 British supermarket chain Tesco withdrew a Christmas card which had the image of a child with red hair sitting on the lap of Father Christmas, and the words: \\"Santa loves all kids. Even ginger ones\\" after customers complained the card was offensive.\\"Tesco apologises over 'ginger jibe' card\\". BBC News. 14 December 2009. Retrieved 28 December 2009. In October 2010, Harriet Harman, the former Equality Minister in the British government under Labour, faced accusations of prejudice after she described the red-haired Treasury secretary Danny Alexander as a \\"ginger rodent\\". Alexander responded to the insult by stating that he was \\"proud to be ginger\\".\\"Harriet Harman says 'ginger rodent' comment was wrong\\". BBC News. 30 October 2010. Harman was subsequently forced to apologise for the comment, after facing criticism for prejudice against a minority group. In September 2011, Cryos International, one of the world's largest sperm banks, announced that it would no longer accept donations from red-haired men due to low demand from women seeking artificial insemination.  Use of term in Singapore and Malaysia  The term ang mo () in Hokkien (Min Nan) Chinese, meaning \\"red- haired\\", is used in Malaysia and Singapore, although it refers to all white people, never exclusively people with red hair. The epithet is sometimes rendered as ang mo kui () meaning \\"red-haired devil\\", similar to the Cantonese term gweilo (\\"foreign devil\\"). Thus it is viewed as racist and derogatory by some people.See, for instance, ; Others, however, maintain it is acceptable.For instance, Despite this ambiguity, it is a widely used term. It appears, for instance, in Singaporean newspapers such as The Straits Times,; and in television programmes and films. The Chinese characters for ang mo are the same as those in the historical Japanese term Kōmō (), which was used during the Edo period (1603–1868) as an epithet for Dutch or Northern European people. It primarily referred to Dutch traders who were the only Europeans allowed to trade with Japan during Sakoku, its 200-year period of isolation.See, for example, ; ; ; ; ;  The name \\"Rory\\"  The mainly masculine given name Rory - a name of Goidelic origin, which is an anglicisation of the /Ruaidhrí/Ruaidhrígh/Raidhrígh, and Manx: Rauree which is common to the Irish, Highland Scots and their diasporas for the given name \\"Rory\\". \\\\- means \\"red-haired king\\", from ruadh (\\"red-haired\\" or \\"rusty\\") and rígh (\\"king\\"). However, present bearers of the name are by no means all red- haired themeselves. = Red hair festivals = Hundreds of redheads together at the Redhead Day, September 2007 There has been an annual Redhead Day festival in the Netherlands that attracts red-haired participants from around the world. The festival was held in Breda, a city in the south east of the Netherlands, prior to 2019, when it moved to Tilburg. It attracts participants from over 80 different countries. The international event began in 2005, when Dutch painter Bart Rouwenhorst decided he wanted to paint 15 redheads. The Irish Redhead Convention, held in late August in County Cork since 2011, claims to be a global celebration and attracts people from several continents. The celebrations include crowning the ginger King and Queen, competitions for the best red eyebrows and most freckles per square inch, orchestral concerts and carrot throwing competitions. A smaller red-hair day festival is held since 2013 by the UK's anti bullying alliance in London, with the aim of instilling pride in having red-hair. Since 2014, a red-hair event is held in Israel, at Kibbutz Gezer (Carrot), held for the local Israeli red hair community, including both Ashkenazi and Mizrahi red-heads.Fifty shades of orange: A conference on Kibbutz Gezer redheads By Hagai Matar, Mekomit.co.il, 28 August 2014. However, the number of attendees has to be restricted due to the risk of rocket attacks, leading to anger in the red-hair community.Finally, a Red Alert This Summer That (Most) Israelis Welcomed Roy Arad, Haaretz.com, 30 August 2014. The organizers state; \\"The event is a good thing for many redheads, who had been embarrassed about being redheads before.\\" The first and only festival for red heads in the United States was launched in 2015. Held in Highwood, Illinois, Redhead Days draws participants from across the United States. A festival to celebrate the red-haired people is held annually in Izhevsk (Russia), the capital of Udmurtia, since 2004. MC1R Magazine is a publication for red-haired people worldwide, based in Hamburg, Germany. = Religious and mythological traditions = In ancient Egypt red hair was associated with the deity Set and Ramesses II had it.Brier, Egyptian Mummies (1994), pp. 200–01. In the Iliad, Achilles' hair is described as (), usually translated as blonde, or golden but sometimes as red or tawny. His son Neoptolemus also bears the name Pyrrhus, a possible reference to his own red hair. The Norse god Thor is usually described as having red hair. Mary Magdalene is commonly portrayed with long red hair, as in this 1859 painting by Anthony Frederick Augustus Sandys The Hebrew word usually translated \\"ruddy\\" or \\"reddish-brown\\" (admoni , from the root ADM , see also Adam and Edom) was used to describe both Esau and David. Early artistic representations of Mary Magdalene usually depict her as having long flowing red hair, although a description of her hair color was never mentioned in the Bible, and it is possible the color is an effect caused by pigment degradation in the ancient paint. Judas Iscariot is also represented with red hair in Spanish culture and in the works of William Shakespeare, reinforcing the negative stereotype.

It was signed by German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Japanese ambassador to Germany Kintomo Mushakoji. Italy, Spain and other countries joined it until November 1941. The Japanese signatories had hoped that the Anti-Comintern Pact would effectively be an alliance against the Soviet Union, which is certainly how the Soviets perceived it. There was also a secret additional protocol which specified a joint German-Japanese policy specifically aimed against the Soviet Union. However, after the accession of Fascist Italy to the pact and especially the German-Soviet rapprochement after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, it gained an increasingly anti-western and anti-British identity as well. After August 1939, Japan distanced itself from Germany as a result of the Molotov- Ribbentrop Pact. The Anti-Comintern Pact was supplanted by the September 1940 Tripartite Pact, which identified the United States as the primary threat rather than the Soviet Union, as the principal document that united the interests of the Axis powers. Afterwards, membership in the Anti-Comintern Pact became largely ceremonial, but the renewal in November 1941 saw the entry of several new members into the pact.  Background  = Germany =  The \\"Anti-Komintern\\" (GDAV) in Germany  The Anti-Komintern, officially the Gesamtverband Deutscher antikommunistischer Vereinigungen (abbr. GDAV, 'general association of German anti-communist federations'), was a German agency established by Joseph Goebbels in 1933. Its activities covered a wide range of operations designed to denounce communism in general and the Soviet Union in particular, push antisemitic propaganda and to garner domestic and international support for Nazi policy. It was placed under the leadership Dr. Adolf Ehrt [de]. Under Ehrt's leadership, the Comintern was denounced as 'godless' in reference to its atheism. Beginning in July 1936, the Spanish Civil War became a main focus for the Anti-Komintern's publications. One of the Anti-Komintern's most significant outputs was the 1936 international release Der Weltbolschewismus, in which it connected various anti-communist and anti-semitic conspiracy theories for the consumption of the international audience. The book was not released in Germany itself to avoid conflict between the book's varied accounts with German state propaganda.  Anglo- German Naval Agreement, June 1935  On 18 June 1935, Anglo-German Naval Agreement was signed between the United Kingdom and Germany, which came as a surprise to the Japanese. This marked the beginning of a series of attempts by Adolf Hitler to improve relations between the two countries. In Hitler's mind, a positive relationship towards the United Kingdom would weaken Britain's allies France and Italy (at that point still a German rival) and contain the Soviet Union. Hitler would later also send Ribbentrop to London with the specific task of securing British membership in the Anti-Comintern Pact during his 1936–1938 tenure as German ambassador to the United Kingdom, declaring British accession into the pact as his 'greatest wish'. In Japan, the treaty was viewed with suspicion. Mushakoji on 4 July 1935 in an embassy meeting stated his opinion that it would be unwise for Japan to rush into an alliance with Germany, as he (correctly) interpreted the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as a German attempt to ally the UK. The United States and Britain had been hostile towards Japan ever since the Mukden Incident of 1931, and Mushakoji feared that Japan might isolate itself if Germany ended up choosing a partnership with Britain over a partnership with Japan.  Competing authorities and ideologies in German foreign policy  The execution of German foreign policy was nominally left to Konstantin von Neurath's foreign ministry, but Joachim von Ribbentrop headed the semi-autonomous Dienststelle Ribbentrop, created in late 1934, where he could carry out Hitler's personal foreign policy requests independently from foreign ministry consent. This created a rivalry between the two services. While Hitler favored Ribbentrop as his personal foreign policy champion, he at least initially maintained Neurath's staff of career diplomats to maximize his government's diplomatic legitimacy abroad. Hiroshi Ōshima, Japanese military attaché in Berlin and the single most important individual on the Japanese side of the Anti-Comintern Pact's negotiations, interpreted the German foreign service structure as one where the power structure was such that \\"it was only Hitler and Ribbentrop who decided foreign policy, and that it was therefore of no use to talk to their subordinates\\". Ōshima thus attempted to get any important step of the negotiations to Ribbentrop's or Hitler's desks directly.Joachim von RibbentropWhile Ribbentrop was Hitler's personal diplomat of choice, his personal view on geostrategic diplomacy varied quite distinctly from Hitler's during the late 1930s: Whereas Hitler favored a friendly policy towards Britain to eliminate the Soviet Union, Ribbentrop saw the western allies as Germany's main enemy and designed much of German foreign policy, including the Anti-Comintern Pact, with the goal to contain the British Empire in mind. When it came to Japan, Ribbentrop believed that the Japanese focus on the Soviet Union as its main antagonist could be redirected towards the United Kingdom, thus enabling Japan to be a partner in Ribbentrop's anti-British coalition. German alignment with Japan, against the wishes of the traditionally sinophile German foreign service and German public at large, began at the end of 1933.  German-Soviet interwar treaties  During the time of the Weimar Republic, the German government had made major treaties with the USSR, including the 1922 Treaty of Rapallo and the 1926 Treaty of Berlin. In a note on the day of the signing, 25 November, Ribbentrop informed Mushakoji that the German government viewed these treaties' terms as void under the secret additional protocol. Mushakoji replied on the same day, expressing the Japanese government's \\"sincere satisfaction\\" with the German stance. This had been a result of the Japanese government's insistence, most notably in a request on 24 July 1936, to clarify the treaty's implications for past bilateral treaties between either party and the Soviet Union. = Japan =  The Japanese \\"Versailles\\": The Racial Equality Proposal of 1919 and the Washington Naval Conference of 1922  Japan had fought in the Great War on the side of the victorious Entente Powers. However, as part of the Washington Naval Conference of 1922, the United States and United Kingdom successfully managed to both limit Japan's naval forces by treaty and to force Japan to surrender her gains in China made during World War I. While there were some advantages for Tokyo gained during the conference – it was granted parity with USA and UK in the Pacific Ocean and was entitled to build a navy that would outmatch the French and Italian navies, as well as being recognized as the world's only non-western colonial power – the treaty was unpopular in Japan. Japanese nationalists, as well as the Imperial Japanese Navy, denounced the treaty's restrictive aspects. Culturally, the 1922 Washington Treaty was viewed as yet another betrayal by the western powers, after the Japanese proposals for guaranteed racial equality under the League of Nations had been rejected in 1919. This perception of national humiliation was further accelerated by the economic downturn that Japan experienced in the 1920s, exemplified by the 1927 financial panic in Japan (Shōwa financial crisis), which had also caused political instability and the fall of the first cabinet of Reijirō Wakatsuki, and by the 1929 Great Depression. German historian Bernd Martin dubbed the Washington Naval Conference the \\"Japanese 'Versailles'.\\"  Japanese societal militarization and the aggression against China, 1931–1936  Japanese troops entering Shenyang during the 1931 Mukden Incident The Mukden Incident of 18 September 1931 began the period of Japanese aggression in Asia between 1931 and 1945, sometimes called the Fifteen Years War. The diplomatic reaction of the European great powers to Japan's attack against China was insufficient to stop the Japanese advance, despite continued Chinese appeals to the League of Nations. This attack, which had no central order from Tokyo precede it and was rather an autonomous decision by the Kwantung Army leadership, was kept confined to North East China by the Japanese commanders in the hopes that this would be enough to keep European responses lukewarm and thus further Japanese advances. This consideration proved to be accurate, and the United Kingdom in particular was more than happy to let Japan proceed in Manchuria as long as British interests in southern and central China remained undisturbed. Even after the Shanghai Incident of 28 January 1932, the British attitude remained on the whole friendly to the Japanese cause and indifferent towards Chinese please for assistance. Among the few exceptions to this were British efforts to bring about peace in the city of Shanghai itself, where the UK had direct economic interests. The Japanese Pacification of Manchukuo on the other hand was viewed in Britain as a positive development that ultimately would help to disperse bandit activity. In February 1932, the Japanese established a puppet state in North East China, the Empire of Manchukuo, nominally headed by Puyi, the dethroned last emperor of the Qing dynasty (r. 1908–1912, 1917). In response to the Lytton Report, which laid the blame for the conflict in Manchuria firmly at the feet of the Japanese, Sir John Simon, the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom, failed to condemn Japan in his speech on 7 December 1932, and subsequently earned the favor of Japanese politicians like Yōsuke Matsuoka, who viewed the lackluster British response as further encouragement for the Japanese course in China. Japan left the League of Nations as a result of the Lytton Report in February 1933. The Tanggu Truce ended the hostilities in Manchuria, but Japanese ambition in China was not yet satisfied. Between 1933 and 1936, Japanese foreign minister Kōki Hirota pursued the , the 'friendly diplomacy of Hirota'. Summed up by the Amau Doctrine of 1934, Japan viewed itself as the protective power of all of East Asia, mirroring the role of the United States in the Americas under the Monroe Doctrine of 1823. This posturing was again permitted by the European great powers, and Neville Chamberlain even attempted to negotiate an Anglo-Japanese non-aggression pact to improve British relations with Japan in 1934. In secret, Hirota's foreign policy leadership set an array of highly ambitious goals for Japan's diplomacy. This included an industrial buildup in Manchukuo, the acquisition of resources from North China via subjugation, conquest of the western Pacific and South East Asia, and preparations for a war against the Soviet Union.The Japanese army in October 1934 published a pamphlet entitled \\"The Essence of National Defense and Proposals to Strengthen It\\", going directly against the attempt of diplomatic reconciliation that was at the same time (at least half- heartedly) attempted by the civilian government in Tokyo (named \\"Shidehara diplomacy\\" after former Prime Minister Kijūrō Shidehara). The pamphlet demanding a complete subjugation of all aspects of foreign and domestic policy to the all-encompassing question of \\"national defense\\" and the nation's preparation for total war. It further denounced \\"cooperative diplomacy\\", lauded the Japanese decision to withdraw from the League of Nations and called upon Japan to accept its fate and to formulate a great plan for the upcoming century. The military subsequently continued its practice of publishing pamphlets with overt political content without prior coordination with the civilian government. In November 1936, about the time of the Anti-Comintern Pact's conclusion, the army pamphlet \\"Perfecting the Army's Preparedness and the Spirit Required\\" advocated strengthening the army and openly called for the reform of the civilian government and the reform of the Japanese state to better suit the military's goals.  Domestic power struggles about Japanese foreign policy: Army, Navy, Foreign Ministry  The Japanese imperial state's system was dubbed \\"a cone without vertex\\" by Japanese historian Ken Ishida. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA), Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) and the Japanese foreign ministry each had their own agenda with regards as to how Japan should orient its foreign policy. The Japanese system, highly traditional and based around the spiritual and socio-cultural value of Emperor Hirohito, also involved the imperial court, which served as a buffer between these three rival groups and the Emperor at the top, which allowed Hirohito to escape direct political responsibilities for any failures and setbacks that the system might produce.  Japanese-Soviet fishery treaty negotiations and border disputes  At the time of the negotiations for the Anti-Comintern Pact, the Japanese government was also in negotiations with the Soviet government over fishing rights in the Sea of Japan. As the Anti-Comintern Pact's secret additional protocol between Germany and Japan against the USSR was to forbid political treaties by either state without expressed mutual consent with the Soviet Union, Japanese ambassador Mushakoji was concerned if the treaty would result in consequences for the Japanese-Soviet negotiations. He inquired about it in a letter to Ribbentrop after the signing of the treaty on 25 November, and also mentioned the issue of border questions between Japanese-controlled Manchukuo and the USSR. Ribbentrop confirmed the German government's assent that Japan was autonomous and free to proceed in the matters mentioned by Mushakojiin his reply on the same day. = Ideological similarities and contradictions between Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan = The Anti-Comintern Pact was more of a statement than an actual political commitment, and the statement was one of mutual ideological alignment and diplomatic attachment to one another. Both countries shared examples of very politically significant racial ideologies, with Alfred Rosenberg in Germany and Shūmei Ōkawa in Japan becoming the leading racialist ideologues. Whereas Rosenberg enjoyed government backing and was a central party figure after the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, Ōkawa's audience was more limited. Ōkawa found his main support base with young nationalistic military officers, particularly those in the Kwantung Army, the military unit that instigated Japan's initial invasion of North East China in 1931. Ōkawa's work was in late 1936 furthered by Takeo Nimiya's influential foreign policy pamphlet \\"The Unique Principles Guiding Japanese Diplomacy\\", in which Takeo laid out a vision of a long-term orientation of Japanese diplomacy around a racially justified expansionist policy based on traditional Japanese spiritual values rather than western- style imperialism. Nimiya's pamphlet was especially popular with young bureaucrats and students that were about to enter Japanese state politics in the late 1930s and early 1940s.The two countries shared a common ideological antagonist in the communism, which was extensively covered in the German and Japanese media and perceived as a real threat of subversion among German and Japanese political elites. As a result of Japanese reservations about an outright military alliance, the Anti-Comintern Pact was conceptualized as an anti-communist agreement rather than an outright military alliance. However, the Japanese military establishment was concerned about the growth of Soviet military strength, and Japanese military attachés in Europe had held conferences about the potential threat coming specifically from the USSR as early as 1929 to discuss potential countermeasures. The Japanese government on 8 August 1936 issued an internal document that specifically justified the German-Japanese alliance as a response to the growing threat that the Soviet Union posed in Asia and the close parallels between Japanese and German interests regarding the USSR. This document also revealed intentions to include other European, Islamic and Asian countries in the anti-Soviet pact and specifically named Poland as a potential candidate for pact membership. Both the Japanese and German movements shared an aversion towards the League of Nations, and both countries left the League over the course of the year 1933. The two countries shared a similar list of diplomatic adversaries: The United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. While the German and Japanese racial ideologies of the supposed superiority of the Aryan race and the Yamato race, respectively, showed parallels, these parallels should logically have made the alliance less likely, as the two countries' fascisms viewed each other as racially inferior. In fact, Hitler's Mein Kampf specifically names the Japanese as an example of a racial grouping on the second out of three cultural tiers, a step down from the Aryan race on the top. To prevent diplomatic complications as a result of German racial thought, German racist propaganda in the state-controlled press was directed away from the topic of the Japanese people as to not irritate Japan. = Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, July 1935 = At the Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, following the advice of Georgi Dimitrov to the Soviet government that had resulted from Dimitrov's experiences in France and Austria during the year of 1934, the Communist Internationale drastically changed the course that communist parties were advised to take in democratic systems: Instead of viewing the democratic and fascist parties as politically allied (social fascism), the communist movements were encouraged to ally with leftist and centrist forces (the policy of the popular front) in order to prevent the rightists from gaining ground. Diplomatically, the Seventh World Congress also brought on the 'collective security' policy in the Soviet Union, wherein the USSR would attempt to align with the western democracies to counteract the fascist regimes. This created an urgency for the European fascists to prevent the strengthening of leftist popular fronts against them. The Seventh World Congress specifically declared fascist Germany and Japan, next to Poland, to be among the world's chief instigators of war. This declaration accelerated Ribbentrop's efforts to secure a German-Japanese alliance against the USSR, or at least a promise of non-support for the Soviet Union in case of a war between one of the countries against it. = The role of China in German- Japanese relations = The Republic of China was an important partner to the Germans, but a bitter enemy of the Japanese Empire, as Japan had invaded Manchuria in 1931. Although Ribbentrop hoped to involve both China and Japan in his anti-communist bloc, the continued hostilities and eventual outbreak of war made the ambivalent German position, including the Sino-German military cooperation and the status of Alexander von Falkenhausen and other military advisors to Chiang Kai-shek, a serious concern to both of the Asian states. Furthermore, China was the biggest trade partner for German businesses in Asia. China was also favored by the German military establishment and the armament industry, as the Chinese military was an important customer for German arms manufacturers and heavy industry. Chinese exports to Germany were also seen as vital, including deliveries of tin and tungsten. During his time as Japanese ambassador to Germany, Mushakoji made it one of his goals to undermine German-Chinese economic and diplomatic relations. Within Germany's foreign service, Ribbentrop favored cooperation with Japan, whereas Neurath preferred alignment with China. One of the major questions in the German foreign service in regards to Germany's diplomatic ambivalence between China and Japan was the recognition of the Japanese puppet state in Manchukuo, installed after the 1931 Japanese invasion of North East China. A recognition of Manchukuo, as suggested by German ambassador in Tokyo Herbert von Dirksen beginning in early 1934, would have clearly presented a German statement in favor of Japanese expansionism and would have disturbed Germany's Chinese partners. As a result of the possible irritation of the Chinese government and the potential misgivings of the Soviet government about the potential perception of an attempted encirclement by a German-Japanese entente, such a recognition of Manchukuo was initially opposed by Neurath and the foreign ministry. In response to his initial request to recognize Manchukuo, Dirksen was instructed to avoid \\"any close relations with Japan which might lay [Germany] open to being suspected of wishing to render assistance against Russia\\". This German caution towards any offense cast against the Soviet Union resulted from the impression in Berlin that Japan during the year 1934 was under serious threat of diplomatic and military encirclement. Specifically, Dirksen was also instructed to pay close attention to any signs of a potential war between Japan and the USSR, which the Germans assumed the Soviet Union would probably receive the aid of the western democracies in it were to break out, although this potential war was not perceived as immediately imminent. Regardless, the German foreign service sought at all costs to avoid entanglement in such a conflict. Inversely, the Japanese political and military establishments were by 1934 also less than certain about the usefulness of the new Hitler government in Germany, which Tokyo assumed would attempt to maintain a peaceful relationship with the Soviet Union and avoid any open alignment with Moscow's enemies. The distrust that Japan felt was partially caused by the close relationship between Germany and China, which in turn was perceived as an ally of the Soviet Union against Japan. After the Anti-Comintern Pact's signing, Falkenhausen was recalled to Germany against his will after Japanese pressure in 1938, and China eventually declared war on Germany and Italy, along with Japan, on 9 December 1941, in the aftermath of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the American entry into World War II, citing German and Italian support for Japanese aggression as the reason. = Instability in France = The domestic situation in the French Third Republic was unstable. This provided the opportunity for France's rivals, especially Germany, to expand their influence, while at the same time weakening France's European partners, like Poland and Czechoslovakia. The cabinet of Léon Blum, supported by France's popular front, had taken the reins in June 1936. The social instability and political violence within France made the French government internationally careful and ineffective in applying France's otherwise extensive diplomatic and military power. Hitler, who expected France's popular front to result in a situation similar to the Spanish Civil War, openly announced to the French ambassador on 6 October 1936 that a communist takeover in France would not be treated by Germany as a domestic affair. In French foreign policy, the 1934 German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact had caused concerns about the stability of the French alliance system in eastern Europe, leading to a French realignment towards the Soviet Union that resulted in the 1936 Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance. = German, Italian and Soviet involvement in the Spanish Civil War = The Spanish Civil War, in which Germany supported the Nationalists and the Soviet Union the Republicans, reinforced the urgency in the mind of the German leadership to create some sort of anti-Soviet military arrangement to counteract a potential aggression by the Soviet Union. The Spanish nationalists also received aid from Mussolini's Italy (Corpo Truppe Volontarie), but the Italian attitude to a potential anti-communist or anti-Soviet agreement was initially the opposite of the German position: the Italians viewed the signing of an anti-communist treaty as superfluous, as Italy's anti-communist commitment was in the Italian viewpoint sufficiently proven in their support for the Spanish nationalists. The Spanish Civil War was viewed by the Germans as concrete proof that the teachings of the Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, which had been specifically aimed against Germany (and Japan), were indeed affecting geopolitics.  Creation of the Pact, 1935–1936  = Early designs by Dienststelle Ribbentrop and Hiroshi Ōshima, 1935 = Hiroshi Ōshima After the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the Seventh World Congress, the German Dienststelle Ribbentrop envisioned in October 1935 an anti-communist diplomatic system that might involve both the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China. This idea had support on the Japanese side by Hiroshi Ōshima, then the military attaché for Japan in Berlin, although Ōshima was more concerned with a Japanese subjugation of China rather than with an equal Japanese- Chinese alliance against the Soviet Union. The Nationalist government in China was unwilling to make deals with Japan as long as the Japanese occupation of Manchuria persisted, so Ōshima and Ribbentrop drafted a bilateral treaty between Germany and Japan. Originally, the treaty was scheduled for November 1935, and invitations were to be extended to China, the United Kingdom, Italy and Poland. However, the German military and diplomatic leadership stalled the treaty's realization, as they feared a breakdown in the German relations with China. Furthermore, foreign minister Konstantin von Neurath was jealous of Ribbentrop's exalted position in foreign policy outside of the ministry's control. While the initial designs for the pact came from Dienststelle Ribbentrop, Hiroshi Ōshima, who would himself become Japan's ambassador to Germany 1938–1939 and 1941–1945, became very influential in the pact's outline on the Japanese side. While the government in Tokyo was not particularly proactive in the pact's creation, Ōshima and the staff of the Japanese embassy in Berlin were. When Mushakoji stated his suspicions of the German intentions to the embassy personnel on 4 July 1935, Ōshima was the main source of disagreement within the staff. Regardless, Mushakoji ended up making the recommendation to the Japanese government to only pursue an alliance with German insofar it didn't end up in a deterioration of Japanese relations with the United Kingdom and United States. Ōshima was a staunch anti-communist and veteran of the Japanese intervention in Siberia, and used his good connections within Germany, among others to Wilhelm Canaris of the Abwehr, to, without authorization from ambassador Mushakoji, further his pro-German and anti- Soviet agenda within the embassy. Initially disgusted with the military and political weakness of the Weimar Republic when he first arrived in Germany in 1922, he became an admirer of Adolf Hitler following the National Socialists' rise to power in 1933, and concluded that 'there were things in the new Germany which were worthy of serious consideration'. Ōshima was aided by the fact he spoke the German language with a high degree of fluency. His positive predispositions towards the NSDAP government made him useful in the anti- Soviet designs of the Imperial Japanese Army, which aimed to envelop the Soviet Union through an alliance with Germany, eventually planning to strike into Siberia to secure its natural resources for Japan (Hokushin-ron). Ōshima's instructions from high command were to investigate the German government's stability, the future of the German military and the state of German-Soviet military and diplomatic relations. Ōshima followed his assignment diligently, and the high frequency of his visits to and inspections of the German military establishment was noted even by the American military attaché Hugh W. Rowan, one of whose tasks was to observe Japanese covert activity in Berlin. Rowan was soon convinced that Ōshima was \\"being given access to important technical information in possession of the German army\\". The threat posed by the Soviet Union remained Ōshima's principal concern, and he aggressively sought out all German information on Soviet military strength he could attain. His aforementioned relationship with Canaris of the Abwehr was also largely based on the prospect of a potential German-Japanese intelligence service cooperation against the Soviet Union. By 1937, he would also forge close contacts with Wilhelm Keitel, the later Chief of OKW.One of Ōshima's old associates from the time of the Weimar Republic, Friedrich Wilhelm Hack [de], had by 1934 joined the new Dienststelle Ribbentrop. Hack served as the networker between Ōshima, Canaris and German minister of defense Werner von Blomberg, organizing meetings in Freiburg, starting in early 1935. Hack was instrumental in establishing personal contacts for Ōshima and was the most important link between him and Joachim von Ribbentrop, who Ōshima viewed as the single most important person on the German side after Hitler himself. Ōshima first met with Ribbentrop in March 1935. Ribbentrop reported to Hitler, according to his (Ribbentrop's) testimony at Nuremberg, that he 'personally had certain connections with Japanese persons'. Historian Carl Boyd interprets this as a reference to the contact with Ōshima established via Hack. With Hitler's tentative approval (Hitler was uncertain of Ōshima's authority and wanted Ribbentrop to ascertain the opinions of the higher-ups in the Japanese military establishment), negotiations between Ōshima and Ribbentrop went into full swing in fall of 1935. = Negotiations, 1935–1936 =  1935  Starting with the meetings in October, which at some point involved Hitler himself, Ōshima presented his idea of a promise of mutual assistance in case of an attack one of the two countries by the Soviet Union. At this point, Ōshima's telegrams to the Japanese army were enthusiastic about the diplomatic potential of the negotiations, up to and including the possibility of an open German-Japanese military alliance, even though both sides were more immediately comfortable at that point with a less impactful agreement to not aid the Soviet Union in case of a Soviet war against the other party. Such a 'no aid'-agreement was easier to fit into each country's respective grand strategies. Ōshima's extensive involvement was essential to the formation of the Anti-Comintern Pact, but was also the source of some discomfort among the Japanese military and diplomatic leaderships, as Ōshima had far overextended his military assignment with his unauthorized diplomatic cooperation with Ribbentrop and even Hitler himself. But instead of the severe punishment that a junior officer like Ōshima might have otherwise received for his reckless dealings with a foreign head of government, Ōshima's advance was acknowledged positively by the Japanese hyper-militarists, who were sympathetic to Hitler's policies and impressed by Ōshima's successes. In late October 1935, the chief of the Japanese army's general staff, Prince Kan'in Kotohito, signalled that the army was positively predisposed towards a pact with Germany. Kotohito had been a close associate of Hiroshi Ōshima's father Ken'ichi Ōshima, Japan's Minister of the Army 1916–1918, and was thus positively predisposed towards Hiroshi Ōshima's activity in Europe, and likely one of Ōshima's protectors in the question of Ōshima stepping out of line of his initial assignments. Kotohito assigned a general staff intelligence officer, Tadaichi Wakamatsu, with a mission in Berlin that involved ascertaining the German attitude towards a German-Japanese agreement directed against the Soviet Union. Meetings between Wakamatsu, Ōshima and Blomberg in November and December 1935 achieved little, although Wakamatsu signalled the general willingness of the Japanese army to negotiate a treaty with Germany. He was sceptical of the Dienststelle's semi-official state within the German foreign service. However, the IJA in principle remained open to the idea, and Wakamatsu left Germany for Japan in December 1935 with the understanding that both sides would seek government approval for the pact. Wakamatsu and Kotohito were overall unprepared to deal with the remarkable progress that Ōshima reported in his messages and the potential magnitude of the resulting German-Japanese treaty. Near the end of 1935, the Soviet Red Army intelligence intercepted several secret telegrams between Ōshima and the Japanese General Staff. This information was forwarded to the Soviet embassy in Japan, from which the American embassy also heard news of the ongoing secret negotiations between Germany and Japan. This marked the first time that the Soviet Union is confirmed to have received word of the ongoing negotiations of the Anti- Comintern Pact.  1936  The inconsistencies between the German foreign ministry and Dienststelle Ribbentrop showed themselves again in the course of the negotiations. Dirksen, ambassador in Tokyo, was informed about the ongoing talks not by the German foreign service, but instead by the Japanese General Staff. German foreign minister Konstantin von Neurath, when informed about the situation by Hitler, argued against the creation of a German-Japanese pact. Firstly, he was concerned with Sino-German relations and thought Japan less important to Germany than China, and secondly, he wanted to avoid having foreign policy authority slip away from the foreign ministry towards Dienststelle Ribbentrop, where he saw Ribbentrop as a rival to his own position. In Japan, the matter was stalled, as the important documents got lost between January and February 1936 in the bureaucratic apparatus of the Japanese foreign ministry, as they were discarded by low-ranking officials before reaching foreign minister Kōki Hirota or his deputy Mamoru Shigemitsu. Only in March 1936, following the turmoil in Japan related to the failed military coup of February 26 and the German Remilitarization of the Rhineland did the matter reach the new foreign minister Hachirō Arita, who discussed it with the ambassador to Germany Mushakoji, who was in Japan at that time, and several high-ranking army officials. In that meeting, Chief of Military Affairs Ryoki Machijiri was the only one in favor of an outright military alliance between Germany and Japan, whereas Arita, Shigemitsu, Hisaichi Terauchi and Mushakoji favored the more careful way of an agreement specifically aimed against the Comintern. However, they overestimated their own authority in Berlin, where Ōshima was still the main negotiation partner for the Germans and personally unwilling to give up any of his newfound diplomatic importance to officials of the foreign ministry. To prevent a clash with the Japanese army, of which Ōshima as a military attaché was technically the subordinate of, rather than the foreign ministry, Arita and Mushakoji had to carefully weave a new position. While favoring the Anti-Comintern version of the agreement, they still gave Ōshima as a representative of the military the ability to negotiate a full alliance. Mushakoji was instructed to take a passive stance towards the Germans and let them initiate negotiations, as to not appear as if the Japanese foreign ministry was making a leap forward. On the German side, the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance of 27 March 1936 increased the demand for a strong partner in the Soviet Union's rear to prevent complete encirclement. Furthermore, Hitler hoped that France's allegiance to the Soviet Union might drive the anti-communist British government into a deal with Germany if Germany only made a strong enough gesture against communism. As such, negotiations resumed on 23 October 1936 and the pact was finalized and signed on 25 November of the same year. The treaty between France and the USSR, as well as the increased cooperation between communists and socialists that had resulted from the Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, allowed the communist PCF to double its votes in the 1936 elections in France. With infighting on the political left in Europe reduced, it became more urgent for the German government to reassess its position. However, the German diplomatic ambivalence between the ideological proximity and military potential of Japan and the economic value of China initially continued, and Neurath remained in favor of German alignment with China. In April 1936, Germany signed a major commercial treaty with China and gave them a credit of 100,000,000 marks for China to purchase German industrial and other products. It was Hitler himself who, unbeknownst to Neurath and the foreign ministry, began to reassess the importance of China and Japan in German foreign relations over the course of the summer 1936. Hitler sanctioned new negotiations with the Japanese. Later that year, when German military attaché in Tokyo Eugen Ott temporarily returned to Germany to attend army maneuvers, he expressed his optimism about the Japanese army's willingness to conclude the pact to Hitler. Terauchi in May 1936 informed Ōshima that the army was yielding control of the negotiations to the foreign ministry in order to restore harmony between the two factions, but unofficially, Ōshima remain Japan's key negotiator and Mushakoji's role was more ceremonial. In July, Mushakoji requested a draft of the proposed treaty from Dienststelle Ribbentrop, which was drawn up by one of the Dienststelle's East Asian specialists, Dr. Hermann von Raumer. But instead of taking this draft immediately to Mushakoji, Raumer, who probably acted on Ribbentrop's instructions, first presented it to Ōshima, who was attending the Bayreuth Festival at the time. On 22 July, Ōshima, Ribbentrop, Raumer and Hitler met in Bayreuth, where Hitler made some personal edits to Raumer's draft. Only then was the draft shown to ambassador Mushakoji. = Japanese objections and final adjustments to the agreement = This initial draft signed off on by Hitler appears to be lost to history, as the Japanese ambassador made some changes to it that were intended, according to Shigenori Tōgō's testimony at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, to make it less 'propagandistic' and more 'business-like'. Tōgō, acting on behalf of Arita, who was once again Japanese foreign minister, wanted to scrap all of Hitler's envisioned military provisions. Because Hitler's draft was lost, it is impossible to say what these were, but from the context, it seems likely that they were both a defensive as well as an offensive alliance against the Soviet Union, because Tōgō, when he was unable to have all military provisions scrapped outright, instead made a position where the provisions should be purely defensive, implying that they were offensive as well at some point. On 24 July 1936, the Japanese government after some deliberation formally requested that the Anti-Comintern Pact should be limited only to an intelligence and information exchange as to avoid unnecessary diplomatic complications with the Soviet Union. The Japanese government also specifically requested to avoid any direct alliance and to instead only require consultation in case of attack, even in the secret protocol. Furthermore, the Japanese government requested clarification to make any obligation in case of a war of one the parties against the Soviet Union specifically defensive (to avoid being drawn into a German offensive war against the USSR at an inopportune time), and to avoid specifically naming the Soviet Union in the treaty, even in the secret protocol. The first two requests made their way into the final version of the Anti-Comintern Pact, but the third did not. The Soviet Union's name was only avoided in the public parts of the treaty, and the secret protocol of the finalized Anti-Comintern Pact still specifically referred to the USSR. Additionally, the Japanese government also requested clarification on the prohibition on bilateral treaties with the Soviet Union without former consent, fearing that the wording of the treaty would only affect the present and future and that it would allow Germany to maintain existing bilateral treaties with the USSR, including the Treaty of Rapallo (1922) and the Treaty of Berlin (1926). Specifically the latter treaty, which was a German-Soviet neutrality pact that had been upheld even by the anti- communist Nazis, was viewed in Japan as contradictory to the proposed terms of the Anti-Comintern Pact. The German government viewed the Anti-Comintern Pact as sufficient to overwrite the terms of the Treaty of Berlin, and the Japanese government was satisfied with this explanation as long as it was attached to the treaty's as a secret appendix. The Japanese government in its internal memoranda also stressed the vital necessity to avoid a deterioration of Anglo- Japanese relations as a result of the pact. There was a hope in Japan that the Anti-Comintern Pact could appeal to anti-communist circles in the United Kingdom and mend the two countries' relationship. After the pact's conclusion, this would prove to be a miscalculation. Ōshima, in a final act of insubordination to the foreign ministry, suggested to Hitler that the foreign ministry's objections could be salvaged if the anti-Soviet clauses of the treaty were added to the agreement in secret. Eventually, the foreign ministry yielded to the army's pressure, and agreed to a secret military addendum to the pact. On 16 August 1936, Ribbentrop informed Hitler that negotiations with ambassador Mushakoji and with Ōshima had resulted in the ambassador's declaration that the Japanese government was willing to in principle approve the agreement. In a note to Hitler, Ribbentrop commented on the Japanese government's aversion to and the Japanese army's support for a publication. However, some minor adjustments were still made between August and October, when the pact was formally initialed. Its length was reduced to 5 years, down from 10 as had originally been planned. And, against Ōshima's and Hitler's hopes, the military leadership in Japan insisted that the military provisions could be only defensive and not offensive, even if agreed upon in a secret addendum. The military leadership was concerned that, if Japan was caught in a war against China, an offensive clause to the treaty would diplomatically force Japan into a war against the Soviet Union that it was militarily unwilling to fight. As a result, the first article of the secret additional protocol spoke specifically of \\"unprovoked attack\\" by the Soviet Union and had no offensive precautions. On the other hand, the Japanese side was unable to gain the upper hand on the topic of the pact's publication, which was advocated for by the Germans and which Japan had attempted to avoid. Furthermore, the secret protocol remained explicitly aimed at the Soviet Union, something that the Japanese had felt was an ineffective provision. The treaty draft was finalized on 23 October 1936. = Approval by the Japanese Privy Council and by Adolf Hitler = The Anti-Comintern Pact required the approval of the Privy Council of Japan to allow Japanese accession to the treaty. Prime Minister Hirota had expressed his personal relief upon hearing the treaty draft's conclusion on 23 October 1936, and compared the achievement of the IJA in its advancement of the Anti-Comintern Pact to the IJN's success in forging the 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance. The elder Japanese statesman Saionji Kinmochi, last of the genrō, had disagreed with the Japanese government's diplomatic step and denounced the Anti-Comintern Pact as exclusively useful to Germany and as without benefit for Japan. Kinmochi instead would have preferred a diplomatic course more in line with Japanese public opinion and geography, both of which made a positive relationship with UK and USA desirable. However, Kinmochi's critical stance remained unheard in the Privy Council. In the view of the proponents of the treaty within Japan, spearheaded by the IJA, Japan was militarily threatened by the Soviet Union's meddling in China, just as Germany was threatened by Soviet support for France and Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, both countries feared subversion by communist forces. This, as a result, made Germany and Japan natural allies against the Soviet Union and the Comintern. The opponents, who gathered around the IJN, cited the likelihood that the Anti-Comintern Pact would increase rather than decrease the threat posed by the USSR and that there would be considerable domestic resistance against the agreement. Ultimately, the supporters won out (discussion sessions took place on 13 November and 18 November), and the Privy Council gave the treaty its unanimous support on 25 November 1936. On the German side, all that was required for German accession to the pact was Hitler's approval, which was given quickly, and subsequently supported by a wave of anti-communist propaganda in the state-controlled German press.  Conclusion of the Pact, 1936  The treaty, which outlined a joint German and Japanese policy to counteract the activities of the Communist Internationale, was initially to be in force for five years, until November 1941. Two additional protocols were signed, one of which was public. The other, which was specifically aimed against the Soviet Union, was secret. The treaty was signed in the offices of Dienststelle Ribbentrop rather than the German foreign ministry. Ribbentrop, in his Nuremberg testimony, explained this with Hitler's desire to avoid the usage of official channels of German politics for what Ribbentrop referred to as an \\"ideological question\\" rather than a political one. = Texts of the Anti-Comintern Pact and its protocols =  Main agreement  The full text was considered in its original form in both the German and Japanese versions, and the date was specified in both countries' versions as 25 November 1936 as well as 25 November in the 11th year of the Shōwa period. The agreement bears the signatures of German foreign minister Ribbentrop and Japanese ambassador to Germany Mushakoji. The initial length of the treaty was specified to be five years. This reduced length was one of the concessions made after the objections of the Japanese foreign ministry to the initial Bayreuth draft of the treaty, in which the treaty was at first supposed to have a duration of ten years. In the first article of the treaty, Germany and Japan agreed to share information about Comintern activities and to plan their operations against such activities jointly. In the second article, the two parties opened the possibility of extending the pact to other countries \\"whose domestic peace is endangered by the disruptive activities of the Communist Internationale\\". Such invitations to third parties would be undertaken jointly and after the expressed consent by both parties. German state media referred to this provision of endangerment by Comintern disruption when, among other examples, the Völkischer Beobachter recounted various communist activities in Hungary and Manchukuo as the reason for the two countries to join the pact in February 1939.  Protocol Supplement  A supplementary protocol was signed along with the agreement on the same day, 25 November 1936/Shōwa 11. Just like the main agreement, it bears the signatures of Ribbentrop and Mushakoji. In the first article, German and Japan agreed to have their competent authorities \\"closely co-operate in the exchange of reports on the activities of [...] and on measures of information and defense against\\" the Comintern. The two contracting parties also agreed, in the second article, to have their competent authorities \\"within the framework of the existing law [...] take stringent measures against those who at home or abroad work on direct or indirect duty\\" of the Comintern.  Secret Additional Protocol  In addition to the main treaty and the public additional protocol (\\"Protocol Supplement\\"), there was also another additional protocol on 25 November 1936/Shōwa 11, this one kept in strict secrecy from the public, which specifically dealt with the establishment of Germany's and Japan's military and diplomatic partnership against the Soviet Union. While the Soviet Union was alluded to with the public protocol's references to Comintern activity, the secret additional protocol is the only one where the USSR is actually mentioned by name. Just like the main agreement and the public additional protocol, the secret additional protocol was signed by Ribbentrop and Mushakoji. The latter protocol's secrecy was agreed upon in a separate document signed by both Ribbentrop and Mushakoji, in which the two states created the option to inform third parties about the contents of the secret agreement with mutual consent. Ambassador Mushakoji informed Japanese foreign minister Hachirō Arita of the successful conclusion of negotiations later on in the day. The secret additional protocol reveals the true intention of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Rather than a vague ideological crackdown on the alleged overreach of communist activists, it was a specific defensive alliance direct particularly against the Soviet Union as a country. Due to its covert nature, the secret additional protocol remained exclusive between Germany and Japan, whereas other countries joined only the two public clauses of the treaty. Starting with Italy, the other countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact did not sign the secret additional protocol. = Reactions = To the international community, the Anti-Comintern Pact signalled the beginning of the German-Japanese partnership, as it marked the first formal alliance between the two countries.  China  The Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan was a direct threat to China, which relied on German military assistance against the threat of the imminent Japanese invasion. The German foreign ministry, which had been opposed to Dienststelle Ribbentrop's alignement with Japan, made significant efforts to reassure China of German assistance. This lasted until the outbreak of hostilities between Japan and China in July 1937, after which Germany, keeping with Ribbentrop's agenda, aligned clearly with Japan, including the German compliance with Japanese requests to recall the military mission of Alexander von Falkenhausen.  France  In France, the Anti-Comintern Pact, especially after Italy's entry, was viewed as a German power grab in Eastern Europe, particularly to the detriment of Czechoslovakia and Poland.  Germany  The German public was informed of the treaty's entry into legislation by the German Reichsgesetzblatt of the year 1937.Reichsministerium des Innern (1937). Reichsgesetzblatt 1937 (in German). Reichsverlagsamt. pp. 27–28. (page 27) (page 28) Ribbentrop justified the Anti-Comintern Pact as a joint German- Japanese act to defend western civilization. The existence of the secret additional protocol and the treaty's anti-Soviet nature was denied in Nazi Germany even after the beginning of the German-Soviet War in 1941. The German government launched a pro-Japanese publicity campaign to improve the general opinion of the German public about Japan. This was part of the German government's attempt to forge a tighter cultural relationship.  Italy  The Italian government, which had still viewed Germany as a potential rival well into the year 1935, had initially abstained from the negotiations of the Anti-Comintern Pact. But starting with the 1936 October Protocols, Germany and Italy had begun a diplomatic rapprochement on the backdrop of the Italian war in Ethiopia and the resulting failure of the Italian Stresa Front with the UK and France. Still, Italy was keen to, at least initially, avoid the implication that it would soon adhere to the Anti-Comintern Pact itself, even though Ribbentrop heavily implied that \\"Italy will hoist the anti-Bolshevist banner in the south\\" soon after the pact's creation. Hitler shared that same impression. Italy would end up joining the pact in November 1937.  Japan  The Japanese public as a whole did not receive the Anti-Comintern Pact with any particular enthusiasm. In the aftermath of the agreement, the influx of national socialist ideology into Japanese society after the alignment with Germany caused an increase in antisemitism in Japan. The Japanese press, less restricted than its German counterpart, was even partially critical of the pact's apparently sudden and rushed conclusion (the negotiations had been kept in strict secrecy from the public until the pact's publication), and there were doubts in the newspapers' opinion pieces about the willingness of Germany to sacrifice its soldiers in the case of a war between Japan and the Soviet Union. In Tokyo, the government was reluctant to attract any unwanted international antagonists while focussed on its aims in mainland China. As such, the government had been initially cautious to cause a diplomatic incident with the Soviet Union, United Kingdom and United States, but eventually saw itself driven into the treaty when the Soviet Union signed a mutual assistance treaty with the Mongolian People's Republic in April 1936. However, despite the government's scepticism, the Privy Council had given its unanimous consent. As a result of the Anti-Comintern Pact, the military influence within the government was strengthened. The Japanese government, in response to the upsurge of antisemitism that resulted from the influx of European-style national socialist ideology into Japanese society, began using antisemitic imagery in its media campaigns, particularly those directed against western-style capitalism. Prime Minister Hirota called Germany Japan's foremost diplomatic partner after the treaty, but stressed that the Anti- Comintern Pact did not imply ideological support for Germany's domestic policy. The IJA, which traditionally was an admirer and imitator of German military systems that employed hundreds of German military experts and advisors by the 1920s, and sent Japanese army hopefuls to Germany for study, was the treaty's main proponent. Prince Kotohito had signalled the army's positive predisposition towards Ōshima's efforts in Berlin. The IJA was closely aligned with its German counterpart and a strong proponent of a joint Japanese-German action against the Soviet Union. The IJN, by contrast, was among the treaty's greatest critics. While the IJN officer class wasn't necessarily denouncing the pact, its usefulness was seen as very limited. The IJN view of the naval situation was one where Japan had an inferior naval force to that of the United Kingdom and United States, both of whom were furthermore inclined to cooperate with each other to counteract the Japanese presence if necessary. By contrast, Germany (and later Italy) would be of almost no help to alleviate an Anglo-American naval blockade or aid the Japanese naval efforts in the Pacific. The Japanese navy would have preferred to avoid the treaty if that meant a better relationship with the United States and United Kingdom as a result.  Soviet Union  To the Soviet Union specifically, the Anti-Comintern Pact was seen internally as a clear sign of an attempted encirclement by Germany and Japan. In a political note to the Hungarian government in January 1939, Soviet foreign minister Maxim Litvinov called the Anti-Comintern Pact a 'political instrument mainly in the hands of the Japanese, who had hostile intentions against the Soviet Union'. Litvinov had also commented in the immediate aftermath of the treaty's conclusion, speaking to the All-Union Congress of Soviets on 26 November, casting doubt on the completeness of the treaty as presented to the public, declaring it to be \\"only a camouflage for another agreement which was simultaneously discussed\\". Publicly, the Soviet government attempted to downplay the significance of the pact. Soviet diplomats were quickly of the same opinion that had been implied by Litvinov on 26 November: The Anti-Comintern Pact was specifically directed against the USSR. Soviet ambassador in Tokyo Konstantin Yurenev believed (correctly) that the pact, behind its facade, contained military provisions against the Soviet Union. Yurenev had even before the pact's publication contacted Japanese foreign minister Arita on 16 November and 20 November. While Arita had on the first request dodged the issue by pointing to the fact that the negotiations was only directed against the Comintern and not the Soviet Union, he did not respond to the latter contact by Yurenev, in which the ambassador accused the Japanese foreign service of holding secret negotiations with Germany specifically aimed against the USSR. The Anti- Comintern Pact politically accelerated the downward trend of the Soviet Union's trade relations with Japan. In 1939, Japanese imports from European Russia were the lowest since 1914 and exports to European Russia the lowest since 1926, whereas Japanese imports from Asiatic Russia were the lowest since 1887 and exports to Asiatic Russia the lowest since 1914. Alarmed by the Anti- Comintern Pact, the USSR had cut down sales to and purchases from Japan. The Anti-Comintern Pact's restrictive policy towards bilateral treaties between Japan and the USSR without German consent made this downward spiral hard to fix. Only after the German-Soviet Pact of 1939 and the subsequent decrease of Japanese trust in Germany did the mutual political and economic attitude improve.  United Kingdom  The United Kingdom also saw its colonial empire in Asia and eventually Africa threatened by the Japanese and later also the Italian allegiance with Germany. This view was not completely unjustified in the context of the Axis Powers' navies, as the naval high commands of Germany, Italy and Japan mainly aimed their common considerations against the United Kingdom, not the Soviet Union. In the House of Commons, the Anti- Comintern Pact became a subject of debate multiple times. The British armed forces were concerned about a potential military conflict with Germany and Japan, and this feeling was escalated upon Italian accession to the agreement.  United States  In the United States, the German-Japanese agreement was viewed as an indication that Germany might follow Japan's path of satisfying territorial claims with military action, like Japan had done in Manchuria in 1931. In a September 1937 report to the Treasury (after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War), it was argued that the long-term consequence of a Japanese victory in China would result in other 'dissatisfied' powers, like Germany and Italy, seeking the fulfillment of their objectives in military endeavors of their own. The American armed forces were concerned about the prospect of Japan gaining military allies in the form of Germany and later Italy, as that posed a potential threat to the American War Plan Orange. In 1937, American ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew analyzed the Anti-Comintern Pact's anti-communist rhetoric as a mere banner for 'have- not' countries to unite under while in truth aiming primarily against the British Empire's global dominance. Franklin D. Roosevelt, U.S. President 1933–1945, shared French concerns about the safety of Poland and Czechoslovakia. Roosevelt believed that the pact contained secret clauses outlining an alliance that was both defensive and offensive, and that it divided the world into spheres of influence for each of the signatories. Eventually, the USS Panay incident of 1937 resulted in the President's course to attempt to break the Anti-Comintern Pact by appeasing Germany and Italy with the goal of isolating Japan from its allies to hinder its progress in China. Cordell Hull noted in his memoirs that \\"[n]othing could have been more logical and natural than an alliance of Berlin and Tokyo\\", citing shared values of militarism, conquest and disregard for international treaties as the reason for his conclusion.  History of the Anti-Comintern Pact until World War II, 1936–1939  = German and Japanese ideas on expansion of the Anti- Comintern Pact = The Anti-Comintern Pact's original provisions had included a specific provision that allowed Germany and Japan to jointly invite additional members into the pact. In Japan, the Anti-Comintern Pact was seen as possibly groundbreaking in freeing the country from its international isolation and to acquire new diplomatic and military partners. Countries whose membership Japan was interested in included the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and especially Poland. = War in China, July 1937 = The Anti- Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan met its first trial when the hostilities between Japan and China, both of whom were important partners to Germany, went to war. The Second Sino-Japanese War, provoked by the Japanese forces through the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, forced Germany to reassess the balance of its economic relationship with China and its ideological and military alignment with Japan. It was evident that Germany would have to abandon one of its partners in favor of the other, and made the decision to favor Japan over China, although Hitler himself had as late as 1936 personally still assured the Chinese ambassador that Germany would maintain the two countries' important relationship. While Germany's policy in regards to the war between Japan and China was one of strict neutrality, it made no particular effort, diplomatic or otherwise, to stop the Japanese aggression against China. The German government and foreign service still remained privately critical of the Japanese course of action. When Japanese ambassador to Germany Mushakoji explained to state secretary Ernst von Weizsäcker that the Japanese invasion of China kept in the spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact in its attempt to vanquish Chinese communism, Weizsäcker dismissed Mushakoji's explanation on the basis of the German view that the Japanese action would foster rather than stifle the growth of communism in China. Weizsäcker, in his notes with regards to this conversation with Mushakoji, expressed the fear that the Japanese aggression could lead directly to an alliance between the Soviet Union and China. = Entry of Italy, 6 November 1937 = On 6 November 1937, Italy joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. Italy's decision was a reaction to the failure of the Stresa Front, the Franco-British initiative of 1935 designed to keep Germany from extending beyond its present borders that involved Italian cooperation. In particular, both nations tried to block \\"German expansionism\\", especially the annexation of Austria, which the fascist government in Rome also wanted to prevent at that time. Distrustful relations and Benito Mussolini's own expansionism furthered the distance between Italy and the two Allied Powers. Italy invaded Ethiopia in October 1935, in an act of unprovoked aggression that was a breach of the League of Nations policy. Although the attempted Hoare–Laval Pact, designed by its British and French drafters to allow Italy to retain most of its war goals and to maintain the Stresa Front, had failed to gain support, the League of Nations had discredited itself. After the league eventually punished Italian expansionism with economic sanctions, this broke the Stresa Front and resulted in the necessity for Italy to search for a new partner. As a result, Italy was diplomatically driven away from the Stresa Front with the Allies and towards the Pact of Steel with Germany. Italy's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact completed the diplomatic triangle between Germany, Italy and Japan later formalized in the Tripartite Pact that was colloquially known as the Axis Powers, inspired by the term used by Benito Mussolini in reference to the German-Italian relationship on 1 November 1936. Italy's accession into the pact was a trade-off, in which Mussolini agreed to Hitler's goals of Austrian annexation. Italy had been invited to the pact as early as the original German-Japanese agreement in November 1936, but was at the time disinterested in the largely symbolic gesture, as the Italian government believed that its anti-communist attitude was sufficiently represented by the Italian presence in the Spanish Civil War. Italian membership had been considered by Ribbentrop during the earliest drafting stages of the agreement in October 1935. German- Italian rapprochement didn't fully begin until October 1936, when the Anti- Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan was already nearing its enactment. Galeazzo Ciano, Italy's foreign minister, was apprehensive about the potential loss of influence for Italy in South East Europe that a close alignment with Germany and the subsequent German entry into the Balkans would entail. The Italian stance towards a Third Europe or Horizontal Axis, the idea of a power bloc in Eastern Europe that rejected both German and Soviet influence, was not necessarily negative. It was this ambivalence in Italian foreign policy that initially hindered a full Italian alignment with Germany. By 1937, the Italian interest in the pact had changed, as the Mussolini administration desired to have its own military alliance with Japan and felt that accession to the agreement would be the easiest way to forge the triangular alliance with Germany and Japan that the Italian government desired. Ciano commented in his diary on 2 November 1937 that the pact, while anti-communist in name, was instead 'clearly anti-British'. The protocol of Italy's entry was signed on 6 November 1937. It should be pointed out that, as a result of the phrasing of the treaty, Italy was, from a purely legal argument, required to only adhere to the main text and the public supplementary protocol, but not to the secret protocol that had the specific military directives against the Soviet Union. In reaction to the Italian accession to the pact, the British government saw the traditional British dominance in the Mediterranean (Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Egypt (Suez Canal)) threatened by a potentially resurgent Italy backed with German industrial and military power. Robert Vansittart, a prominent critic of the British Appeasement policy under Neville Chamberlain, warned that Italy, with its recent acquisitions in the war against Ethiopia, threatened a pincer movement against Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and that Mussolini, due to his personality, could not be deterred even by Italy's economic instability from a potential military adventure against the United Kingdom. = Attempts to develop the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance, 1936–1939 = After the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact and especially after Italy's entry, Ribbentrop continued his efforts to form it into a full military alliance. This mirrored the thoughts of Ribbentrop, Raumer, Ōshima and Hitler during the treaty's creation, as the original draft that Hitler signed off on in Bayreuth had likely included military terms that were explicitly both defensive as well as offensive. This was prevented by the intervention of Japanese diplomats around Shigenori Tōgō. After the pact's conclusion, Ribbentrop's efforts to transform it into a military alliance continued, although his agenda was driven by the concern of war against the western allies, whereas Hitler's main primary concern had been to eliminate the Soviet Union. Ribbentrop in his function as German ambassador to the United Kingdom recommended to Hitler in his report of 28 December 1937 and his final conclusions of 2 January 1938 the creation of a strong anti-British alliance with the ability to threaten the United Kingdom in a way that would either compel it to stay neutral or in the case of war be able to defeat it. Ribbentrop's political power within the German foreign service grew massively when he was named foreign minister as a replacement for Konstantin von Neurath on 4 February 1938. This was part of the reshuffle of army, air force and foreign service caused by the dismissal of Werner von Blomberg and Werner von Fritsch. In this military-political purge, Hitler removed twelve generals (not counting Blomberg and Fritsch) and reassigned 51 other military posts. The removal of Neurath, Fritsch and Blomberg marked the elimination of large parts of the 'moderate' faction in the cabinet Hitler, where as the 'extremists' remained: Goebbels, Hess, Rosenberg and Ribbentrop. The May Crisis of 1938, when there was a perception of aggressive German troop movements against Czechoslovakia, brought with it strong diplomatic reactions from France and Britain that went contrary to the established Appeasement policy. As a result, Ribbentrop renewed his pressure on Hitler to formalize the Anti-Comintern Pact into a full military alliance for the case of war against the United Kingdom and France. He eventually also gained the support of Bernardo Attolico, Italian ambassador to Germany, for the idea. In early January 1939, Ribbentrop was certain of his progress in transforming the pact into an alliance. Mussolini, who had by now given up his attempts at Italian diplomatic ambivalence between the United Kingdom and Germany and fully committed to Italian allegiance with Germany, gave his agreement as well. Mussolini also advocated to even expand this prospective alliance to include Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania. Signing of the Pact of Steel by Galeazzo Ciano for Italy and Joachim von Ribbentrop for Germany Henceforth, from January 1939 onward, Italy and Germany cooperated on their draft of a military alliance, but Japan was cautious to commit. While the political lobby of the Japanese army was generally in favor of the conclusion of a military alliance with Germany, particularly under the aspect of a containment of the Soviet Union, the Japanese navy continued to view the prospect of an alliance with Germany as of no particular use for Japan's naval strategic position and as a potential diplomatic and economic blunder, as Japan's navy alone would not be sufficient to hold off British and American naval forces if an alliance with Germany would lead Japan into war with either of the Anglo-American powers, thus cutting Japan, dependent on off vital shipping routes. The overall Japanese attitude, still anti-Soviet rather than anti-British, did not fit with the German and Italian designs to openly antagonize the United Kingdom. The Japanese foreign service did not wish to be drawn into a war between the nations of Western Europe and as a result aimed to differentiate between the Axis Powers' designs against the UK and those against the USSR. Ribbentrop's designs were thus rejected by the Japanese delegates, who insisted on the Anti-Comintern Pact's initial anti-communist designs and were unwilling to see an anti-British component added to it. Eventually, Japanese caution led Ribbentrop to settle for only a bilateral alliance rather than the trilateral one he had hoped for, and the Pact of Steel was signed between Germany and Italy on 22 May 1939. The Pact of Steel's capabilities were commented on by Ciano as \\"real dynamite\\". The Pact of Steel enabled Germany to proceed in its aggressive posturing against Poland, as this issue did not necessarily require Japanese consent or support, but Ribbentrop also desired to expand the Pact of Steel and include Japan in it. However, Japanese stalling tactics continued, and Germany wanted to eliminate the Soviet Union as a potential factor in its war against Poland. As a result, Ribbentrop started seriously pondering a quid pro quo with the USSR in the question of Eastern Europe's future. This would mark a complete betrayal of the Anti-Comintern Pact's provision to not make bilateral treaties with the Soviet Union without Japanese consent, but Germany proceeded nonetheless. In May 1939, Ribbentrop instructed Friedrich-Werner Graf von der Schulenburg to initiate a German-Soviet rapprochement on the basis that the newly forged Pact of Steel marked a turn in Germany's foreign policy, away from anti-Soviet towards anti-British and anti-French diplomacy. Ribbentrop also promised to redirect Japanese anti-Soviet foreign policy into a state where Japan and the USSR would no longer have to stand in rivalry. At this stage, Ribbentrop also started envisioning a bloc of four, where the Soviet Union would be included with Germany, Italy and Japan to form a quadripartite faction against British influence. This marked a complete deviation from Nazi policy, particularly the Hitlerian goal of Lebensraum, and was one of the many iterations of Ribbentrop's all-encompassing foreign political goal of containing by all possible means the influence of the United Kingdom. This Euro-Asiatic bloc of four, as historian Wolfgang Michalka calls it, ultimately failed because of the differences between Germany, the Soviet Union and Japan. Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. = Entry of Hungary and Manchukuo, 24 February 1939 = Hungary joined the agreement on 24 February 1939. It received the invitation to the pact on 13 January, after the Hungarian foreign minister István Csáky announced on 12 January that Hungary would accept an invitation if it were to receive one. It was the first member with some independence outside of the big three, and it was subsequently the first country to be denied first-class status among the pact's members, thus establishing the division between Germany, Italy and Japan as the leading nations of the pact and the remaining countries as their subordinates. This superior status of the three leading countries was later formalized in the extension of the pact on 25 November 1941. The pact proved unpopular in Hungary, particularly as Hungary's long- standing ally Poland became Germany's target. In his memoirs, Hungary's strongman Miklós Horthy would later complain that Germany had unduly involved itself in Hungarian domestic affairs even before Hungary's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact, and that German media had no place to insist that Hungary had a 'bill to pay' after profiting from German diplomatic intervention on her behalf during the First Vienna Award. However, the German archives show that a clear quid pro quo had been made between Germany and Hungary: In exchange for the German support of Hungarian territorial expansion into southern Slovakia and Carpatho-Ukraine, Hungarian Prime Minister Kálmán Darányi specifically promised Hungary would leave the League of Nations and join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Another country that joined the pact on 24 February 1939 was the Japanese-established Empire of Manchukuo. Manchukuo received the invitation on 16 January and the accession protocol was signed in Changchun on 24 February. The entry of Hungary and Manchukuo was celebrated by the German state- controlled Völkischer Beobachter as the growth of the front against bolshevism and the consolidation of a world order. = Entry of Spain, 27 March 1939 = Francisco Franco's Spain joined the pact on 27 March 1939, the same day that the surrender of the Spanish Republicans at the end the Siege of Madrid brings the end of the Spanish Civil War. The accelerated addition of Spain to the Anti-Comintern Pact, with the goal to counteract British influence in Spain, had been pursued by German, Italian and Japanese politicians since at least January 1939. It was specified by German State Secretary Weizsäcker that the invitation to Spain should only come from Germany, Italy, and Japan, but not from Hungary. The Spanish side delayed the accession into the pact, as the Franco leadership feared intervention by the Allied powers on the Republican side should the Nationalists side with the Axis before the war's conclusion. Franco's foreign minister, Jordana, accordingly stalled Spain's entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Spain's membership in the pact was proof of Spanish alignment with the European fascists, and the nationalist success in the Spanish Civil War became a justification for the Anti-Comintern Pact's continued activity and as a confirmation of the pact's value. In the British House of Commons, Spain's entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact was viewed with suspicion, particularly in regards to the safety of Gibraltar and by extension Malta, British Egypt and Mandatory Palestine. The British government, after nationalist victory had become obvious, had attempted to quickly improve relations with the new government in Madrid, but the progress on Anglo-Spanish relations received a setback with the Spanish entry into the pact. France, although nominally also interested in positive relations with the falangists as seen in the Bérard-Jordana Agreement of 25 February 1939, made even less headway than the British. After Spanish entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact, there was a Spanish military buildup in colonial Morocco, and the Franco government further worsened tensions by refusing to allow the re-entry of refugees that had fled the country in the closing days of the Spanish Civil War. = Other considerations, 1938–1939 = A candidate for membership in the eyes of the Axis Powers was the Second Polish Republic. Poland had cooperated with Germany on the occupations of Czechoslovak territory after the Munich Agreement and seemed like an approachable partner, but the German offers of a Polish membership in the pact were tied to a return of Danzig to Germany, something that Poland was unwilling to accept out of concern for its access to the sea and its policy of equal diplomatic distance between Germany and the Soviet Union. In January 1939, the Axis Powers were courting the Stojadinović government in Yugoslavia to attempt to induce Yugoslavia to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. The attempts failed when Stojadinović's government fell on 5 February 1939 and Stojadinović was replaced with Dragiša Cvetković as Prime Minister, which came as a surprise to the Axis Powers, who had believed Stojadinović was secure in office. While there were hopes among the Axis that Stojadinović might return to power, this failed to materialize. In February 1939, the German military leadership, independent from the foreign ministry, increased the pressure on Bulgaria to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Generalmajor Georg Thomas explained to the Bulgarian delegation during negotiations regarding German armament loans to Bulgaria that such loans could only be extended if Bulgaria made a clear political showing of alignment to Germany in form of joining the Anti- Comintern Pact. Weizsäcker complained to the Wehrmacht high command about this incident. Thomas subsequently claimed to Weizsäcker that he was acting on the direct orders of Hermann Göring. In a subsequent conversation between the Bulgarian delegate and Weizsäcker, it was made clear that Bulgaria was not in the situation to join the Anti-Comintern Pact at that time. Bulgaria wouldn't join the agreement until 25 November 1941. In the run up to the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in the rump territories of Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovak accession into the Anti-Comintern Pact was part of the numerous demands Hitler made towards the Czechs as a means to justify the invasion after the inevitable non-compliance. = The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the USSR, August 1939 = The pact's legitimacy was undermined when Germany blatantly broke it by secretly negotiating the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with the Soviet Union. During the negotiations between Ribbentrop and Stalin in Moscow in August 1939, just a few weeks before the outbreak of World War II, the Anti-Comintern Pact proved only a small obstacle. Ribbentrop explained to Stalin that, in fact, the Anti-Comintern Pact had been aimed against the western democracies, not the Soviet Union. Stalin accepted this for the sake of his country's diplomatic goals, and there were jokes made among the German public that the Soviet Union would end up joining the Anti-Comintern Pact itself. Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov had not made the Anti-Comintern Pact an issue during the negotiations with Ribbentrop and German ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg. = Reactions to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact within the Anti-Comintern Pact =  Italy  On the backdrop of the preparations for World War II, the Italian reaction to Germany's actions was ambivalent. The Italian population's pre-existing anti-German and anti-war sentiments weren't helped at all by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, but Mussolini's personal opinion was more divided. Mussolini, although sometimes of the opinion that neutrality was preferable, felt compelled by personal loyalty, fear of Hitler's disapproval, as well as the prospect of easy war spoils that Italy should stand by Germany's side, especially if an Allied act of appeasement in Poland could result in a swift Italian victory in Yugoslavia. Italian involvement in the war was opposed by an anti-war faction in the Italian government around Ciano, who attempted to prevent Italy's entry into World War II and to break the alliance between Germany and Italy, to which Mussolini at times carefully agreed if a long enough time frame was given to dissolve the alliance. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact confirmed numerous suspicions that the Italian public, already unenthusiastic about any diplomatic alliance with Germany, had about the Germans. This diplomatic betrayal, combined with the eventual defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II, fuelled widespread germanophobia in Italian literature and popular culture in the immediate aftermath of World War II.  Japan  In the Japanese view, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a violation of the Anti-Comintern Pact, as Germany had not revealed its negotiations with the USSR to Japan. Subsequently, the Japanese sought to settle the Soviet-Japanese Border War and abandoned any territorial aspirations against the Soviet Union. Japan had mainly intended the Anti- Comintern Pact to be directed against the Soviet Union rather than the United Kingdom, whereas the Molotov-Ribbentrop made it clear that the Germans, at least in 1939, were willing to aid the Soviets to the detriment of the western democracies. In response to this drastic German change in foreign policy and the Japanese defeat at Soviet hands in the border conflicts, the Hiranuma administration resigned. Japanese emperor Hirohito instructed the subsequent government, led by Nobuyuki Abe, to be more cooperative towards the United Kingdom and the United States. Ribbentrop attempted to win Japanese support for his bloc of four with Germany, Italy, Japan and the Soviet Union. The German foreign minister argued that if Tokyo and Moscow were to form a military coalition together with Berlin and Rome, Japan would be free to turn its attention to the potential acquisition of European colonies in South East Asia. However, the ideological barriers were too great for comfort for the Japanese leadership, and Ribbentrop failed to compel them into an alliance with the Soviet Union. He had also put himself forward as a negotiator between Japan and the USSR, but was once again cold-shouldered by both as they began to pragmatically wrap up their differences bilaterally and without German oversight. As a result of the diplomatic shakeup, Japan retreated out of Ribbentrop's anti-British designs. Ribbentrop's pro-Japanese diplomacy, which he had pursued in spite of the German foreign ministry's initial favorability towards China since 1934, was now met with the largest diplomatic distance between Germany and Japan since the Nazis' rise to power. In the aftermath of the Japanese change of attitude towards a war against the Soviet Union, Soviet-Japanese economic relations improved. Shikao Matsumisha of the Commercial Affairs Bureau of the Foreign Office and Soviet foreign minister Molotov signalled mutual interest in an improve of Japanese-Soviet trade relations in October 1939. The two countries agreed to more permanently settle the ongoing question of Japanese fishing in Soviet waters and the payments for the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manchukuo. The Soviet Union promised that significant amounts of the money received as part of these deals would be invested back into the purchase of Japanese goods. The Japanese intelligence agencies and foreign service, which had previously supported separatism among the Soviet Union's ethnic minorities, also restricted their activities in this field as a result of the Soviet-Japanese rapprochement. Starting with the German-Soviet War, the Japanese loss of interest in war with the USSR had the consequence that Japan was unwilling to open up a second front against the Soviet Union to relieve German efforts, as Japan interpreted Germany's aggression as an insufficient reason to trigger the treaty. As a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, there was a significant cooling of German-Japanese relations between late 1939 and the summer of 1940, but after Germany's victories in 1940, the elimination of the French and Dutch colonial powers caused Japan, interested in the acquisition of the colonies in questions, to approach Germany again.  The Anti-Comintern Pact during World War II, 1939–1945  All further additions to the Anti-Comintern Pact were after 1 September 1939 and thus during World War II. The supposed purpose of the pact, as a defensive coalition against communism to counteract the potential of Soviet aggression, became outdated when most of its European member states became engaged in the German-Soviet War. = The effect of the German military victories in the Westfeldzug, early 1940 = In March 1940, Joachim von Ribbentrop once again set about mobilizing Italy, the Soviet Union and especially Japan for his vision of a four-power coalition against the British Empire. In June 1940, the overwhelming German victories in the Westfeldzug saw the defeat of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. With French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies now effectively defenseless, the Tokyo government now felt enticed to once again diplomatically approach Germany, which it had previously distanced itself from after the German quid pro quo with the USSR. The Germans had also won some support with the Japanese ambassadors in Berlin and Rome, Hiroshi Ōshima and Toshio Shiratori, who were swayed by Germany's successes in the Polish campaign and started supporting Ribbentrop's diplomatic agenda. Japanese advance to Lạng Sơn in French Indochina in 1940 Japan, concerned that Germany might actually take the side of France and the Netherlands, possibly then reshaped to be German vassal states, in the colonial question, sought to assure Germany's support for a Japanese annexation of French and Dutch colonies in South East Asia. Ribbentrop was indeed willing to support such Japanese annexations, which had been part of his initial idea regarding the four-power pact's advantages from the Japanese perspective. He painted Japanese acquisitions in East Asia as preparations for a world order where all of Afro-Eurasia would be divided between Germany, Italy, Japan and the Soviet Union. Again, Ribbentrop thus tried to realize his vision of a four-power coalition directed against the United Kingdom. With France eliminated and the Battle of Britain going in British favor, it became more and more clear that the United Kingdom, although on the backfoot, would neither seek a truce nor be knocked out by German invasion. As a result, the role of the still neutral United States and the American support for the UK became more and more important for the conduct of Germany's war effort. Ribbentrop still deluded himself that cooperation with the Soviet Union could be permanent or at least last until the war with the United Kingdom had concluded. This opinion was not shared by Adolf Hitler, who still viewed the 'Jewish-Bolshevist' Soviet Union as Germany's inevitable final enemy. = Replacement of the Anti-Comintern Pact with the Tripartite Pact as the main document of the Axis Powers, 27 September 1940 = After the Molotov- Ribbentrop Pact, with which Germany had blatantly broken the Anti-Comintern Pact, it became necessary to put the Axis Powers' diplomatic connection on a new footing. This came to pass as part of the Tripartite Pact of 27 September 1940. However, the Japanese distrust in the German partner remained, and Japan avoided entanglement in Germany's eventual war against the Soviet Union to fully focus on its own struggle in China. In the Tripartite Pact, the Germans and Italians recognized the Japanese leadership in East Asia, and Japan conversely recognized German and Italian leadership in Europe. The new main target, which had been the Soviet Union in the Anti-Comintern Pact, was now the United States, whose entry into the war both Germany and Japan were keen to avoid. = Extension of the pact, November 1941 = The Anti-Comintern Pact was scheduled to be renewed on 25 November 1941, as its five-year lifespan since 25 November 1936 was about to run out. By this point however, the Tripartite Pact had replaced the Anti-Comintern Pact as the central document of the Axis Powers' allegiance to one another, and as such, membership in the Anti-Comintern Pact was little more than a formality. One of Germany's primary aims was to keep Japan close and to encourage Japan to intervene in the German-Soviet War on Germany's side, but Japan refused to do so for the rest of the war. The Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact, signed in April 1941, would hold up until August 1945, when the Soviet Union violated the pact and invaded Japanese Manchuria. The convention of the various signatories between 24 and 25 November 1941 in Berlin that led to the renewal of the pact was described by Ciano in his diaries as affirmation of the Germans as \\"masters of the house\\" within the Axis Powers. Attendants included Galeazzo Ciano of Italy, Serrano Suñer of Spain, László Bárdossy of Hungary and Mihai Antonescu of Romania, among others. The extension protocol was signed on 25 November 1941 and bears the signatures of representatives of the six previous signatories: Ribbentrop (Germany), Ōshima (Japan), Ciano (Italy), Bárdossy (Hungary), Lü Yiwen (Manchukuo), and Suñer (Spain). The previous signatories rejoined the pact.   In addition, several new countries joined the Anti-Comintern Pact that had not done so before 25 November 1941. Jingwei China submitted its signature ahead of time on 22 November 1941, the other countries submitted theirs on the day of signing, the 25th.  * *22px Nanjing China * * The reaction to the extension in the German state-controlled press, unlike with the previous protocol, was very cold towards Japan and instead emphasized the sacrifices and successes of the European Axis against the Soviet Union in the German-Soviet War. This would not majorly change until 7 December 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.  Bulgaria  Bulgaria had been a country that was stuck between its own expansionist ambitions in the Balkans for which it relied on Italian and German military assistance and diplomatic support, while also trying to avoid major entanglement in Axis operations. Its leader Boris III, hailed as a \\"liberator czar\\" and a unifier of lost Bulgarian territories, could only achieve this status due to the military support of the Axis armies, but was intent in 1941 to avoid Bulgarian involvement in the German-Soviet War on the Eastern Front. This was successful and Bulgarian troops did not participate in Operation Barbarossa, but the permanence of Bulgaria's territorial claims remained completely at the mercy of the Axis Powers, as especially Germany was hesitant to view any territorial settlement in the Balkans after the Axis victories over Greece and Yugoslavia as final. As a result, Bulgaria was forced to please the German partner as much as possible while avoiding the final step of open hostilities against the Soviet Union. As part of this pro-German kowtow, Bulgaria was essentially forced into membership in the Anti-Comintern Pact in November 1941. Soon after, on 13 December, the country declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States. Bulgaria tried to maintain neutrality towards the Soviet Union until the end, but after Romania switched sides in favor of the Allies and allowed the Red Army to pass through Romanian territory to invade Bulgaria, the 1944 Bulgarian coup d'état paved the way to the People's Republic of Bulgaria. Tsar Simeon II's regents were executed.  Croatia  Croatia, Germany's most important partner on the Balkans during the anti-partisan campaigns, had been created in 1941 following the German occupation of Yugoslavia. It joined the Anti-Comintern Pact in November 1941. Such an accession was done with the goal to legitimize the Croatian state and make it look more independent, but also to take a clear stand against the Soviet Union.  Denmark  Denmark had along with Norway been occupied by Germany in the wake of Operation Weserübung that started on 9 April 1940. The government in Copenhagen in immediate response to the German assault decided to have the Danish army stand down and to accept what was framed by Germany as protective occupation. The Danish decision was vastly different from the Norwegian one, as the government in Oslo chose to fight rather than to surrender, and as a result, the German occupation of Denmark was among the lightest of any of the German occupations in Europe. Still, any notion of Danish independence was merely a sham for the purpose of foreign propaganda, and the German authorities watched their Danish counterparts closely. While there was a considerable spectrum of sympathy for the German cause among the Danish public, most Danish civilians resented their occupiers and the German military authorities doubted Danish compliance and loyalty. German attempts to improve public opinion in Denmark, through measures like the establishment of the Danish-German Society with Peter Knutzen as chairman were unsuccessful. The Danish government requested four key exemptions specific to Denmark. * Denmark takes up no military obligations. * Anti-communist action in Denmark should be limited to police operations. * The treaty should be limited to Danish territory. * Denmark will remain neutral in World War II. The Germans, somewhat unhappy with these requests, moved them into a secret addendum as a compromise, making Denmark appear as a full member of the pact from the outside. This damaged the international reputation of the Danish civilian government.  Finland  In Finland, the status of the country during the Second World War remains controversial into the modern day. Whether or not Finland was a full member of the Axis Powers or was just in a state of co-belligerence (, ) with Germany in the shared Finnish-German struggle against the Soviet Union. Finnish entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact on 25 November 1941 is one of the arguments in favor of a full participation of Finland in the Axis Powers.  Nanjing China  The \\"Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China,\\" also referred to as \\"China-Nanjing\\" or the Wang Jingwei regime, a Japanese puppet state established in Nanjing by the defected Nationalist Party politician Wang Jingwei in March 1940, joined the Anti-Comintern Pact on 25 November 1941. It had submitted its signature to the treaty ahead of time, on 22 November.  Romania  Romania was Germany's most militarily important partner in the war against the Soviet Union, but its German partners had done little to actively earn that loyalty. Germany had in quick succession overseen three territorial losses in Romania, when it first awarded the Bessarabia region to the Soviet Union in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, then granted large parts of the Transylvania region to Hungary as part of the Second Vienna Award, and finally approved of Bulgarian territorial gains in the Dobruja region as part of the Treaty of Craiova. Romania, under the leadership of the fascist Iron Guard, thus had its main enemies not only in the Soviet Union, but also among the ranks of the Axis Powers, especially in the form of Hungary. Still, the Iron Guard, which had before the territorial losses advocated a pro-German position, now viewed alignment with Germany as the only way to avoid a further German intervention against Romania and in favor of Hungary. The Romanian participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact on 25 November 1941 thus arose out of the necessity to please the German partner and to further the Romanian campaign against the Soviet Union, to hopefully regain Bessarabia and make territorial acquisitions in Soviet Ukraine.  Slovakia  Slovakia, established in 1939 after the German-instigated dissolution of Czechoslovakia, joined the Anti-Comintern Pact on 25 November 1941. = 1942–1945 = As part of the German occupation of Norway and Norway's collaborationist Quisling regime, the accession of Quisling Norway into the Anti-Comintern Pact was discussed, most notably in the German Memorandum über die Neuordnung in Norwegen, the 'memorandum regarding the reorganization of Norway', issued in Oslo on 10 February 1942.  List of suggested memberships, 1935–1945  Between 1936 and 1945, the Axis Powers used the Anti-Comintern Pact as a diplomatic tool to increase their political and diplomatic leverage, but were sometimes unsuccessful. * 's entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact was considered by the Germans as part of the efforts to involve the South American ABC-Staaten ('ABC States', Argentina, Brazil, Chile) in the pact. * **Brazil's entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact was considered by the Germans as part of the efforts to involve the South American ABC-Staaten in the pact. **The Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas had established the new November 1937 constitution of the Estado Novo under the pretext of communist insurgency, and Brazil was thus considered the prime entry point for the Anti-Comintern Pact in South America. The Brazilian government promised that its domestic anti- communist conviction would continue, but declined entry into the Anti- Comintern Pact on the basis that it didn't look to diplomatically offend the United Kingdom or the United States. However, Brazilian minister showed interest in German help for a Brazilian Anti-Comintern Exhibition similar to the ones that had already been held in Germany. *'s entry into the Anti- Comintern Pact was considered by the Germans as part of the efforts to involve the South American ABC-Staaten in the pact. * **China was part of the 1935 vision for the Anti-Comintern Pact by Ribbentrop, and had been courted by both Germany and Japan to join the Anti-Comintern Pact as early as 1936. **By late 1935, Wang Jingwei was in favor of joining the pact, but Chiang Kai-shek was careful to offend the Soviet Union, who was China's only potential partner in case of a Japanese attack. **After serious considerations, the Kai-shek administration refused. They were unwilling to align with Japan without a retreat of Japanese forces from China. Such a retreat was rejected by Japan, which meant that China was unwilling to offend the Soviet Union, the only major power that would be able to effectively aid them in the case of a war against Japan. This war became reality in the following year. **On 3 November 1938, Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe in a public broadcast offered peace terms that included Chinese accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact. **Between December 1939 and March 1940, preliminary peace talks were carried out under the Japanese Kiri Project. The drafted terms involved Chinese accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact. The Chinese government stalled for time and did not give a definitive answer to the proposal. By 7 September, the Japanese side declared further negotiation useless and Kiri Project was terminated on 8 October 1940. **Another attempt at exploratory peace talks was made by Qian Yongming for the Chinese side, who had two delegates with Yōsuke Matsuoka in Tokyo on 12 October 1940. Their proposal for peace between Japan and China and the unification of the Jingwei and Kai-shek governments also included the entry of the unified Chinese state into the Anti-Comintern Pact. * 's accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact was part of the German demands in the run-up to the establishment of the Protectorate. These demands were designed by Germany to be rejected. * **The Netherlands were a candidate of choice for the Japanese for inclusion in the Anti-Comintern Pact.' Japanese ambassador Iwao Yamaguchi hoped that Dutch concerns about the situation in China and the potential dissent of the ethnic Chinese inhabitants of the Dutch East Indies, as well as communist insurgents in the colony, would lead the Dutch government to attempt to stabilize the relationship with Japan through accession to the pact. **Yamaguchi contacted the Dutch foreign minister Andries Cornelis Dirk de Graeff about the matter on 12 October 1936, but the Dutch government saw itself bound by public opinion to reject any diplomatic alignment with Japan, and the De Graeff pointed out that communist activity in the Dutch East Indies was not an imminent threat. However, he was willing to at least negotiate an intelligence exchange with Japan for the purpose of anti-communist activity in Asia. A second meeting on 24 October 1936 saw De Graeff outline that only the Dutch East Indies should be included in any intelligence exchange, whereas Yamaguchi hoped to include the Dutch mainland for the purpose of thwarting Comintern operations in Amsterdam (and covertly influencing the Dutch newspapers to be less critical of Japan in their reporting). The following day, 25 October 1936, Tony Lovink contacted Yamaguchi about a potential Dutch policy in which not only communism but all political ideologies in the Dutch East Indies could be suppressed and supervised in cooperation with the Japanese. This was the first of many signs that the Dutch government was not greatly concerned about fighting communism, but was much rather concerned with suppressing the Indonesian independence movement in the Dutch East Indies.'''' **Although the Netherlands remained interested in secretive intelligence exchanges, the Dutch government was hesitant to officially undertake a diplomatic alignment with Japan, caused by the fear of domestic and diplomatic backlash.'''' * had a fascist collaborationist government around Vidkun Quisling that, starting in 1942, sought to join the Anti-Comintern Pact to maximize its political legitimacy. * **In 1935, Poland had been one of the countries that Ribbentrop had hoped to induce into the pact.' Poland was also a very desired partner in Japan, which viewed Germany and Poland as rather close because of their 1934 Non-Aggression Pact and which viewed Poland as very committed in its anti-communist and anti- Soviet stances.' **When Ribbentrop and Neurath were in contact with Józef Lipski and Józef Beck about German-Polish anti-communist cooperation, Beck rejected a Polish entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact as impractical.'''' **The Polish entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact was part of the eight-point plan presented to Poland by Joachim von Ribbentrop.'' Poland rejected this proposal. The reason for Poland to reject the proposal were the Polish desire for a diplomatic equidistance between Germany and the Soviet Union, as well as military concerns about encroaching encirclement by Germany after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.'''' * was of interest as a possible member state, especially after Spain joined. As one of the only three countries to have voted against the Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations on 18 September (next to the Netherlands and Switzerland), it had a well-established anti-Soviet record. However, its economic dependency on and long-standing diplomatic allegiance to the United Kingdom made Portugal in the eyes of Oswald v. Hoyningen-Huene [de], the German ambassador to Portugal 1934–1945, unlikely to accept an invitation to the Anti-Comintern Pact.'''' * **British membership was part of Ribbentrop's original designs for the Anti-Comintern Pact in October 1935.'''' **When Joachim von Ribbentrop became ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1936, Hitler made clear to him that it was his 'greatest wish' to welcome Britain into the Anti-Comintern Pact. Ribbentrop was sceptical of Hitler's ambition, but placed some hope in King Edward VIII, who Ribbentrop perceived to be friendly to Germany.'' **When asked on 15 November 1937 whether the British government had received an invitation to the Anti- Comintern Pact, Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Robert Gascoyne-Cecil answered that no such invitation had taken place. * **Yugoslavia was Axis- friendly during the tenure of Milan Stojadinović as Prime Minister, and Germany and Italy were optimistic about its accession in January 1939.' Stojadinović was however ousted in February 1939, and the subsequent Cvetković administration was more cautious and non-aligned.' **The Cvetković administration, pressured by the diplomatic alignment of Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria with the Axis Powers, joined the Anti-Comintern Pact's successor, the Tripartite Pact, on 25 March 1941. Dušan Simović, in response, executed the Yugoslav coup d'état on 27 March, cancelling Yugoslavia's entry into the Tripartite Pact. In response, the Axis Powers executed the Invasion of Yugoslavia on 6 April.''''  The Anti-Comintern Pact after 1945  = Legacy of the Anti-Comintern Pact = The Anti-Comintern Pact ended up playing a significant role at the Nuremberg trials and was specifically mentioned in the verdict that sentenced Joachim von Ribbentrop to death.'''' = Historical reception and historiography of the Anti-Comintern Pact = American historian Paul W. Schroeder, professor emeritus of the University of Illinois, interprets the Anti-Comintern Pact in his 1958 book The Axis Alliance and Japanese-American Relations 1941 as a diplomatic statement by Germany and Japan that had no actual military value and was \\"hardly dangerous in itself\\".' Schroeder also comments on the rather loose German-Japanese ties that resulted from the pact,' as well as the lack of German and Japanese commitment towards the agreement.' Schroeder's conclusion ultimately sees in the Anti-Comintern Pact a continuation of a pattern in Japanese foreign policy since the 1890s in which Japan was opportunistic in grasping at chances at expansion, like the First Sino-Japanese War 1894, the Russo-Japanese War 1904 and the twenty-one demands of 1915.' Ruth Henig, British historian and later politician for the Labour Party, noted in her 1985 book The Origins of the Second World War 1933-1941 that the agreement's ideological component, in that the Anti- Comintern pact underlined the \\"onward march of fascism\\" in order \\"to combat the spread of communist regimes\\", but that a real threat from the pact also came to the liberal democratic United Kingdom.' In a 2001 contribution to The Paris Peace Conference, 1919: Peace Without Victory, Henig also notes that the public in Germany, Italy, Japan and even the United Kingdom itself was at large disinterested in foreign policy and the assurance of international peace, and that those few individuals who took an active interest in global affairs often did so chauvinistically and nationalistically, and that the interwar period 1918-1939 was marked by the breakup of old alliances (like the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and the Stresa Front).' As part of the German Bundeswehr's Military History Research Office's series Germany and the Second World War, German military historian Manfred Messerschmidt states in the first volume, The Build-up of German Aggression of 1990, that the Anti-Comintern Pact, just like the Axis Powers as a whole, was just a \\"patching together of divergent political interests\\". Messerschmidt also comments on Hitler's ambivalence between including either Italy or the United Kingdom into the pact.' In regards to the role of Japan, Messerschmidt, like Schroeder 1958, sees the Anti-Comintern Pact as a continuation of established Japanese policy, but also notes that Japan's internal political apparatus was so divided between the interests of the Japanese army, navy and government that almost by definition no action by the Tokyo leadership could be seen as any sort of unified opinion of the entire Japanese establishment. Messerschmidt also disagrees with the notion that Italy's accession to the pact necessarily gave it an anti-British thrust, but that Italian accession established a basis of the treaty in the first place. The interests of Germany and Japan were too different and the Japanese position after the beginning of the war against China in 1937 too weak to pose a threat to any enemy, Soviet Union or United Kingdom. As a result, Messerschmidt disagrees with the idea that the pact went from anti-Soviet to anti-British on the basis that it effectively already stopped being anti-Soviet as soon as Japan invaded China in June 1937, not when Italy joined the agreement in November of that same year.' However, Messerschmidt does agree that Hitler's support for Japan, which followed from Ribbentrop's agenda in the far east, was destined to hurt Anglo-German relations, whether Hitler intended to have it be so or not. The actions that Germany took that favored Japan and disfavored China included the cessation of aid deliveries to the Kai-shek government, the recall of advisors from China and open declarations of political support for Japanese actions starting in October 1937. All of these actions, according to Messerschmidt's argument, were bound to offend the pro-Chinese position of the United Kingdom.'''' In his biography of Adolf Hitler, British historian Sir Ian Kershaw wrote in 2000 that Hitler's approval for the Anti-Comintern Pact marked the diplomatic union of \\"the two most militaristic, expansionist powers in the world\\", but that \\"[t]he pact was more important for its symbolism than for its actual provisions\\".' Kershaw in his interpretation of the power structures within Nazi Germany is a proponent of the \\"working towards the Führer\\" thesis, in which, while Hitler was the guiding ideological figure in the German state whose favor all political actors within the German government (in case of the Anti-Comintern Pact: Ribbentrop) attempted to win, the dictator was in fact rather uninvolved in the day-to-day government proceedings.'

It is framed by the provinces of Pangasinan and La Union and sits between the Zambales Mountains and the Cordillera Central. The Agno River drains into Lingayen Gulf. Geography Hundred Islands National Park Labrador The gulf has numerous islands, the most famous of which are in the Hundred Islands National Park. This tourist attraction features 123 islands, the majority of which are small in size. The largest island is Cabarruyan Island, which constitutes the municipality of Anda, Pangasinan, followed by Santiago Island at the mouth of the Gulf. The shore from Labrador to San Fabian is characterized by a long grey-sand beach. Other well-known beaches are at Bolinao and San Fernando City. The waters of Lingayen Gulf are murky due to its sandy bottom. Coral reefs were all but destroyed by dynamite fishing, although efforts are made to restore some, especially inside the Hundred Islands National Park.Lonely Planet: Philippines, Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd., 9th edition, June 2006, A number of cities are found along the gulf's coast such as Dagupan City and Alaminos in Pangasinan, and San Fernando City in La Union. Lingayen, the capital of Pangasinan, also lies on the shores of the gulf. =River sources= The gulf has five major river sources. Flowing from the province of Pangasinan in the south are the Agno, Dagupan and Angalacan-Bued rivers. From the east in the province of La Union flow the Aringay and Bauang rivers. History Lingayen Gulf landings and Japanese advance, 22–24 December 1941 During World War II, the Lingayen Gulf proved a strategically important theatre of war between American and Japanese forces. On 22 December 1941, the Japanese 14th Army under Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma landed on the Eastern part of the gulf at Agoo, Caba, Santiago and Bauang, where they engaged in a number of relatively minor skirmishesEncyclopedia of American History with the defenders, which consisted of a poorly equipped contingent of predominantly Filipino and American troops, and managed to successfully invade and occupy the gulf. Following the defeat, the next day General MacArthur issued the order to retreat from Luzon and withdraw to Bataan. For the next three years, the gulf remained under Japanese occupation prior to the Lingayen Gulf Landings. At 09:30 on 9 January 1945, the U.S. 6th Army conducted an amphibious landing on the gulf, following a devastating naval bombardment, with 68,000 troops landing on the first day alone, and a total of 203,608 in following landings along a beachhead, stretching from Sual, Lingayen, and Dagupan (XIV Corps) in the west, and San Fabian (I Corps) into the east. Despite the Americans' success in driving out the Japanese army encamped at the Gulf, the Americans suffered relatively heavy losses, particularly on their convoys due to Japanese kamikaze suicide attacks. From 4 through 12 January, a total of 24 ships were sunk and 67 damaged by kamikaze planes, including the battleships and (accidentally hit by friendly fire), the heavy cruiser USS Louisville (CA-28), the light cruiser , and the minesweepers and .Pacific wrecks - Lingayan Gulf Following the amphibious landings, the Lingayen Gulf was turned into a vast supply depot for the rest of the war to support the American and Filipino assaults on Manila and the rest of Luzon, and thence to Okinawa. =Commemoration= World War II Memorial Ground Site, Town Park & Capitol Grounds (Lingayen, Pangasinan). On January 9, 2008, Gov. Amado Espino, Jr. and Vice Gov. Marlyn Primicias-Agabas established an annual commemoration to honor the war veterans. The resolution named January 9 as Pangasinan Veterans’ Day. In the 63rd anniversary of the Lingayen Gulf landings, President Fidel Ramos (a West Point graduate) appealed to U.S. President George W. Bush for 24,000 surviving war veterans, to pass two legislative bills pending since 1968 at the U.S. House of Representatives — the Filipino Veterans’ Equity Act of 2006 and the Filipino Veterans’ Equity of 2005 sponsored by former Senator Daniel Inouye.Abs-Cbn Interactive, 63rd anniversary of Lingayen Gulf Landing commemorated Economy Fishing and salt-making are the primary industries on Lingayen Gulf. In fact, the name Pangasinan literally means “place where salt is made”. Salt is collected from seawater through evaporation, leaving the crystalline salt behind. The Lingayen Gulf is also home to the 1200 megawatt Sual Power Station, the Philippines largest coal power plant.

Generally, if more eumelanin is present, the color of the hair is darker; if less eumelanin is present, the hair is lighter. Levels of melanin can vary over time causing a person's hair color to change, and it is possible to have hair follicles of more than one color on the same person. Particular hair colors are often associated with ethnic groups, while gray or white hair is associated with age. Genetics and biochemistry of hair color The full genetic basis of hair color is complex and not fully understood. Regulatory DNA is believed to be closely involved in pigmentation in humans in general, and a 2011 study by Branicki et al. identified 13 DNA variations across 11 different genes that could be used to predict hair color. Two types of pigment give hair its color, black-brown eumelanin and reddish-brown/reddish-yellow pheomelanin, synthesized by melanocytes. Inside the melanocytes, tyrosine is converted into L-DOPA and then L-dopaquinone, which in turn is formed into pheomelanin or eumelanin. Different hair color phenotypes arise primarily as a result of varying ratios of these two pigments in the human population, although Europeans show the greatest range in pigmentation overall. In addition, other genetic and environmental factors can affect hair color in humans; for instance, mutations in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene can lead to red or auburn hair, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation can damage hair and alter its pigmentation. Ultraviolet radiation (UV radiation) triggers greater synthesis of several compounds, including pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), α-MSH, and ACTH, the end result being increased eumelanin production. UV radiation most commonly comes from the sun, and thus populations from places closer to the equator tend to have darker hair, because eumelanin is generally more photoprotective than pheomelanin. Pheomelanin colors hair orange and red. Eumelanin, which has two subtypes of black or brown, determines the darkness of the hair color; more black eumelanin leads to blacker hair, and more brown eumelanin to browner hair. All human hair has some amount of both pigments. Over 95% of melanin content in black and brown hair is eumelanin. Pheomelanin is generally found in elevated concentrations in blond and red hair, representing about one-third of total melanin content. If there is no black eumelanin, the result is strawberry blond. blond hair results from small amounts of brown eumelanin with no black eumelanin. Natural hair colors Natural hair color can be brown, blond, red, or white; all natural hair colors including gray, white and lightest blond, are shades of brown. Children in Afghanistan with brown hair =Color shade scale= The Fischer–Saller scale, named after Eugen Fischer and , is used in physical anthropology and medicine to determine the shades of hair color. The scale uses the following designations: A (very light blond), B to E (light blond), F to L (blond), M to O (dark blond), P to T (light brown to brown), U to Y (dark brown/black) and Roman numerals I to IV (red) and V to VI (red blond). =Image gallery= File:Girl with long black hair (ponytail), rear view.jpgBlack hair File:Chinese American girl.jpgNatural black hair File:Lymari Nadal.jpgDeepest brown hair File:Short brown hair.jpgDark brown hair File:Sassy Locks of Love Feb 2011.jpgMedium brown hair File:Training of Seattle Mist Lingerie Football 0074.jpgLightest brown hair File:Little girl with brown hair.jpgNatural brown hair File:Goofy Boy.jpgLight brown hair File:Yvonne Catterfeld.jpgChestnut brown hair File:A child of chappargram.JPGLight chestnut brown hair File:Rotschopf.jpgAuburn hair File:Rupert Grint.jpgRed hair File:German Woman Portrait - Dutch summer festival of the Redhead Day in Breda, September 2010.jpgGinger red hair File:נערה ג'ינג'ית.JPGCopper hair File:Elena Kazantseva 00.jpgTitian hair File:Strawberry Blond Girl.jpgStrawberry blond hair File:Lucy Merriam.jpgLight blond hair File:Goldenblonde.JPGGolden blond hair File:TKvamme.jpgMedium blond hair File:Kofi Annan.jpgGrey hair File:Rapolder uwe 600.jpgWhite hair File:Albinisitic man portrait.jpgWhite hair caused by albinism =Brown hair= A woman with brown hair Brown hair is the second most common human hair color, after black. Brown hair is characterized by higher levels of eumelanin and lower levels of pheomelanin. Of the two types of eumelanin (black and brown), brown-haired people have brown eumelanin; they also usually have medium-thick strands of hair. Brown-haired girls or women are often known as brunettes. Chestnut hair is a hair color which is a reddish shade of brown hair. In contrast to auburn hair, the reddish shade of chestnut is darker. Chestnut hair is common among the native peoples of Northern, Central, Western, and Eastern Europe. =Blond hair= Blond (sometimes blonde for women) hair ranges from nearly white (platinum blond, tow-haired) to a dark golden blond. Strawberry blond, a mixture of blond and red hair, is a much rarer type containing the most pheomelanin. Blond hair can have almost any proportion of pheomelanin and eumelanin, but has only small amounts of both. More pheomelanin creates a more golden or strawberry blond color, and more eumelanin creates an ash or sandy blond color. blond hair is most commonly found in Northern and Western Europeans and their descendants but can be found spread around most of Europe. Studies in 2012 showed that naturally blond hair of Melanesians is caused by a recessive mutation in tyrosinase- related protein 1 (TYRP1). In the Solomon Islands, 26% of the population carry the gene; however, it is absent outside of Oceania.Melanesian blond hair is caused by an amino acid change in TYRP1. =Black hair= Black hair is the darkest hair color. It has large amounts of eumelanin and is more dense than other hair colors. =Auburn hair= Uyghur girl with auburn hair Auburn hair ranges along a spectrum of light to dark red-brown shades. The chemicals which cause auburn hair are eumelanin (brown) and pheomelanin (red), with a higher proportion of red-causing pheomelanin than is found in average brown hair. It is most commonly found in individuals of Northern and Western European descent. It can also be the result of a mutation in the melanocortin 1 receptor gene. =Red hair= Red hair ranges from light strawberry blond shades to titian, copper, and completely red. Red hair has the highest amounts of pheomelanin, around 67%, and usually low levels of eumelanin. At 1–2% of the west Eurasian population, it is the least common hair color in the world. It is most prominently found in the British Isles. Scotland has the highest proportion of redheads; 13 percent of the population has red hair and approximately 40 percent carry the recessive redhead gene. =Gray and white hair = White hair is commonly seen in elderly people Gray or white hair is not caused by a true gray or white pigment, but is due to a lack of pigmentation and melanin. The clear hairs appear as gray or white because of the way light is reflected from the hairs. Gray hair color typically occurs naturally as people age (see aging or achromotrichia below). In some cases, gray hair may be caused by thyroid deficiencies, Waardenburg syndrome or a vitamin B12 deficiency. At some point in the human life cycle, cells that are located in the base of the hair's follicles slow, and eventually stop producing pigment. Piebaldism is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of melanocyte development, which may cause a congenital white forelock. Europeans often begin to grow gray hairs in their mid-30s while Asians begin graying in their late 30s, but most Africans retain their original hair color until their mid-40s. Permanently white hair starting in childhood can be genetically inherited, but unlike albinism, there are no negative medical implications. The trait follows X-linked recessive inheritance, and so is more common in men and women can be carriers without being affected. Graying is a gradual process; according to a study by L'Oreal, overall, of those between 45 and 65 years old, 74% had some gray hair, covering an average of 27% of their head, and approximately 1 in 10 people had no gray hairs even after the age of 60. Marie Antoinette syndrome is a proposed phenomenon in which sudden whitening is caused by stress. It has been found that some hairs can become colored again when stress is reduced. Conditions affecting hair color =Aging or achromotrichia= Children born with some hair colors may find it gradually darkens as they grow. Many blond, light brown, or red haired infants experience this. This is caused by genes being turned on and off during early childhood and puberty. A 41-year-old man with minimal gray hair Changes in hair color typically occur naturally as people age, eventually turning the hair gray and then white. This is called achromotrichia. Achromotrichia normally begins in the early to mid-twenties in men and late twenties in women. More than 60 percent of Americans have some gray hair by age 40. The age at which graying begins seems almost entirely due to genetics. Sometimes people are born with gray hair because they inherit the trait. The order in which graying happens is usually: nose hair, hair on the head, beard, body hair, eyebrows. In non-balding individuals, hair may grow faster once it turns gray. Unlike in the skin where pigment production is continuous, melanogenesis in the hair is closely associated with stages of the hair cycle. Hair is actively pigmented in the anagen phase and is \\"turned off\\" during the catagen phase, and absent during telogen.Slominski A, Paus R. Melanogenesis is coupled to murine anagen: Toward new concepts for the role of melanocytes and the regulation of melanogenesis in hair growth. J Invest Dermatol. 1993;101:90S–7S Thus, a single hair cannot be white on the root side, and colored on the terminal side. The same man at age 56, with fully-gray hair Several genes appear to be responsible for the process of graying. Bcl2 and Bcl-w were the first two discovered, then in 2016, the IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) gene was announced after a study of 6,000 people living in five Latin American countries. However, it found that environmental factors controlled about 70% of cases of hair graying. The change in hair color occurs when melanin ceases to be produced in the hair root and new hairs grow in without pigment. The stem cells at the base of hair follicles produce melanocytes, the cells that produce and store pigment in hair and skin. The death of the melanocyte stem cells causes the onset of graying. It remains unclear why the stem cells of one hair follicle may fail to activate well over a decade before those in adjacent follicles less than a millimeter apart. Vitamins and minerals that are known to slow down the graying process are vitamin B-12, C, D, H (Biotin), and the mineral iron.https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/5-foods-actually-help- prevent-185932006.html Also, an abnormal pituitary gland or thyroid gland can cause hair to turn gray. Graying of hair may be triggered by the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and abnormally low levels of the enzyme catalase, which breaks down hydrogen peroxide and relieves oxidative stress in patients suffering from vitiligo. Since vitiligo can cause eyelashes to turn white, the same process is believed to be involved in hair on the head (and elsewhere) due to aging. The anti-cancer drug imatinib has recently been shown to reverse the graying process. However, it is expensive and has potentially severe and deadly side effects, so it is not practical to use to alter a person's hair color. Nevertheless, if the mechanism of action of imatinib on melanocyte stem cells can be discovered, it is possible that a safer and less expensive substitute drug might someday be developed. It is not yet known whether imatinib has an effect on catalase, or if its reversal of the graying process is due to something else. =Stress= Anecdotes report that stress, both chronic and acute, may induce achromotrichia earlier in individuals than it otherwise would have. Proponents point to survivors of disasters, such as Titanic survivor Harold Bride, or high-level politicians such as Bill Clinton or Barack Obama. There is some evidence for chronic stress causing premature achromotrichia, but no definite link has been established. It is known that the stress hormone cortisol accumulates in human hair over time, but whether this has any effect on hair color has not yet been resolved. = UV damage = Excessive exposure to the sun is the most common cause of structural damage of the hair shaft. Photochemical hair damage encompasses hair protein degradation and loss, as well as hair pigment deterioration Photobleaching is common among people with European ancestry. Around 72 percent of customers who agreed to be involved in study (and also have European ancestry) reported in a recent 23andMe research that the sun lightens their hair. The company also have identified 48 genetic markers that may influence hair photobleaching. =Medical conditions= Albinism is a genetic abnormality in which little or no pigment is found in human hair, eyes, and skin. The hair is often white or pale blond. However, it can be red, darker blond, light brown, or rarely, even dark brown. Vitiligo is a patchy loss of hair and skin color that may occur as the result of an auto-immune disease. In a preliminary 2013 study, researchers treated the buildup of hydrogen peroxide which causes this with a light- activated pseudo-catalase. This produced significant media coverage that further investigation may someday lead to a general non-dye treatment for gray hair. Malnutrition is also known to cause hair to become lighter, thinner, and more brittle. Dark hair may turn reddish or blondish due to the decreased production of melanin. The condition is reversible with proper nutrition. Werner syndrome and pernicious anemia can also cause premature graying. A 2005 uncontrolled study demonstrated that people 50–70 years of age with dark eyebrows but gray hair are significantly more likely to have type II diabetes than those with both gray eyebrows and hair. =Artificial factors= A 1996 British Medical Journal study found that tobacco smoking may cause premature graying. Smokers were found to be four times more likely to begin graying prematurely, compared to nonsmokers. Gray hair may temporarily darken after inflammatory processes, after electron-beam-induced alopecia, and after some chemotherapy regimens. Much remains to be learned about the physiology of human graying. There are no special diets, nutritional supplements, vitamins, or proteins that have been proven to slow, stop, or in any way affect the graying process, although many have been marketed over the years. However, French scientists treating leukemia patients with a new cancer drug noted an unexpected side effect: some of the patients' hair color was restored to their pre-gray color. =Changes after death= The hair color of buried bodies can change. Hair contains a mixture of black-brown-yellow eumelanin and red pheomelanin. Eumelanin is less chemically stable than pheomelanin and breaks down faster when oxidized. The color of hair changes faster under extreme conditions. It changes more slowly under dry oxidizing conditions (such as in burials in sand or in ice) than under wet reducing conditions (such as burials in wood or plaster coffins).  Hair coloring A hairdresser colors a client's hair Hair color can be changed by a chemical process. Hair coloring is classed as \\"permanent\\" or \\"semi-permanent\\". Permanent hair color means that the hair's structure has been chemically altered until it is eventually cut away. This does not mean that the synthetic color will remain permanently. During the process, the natural color is removed, one or more shades, and synthetic color has been put in its place. All pigments wash out of the cuticle. Natural color stays in much longer and artificial will fade the fastest (depending on the color molecules and the form of the dye pigments). Permanent hair color gives the most flexibility because it can make hair lighter or darker as well as changing tone and color, but there are negatives. Constant (monthly or six-weekly) maintenance is essential to match new hair growing in to the rest of the hair, and to remedy fading. A one-color permanent dye creates a flat, uniform color across the whole head, which can look unnatural and harsh, especially in a fair shade. To combat this, the modern trend is to use multiple colors—usually one color as a base with added highlights or lowlights in other shades. Semi-permanent color washes out over a period of time—typically four to six weeks, so root regrowth is less noticeable. The final color of each strand is affected by its original color and porosity, so there will be subtle variations in color across the head—more natural and less harsh than a permanent dye. However, this means that gray and white hair will not dye to the same color as the rest of the head (in fact, some white hair will not absorb the color at all). A few gray and white hairs will blend in sufficiently not to be noticeable, but as they become more widespread, there will come a point where a semi-permanent alone will not be enough. The move to 100% permanent color can be delayed by using a semi- permanent as a base color, with permanent highlights. Semi-permanent hair color cannot lighten hair. Hair can only be lightened using chemical lighteners, such as bleach.

It has been united with the title of Earl of Nottingham under a single holder since 1729. The Finch family is believed to be descended from Henry FitzHerbert, Lord Chamberlain to Henry I (r. 1100–1135). The name change to Finch came in the 1350s after marriage to an heiress by a member of the Finch family.According to Burke's Peerage, 1934 (re:Finch, Earl of Winchilsea and Nottingham), quoting Sir William Dugdale, \\"the Finch family is probably descended from Henry FitzHerbert, Chamberlain of King Henry I and ancestor of the Herbert Earls of Pembroke. They are thought to have changed their name to Finch after marriage to an heiress daughter of an earlier Finch family\\". Thus the Herbert family of Wales, Earls of Pembroke, bear a differenced version of arms of FitzHerbert/Finch, as borne by FitzHerbert Baronets. In 1660 the 3rd Earl of Winchilsea was created Baron FitzHerbert of Eastwell, Kent, in recompense for his efficient aid in the Restoration of the Monarchy.Montague-Smith, P.W.

His son Sir Thomas Finch (died 1563), was also knighted for his share in suppressing Sir Thomas Wyatt's insurrection against Queen Mary I, and was the son-in-law of Sir Thomas Moyle, some of whose lands Finch's wife inherited. Thomas's eldest son Moyle Finch represented Weymouth, Kent and Winchelsea in the House of Commons. In 1611 he was created a baronet, of Eastwell in the County of Kent.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage 1900 History Sir Moyle Finch, 1st Baronet of Eastwell married Elizabeth Heneage, only daughter of Sir Thomas Heneage (1532–1595), Vice-Chamberlain of the Household to Queen Elizabeth I. After Sir Moyle's death in 1614 Elizabeth and her sons made considerable efforts to have the family's status elevated. On 8 July 1623 Elizabeth was raised to the Peerage of England as Viscountess Maidstone, and on 12 July 1628 she was further honoured when she was made Countess of Winchilsea. Lady Winchilsea and Sir Moyle Finch's youngest son the Hon. Sir Heneage Finch served as Speaker of the House of Commons and was the father of Heneage Finch, who was created Earl of Nottingham in 1681. Sir Moyle Finch was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son Theophilus, the 2nd Baronet (1573-1619). He sat as Member of Parliament for Great Yarmouth but died childless in circa 1619. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the 3rd Baronet. He represented Winchelsea and Kent in the House of Commons. In 1634 he also succeeded his mother as 2nd Earl of Winchilsea. His son, the 3rd Earl, supported the Restoration in 1660 and was thanked for his efforts the same year when he was created Baron FitzHerbert of Eastwell, in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his grandson, the 4th Earl. He was the son of William Finch, Viscount Maidstone (1652–1672), eldest son of the 3rd Earl. Lord Winchilsea served as President of the Board of Trade and as Lord Lieutenant of Kent. His wife Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, was a well-known poet. However, they had no children and Winchilsea was succeeded by his uncle, the 5th Earl. He had earlier represented Hythe in Parliament. He was childless and was succeeded by his half-brother, the 6th Earl. He never married and on his death in 1729 the Barony of FitzHerbert of Eastwell became extinct. He was succeeded in the remaining titles by his second cousin the 2nd Earl of Nottingham, who became the seventh Earl of Winchilsea as well (see below for earlier history of this branch of the family). He was a noted statesman and served as First Lord of the Admiralty, Secretary of State for the Southern Department, Secretary of State for the Northern Department and as Lord President of the Council. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the 8th Earl of Winchilsea. He was also a politician and held office as First Lord of the Admiralty and as Lord President of the Council. He was childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the 9th Earl. He was the son of the Hon. William Finch, second son of the 2nd Earl of Nottingham. The 9th Earl was Lord Lieutenant of Rutland for many years and was also an influential figure in the history of cricket. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the 10th Earl. He was the son of George Finch-Hatton (1747–1823) (who assumed the additional surname of Hatton), son of the Hon. Edward Finch, fifth son of the 2nd Earl of Nottingham and his wife the Hon. Anne Hatton, who was the daughter of Christopher Hatton, 1st Viscount Hatton (see the Viscount Hatton) and a relation of the famous Sir Christopher Hatton. The 10th Earl is famous for his duel with the Duke of Wellington, who was Prime Minister at the time. The duel, which was over the issue of Catholic emancipation and related to insulting remarks made by the Earl, took place at Battersea Fields on 21 March 1829. Both men deliberately aimed wide and Winchilsea apologised. He died in 1858 and was succeeded by his son, the 11th Earl. He represented Northamptonshire North in Parliament as a Tory. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his half-brother, the 12th Earl. He sat briefly as Conservative Member of Parliament for Lincolnshire South and for Spalding. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the 13th Earl. the titles are held by his great-great-grandson, the 17th Earl of Winchilsea and 12th Earl of Nottingham (the title having descended from father to son), who succeeded in 1999. The Hon. Sir Heneage Finch was the third and youngest son of Sir Moyle Finch and the Countess of Winchilsea. He served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1625 to 1628. His son Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham was a prominent lawyer and politician and served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1675 to 1682. He was created a baronet, of Raunston in the County of Buckingham, in the Baronetage of England in 1660 and in 1673 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Finch of Daventry in the County of Northampton. In 1681 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Nottingham, also in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his son, Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham, who in 1729 succeeded his second cousin as the seventh Earl of Winchilsea. See above for further history of the titles. Several other members of the Finch family have also gained distinction. The Hon. Heneage Finch, second son of the 1st Earl of Nottingham, was made Earl of Aylesford in 1714. The Hon. Edward Finch, fifth son of the 1st Earl of Nottingham, was a composer and sat as Member of Parliament for Cambridge University. He later took holy orders and served as Prebendary of York and Canterbury. The Hon. Edward Finch, fifth son of the 2nd Earl of Nottingham, sat as Member of Parliament for Cambridge University from 1727 to 1768. The Hon. Harold Heneage Finch-Hatton, fourth son of the 10th Earl, represented Newark in the House of Commons. The Hon. Denys Finch Hatton, younger brother of the 14th Earl, moved to East Africa and became a noted pilot and hunter, and a close friend of Karen Blixen. In the film Out of Africa he was played by Robert Redford. John Finch, 1st Baron Finch of Fordwich, was the son of Sir Henry Finch, younger brother of Sir Moyle Finch, 1st Baronet of Eastwell. George Finch, illegitimate son of the 9th Earl of Winchilsea, was a politician. His son, George Finch, was Father of the House of Commons. The earldom of 1628 is sometimes written Winchelsea, after the modern spelling of the town (and Cinque Port) in East Sussex. Family seat and motto The ancestral family seat is the Kirby Hall estate, near Corby, in Northamptonshire. The estate is still (2009) owned by the Earl of Winchilsea, although the palatial hall - now partially de-roofed - is no longer lived in by the family. The hall itself and the adjacent gardens are today administered by English Heritage. The Eastwell Park estate, near Ashford, Kent, was owned by the Earls of Winchilsea until the mid-1860s, when the 11th Earl had to leave the property due to financial difficulties;The Duke of Richmond and Another v. Calisher. In The Times, Wednesday 2 February 1870, p. 11. it was later occupied by The Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second son of Queen Victoria.

The theoretical concepts were proposed by Marshall McLuhan in 1964, while the term media ecology was first formally introduced by Marshall McLuhan in 1962. Ecology in this context refers to the environment in which the medium is used – what they are and how they affect society.Understanding Me: Lectures and Interviews, by Marshall McLuhan, edited by Stephanie McLuhan and David Staines, Foreword by Tom Wolfe. MIT Press, 2004, p. 271 Neil Postman states, \\"if in biology a 'medium' is something in which a bacterial culture grows (as in a Petri dish), in media ecology, the medium is 'a technology within which a [human] culture grows.'\\"Postman, N. (2006). Media Ecology Education. Explorations in Media Ecology, 5(1), 5–14. doi:10.1386/eme.5.1.5_1 In other words, \\"Media ecology looks into the matter of how media of communication affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; and how our interaction with media facilitates or impedes our chances of survival. The word ecology implies the study of environments: their structure, content, and impact on people. An environment is, after all, a complex message system which imposes on human beings certain ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving.\\" Media ecology argues that media act as extensions of the human senses in each era, and communication technology is the primary cause of social change. McLuhan is famous for coining the phrase, \\"the medium is the message\\", which is an often-debated phrase believed to mean that the medium chosen to relay a message is just as important (if not more so) than the message itself. McLuhan proposed that media influence the progression of society, and that significant periods of time and growth can be categorized by the rise of a specific technology during that period. Additionally, scholars have compared media broadly to a system of infrastructure that connect the nature and culture of a society with media ecology being the study of \\"traffic\\" between the two.  Background  =Marshall McLuhan= In 1934, Marshall McLuhan enrolled as a student at Cambridge University, a school which pioneered modern literary criticism. During his studies at Cambridge, he became acquainted with one of his professors, I.A. Richards, a distinguished English professor, who would inspire McLuhan's later scholarly works. McLuhan admired Richards' approach to the critical view that English studies are themselves nothing but a study of the process of communication. Richards believed that \\"words won't stay put and almost all verbal constructions are highly ambiguous\\". This element of Richards' perspective on communication influenced the way in which McLuhan expressed many of his ideas using metaphors and phrases such as \\"The Global Village\\" and \\"The Medium Is the Message\\", two of his most well-known phrases that encapsulate the theory of media ecology. Marshall McLuhan, c. 1936. McLuhan used the approaches of Richards, William Empson, and Harold Innis as an \\"entrée to the study of media\\". However, it took many years of work before he was able to successfully fulfill their approaches. McLuhan determined that \\"if words were ambiguous and best studied not in terms of their 'content' but in terms of their effects in a given context and if the effects were often subliminal, the same might be true of other human artifacts, the wheel, the printing press, the telegraph and the TV\\". This led to the emergence of his ideas on media ecology. In addition to his scholarly work, McLuhan was also a well known media personality of his day. He appeared on television shows, in magazine articles, and even had a small cameo in the movie Annie Hall. Walter Ong Few theories receive the kind of household recognition that media ecology received, due directly to McLuhan's role as a pop culture icon. He was an excellent debater and public speaker, but his writing was not always what would normally pass in academia. = Neil Postman = Inspired by McLuhan, Neil Postman founded the Program in Media Ecology at New York University in 1971, as he further developed the theory McLuhan had established. According to Postman, media ecology emphasizes the environments in which communication and technologies operate and spread information and the effects these have on the receivers.Postman, Neil. \\"What is Media Ecology.\\" Media Ecology Association. 2009. Web. 29 Sept 2014. \\"Such information forms as the alphabet, the printed word, and television images are not mere instruments which make things easier for us. They are environments – like language itself, symbolic environments within which we discover, fashion, and express humanity in particular ways.\\"Postman, Neil. \\"Teaching as a conserving activity.\\" Instructor 89.4 (1979). Postman focused on media technology, process, and structure rather than content and considered making moral judgments the primary task of media ecology. \\"I don't see any point in studying media unless one does so within a moral or ethical context.\\"Griffin, Em. A First Look at Communication Theory. 7th ed. New York, NY: The McGraw-Hill , 2009. Print Postman's media ecology approach asks three questions: What are the moral implications of this bargain? Are the consequences more humanistic or antihumanistic? Do we, as a society, gain more than we lose, or do we lose more than we gain? = Walter Ong = Walter J. Ong was a scholar with a master's degree in English who was once a student of McLuhan at the Saint Louis University. The contributions of Ong standardized and gave credibility to the field of media ecology as worthy of academic scholarship. Ong explored the changes in human thought and consciousness in the transition from a dominant oral culture to a literate one in his book Orality and Literacy. Ong's studies have greatly contributed to developing the concept of media ecology. Ong has written over 450 publications, many of which focused on the relation between conscious behavior and the evolution of the media, and he received the Media Ecology Association's Walter Benjamin Award for Outstanding Article for his paper, \\"Digitization Ancient and Modern: Beginnings of Writing and Today's Computers\\". = North American, European and Eurasian versions = Media ecology is a contested term within media studies for it has different meanings in European and North American contexts. The North American definition refers to an interdisciplinary field of media theory and media design involving the study of media environments. The European version of media ecology is a materialist investigation of media systems as complex dynamic systems. In Russia, a similar theory was independently developed by Yuri Rozhdestvensky. In more than five monographs, Rozhdestvensky outlined the systematic changes which take place in society each time new communication media are introduced, and connected these changes to the challenges in politics, philosophy and education. He is a founder of the vibrant school of ecology of culture. The European version of media ecology rejects the North American notion that ecology means environment. Ecology in this context is used \\"because it is one of the most expressive [terms] language currently has to indicate the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter\\". Following theorists such as Felix Guattari, Gregory Bateson, and Manuel De Landa, the European version of media ecology (as practiced by authors such as Matthew Fuller and Jussi Parikka) presents a post-structuralist political perspective on media as complex dynamical systems. = Other contributions = Along with McLuhan , Postman and Harold Innis, media ecology draws from many authors, including the work of Walter Ong, Lewis Mumford, Jacques Ellul, Félix Guattari, Eric Havelock, Susanne Langer, Erving Goffman, Edward T. Hall, George Herbert Mead, Margaret Mead, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Benjamin Lee Whorf, and Gregory Bateson. Core concepts = Assumptions of the theory = * Media are infused in every act and action in society. * Media fix our perceptions and organize our experiences. * Media tie the world together. These three assumptions can be understood as: media are everywhere all the time; media determine what we know and how we feel about what we know; and media connect us to others. Communication media have penetrated the lives of almost all people on the planet, arranging people into an interconnected human community. =McLuhan's media history= Marshall McLuhan defined media as anything requiring use of the human body. Under this definition, both computers and clothing can be identified as media. When a media is introduced it is adapted to human senses so that it becomes an extension of the individual, and its capabilities influence the whole of society, leading to change.Rogaway, P. (1994). Marshall McLuhan interview from Playboy, 1969. ECS 188: Ethics in the Age of Technology, University of California, Davis McLuhan states that there are three inventions that transformed the world: the phonetic alphabet, by virtue of its ability to make speech visible, which McLuhan argues gave rise to the discipline of rhetoric in ancient time and to the study of language and poetics, which was also known as grammar. The printing press in the nineteenth century and the telegraph led to both the modern newspaper and also to journalism as an academic pursuit.Strate, L. (2008). Media ecology scholars also use broad categories like oral, scribal, print, and electronic cultures. Studying media as media: McLuhan and the media ecology approach. The introduction of broadcasting in the form of radio, following on the heels of mass circulation newspapers, magazines, as well as the movies, resulted in the study of mass communication. Due to these technologies, the world was taken from one era into the next. In order to understand the effects of symbolic environment, McLuhan splits history into four periods: the Tribal Age, the Literacy Age, the Print Age, and the Electronic Age. McLuhan states that, in order to study media effectively, one must study not only content but also the whole cultural environment in which media thrives.Delicata, N. (2008). Marshall McLuhan: Media Ecologist and Educator. Ultimate Reality and Meaning, 31(4), 314-341. He argues that using a detached view allows the individual to observe the phenomenon of the whole as it operates within the environment. The effects of media - speech, writing, printing, photograph, radio or television – should be studied within the social and cultural spheres impacted by this technology. McLuhan argues that all media, regardless of content, acts on the senses and reshapes sensory balance, further reshaping the society that created it. This differs from the viewpoints of scholars such as Neil Postman, who argue that society should take a moral view of new media whether good or bad.Postman, N. (2000, June). The humanism of media ecology. In Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association (Vol. 1, No. 1, pp. 10-16) McLuhan further notes that media introduced in the past brought gradual changes, which allowed people and society some time to adjust. Tribal age The first period in history that McLuhan describes is the Tribal Age. To McLuhan, this was a time of community, with the ear being the dominant sense organ. With everyone able to hear at the same time, listening to someone in a group a unifying act, deepening the feeling of community. In this set up, McLuhan argues, everything was more immediate, more present, and fostered more passion and spontaneity. Literacy age The second age McLuhan outlines is the Literacy Age, beginning with the invention of writing. To McLuhan, this was a time of private detachment, with the eye being the dominant sense organ. Turning sounds into visible objects radically altered the symbolic environment. Words were no longer alive and immediate, they were able to be read over and over again. Even though people would read the same words, the act of reading made communication an individual act, leading to more independent thought. Tribes didn't need to come together to get information anymore. Print age The third stage McLuhan describes is the Print Age, when individual media products were mass-produced due to the invention of the printing press. It gave the ability to reproduce the same text over and over again. With printing came a new visual stress: the portable book, which allowed people to carry media so they could read in privacy isolated from others. Libraries were created to hold these books and also gave freedom to be alienated from others and from their immediate surroundings. Electronic age Lastly, McLuhan describes the Electronic Age, otherwise included under the information age, as an era of instant communication and a return to an environment with simultaneous sounds and touch. It started with a device created by Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph and led to the telephone, the cell phone, television, internet, DVD, video games, etc. This ability to communicate instantly returns people to the tradition of sound and touch rather than sight. McLuhan argues that being able to be in constant contact with the world becomes a nosy generation where everyone knows everyone's business and everyone's business is everyone else's. This phenomenon is called the global village. Later scholars have described the growth of open access and open science, with their potential for highly distributed and low cost publishing reaching much larger audiences, as a potential \\"de-professionalizing force\\".  Updating the ages  Robert K. Logan is professor emeritus of physics at the University of Toronto and Chief Scientist of the Strategic Innovation Lab at the Ontario College of Art and Design. He worked collaboratively with Marshall McLuhan at the University of Toronto, co-publishing various works and producing his own works, heavily inspired by McLuhan. Logan updates the era of communications, adding two new eras: # Age of nonverbal mimetic communication (characteristic of archaic Homo sapiens) # Age of orality # Age of literacy # Age of electric mass media # Age of digital interactive media, or 'new media' In addition, through the study of media ecology, it is argued that through technological advancements in media, many societies have become a \\"participatory culture\\". Tom Valcanis argues that this very easily witnessed by looking at the rise of Apple's iPhone. \\"If the technology is the medium in which a culture grows, the interactive and user oriented nature of these technologies have given rise to a participatory and 'mash-up' culture in which the ways of producing and accessing content are deconstructed, uploaded, mixed, converged, and reconstructed through computers and smartphones mediated by online platforms; it becomes a 'participatory culture'...\\" ='The medium is the message'= \\"The medium is the message\\" is the most famous insight from McLuhan, and is one of the concepts that separates the North American theory from the European theory. Instead of emphasizing the information content, McLuhan highlighted the importance of medium characteristics which can influence and even decide the content. He proposed that it is the media format that affects and changes on people and society. For example, traditional media is an extension of the human body, while the new media is the extension of the human nervous system. The emergence of new media will change the equilibrium between human sensual organs and affect human psychology and society. The extension of human senses will change our thoughts and behaviors and the ways we perceive the world. That's why McLuhan believed when a new medium appears, no matter what the concrete content it transmits, the new form of communication brings in itself a force that causes social transformation. We are accustomed to thinking the message is separate from a medium. McLuhan saw the message and the medium to mean the same thing. The audience is normally focused on the content and overlooks the medium. What we forget is that the content cannot exist outside of the way that it is mediated. McLuhan recognized that the way media work as environments is because we are so immersed in them. \\"It is the medium that has the greatest impact in human affairs, not specific messages we send or receive.\\"Strate, Lance. \\"Studying Media as Media: McLuhan and the Media Ecology Approach.\\" MediaTropes eJournal. 1. (2008): 1–16. Web. 28 Nov. 2011. The media shape us because we partake in them over and over until they become a part of us. Different mediums emphasize different senses and encourage different habits, so engaging in this medium day after day conditions our senses. Different forms of media also affect what their meaning and impact will be. The form of medium and mode of information determines who will have access, how much information will be distributed, how fast it will be transmitted, how far it will go, and, most importantly, what form it will be displayed. With society being formed around the dominant medium of the day, the specific medium of communication makes a remarkable difference.  The metaphor  The key elements to media ecology have been largely attributed to Marshall McLuhan, who coined the statement \\"the medium is the message\\". Levinson furthers McLuhan's statement by stating that \\"the way we communicate, often taken for granted, often determines what we communicate, and therein just about everything else in life and society\\". McLuhan gave a center of gravity, a moral compass to media ecology which was later adapted and formally introduced by Neil Postman The very foundation for this theory is based on a metaphor that provides a model for understanding the new territory, offers a vocabulary, and indicates in which directions to continue exploring. As Carlos Scolari states, \\"the configuration of media ecology in the 1960s and 1970s was part of a broader process of the general application of the ecological metaphor to the social sciences and humanities in the postwar period. There is still a scholarly debate over who coined the phrase \\"the medium is the message\\". Author Niall Stephens argues that while most attribute the metaphor to Marshall McLuhan, it is better directed to Neil Postman, who helped popularize McLuhan under the banner of \\"media ecology\\". Scholar Janet Sternberg has a different take on the metaphor- using her own metaphor to make sense of it all. Sternberg applies the Chinese \\"yin/ yang\\" metaphor to media ecology as a means of better understanding the divergence among scholars. She states that there are two basic intellectual traditions that can be distinguished in the field: the \\"yang\\" tradition of studying media as environments, focusing on mass communication and on intrapersonal communication and the \\"yin\\" tradition is studying environments as media, emphasizing interpersonal communication.  Connection to general systems theory  While general systems theory originated in 1928 in the Ph.D. thesis of Ludwig von Bertalanffy. Robert Logan summarizes a general system as \\"one that is composed of interacting and interrelated components such as an understanding of it must entail considering the general system as a whole and not as a collection of individual components\\". Logan argues that general systems theory, as well as cybernetics, complexity theory, and emergent dynamics, and media ecology \\"cross pollinate each other\\" in that, \\"a general system is a medium\\" due to the non-linear aspects of messages and that general systems are \\"quasi-deterministic\\". This thinking is in line with McLuhan who once wrote, \\"A new medium is never an addition to an old one, nor does it leave the old one in peace. It never ceases to oppress the older media until it finds new shapes and positions for them.\\" = Global village = Marshall McLuhan used the phrase global village to characterize an end to isolation: \\"humans can no longer live in isolation, but rather will always be connected by continuous and instantaneous electronic media\\". McLuhan addresses the idea of a global village in his book The Gutenberg Galaxy saying, \\"Such is the character of a village or, since electric media, such is also the character of global village. And it is the advertising and PR community that is most aware of this basic new dimension of global interdependence\\". Technology, especially electronic media in today's age, makes the world increasingly interconnected. Socially, economically, politically, culturally, what happens in one part of the world has a ripple effect into other countries. This seems like a common sense idea today, where the internet makes it possible to check news stories around the globe, and social media connects individuals regardless of location. However, in McLuhan's day, the global village was just becoming possible due to technology like television and long distance phone calls. This concept has become one of the most prolific and understandable ideas to come out of media ecology, and has spurred significant research in many areas. It is especially relevant in today's society, where the internet, social media, and other new media have made the world a smaller place, and today many researchers give McLuhan credit for his foresight. Of note is McLuhan's insistence that the world becoming a global village should lead to more global responsibility. Technology has created an interconnected world, and with that should come concern for global events and occurrences outside one's own community. Postman builds on this concept with the idea of teaching the narrative of 'Spaceship Earth' where students are taught the importance of everyone taking care of planet earth as a fragile system of diversity both biological and cultural; however, the original person to coin the term 'Spaceship Earth' was futurists Buckminster Fuller, who once said, \\"I've often heard people say: 'I wonder what it would feel like to board a spaceship,' and the answer is very simple. What does it feel like? That's all we have experienced. We're all astronauts on a little spaceship called earth.\\" Critics do worry though, that in creating a truly global village, some cultures will become extinct due to larger or more dominant cultures imposing their beliefs and practices. The idea of the global village helps to conceptualize globalization within society. Michael Plugh writes, \\"[The] village is an environment produced both by technological change and human imagination of this globalized environment.\\" Additionally, the rise in media communication technology has uniformed the way individuals across the globe process information. Plugh says, \\"Where literate societies exchange an 'eye for an ear,' according to McLuhan, emphasizing the linear and sequential order of the world, electronic technology retrievers the total awareness of environment, characteristic of oral cultures, yet to an extended or 'global' level.\\" =Hot vs. cool media= McLuhan developed an idea called hot and cold media.McLuhan, Marshall, and Quentin Fiore. \\"The medium is the message.\\" New York 123 (1967): 126–128. Hot media is high-definition communication that demands little involvement from the audience and concentrates on one sensory organ at a time. This type of media requires no interpretation because it give all the information necessary to comprehend. Some examples of hot media include radio, books, and lectures. Cool media is media that demands active involvement from the audience, requiring the audience to be active and provide information by mentally participating. This is multi-sensory participation. Some examples of cool media are TV, seminars, and cartoons. \\"McLuhan frequently referred to a chart that hung in his seminar room at the University of Toronto. This was a type of shorthand for understanding the differences between hot and cool media, characterized by their emphasis on the eye or the ear.\\"Harold Innis: The Philosophical Historian. An Exchange of Ideas Between Prof. Marshall McLuhan and Prof. Eric A. Havelock,\\" recorded at Innis College, Toronto, October 14, 1978. * Eye: left hemisphere (hot) controls right side of the body; visual; speech; verbal; analytical; mathematical; linear; detailed; sequential; controlled; intellectual; dominant worldly;quantitative; active; sequential ordering * Ear: right hemisphere (cool) controls the left side of the body; spatial; musical; acoustic; holistic; artistic; symbolic; simultaneous; emotional; creative; minor; spiritual; qualitative; receptive; synthetic; gestalt; facial recognition; simultaneous comprehension; perception of abstract patterns =Laws of media= Another aspect of media ecology is the laws of media, which McLuhan outlined with his son Eric McLuhan to further explain the influence of technology on society. The laws of media theory are depicted by a tetrad, which poses questions about various media, with the goal of developing peoples' critical thinking skills and to prepare people for \\"the social and physical chaos\\" that accompany every technological advancement or development. There is no specific order to the laws of media, as the effects occur simultaneously and form a feedback loop: technology impacts society, which then impacts the development of technology. Depiction of Media Tetrad The four effects, as depicted in the tetrad of media effects are: * Enhancement: What does the medium enhance? Media can enhance various social interactions, such as the telephone, which reduced the need for face-to-face interactions. * Obsolescence: What does the medium obsolesce? Technological advancements can render older media obsolete, as television did for the radio. This does not necessarily mean that the older medium is completely eradicated however, as radio, for example, is still in use today. * Retrieval: What does the medium retrieve? New media can also spur a restoration of older forms of media, which the new forms may not be able to incorporate into their new technologies. For example, the Internet has promoted new forms of social conversations, which may have been lost through television. * Reversal: What will the medium reverse? When a medium is overwhelmed due to its own nature, \\"pushed to the limit of its potential,\\" it ceases to have functional utility and can cause a reversion to older media. Criticism =Technological determinism= A significant criticism of this theory is a result of its deterministic approach. Determinism insists that all of society is a result of or effected by one central condition. In some cases the condition can be language (linguistic determinism), religion (theological determinism), financial (economic determinism). In the case of McLuhan, Postman and Media Ecology, technology is the sole determinant for society and by breaking up time in measures of man's technological achievements they can be classified as technological determinism. According to Postman, \\"The printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information.\\"Postman, Teaching as a Conserving Activity (1979), p. 39 Postman has also stated that \\"a medium is a technology within which a culture grows; that is to say, it gives form to a culture's politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking\\". Scholars such as Michael Zimmer view McLuhan and his \\"Medium is the Message\\" theory as a prime example of technological determinism: > ...an overarching thread in media ecological scholarship, exemplified by > McLuhan's (1964/1994) assertion that \\"the medium is the message\\", the > technological bias of a medium carries greater importance than the > particular message it is delivering. McLuhan saw changes in the dominant > medium of communication as the main determinant of major changes in society, > culture, and the individual. This McLuhanesque logic, which rests at the > center of the media ecology tradition, is often criticized for its media > determinism. Seeing the biases of media technologies as the primary force > for social and cultural change resembles the hard technological determinism > of the embodied theory of technological bias. The critics of such a deterministic approach could be theorists who practice other forms of determinism, such as economic determinism. Theorists such as John Fekete believes that McLuhan is oversimplifying the world \\"by denying that human action is itself responsible for the changes that our socio- cultural world is undergoing and will undergo, McLuhan necessarily denies that a critical attitude is morally significant or practically important.\\" Lance Strate, on the other hand, argues that McLuhan's theories are in no way deterministic. \\"McLuhan never actually used the term, \\"determinism,\\" nor did he argue against human agency. In his bestselling book, The Medium is the Message, he wrote, \\"there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening\\" (McLuhan & Fiore, 1967, p. 25). John Culkin (1967) summed up McLuhan's position with the quote, \\"we shape our tools and thereafter they shape us\\", suggesting a transactional approach to media.\\" This statement from Strate would define McLuhan and Media Ecology as \\"soft determinism\\" opposed to \\"hard determinism\\" with the difference being that \\"hard determinism\\" indicates that changes to society happen with no input or control from the members of that society, whereas \\"soft determinism\\" would argue that the changes are pushed by technology but free will and agency of the members of society ultimately have a chance to influence the outcome. While ideas of technological determinism generally have negative connotations, technology philosopher Paul-Peter Verbeek argued that technologies are \\"inherently moral agents\\" and their development is a \\"moral enterprise\\". = Disruptions to existing systems = While advancing technologies allow for the study of media ecology, they also frequently disrupt the existing system of communication as they emerge. In general, four types of disruption can occur within the study of media ecology. # New Technologies # New Audiences # New Authority #New Rhetoric One example where this can be seen is in do-it- yourself education. Advancing technologies have also expanded access to do-it- yourself (DIY) education. DIY education can be defined to include \\"any attempt to decentralize or disrupt traditional place-based educational models through the sometimes collective, other times individual use of digital media\\". Through an analysis of media ecology the impact of these new technologies on society can better be understood.  Mobility and modality  Various scholars have looked to media ecology theory through different lenses to better understand this theory in the 21st century. While Sternberg applied the yin/yang metaphor to make sense of the theory, Julia Hildebrand and John Dimmick et al. create a new languages of modality. As such, contributing to a new rhetoric to contextualize media ecology in the age of the internet, social media, and advances in technologies. Hildebrand uses the conceptualization of 'mediated mobilities' to illustrate a connection between media ecology and mobilities research, ultimately making a case for a modal medium theory. She looks into the articles of Emily Keightley and Anna Reading, and Lance Strate as a basis for her case. In 1999, Lance Strate states media ecology theory is \\"grammar and rhetoric, semiotics and systems theory, the history and the philosophy of technology\\". Hildebrand explains that Strate's concept of media ecology is not limited to the study of information and communication technology but technology, in general. Technology is therefore implying materialities and mobilities that is put into relation with media ecology. As Hildebrand states, \\"[e]nvironments are created and shaped by different media and modes and the physical, virtual, and mental processes and travels they generate\\". Much like media ecology, mobilities research talk about a \\"flow\\" that shapes the environment, creating a contact zones. Dimmick furthers this explanation with the concept of interstices as the intersection of communication environments and issues of mobility. He quotes two scholars, Hemment and Caronia, to contextualize his new word. Hemment argues that mobile technologies create a place out of space and time, a kind of \\"nonspace\\" or \\"nonplace\\" considering they are independent from the variables of space and time. Caronia notes that such technologies extend media to creating empty space and places. =The medium is not the message= McLuhan's critics state the medium is not the message. They believe that we are dealing with a mathematical equation where medium equals x and message equals y. Accordingly, x = y, but really \\"the medium is the message\\" is a metaphor not an equation. His critics also believe McLuhan is denying the content altogether, when really McLuhan was just trying to show the content in its secondary role in relation to the medium. McLuhan says technology is an \\"extension of man\\" and when the way we physically sense the world changes, how we perceive it will also collectively change, but the content may or may not affect this change in perception. McLuhan said that the user is the content, and this means that the user must interpret and process what they receive, finding sense in their own environments. One of McLuhan's high-profile critics was Umberto Eco. Eco comes from background in semiotics, which goes beyond linguistics in that it studies all forms of communication. He reflected that a cartoon of a cannibal wearing an alarm clock as a necklace was counter to McLuhan's assertion that the invention of clocks created a concept of time as consistently separated space. While it could mean this it could also take on different meanings as in the depiction of the cannibal. The medium is not the message. An individual's interpretation can vary. Believing this to be true Eco says, \\"It is equally untrue that acting on the form and content of the message can convert the person receiving it.\\" In doing this Eco merges form and content, the separation of which is the basis of McLuhan's assertion. McLuhan does not offer a theory of communication. He instead investigates the effects of all media mediums between the human body and its physical environment, including language. =Others= The North American variant of media ecology is viewed by numerous theorists such as John Fekete and Neil Compton as meaningless or \\"McLuhanacy\\". According to Compton, it had been next to impossible to escape knowing about McLuhan and his theory as the media embraced them. Compton wrote, \\"it would be better for McLuhan if his oversimplifications did not happen to coincide with the pretensions of young status-hungry advertising executives and producers, who eagerly provide him with a ready-made claque, exposure on the media, and a substantial income from addresses and conventions.\\" Theorists such as Jonathan Miller claim that McLuhan used a subjective approach to make objective claims, comparing McLuhan's willingness to back away from a \\"probe\\" if he did not find the desired results to that of an objective scientist who would not abandon it so easily. These theorists against McLuhan's idea, such as Raymond Rosenthal, also believe that he lacked the scientific evidence to support his claims: \\"McLuhan's books are not scientific in any respect; they are wrapped however in the dark, mysterious folds of the scientific ideology.\\" Additionally, As Lance Strate said: \\"Other critics complain that media ecology scholars like McLuhan, Havelock, and Ong put forth a \\"Great Divide\\" theory, exaggerating, for example, the difference between orality and literacy, or the alphabet and hieroglyphics. Research  =New media= Many ecologists are using media ecology as an analytical framework, to explore whether the current new media has a \\"new\\" stranglehold on culture or are they simply extensions of what we have already experienced. The new media is characterised by the idea of web 2.0. It was coined in 2003 and popularized by a media consultant, Tim O'Reilly. He argues that a particular assemblage of software, hardware and sociality have brought about 'the widespread sense that there's something qualitatively different about today's Web. This shift is characterised by co-creativity, participation and openness, represented by software that support for example, wiki-based ways of creating and accessing knowledge, social networking sites, blogging, tagging and 'mash ups'. The interactive and user-oriented nature of these technologies have transformed the global culture into a participatory culture which proves Neil Postman's saying \\"technological change is not additive; it is ecological\\". As new media power takes on new dimension in the digital realm, some scholars begin to focus on defending the democratic potentialities of the Internet on the perspective of corporate impermeability. Today, corporate encroachment in cyberspace is changing the balance of power in the new media ecology, which \\"portends a new set of social relationships based on commercial exploitation\\". Many social network websites inject customized advertisements into the steady stream of personal communication. It is called commercial incursion which converts user-generated content into fodder for marketers and advertisers. So the control rests with the owners rather than the participants. It is necessary for online participants to be prepared to act consciously to resist the enclosure of digital commons. There is some recent research that puts the emphasis on the youth, the future of the society who is at the forefront of new media environment. Each generation, with its respective worldview, is equipped with certain media grammar and media literacy in its youth. As each generation inherits an idiosyncratic media structure, those born into the age of radio perceive the world differently from those born into the age of television. The nature of new generation is also influenced by the nature of the new media. According to the media ecology theory, analyzing today's generational identity through the lens of media technologies themselves can be more productive than focusing on media content. Media ecologists employ a media ecology interpretative framework to deconstruct how today's new media environment increasingly mirrors the values and character attributed to young people. Here are some typical characteristics of the new generation: first, it is \\"the world's first generation to grow up thinking of itself as global. The internet and satellite television networks are just two of the myriad technologies that have made this possible.\\" Second, \\"there may actually be no unified ethos\\". With \\"hundreds of cable channels and thousands of computer conferences, young generation might be able to isolate themselves within their own extremely opinionated forces\\". =Education= In 2009 a study was published by Cleora D'Arcy, Darin Eastburn and Bertram Bruce entitled \\"How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs\\". The purpose of this study was to use Media Ecology in order to determine which media is perceived as the most useful as an instructional tool in post-secondary education. This study specifically analyzed and tested \\"new media\\" such as podcasts, blogs, websites, and discussion forums with other media, such as traditional text books, lectures, and handouts. Ultimately comparing \\"hot\\" and \\"cold\\" media at today's standard of the terms. The result of the study, which included student surveys, indicated that a mixture of media was the most \\"valued\\" method of instruction, however more interactive media enhanced student learning. Application and case studies  There is significant research being done on the rise of social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and their influence on communication in society. Some of that research is being done through a media ecology perspective. Below are some examples: = Social media activism = While many people utilize social media platforms to stay in contact with friends and family, socialize, or even shop, these platforms have also been pivotal for social activism. Social media activism and hashtag activism have become popular ways to gain mainstream media and public attention for causes, and to facilitate protests. Thomas Poell researched the influence of social media on the 2010 protests of the Toronto G20 summit. In the article, he focused on identifying how each social media site was used independently, and then how they were integrated together. The sites analyzed were Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, Facebook, and an open publishing website. What he found is that each site is used differently for social media activism. While this kind of activism was originally looked at as a way to promote causes and encourage long term focus on the issues, Poell found that sites like Twitter and Facebook tend to do the opposite. Posts center around photographs and videos of action during protests and rallies, not on the issues that are being protested. This would be an example of hot media, because the user can scroll through photos or watch videos without being otherwise engaged, instead of cool media where the user has to be more involved. Additionally, because activists are using sites they do not own, the social media platform actually has more control over the information being posted. For example, Twitter no longer allows unrestricted access to all posts made with a certain hashtag after a period of time. This seems to mean that the issue being highlighted fades over time. Additionally, Heather Crandall and Carolyn M. Cunningham focus on hashtag activism, where activists use metadata tags to focus on specific issues (ex: #activism). They did not look at one specific protest like the G20 summit, but rather at the benefits and criticisms of hashtag activism as a whole. They discuss that social media is a new media ecology, one where users can connect and share ideas without boundaries. This falls under McLuhan's idea of the world as a global village. By using hashtags, activists are able to bring awareness to social issues. Crandall and Cunningham point out that this is both beautiful and interesting, because it encourages learning, conversations, and community for social justice, and that it is also dark and confusing, because the open environment of the internet also allows hashtags to be used for hate speech and threats of violence. Also, they posit that hashtag activism is pointed and stacked, in that hashtags are often short lived, and the user has to be able to navigate the platform and understand hashtags in order to gain knowledge of the issue. When viewed through media ecology, hashtag activism is changing the way people encounter and engage in social justice. = Case studies =  Arab Spring: Egypt and Iran  Mark Allen Peterson of in the Department of Anthropology at Miami University published an article in the Summer of 2011 comparing the media ecology of 1970s Iran to that in Egypt in 2011. The article, title \\"Egypt's Media Ecology in a Time of Revolution\\"Peterson, Mark Allen. \\"Egypt's media ecology in a time of revolution.\\" Arab media & society 13 (2011). looks at the difference that social media made in the Egyptian uprising and makes two observations: social media extends the \\"grapevine\\" network and that social media, despite the result of the uprising, completely changes the \\"mediascape\\" of Egypt. One dramatic difference between the two uprising noticed by Peterson is the ultimate position of the media of choice during each in the end. On the one hand, Iran's news media, the primary source of information at that time, reverted to its original role, while the Egyptian use of social media changed the media of choice for Egypt. Peterson's study compared his observations to that of William Beeman, who in 1984 published an essay, \\"The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after\\"Beeman, William O. \\"The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after.\\" The news media and national and international conflict (1984): 147–165. on the media ecology of Iran. Beeman's ultimate conclusion of his review of the Iranian Revolution followed that of what you would expect to find from most media ecologists: \\"At times newly introduced mass media have produced revolutionary effects in the societal management of time and energy as they forged new spaces for themselves. Thus media are cultural forces as well as cultural objects. In operation, they produce specific cultural effects that cannot be easily predicted.\\" Although there were many similarities between the Iranian Revolution and Egyptian revolutions, such as censorship in media, including newspaper and television, the one major difference was the availability of the internet and social media as a tool to spread messages and increase awareness in Egypt. Social media in 2011's uprising was equivalent to the use of cassette tapes in Iran in the 1970s. The tapes provided a way to spread information that could not be as easily censored and was repeatable through the country. The rise of social media helped free Egyptians from censorship of other media. In this case, the medium was the message, a message of freedom and by the Egyptian government's attempt to also censor this medium, they only managed to spread the message further and faster: > Although we may never know the true impact, in fact it likely sped up the > regime's fall. In the absence of new technologies, people were forced to > rely on traditional means of communication, including knocking on doors, > going to the mosque, assembling in the street, or other central gathering > places. Thomas Schelling won a Nobel prize in part for discovering that in > the absence of information, people will coordinate by selecting a focal > point that seems natural, special or relevant to them. Given the protests, > Tahrir Square was the obvious focal point. By blocking the Internet, the > government inadvertently fueled dissent and galvanized international support > for the people of Egypt. (Bowman 2011)Bowman, Warigia. 2011. Dictators and > the Internet. Cairo Review of Global Affairs. > http://www.aucegypt.edu/GAPP/CairoReview/Pages/articleDetails.aspx?aid=34 > [accessed November 14, 2013] Since 2011, leaders of the protest continue to utilize social media as a method to push democratic reform. According to Peterson the role of social media in Egypt is also evolving the political culture as even state figures are beginning to make announcements using social media rather than more traditional forms of media.  Gezi protests: Turkey  Much like the Arab Spring, the Gezi protests were an environmental sit-in that ultimately turned into a social movement based on the influence of various forms of social media. Rolien Hoyng and Murat Es coin the term \\"Turkish media ecology\\" to evoke a sense of particularly on the part of Turkey's relationship with media outlets and platforms. In Turkey, media censorship and control by state institutions most directly impact broadcast media. Both authors emphasize how \\"…media-ecological affordances are conditioned and modulated by legal frameworks and institutional-political rationalities\\". They also note that such censored media ecology forms a 'fertile milieu' for the proliferation of conspiracy theories which both feed on one another. Scholar Gulizar Haciyakupoglu examines how social media influenced the protests, specifically looking at how trust was built and maintained among protestors across multiple platforms. From his interviews, the scholar extrapolates that \\"closed groups\\" like Whatsapp and Facebook \\"...allowed the circulation of confidential and trustworthy information among first- and second-degree friends\\" whereas Twitter was used for \\"rapid acquisition of logistic information\\" that became important during the protest. 15M movement: Spain  Emiliano Treré looks to the media ecology metaphor as a way to investigate the relationship between social movements, media ecologies and communication technologies through the lens of Spain's anti-austerity movement, also called the \\"15M movement\\". Treré states how most scholars believe the media ecological framework is particularly suited for the study of the social movements/media nexus \\"...because of its ability to provide fine-tuned explorations of the multiplicity, the interconnections, the dynamic evolution of old and new media forms for social change\\". The author also agrees with Scolari (mentioned above) that the key reflections from the theory is especially beneficial for modern analysis on media and social events. One such application is seen with the analysis of Spain's 15M movement. Facing different degrees of mainstream media manipulation and bias \\"various media activists turned to Web TV services, radical online tools, Twitter and Facebook among others to organize, and contrast the official narratives of the protest.\\" Scholar John Postill argues that Twitter, among all the types of technologies used, produced a greater effect for setting and tone and agenda of the movement. Such appropriation of technologies demonstrates the dichotomies between old and new technologies that in term created a kind of \\"technological sovereignty\\" among activists. Media ecology has the innate ability to aggregate different analytical approaches to better understand the technology that is at place during such a protest. Postill and other scholars ultimately look to a new age in social activism, where \\"viral\\" posts shared by media professionals and amateurs empower people and become the rising voice for the future of democracy in Spain.

Reared in a family of committed communists, Michnik became an opponent of Poland's communist regime at the time of the party's anti-Jewish purges. He was imprisoned after the 1968 March Events and again after the imposition of martial law in 1981. Michnik played a crucial role during the Polish Round Table Talks, as a result of which the communists agreed to call elections in 1989, which were won by Solidarity. Though he has withdrawn from active politics, he has \\"maintained an influential voice through journalism\\".Judt, Tony, Postwar; A History of Europe since 1945, p.694 He has received many awards and honors, including the Legion of Honour and European of the Year. He is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders.https://rsf.org/en/adam-michnik Family Adam Michnik was born in Warsaw, Poland, to a family of Jewish communists. His father Ozjasz Szechter was First Secretary of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, and his mother Helena Michnik was a historian, communist activist, and children's-book author. His step-brother on his mother's side, Stefan Michnik, was a Stalinist military judge in the 1950s, who passed sentence, including executions, in politically-motivated trials of members of Polish anti-Nazi resistance fighters. Stefan Michnik (who has lived in Sweden since 1968), was later formally implicated in zbrodnie komunistyczne (\\"communist crimes\\") by Polish courts. A step-brother of Adam Michnik on his father's side, Jerzy Michnik (born 1929), settled in Israel after 1957 and then moved to New York. Education While attending primary school, he was an active member of the Polish Scouting Association (ZHP), in a troop which was led by Jacek Kuroń. During secondary school, this particular Scouting troop was banned, and Adam began to participate in meetings of the Crooked Circle Club. After its closing in 1962, with the encouragement from Jan Józef Lipski and under Adam Schaff's protection, he founded a discussion group, \\"Contradiction Hunters Club\\" (Klub Poszukiwaczy Sprzeczności); he was one and the most visible leader of the left wing student opposition group, the Komandosi. In 1964, he began to study history at Warsaw University. A year later he was suspended because he disseminated an open letter to the members of Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) among his schoolmates. Its authors, Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski appealed for a beginning of reforms which would repair the political system in Poland. In 1965, the PZPR forbade the printing of his works. In 1966, he was suspended for the second time for organizing a discussion meeting with Leszek Kołakowski, who was expelled from the PZPR several weeks earlier, for criticizing its leaders. From then on, he wrote under a pseudonym to several newspapers including \\"Życie Gospodarcze\\", \\"Więź\\", and \\"Literatura\\". In March 1968, he was expelled from the University for his activities during 1968 Polish political crisis. The crisis was ignited by the ban of Kazimierz Dejmek's adaptation of Adam Mickiewicz's poetic drama Dziady (\\"Forefathers' Eve\\") in the National Theatre. The play contained many anti-Russian allusions, which were greeted with enthusiastic applause by the audience. Michnik and another student, Henryk Szlajfer, recounted the situation to a correspondent of Le Monde, \\"whose report was then carried on Radio Free Europe\\".Judt, Tony, Postwar; A History of Europe since 1945, p. 433 Both Michnik and Szlajfer were expelled from the university. Upon their expulsion, students organized demonstrations, which were brutally suppressed by the riot police and \\"worker- squads\\". Władysław Gomułka used Michnik's and several other dissidents' Jewish background to wage an anti-Semitic campaign, blaming the Jews for the crisis. Michnik was arrested and sentenced to three years imprisonment for \\"acts of hooliganism\\". In 1969, he was released from prison under an amnesty, but he was forbidden to continue his studies. Not until the middle of the 1970s was he allowed to continue his studies of history, which he finished in 1975 at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, under the supervision of Prof. Lech Trzeciakowski. Opposition After he was released from prison, he worked for two years as a welder at the Róża Luxemburg (Rosa Luxemburg) Industrial Plant and then, on the recommendation of Jacek Kuroń, he became private secretary to Antoni Słonimski. In 1976–77 he lived in Paris. After he returned to Poland, he became involved in the activity of Workers' Defence Committee (KOR), which had already existed for a couple of months. It was one of the best known opposition organizations of the 1970s. He became one of the most active opposition activists and also one of the supporters of the Society for Educational Courses (Towarzystwo Kursów Naukowych). Between 1977 and 1989, he was the editor or co-editor of underground newspapers published illegally, samizdat: Biuletyn Informacyjny, Zapis, and Krytyka. He was also a member of the management of one of the biggest underground publishers: NOWa. In years 1980–1989, he was an adviser to both the Independent Self-governing trade union \\"Solidarity\\" (NSZZ \\"Solidarność\\") in the Mazovia Region and to Foundry Workers Committee of \\"Solidarity\\". When martial law was declared in December 1981, he was an internee at first, but when he refused to sign a \\"loyalty oath\\" and assent to voluntarily leave the country, he was jailed and accused of an \\"attempt to overthrow socialism\\". He was in jail without a verdict until 1984 because the prosecutor's office deliberately prolonged the trial. Adam Michnik demanded an end to the judicial proceedings against him or have his case dismissed. Meanwhile, he wanted to be granted the status of a political prisoner, and began a hunger strike while in jail. In 1984, he was released from jail, under an amnesty. He took part in an attempt to organize a strike in the Gdańsk shipyard. As a consequence, he was rearrested in 1985 and this time sentenced to three years imprisonment. He was released the following year, again under another amnesty. Since 1989 In 1988, he became an adviser of Lech Wałęsa's informal Coordination Committee, and later he became a member of the Solidarity Citizens' Committee. He took an active part in planning and preliminary negotiations for the Round Table Talks in 1989, in which he also participated. Adam Michnik inspired and collaborated with the editors of the Ulam Quarterly, before 1989 that journal pioneered the World Wide Web in the USA. After the Round Table Talks, Lech Wałęsa told him to organize a big Polish national daily, which was supposed to be an 'organ' of the Solidarity Citizens' Committee, before the upcoming elections. This newspaper, under the Round Table agreement, was Gazeta Wyborcza (\\"Election Newspaper\\") because it was supposed to appear until the end of the parliamentary election in 1989. After organizing this newspaper with journalists who worked in the \\"Biuletyn Informacyjny\\", Adam Michnik became its editor-in-chief. In the elections to the Contract Sejm on 4 June 1989 he became a member of parliament for Lech Wałęsa's Solidarity Citizens' Committee electoral register, as a candidate for the city of Bytom. Adam Michnik in 1991 Both as a member of parliament and as editor of Gazeta Wyborcza he actively supported Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's government and his candidature in the 1990 presidential election campaign against Lech Wałęsa. After the breakup of the Citizens' Committee and Mazowiecki's failure, Michnik withdrew from his direct involvement in politics and did not run for a seat in the 1991 parliamentary election, instead focusing on editorial and journalistic activities. Under his leadership, Gazeta Wyborcza was converted into an influential left-wing daily newspaper in Poland. Based on Gazeta Wyborcza assets, the Agora SA partnership came into existence. By May 2004, it was one of the biggest media concerns in Poland, administrating 11 monthly titles, the portal gazeta.pl, the outdoor advertising company AMS, and has shares in several radio stations. Adam Michnik does not have any shares in Agora and does not hold any office, other than chief editor, which is unusual in business in Poland. Michnik's shares are kept by Agora. Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in his exposé in September 1989 began a new, so-called broad- stroke, attitude to political history of the recent past. He is proponent and advocate of this term. In Gazeta Wyborcza he used his personal influence to protect General Wojciech Jaruzelski and General Czesław Kiszczak from being prosecuted for various crimes committed by Jaruzelski and Kiszczak during their time running the People's Republic of Poland (PRL). He gave an interview arguing the same which was published under the title Pożegnanie z bronią. Adam Michnik- Czesław Kiszczak by Agnieszka Kublik and Monika Olejnik which was published in Gazeta Wyborcza on 3 February 2001. On 27 December 2002, Adam Michnik and Paweł Smoleński revealed the so-called \\"Rywin affair\\" which had to be explained by a specially called parliamentary select committee. In autumn 2004, due to health problems (he suffered from tuberculosis) he resigned from active participation in editing Gazeta Wyborcza and passed his duties to editorial colleague Helena Łuczywo. On the anniversary of the introduction of martial law, on 13 December 2005, Michnik delivered an exposition at the University of Warsaw (an article was published in the Gazeta Wyborcza) in which he appealed to president Lech Kaczyński for statutory abolition for those who were responsible for the martial law. The article was a response to information about instituting an inquiry by Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) against General Jaruzelski. Michnik appealed about abolition even earlier – in 1991 (during an exposition at the Faculty of Law at University of Maria Curie-Skłodowska in Lublin (UMCS), \\"Gazeta w Lublinie\\" 11 December 1991) and also in 2001 in the article \\"Stan wojenny 20 lat później\\" (\\"Gazeta Wyborcza\\" 12 December 2001). He has taken various positions of support for the former Communist secret police officers, against the Catholic Church and against various post-Communist opposition parties. He has remained a supporter of the moderate Platforma Obywatelska and, upon the election to the Presidency of Poland of the opposition Pis candidate Andrzej Duda on 24 May 2015, published an article claiming that Poland was on the path to dictatorship. He is a member of the Association of Polish Writers and the Council on Foreign Relations. Controversies While Michnik's contribution in abolishing communism in Poland is widely acknowledged and valued, there has been observed a phenomenon of strong hostility or even hatred since the mid-1990s, mainly from the Polish right, for two reasons. Firstly, Michnik's views concerning lustration, a heated political issue in the 1990s in Poland, the purging from the public life of people involved in the communist system, roused controversy. Michnik opposed lustration and, as his detractors argue, used the influence exerted by Gazeta Wyborcza to persuade the public. Secondly, Michnik's newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza combated the nationalistic slant of Polish clergy and spotlighted incidents of sexual abuse perpetrated by the clergy, which was interpreted by those still strongly attached to the Catholicism as an assault on the Church and so alienated a large section of the population.

They vary greatly in size, form, and material of construction, and have been in use since ancient times throughout the world. They may consist of simple earthenware bowls or fire pots to intricately carved silver or gold vessels, small table top objects a few centimetres tall to as many as several metres high. Many designs use openwork to allow a flow of air. In many cultures, burning incense has spiritual and religious connotations, and this influences the design and decoration of the censer. Often, especially in Western contexts, \\"censer\\" is used for pieces made for religious use, especially those on chains that are swung through the air to spread the incense smoke widely, while \\"perfume burner\\" is used for objects made for secular use. The original meaning of pastille was a small compressed mixture of aromatic plant material and charcoal that was lit to release the odour, and pastille-burners were designed for this, for use in the home. Pastilles were made at home until their heyday in the early 19th century, and the burners are often made in pottery or porcelain.The Regency Redingote, October, 2013 Some types could also be used as pomanders, where the perfume diffuses slowly by evaporation rather than burning.Piotrovsky M.B. and Rogers, J.M. (eds), Heaven on Earth: Art from Islamic Lands, p. 87, 2004, Prestel, Use Russian church, late 15th-early 16th century, silver, total height: 27.5 cm, width: 10.5 cm, the Moscow Kremlin Museums (Moscow, Russia) For direct-burning incense, pieces of the incense are burned by placing them directly on top of a heat source or on a hot metal plate in a censer or thurible. Indirect-burning incense, also called \\"non-combustible incense\\", is a combination of aromatic ingredients that are not prepared in any particular way or encouraged into any particular form, leaving it mostly unsuitable for direct combustion. The use of this class of incense requires a separate heat source since it does not generally kindle a fire capable of burning itself and may not ignite at all under normal conditions. This incense can vary in the duration of its burning with the texture of the material. Finer ingredients tend to burn more rapidly, while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually as they have less total surface area. The heat is traditionally provided by charcoal or glowing embers. For home use of granulated incense, small, concave charcoal briquettes are sold. One lights the corner of the briquette on fire, then places it in the censer and extinguishes the flame. After the glowing sparks traverse the entire briquette, it is ready to have incense placed on it. For direct-burning incense, the tip or end of the incense is ignited with a flame or other heat source until the incense begins to turn into ash at the burning end. Flames on the incense are then fanned or blown out, with the incense continuing to burn without a flame on its own. Censers made for stick incense are also available; these are simply a long, thin plate of wood, metal, or ceramic, bent up and perforated at one end to hold the incense. They serve to catch the ash of the burning incense stick. In Taoist and Buddhist temples, the inner spaces are scented with thick coiled incense, which are either hung from the ceiling or on special stands. Worshipers at the temples light and burn sticks of incense. Individual sticks of incense are then vertically placed into individual censers. Chinese use A Qing Dynasty qilin-shaped incense burner Incense burner set from Japan's Edo period, 17th century Kakiemon ware, Walters Art Museum The earliest vessels identified as censers date to the mid-fifth to late fourth centuries BCE during the Warring States period. The modern Chinese term for \\"censer,\\" xianglu (香爐, \\"incense burner\\"), is a compound of xiang (\\"incense, aromatics\\") and lu (爐, \\"brazier; stove; furnace\\"). Another common term is xunlu (熏爐, \\"a brazier for fumigating and perfuming\\"). Early Chinese censer designs, often crafted as a round, single-footed stemmed basin, are believed to have derived from earlier ritual bronzes, such as the dou 豆 sacrificial chalice. Among the most celebrated early incense burner designs is the hill censer (boshanlu 博山爐), a form that became popular during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE). Some scholars believe hill censers depict a sacred mountain, such as Mount Kunlun or Mount Penglai. These elaborate vessels were designed with apertures that made rising incense smoke appear like clouds or mist swirling around a mountain peak.Erickson, Susan N. (1992). \\"Boshanlu: Mountain Censers of the Western Han Period: A Typological and Iconological Analysis\\", Archives of Asian Art 45:6-28. The Han Dynasty scholar Liu Xiang (77–6 BCE) composed an inscription describing a hill censer: > I value this perfect utensil, lofty and steep as a mountain! Its top is like > Hua Shan in yet its foot is a bronze plate. It contains rare perfumes, red > flames and green smoke; densely ornamented are its sides, and its summit > joins azure heaven. A myriad animals are depicted on it. Ah, from it sides I > can see ever further than Li Lou [who had legendary eyesight].Needham, > Joseph and Lu Gwei-Djen (1974). Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, > Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 2, Spagyrical Discovery and > Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality. Cambridge University Press. > p. 133. Another popular design was the small \\"scenting globe\\" (xiangqiu 香球), a device similar to a pomander, but used for burning incense. The famed inventor and craftsmen, Ding Huan (1st c. BCE), is believed to have made these with gimbal supports so the censer could easily be used to fumigate or scent garments. This is described by Edward H. Schafer: > \\"Censing baskets\\" were globes of hollow metal, pierced with intricate floral > or animal designs; within the globe, an iron cup, suspended on gimbals, > contained the burning incense. They were used to perfume garments and > bedclothes, and even to kill insects.Schafer, Edward H. (1963). The Golden > Peaches of Samarkand, a Study of T'ang Exotics. University of California > Press. p. 155. Other Chinese censers are shaped like birds or animals, sometimes designed so that the incense smoke would issue from the mouth. During the medieval period when censers were more commonly used in Buddhist and Daoist rituals, hand-held censers (shoulu 手爐) fashioned with long handles were developed. Archeologists have excavated several censers from Han era tombs that contained aromatics or ashen remains. Some of these aromatic plants have been identified as maoxiang (茅香 \\"Imperata cylindrica, thatch grass\\"), gaoliangjiang (高良薑 \\"Galangal\\"), xinyi (辛夷 \\"Magnolia liliiflora, Mulan magnolia), and gaoben (藁本\\"Ligusticum sinense, Chinese lovage\\"). Scholars speculate burning these grasses \\"may have facilitated communication with spirits\\" during funeral ceremonies.Erickson (1992), p. 15. According to the Sinologist and historian Joseph Needham, some early Daoists adapted censers for the religious and spiritual use of cannabis. The Daoist encyclopedia Wushang Biyao (無上秘要 \\"Supreme Secret Essentials\\", ca. 570 CE), recorded adding cannabis into ritual censers.Needham and Lu (1974), p. 150. The Shangqing School of Daoism provides a good example. The Shangqing scriptures were written by Yang Xi (330– c. 386 CE) during alleged visitations by Daoist \\"immortals\\", and Needham believed Yang was \\"aided almost certainly by cannabis\\".Needham and Lu (1974), p. 151. Tao Hongjing (456-536 CE), who edited the official Shangqing canon, also compiled the Mingyi bielu (名醫別錄 \\"Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians\\"). It noted that mabo (麻勃 \\"cannabis flowers\\"), \\"are very little used in medicine, but the magician- technicians ([shujia] 術家) say that if one consumes them with ginseng it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future.\\" Needham concluded, > Thus all in all there is much reason for thinking that the ancient Taoists > experimented systematically with hallucinogenic smokes, using techniques > which arose directly out of liturgical observance. … At all events the > incense-burner remained the centre of changes and transformations associated > with worship, sacrifice, ascending perfume of sweet savour, fire, > combustion, disintegration, transformation, vision, communication with > spiritual beings, and assurances of immortality. Wai tan and nei tan met > around the incense-burner. Might one not indeed think of it as their point > of origin?Needham and Lu (1974), p. 154. These Waidan (外丹 \\"outer alchemy\\") and neidan (內丹 \\"inner alchemy\\") are the primary divisions of Chinese alchemy. During the T’ang period, incense was used by upper class people for personal hygiene, romantic rendezvous, and deodorizing the interior of edifices. These included places of worship, dwellings, and work-spaces. Dating back to the seventh century AD, the kuanhuo(changing of fire) ceremony took place, where people would cleanse their homes with incense. However, in some parts of East Asia, incense burners were used as a way to tell time In the Far East, incense was used as a way to tell time because it was a simple mechanism and generally not a fire hazard. Time increments were marked off on each incense stick to show how much time had passed, then placed in a ritual tripod vessel known as a ting. During imperial coronations, incense sticks would be used to tell how long the ceremony was. Other variations of incense is the spiral incense coil. The spiral incense coil was used to measure time for longer durations. One spiral equated to one night. This type of incense was mainly used by the five ‘night watches’ of the community. The length of their shifts and breaks were determined by the time increments marked off on the spirals.Bedini, Silvio A. The Trail of Time = Shih-Chien Ti Tsu-Chi : Time Measurement with Incense in East Asia . Cambridge ;: Cambridge University Press, 1994. Print. Middle East Khorasan or Central Asia Incense burners (miqtarah in Arabic) were used in both religious and secular contexts, but were more widely utilized in palaces and houses. The earliest known examples of dish-shaped incense burners with zoomorphic designs were excavated in Ghanza, while the earliest examples of zoomorphic incense burners are from 11th-century Tajikistan.Piotrovsky M.B. and Rogers, J.M. (eds), Heaven on Earth: Art from Islamic Lands, pp 86-87, 2004, Prestel, It is most likely that this practice was inspired by Hellenistic style incense burners as well as the frankincense trade present in the Arabian peninsula since the 8th century BCE. Incense Burner of Amir Saif al-Dunya wa’l-Din ibn Muhammad al-Mawardi, 12th century, alt=Source of photo: The Metropolitan Museum of Art A wide variety of designs were used at different times and in different areas. Pottery and stone incense burners were the most common while those made of metals were reserved for the wealthy. Artisans created these incense burners with moulds or the lost-wax method. Openwork zoomorphic incense burners with lynx or lion designs were popular in the Islamic world; bronze or brass examples are found from the 11th-century until the Mongol conquests of the 13th-century. These were especially popular during the Seljuq period. The extensive use of lynx shape incense burners was due to the animals popularity as a hunting animal and as pet in Muslim courts. The complexity of the piece would also make it fit into a palatial setting. This style of incense burners could measure about 22 cm; others like an example in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York measures 85 cm. The surface of the object would be decorated with bands of Arabic calligraphy which would imitate a tiraz. This bands of text could include the name of the artist and the patron as well as prayers and good wishes for the owner. To insert coals and incense the head would be removed; the openwork geometric design would then allow the scented smoke to escape. Depending on the size, the incense burner could be either carried on a tray or carried by using the tail as a handle. In mosques, incense burners do not have a liturgical use or a specific design denoted for religious context. However, they are still an important part of rituals and weddings. Other religious groups in Middle East such as the Copts do have ceremonial uses for incense burners. Japan Koro (Japanese: 香炉, kōro), also a Chinese term, is a Japanese censer often used in Japanese tea ceremonies. Examples are usually of globular form with three feet, made in pottery, Imari porcelain, Kutani ware, Kakiemon, Satsuma, enamel or bronze. In Japan a similar censer called a is used by several Buddhist sects. The egōro is usually made of brass with a long handle and no chain. Instead of charcoal, makkō powder is poured into a depression made in a bed of ash. The makkō is lit and the incense mixture is burned on top. This method is known as Sonae-kō (Religious Burning). Mesoamerica Teotihuacan censer lid. Museo de América, Madrid Used domestically and ceremonially in Mesoamerica, particularly in the large Central-Mexican city of Teotihuacan (100–600 AD) and in the many kingdoms belonging to the Maya civilization, were ceramic incense burners. The most common materials for construction were Adobe, plumbate,Bruhns, Karen Olsen. “Plumbate Origins Revisited.” American Antiquity, vol. 45, no. 04, 1980, pp. 845–848., doi:10.2307/280154. and earthenware. These materials can be dried by the sun and were locally sourced, making them the perfect material for a Mayan craftsman. Censers vary in decoration. Some are painted using a fresco style technique or decorated with adornos,Feinman, Gary M., and Dorie Reents-Budet. \\"Painting the Maya Universe: Royal Ceramics of the Classic Period.\\" The Hispanic American Historical Review 75, no. 3 (1995): 457. doi:10.2307/2517243. or small ceramic ornaments. These decorations usually depicted shells, beads, butterflies, flowers, and other symbols with religious significance that could to increase rainfall, agricultural abundance, fertility, wealth, good fortune or ease the transition of souls into the underworld.Morehart, Christopher T., Abigail Meza Peñaloza, Carlos Serrano Sánchez, Emily Mcclung De Tapia, and Emilio Ibarra Morales. \\"Human Sacrifice During the Epiclassic Period in the Northern Basin of Mexico.\\" Latin American Antiquity 23, no. 04 (2012): 426-48. doi:10.7183/1045-6635.23.4.426.

Used to communicate with the Gods, these censers functioned for acts of religious purification. Incense would be presented to the divine being. In fact, some people were appointed the position of fire priest. Fire priests dealt with most tasks related to incense burning. Some rituals involved a feast, which would be followed by the fire priest igniting a sacred brazier in the temples. It was given to the divine beings and deities as offerings on a daily basis. The practice would end at the sound of a trumpet made from a conch shell. Another function of incense was to heal the sick. Once recuperated, the diseased would present some incense to the appropriate gods to repay them for being cured.Culler, Judith L. Incense Burners. Gettysburg Pa: Gettysburg College/Gettysburg Pa., 1961. Print.Made up of copal (tree resin), rubber, pine, herbs, myrrh, and chewing gum, the incense produced what was described as \\"the odor of the center of heaven.\\"Coe, Michael D. The Maya, Seventh Edition. 2005. The shape of incense burners in the Maya southern lowlands reflected religious and cultural changes over time. Some censers were used in funerals and funerary rituals, such as those depicting the Underworld Jaguar or the Night Sun God. When a king would die, ‘termination rituals’ were practiced. During these rituals, incensarios would be smashed and older temples were replaced with new ones.Rice, P.M. 1999, ‘Rethinking Classic lowland Maya pottery censers’, Ancient Mesoamerica, vol. 10, no.1, pp.25-50.Mayan censers, which had a reservoir for incense on top of a vertical shaft were highly elaborate during the Classic period (600–900 AD), particularly in the kingdom of Palenque, and usually show the head of a Mayan deity. In Post-Classic Yucatán, particularly in the capital of the kingdom of Mayapan, censers were found in great numbers, often shaped as an aged priest or deity. Craftsmen produced Mayan censers in many sizes, some just a few inches in height, others, several feet tall. Christian use Orthodox priest with hand censer =Eastern churches= Chain censer In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches, censers (Greek: thymiateria) are similar in design to the Western thurible. This fourth chain passes through a hole the hasp and slides in order to easily raise the lid. There will often be 12 small bells attached to the chains, symbolising the preaching of the Twelve Apostles, where one of the bells has been silenced to symbolize the rebel Judas.Herrera, Matthew D. Holy Smoke: The Use of Incense in the Catholic Church . San Luis Obispo: Tixlini Scriptorium, 2011. In some traditions the censer with bells is normally used only by a bishop. Before a deacon begins a censing, he will take the censer to the priest (or the bishop, if he is present) for a blessing. The censers, charcoal and incense are kept in the diaconicon (sacristy) Entrance with the censer at Great Vespers. The censer is used much more frequently in the Eastern churches: typically at every vespers, matins, and Divine Liturgy, as well as pannikhidas (memorial services), and other occasional offices. If a deacon is present, he typically does much of the censing; otherwise, the priest will perform the censing. Unordained servers or acolytes are permitted to prepare and carry the censer, but may not swing it during prayers. Liturgical Censing is the practice of swinging a censer suspended from chains towards something or someone, typically an icon or person, so that smoke from the burning incense travels in that direction. Burning incense represents the prayers of the church rising towards Heaven. One commonly sung psalm during the censing is \\"Let my prayer arise in Thy sight as incense, and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.\\"Psalm 141:2, New International Version When a deacon or priest performs a full censing of the temple (church building), he will often say Psalm 51 quietly to himself. Hand censer In addition to the chain censer described above, a \\"hand censer\\" (Greek: Κατσί katzi or katzion) is used on certain occasions. This device has no chains and consists of a bowl attached to a handle, often with bells attached. The lid is normally attached to the bowl with a hinge. In Greek practice, particularly as observed on Mount Athos, during the portion of Vespers known as \\"Lord, I cry unto Thee\\" the ecclesiarch (sacristan) and his assistant will perform a full censing of the temple and people using hand censers. Some churches have the practice of not using the chain censer during Holy Week, even by a priest or bishop, substituting for it the hand censer as a sign of humility, repentance and mourning over the Passion of Christ. They return to using the chain censer just before the Gospel reading at the Divine Liturgy on Great Saturday. Some Orthodox Christians use a standing censer on their icon corner (home altar). =Western churches= Censer used during Mass In the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church and some other groups, the censer is often called a thurible, and used during important offices (benedictions, processions, and important Masses). A common design for a thurible is a metal container, about the size and shape of a coffee-pot, suspended on chains. The bowl contains hot coals, and the incense is placed on top of these. The thurible is then swung back and forth on its chains, spreading the fragrant smoke. A famous thurible is the Botafumeiro, in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Suspended from the ceiling of the cathedral, the swinging of this high, 55 kilogram silver vessel is an impressive sight. One of the explanations for the great size of the Botafumeiro is that in the early days it was used to freshen the air in the cathedral after being visited by droves of travel-weary pilgrims. It was also once believed that the incense smoke guarded against contracting the many diseases that plagued the populace in past centuries. Some thuribles were based on an architectural motif, for example the Gozbert Censer from the Cathedral of Trier inspired by the Temple of Solomon.  Hindu use  Hindus have traditionally used an earthen censer called a Dhunachi for burning incense with coal, though coconut husk is also used. The vessel has a flared shape with a curved handle and an open top. There are also brass and silver versions.  Gallery  File:Incense burner from Assur, Iraq. Circa 2400 BC.

Although Iranian authorities insist that her death was accidental and that she died of a stroke while being interrogated, Shahram Azam, a former military staff physician who used his purported knowledge of Kazemi's case for seeking asylum in Canada in 2004, has stated that he examined Kazemi's body and observed that Kazemi showed obvious signs of torture, including a skull fracture, broken nose, signs of rape and severe abdominal bruising.INDEPTH: ZAHRA KAZEMI \\"Iran's changing story\\" CBC News Online  Updated 16 November 2005 Retrieved 15/03/08 Her death was the first time an Iranian's death in custody attracted major international attention.Ebadi, Shirin, Iran Awakening, by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House New York, 2006, p.199 Because of her dual citizenship and the circumstances of her death, she has since become an international cause célèbre. In November 2003, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression honoured Kazemi with the Tara Singh Hayer Memorial Award in recognition of her courage in defending the right to free expression.Memorial Award November 2003 , cjfe.org Life and death Kazemi was born in Shiraz, Iran and moved to France in 1974 to study literature and cinema at the University of Paris. With her son, Stephan Hachemi, she immigrated to Montreal Quebec, Canada in 1993, where she later gained dual citizenship as an Iranian and Canadian national. She worked in Africa, Latin- America and the Caribbean and then more frequently in various Middle Eastern countries, including the Palestinian territories, Iraq and Afghanistan. She visited the latter two countries both prior and during the US occupation. Immediately prior to her travelling to Iran, Kazemi revisited Iraq, documenting the American occupation. Recurrent themes in her work were the documentation of poverty, destitution, forced exile and oppression, and also the strength of women in these situations. =Arrest= Evin House of Detention, where Kazemi was arrested and held Traveling back to her birth country using her Iranian passport, Kazemi was allowed into Iran to take photographs of the possible demonstrations that were expected to take place in Tehran in July 2003. The demonstrations took place and were effectively crushed after the sixth day by a massive deployment of security forces and paramilitary vigilantes, or \\"plainclothesmen.\\" Following the clampdown, an estimated 4000 students \\"had gone missing\\" and were thought to have been arrested for protesting and taken to Evin prison, Tehran's political prisoner detention facility. As was customary after such events, family members of the missing gathered outside of Evin prison in north of Tehran in hopes of learning what had happened to their children. On 23 June 2003, Kazemi drove to the prison to take pictures of these family members, possessing a government- issued press card that she thought made it permissible for her to work around Tehran, including at Evin. According to Shirin Ebadi – an Iranian lawyer and former judge who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, and later became the main representative of Kazemi's family at the trial over Kazemi's death – when a prison staff member saw Kazemi taking photographs he demanded that she give him her camera, as photography is prohibited in front of the prison. > Worried that officials might harass the families whose photos she had > already taken, she flashed her press card and exposed the film to the light. > The guard angrily yelled at her, ‘I didn't ask you to expose your film, I > told you to give me your camera’ ‘You can have the camera’, she retorted, > ‘but the film belongs to me.’ She was detained, and was interrogated over > the next three days by police officers, prosecutors and intelligence > officials.Ebadi, Iran Awakening, (2006), pp. 195–7 The Evin prison staff, whom the Kazemi family's lawyers consider a party in the beatings that led to Kazemi's death, say that she had been in a sensitive area, photographing parts of the prison. Several days after her arrest, hardline newspapers ran stories of her arrest \\"calling her a spy who had entered the country undercover as a journalist.\\" Kazemi insisted that she did not photograph any part of the prison, only the street and the demonstrators, who were family members of activist students jailed in the prison. =Death= On 11 July 2003, nineteen days after she was arrested, Kazemi died in Iranian custody in Baghiyyatollah al-Azam Military Hospital. Two days later, Iran's official IRNA news agency reported that Kazemi had suffered a stroke while she was being interrogated and died in hospital. This account changed to one that Kazemi had died after falling and hitting her head. On 16 July 2003, Iran's vice-president, Mohammad Ali Abtahi, \\"conceded that Kazemi died as a result of being beaten\\". Mohammad Ali Abtahi (Vice President of Legal Affairs) and Masoud Pezeshkian (Minister of Health and Medical Education) admitted that she died of a fractured skull as a result of being hit in the head. Abtahi claims that he was under a lot of pressure to take back the acknowledgement, but he resisted it. Shirin Ebadi reports that security officials searched the house of an unnamed friend that Kazemi had been staying at, and \\"kept asking\\" her friend about Kazemi's \\"‘medical condition’ and what medicines she took daily.\\" Officials also kept Kazemi's elderly, frail mother who had journeyed from Shiraz to see her only child, from seeing Kazemi until they had questioned her about what the medicines they insisted her daughter must be using. Kazemi's friend told Ebadi that she later realized this meant Kazemi was dead and the officials \\"wanted to claim that Ziba had a preexisting condition that had simply worsened in prison.\\" The story did not become a major controversy until almost two years later, when Shahram Azam, a former staff physician in Iran's Defence Ministry, released a statement saying that he examined Kazemi in hospital four days after her arrest and found obvious signs of torture, including: > *Evidence of a very brutal rape *A skull fracture, two broken fingers, > missing fingernails, a crushed big toe and a broken nose. *Severe abdominal > bruising, swelling behind the head and a bruised shoulder. *Deep scratches > on the neck and evidence of flogging on the legs. One of the two Iranian intelligence agents charged with her death was acquitted in September 2003. The other agent, Mohammed Reza Aghdam-Ahmadi (محمدرضا اقدم احمدی), was charged with \\"semi-intentional murder\\" and his trial opened in Tehran in October 2003. In the same month, the Iranian parliament condemned Saeed Mortazavi, a Tehran prosecutor, for announcing that Kazemi had died of a stroke. On 25 July 2004, Aghdam-Ahmadi was acquitted. Murder trial Shirin Ebadi was the main representative of Kazemi's family at the trial, and represented them at the second and third sessions of Aghdam- Ahmadi's trial, which took place on 17–18 July 2004. In the court, Kazemi's mother mentioned that she wanted the real murderer to be prosecuted. She also mentioned that she saw Kazemi's body before the burial, upon which there were signs of torture. Ebadi and the other lawyers of the family insisted in the court that they know that Kazemi was not killed by Aghdam-Ahmadi, and they need witnesses to be brought to the court to find the real murderer, who they guessed may be Mohammad Bakhshi, a high officer of the Evin prison. The list of witnesses they requested included Saeed Mortazavi, the general prosecutor of Tehran, Mohsen Armin, reformist member of the previous parliament , Jamileh Kadivar, and Mohsen Mirdamadi, Minister of Intelligence Ali Younesi, the Vice President of Legal Affairs Mohammad Ali Abtahi, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ahmad Masjedjamei, the five judges who were present during Kazemi's interrogation, a few employees of the Evin prison, the president of the Baghiyyatollah hospital, and all of the medical staff who had signed her file. Judge Farahani denied all of the requests. The lawyers also quoted the official report of death that various parts of Kazemi's body had been damaged and her clothes were torn and bloody, which proves that she had been tortured. On 14 July 2004, the Iranian government rejected requests for Canadian government observers to attend the trial, despite promises and assurances by the Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and judiciary officials to the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Bill Graham. The same day, Graham recalled the ambassador at Tehran, Philip MacKinnon. MacKinnon, together with the Dutch ambassador (representing the European Union) and diplomats from the British and French embassies, were later allowed to attend the 17 July trial, though not the 18 July one. Judge Farahani was quoted on 18 July as saying that \\"(he) made a mistake yesterday. The bar is to show the world that Iran won't bow under pressure.\\" Hamid Reza Assefi, the spokesman for the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said \\"We hadn't permitted an observer from the beginning. But you should ask the reason for the ban from the court, there may have been a shortage of seats.\\" Assefi also said that since Iran does not recognize dual nationality and Kazemi was an Iranian citizen who entered the country under an Iranian passport, never having requested her citizenship to be removed, that the case was clearly an internal affair. The trial sessions ended on 18 July, with the lawyers of the Kazemi family insisting that the time had not been enough for proofs to be given, witnesses to be brought to court, and the murderer to be identified. They also mentioned that the court didn't pay attention to their evidence. They refused to sign the session notes. The Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister, Bill Graham, defined these events as \\"flagrant denial of due process\\". On 24 July 2003, Judge Farahani issued his judgment, clearing Aghdam-Ahmadi of the charges. He also mentioned that since the murderer has not been found, according to the Islamic sources the blood money should be paid by the government to the family. The lawyers of Kazemi's family announced that they will appeal the case, asking for a criminal court to be established to reconsider the whole case, or completing the numerous incompletenesses of the file. They also mentioned that if the family asks, they will bring the case to the international authorities, mentioning Iran's 1954 signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The end of July saw Iran's judiciary adding \\"accidental fall\\" and \\"hunger strike\\" to the list of alleged causes for Kazemi's death. They claimed that Kazemi had gone on a hunger strike voluntarily, developed low blood pressure that made her dizzy, fell, and hit her head. Detractors point out that this story does not explain her broken bones, genital injuries or skin lacerations.

This appointment is immediately fiercely attacked by pro-reformist Iranian MPs, as Mortazavi had himself been accused of failing to prevent Kazemi's death, and was widely believed to be behind a recent wave of arrests of writers and journalists. Given this controversy, the investigation appeared unlikely to mollify Canada, which was growing increasingly impatient with Iran's unwillingness to \\"clearly demonstrate that officials are not allowed to act with impunity\\" (Foreign Minister Bill Graham, news conference). *23 July 2003 – Kazemi's body is buried in her hometown of Shiraz in Iran, supposedly according to the wishes of her mother (Ezzat Kazemi) and relatives in Iran, but contrary to the wishes of her son (Stephan Hachemi, who resides in Montreal), and Canadian officials.

He reported injuries consistent with torture, such as flogging wounds on the back and missing fingernails. A female nurse told him of \\"brutal\\" genital injuries. Azam did not give her a vaginal examination himself as it is considered inappropriate in Iran for a male physician to examine a woman in this manner. Azam fled the country, seeking political asylum in Canada to tell his story.Iranian secret police tortured woman to death, says doctor, The Sunday Times 1 April 2005 Aftermath In June 2005, an exhibition at the municipal Côte-Saint-Luc Library in Montreal of photos taken by Zahra Kazemi during her travels in Middle East was shut down following accusations by Jewish patrons of alleged \\"pro-Palestinian bias\\" for including five of her photographs on display that depicted scenes inside Palestinian refugee camps. Gallery officials proceeded to remove the five photographs while leaving the rest of the exhibition. In response, Kazemi's son, Stephen Hachemi, called the removal of the Palestinian photographs \\"a violation of my mother's spirit\\" and demanded that the library either display the entire collection or nothing at all. Eventually, the library closed the entire exhibition. Côte Saint-Luc Mayor Robert Libman told CBC news \\"It's a very complicated conflict, and to create an impression where the Palestinian cause is being martyred by oppression by the Israeli government, we don't consider that to be a fair portrait, in the future, such politically charged work won't be displayed at the library\\". Critics of the decision to take down the exhibition denounced it as \\"censorship\\". Naomi Klein and Aaron Maté wrote that it is \\"part of a disturbing pattern to silence opposition to the expansionist Israeli occupation of the Occupied Territories\\". According to the caption that accompanied the photo exhibition, she \\"illustrated the daily life of Palestinians and the problems they faced as they sought to preserve their land and their identity\\" in the face of \\"exodus, poverty, humiliation, suffering, and the ravages of war\\".

It was created by producer Himan Brown and was based on the imprint given to the mystery novels of Simon & Schuster. In all, 526 episodes were broadcast. Simon & Schuster series In 1930, the first title was published in Simon & Schuster's \\"Inner Sanctum\\" mystery series: I Am Jonathan Scrivener by Claude Houghton. Although the imprint \\"Inner Sanctum\\" also included serious drama (published with blue covers) and romance (published with red covers), for the most part it was associated with mysteries (published in green covers). Lee Wright was the editor of the series, and over the years she introduced such authors as Craig Rice, Gypsy Rose Lee, Patrick Quentin, Thomas Sterling and Anthony Boucher. Horror hosts On January 7, 1941, the Inner Sanctum radio program premiered, the name licensed by Simon & Schuster on condition that at the end of each broadcast the announcer would promote the latest book title published in the series. The anthology series featured stories of mystery, terror and suspense, and its tongue-in-cheek introductions were in sharp contrast to shows like Suspense and The Whistler. The early 1940s programs opened with Raymond Edward Johnson introducing himself as \\"Your host, Raymond\\" in a mockingly sardonic voice. A spooky melodramatic organ score (played by Lew White) punctuated Raymond's many morbid jokes and playful puns. Raymond's closing was an elongated \\"Pleasant dreeeeaams, hmmmmm?\\" His tongue-in-cheek style and ghoulish relish of his own tales became the standard for many such horror narrators to follow, from fellow radio hosts like Ernest Chappell (on Wyllis Cooper's later series, Quiet, Please) and Maurice Tarplin (on The Mysterious Traveler). When Johnson left the series in May 1945 to serve in the Army, he was replaced by Paul McGrath, who did not keep the \\"Raymond\\" name and was known only as \\"Your Host\\" or \\"Mr. Host\\". (Berry Kroeger had substituted earlier for a total of four episodes.) McGrath was a Broadway actor who turned to radio for a regular income. Beginning in 1945, Lipton Tea sponsored the series, pairing first Raymond and then McGrath with cheery commercial spokeswoman Mary Bennett (aka the \\"Tea Lady\\"), whose blithesome pitches for Lipton Tea contrasted sharply with the macabre themes of the stories. She primly chided the host for his trademark dark humor and creepy manner. The creaking door The program's familiar and famed audio trademark was the eerie creaking door which opened and closed the broadcasts. Himan Brown got the idea from a door in the basement that \\"squeaked like Hell.\\" The door sound was actually made by a rusty desk chair. The program did originally intend to use a door, but on its first use, the door did not creak. Undaunted, Brown grabbed a nearby chair, sat in it and turned, causing a hair-raising squeak. The chair was used from then on as the sound prop. On at least one memorable occasion, a staffer innocently repaired and oiled the chair, thus forcing the sound man to mimic the squeak orally. Guest stars Its campy comedy notwithstanding, the stories were usually effective little chillers, mixing horror and humor in equal doses. Memorable episodes included \\"Terror by Night\\" (September 18, 1945) and an adaptation of \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" (August 3, 1941). The latter starred Boris Karloff, who was heard regularly in the first season, starring in more than 15 episodes and returning sporadically thereafter. Other established film stars who appeared on the program in the early years included Bela Lugosi, Mary Astor, Helen Hayes, Peter Lorre, Paul Lukas, Claude Rains, Frank Sinatra, and Orson Welles. Most of the lead and supporting players were stalwarts of New York radio. These included Santos Ortega, Larry Haines, Ted Osborne, Luis van Rooten, Stefan Schnabel, Ralph Bell, Mercedes McCambridge, Berry Kroeger, Arnold Moss, Leon Janney, Myron McCormick, and Mason Adams. Players like Richard Widmark, Everett Sloane, Burgess Meredith, Agnes Moorehead, Ken Lynch, and Anne Seymour also found fame or notability in film or television. Of more than 500 programs broadcast, only about 200 remain in circulation. Example program opening Sound effect: A door with squeaky hinges is slowly opened. Organ begins to play. Raymond: Good evening, friends of the Inner Sanctum. This is Raymond, your host. I'm glad you came tonight, because we have a very special guest of horror with us. I'd like you to meet the late Johnny Gravestone, the most celebrated member of the Inner Sanctum Ghost Society. He's the best haunter of them all. Johnny's the tall figure in the white sheet wearing the blue ribbon. He's haunted everything from a palace to a telephone booth. And uh, if you're very nice to him, he'll be glad to consider giving your house the once-over. Who knows? He might even haunt you! Ha-ha-ha-ha! (Commercial) Raymond: Well, we're about to begin our story. Oh, I forgot to warn you about the Trembliens. They're those pesky, invisible cousins of the gremlins. They uh, you, give quick little shoves, and give the false impression that you're trembling. If you're being troubled by a Tremblien, just grab him by his invisible little horns and stick him into the nearest pin cushion. Films 300px In June 1943, Universal purchased the screen rights to the series from Simon and Schuster, Inc. The Inner Sanctum Mysteries feature a \\"stream of consciousness\\" voiceover which Dein stated he incorporated into his script at Lon Chaney, Jr.'s insistence. With the exception of Pillow of Death, each film is prefaced with a sequence a bobbing head of actor David Hoffman staring out of a crystal ball giving warnings to the audience about how each audience member is capable of murder. Lon Chaney, Jr. was hopeful for the series, craving diversity in his roles after Universal had placed him in various monster roles in their horror films. Pivar planned to produced two Inner Sanctum mystery films a year with each film featuring Chaney and Gale Sondergaard in the lead roles. Sondergaard was dropped from the lead role shortly before the filming of Calling Dr. Death. The films in the series include Calling Dr. Death, Weird Woman, Dead Man's Eyes, The Frozen Ghost, Strange Confession and Pillow of Death. Television The 1954 syndicated television series featured Paul McGrath as the off-camera host/narrator. The TV shows were produced at the Himan Brown Production Center (now Chelsea Studios) in Manhattan. \\"Pleasant dreeeeaaams, hmmmmm?\\" In the 1970s, with his CBS Radio Mystery Theater series, Himan Brown recycled both the creaking door opening and, to a lesser extent, the manner of Raymond. The hosts were E. G. Marshall and during the final season, Tammy Grimes. When the series was rebroadcast during the late 1990s, Brown himself rerecorded the host segments and mimicked Raymond's \\"Pleasant dreeeeaaams, hmmmmm?\\" for the familiar closing. Satires Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder satirized the series in Mad's fifth issue (June–July 1953) with \\"Outer Sanctum!\\" In the opening panels, host Ramon greets the reader: \\"Come in, I've been waiting for you! I've been waiting for you to fix my squeaking door!... What?... You say you're not the carpenter?... You have come to hear a story?... Very well!\\" In the Three Stooges short The Ghost Talks, a creaking door prompts Shemp to parody the opening narration of the program, naming it \\"The Outer Sanctorum.\\" The opening of an Inner Sanctum episode was used to open one side of The Whole Burbank Catalog, a 1972 compilation album in the Warner/Reprise Loss Leaders series from Warner Bros. Records. The announcer's jokey pun in this case concerned an author friend, specializing in best-sellers, who \\"tried to bury [him] in one, because all the very best sellers (cellars) have corpses in them.\\" A backwards version of the creaking door sound effect led directly into \\"Get It On\\" by T. Rex. The popular British 60s radio comedy Round The Horne had occasional sketches that were influenced by the style of the show. Regular cast member Hugh Paddick would introduce the \\"scary\\" sketch with the words \\"Inner Sanctum-um-um-um-um-um...\\" – pretending to echo! This was accompanied by a warbling, quivering, high pitched tone from a Theremin played by an orchestra member. The sketches nearly always ended in confusion as the plots were deliberately circular and convoluted whilst playing up the \\"spookiness\\" of the part. The 1946 Warner Brothers Bugs Bunny cartoon Racketeer Rabbit had Bugs enter an abandoned Victorian house (which was actually the gangsters' hideout) that had a squeaky door. Bugs said as he was entering the house, \\"Huh? Sounds like Inner Sanctum!\\" See also * List of Inner Sanctum episodes References ;Notes ;Further reading * Ohmart, Ben (2002). It's That Time Again.

A captive bead ring (CBR), ball closure ring (BCR), captive hoop, or captive ball ring is a common example of body piercing jewelry. The captive bead or ball fits into a small opening in the circle of the ring. The bead is slightly larger than this opening and has small indentations or depressions that correspond to the ring's end-points so that it may fit snugly against them, thus completing the circuit of the ring. Often, a hole is drilled through the bead to allow easier fitting. It uses the natural tensile or compressive strength of the metal the ring is made of, usually surgical stainless steel, niobium, or titanium, to hold the bead tightly in place. The bead or ball itself may additionally be made from coloured glass, acrylic or ceramic, or a gemstone. This is a popular piece of body jewelry because it conveniently allows the wearer to remove the ring by simply removing the captive bead, the bead is held firmly in place so that it will not easily fall out. Additionally, because of their closed shape and rounded edges, these rings do not easily snag on clothing, hair, or furniture, making them a popular choice for piercings which are still healing. However, its circular shape means that it can drag dried lymph back into the healing piercing, meaning that barbells are seen as being preferable for certain healing piercings.

It typically features fast tempos and aggressive sound samples. The style was pioneered by Alec Empire of the German band Atari Teenage Riot during the early 1990s, and often has sociological or far-left lyrical themes. Characteristics Digital hardcore music is typically fast and abrasive, combining the speed, heaviness and attitude of hardcore punk, thrash metal, and riot grrrl\\"I was totally into the riot grrrl music, I see it as a very important form of expression. I learned a lot from that, way more maybe than from 'male' punk rock.\\" The Punk Years, \\"Typical Girls\\" Access date: August 20, 2008. with electronic music such as hardcore techno, gabber, jungle, drum and bass, glitch, and industrial rock. Some bands, like Atari Teenage Riot, incorporate elements of hip-hop music, such as freestyle rap. According to Jeff Terich of Treble Media, digital hardcore is \\"on the verge of reaching speeds incompatible with popular music, as if the rapid acceleration of BPMs would render the idea of rhythm irrelevant or, at the very least, unpredictable. Maybe this is music for dancing; definitely this is music for screaming and breaking things.\\" The electric guitar (either real or sampled and usually heavily distorted) is used alongside samplers, synthesizers and drum machines. While the use of electronic instruments is a defining feature of the genre, bass guitars, electric guitars, and drum kits are optional. Vocals are more often shouted than sung by more than one member of the group. Typically, the lyrics are highly politicized and espouse left- wing or anarchist ideals. Some practitioners have been influenced by anarcho- punk. History =1990s= German band Atari Teenage Riot are considered progenitors of the style. The music was first defined by the band Atari Teenage Riot, who formed in Berlin, Germany in 1992. The band's frontman, Alec Empire, coined the term \\"digital hardcore,\\" setting up the independent record label Digital Hardcore Recordings in 1994.Interview with J. Amaretto of DHR, WAX Magazine, issue 5, 1995.

Retrieved on 2008-05-28. German bands with a similar style began signing to the label and its underground popularity grew, with small digital hardcore festivals being held in several German cities. By the mid-1990s, a number of new record labels specializing in the genre were formed around the world. These included Gangster Toons Industries (Paris), Praxis (London), Cross Fade Enter Tainment (Hamburg), Drop Bass Network (U.S.), and Bloody Fist (Australia). Digital Hardcore Recordings also had some kinship with the Frankfurt labels Mille Plateaux and Riot Beats. Alec Empire's work subsequently set the template for breakcore.Alvin Chan, Music OMH, March 2008. Access date: August 6, 2008.Matt Earp, \\"Breakcore: Live Fast\\", XLR8R, July 20, 2006. Access date: August 8, 2008. Other prominent digital hardcore musicians of this period include Christoph de Babalon, Cobra Killer, Sonic Subjunkies, EC8OR, Hanin Elias, Lolita Storm, Nic Endo, The Panacea, and The Mad Capsule Markets. =2000s= In Alec Empire's words, \\"Digital Hardcore went from a local, Berlin based scene to an international underground movement.\\"The definitive Alec Empire Interview 26/02/02 The soundtrack to the film Threat included contributions from digital hardcore musicians, along with metalcore bands.Ryan Orvis, MPR, \\"Just a Minor Threat\\", Access date: August 6, 2008. James Plotkin, Dave Witte and Speedranch's project Phantomsmasher combined digital hardcore with grindcore. Notable 21st century digital hardcore groups include Left Spine Down, Motormark, Death Spells, The Shizit, Rabbit Junk, and Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas. =2010s= Digital hardcore saw less prominence in the 2010s. However, its international influence can be seen in the prominence of electronicore, a similar musical genre fusing hardcore punk and metalcore with electronica. The German band We Butter the Bread with Butter has seen commercial success employing this fusion. The term \\"digital hardcore\\" has largely fallen out of use, given its association with politically-charged lyrics, which are not a characteristic of newer electronicore artists. Some notable digital hardcore artists, however, have remained active into the 2010s, including Left Spine Down, Death Spells, Rabbit Junk,, Death Grips,dh and Machine Girl.

This is usually done by blocking the mouth, partially or completely, or attempting to prevent the tongue, lips, or jaw from moving in the normal patterns of speech. The more \\"effective\\" a gag appears to be, the more hazardous it is: for example, duct tape is fairly effective at keeping one's mouth shut but is hazardous if for some reason (e.g., the common cold) the subject cannot breathe freely through the nose. For this reason, a gagged person should never be left alone. The use of gags is commonly depicted in soap operas and crime fiction, particularly in comics and novels. It is also often used in movies, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark and its sequel Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Very rarely, courts have been known to gag unruly defendants. Bobby Seale is one example. Occasionally a cloth over-the-mouth-and-nose gag is used not to prevent speech but to keep dust and aerosols out of the lungs.Described, and called a \\"gag\\", in a recorded commentary in the Catalyst chemical industry museum in Runcorn (Cheshire, England), to keep alkali dust out of workers' lungs. This was done more often in early times in the chemical industry. Types of gags 3 Layer Gag - Stuff, Cleave, and Tape One type of gag familiar in fiction, particularly in crime comics and novels, is a suitably sized piece of cloth pulled over the subject's mouth and tied at the back of his/her head. It is sometimes called the \\"detective gag\\" because many of its first appearances were in crime serials. Sometimes a gag is pushed back between the victim's front teeth into the mouth, or with a hard ball in its middle or reinforced by pushing small cloth items into the mouth. This is common in BDSM, but in practice these sorts of gag can usually be got rid of by working the jaws about and/or pushing with the tongue, and they often do not stop the victim from making a loud inarticulate noise to call for help. Often adhesive tapes are used for improvised gags. A tape gag can cause the skin on the lips to be damaged in its removal or the adhesive can cause chemical burns or reactions. Other uses of the word Tape Gag The word \\"gag\\" has come to have various extended meanings, for example: * Various sorts of laws and orders preventing or stopping discussion or revealing of information, e.g., a parliamentary procedure to end a debate. See gag order. * A gag rule can be a part of court proceedings and congressional proceedings. * Gag (medical device), to keep the mouth open * A gag bit is a special bit type used with horses. In symbolism * Sometimes in political cartoons, a character is shown gagged to represent that in the real world some law or rule or order is preventing him/her from speaking about some matter (see gag order).

He has released many albums, EPs and singles, some under aliases, and remixed over seventy tracks for various artists including Björk.Alec Empire, Discogs, last accessed 14 August 2007. He was also the driving force behind the creation of the digital hardcore genre, and founded the record labels Digital Hardcore Recordings and Eat Your Heart Out Records. Biography Wilke's father was a working-class socialist, himself the son of a radical activist who perished in the Nazi concentration camps of the Second World War.Alec Empire – 2008 – II [Video interview], FaceCulture, 2008-03-05, retrieved 21 March 2008.Catherine Yates, \\"King of Pain\\" (p15-18), Kerrang!, 6 April 2002. His maternal grandfather, Karl Steinhof, was a self-made millionaire who patented the first domestic hand-knitting appliance during the economic boom in Germany in the 1950s.Herbert Schurich (inventor), Hand knitting appliance, US Patent 2,762,213, 11 September 1956. Google Patents. Wilke grew up during the Cold War near the Berlin Wall, which he passed every day on his way to school. The frequent sight of patrol guards with guns influenced his outlook on life from an early age.Alec Empire [Video interview], OC-TV.net, retrieved 22 July 2007. He describes Berlin at the time as: \\"Probably the most left radical place in Germany in the 70s, terrorists, a lot of demonstrations, and probably the first address to hear the latest American music, because of the radio shows the US soldiers brought to Berlin.\\"Interview – The definitive Alec Empire Interview , Digital Hardcore Recordings, retrieved 30 January 2007. =Early influences and career= At the age of ten, Wilke's love of rap led to a vogueing career on the streets of Berlin.David Day, \\"Riotous Empire\\", Pitch Weekly, 28 August – 3 September 1997. AlecEmpireFansite.com .Alec Empire , Drowned in Sound, last accessed 4 August 2006. Later disillusioned by that genre becoming increasingly commercial, he left it behind in favour of a completely different form of musical expression. He had played guitar since the age of eight which coupled with his politically charged upbringing eventually led him to punk music; he formed his first band, Die Kinder (The Kids), at age twelve. By sixteen, however, Wilke came to believe that the punk movement was \\"dead\\" (though the anti-establishment punk attitude would figure significantly in his subsequent output). After leaving Die Kinder, he began listening to classical music and experimenting with electronic instruments.Biba Kopf, \\"Daft Punk\\", The Wire, Issue 166, December 1997. Gostimirovic.com. He eventually became fascinated by the rave scene, and, following German reunification, frequented underground raves in East Berlin, believing his native West Berlin scene to be too commercialised. Known earlier in his career as LX Empire he produced a great deal of what he refers to as \\"faceless DJ music\\".Force Inc. Music Works , AlecEmpireFansite.com, retrieved 22 January 2007. In 1991, while DJing on a beach in France with his friend Hanin Elias, he caught the attention of Ian Pooley, which led to the release of a number of 12\\" records on the Force Inc. label. Although Empire was a prolific producer and DJ at this time,The Destroyer/Digital Hard-core , AlecEmpireFansite.com, last accessed 4 August 2006. and made a comfortable enough living, he nevertheless saw the rave scene as decadent and selfish. This angered him, as he and his friends lived in a city embroiled in politics, and the demise of communist-led governments had given rise to increased conservatism in Germany, whilst few people cared. The German neo-Nazi movement had invaded the scene, declaring trance techno \\"true German music\\". Empire retaliated by utilising samples of 1960s and 1970s funk – a predominantly black style of music – in his solo work. In order to further spread the message, he gathered like-minded individuals Hanin Elias (also a former punk) and Carl Crack (a Swazi MC) to form a band. In 1992, the trio became known as Atari Teenage Riot (ATR). =Atari Teenage Riot and Digital Hardcore Recordings= Atari Teenage Riot's sound was characterised by the use of breakbeats (again sampled from funk and rap, but replayed at more than twice their original speeds), heavy guitar riffs, and the shouting of politically driven lyrics and slogans by the band members (as well as sampled dialogue). Empire provided much of the musical direction, and with the later input of Japanese-American noise musician Nic Endo, the ATR sound took on a more chaotic, arrhythmic nature marked by rough sequencing, improvised mixing and extended \\"noise-fests\\". In his words, this complex style was intended to \\"destroy\\" the \\"simulated harmony\\" of the mainstream electronic music, and that, besides their protest lyrics, \\"riot sound produce riots\\". Empire, who is straight edge, also stated that it was a reaction to both the fashion- victimized and drug-fueled nihilism of the rave scene of the 1990s, once saying that \\"You can't read or do anything else while listening to our music.\\" ATR signed a record deal with Phonogram, a major UK label, in 1993. The two parted ways after only a couple of single releases, due to the band's refusal to play by the label's rules.Todd Hansen, Interview: Atari Teenage Riot , The A.V. Club, 7 July 1997, last accessed 12 December 2006Alec Empire Interview: \\"People Are Organized But Political Music Is Not Really Being Made.\\", Indymedia Ireland, 28 December 2006, retrieved 23 January 2007. In 1994, using the non-refundable cash advance from the deal, Empire started an independent record label that allowed its artists the freedom of expression Phonogram were unlikely to give. He named it Digital Hardcore Recordings (DHR); the direction his sound had taken came to be known as \\"digital hardcore\\". That year, DHR released EPs by EC8OR, Sonic Subjunkies, and Empire himself. While working with ATR, Empire continued steadily with his solo output. He recorded for Force Inc. under several pseudonyms, including the Detroit techno-inspired Jaguar. He also recorded several albums for Force Inc.'s experimental sub- label Mille Plateaux, including Generation Star Wars (his first full solo album) and Low on Ice, which he recorded entirely on his laptop during a three-day tour of Iceland with ATR. In 1995, ATR released their first proper album, Delete Yourself!, on DHR, and, in 1996, Empire released his first solo album for DHR, The Destroyer. In that year, Empire and Mike D signed a deal to release a number of DHR's recordings on the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal record label in the United States. The label also invited DHR artists to tour the US leading to recognition by MTV and alternative radio stations. ATR spent the next few years touring the world with artists such as Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Beck, Rage Against the Machine, the Wu-Tang Clan and Ministry, as well as headlining such memorable shows as the Digital Hardcore festival at CBGB's in New York City in 1998, and the Queen Elizabeth Hall show in London in 1999 at the request of fan John Peel.Keeping It Peel – 19 March 1999, BBC Radio 1, last accessed 14 December 2006. During this time they introduced Nic Endo to their ranks as a fourth member. Listener opinion was often divided over the newer sounds ATR subsequently incorporated, and this, along with other factors, began to strain the band. All of the members found some comfort in their solo work – Empire's output at this time would include his sole release as Nintendo Teenage Robots, and the bootleg recording Alec Empire vs. Elvis Presley, as well as remixes for the likes of The Mad Capsule Markets, Mogwai and Thurston Moore. However, ATR's problems worsened. Onstage at one show in Seattle in 1999, Empire slashed his forearms with a razor. At another show that year in London, in which ATR supported Nine Inch Nails, the band dispensed with the usual song-based formula and delivered one long barrage of what could only be described as \\"noise\\"; this would later be released as Live at Brixton Academy. By the end of 1999, Empire was mentally exhausted, Elias was pregnant and Crack was suffering from psychosis induced by prolonged drug use. The band was put on hiatus; its future was made even more doubtful following Crack's death in 2001,Corey Moss, Atari Teenage Riot Cofounder Dead At 30, MTV, 24 September 2001, retrieved 3 February 2007. and Elias' decision to leave DHR and create Fatal Recordings. =After ATR= Alec Empire performing live in Prato, Italy on 13 January 2007. Empire rebounded in 2001 when he, with assistance from Endo, recorded Intelligence and Sacrifice. The album contained two discs: the first retained the ATR formula, yet exhibited a more polished production style and lyrics of an unusually introspective nature;Alec Empire (int) , Gothtronic, retrieved 22 July 2007. the second disc was an electronic instrumental album, and in contrast was more experimental.

Empire also played a series of live shows performing material from the second disc of Intelligence and Sacrifice; one of these was released as The CD2 Sessions in 2003.

Style Alec Empire's body of work spans a range of electronic (as well as conventionally less electronic) styles. His earlier releases for Force Inc. were influenced by the rave scene in his native Berlin, and included acid house, techno, hardcore, punk and breakbeat (all of which are evident on the SuEcide EPs and the Limited Editions 1990-1994 compilation). On creating DHR his solo recordings for that label consisted largely of the digital hardcore staples of breakcore (as heard on The Destroyer album and EPs) and later experimental noise (as heard on Miss Black America), while his work during the same period for Mille Plateaux saw him experimenting with minimal techno (Pulse Code), ambient (Low on Ice) and musique concrète (Les Étoiles des Filles Mortes). His alter-egos for various labels provided outlets for dabbling in other genres such as drum and bass/jungle (DJ Mowgly), Detroit techno (Jaguar) and even chiptune music (Nintendo Teenage Robots). After the demise of Atari Teenage Riot, Empire's major releases for DHR sought to continue in the guitar-based, punk-influenced vein of the band. Intelligence and Sacrifice utilised live guitars, breakbeats, noise, sampled cinematic dialogue and Empire's trademark spoken/shouted English vocals, while Futurist saw a more obvious return to his punk roots and consequently sounds as if it were largely recorded using all live instrumentation, even though it was electronically produced. The creation of the Eat Your Heart Out label saw a move to a much more electronic-sounding approach with comparatively subdued vocals over synthesized sounds and beats.

Performances include but are not limited to alternative rock, heavy metal, punk rock, hip hop, and electronic music. Lollapalooza has also provided a platform for non-profit and political groups and various visual artists. The four-day music festival in Chicago's Grant Park hosts an estimated 400,000 people each year and sells out annually. Lollapalooza is considered one of the largest and most iconic music festivals in the world and one of the longest running in the United States. In 2019, its Brazilian edition was the world's third most grossing festival, with revenues of $14.5 million. Conceived and created in 1991 by Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell as a farewell tour for his band, Lollapalooza ran annually until 1997, and was revived in 2003. From its inception through 1997 and its revival in 2003, the festival toured North America. In 2004, the festival organizers decided to expand the dates to two days per city, but poor ticket sales forced the 2004 tour to be cancelled.The Associated Press. \\"Lollapalooza 2004 cancels all dates\\". USA Today. June 22, 2004. In 2005, Farrell and the William Morris Agency partnered with Austin, Texas–based company Capital Sports Entertainment (now C3 Presents) and retooled it into its current format as a weekend destination festival in Chicago at Grant Park. In 2014, Live Nation Entertainment bought a controlling interest in C3 Presents.Live Nation Completes Deal for C3 Presents - Billboard, 22 December 2014 In 2010 it was announced that Lollapalooza would remain in Chicago while also debuting outside the United States, with a branch of the festival staged in Chile's capital Santiago on April 2–3, 2011 where they partnered up with Santiago- based company Lotus. In 2011, the company Geo Events confirmed the Brazilian version of the event, which was held at the Jockey Club in São Paulo on 7 and 8 April 2012. The Argentine version started in April 2014 in Buenos Aires, and in November 2014, the first European Lollapalooza was announced, which was held at the former Tempelhof Airport in Berlin.lollapalooza.com , Announcing Lollapalooza Berlin 2015, retrieved 7 November 2014 Etymology The word—sometimes alternatively spelled and pronounced as lollapalootza or lalapaloosa—or \\"lallapaloosa\\" (P. G. Wodehouse, \\"Heart of a Goof\\") dates from a late 19th century/early 20th century American idiomatic phrase meaning \\"an extraordinary or unusual thing, person, or event; an exceptional example or instance\\". Its earliest known use was in 1896. In time the term also came to refer to a large lollipop.Hilburn, Robert. \\"POP MUSIC REVIEW – 'Lollapalooza' – Festival Concert With '60s Concept Isn't the Hoped-For Happening\\". Los Angeles Times. July 22, 1991. Farrell, searching for a name for his festival, liked the euphonious quality of the by-then-antiquated term upon hearing it in a Three Stooges short film.Grimes, Taylor and Longton, Jeff. \\"Lollapalooza History Timeline\\". Billboard. 2007. Paying homage to the term's double meaning, a character in the festival's original logo holds one of the lollipops. The word has also caused a slang suffix to appear in event-planning circles as well as in news and opinion shows that is used synonymously with other suffixes like \\"a-go-go\\", \\"o-rama\\", etc. The suffix \\"(a)palooza\\" is often used to imply (often in hyperbolic language) that an entire event or crowd was made over that term, e.g.: \\"Parks\\"-apalooza, popular Chicago sushi restaurant \\"Roll\\"-apalooza, etc. History =Creation= Inspired by events such as Britain's Reading Festival – which Lollapalooza cofounder Perry Farrell had been due to play in 1990 janesaddiction.org/tour/show/janes- addiction/1990-08-24/1091/ – Farrell, Ted Gardner, Don Muller, and Marc Geiger conceived the festival in 1990 as a farewell for Farrell's band Jane's Addiction.Reynolds, Simon. \\"POP MUSIC; A Woodstock for the Lost Generation\\". The New York Times. August 4, 1991. Unlike previous festivals such as Woodstock, A Gathering of the Tribes (also an influence on Lollapalooza) and the US Festival, which were one-time events held at single venues, Lollapalooza toured across the United States and Canada from mid-July until late August 1991. The inaugural Lollapalooza lineup was made up of artists from alternative rock (such as Siouxsie and the Banshees who were the second headliners), industrial music (such as Nine Inch Nails) and rap (Ice-T rapped and used the platform to launch Body Count, his heavy metal band). The premiere in Phoenix, Arizona, on 18 July 1991 was covered by a report on MTV which ended by journalist Dave Kendall saying \\"Lollapalooza could be the tour of the summer\\", the tour finished off in Seattle on 28 August 1991. Another key concept was the inclusion of nonmusical features.Parvaz, D. \\"Lollapalooza: Then and Now\\". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. August 23, 2003. Performers such as the Jim Rose Circus Side Show, an alternative freak show, and the Shaolin monks stretched the boundaries of rock culture. There was a tent for display of art pieces, virtual reality games, and information tables for political and environmental non-profit groups, promoting counter-culture and political awareness.Wiederhorn, Jon. \\"Corporate Sponsors May Be Key To Lollapalooza's Return\\". MTV.com. January 15, 2003. \\"Basically, I'm bored,\\" Farrell said at the time. \\"I just want to see things that are unexpected and slightly bizarre. The way Barnum & Bailey perceived putting on a show ... well, they had a different angle.\\" =Success and decline= The inaugural edition in 1991 was a surprise massive success. For Dave Grohl of Nirvana who saw it in Los Angeles while mixing Nevermind, the festival helped change the mentalities in the music industry. The Butthole Surfers opened the day playing in front of a big audience and Siouxsie and the Banshees \\"were like the Led Zeppelin of that scene\\". \\"It felt like something was happening, that was the beginning of it all\\". That year, Farrell also coined the term \\"Alternative Nation\\".di Perna, Alan. \\"Brave Noise—The History of Alternative Rock Guitar\\". Guitar World. December 1995. The explosion of alternative rock in the early 1990s propelled Lollapalooza forward; the 1992 and 1993 festivals leaned heavily on grunge and alternative acts, and usually featured an additional rap artist.Nager, Larry. \\"A History of Lollapalooza\\". The Cincinnati Enquirer. July 13, 2003. Punk rock standbys like mosh pits and crowd surfing became part of the canon of the concerts. These years saw great increases in the participatory nature of the event with the inclusion of booths for open-microphone readings and oratory, television-smashing pits and tattooing and piercing parlors.Moses, Robert. \\"Lotta-palooza\\". The Phoenix. August 14, 1992.du Pre, Jolie. \\"2009 Lollapalooza Hits Chicago's Grant Park\\". Associated Content. August 8, 2009.

Jun 25, 1993. Attendee complaints of the festival included high ticket prices as well as the high cost for food and water at the shows.Volpi, Matt. \\"Lollapalooza festival alternates cool music with dumb people\\" . The Daily Collegian. August 1, 1994. The festival played at the Alpine Valley festival in East Troy, Wisconsin on August 29, 1992, and also at World Music Theater in Tinley Park, IL (near Chicago), where concertgoers ripped up chunks of sod and grass and threw them at each other and at the bands, resulting in tens of thousands of dollars in damages to the venue. Lollapalooza with the Chicago skyline backdrop. Grunge band Nirvana was scheduled to headline at the festival in 1994, reportedly being offered nearly $10 million to do it. However, Cobain turned it down, and the band officially dropped out of the festival on April 7, 1994. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's body was discovered in Seattle the next day. Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, made guest appearances at several shows, including the Philadelphia show at FDR Park (usually taking time given to her by The Smashing Pumpkins vocalist/guitarist Billy Corgan), speaking to the crowds about the loss, then singing a minimum of two songs. Farrell worked with rock poster artist Jim Evans (T.A.Z.) to create a series of posters and the complete graphic decoration for the 1994 event, including two 70 foot tall Buddha statues that flanked the main stage. In 1996, Farrell, who had been the soul of the festival, decided to focus his energy to produce his new festival project, ENIT, and did not participate in producing Lollapalooza. Many fans saw the addition of Metallica in 1996 as contrary to the festival's prior practice of featuring \\"non-mainstream\\" artists, and described the crowds attracted by Metallica as being singularly focused on the headliner without respect for the other performing artists. Moreover, festival cofounder Farrell felt that Metallica's macho image violated his peaceful vision for the festival, for alternative culture of the early 1990s was generally against macho behavior.For example, see Mimi Schippers, Rockin' out of the Box: Gender Maneuvering in Alternative Hard Rock. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 2002. (Especially Chapter 1, and page 14.) Farrell quit the tour in protest.Pillsbury, Glenn T. Damage Incorporated: Metallica and the Production of Musical Identity. New York: Routledge, 2006. See page 143. Responding to the controversial Metallica tour, Lollapalooza made efforts to revive its relevance to audiences. The festival booked eclectic acts such as country superstar Waylon Jennings in 1996, and emphasized heavily electronica groups such as The Orb and The Prodigy in 1997. 1997, however, would prove to be the final tour from the initial series of Lollapalooza tours. The festival failed to find a suitable headliner in 1998, and therefore announced Lollapalooza's cancellation.\\"Lollapalooza Cancelled\\". Billboard. April 6, 1998. The cancellation served as a signifier of alternative rock's declining popularity. In light of the festival's troubles that year, Spin said, \\"Lollapalooza is as comatose as alternative rock right now.\\"Weisbard, Eric. \\"This Monkey's Gone to Heaven\\". Spin. July 1998. =Revival and rebirth= Lollapalooza Welcome Sign in Grant Park, Chicago. In 2003, Farrell reconvened Jane's Addiction and scheduled a new Lollapalooza tour. The festival schedule included venues in 30 cities through July and August. The 2003 tour achieved only marginal success with many fans staying away, presumably because of high ticket prices. Another tour scheduled for 2004 was to consist of a two-day festival taking place in each city. It was cancelled in June due to weak ticket sales across the country. Farrell partnered with Capital Sports & Entertainment (now C3 Presents), which co-owns and produces the Austin City Limits Music Festival, to produce Lollapalooza.\\"Pixies, Weezer, Panic Set For Lollapalooza\\". Billboard. CSE, Farrell and the William Morris Agency—along with Charles Attal Presents—resurrected Lollapalooza as a two-day destination festival in 2005 in Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois, with an even greater variety of performers (70 acts on five stages) than that of the touring festival. The festival was generally successful, attracting over 65,000 attendees, despite a 104 degree Fahrenheit Sunday (40 degrees Celsius) heat wave (two people were hospitalized for heat related illness).Matheson, Whitney. \\"Live from Lollapalooza: An hour-by-hour report\\".

After a successful 2008 festival, another deal was signed to keep Lollapalooza in Chicago through 2018, guaranteeing the city $13 million.Kot, Greg. \\"Lollapalooza promoters still searching for Chicago identity\\" . Turn It Up (blog). Chicago Tribune. July 31, 2009. In 2016, Lollapalooza was four days long, from July 28 to July 31, to celebrate the event's 25th anniversary. In 2017, the festival kicked off on the 3rd of August celebrating its 26th year of existence. In 2018, the festival began on August 2 with a line-up of 180 bands.http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/lollapalooza/ct- lollapalooza-2018-best-and-worst-day-1-20180802-story.html On March 20, 2019 - The next version of the annual Lollapalooza festival was announced. On July 27, 2020 it was announced that due to COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 festival in Chicago would now be renamed Lolla2020 and feature a virtual festival broadcast for free on YouTube on July 30-August 2, 2020. The event was scheduled to feature a reunion by Porno for Pyros marking their first performance in 24 years. The event featured new original live performances along with performances from past years. Perry Farrell hosted conversations with Metallica's Lars Ulrich, Chuck D, Matt Pinfield and others, and the event was also planned to feature a special tribute to David Bowie. = Tickets and pricing = Tickets to the flagship and original Lollapalooza edition, in Chicago, are usually sold out extremely quickly. In the 2016 Lollapalooza, the four-day general passes sold out in about one day after they started the sale. The one-day passes sold even more quickly: they were gone less than three hours after organizers revealed the lineup for the four-day music festival. Because of this phenomenon, people who cannot buy the passes try to get them through alternatives sources such as Craigslist and StubHub. This is a common practice, although the prices tend to be significantly higher on these websites. In 2018, the festival experienced unusually slower sales so they released the lineup about 8 hours earlier. In its earliest editions, the official passes used to cost $31.50. However, with its growth and prominent relevance on the music scenario, Lollapalooza passes' prices have been increasing substantially over the years. Comparing the weekend passes for Lollapalooza 2016, which cost $335, not including taxes and fees, with the ones for Lollapalooza 2015, which cost $275, the increase was more than 20%. The price from 2015 to 2018 has remained the same without any increases. =Notable Attendees= 2016 *Bob Saget *Chance the Rapper *Dwyane Wade *Hannibal Buress *Graham Elliot *Malia Obama *Michelle Williams *Patrick Flueger *Sophia Bush 2017 *Ben Zobrist *Bob Guiney *Brandi Cyrus *Cameron Monaghan *Chris Chelios *Daniel Carcillo *Danny Masterson *Ethan Cutkosky *Emma Kenney *Malia Obama *Marina Squerciati *Tinsley Mortimer *Rahm Emanuel *Rumer Willis *Sasha Obama *Shaun White *Shawn Mendes 2018 *Bella Hadid *Courteney Cox *Kylie Jenner *Michael Sam *Normani *Rahm Emanuel *Scott Eastwood *Shamir *Twista *Valee *Victoria Justice International expansion =Chile= In 2010, it was announced that Lollapalooza would debut in South America, with a branch of the festival staged in Chile's capital Santiago on April 2–3, 2011. The Lollapalooza Chile line up included Jane's Addiction, Thirty Seconds to Mars, The National, Manny and Gil The Latin, The Drums, The Killers, Los Bunkers, Ana Tijoux, Javiera Mena, Fatboy Slim, Deftones, Los Plumabits, Cypress Hill, 311, The Flaming Lips and many others. The eighth edition in Chile was held on 16–18 March 2018, with Pearl Jam, Lana Del Rey, The Killers, Red Hot Chili Peppers and LCD Soundsystem as headliners. =Brazil= A Brazilian version of the event was confirmed in 2011, and had its inaugural edition at the Jockey Club in São Paulo on April 7 and 8, 2012. In the following year, Lollapalooza was again held at Jockey Club during Holy Week, this time expanding to three days that filled the whole Paschal Triduum – March 29–31, 2013. The third edition was moved to the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in São Paulo's borough of Interlagos, happening on April 5 and 6, 2014. Interlagos remained the festival's home for the following editions, on March 28–29, 2015, March 12–13, 2016, March 25–26, 2017, March 23, 24, 25, 2018 and April 5, 6, 7, 2019. =Argentina= On September 10, 2013, it was announced that the Argentine version of the festival would be held in Buenos Aires. Since then, Lollapalooza has had an annual edition at the Hipódromo de San Isidro, usually on the last days of March. =Germany= On November 4, 2014, it was announced that the very first Lollapalooza Festival will be held in Europe, in the German capital of Berlin. It is scheduled for September 12–13, 2015, the proposed location is the historical airport ground of Berlin- Tempelhof. In true Lollapalooza fashion, this urban location serves to incorporate regional partners in presenting international events. In the official press release, festival founder Perry Farrell stated that, \\"Berlin's energy, vibrant art, fashion and music scenes are a mirror reflection of what Lollapalooza is all about and I can't wait to share in this cultural exchange\\".Lollapalooza Announces Berlin Festival: Taking place at Tempelhof Airport September 2015, pitchfork.com, 6 November 2014 Lollapalooza Germany was produced by the Lollapalooza U.S. team in addition to Melt! Booking and Festival Republic who have helped run both Reading and Leeds festival in England. The 2016 edition of the festival took place in the Treptower Park in Berlin, 10–11 September. It drew 70,000 visitors each day. At change.org an on-line petition against the festival in the Treptower Park gathered over 6400 supporters. Citizens from the area have created working groups to stop the festival taking place in the Treptower Park. There has been little communication with local inhabitants from either festival organizers or local government. People living directly next to the event location have received an invitation to move to a nearby hotel for the duration of the festival. Since 2018 the festival is held at the Olympiapark Berlin. =Sweden= The first Scandinavian edition of Lollapalooza was held in the capital of Sweden, Stockholm, on the 28-29 of June 2019. = France = On October 12, 2016, Lollapalooza announced that they would be hosting a festival in Paris, France. The inaugural edition of this festival will be taking place at the city's Longchamp Racecourse grounds on July 22–23, 2017. The lineup for Lollapalooza Paris 2017 was announced on January 17, 2017 and includes a lineup featuring Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Weeknd as headliners. Following that, the lineup includes the likes of Imagine Dragons, Lana Del Rey, DJ Snake, London Grammar, Alt-J, The Roots, Marshmello, Liam Gallagher, Martin Solveig, Skepta, Glass Animals, Milky Chance, Don Diablo, Oliver Heldens, Crystal Fighters, Jauz, Alan Walker, and many more. =Other= On August 7, 2012, Perry Farrell announced that Lollapalooza will be debuting in Tel Aviv, Israel. Farrell described Israel as an \\"international music community that listens to everything we all listen to, but the artists weren't traveling there so it was an opportunity.\\" The event was scheduled for August 20–22, 2013 in Hayarkon Park, the city's largest urban park. However, the event has been postponed to an unknown date. While there was no definitive reasoning for the cancellation of the Israel date, various news sources report there are often financial challenges that attribute to producing a large-scale show with international artists within the political situation in the Mideast. Criticism Recording engineer, guitarist, and journalist Steve Albini has criticized Lollapalooza for its corporatization of popularized \\"alternative\\" music. In a 1993 interview, Albini commented: > Lollapalooza is the worst example of corporate encroachment into what is > supposed to be the underground.

The names and details vary among countries. Regional variations =Australia and New Zealand= In Australia and New Zealand, elevenses is known as \\"morning tea\\" and occurs at approximately 10:30am. Many workplaces organize morning teas for staff to welcome new employees, for special occasions such as a birthday, or simply as a regular event. Food will sometimes be provided by the business, but often employees will be expected to bring food to share. = Belgium = In Belgian Dutch, this kind of snack is called a tienuurtje, literally a \\"little (one of) 10 o'clock\\". A tienuurtje typically consists of one or more cookies or some piece of fruit and may be accompanied by fruit juice or chocolate milk. Many parents give their children a tienuurtje to eat during the mid-morning school break. A similar kind of snack for the afternoon break is called a vieruurtje, literally \\"little (one of) 4 o'clock\\". =Chile= In many Spanish-speaking cultures, elevenses is observed under the name la once (in Spanish, once means 'eleven'). However, in Chile it has shifted to the afternoon, sometimes replacing the traditional dinner. In the 2010–2011 National Food Consumption Survey, around 80% of the Chileans reported having once. This is due to once sometimes replacing the traditional dinner in Chile, which only 30% of the population reported having. Here traditional dinner means a proper meal with vegetables, meat, poultry and fish. La once resembles a light version of British High Tea. An alternative widespread, but unfounded, popular etymology for the word in Chile is that priests (in other versions, workers or women) used the phrase tomar las once (Spanish: \\"drink the eleven\\") in reference to the eleven letters of the word Aguardiente to conceal the fact that they were drinking during the day. =Colombia= In Colombia, it is common to have a snack named onces. It consists mainly of hot chocolate, coffee or tea with arepa, bread or crackers, usually taken around 5:00pm. In the morning, the snack consist of the same type of food but it is called medias nueves. It is served generally between 9 and 11 am. = Hungary = Elevenses in Hungarian is called Tíz-órai which translates to \\"of the 10 o'clock\\", referring to \\"the meal of the 10 o'clock\\". This is a break between breakfast and lunch, when it is time for a light meal or snack. In schools the early lunch break is called a Tíz-órai break. Parallel to the word Elevenses, Tíz-órai is often called Tenses \\"Tenzeez\\" by Hungarian-Americans and Hungarian-Britons. =Netherlands= In West Friesland country people had a similar meal called konkelstik (served at konkeltoid, the proper time for konkelen, a verb denoting \\"making a visit\\"). =Poland= In Poland the drugie śniadanie (lit. \\"second breakfast\\") is eaten in the midmorning. Rather than a heavy chunk of sausage or other meat, though, like the German second breakfast, Poles prefer a lighter, dessert-like pastry or sweet with a hot drink, more similar to the American \\"coffee break\\".Preparing a Polish meal last visited 2020-04-17 =Spain= In the Basque Country it is common to have a mid-morning snack consisting of high-protein food like eggs, bacon, or cured meats on bread, called hamarretako (literally \\"10 o'clock (snack)\\") or hamaiketako (\\"11 o'clock (snack)\\"). In Spain there is a break between the time range of 9:00 and 11:00 am, called almuerzo (in Latin American Spanish, this means lunch). In jobs of little physical effort, it can be a light lunch of a coffee, juice, infusion with some sweet or snack of almonds, nuts, or cookies. In jobs of great physical effort is usually a sandwich or a fried egg with ham and cheese. =United Kingdom= Elevenses, eaten at 11 as the name suggests, typically consists of tea or coffee, often with a few biscuits. Sometimes, toast or chocolate bars are eaten instead. =United States= During the first decades of the 19th century, elevenses consisted of drinking whiskey. In modern times, hourly workers take a break known as a coffee break, typically around 10:00am. Oftentimes, this is done in a break room, and small snacks may be eaten as well. It is common for young school children to have a short snack break called morning snack. This is offered in the morning before lunch, usually between 9:00am and 11:00am. This snack is common in schools for children under the age of six. Older children are not offered snacks during school hours but rather are expected to eat only their midday meal, called lunch, during school. A small population of Americans do take British elevenses. In popular culture For elevenses, Winnie-the-Pooh preferred honey on bread with condensed milk. Paddington Bear often took elevenses at the antique shop on Portobello Road run by his friend Mr Gruber, for which Paddington would buy buns and Mr Gruber would make cocoa (hot chocolate). In the Middle-earth stories by J. R. R. Tolkien (The Lord of the Rings), it is a meal eaten by Hobbits between second breakfast and luncheon.

Its ISO 4217 code was IEP, and the usual notation was the prefix £ (or IR£ where confusion might have arisen with the pound sterling or other pounds). The Irish pound was replaced by the euro on 1 January 1999. Euro currency did not begin circulation until the beginning of 2002. First pound The earliest Irish coinage was introduced in the late 10th century, with a pound divided like the English pound into twenty shillings, each of twelve silver pence. Parity with the pound sterling was established by King John around 1210, so that Irish silver could move freely into the English economy and help to finance his wars in France. However, from 1460, Irish coins were minted with a different silver content than those of England, so that the values of the two currencies diverged. During the Williamite War of 1689–1691, King James II, no longer reigning in England and Scotland, issued an emergency base-metal coinage known as gun money. In 1701, the relationship between the Irish pound and the English pound sterling was fixed at thirteen Irish pounds equalling twelve English pounds. (The Pound Scots had yet another value; it was absorbed into the pound sterling in 1707 at a ratio of 12 to 1.) This relationship made it possible for Irish copper coins to circulate with English silver coins, since thirteen Irish pence had the same value as one English shilling. In 1801, Ireland became part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, but the Irish pound continued to exist until January 1826. Between 1804 and 1813 silver tokens worth tenpence were issued by the Bank of Ireland and were denominated in pence Irish. The last copper coins of the Irish pound were minted in 1823, and in 1826 the Irish pound was merged with the pound sterling. After 1826 some Irish banks continued to issue paper bank notes, but these were denominated in pounds sterling, and no more distinctly Irish coins were minted until the creation of the Irish Free State in the 20th century.  Second pound  = pound= From continuing to use sterling after independence (1922), the new Irish Free State brought in its own currency from 1928.The relevant enabling Acts were the Coinage Act, 1926 and the Currency Act, 1927. The new ' (Free State) Pound was defined by the 1927 Act to have exactly the same weight and fineness of gold as was the sovereign at the time, having the effect of making the new currency pegged at 1:1 with sterling. rather than parity with sterling was maintained for another fifty years. As with sterling, the £sd system was used, with the Irish names (plural: ), (plural: ) and (plural: ). Distinctive coins and notes were introduced, the coins from 1928 (in eight denominations: ¼d farthing, ½d halfpenny, 1d penny, 3d threepence, 6d sixpence, 1s shilling, 2s florin, 2s 6d half crown and in 1966 a 10s coin) – all with the same dimensions as their British counterparts. However, the pound sterling generally continued to be accepted on a one-for- one basis everywhere, whereas the Irish currency was not generally accepted in the United Kingdom. =Irish pound= The name of the state became Ireland on the coming into force of the Constitution of Ireland on 29 December 1937. On 10 May 1938, the name of the currency became the Irish pound. = Decimalisation= The Report of the Metric System and Decimal Coinage Committee (1959) was amongst the first formal reports on decimalisation of the currency, discussion continued into the 1960s on the topic. When the British government decided to decimalise its currency, the Irish government followed suit. The Decimal Currency Act 1969 redefined the number of pence in the Irish pound from 240 to 100, with the penny symbol changing from \\"d\\" to \\"p\\". The pound itself was not revalued by this act and therefore pound banknotes were unaffected, although the 10 shilling note was replaced by the 50p coin. The new five pence coin correlated with the old one shilling coin, and the new 10 pence coin correlated with the old two shilling coin. New coins were issued of the same dimensions and materials as the corresponding new British coins. The Decimal Currency Act 1970 made additional provisions for the changeover not related with the issue of coins. Decimalisation was overseen by the Irish Decimal Currency Board, created on 12 June 1968. It provided changeover information to the public, including a pamphlet called Everyone's Guide to Decimal Currency. The changeover occurred on Decimal Day, 15 February 1971. =Breaking the link with sterling= The European Monetary System was introduced in the 1970s. Ireland decided to join it in 1978, while the United Kingdom stayed out.Mr. Hegarty in the Dáil: \\"With regard to our entry into the EMS we are glibly assuming that the Irish £ will appreciate against sterling on our entry. On reading a paper this morning I noticed that the opposite is true. In the first market opened by Barclays the Irish £ depreciated\\". Debates at the Irish Parliament Ireland's on participation in the European Monetary System (13 December 1978) The European Exchange Rate Mechanism finally broke the one-for-one link that existed between the Irish pound and the pound sterling; by 30 March 1979 an exchange rate was introduced.\\"It was only in 1978, when beckoned to join the EMS, a Franco-German project for a new zone of monetary stability in Europe, that the Irish government decided to make the change. At first there was some hope that it would prove possible to hold the Irish pound’s value at one pound sterling while still respecting the fluctuation limits in the EMS, despite the fact that Britain had not joined the new exchange-rate mechanism. But the strength of sterling in the early months of the EMS, buoyed up as it was by North Sea oil revenues and by the tight monetary policy of the Thatcher administration, put paid to that hope. It is arguable that a continuation of the sterling link into the early 1980s would have proved politically unsupportable, considering the loss of competitiveness that it might have entailed at a time of rapidly growing unemployment associated with the fiscal adjustment of those years\\". \\"Encyclopedia of Irish History and Culture\\", Vol. 1, James Donnelly ed., Macmillan Thomson Gale (2002) This period also saw the creation of the Currency Centre at Sandyford in 1978, where banknotes and coinage could be manufactured within the state. Prior to this, banknotes were printed by specialist commercial printers in England, and coins by the British Royal Mint. =1979–1999: Free-floating currency = Until 1986, all decimal Irish coins were the same shape and size as their UK counterparts. After this, however, all new denominations or redesigned coins were of different sizes to the UK coinage. The new 20p coin introduced that year and the £1 coin (introduced in 1990) were completely different in size, shape and composition from the previously introduced UK versions. When the UK 5p and 10p coins were reduced in size, the Irish followed suit, but the new Irish 10p was smaller than the new UK version introduced in 1992 and the new Irish 5p was slightly larger than the UK version introduced in 1990. The Irish 50p was never reduced in size (as it was in the UK in 1997). =Replacement with the euro= On 31 December 1998, the exchange rates between the European Currency Unit and the Irish pound and 10 other EMS currencies (all but the pound sterling, the Swedish krona and the Danish krone) were fixed. The fixed conversion factor for the Irish pound was €1 = IR£0.787564. :The initial sterling/euro exchange rate was GB£1.00 = €1.42210, making GB£1.00 about IR£1.12. By 1 January 2002, the day when euro cash was introduced, GB£1 was worth about IR£1.29. By May 2012, following the appreciation of the euro since its launch and the fall of sterling in 2007–2009, GB£1.00 was the equivalent of IR£0.98. , GB£1.00 had fallen to the equivalent of about IR£0.92 as sterling depreciated further after the 2016 Brexit referendum. Although the euro became the currency of the eurozone countries including Ireland on 1 January 1999, it was not until 1 January 2002 that the state began to withdraw Irish pound coins and notes, replacing them with euro specie. All other eurozone countries withdrew their currencies in a similar fashion, from that date. Irish pound coins and notes ceased to be legal tender on 9 February 2002, although they are intended to be exchangeable indefinitely for euro at the Central Bank. On 31 December 2001, the total value of Irish banknotes in circulation was €4,343.8 million, and the total value of Irish coins was €387.9 million. The Irish cash changeover was one of the fastest in the eurozone, with some shops illegally ceasing to accept pounds after the first week or two. With a conversion factor of 0.787564 Irish pounds to the euro,Of the 15 national currencies originally tied to the euro (also including the currencies of Vatican City, Monaco and San Marino ), the Irish pound was the only one whose conversion factor was less than 1, i.e. the unit of the national currency was worth more than one euro. 56%, by value, of Irish banknotes was withdrawn from circulation within two weeks of the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, and 83.4% by the time they ceased to have legal tender status. Withdrawal of coinage was slower, having a lower priority, with only 45% of coins withdrawn by 9 February 2002. All Irish coins and banknotes, from the start of the Irish Free State onwards, both decimal and pre-decimal, may be redeemed into euros (by bank transfer only) at the Central Bank of Ireland in Dublin. Hidden inflation When decimal currency and the euro were in turn introduced, many people in Ireland believed that prices had been improperly raised by traders taking advantage of the confusion,Inside Ireland, The Euro by Hugh Oram (retrieved 29 October 2006) exchange rates notwithstanding. In the case of the euro, the Irish government took special measures to try to prevent any unnecessary price changes, which ultimately proved to be ineffective. The changeover coincided with an economic boom in the country, and inflation was moderately high. People were eager to blame price rises on merchants taking advantage of changeover confusion. Most retailers, especially the larger chains, continued to show prices in Irish pounds beneath the price in Euro for up to five years after the changeover, enabling people to see the price in old currency and check whether prices had been improperly inflated.

Touch football is a variant of American football in which the basic rules are similar to those of the mainstream game (called \\"tackle football\\" for contrast), but instead of tackling players to the ground, the person carrying the ball need only be touched by a member of the opposite team to end a down. The game is usually played by amateurs on a recreational basis. Rules Depending on the skill of the players, the available playing field, and the purpose of the game, the rules other than the tackling aspect may remain mostly the same or vary considerably from traditional American football. Touch football can be played by teams as few as two or as many as eleven on each side; usually, games consist of teams of four to seven. Positions in touch football are far less formal than its more organized counterpart. While some games roughly follow conventions, more often, all players will be considered eligible receivers (as in six-man football), and there are usually no running backs. There may or may not be a snapper; if there is not, the quarterback initiates play by hovering the ball above the line of scrimmage and pulling it backward to simulate a snap. Generally, in touch football, nearly every play is a passing play, whereas run plays and pass plays tend to be well balanced in organized football. Some games will also implement a \\"blitz count\\", or a period of time that must elapse after the snap before the defense may cross the line of scrimmage in order to attempt to tackle the quarterback. The count thus gives the quarterback time to complete a pass in the absence of effective blocking (when teams are small, there is often no blocking at all). Other games will not use a count and thus blocking becomes important. Conversely, in the presence of a \\"blitz count\\" there is also often a \\"QB sneak\\" rule, which prevents the quarterback from taking unfair advantage of the blitz count by preventing the quarterback from crossing the line of scrimmage before the blitz count is finished. Field during a recreational touch ball game. Because of these rules, passing plays are far more common than running plays in touch football. Along with the size of the teams, the size of the field can vary considerably. In a park, or spring practice situation, a full-sized field may be available, but many games are played in the front and back yards of suburban and rural village neighborhoods, where the whole field may not be much more than ten to thirty yards long. In most of these situations, there are no yard lines, requiring some change in the definition of a first down. Instead of requiring that a team advance the ball ten yards, sometimes two pass completions result in a first down. Another option is to eliminate first downs entirely, so that a team gets four (sometimes five) chances to score; this process is most desirable on shorter fields. When it is desired for an odd number of players to play, it is common to allow one player to be an \\"all- time Quarterback\\" player; this player will always be on the offense or the kicking team, switching sides throughout the game. This is often better known as a \\"Steady Quarterback\\" or \\"Steady Q\\". When this occurs, there is usually no blitz count and the all-time quarterback is usually never allowed to cross the line of scrimmage. Another common variation is the elimination of the field goal and extra point kick; this is usually due to the absence of goal posts and tees on the field as well as due to poor kicking skill by the participants. Some games eliminate kicking altogether, directing the teams to start each possession after a touchdown at the twenty-yard line, as if a kickoff and touch back had just occurred; other players prefer to change the kickoff into a \\"throw-off\\" or a \\"punt-off.\\" Scoring and game timing are much different in touch football than its more organized counterpart. For simplicity, touchdowns are usually worth 1 point and no other scoring is counted (there are no extra point attempts). In a much lesser used variation, a touchdown is worth 6 points and if the player who scored the touchdown can progress in the other direction from the end zone in which he had just scored back to the opposite end zone without being touched, it counts as a two-point conversion. The former scoring method does not allow for other scoring types such as safeties. There is usually no game clock and the game ends when one opponent has reached 10 touchdowns (in the former convention) or 100 points (in a standard convention). Variable rules =Kickoff= Change of possession after scoring is often accompanied by rules determining where the ball is thrown from as opposed to actually kicking since throwing offers more control to players who may be playing in street-accessible areas and don't wish to chase a ball through traffic. When the kickoff style is open to variance after each score, the desired rules are called out and whichever is heard first, is the accepted rule. When the rules are agreed on before the start of a game and are made to be steady throughout, they are referred to as Auto-. The most accepted Auto- rules are Half Court, In Hands-- this offers a rule that gives advantages to both the kicking and receiving teams. =First touch= This rule controls the action of the offensive team's current quarterback, and requires that the blocking/countdown rule not be in use. When teams are even, a \\"shift\\" (hand-off) between two offensive players begins the play. It takes a touch from a defender assigned to the quarterback (the \\"first touch\\",) to stop his initial forward progress and determine where the ball will be thrown from. The assigned defender is stuck to the quarterback, unable to act as a pass defender or hinder the quarterback in his search of a receiver. Depending on the group, first touch can refer to the quarterback's ability to run or walk after the shift. For example, one group may refer to first touch as the ability for the quarterback to run after the shift, get touched, and still throw the ball. Another group may use the rule to mean that the quarterback has the ability to walk or powerwalk forward, get touched, and throw. The first variation favors a game with many players, while the second may be best for games where there aren't many players. Another addition to this rule is the \\"two-man touch,\\" which penalizes the defense for being unaware of their assignments and teammates by making all players who touch the active quarterback stick to him, removing a defender from the field temporarily. This rule is commonly and informally referred to \\"first taught,\\" the result of players creating another past tense verb for \\"touch.\\" =Hand Touch= As the name suggests, this rule determines the number of hands that must land on an offensive player simultaneously to stop the play/first touch situation. One-hand touch is often used with younger players, as two-hand touch demands greater dexterity. When used against more mature players, one- hand touch puts more pressure on the offense to juke and misdirect the defense. A variant called \\"rough touch\\" is also sometimes used, in which the defensive player must place both hands on the ball carrier with sufficient force to lightly shove him in order to stop the play. This is somewhat subjective, but tends to reduce the frequency of disputed touches. =No/Half Court= In Half Court, the ball is kicked off at the halfway mark in the field. In No Half Court, the ball is expected to be thrown from the kicking team's goal line. Half Court is practical when playing on a long field, but it puts the kicking team closer and potentially limits the maneuverability of the receiving team. Half Court is preferred by kicking teams as it dramatically shortens the amount of space and time between the teams. =No/In Hands= In Hands means that the ball will be thrown to any specific person, usually at the kicker's discretion. No In Hands means that the ball will be thrown in the general area of the team, but without a target. In Hands saves the receiving team the trouble of chasing a bobbling ball, and is preferred. =First Down= Rules on first downs vary depending on the playing group and field size. In shorter fields, it may be impractical or unnecessary to create landmarks which would reset the downs, as four downs should be all the time needed to go from one end to the other. However, longer fields may need a halfway marker which, when reached, would reset the downs. Multiple markers can be used in this way depending on the field length. As stated above in the article, a number of completed passes may also result in a first down, if the teams desire it so. It is uncommon to see both length-based and pass-based rules in use simultaneously. =Extra Points= Some games count touchdowns as 1 point each. However, if traditional scoring is desired and no goal posts are available, teams have the option of using \\"automatic\\" extra points. After a touchdown (6 points), teams can choose whether to automatically earn an extra point (for 7 total), or risk the extra point and attempt a 2-point conversion (for 8 total). =Field Goals= If traditional scoring is desired and no goal posts are available, teams can implement a \\"field goal zone\\" close to the endzone. Anytime a team is within this zone, they may elect to automatically score 3 points and kickoff to the other team. This gives teams a choice whether to risk going for the touchdown, or take the free points. =Safeties= If traditional scoring is used, teams score 2 points for a safety, and then receive the ball off of a free kick. However, if simplified \\"1 point-per-touchdown\\" scoring is used, this creates a dilemma. Solutions are to score 1/2 point or 1 full point for the safety and receive the ball off of a free kick; or have the safety result in a \\"turnover\\" to the opposite team, with the ball placed near the goal line.

Vince Young of the Texas Longhorns (ball carrier in top center) rushing for a touchdown. A portion of the end zone is seen as the dark strip at the bottom. The vertical yellow bar is part of the goal post. A touchdown is a scoring play in gridiron football. Whether running, passing, returning a kickoff or punt, or recovering a turnover, a team scores a touchdown by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone. Description To score a touchdown, one team must take the football into the opposite end zone. In all gridiron codes, the touchdown is scored the instant the ball touches or \\"breaks\\" the plane of the goal line (that is, if any part of the ball is in the space on, above, or across the goal line) while in possession of a player whose team is trying to score in that end zone. This particular requirement of the touchdown differs from other sports in which points are scored by moving a ball or equivalent object into a goal where the whole of the relevant object must cross the whole of the goal line for a score to be awarded. The play is dead and the touchdown scores the moment the ball touches plane in possession of a player, or the moment the ball comes into possession of an offensive player in the end zone (having established possession by controlling the ball and having one or both feet depending on the rules of the league or another part of the body, excluding the hands, touch the ground). The slightest part of the ball touching or being directly over the goal line is sufficient for a touchdown to score. However, only the ball counts, not a player's helmet, foot, or any other part of the body. Touching one of the pylons at either end of the goal line with the ball constitutes \\"breaking the plane\\" as well. Touchdowns are usually scored by the offense by running or passing the ball. The former is called a rushing touchdown, and in the latter, the quarterback throws a touchdown pass or passing touchdown to the receiver, who either catches the ball in the field of play and advances it into the end zone, or catches it while already being within the boundaries of the end zone; the result is a touchdown reception or touchdown catch. However, the defense can also score a touchdown if they have recovered a fumble or made an interception and return it to the opposing end zone. Special teams can score a touchdown on a kickoff or punt return, or on a return after a missed or blocked field goal attempt or blocked punt. In short, any play in which a player legally carries the ball across the goal line scores a touchdown, and the manner in which he gained possession is inconsequential. In the NFL, a touchdown may be awarded by the referee as a penalty for a \\"palpably unfair act\\", such as a player coming off the bench during a play and tackling the runner, who would otherwise have scored. A touchdown celebration A touchdown is worth six points. The scoring team is also awarded the opportunity for an extra point or a two-point conversion. Afterwards, the team that scored the touchdown kicks off to the opposing team, if there is any time left in the half. The officials' hand signal for a touchdown is both arms extended vertically above the head, with palms facing inward—the same signal used for a field goal or conversion. Unlike a try scored in rugby, and contrary to the event's name, the ball does not need to touch the ground when the player and the ball are inside the end zone. The term touchdown is a holdover from gridiron's early days when the ball was required to be touched to the ground as in rugby, as rugby and gridiron were still extremely similar sports at this point. This rule was changed to the modern-day iteration in 1889. History When the first uniform rules for American football were enacted by the newly formed Intercollegiate Football Association following the 1876 Rugby season, a touchdown counted for of a kicked goal (except in the case of a tie) and allowed the offense the chance to kick for goal by placekick or dropkick from a spot along a line perpendicular to the goal line and passing through the point where the ball was touched down, or through a process known as a \\"punt- out\\", where the attacking team would kick the ball from the point where it was touched down to a teammate. If the teammate could fair catch the ball, he could follow with a try for goal from the spot of the catch, or resume play as normal (in an attempt to touch down the ball in a spot more advantageous for kicking). The governing rule at the time read: \\"A match shall be decided by a majority of touchdowns. A goal shall be equal to four touchdowns; but in case of a tie a goal kicked from a touchdown shall take precedence over four touchdowns.\\" *In 1881, the rules were modified so that a goal kicked from a touchdown took precedence over a goal kicked from the field in breaking ties. *In 1882, four touchdowns were determined to take precedence over a goal kicked from the field. Two safeties were equivalent to a touchdown. *In 1883, points were introduced to football, and a touchdown counted as four points. A goal after a touchdown counted as two points. *In 1889, the provision requiring the ball to actually be touched to the ground was removed. A touchdown was now scored by possessing the ball beyond the goal line. *In 1897, the touchdown scored five points, and the goal after touchdown added another point - hence the current terminology: \\"extra point\\". *In 1900, the definition of touchdown was changed to include situations where the ball becomes dead on or above the goal line. *In 1912, the value of a touchdown was increased to six points. The end zone was also added. Before the addition of the end zone, forward passes caught beyond the goal line resulted in a loss of possession and a touchback. The increase from five points to six did not come until much later in Canada, and the touchdown remained only five points there until 1956. In addition, the score continued to commonly be called a try in Canada until the second half of the twentieth century. The ability to score a touchdown on the point-after attempt (two-point conversion) was added to NCAA football in 1958, high school football in 1969, the CFL in 1975 and the NFL in 1994. The short-lived World Football League, a professional American football league that operated in 1974 and 1975, gave touchdowns a 7-point value.

Gamblers can buy (also known as \\"back\\") and sell (also known as \\"lay\\") the outcome, and they can trade in real-time throughout the event, either to cut their losses or lock in profit. Bookmaker operators generate revenue by offering less efficient odds. Betting exchanges normally generate revenue by charging a small commission on winning bets. History The first betting exchanges were flutter.com and Betfair. Flutter and Betfair merged in 2001 with Betfair chosen as the primary betting exchange. The flutter.com site ceased operations in January 2002. Since then Betfair has maintained a leading position in the betting exchange market. BETDAQ (which also trades as the 'Ladbrokes Exchange') is believed to be the second largest betting exchange and it had an estimated 7% share of the betting exchange market in 2013. BETDAQ is owned by Ladbrokes plc (now Ladbrokes Coral) following the acquisition in February 2013. Other betting exchanges include Matchbook, Degens and Smarkets. Exchanges and traditional bookmakers compared Most exchanges make their money by charging a commission which is calculated as a percentage of net winnings for each customer on each event, or market. Gamblers whose betting activities have been restricted by bookmakers (normally for winning too much money) are able to place bets of unrestricted size as long as one or more opposing customers are willing to match their bets. The odds available on a betting exchange are usually better than those offered by bookmakers, in spite of the commission charged, because there are smaller overrounds. In spite of these advantages, exchanges currently have some limitations. Because exchanges seek to concentrate their liquidity in as few markets as possible, they are not currently suited to unrestricted multiple parlay betting. Betfair does offer accumulators but these are limited in number and type: users cannot determine the outcomes contained in accumulators themselves. Some exchanges such as BETDAQ also offer multiples but the exchanges act in the same manner as traditional bookmakers in doing so (i.e. they themselves and not a customer act as the layer of such bets). Exchanges also tend to restrict the odds that can be offered to between 1.01 (1 to 100) and 1000 (999 to 1). Backing and laying Traditionally betting has occurred between a customer and a bookmaker where the customer 'backs' (bets that an outcome will occur) and the bookmaker 'lays' (bets that the outcome will not occur). Betting exchanges offer the opportunity for anyone to both back and lay. For example, if someone thinks that Team A will win the competition, they may support that choice. The bookmaker offering this bet to the player will choose this option. Both sides will agree on the sponsor's bet and odds. If the team loses, the layer/bookmaker retains the patron's bet. If the team wins, the layer will pay the sponsor the winnings according to the agreed odds. Since every bet you make requires a patron and a layer, and the exchange of bets is not a participant in the bets made on it, any exchange of bets requires both patrons and layers. In-play betting Exchanges allow bets to be made in-running or in-play (i.e. to make bets while a race or match is in progress). This feature is generally restricted to the most popular events for which widespread, live television coverage is available. Whereas non-in-play bets are entered into the system immediately after being placed by the customer, when betting in-play a time delay might be instituted so as to make it somewhat more difficult for unscrupulous customers to accept offers for bets that for whatever reason have suddenly become highly favorable. Markets may also be actively managed by the operator. In this case, betting will be briefly halted after each occurrence likely to cause a substantial change in the odds (for example, in association football matches goals, penalty kicks and sendings off would warrant such suspensions), so that unmatched bets can be cancelled. Traders and arbitrageurs Arbitrageurs (colloquially \\"arbers\\") attempt to simultaneously bet on all possible outcomes to make a guaranteed profit. A trader operates similarly to an arbitrageur but is willing to take on extra risk and bet on events where no immediate profit is possible. A trader hopes to make a profit by closing out the bet at a later stage at more favorable odds. Closing out a bet for profit involves collecting more money by laying than is paid out when the outcome is backed back. If the event does not occur then no money is lost, alternatively if a trader is able to lay a higher stake at shorter odds than his back stake then he can theoretically guarantee the same amount of profit regardless of the outcome. On the other hand, if the odds move against the trader he might elect to close out the bet so as to minimise his loss. Trading can be done either before the start of an event or while the event is in progress if in-play betting is offered. Compared to trading before the event commences, trading in-play usually involves both greater risk and also the potential to make more money. Traders can make money by betting exclusively with betting exchanges or bookmakers, or by combining the two. The trader could lay at a low amount on a betting exchange and then back at a higher price with a bookie or another exchange. This must be done simultaneously to guarantee a profit or else the opportunity could quickly cease to exist with liquid markets quickly correcting prices and bookies trying to avoid being arbitraged. Most exchanges post the book percentages (colloquially known as the overround or \\"vig\\") prominently for each market. These percentages are essentially the cumulative implied percentage chances of the odds on offer for each selection and for a single winner market will usually add up to more than 100% for all back selections (but only marginally over in a competitive market), and under 100% for the lay selections. This ensures that simultaneously backing or laying all selections in a market will not normally guarantee a profit. Occasionally though (especially in circumstances where odds are prone to change rapidly) exceptions will arise where offers to back or lay all selections will be made that if simultaneously and cumulatively accepted at exactly the right stakes would permit an arbitrageur to guarantee a profit. However, such phenomena tend to correct themselves very quickly and exchanges generally try to dissuade customers from attempting to take advantage of such circumstances. Furthermore, for a trader or arbitrageur to combine different exchanges and/or bookmakers for a profit requires a substantial price differential if a profit is in fact to be made once the exchange's commission is taken into account. Even between exchanges, such large price differences are rare, brief and usually involve relatively small stakes. Fortunately for traders, almost all betting exchanges charge commission on net winnings only and charge no commission at all in the event of a net loss. This suits the trader's high turnover, low profit strategy provided he bets exclusively with a single exchange. Unless a trader is willing to accept the risks inherent with in-play trading, the profit or loss for a trader will typically be no more than 10% of the total amount of his combined back and lay stakes in any particular market, so to make meaningful amounts of money a trader needs to commit a relatively large amount of capital. The trader therefore runs the risk of having a large unwanted bet on an event if he is unable to close his position before the event starts (e.g. if there are technical problems with his Internet connection or with the exchange). Traders and arbitrageurs are often credited with \\"seeding\\" markets with more competitive prices than would be present without them. However, Betfair's imposition of a premium charge in September 2008 was seen by some as being directed at the most skilled traders, whom it is speculated trade for a loss very infrequently and thus would otherwise pay little in the way of commission. In response, rival exchanges have pledged not to introduce similar charges, perhaps in hopes of enticing traders to move their business (and capital) elsewhere. Controversy The fact gamblers can lay outcomes on the exchanges has resulted in criticism from traditional bookmakers including the UK's \\"Big Three\\" - Gala Coral Group, Ladbrokes and William Hill. These firms argue that granting \\"anonymous\\" punters the ability to bet that an outcome will not happen is causing corruption in sports such as horse racing since it is much easier to ensure a horse will lose a race than to ensure that it will win. Exchanges counter that, while corruption is possible on any gambling platform, the bookies' arguments are motivated not by concern for the integrity of sport but by commercial interests. Exchanges also assert they are well aware of who their customers are and keep a complete record of all betting activity in case of enquiries, whereas high-street bookies take anonymous cash bets. Furthermore, customers can monitor the odds on the exchanges' user-friendly platforms independently. Exchanges and the authorities can be immediately alerted should suspicious betting patterns become apparent. Some exchanges have signed agreements with governing bodies of sport including the Jockey Club, with whom they insist they will co-operate fully if the latter suspects corruption to have taken place. Exchanges have co-operated with police investigations when asked to do so, sometimes leading to arrests. In February 2013, Ladbrokes (now Ladbrokes Coral) acquired BETDAQ, which is a betting exchange. Of the UK's \\"Big Three\\" only William Hill doesn't own a betting exchange.

He is best known for his stint as the second host of The Tonight Show from 1957 to 1962. Time magazine's obituary of him notes, \\"His fans would remember him as the fellow who split talk show history into two eras: Before Paar and Below Paar.\\"Corliss, Richard (2004). \\"That Old Feeling: Parr Excellence\\", January 30, 2004, archives of Time online edition (New York, N.Y.). Retrieved March 4, 2004. Early life and education Paar was born in 1918 in Canton, Ohio, the son of Lillian M. (Hein) and Howard Paar.Wepman, Dennis. \\"Paar, Jack\\", American National Biography Online, Oxford University Press (Oxford, England). Retrieved January 8, 2019. He moved with his family to Jackson, Michigan, about south of Lansing, as a child. As a child he developed a stutter which he learned to manage. He contracted tuberculosis when he was 14, and left school at 16. Career =Early career= He first worked near home as a radio announcer at WIBM in Jackson, Michigan, and later as a humorous disc jockey at Midwest stations, including WJR in Detroit, WIRE in Indianapolis, WGAR in Cleveland, and WBEN in Buffalo. In his book P.S. Jack Paar, he recalled doing utility duty at WGAR in 1938 when Orson Welles broadcast his famous simulated alien invasion, The War of the Worlds, over the CBS network (and its WGAR affiliate). Attempting to calm possibly panicked listeners, Paar announced, \\"The world is not coming to an end. Trust me. When have I ever lied to you?\\" Paar was drafted into the military in 1943 during World War II, interrupting his tenure as host of WBEN's morning show The Sun Greeter's Club (he opted not to return to the station at war's end, instead seeking opportunities in network radio and film). He was assigned to the U.S.O. in the South Pacific to entertain the troops. He was a clever, wisecracking master of ceremonies whose impersonations of officers nearly got him into trouble. =Radio and films= After World War II, Paar worked in radio as a fill-in on The Breakfast Club show and appeared as a host of Take It or Leave It, a show with a top prize of $64. He got his big break when Jack Benny, who had been impressed by Paar's U.S.O. performances, suggested that Paar serve as his 1947 summer replacement. Paar was enough of a hit on Benny's show that Benny's sponsor, the American Tobacco Company, decided to keep him on the air, moving him to ABC for the fall season. Paar later refused American Tobacco's suggestion that he come up with a weekly running gag or gimmick, saying he \\"wanted to get away from that kind of old-hat comedy, the kind being practiced by Jack Benny and Fred Allen.\\" The show was then terminated, earning Paar the enduring image of \\"a spoiled kid\\". A profile of Paar by the Museum of Broadcast Communications suggests that Paar later emulated Benny's mannerisms. Paar also signed as a contract player for Howard Hughes' RKO Pictures studio in the immediate postwar period, appearing as the emcee in the movie Variety Time (1948), a compilation of vaudeville sketches. He later recalled that RKO producers had trouble figuring out what kind of screen characters he could play until one of the executives dubbed him, \\"Kay Kyser [a popular bandleader of the time], with warmth.\\" Another compared his leading man appearance with Alan Ladd. Paar projected a pleasant personality on film, and RKO called him back to emcee another filmed vaudeville show, Footlight Varieties (1951). He also appeared in the 1950 film Walk Softly, Stranger, starring Joseph Cotten. In 1951, he played Marilyn Monroe's boyfriend in the 20th Century Fox film Love Nest. Paar returned to radio in 1950, hosting The $64 Question for one season, then quitting in a wage dispute after the show's sponsor pulled out and NBC insisted everyone involved take a pay cut. In 1956, he gave radio one more try, hosting a disc jockey effort on ABC called The Jack Paar Show. Paar once described that show as \\"so modest we did it from the basement rumpus room of our house in Bronxville.\\" =Television= Paar got his first tastes of television in the early 1950s, appearing as a comic on The Ed Sullivan Show and hosting two game shows, Up To Paar (1952) and Bank on the Stars (1953), before hosting The Morning Show (1954) on CBS. He guest-starred twice in 1958 on Polly Bergen's short-lived NBC comedy/variety show, The Polly Bergen Show. The Tonight Show left With the success of Steve Allen as the first host of The Tonight Show, NBC gave him his own primetime variety hour in June 1956. Over the next seven months, Allen's Tonight duties were limited to three nights a week, with Ernie Kovacs filling in on Mondays and Tuesdays. With this heavy work load and his new show a success, Allen departed Tonight in January 1957. For the next six months, NBC renamed and replaced its late-night programing with a multihosted, multicity-based talk show which became a huge, embarrassing failure. In need of a hit, the network soon returned to a proven formula by reviving Tonight and hiring Jack Paar. He remained as host until 1962. At first it was entitled Tonight Starring Jack Paar; after 1959, it was officially known as The Jack Paar Show. Paar often was unpredictable, emotional, and principled. When network censors cut a joke about a \\"water closet\\" (a term used for a toilet) from the show's February 10, 1960, broadcast tape before airtime without warning, he received national attention by walking off the program the following evening in protest. He did not return until three weeks later, after the network apologized and he was allowed to tell the joke. Paar's emotional nature made the everyday routine of putting together a 105-minute program difficult to continue for more than five years. As a TV Guide item put it, he was \\"bone tired\\" of the grind, although he later confided to interviewer Dick Cavett that leaving the program was the greatest mistake of his life. He signed off the show for the last time on March 29, 1962, spending much of that final program ripping his enemies in the press, notably gossip columnists Walter Winchell and Dorothy Kilgallen.\\"Jack Paar's Last Tonight Show (March 29, 1962-Audio Only)\\", initially published by \\"epaddon\\" February 17, 2017, on YouTube, a subsidiary of Alphabet, Inc., Mountain View, California. Retrieved January 8, 2019. Prime time Because NBC did not want to lose Paar to another network, it offered him a Friday primetime hour, giving him carte blanche on content and format. He agreed, deciding on a variation of his late-night format and titling the show The Jack Paar Program. The show, which debuted in the fall of 1962, had a world view, debuting acts from around the globe and showing films from exotic locations. Most of the films included in it were made on travels by guests such as Arthur Godfrey or Paar himself (e.g., several visits with Albert Schweitzer at his compound in Gabon in Central Africa, and Mary Martin at her home in the jungles of Brazil). Paar showed film clips of The Beatles performing, one month before their famous live appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.The Beatles' first U.S. television appearance was in a feature story on The Huntley-Brinkley Report on November 18, 1963. During the first half of 1964, a mock feud pitted Paar against the show immediately preceding his program, Englishman David Frost's news-satire series That Was The Week That Was. A typical exchange would have \\"TW3\\", as it was referred to, \\"signing off\\" the NBC Television Network just before the Paar program, with Paar responding that the show immediately preceding his was \\"Henry Morgan's Amateur Hour\\" (Morgan was a frequent guest on \\"TW3\\"). The feud suddenly evaporated when NBC moved \\"TW3\\" to a different time slot. Paar's primetime show aired for three years, including a wide variety of guests such as comedian Brother Dave Gardner, actor-director Peter Ustinov, Lawrence of Arabia's brother, actor Richard Burton, pianist-actor Oscar Levant, news icon Lowell Thomas, boxing champion Muhammad Ali reciting his poetry to piano accompaniment by Liberace, Judy Garland, Jonathan Winters, Woody Allen, Bill Cosby (whose nickname for Paar was \\"The Boss\\"), Bette Davis, Robert Morley, Cliff Arquette (as his Charley Weaver character), Dick Gregory, and many others. The final closing segment of the series, broadcast on June 25, 1965, featured Paar sitting alone on a stool, sharing a discussion that he had with his daughter Randy, who called Paar's departure a sabbatical. He said that his own field was, though not completely used up, \\"a little dry recently.\\" Then he called to his German Shepherd, which came to him from the seats of what was, for once, an empty studio, and walked out. (Johnny Carson used this format, without a dog, for his own farewell episode of The Tonight Show in 1992.) Paar continued to appear in occasional specials for the network until 1970. =Later career= Paar appears on Dick Cavett's show to announce his return to television in January 1973. In the late 1960s, Paar lived in Maine where he owned and operated television station WMTW, an ABC network affiliate in Poland Spring, Maine. Paar came back to television on a regular basis beginning in January 1973, with Jack Paar Tonite, which aired one week per month as one of several rotating shows on ABC's Wide World of Entertainment. Paar noted that it was the most he was willing to appear, and that he would not have appeared at all unless ABC had committed to keeping Dick Cavett, one of his former writers, on the air. Paar's announcer for this series was comic actress Peggy Cass, and perhaps its most notable aspect was the national television debut of comic Freddie Prinze. Paar stayed on the show, which was in direct competition with Tonight, for one year before he quit. Dissatisfied with the one-week-per-month formula, he complained that even his own mother did not know when he was on. Paar later expressed discomfort with developments in the television media and once said he had trouble interviewing people dressed in \\"overalls\\", a reference to young rock acts. In the 1980s and 1990s, Paar made rare guest appearances on Donahue, The Tonight Show (hosted by Johnny Carson, then Jay Leno), and Late Night with David Letterman, as well as on Charles Grodin's CNBC talk show. =Homophobic Rhetoric and Controversy= In his 1962 book, My Saber is Bent, Paar included Chapter Fourteen entitled \\"Fairies and Communists.\\" In the chapter, he wrote \\"There used to be a time when it looked like the Communists were taking over show business. Now it's fairies. They operate a lot alike, actually; both have a tendency to colonize. Just as there used to be no such thing as one Communist in a play or movie, now there is no such thing as one fairy. Where you find one, you usually find a baker's dozen swishing around.... When I hear that some fairy is producing or directing or acting in a play, I can often name some of the rest of the cast, even if I've never heard it.... The poor darlings, as they sometimes call themselves, are everywhere in show business. The theater is infested with them and it's beginning to show the effects. 'The New York theater is dying,' the late Ernie Kovacs complained recently, 'Killed by limp wrists.'\\" In addition to attacking gay men in theater and film, Paar also attacked gay men in the fashion industry: \\"I hope that all red-blooded men will rally to my crusade to have girls look like girls again. If we show our determination I'm sure that women will throw off the tyranny of fairy designers.\\" { In March 1973, during the run of Jack Paar Tonite, following protests from members of Gay Activists Alliance, Paar invited representatives of the organization on the show to explain why he \\"and other entertainers should not call homosexuals 'fairies,' 'dykes' and 'fags.'\\" =Retrospectives= Paar (left) with John F. Kennedy on The Tonight Show in 1959 In 1984, Paar came out of retirement once again for the Museum of Broadcasting's \\"Tribute to Jack Paar\\", produced by Kevin Doherty, making two live appearances in New York. This led to his 1986 NBC special Jack Paar Comes Home. The following year, a second special, Jack Paar Is Alive and Well, was broadcast by the network. Both were largely made up of black-and-white kinescoped clips used at the tribute from Tonight and from Paar's primetime program, to which he maintained the copyright. Although most of Paar's Tonight Shows were taped (in color from 1960), only a few moments are known to exist in this format. In 1997, PBS television devoted an edition of the American Masters series to Paar's career, and in 2003 revisited the topic with another hour-long examination of his work, entitled Smart Television. In the spring of 2004, a memorial for Paar was held at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City. Ron Simon, one of the museum's television and radio curators, was host and moderator, with appearances and speeches by television talk show host Dick Cavett, Turner Classic Movies (TCM) television host Robert Osborne, and Paar's daughter, Randy. Awards Paar was nominated for an Emmy award for Best Performance by a Continuing Character in a Musical or Variety Series in 1951, and nominated again in 1958 for an Emmy for Best Continuing Performance in a Series by a Comedian, Singer, Host, Dancer, M.C., Announcer, Narrator, or Panelist. He did not win either time. Personal life and death Paar was married twice to his first wife, Irene Paar (née Gubbins). After divorcing, the couple remarried in 1940 in Ohio, only to divorce again. He then married his second wife, Miriam Wagner, in 1943; and they remained together until his death. During the 1990s, Paar's health began to decline steadily. He had triple-bypass heart surgery in 1998 and suffered a stroke in 2003. The following year he died at his home in Greenwich, Connecticut with Miriam and their daughter Randy at his bedside. Paar's body was cremated, and his ashes were given to his family.

There were two exchanges of shots, but no injury save to Hogue's coat, through which Powlett sent a ball each time. *1846: Alexander Sprot and W. J. Campbell fought a duel over the border in South Australia (having been prevented from doing so in the Port Phillip District by a Magistrates' order). Both survived. *1851: Major Sir Thomas Mitchell confronted Sir Stuart Alexander Donaldson in Sydney. Mitchell issued the challenge because Donaldson had publicly criticised the cost of the Surveyor General's Department.

Baker informed the police who arrested Kingston in Adelaide's Victoria Square. =Canada= *1800: John White, 39, Upper Canada's first lawyer and a founder of the law society, was fatally shot on January 3, 1800, by a government official named John Small, who challenged him to the duel. White was alleged to have gossiped at a Christmas party that Mrs. Small was once the mistress of the Duke of Berkeley in England, who'd tired of her and paid Small to marry her and take her to the colonies. *1817: John Ridout, 18, was shot dead on July 12, 1817, at the corner of what is now Bay St. and Grosvenor St. in Toronto by Samuel Peters Jarvis, 25. The reason for the duel was unclear. On the count of two, the nervous Ridout discharged his pistol early, missing Jarvis by a wide margin. Ridout's second, James Small (whose father survived the only other duel in York) and Jarvis' second, Henry John Boulton insisted that Jarvis be allowed to make his shot. Ridout protested loudly and asked for another pistol, but Small and Boulton were adamant that the strict code of duelling must be observed. Jarvis shot and killed Ridout instantly. Jarvis was pardoned by the courts, even though he had shot an unarmed man. *1819: What historians have called \\"The Most Ferocious Duel\\" in Canadian history took place on April 11, 1819, at Windmill Point near the Lachine Canal. The opponents were William Caldwell, a doctor at the Montreal General Hospital, and Michael O'Sullivan, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. The dispute arose when Caldwell accused O'Sullivan of lacking courage. The two opponents exchanged fire an unheard-of five times. O'Sullivan was wounded twice in the process, and in the final volley, he took a bullet to the chest and hit the ground. Caldwell's arm was shattered by a shot; a hole in his collar proved he narrowly missed being shot in the neck. Amazingly, neither participant died during the fight, although both took a long time to recover. O'Sullivan went on to become Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench in Montreal, and when he died in 1839, an autopsy revealed a bullet still lodged against the middle of his spine. *1826: Rudkin versus Philpot a duel fought in Newfoundland at St. John's who met at West's Farm near Brine's Tavern at the foot of Robinson's Hill, adjacent to Brine's River to settle their seemingly long standing differences that was further exacerbated by the love of an Irish colleen who lived in a cottage near Quidi Vidi and a game of cards that ended in an argument over the ownership of the pot. *1833: The last fatal duel in Upper Canadalists a later fatal duel on 22 May 1838 at Verdun, Québec was fought in Perth, Ontario, on June 13, 1833. Two law students and former friends, John Wilson and Robert Lyon, quarrelled over remarks Lyon made about a local schoolteacher, Elizabeth Hughes. Lyon was killed in the second exchange of shots on a rain-soaked field. Wilson was acquitted of murder, eventually married Miss Hughes, became a Member of Parliament, and later a judge. *1836: Two duelling politicians from Lower Canada were lucky to have sensible seconds. Clément-Charles Sabrevois de Bleury, a member of the Lower Canadian Legislative Assembly, insulted fellow politician Charles-Ovide Perreault. Perreault then struck de Bleury, and a duel was set. Both men were determined to settle the matter with pistols, but their seconds came up with a unique solution. The two foes would clasp hands and de Bleury would say, \\"I am sorry to have insulted you\\" while at the same time Perreault would say, \\"I am sorry to have struck you.\\" They would then reply in unison, \\"I accept your apology.\\" The tactic worked, and the situation was resolved without injury. *1837: William Collis Meredith and James Scott. On Monday, 9 August 1837, at eight o’clock in the evening, Meredith (who had articled under the previously mentioned Clement-Charles Sabrevois de Bleury from 1831 to 1833) and Scott (no stranger to duels) stepped out to face one another on the slopes of Mount Royal, behind Montreal. Earlier that day, following a dispute over legal costs, Meredith had challenged Scott. Meredith chose James M. Blackwood to second him, whilst Scott's choice was Louis-Fereol Pelletier. The pistols used were Meredith's which he had bought in London, on a previous trip to England. On the first exchange Scott took a bullet high up in his thigh, and the duel was called to a stop. The bullet lodged itself in Scott's thigh bone in such a way that it could not be removed by doctors, which caused him great discomfort for the rest of his days. Ironically for Scott, this was exactly where he had shot Sweeney Campbell in a duel when they were students. In the early 1850s (Scott died in 1852), when both the adversaries had become judges, one of the sights then to see was Meredith helping his brother judge up the steep Court House steps, a result of the lameness in his leg that had remained with Scott since their encounter. Meredith was later knighted and went on to serve as Chief Justice of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec. *1840: Joseph Howe was called out by a member of Nova Scotian high society for his populist writing. When his opponent fired first and missed, Howe fired his shot in the air and won the right to refuse future challenges. *1873: The last duel in what is now Canada occurred in August 1873, in a field near St. John's, Newfoundland (which was not Canadian territory at the time). The duellists, Mr. Dooley and Mr. Healey, once friends, had fallen in love with the same young lady, and had quarrelled bitterly over her. One challenged the other to a duel, and they quickly arranged a time and place. No one else was present that morning except the two men's seconds. Dooley and Healey were determined to proceed in the 'honourable' way, but as they stood back-to-back with their pistols raised, they must have questioned what they were doing. Nerves gave way to terror as they slowly began pacing away from each other. When they had counted off the standard ten yards, they turned and fired. Dooley hit the ground immediately. Healey, believing he had killed Dooley, was seized with horror. But Dooley had merely fainted; the seconds confessed they had so feared the outcome that they loaded the pistols with blanks. Although this was a serious breach of duelling etiquette, both opponents gratefully agreed that honour had indeed been satisfied. =China= *During the Three Kingdoms period of China, in 195Zizhi Tongjian, Chapter 61, Han Annal 53, Emperor Xian of Han, the Second Year of Xingping warlord Sun Ce encountered an enemy general, named Taishi Ci, by accident when both of them were scouting the other. The two fought until the arrival of their men compelled them to break off. The result was that Sun Ce seized Taishi Ci's weapon while Taishi Ci grabbed Sun Ce's helmet. There was however no record that any one of them was injured in this duel. This is one of the few examples of two generals dueling during a time of war. *In the Eastern Han Dynasty, a military general, Guo Si (who served under the warlord Dong Zhuo) challenged another powerful military general, Lü Bu to a famous duel in the Battle of Chang'an. Guo Si was defeated after he was pierced by Lü Bu's spear. *In the Eastern Han Dynasty, two of Lü Bu's military officers, Hao Meng and Cao Xing engaged in an isolated combat.

Jarnac fooled La Châtaigneraie with a feint and hit him with a slash to the hamstrings. His dignity offended, La Châtaigneraie refused medical aid, and died. This both ended the practice of trial by combat in France, and created the myth of \\"Le Coup de Jarnac\\" – a legendary strike that supposedly allowed amateurs to defeat masters. *27 April 1578: Duel of the Mignons claims the lives of two favorites of Henry III of France and two favorites of Henry I, Duke of Guise. *12 May 1627: at the Place Royale in Paris, François de Montmorency-Bouteville dueled François d'Harcourt Beuvron without fatality, but Montmorency- Bouteville's second, François de Rosmadec, Comte de Chappelles, dueled and killed Beuvron's second, the Marquis de Bussi d'Amboise. While Beuvron took refuge in England, Montmorency and Rosmadec, despite their nobility, were beheaded at the Place de Grève in Paris on 22 June 1627. *1641: Kenelm Digby and a French nobleman named Mont le Ros. Digby, a founding member of the Royal Society, was attending a banquet in France when the Frenchman insulted King Charles I of England and Digby challenged him to a duel.

The frustrated Manet collared Duranty at the Café Guerbois and slapped him. Duranty's demands for an apology were refused and so the men fought a duel with swords in the Forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye three days later on the 23rd. Émile Zola acted as Manet's second and Paul Alexis acted for Duranty. After Duranty received a wound above the right breast the seconds stepped in and declared that honour had been satisfied. The men remained friends despite the encounter. *1888: General Georges Boulanger and Charles Floquet (Prime Minister of the French Republic); the General was wounded in the throat but survived. *5 February 1897: Marcel Proust fought journalist Jean Lorrain, after Lorrain published an excoriating review of Proust's first book \\"Pleasures and Days\\" and hinted that Proust was having an affair with Madame Alphonse Daudet's son, Lucien. Proust and Lorrain exchanged shots at 25 paces. Proust fired first, his bullet hitting the ground by Lorrain's foot. Lorrain's shot missed, and the seconds agreed that honor had been satisfied. * 7 October 1949. Film director Willy Rozier challenged film critic Francois Chalais over comments Chalais had made about actress Marie Dea in Rozier's 1949 film 56 Rue Pigalle. Fought with rapiers in a forest, and to first blood, not death, Rozier wounded Chalais in the right forearm in the third round, winning the encounter in front of a dozen journalists and photographers.https://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1949/10/08/un-duel-de- cinema_1924477_1819218.html The film would go on to become a hit in France, vindicating Rozier further. Silent film footage of the arrangements being made for the fight in an Parisian alley, and of the duel itself, are included as an extra on the DVD release of the film. *20 April 1949: Duel between Armand Fevre and Pierre Merindol. *21 April 1967: The last official duel in the history of France happened between Gaston Defferre and René Ribière, both delegates at the French National Assembly.

Martin, in his place in the House of Commons, had alluded to Wilkes as a \\"stabber in the dark, a cowardly and malignant scoundrel.\\" Wilkes prided himself as much upon his gallantry as upon his wit and loyalty, and lost no time in calling Martin out. The challenge was given as soon as the House adjourned, and the parties repaired at once to a copse in Hyde Park with a brace of pistols. They fired four times, when Wilkes fell, wounded in the abdomen. His antagonist, relenting, hastened up and insisted on helping him off the ground; but Wilkes, with comparative courtesy, as strenuously urged Martin to hurry away, so as to escape arrest. It afterwards appeared that Martin had been practising in a shooting gallery for six months before making the obnoxious speech in the House; and soon after, instead of being arrested, he received a valuable appointment from the ministry.'Hyde Park', Old and New London: Volume 4 (1878), pp. 375–405.

John Gibson Lockhart had been abusing many of Scott's contributors in Blackwood's Magazine (under a pseudonym (Z), as was then common). In May 1820, Scott began a series of counter-articles, which provoked Lockhart into calling him \\"a liar and a scoundrel\\". In February 1820, Lockhart's London agent, J.H. Christie, made a provocative statement, and Scott challenged him. They met on 16 February 1821, at a farm between Camden Town and Hampstead. Christie did not fire in the first round, but there was a misunderstanding between the seconds, resulting in a second round. Scott was hit in the abdomen, and died 11 days later.

Orlov, having harsh shooting skills, missed twice from twelve steps (first shot, however, hit Lunin's epaulette, and second holed his hat), while Lunin, being a notable marksman, kept stiff upper lip and also missed twice on purpose – shooting upwards in the skies, he then taught the Prince in French language, how to aim and squeeze the trigger properly, laughing at infuriated nobleman during the process. Third shot never happened. Details are still debated. *1808: Gen. Nikolay Tuchkov was challenged by Prince Mikhail Dologukov. It happened amidst the Finnish War, so Tuchkov proposed to Dolgorukov, who also has the rank of a general, instead of conventional duel, to make joint appearance on the frontline, so a seldom enemy bullet could justify the argument. So was their decision, and Dolgorukov has been killed soon by a cannonball flown from Swedish lines. *1814: Congress of Vienna: The Coalition's stubborn refusal to hand over all of Poland to Russia leads a tense Tsar Alexander I of Russia to supposedly challenge Metternich to a duel.

Yet Mackenna was able to run away from the duels both times). They dueled at night, in the first round, Mackenna shot at his head, but missed and blew Carrera's hat away, in the second round, Carrera was able to hit Mackenna in his hand, blowing his thumb away and piercing a hole in his throat, thus killing Mackenna. Carrera was arrested the next day, particularly because Mackenna was part of a secret society called Lautaro Lodge, which had the control of the government at the time. *November 3, 1968, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Ramadan's offer included the possibility that a group of US officials would face off with a group of Iraqi officials of same or similar rank (President v. President, Vice President v. Vice President, etc.). Ramadan proposed that the duel be held in a neutral land, with each party using the same weapons, and with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan presiding as the supervisor.

It narrates the story of two peasants who agree to escort a man and a woman across enemy lines in return for gold without knowing that he is a general and the woman is a princess. The film stars Toshiro Mifune as General and Misa Uehara as Princess Yuki while the role of the peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, are portrayed by Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara respectively. Plot Two bedraggled peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, intend to join the feudal Yamana clan in battle, but having arrived too late, are taken for soldiers of the defeated Akizuki clan, and forced to bury the dead. After quarreling and splitting up, the two are both again captured separately and forced to dig for gold in the Akizuki castle with other prisoners. After a prisoner uprising, Tahei and Matashichi escape. Near a river they find gold marked with the crescent of the Akizuki clan. Planning to evade the Yamana soldiers who are preventing refugees and defeated Akizuki clansmen from crossing the frontier to Hayakawa, the peasants encounter a mysterious man who takes them to a hidden Akizuki fortress. Unbeknownst to them, the man is a general of the defeated Akizuki clan, Makabe Rokurōta. Although Rokurōta was planning on killing the peasants, on hearing their plan, he decides it is so ingenious, he will let them live. They will travel to Yamana itself and then pass into Hayakawa through a different border. Rokurōta decides, without revealing anything to the peasants, to move the Akizuki Princess Yuki to Hayakawa, whose lord is an ally of the Akizuki clan. Rokurōta escorts Princess Yuki and what remains of her family's gold to Hayakawa, with Matashichi and Tahei traveling with them. In order to keep her identity secret, Yuki poses as a mute so that she doesn't inadvertently speak in the usual mode characteristic of a noblewoman. During their travels, the peasants impede their progress and sometimes try to seize the gold. They are later joined by a farmer’s daughter, whom they acquire from an innkeeper. They avoid being captured on one occasion by Rokurōta killing four soldiers of a Yamana patrol, including two soldiers Rokurōta has to pursue on horseback. However, Rokurōta ends up in a Yamana camp, where the general in charge is Rokurōta's friendly rival, Hyoe Tadokoro. Tadokoro states that he is sorry he didn't face Rokurōta in battle and decides to have a lance duel, which Rokurōta wins, but Rokurōta refuses to kill Tadokoro. Rokurōta tells Tadokoro they'll meet again and then leaves the camp on horseback to get back to the Princess. Eventually, they are captured by Yamana soldiers close to a post on the Hayakawa border and held prisoner to be executed. In the confusion, Matashichi and Tahei are able to hide and avoid being taken prisoner. Tadokoro comes to identify the prisoners before the soldiers take them to be executed. Tadokoro shows a large face scar and explains it is a result of a beating ordered by the Yamana lord for losing the duel with Rokurōta. The Princess proclaims that, even facing death, she has enjoyed the trip and getting to know humanity's ugliness and beauty closely. The next day as the soldiers start marching the prisoners to be executed, Tadokoro suddenly defects to the Akizuki side with the Princess, Rokurōta and the farmer's daughter. The group manages to escape along with the horses carrying the gold. After the Princess and Rokurōta's escape, Matashichi and Tahei stumble upon the gold which is carried by the horses, but are then arrested by Hayakawa soldiers. The soldiers take the peasants to see the general, whereupon Rokurōta explains Yuki's true identity, and states that all of the gold will be used to restore her family's domain. The peasants are then released, taking a single ryō. Finally, Tahei gives this to Matashichi to protect; but Matashichi allows Tahei to keep it.

The film was the highest-grossing film for Toho in 1958, ranking as the fourth overall highest-grossing films in Japan that year. In box-office terms, The Hidden Fortress was Kurosawa’s most successful film, until the 1961 release of Yojimbo. The film was released theatrically in the United States by Toho International Col. with English subtitles. It was screened in San Francisco on November 1959 and received a wider release on October 6, 1960 with a 126-minute running time. The film was re-issued in the United States in 1962 with a 90-minute running time. The film which was compared unfavorably to Rashomon (1950) and Seven Samurai (1954) performed poorly at U.S. box office. Critical reception An article published in The New York Times on January 24, 1962, had the film's review by prominent journalist Bosley Crowther who called The Hidden Fortess a superficial film. He said He mentioned that Kurosawa, for all his talent, is as prone to pot boiling as anyone else. Writing for The Criterion Collection in 1987, David Ehrenstein called it \\"one of the greatest action-adventure films ever made\\" and a \\"fast-paced, witty and visually stunning\\" samurai film. According to Ehrenstein: > The battle on the steps in Chapter 2 (anticipating the climax of Ran) is as > visually overwhelming as any of the similar scenes in Griffith's > Intolerance. The use of composition in depth in the fortress scene in > Chapter 4 is likewise as arresting as the best of Eisenstein or David Lean. > Toshiro Mifune's muscular demonstrations of heroic derring-do in the horse- > charge scene (Chapter 11) and the scrupulously choreographed spear duel that > follows it (Chapter 12) is in the finest tradition of Douglas Fairbanks. > Overall, there’s a sense of sheer \\"movieness\\" to The Hidden Fortress that > places it plainly in the ranks of such grand adventure entertainments as > Gunga Din, The Thief of Baghdad, and Fritz Lang's celebrated diptych The > Tiger of Eschnapur and The Hindu Tomb. David Parkinson of the Empire on a review posted on January 1, 2000, gave the film four out of five stars and wrote \\"Somewhat overshadowed by the likes of Seven Samurai, this is a vigorously placed, meticulously staged adventure. It's not top drawer, but still ranks among the best of Kurosawa's minor masterpieces.\\" Writing for The Criterion Collection in 2001, Armond White said \\"The Hidden Fortress holds a place in cinema history comparable to John Ford's Stagecoach: It lays out the plot and characters of an on-the-road epic of self-discovery and heroic action. In a now-familiar fashion, Rokurōta and Princess Yuki fight their way to allied territory, accompanied by a scheming, greedy comic duo who get surprised by their own good fortune. Kurosawa always balances valor and greed, seriousness and humor, while depicting the misfortunes of war.\\" Upon the film's UK re-release in 2002, Jamie Russell, reviewing the film for the BBC, said it \\"effortlessly intertwines action, drama, and comedy\\", calling it \\"both cracking entertainment and a wonderful piece of cinema.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian made a review on February 1, 2002. According to him: > Revered now as an inspiration for George Lucas, Kurosawa's amiable, > forthright epic romance happens on a scorched, rugged landscape which looks > quiet a lot like an alien planet. At other times, the movie plays like > nothing so much as a roistering comedy western. But it has a cleverly > contrived relationship between the principals, including a fantastically > brash and virile Toshiro Mifune. The comedy co-exists with a dark view of > live's brevity, and Kurosawa devises exhilarating setpieces and captivating > images. Arthouse classics aren't usually as welcoming and entertaining as > this. Variety called it \\"a long, interesting, humour-laden picture in medieval Japan\\". Performances of the lead actors, Kurosawa's direction and Ichio Yamazaki's camerawork were praised. The film has an aggregate of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 31 critic reviews. Awards The film won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 9th Berlin International Film Festival in 1959. Kinema Junpo awarded Shinobu Hashimoto the award for Best Screenwriter for his work on the film and for Tadashi Imai's Night Drum and Yoshitaro Nomura's Harikomi. Legacy =Influence= George Lucas has acknowledged the heavy influence of The Hidden Fortress on Star Wars, particularly in the technique of telling the story from the perspective of the film's lowliest characters, C-3PO and R2-D2.Star Wars DVD audio commentary Lucas's original plot outline for Star Wars also had a strong resemblance to the plot of The Hidden Fortress, which would be reused for The Phantom Menace. A number of plot elements from The Hidden Fortress are used in the 2006 video game Final Fantasy XII. The Japanese-inspired video game Shogo: Mobile Armor Division (1998) features a level called \\"The Hidden Fortress\\", one of many tributes (including a level called \\"High and Low\\") to Kurosawa in the game. =Remake= A loose remake entitled Kakushi Toride no San-Akunin: The Last Princess was directed by Shinji Higuchi and released on May 10, 2008.

The two simplest of these are called series and parallel and occur frequently. Components connected in series are connected along a single conductive path, so the same current flows through all of the components but voltage is dropped (lost) across each of the resistances. In a series circuit, the sum of the voltages consumed by each individual resistance is equal to the source voltage. Components connected in parallel are connected along multiple paths so that the current can split up; the same voltage is applied to each component. A circuit composed solely of components connected in series is known as a series circuit; likewise, one connected completely in parallel is known as a parallel circuit. In a series circuit, the current that flows through each of the components is the same, and the voltage across the circuit is the sum of the individual voltage drops across each component. In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each of the components is the same, and the total current is the sum of the currents flowing through each component. Consider a very simple circuit consisting of four light bulbs and a 12-volt automotive battery. If a wire joins the battery to one bulb, to the next bulb, to the next bulb, to the next bulb, then back to the battery in one continuous loop, the bulbs are said to be in series. If each bulb is wired to the battery in a separate loop, the bulbs are said to be in parallel. If the four light bulbs are connected in series, the same current flows through all of them and the voltage drop is 3-volts across each bulb, which may not be sufficient to make them glow. If the light bulbs are connected in parallel, the currents through the light bulbs combine to form the current in the battery, while the voltage drop is 12-volts across each bulb and they all glow. In a series circuit, every device must function for the circuit to be complete. If one bulb burns out in a series circuit, the entire circuit is broken. In parallel circuits, each light bulb has its own circuit, so all but one light could be burned out, and the last one will still function. Series circuits Series circuits are sometimes referred to as current-coupled or daisy chain-coupled. The current in a series circuit goes through every component in the circuit. Therefore, all of the components in a series connection carry the same current. A series circuit has only one path in which its current can flow. Opening or breaking a series circuit at any point causes the entire circuit to \\"open\\" or stop operating. For example, if even one of the light bulbs in an older-style string of Christmas tree lights burns out or is removed, the entire string becomes inoperable until the bulb is replaced. =Current= : I = I_1 = I_2 = \\\\cdots = I_n In a series circuit, the current is the same for all of the elements. =Voltage= In a series circuit, the voltage is the sum of the voltage drops of the individual components (resistance units). : V = V_1 + V_2 + \\\\dots + V_n =Resistance units= The total resistance of two or more resistors connected in series is equal to the sum of their individual resistances: This is a diagram of several resistors, connected end to end, with the same amount of current through each. :R_\\\\text{total} = R_\\\\text{s} = R_1 + R_2 + \\\\cdots + R_n Rs=>Resistance in series Electrical conductance presents a reciprocal quantity to resistance. Total conductance of a series circuits of pure resistances, therefore, can be calculated from the following expression: :\\\\frac{1}{G_\\\\mathrm{total}} = \\\\frac{1}{G_1} + \\\\frac{1}{G_2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{G_n}. For a special case of two resistances in series, the total conductance is equal to: :G_\\\\text{total} = \\\\frac{G_1 G_2}{G_1+G_2}. =Inductors= Inductors follow the same law, in that the total inductance of non-coupled inductors in series is equal to the sum of their individual inductances: A diagram of several inductors, connected end to end, with the same amount of current going through each. :L_\\\\mathrm{total} = L_1 + L_2 + \\\\cdots + L_n However, in some situations, it is difficult to prevent adjacent inductors from influencing each other, as the magnetic field of one device coupled with the windings of its neighbours. This influence is defined by the mutual inductance M. For example, if two inductors are in series, there are two possible equivalent inductances depending on how the magnetic fields of both inductors influence each other. When there are more than two inductors, the mutual inductance between each of them and the way the coils influence each other complicates the calculation. For a larger number of coils the total combined inductance is given by the sum of all mutual inductances between the various coils including the mutual inductance of each given coil with itself, which we term self-inductance or simply inductance. For three coils, there are six mutual inductances M_{12}, M_{13}, M_{23} and M_{21}, M_{31} and M_{32}. There are also the three self-inductances of the three coils: M_{11}, M_{22} and M_{33}. Therefore :L_\\\\mathrm{total} = (M_{11} + M_{22} + M_{33}) + (M_{12} + M_{13} + M_{23}) + (M_{21} + M_{31} + M_{32}) By reciprocity, M_{ij} = M_{ji} so that the last two groups can be combined. The first three terms represent the sum of the self-inductances of the various coils. The formula is easily extended to any number of series coils with mutual coupling. The method can be used to find the self-inductance of large coils of wire of any cross- sectional shape by computing the sum of the mutual inductance of each turn of wire in the coil with every other turn since in such a coil all turns are in series. =Capacitors= Capacitors follow the same law using the reciprocals. The total capacitance of capacitors in series is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of their individual capacitances: A diagram of several capacitors, connected end to end, with the same amount of current going through each. :\\\\frac{1}{C_\\\\mathrm{total}} = \\\\frac{1}{C_1} + \\\\frac{1}{C_2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{C_n}. =Switches= Two or more switches in series form a logical AND; the circuit only carries current if all switches are closed. See AND gate. =Cells and batteries= A battery is a collection of electrochemical cells. If the cells are connected in series, the voltage of the battery will be the sum of the cell voltages. For example, a 12 volt car battery contains six 2-volt cells connected in series. Some vehicles, such as trucks, have two 12 volt batteries in series to feed the 24-volt system. Parallel circuits If two or more components are connected in parallel, they have the same difference of potential (voltage) across their ends. The potential differences across the components are the same in magnitude, and they also have identical polarities. The same voltage is applied to all circuit components connected in parallel. The total current is the sum of the currents through the individual components, in accordance with Kirchhoff's current law. =Voltage= In a parallel circuit, the voltage is the same for all elements. : V = V_1 = V_2 = \\\\ldots = V_n =Current= The current in each individual resistor is found by Ohm's law. Factoring out the voltage gives :I_\\\\mathrm{total} = V\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\\\frac{1}{R_2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{R_n}\\\\right). =Resistance units= To find the total resistance of all components, add the reciprocals of the resistances R_i of each component and take the reciprocal of the sum. Total resistance will always be less than the value of the smallest resistance: A diagram of several resistors, side by side, both leads of each connected to the same wires. :\\\\frac{1}{R_\\\\mathrm{total}} = \\\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\\\frac{1}{R_2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{R_n}. For only two resistances, the unreciprocated expression is reasonably simple: :R_\\\\mathrm{total} = \\\\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1 + R_2} . This sometimes goes by the mnemonic product over sum. For N equal resistances in parallel, the reciprocal sum expression simplifies to: :\\\\frac{1}{R_\\\\mathrm{total}} = N \\\\frac{1}{R}. and therefore to: :R_\\\\mathrm{total} = \\\\frac{R}{N}. To find the current in a component with resistance R_i, use Ohm's law again: :I_i = \\\\frac{V}{R_i}\\\\,. The components divide the current according to their reciprocal resistances, so, in the case of two resistors, :\\\\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \\\\frac{R_2}{R_1}. An old term for devices connected in parallel is multiple, such as multiple connections for arc lamps. Since electrical conductance G is reciprocal to resistance, the expression for total conductance of a parallel circuit of resistors reads: :G_\\\\mathrm{total} = G_1 + G_2 + \\\\cdots + G_n. The relations for total conductance and resistance stand in a complementary relationship: the expression for a series connection of resistances is the same as for parallel connection of conductances, and vice versa. =Inductors= Inductors follow the same law, in that the total inductance of non-coupled inductors in parallel is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of their individual inductances: A diagram of several inductors, side by side, both leads of each connected to the same wires. :\\\\frac{1}{L_\\\\mathrm{total}} = \\\\frac{1}{L_1} + \\\\frac{1}{L_2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{L_n}. If the inductors are situated in each other's magnetic fields, this approach is invalid due to mutual inductance. If the mutual inductance between two coils in parallel is M, the equivalent inductor is: :\\\\frac{1}{L_\\\\mathrm{total}} = \\\\frac{L_1 + L_2 - 2M}{L_1L_2 - M^2 } If L_1 = L_2 : L_\\\\text{total} = \\\\frac{L + M}{2} The sign of M depends on how the magnetic fields influence each other. For two equal tightly coupled coils the total inductance is close to that of every single coil. If the polarity of one coil is reversed so that M is negative, then the parallel inductance is nearly zero or the combination is almost non-inductive. It is assumed in the \\"tightly coupled\\" case M is very nearly equal to L. However, if the inductances are not equal and the coils are tightly coupled there can be near short circuit conditions and high circulating currents for both positive and negative values of M, which can cause problems. More than three inductors become more complex and the mutual inductance of each inductor on each other inductor and their influence on each other must be considered. For three coils, there are three mutual inductances M_{12}, M_{13} and M_{23}. This is best handled by matrix methods and summing the terms of the inverse of the L matrix (3 by 3 in this case). The pertinent equations are of the form: v_{i}=\\\\sum_{j} L_{i,j}\\\\frac{di_{j}}{dt} =Capacitors= The total capacitance of capacitors in parallel is equal to the sum of their individual capacitances: A diagram of several capacitors, side by side, both leads of each connected to the same wires. :C_\\\\mathrm{total} = C_1 + C_2 + \\\\cdots + C_n. The working voltage of a parallel combination of capacitors is always limited by the smallest working voltage of an individual capacitor. =Switches= Two or more switches in parallel form a logical OR; the circuit carries current if at least one switch is closed. See OR gate. =Cells and batteries= If the cells of a battery are connected in parallel, the battery voltage will be the same as the cell voltage, but the current supplied by each cell will be a fraction of the total current. For example, if a battery comprises four identical cells connected in parallel and delivers a current of 1 ampere, the current supplied by each cell will be 0.25 ampere. If the cells are not identical, cells with higher voltages will attempt to charge those with lower ones, potentially damaging them. Parallel-connected batteries were widely used to power the valve filaments in portable radios. Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries (particularly laptop batteries) are often connected in parallel to increase the ampere-hour rating. Some solar electric systems have batteries in parallel to increase the storage capacity; a close approximation of total amp-hours is the sum of all amp-hours of in-parallel batteries. Combining conductances From Kirchhoff's circuit laws we can deduce the rules for combining conductances. For two conductances G_1 and G_2 in parallel, the voltage across them is the same and from Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) the total current is : I_\\\\text{eq} = I_1 + I_2.\\\\ \\\\, Substituting Ohm's law for conductances gives : G_\\\\text{eq} V = G_1 V + G_2 V\\\\ \\\\, and the equivalent conductance will be, : G_\\\\text{eq} = G_1 + G_2.\\\\ \\\\, For two conductances G_1 and G_2 in series the current through them will be the same and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law tells us that the voltage across them is the sum of the voltages across each conductance, that is, : V_\\\\text{eq} = V_1 + V_2.\\\\ \\\\, Substituting Ohm's law for conductance then gives, : \\\\frac{I}{G_\\\\text{eq}} = \\\\frac{I}{G_1} + \\\\frac{I}{G_2} which in turn gives the formula for the equivalent conductance, : \\\\frac{1}{G_\\\\text{eq}} = \\\\frac{1}{G_1} + \\\\frac{1}{G_2}. This equation can be rearranged slightly, though this is a special case that will only rearrange like this for two components. : G_\\\\text{eq} = \\\\frac{G_1 G_2}{G_1 + G_2}. Notation The value of two components in parallel is often represented in equations by the parallel operator, two vertical lines (∥), borrowing the parallel lines notation from geometry. :R_\\\\mathrm{eq} \\\\equiv R_1 \\\\parallel R_2 \\\\equiv \\\\left(R_1^{-1} + R_2^{-1}\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} This simplifies expressions that would otherwise become complicated by expansion of the terms. For instance: :R_1 \\\\parallel R_2 \\\\parallel R_3 \\\\equiv \\\\frac{R_1 R_2 R_3}{R_1 R_2 + R_1 R_3 + R_2 R_3}. Applications A common application of series circuit in consumer electronics is in batteries, where several cells connected in series are used to obtain a convenient operating voltage. Two disposable zinc cells in series might power a flashlight or remote control at 3 volts; the battery pack for a hand-held power tool might contain a dozen lithium-ion cells wired in series to provide 48 volts. Series circuits were formerly used for lighting in electric multiple units trains. For example, if the supply voltage was 600 volts there might be eight 70-volt bulbs in series (total 560 volts) plus a resistor to drop the remaining 40 volts. Series circuits for train lighting were superseded, first by motor-generators, then by solid state devices. Series resistance can also be applied to the arrangement of blood vessels within a given organ. Each organ is supplied by a large artery, smaller arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and veins arranged in series. The total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances, as expressed by the following equation: Rtotal = Rartery \\\\+ Rarterioles \\\\+ Rcapillaries. The largest proportion of resistance in this series is contributed by the arterioles. Parallel resistance is illustrated by the circulatory system. Each organ is supplied by an artery that branches off the aorta. The total resistance of this parallel arrangement is expressed by the following equation: 1/Rtotal = 1/Ra \\\\+ 1/Rb \\\\+ ... 1/Rn. Ra, Rb, and Rn are the resistances of the renal, hepatic, and other arteries respectively. The total resistance is less than the resistance of any of the individual arteries.

The exhibition is between two teams organized solely for the event, usually representing the league's teams based on region or division, but sometimes dividing the players by an attribute such as nationality. Selection of the players may be done by a vote of the coaches and/or news media; in professional leagues, fans may vote on some or all of the roster. An all-star game usually occurs at the midpoint of the regular season. An exception is American football's Pro Bowl, which occurs at the end of the season. All-star games are usually organized like regular games, but are often played with less emphasis on victory. Competing goals are to give many players time in the game and to avoid injury. In ice hockey, for example, there is no serious checking, while in American football no blitzing is allowed. In basketball, there is virtually no defense played until the final quarter. However, the Australian State of Origin series does involve physicality that often leads to on-field scuffles. The current format of the NHL All-Star Game differs significantly from that of normal league games. Instead of a single game, the event is organized as a four-team knockout tournament, with each team representing one of the league's divisions. Additionally, each game within the event is contested as a single 20-minute period, making the playing time of the All-Star Game identical to that of a regulation NHL game. The most radical difference is the on-ice team composition—instead of five skaters and one goaltender at full strength, each team has three skaters and a goaltender. Due to the reduced team sizes, penalties that normally cause the penalized team to lose a skater instead give the non-penalized team an extra skater. The term \\"all-star\\" is mainly used in North America. All-star games are rare in international sports (such as association football) where games between national teams are more popular than all-star games would be. In the United Kingdom, all-star teams are usually denoted with the Roman numeral corresponding to the number of players allowed on the field – for example, a soccer or cricket XI, a rugby league XIII and a rugby union XV. Major League Baseball organized the first professional league all-star game as part of the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago. It was the brainchild of Arch Ward, then sports editor for The Chicago Tribune.\\"All-Star Game History\\", Baseball Almanac. Initially intended to be a one-time event, its great success resulted in playing the game annually. Ward's contribution was recognized by Major League Baseball in 1962 with the creation of the \\"Arch Ward Trophy\\", given to the All-Star Game's most valuable player each year.Newman, Mark. \\"All-Star MVP Awaits Your Vote\\", MLB.com, July 10, 2006. Professional all-star games = North America =  Major leagues  * Major League Baseball All-Star Game (National League vs. American League) * National Basketball Association All-Star Game ** The game has had two formats throughout its history: *** The original format used from the first game in 1951 until 2017 pitted Eastern Conference and Western Conference all-star teams. *** Since 2018, it has followed a fantasy draft format, similar to the 2011–2015 format of the NHL All-Star Game (see below), involving the selection of players by a combination of fan, player, and media voting. The vote leaders for each conferences are then named as team captains for each all-star team, who then select players from the rest of the all-stars, regardless of the conference they play in. * National Hockey League All-Star Game ** The game has had a number of formats throughout its history: *** The original format, used from 1947 through 1968 with two exceptions, saw the previous season's Stanley Cup champions take on an \\"All-Star\\" team made up of the First and Second NHL All-Star Teams plus other star players. *** In 1951 and 1952, the competing teams were the First NHL All-Star Team, supplemented with stars from the league's American franchises, and the Second NHL All-Star Team, supplemented with stars from Canadian franchises. *** Beginning in 1969 and continuing through 2009, with some exceptions, the format was geographic—most recently Eastern Conference vs. Western Conference. *** For 1979 and 1987, a single team comprising the NHL's best players faced the Soviet national ice hockey team in a two-game series. *** From 1998 through 2002, the teams were divided by player nationality, with a \\"North America\\" team made up of Canadians and Americans and a \\"World\\" team drawn from the rest of the world. *** In 2006, 2010 and 2014, the league did not hold an all-star game, instead releasing its players to play ice hockey at the Olympic Games. The league held an all-star game in addition to releasing its players for the Olympics in 1998 and 2002. *** Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout cancelling the entire season, the All-Star Game was not held in 2005. In 2013, the league did not hold an all- star game as well, as it omitted from the schedule because of the shortened season caused by the player lockout. *** From 2011 to 2015, a fantasy draft took place that involved the selection of 42 players—six in fan voting, and the other 36 by the league. The selected players then chose two of these individuals as team captains. *** From 2016 onward, the \\"All-Star Game\\" consists of a mini-tournament where teams representing the league's divisions compete against each other in abbreviated games lasting only 20 minutes (instead of the three 20-minute periods of normal NHL games). * National Football League Pro Bowl ** From 1938 to 1942, the NFL held an all-star game with the winner of that year's NFL Championship Game against an all-star team composed of players from the other teams (and, at least once, teams outside the NFL). ** From 1951 to 2013, the Pro Bowl followed an inter-conference format (Eastern vs. Western from 1951 to 1969 and American Football Conference vs. National Football Conference since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970). The AFC vs NFC format was restored in 2017. ** From 2014 to 2016 it followed a draft format, similar to the 2011–2015 format of the NHL All-Star Game (see above). :Note: In professional American football, the term \\"all-star game\\" can also refer to the American Football League All-Star game, played from 1961 to 1969; or the College All-Star Game, played from 1934 to 1976. * Major League Soccer All-Star Game ** The game has had several formats throughout its history: *** Originally, the game pitted Eastern Conference and Western Conference all-star teams. This format was used for all games save one from 1996 through 2001, and also in 2004. *** The 1998 game pitted an \\"MLS USA\\" team, consisting entirely of Americans, against an \\"MLS World\\" team drawn from all other nationalities. *** The 2002 game matched an MLS all-star team against the US national team. *** The 2003 game was the first in which an MLS all-star team played a visiting foreign club team. This format was used through the 2019 edition, with the exception of 2004. In the 2003 game, the visiting team was from Mexico; from 2005–2019, the visiting team was based in Europe. *** The 2020 game will be the first with a new format, involving all-star teams from both MLS and Mexico's top league, Liga MX. * Monster Energy NASCAR All-Star Race (Race winners from previous and current season, as well as Cup champions and All-Star Race winners from the previous 10 seasons) * WNBA All-Star Game (usually Eastern Conference vs. Western Conference) ** In 2004 and 2010, the East-West format was not followed; instead, the USA national team faced a team of WNBA all-stars. The league does not consider these games to be official All-Star Games. ** From 2008 forward, no All-Star Game has been played in any Olympic year. ** Since 2018, the All-Star Game has used a draft format similar to that used by the NHL in the 2011–2015 period. In the WNBA's implementation, fan voting determines the two team captains (though in the first game under the current format, Maya Moore declined the captain's role).

It is situated between Poole and Bridport on the A35 trunk route. An historic market town, Dorchester is on the banks of the River Frome to the south of the Dorset Downs and north of the South Dorset Ridgeway that separates the area from Weymouth, to the south. The civil parish includes the small town of Poundbury and the suburb of Fordington. The area around the town was first settled in prehistoric times. The Romans established a garrison there after defeating the Durotriges tribe, calling the settlement that grew up nearby Durnovaria; they built an aqueduct to supply water and an amphitheatre on an ancient British earthwork. After the departure of the Romans, the town diminished in significance, but during the medieval period became an important commercial and political centre. It was the site of the \\"Bloody Assizes\\" presided over by Judge Jeffreys after the Monmouth Rebellion, and later the trial of the Tolpuddle Martyrs. In the 2011 census, the population of Dorchester was 19,060, with further people coming from surrounding areas to work in the town which has six industrial estates. The Brewery Square redevelopment project is taking place in phases, with other development projects planned. The town has a land-based college, Kingston Maurward College, The Thomas Hardye School, three middle schools and thirteen first schools. The Dorset County Hospital offers an accident and emergency service, and the town is served by two railway stations. Through vehicular traffic is routed round the town by means of a bypass. The town has a football club and a rugby union club, several museums and the biannual Dorchester Festival. It is twinned with three towns in Europe. As well as having many listed buildings, a number of notable people have been associated with the town. It was for many years the home and inspiration of the author Thomas Hardy, whose novel The Mayor of Casterbridge uses a fictionalised version of Dorchester as its setting. History =Prehistory and Romano-British= Dorchester's roots stem back to prehistoric times. The earliest settlements were about southwest of the modern town centre in the vicinity of Maiden Castle, a large Iron Age hill fort that was one of the most powerful settlements in pre-Roman Britain. Different tribes lived there from 4000 BC. The Durotriges were likely to have been there when the Romans arrived in Britain in 43 AD. The Romans defeated the local tribes by 70 AD and established a garrison that became the town the Romans named Durnovaria, a Brythonic name incorporating durn, \\"fist\\", loosely interpreted as 'place with fist-sized pebbles'. It appears to have taken part of its name from the local Durotriges tribe who inhabited the area. Durnovaria was recorded in the 4th- century Antonine Itinerary and became a market centre for the surrounding countryside, an important road junction and staging post, and subsequently one of the twin capitals of the Celtic Durotriges tribe. The remains of the Roman walls that surrounded the town can still be seen. The majority have been replaced by pathways that form a square inside modern Dorchester known as 'The Walks'. A small segment of the original wall remains near the Top 'o Town roundabout. Roman town house near County Hall, showing the underfloor heating system Other Roman remains include part of the town walls and the foundations of a town house near the county hall. Modern building works within the walls have unearthed Roman finds; in 1936 a cache of 22,000 3rd-century Roman coins was discovered in South Street. Other Roman finds include silver and copper coins known as Dorn pennies, a gold ring, a bronze figure of the Roman god Mercury and large areas of tessellated pavement. The County Museum contains many Roman artefacts. The Romans built an aqueduct to supply the town with water. It was rediscovered in 1900 as the remains of a channel cut into the chalk and contouring round the hills. The source is believed to be the River Frome at Notton, about upstream from Dorchester. Near the town centre is Maumbury Rings, an ancient British henge earthwork converted by the Romans for use as an amphitheatre, and to the north west is Poundbury Hill, another pre- Roman fortification. Little evidence exists to suggest continued occupation after the withdrawal of the Roman administration from Britain. The name Durnovaria survived into Old Welsh as Durngueir, recorded by Asser in the 9th century. The area remained in British hands until the mid-7th century and there was continuity of use of the Roman cemetery at nearby Poundbury. Dorchester has been suggested as the centre of a sub-kingdom of Dumnonia or other regional power base. =Medieval= One of the first raids of the Viking era may have taken place near Dorchester around 790. According to a chronicler, the King's reeve assembled a few men and sped to meet them thinking that they were merchants from another country. When he arrived at their location, he admonished them and instructed that they should be brought to the royal town. The Vikings then slaughtered him and his men.Studies in the Early History of Shaftesbury Abbey. Dorset County Council, 1999 – 'King Alfred the Great and Shaftesbury Abbey'， Simon Keynes By 864, the area around Durnovaria was dominated by the Saxons who referred to themselves as Dorsaetas, 'People of the Dor' – Durnovaria. The original local name would have been Dorn-gweir giving the Old English Dornwary. The town became known as Dornwaraceaster or Dornwaracester, combining the original name Dor/Dorn from the Latin and Celtic languages with cester, an Old English word for a Roman station. This name evolved over time to Dorncester/Dornceaster and Dorchester. At the time of the Norman conquest, Dorchester was not a place of great significance; the Normans did build a castle but it has not survived. A priory was also founded, in 1364, though this also has since disappeared. In the later medieval period the town prospered; it became a thriving commercial and political centre for south Dorset, with a textile trading and manufacturing industry which continued until the 17th century.Taylor (1970) In the time of Edward III (1312–1377), the town was governed by bailiffs and burgesses, with the number of burgesses increasing to fifteen by the reign of James I (1566–1625). Judge Jeffreys' lodging house, now a restaurant, in High West Street =Early modern= :\\"The town is populous, tho' not large, the streets broad, but the buildings old, and low; however, there is good company and a good deal of it; and a man that coveted a retreat in this world might as agreeably spend his time, and as well in Dorchester, as in any town I know in England\\". – Daniel Defoe, in his A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain (1724–26).Chandler (1990; p. 72) In the 17th and 18th centuries Dorchester suffered several serious fires: in 1613, caused by a tallow chandler's cauldron getting too hot and setting alight; in 1622, started by a maltster; in 1725, begun in a brewhouse; and in 1775, caused by a soap boiler. The 1613 fire was the most devastating, resulting in the destruction of 300 houses and two churches (All Saints and Holy Trinity). Only a few of the town's early buildings have survived to the present day, including Judge Jeffreys' lodgings and a Tudor almshouse. Among the replacement Georgian buildings are many, such as the Shire Hall, which are built in Portland stone. The Town Hall was erected in 1791 and had a marketplace underneath. In the 17th century the town was at the centre of Puritan emigration to America, and the local rector, John White, organised the settlement of Dorchester, Massachusetts. The first colonisation attempted was at Cape Ann, where fishermen who would rejoin the fishing fleet when the vessels returned the next year, tried to be self-sufficient. However, the land was unsuitable, the colony failed and was moved to what is now Salem. In 1628, the enterprise received a Royal Charter and the Massachusetts Bay Company was formed with three hundred colonists arriving in America that year and more the following year. For his efforts on behalf of Puritan dissenters, White has been called the unheralded founder of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. (Some observers have attributed the oversight to the fact that White, unlike John Winthrop, never went to America.) In 1642, just before the English Civil War, Hugh Green, a Catholic chaplain was executed here. After his execution, Puritans played football with his head. The town was heavily defended against the Royalists in the civil war and Dorset was known as \\"the southern capital of coat-turning\\", as the county gentry found it expedient to change allegiance and to swap the sides they supported on several occasions. In 1643, the town was attacked by 2,000 troops under Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon. Its defences proved inadequate and it quickly surrendered but was spared the plunder and punishment it might otherwise have received. It remained under Royalist control for some time, but was eventually recaptured by the Puritans. In 1685 the Duke of Monmouth failed in his invasion attempt, the Monmouth Rebellion, and almost 300 of his men were condemned to death or transportation in the \\"Bloody Assizes\\" presided over by Judge Jeffreys in the Oak Room of the Antelope Hotel in Dorchester. =Modern= Shire Hall in High West Street, where the trial of the Tolpuddle martyrs took place In 1833, the Tolpuddle Martyrs founded the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers. Trade unions were legal but because the members swore an oath of allegiance, they were arrested and tried in the Shire Hall. Beneath the courtroom are cells where the prisoners were held while awaiting trial. Dorchester Prison was constructed in the town during the 19th century and was used for holding convicted and remanded inmates from the local courts until it closed in December 2013. Plans have since been made to erect 189 dwellings and a museum on the site. Dorchester remained a compact town within the boundaries of the old town walls until the latter part of the 19th century because all land immediately adjacent to the west, south and east was owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. The land composed the Manor of Fordington. The developments that had encroached onto it were Marabout Barracks, to the north of Bridport Road, in 1794, Dorchester Union Workhouse, to the north of Damer's Road, in 1835, the Southampton and Dorchester Railway and its station east of Weymouth Avenue, in 1847, the Great Western Railway and its station to the south of Damer's Road, in 1857, the waterworks, to the north of Bridport Road, in 1854, a cemetery, to the west of the new railway and east of Weymouth Avenue, in 1856, and a Dorset County Constabulary police station in 1860, west of the Southampton railway, east of Weymouth Avenue and north of Maumbury Rings. The Duchy land was farmed under the open field system until 1874 when it was enclosed – or consolidated – into three large farms by the landowners and residents.Morris and Draper (1995) The enclosures were followed by a series of key developments for the town: the enclosing of Poundbury hillfort for public enjoyment in 1876, the 'Fair Field' (new site for the market, off Weymouth Avenue) in 1877, the Recreation Ground (also off Weymouth Avenue) opening in 1880, and the Eldridge Pope Brewery of 1881, adjacent to the railway line to Southampton. Salisbury Field was retained for public use in 1892 and land was purchased in 1895 for the formal Borough Gardens, between West Walks and Cornwall Road. The clock and bandstand were added in 1898.Waymark (1997) A 1937 map of Dorchester A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of the Depot Barracks in 1881. The High West Street drill hall was created, by converting a private house, around the same time. Land was developed for housing outside the walls including the Cornwall Estate, between the Borough Gardens and the Great Western Railway from 1876 and the Prince of Wales Estate from 1880. Land for the Victoria Park Estate was bought in 1896 and building began in 1897, Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee year. The lime trees in Queen's Avenue were planted in February 1897. Poundbury is the western extension of the town, constructed since 1993 according to urban village principles on Duchy of Cornwall land owned by Prince Charles. Being developed over 25 years in four phases, it will eventually have 2,500 dwellings and a population of about 6,000. Prince Charles was involved with the development's design. Dorchester became Dorset's first Official Transition Initiative in 2008 as part of the Transition Towns concept. Transition Town Dorchester is a community response to the challenges and opportunities of peak oil and climate change. Government From 1295 to 1868, Dorchester was a parliamentary constituency. This was abolished by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, after which Dorchester was placed in the new Dorset South constituency and in 1918 it was transferred to Dorset West, where it has remained ever since. Dorchester is represented by two tiers of government. Dorchester Town Council and Dorset Council, both of which are based within the town. The Member of Parliament for West Dorset was Oliver Letwin from 1997 to 2019. Since the 2019 general election, the local MP has been Conservative Chris Loder. The town's coat of arms depicts the old castle that used to stand on the site of the former prison. The royal purple background represents Dorchester's status as part of the monarch's private estate, a position held since before the Domesday Book was published. The shield is divided into quarters, two depicting lions and two fleur-de-lis. These are copied from the shields of the troops from Dorset who took part in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The fleur-de-lis have a scattered arrangement which shows that permission for the armorial bearings was given before 1405, after which date the rights were varied by King Henry VI. The inscription 'Sigillum Bailivorum Dorcestre' translates as 'Seal of the Bailiffs of Dorchester'. The mayor has a similar seal of office, but this has the inscription Dorcestriensis Sig: Maioris. There are four electoral wards in Dorchester (North, South, East and West) showing a combined population of 19,060. The town has been growing steadily with 11,620 residents in 1951, 13,740 in 1971 and 15,100 in 1991. On 15 December 2004, Dorchester was the first town in Dorset to be granted Fairtrade status. In 2011, Dorchester was one of more than 20 towns across the country to apply for city status to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, although in March 2012 it was revealed that Dorchester's bid had been unsuccessful. The River Frome on the edge of the town Geography Dorchester town centre is sited about above sea-level on gently sloping ground beside the south bank of the River Frome.Ordnance Survey (1978), 1:25,000 Second Series, Sheet SY 69/79 (Dorchester) Measured directly, it is about north of Weymouth, SSE of Yeovil in Somerset, and west of Poole.John Bartholomew & Son Ltd (1980), 1:100,000 National Map Series, sheet 4 (Dorset), The town's built-up area extends south, west and southeast of the town centre; to the north and northeast growth is restricted by the floodplain and watermeadows of the river.Ordnance Survey (2010), 1:25,000 Explorer Map, sheet 117 (Cerne Abbas & Bere Regis); The land immediately south and west of the town is part of the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is traversed by the South Dorset Ridgeway, part of the South West Coast Path. There are over five hundred ancient monuments along the chalk hills that form the ridgeway, including barrows, stone circles and hillforts; many archaeological finds from the area are on view at the Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. The geology of the town comprises bedrock formed in the Coniacian, Santonian and Campanian ages of the Late Cretaceous epoch, overlain in places by more recent Quaternary drift deposits. The bedrock is chalk of various formations. The drift deposits comprise a cap of clay-with-flints on the western edge of the town around Poundbury, alluvium in the river's floodplain, and several narrow ribbons of poorly stratified head deposits, found particularly around the town's northeastern and southwestern boundaries but also elsewhere.British Geological Survey (2000), 1:50,000 Series, England and Wales Sheet 328 (Dorchester); Economy In 2012 there were 17,500 people working in Dorchester, 51% of whom were working full-time. 57% of jobs were in public administration, education and health, 18% were in professional and market services (including finance and ICT), 17% were in distribution, accommodation and food, 4% were in production and 2% in construction. The unemployment rate in July 2014 was 0.9% of residents aged 16–64. Dorchester has six industrial estates: The Grove Trading Estate (7.1 ha or 18 acres), Poundbury Trading Estate (5 ha or 12 acres), Marabout Barracks (2 ha or 4.9 acres), Great Western Centre (1.4 ha or 3.5 acres), Railway Triangle (1.4 ha or 3.5 acres) and Casterbridge Industrial Estate (1.1 ha or 2.7 acres). The estates mostly house light industrial units, wholesalers and the service sector. Significant employers for residents in the town include AEA Technology, BAeSEMA Ltd, Dorset County Council, Dorset County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Goulds Ltd, Henry Ling Ltd, Kingston Maurward College, Tesco, and Winterbourne Hospital. In 2008 the Dorchester BID, a business improvement district, was set up to promote the town and improve the trading environment for town centre businesses. Local traders were overwhelmingly in favour of the decision, with 84% voting in favour at the February 2008 ballot. The BID is funded by a levy on the businesses in the town. The BID lasts initially for five years, and between 2013 and 2018 the projects being undertaken include business support, security projects, town promotion, the provision of green spaces and making the town more visually attractive. In June 2018 the Dorchester BID was successful in being voted in for a second term. The catchment population for major food retail outlets in Dorchester is 38,500 (2001 estimate) and extends eight miles west, north and east of the town, and two miles south. The Brewery Square redevelopment project now includes retail outlets, residential units, bars, restaurants, hotel and cultural facilities. The regeneration of Dorchester South railway station will make it the UK's first solar powered railway station. The Charles Street development has had a first phase completed that includes a library and adult education centre for Dorset County Council, and offices for Dorset Council. Future phases are planned to include 23 shops, an underground car park, hotel and affordable housing. The second phase has attracted funding of £4 million from the former West Dorset District Council and includes new Marks & Spencer and Waitrose stores. Demography In the 2011 census Dorchester civil parish had 8,996 dwellings, 8,449 households and a population of 19,060, with 48.35% of residents being male and 51.65% being female. 17% of residents were under the age of 16 (compared to 18.9% for England as a whole), and 22.4% of residents were age 65 or older (compared to 16.4% for England as a whole). Culture =Writers= Statue of Thomas Hardy beside The Grove, north of High West Street Novelist and poet Thomas Hardy based the fictional town of Casterbridge on Dorchester, and his novel The Mayor of Casterbridge is set there. Hardy's childhood home is to the east of the town, and his town house, Max Gate, is owned by the National Trust and open to the public. Hardy is buried in Westminster Abbey, but his heart was removed and buried in Stinsford. William Barnes, the West Country dialect poet, was Rector of Winterborne Came, a hamlet near Dorchester, for 24 years until his death in 1886,Bingham (1987) and ran a school in the town. There is a statue of Hardy and one of Barnes in the town centre; Barnes outside St. Peter's Church, and Hardy's beside the Top o' Town crossroads. John Cowper Powys's novel Maiden Castle (1936) is set in Dorchester and Powys intended it to be \\"a Rival of the Mayor of Casterbridge.Unpublished Diary 25 January 1935, quoted in Morine Krissdottir, Descents of Memory: The Life of John Cowper Powys. New York: Overlook Duckworth, 2007, pg. 313. Powys had lived in Dorchester as a child, between May 1880 and Christmas 1885, when his father was a curate there.Krissdottir, pp. 29, 39–40. Then, after returning from America in June 1934, he had lived at 38 High East Street, Dorchester, from October 1934 until July 1935, when he moved to Wales.Krissdottir, pp. 303, 308, 323. The building is commemorated with a plaque erected by the Dorchester Heritage Committee, but giving the date of his residence as 1936. =Performing arts and museums= Dorset County Museum Dorchester Arts, based in a former school building, runs a seasonal programme of music, dance and theatre events, participatory arts projects for socially excluded groups and the biannual Dorchester Festival. Dorchester Arts is an Arts Council 'National Portfolio organisation'. Dorchester Arts has been resident at the Corn Exchange since 2015. Dorchester museums include the Roman Town House, the Dinosaur Museum, the Terracotta Warriors Museum, the Dorset Teddy Bear Museum, the Keep Military Museum, Dorset County Museum. and the Tutankhamun Exhibition. All of these museums took part in the \\"Museums at Night\\" event in May 2011 in which museums across the UK opened after hours. The Durnovaria Silver Band is based in Fordington Methodist Church Hall. Notable buildings Church of St Peter Within Dorchester parish there are 293 structures that are listed by Historic England for their historic or architectural interest, including five that are listed Grade I and sixteen that are Grade II*. The Grade I structures are the Church of St George on Fordington High Street, the Church of St Peter on High West Street, Max Gate on Syward Road, the Roman town house on Northernhay, and Shire Hall on High West Street. The Church of St George has a late-11th-century south door that has a Caen stone tympanum with a realistic carved representation of St George surrounded by soldiers, said to depict the miracle of his appearance at the Battle of Antioch. The south aisle and the north part of the porch date from the 12th century. The Church of St Peter mostly dates from 1420–21, with a 12th-century south doorway reset into it. There are many notable monuments, including two 14th-century effigies and a 14th-century tomb chest. Thomas Hardy contributed to the addition of the vestry and chancel in 1856-7. Max Gate was designed by Thomas Hardy in the Queen Anne style, and was his home until his death in 1928. It was built in 1885. The remains of the Roman house north of county hall date from the early 4th century, with later 4th-century enlargements. It has a hypocaust heating system and mosaic pavements. It is the only visible Roman town house in Britain. The current Shire Hall building was designed by Thomas Hardwick and built in Portland stone ashlar in 1797. It replaced a previous structure that had fallen into disrepair. A tablet commemorates the sentencing of the Tolpuddle Martyrs here in 1834. The building housed the Crown Court until 1955; Thomas Hardy was a magistrate here and his experience provided inspiration for his writing. The building has changed little since the 19th century, and in 2014 planning permission was granted to transform it into a heritage centre and tourist attraction, to open in 2017. Education and healthcare Dorchester Library and Learning Centre Dorchester has thirteen first schools, three middle schools:St Osmund's Church of England Middle School, St Mary's Church of England Middle School, Puddletown and Dorchester Middle School and an upper school; The Thomas Hardye School which was founded in 1569 and endowed by Thomas Hardye, a merchant in 1579. It was expanded and reopened in 1888. In 2011 had 2,283 pupils on the roll. The author Thomas Hardy, a distance relative, was a school governor here from 1909 until shortly before his death. The nineteen schools in the Dorchester area form the Dorchester Area Schools Partnership (DASP). There is also a private school, Sunninghill Prep School, Kingston Maurward College is a land-based studies college on the outskirts of the town. It offers full-time and part-time courses, apprenticeships and university-level courses in a wide range of subjects including agriculture, horticulture, conservation, construction, countryside and wildlife management. The town's hospital is Dorset County Hospital on Williams Avenue. It offers a twenty-four-hour accident and emergency treatment with services being provided by Dorset County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Sport and leisure Dorchester Town F.C., the town's football team currently play in the Southern League Premier Division. Harry Redknapp and former England players Graham Roberts and Martin Chivers represented 'The Magpies' in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The club is based on Weymouth Avenue in the south of the town after moving from its old ground also on Weymouth Avenue. The club moved to the purpose-built 5,000 capacity Avenue Stadium on Duchy of Cornwall land in the early 1990s. Dorchester RFC is an amateur rugby union team who currently play in the Dorset & Wilts South 1 League. Dorchester Cricket Club play in the Dorset Premier League, being last crowned champions in 2009. A leisure centre and swimming pool on Coburg Road replaced the Thomas Hardye School Leisure Centre in 2012, at a cost of more than £8 million. In May 2009, a skatepark was opened at the junction of Maumbury Road and Weymouth Avenue in Dorchester after 12 years of planning and construction. Transportation Dorchester South railway station The town has two railway stations. Dorchester South is on the South Western Main Line to Bournemouth, Southampton and London Waterloo is operated by South Western Railway; Dorchester West, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is on the Heart of Wessex Line, operated by Great Western Railway and connects with Yeovil, Bath, Bristol, Gloucester and London Paddington. As part of the regeneration at the Brewery Site in the town centre, Dorchester South railway station will become the first solar powered railway station in the UK. Mowlem completed a bypass road to the south and west of the town in 1988, diverting through traffic using the A35 and A37 roads away from the town centre.Draper (1992) Dorchester is approximately 43 miles (69 km) south east of junction 25 of the M5 motorway at Taunton. Media Dorchester is served by two local radio stations: Wessex FM, and BBC Radio Solent. Dorset County Hospital has its own station named 'Ridgeway Radio' which has been on the air for fifty years. Local television news coverage is by Spotlight and Points West. Dorchester's regular print media comprises the Dorset Echo. Many homes in Dorchester have access to fibre broadband services provided by private companies. The town is part of the second phase of Superfast Dorset, a project to increase fibre broadband availability within the county, which has been completed.

All-Stars are selected by fans for starting fielders, by managers for pitchers, and by managers and players for reserves. The game is usually played on the second or third Tuesday in July, and is meant to mark the symbolic halfway point of the MLB season (though not the mathematical halfway point, which, for most seasons, falls within the previous calendar week). Both leagues share an All-Star break, with no regular-season games scheduled from the day before through two days after the All-Star Game. Some additional events and festivities associated with the game take place each year close to and during this break in the regular season. No official MLB All-Star Games were held in 1945 and 2020 (and no official selection of players took place) due to World War II travel restrictions and the coronavirus pandemic, respectively. Two All-Star Games were held each season from 1959 to 1962. The most recent All-Star Game was held on July 9, 2019, at Progressive Field, home of the AL's Cleveland Indians.Baseball Almanac. Retrieved July 10, 2019 The 2021 All-Star Games is scheduled to be held in Atlanta. On July 3, 2020, it was announced that the 2020 Major League Baseball All-Star Game scheduled to be held in Los Angeles would not be played due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They will instead host in 2022. Venues The first All-Star Game was held on July 6, 1933, at Comiskey Park in Chicago as part of the 1933 World's Fair, and was initiated by Arch Ward, then sports editor for the Chicago Tribune. Initially intended to be a one-time event, its great success resulted in making the contest an annual one. MLB chooses the venue for the All-Star Game. The criteria for venue selection are subjective; generally, cities with new ballparks and those who have not hosted the Game in many years – or evertend to get selected. Over time, this has resulted in certain cities being selected to host more often than others. Cleveland Stadium and the original Yankee Stadium have each hosted four All-Star Games, the most of any venue, and New York City has hosted more Games than any other city, having done so nine times in five different stadiums. At the same time, the New York Mets did not host for 48 seasons (1965–2012), while the Los Angeles Dodgers have not hosted since 1980, but will do so again in 2022, after 42 years. The Tampa Bay Rays are currently the only club yet to host an All-Star Game. The venues traditionally alternated between the American and National Leagues every year, with an AL team hosting in an odd-numbered year and an NL club hosting in an even-numbered year. This tradition has been broken several times; the first time was in 1951, when the AL's Detroit Tigers hosted the game as part of the city's 250th birthday (corrected by the NL hosting the next two seasons). The second was when the two-game format from 1959 to 1962 resulted in the AL being one game ahead in turn. The NL hosted two straight games in 2006 and 2007 (Pittsburgh and San Francisco), and then hosted four straight games from 2015 to 2018 (in Cincinnati, San Diego, Miami, and Washington). It will do so once again in 2020-2021 (in Los Angeles and Atlanta, respectively). During the first two decades of the Game's history, there were two pairs of teams that shared ballparks. In Philadelphia, the AL's Athletics and NL's Phillies both played at Shibe Park, and in St. Louis, the AL's Browns and NL's Cardinals shared Sportsman's Park. This led to some shorter-than-usual gaps between All-Star Games played at the same venue; Sportsman's Park hosted the All-Star Game twice in eight years (the Cardinals hosted in 1940 and the Browns in 1948), while Shibe Park was the All-Star venue twice in nine years (the Athletics hosted in 1943 and the Phillies in 1952). The \\"home team\\" has traditionally been the league in which the host franchise plays its games, but the AL was designated the home team for the 2016 All Star Game, despite its being played in Petco Park, home of the NL's San Diego Padres. This was announced after the 2017 All Star Game was awarded to Miami, marking a third straight game hosted at an NL venue. This was done because, from 2003 to 2016, the league who won the All Star Game was given home field advantage in the World Series, and MLB did not want to allow the NL to have the last at-bat in an All Star Game for three straight years.Here's why the American League was the home team in San Diego All-Star Game MLB ended this practice in 2017, and the All-Star Game reverted to having the host team's league serve as the home team. All-Star Team rosters =Selection of managers and coaches= Since 1934, the managers of the game are the managers of the previous year's league pennant winners and World Series clubs. The coaching staff for each team is selected by its manager. This honor is given to the manager, not the team, so it is possible that the All-Star manager could no longer be with the team with which he won. This happened in 2003, when Dusty Baker managed the National League team despite having moved from the National League champion San Francisco Giants to the Chicago Cubs. This has also included situations where the person is no longer actively managing a team. For the first All-Star Game, intended as a one-time event, Connie Mack and John McGraw were regarded as baseball's venerable managers, and were asked to lead the American and National League teams, respectively. McGraw came out of retirement for that purpose. Dick Williams resigned after managing the Oakland Athletics to the 1973 World Series. In 1974, he became manager of the California Angels, whose uniform he wore for the game. Tony La Russa, who managed the World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals in 2011, and retired after the season, came back to manage the National League in 2012. In 1979, Bob Lemon managed the American League team after having been fired by New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. Lemon led the Yankees to the 1981 World Series but did not make it to the '82 All-Star Game as manager after again being fired by Steinbrenner, so Billy Martin, skipper of the 1981 AL runner-up Oakland Athletics, led the All-Star squad. There have been some exceptional cases where the usual rule was abandoned. After the 1964 season and the World Series, the managers, Johnny Keane of the St. Louis Cardinals and Yogi Berra of the New York Yankees, both left their teams and found new jobs in the other league – Keane was hired to manage the Yankees and Berra became a player-coach with the New York Mets. The Philadelphia Phillies and Cincinnati Reds had finished in a second-place tie in the NL; the Chicago White Sox had finished second in the AL. Cincinnati's manager, Fred Hutchinson, had died in the off-season, so Gene Mauch of the Phillies and Al López of the White Sox were chosen to be the managers for the 1965 All-Star Game. The rule will need abandoning again in 2020, as the manager of the 2019 American League champion Houston Astros, A.J. Hinch, was suspended for the 2020 season (and subsequently fired by the Astros) for his role in the Astros' scandal involving the usage of video to steal signs. Because of the season- ending 1994–95 MLBPA strike where the season was abandoned without official league champions, the 1995 game featured the \\"unofficial\\" league champions, the managers of the clubs leading their respective leagues' won-loss records, Buck Showalter of the New York Yankees and Felipe Alou of the Montreal Expos for the All-Star Game. =Selection of players= 1933 AL All-Stars – Jimmie Foxx, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Al Simmons 1937 AL All-Stars – Joe Cronin, Bill Dickey, Joe DiMaggio, Charlie Gehringer, Jimmie Foxx, and Hank Greenberg The All Star game roster size for each league was 18 in 1933, 20 in 1934, 25 in 1939, 30 in 1982, 32 in 2003, 33 in 2009, and 34 in 2010. Since 2018, there have been 34 players on each league's team roster. On April 29, 2010, MLB announced several rules changes for future All-Star games, effective with the 2010 edition. * Rosters were expanded by one extra position player, to a total of 34. * The designated hitter will be used in all games, even in National League ballparks. * Pitchers who start on the Sunday before the game break will be replaced on the roster, but will still be recognized as All-Stars. * Each manager may designate a position player who will be eligible for game re- entry if the last position player is injured or ejected. This is in addition to a rule that allows a player to re-enter to replace an injured or ejected catcher. The AL and NL All-Stars are selected through the following process: * Fan voting (eight N.L. players; nine A.L. players): Baseball fans vote on the starting position players for the All-Star Game, with ballots formerly distributed at Major League Baseball games before mid-season and, as of 2015, exclusively on the Internet. In games with the designated hitter, the American League DH is also selected in this manner (and the National League DH is selected by the manager). Fan voting has been recently criticized because most of the starting players can come from teams that have large fan bases or passionate fan bases such as the Kansas City Royals and the Chicago Cubs. * Player voting (16 players): Eight pitchers (five starters and three relievers) and one back-up player for each position are elected by the players, coaches, and managers. If the top vote-getter at a position has also been selected via fan voting, the second-place finisher in this category is selected. * Manager selection (nine N.L. players; eight A.L. players): The manager of each league's All-Star team in consultation with the other managers in his league and the Commissioner's Office will fill his team's roster up to 33 players. The NL manager will also select his team's designated hitter. At this point, it is ensured that every team is represented by at least one player. * Final vote (1 player): After the list of 33 players for each league is announced, fans vote (on the Internet) for one additional player, chosen from a list of 5 players that is compiled by the manager of each league's team and the Commissioner's Office. * Replacements: After the roster is selected, the All- Star manager and the Commissioner's Office will replace players who are injured, decline to participate, and pitchers who started on the Sunday before the game. All-Star uniforms Since the first game, American League players have worn their respective team uniforms rather than wearing uniforms made specifically for the game, while National League players waited until the second game to do this. In the first game, the National League All-Star Team wore gray uniforms with navy blue letters spelling \\"NATIONAL LEAGUE\\" across the front of the jersey with \\"NL\\" caps. During the games of the 1970s and 1980s, alternate jerseys were commonly worn by players from the Oakland Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox. When the late 1980s and early 1990s approached, fewer alternates were worn for the games. They were back in use for the 1992 game by White Sox pitcher Jack McDowell and infielder Robin Ventura, and for the final time in the 1997 game by Seattle Mariners outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. & by San Diego Padres 3rd baseman Ken Caminiti. Under current MLB rules, alternate jerseys are no longer allowed to be worn during the game, as players must wear either their team's white or gray uniforms, depending on which league is the home team. Game- specific uniforms are made every year, but are not worn for the game itself. Instead these uniforms are worn during batting practice and the Home Run Derby.2016 Chicago Cubs All-Stars All-Star caps Starting with the 2014 All-Star Game, players began to wear special All-Star Game caps. For the workout, batting practice and Home Run Derby contest, players started using one type of cap with colors corresponding the league. For the All-Star Game day, players started wearing a cap with the team's logo on front and the All- Star Game logo on the right side. =History of player selection methods= Bess and Margaret Truman submitting their ballots for the 1953 Major League Baseball All-Star Game rosters In 1933 and 1934, the fans selected the 18 starters for game and the managers chose the rest of the teams players. From 1935 through 1944 and in 1946, the manager of each All-Star squad selected the entire team; in 1945, no MLB All-Star Game was held and no All-Stars were officially named. In 1947, fans were given the opportunity to vote on the eight starting position players, but in 1957, fans of the Cincinnati Reds stuffed the ballot box (see below), and elected a Red to every position except first base. Commissioner Ford Frick stepped in and removed two Reds from the lineup. As a response to this unfairness, fan voting was discontinued; players, coaches, and managers were given the sole authority to elect starting position players, for the next dozen years. Between the lack of fan input and over-exposure due to the double All-Star games in 1959–1962, interest in the game was thought to be waning. As part of the rise of the MLB Promotion Corporation's attempts to modernize marketing of baseball, fan balloting for the starting eight was restored for the 1970 game. Sometime in the 1960s, the distinction between left-fielder, center-fielder, and right-fielder was dropped, and it was provided that the top 3 vote-getters in the outfield category would start regardless of position. Oft-heard remarks prior to this time included ones such as \\"If you had Clemente, you couldn't have Aaron\\", and so on. Rico Carty was the first player ever selected to an All-Star team as a write-in candidate by fans, in 1970, the first year that voting was given back to the fans. Steve Garvey was the second player ever selected to an All-Star team as a write-in candidate by fans, in 1974. He was later the Most Valuable Player of that game as well as the National League MVP for that year. Since 2002, the final roster selection has been made by the public via the All-Star Final Vote. Until 2003, reserves and pitchers were chosen by the manager. Player voting was re-introduced in 2003 after the managers were criticized for picking players from their own team over more deserving players from other teams. This was particularly evident in 2002, when National League manager Bob Brenly selected his own catcher, Damian Miller, over the more deserving Paul Lo Duca; while American League manager Joe Torre selected his own third baseman, Robin Ventura, over the Oakland Athletics' Gold Glove and Silver Slugger-winning third baseman Eric Chavez.http://a.espncdn.com/mlb/allstar02/s/2002/0630/1400776.html Before the 2009 game, Major League Baseball announced that an additional pitcher would be added to each roster, bringing the total for each league to 33 players. The following year, MLB announced that an extra position player would be added to each roster for the 2010 game and beyond, bringing the total to 34 for each league. One continuing controversy of the player selection process is the rule that each team has to have at least one representative on its league's All- Star roster. Supporters of the rule point out that this prevents the large- market teams from totally dominating the squad, and keeps fan and media interest in the game, as fans would not be interested in the game if their team did not have any players involved. Opponents of the rule contend that the purpose of the game is to spotlight Major League Baseball's best players, and that some players from stronger teams are left off the roster in favor of possibly less deserving players from weaker teams. Both these arguments were strengthened by the greater urgency of winning the game, due to the former rule that the winning league attains home field advantage in the World Series. A number of compromises were suggested in the sports/news media as measures to mitigate these selection issues, including limiting the number of representatives a particular team could have; or requiring only that a certain percentage of the 30 teams be represented; or expanding the size of the All- Star rosters. The only exception is if a team trades its lone All-Star before the game; in this case, its league's All-Star Game manager is not required to include another player from that team. =Stuffing the ballot box= In 1957, fans of the Cincinnati Reds stuffed the ballot box and elected 7 Reds players to start in the All-Star Game: Johnny Temple (2B), Roy McMillan (SS), Don Hoak (3B), Ed Bailey (C), Frank Robinson (LF), Gus Bell (CF), and Wally Post (RF), and the only non-Red elected to start for the National League was St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Stan Musial. While the Reds were a good offensive team, most baseball observers agreed that they did not deserve seven starters in the All-Star Game. An investigation ordered by Commissioner Ford Frick showed that over half of the ballots cast came from Cincinnati, as the Cincinnati Enquirer had printed up pre-marked ballots and distributed them with the Sunday newspaper to make it easy for Reds fans to vote often for their favorite stars. Commissioner Ford Frick appointed Willie Mays of the New York Giants and Hank Aaron of the Milwaukee Braves to substitute for Reds players Gus Bell and Wally Post, and took fan voting rights away in future games; Bell was kept as a reserve, while Post was injured and would have been unable to play in any event. Managers, players, and coaches picked the entire team until 1969, when the vote for starters again returned to the fans. To prevent a repeat of this incident, from 1970 until the start of internet voting, each team has been given the same number of ballots to hand out. In 1998, that number was roughly 400,000 ballots. The 1988 Game was surrounded by tacit accusations against Oakland A's fans of stuffing the ballot box in favor of catcher Terry Steinbach, whose qualifications as a starter were questioned by some sportswriters.\\"1998 Cubs vs. Giants One Game Playoff\\" . Sporting News. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. July 13, 1988. Page: D/1. Steinbach wound up being named the game's Most Valuable Player, hitting a home run and a sacrifice fly to get both RBIs in a 2–1 win. Since the dawn of the internet age, online voting has again led to ballot stuffing. In 1999, Chris Nandor, a Red Sox fan, utilized a simple computer program to vote for Nomar Garciaparra over 39,000 times. Upon discovery, MLB rejected the votes. In 2015, Kansas City Royals fans were accused of stuffing the ballot box when eight of their players (Salvador Pérez, Lorenzo Cain, Mike Moustakas, Alcides Escobar, Eric Hosmer, Kendrys Morales, Alex Gordon, and Omar Infante) were leading the ballots at their respective positions before the final tally was taken. Had this result stood, the only non-Royal in the American League's starting lineup would have been Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim player Mike Trout. This also would have been a record for the most players from one team starting in the All-Star game. However, after MLB cancelled 65 million votes deemed to be fraudulent, the final starting roster included only Salvador Pérez, Lorenzo Cain, Alcides Escobar, and Alex Gordon (Gordon would be replaced due to injury). The only other Royals to make the final lineup were Mike Moustakas, Kelvin Herrera and Wade Davis; Moustakas as the winner of the AL All-Star Final Vote while Herrera and Davis, both pitchers, were chosen through either Player Ballots or by Royals and AL Manager, Ned Yost. =Designated hitter= In 1989, a designated hitter was allowed in the All-Star Game for the first time. Between 1989 and 2010, the designated hitter rule was applied based on the league in which the host team plays; it was used for games played in American League ballparks in each such instance, both teams used a designated hitter while in National League ballparks, managers have scheduled the pitcher to hit, though pinch hitters have almost always been used in practice. This allows a deserving nonstarter to make a plate appearance. In 2010, Major League Baseball announced the designated hitter rule would apply for every All-Star Game; while the 2010 game was already to have the DH, the 2011 game was the first played in a National League park with a DH. All-Star Game MVP Award The All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award is presented annually to the most outstanding player of each season's All-Star Game. Presented each year beginning in 1962 (two games were held in 1962 and an award was presented for each game), the MVP award was originally called the Arch Ward Memorial Award, after the man who came up with the concept of the All-Star Game in 1933. In 1970, the name was changed to the Commissioner's Trophy (two NL players were presented the award in 1975); however, the name change was reversed in 1985, so that the World Series Trophy (first awarded in 1967) could be renamed the Commissioner's Trophy. In 2002, the trophy itself retained its eponym, while the award itself was dedicated as The Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award, in honor of former Boston Red Sox player Ted Williams, who had died earlier that year. Tie games, rain delays, and home- field advantage in World Series The first tie in an All-Star Game occurred on July 31, 1961 at Fenway Park in Boston when the game was called at 1–1 after nine innings due to rain; the only other rain-shortened game was in 1952, but the National League defeated the American League, 3–2 in five innings. The 2002 All-Star Game, held in Milwaukee, ended in controversy in the 11th inning when both teams ran out of substitute players available to pitch in relief. At that point, Commissioner Bud Selig (a Milwaukee native and former owner of the Brewers) declared that the game would end after 11 innings, and it ended in a 7–all tie. The crowd booed and threw beer bottles onto the field, and the media were highly critical of this unsatisfactory conclusion. To provide additional incentive for victory, Major League Baseball reached an agreement with the players union to award home-field advantage for the World Series to the champion of the league that won the All-Star Game, for 2003 and 2004. The agreement was extended for both 2005 and 2006, and it remained in place until 2016. Since 2017, home-field advantage has been awarded to the World Series team having the better regular season record. Previously, home-field advantage in the World Series alternated between the two leagues each year. The American League took advantage of the new rule in each of its first seven years: between 2003 and 2009, the American League won four Series and the National League won three. The National League champion benefited from this rule for the first time in 2010. Even with this rule in effect, there was no guarantee that a repeat of the 2002 situation would not occur; to avoid future ties due to lack of available players, managers have been instructed to (and have voluntarily) hold back a few select position players and pitchers. This has resulted in some fan dissatisfaction and controversy when these players are never actually used in the game, such as Tim Wakefield in the 2009 All-Star Game. Such a move has resulted in calls to allow limited re-entry of players who have been replaced during the game (in addition to catchers, which is already allowed), thereby giving the freedom to use all the players on the roster without leaving teams with the situation where no players are available, as was the case in 2002. Since 2010, each league's manager is allowed to designate one position player who can re-enter the game to replace an injured or ejected player at any position, in addition to the existing rule covering catchers. A tie game could also be deemed a \\"suspended game\\" in which case it would become a tie if no make-up date was scheduled, but it would be extremely difficult to find such a make-up date in any event as Major League Baseball would have to postpone one or more days of the regular season and/or schedule the make-up date on a travel day during the postseason, the latter which would be unfair to teams involved in the upcoming series. Since 2012, there have been off days for all teams on the Wednesday and Thursday after the All-Star Game, and if necessary, the game could be finished in the morning or afternoon on Wednesday/Thursday if the situation warranted it. Furthermore, various writers have stated that home-field advantage in the World Series should be decided based on the regular season records of the participants, not on an exhibition game such as the All-Star Game played several months earlier. Some writers especially questioned the integrity of this rule after the 2014 All-Star Game, when St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright suggested that he intentionally gave Derek Jeter some easy pitches to hit in the New York Yankees' shortstop's final All-Star appearance before he retired at the end of that season. Winning streaks, run totals, longest games 90 All-Star Games have been played (including two games per year from 1959–1962), with the AL leading 45–43–2. The All-Star Game has seen several \\"eras\\" in which one league tended to dominate. From 1933 to 1949, the American League won 12 of the first 16. The National League dominated from 1950 to 1987, going 33–8–1. This included a stretch from 1963 to 1982 when it won 19 of 20, including 11 in a row from 1972 to 1982. Since 1988, the American League has dominated, going 25–6–1, including a 13-game unbeaten streak (12–0–1) from 1997 to 2009. The AL has a 373–370 run advantage. The longest All-Star Game, in terms of innings, lasted 15 innings, which has occurred twice: 1967 and 2008; the latter of which was the longest game, with a total time of 4 hours and 50 minutes. All-Star Game scheduling Except for 1983, the All-Star Game has been scheduled on a Tuesday in July since 1963. In that year, in order to observe the 50-year anniversary of the first All-Star Game, the game was held on a Wednesday night, July 6, fifty years to the day of the first such event (July 6, 1933), at the same venue, Chicago's Comiskey Park. There have been two All-Star Games scheduled on Tuesday that were subsequently moved during the season. * In 1969, the game was rained out and moved to Wednesday afternoon, July 23 (making it the last afternoon game). * In 1981, it was moved to Sunday, August 9, because of the MLB players' strike. This was the only game to be played on a weekend, and the most recent game not held in the month of July. The game was played at night for the first time in 1942, at the Polo Grounds, located in New York City. Since 1970 every ASG has been played under the lights, though when held at venues near enough to the west coast, the game starts in daylight in the late afternoon. Twice, the MLB All-Star Game has been deferred because of travel restrictions. In 1945, severe wartime travel restrictions in effect led to the game scheduled to be played at Boston's Fenway Park being deferred to the next season. In 2020, severe pandemic restrictions for MLB teams, including prohibiting teams from playing outside their divisions, the game scheduled to be played at Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium was deferred to 2022. There were two All-Star Games played each season from 1959 through 1962. The second game was added to raise money for the MLB players' pension funds, as well as other causes. The experiment was later abandoned on the grounds that having two games watered down the appeal of the event. In 1981, the game was moved from July to August, after the middle portion of the 1981 season, including the scheduled All-Star break, had been erased by the MLB players' strike. The game (in Cleveland) was moved from its original July date to August 9. The season would resume in an apertura and clausura format, second- half regular-season play began the next afternoon with a game in Wrigley Field in Chicago. Other All-Star Game events Since 1985, the Home Run Derby, a contest among home run hitters, has been held on the day before the All-Star Game. The most recent Home Run Derby Champion is Pete Alonso of the New York Mets, who won in 2019 as a rookie. Since 1999, the All-Star Futures Game has been held during All-Star Week. The two teams, one consisting of young players from the United States and the other consisting of young players from all other nations, are usually chosen based on prospect status in the minor leagues. Since 2001, the All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game pits teams with a mixture of former stars from the host team's past, as well as celebrities from music, film, and television. This game is held during the day prior to the Home Run Derby. (However, it is tape-delayed and broadcast after the Derby.) Since 2002, the ESPY Awards ceremony has been conducted on the Wednesday in July following the game. Because none of the major North American professional leagues have games scheduled for that day the National Basketball Association, National Football League, and National Hockey League are not in- season, MLB does not have games that day, and likewise college sports are on summer vacation major sports figures are available to attend. The show used to air on the subsequent Sunday five days later, with the results announced on ESPN.com and thereafter across media outlets immediately after taping was complete. Since 2010, the ESPY Awards are shown live (the first time was 2003); this helps the network fill airtime that would go unfilled because of the lack of any major league or high-level college sporting events.

He was canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970, as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. He is variously numbered as 1st, 20th or 13th Earl of Arundel. Early life Born in the Strand, London, he was the only child of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk by his first wife Lady Mary Fitzalan, daughter of Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel. He was baptised at Whitehall Palace with the royal family in attendance, and was named after his godfather, King Philip II of Spain.Pollen, John Hungerford. \\"Ven. Philip Howard.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 4 Apr. 2013 Philip Howard was born during the upheaval of the Reformation. His home from the age of seven was a former Carthusian monastery. At the age of fourteen he was married to his stepsister, Anne Dacre. He graduated from St John's College, Cambridge in 1574 and was about eighteen when he attended Queen Elizabeth I's court.\\"St Philip Howard\\", Diocese of Arundel and Brighton His life had been a frivolous one, both at Cambridge and at Court where he was a favourite of the Queen. Philip Howard's father, the Duke of Norfolk, was arrested on 1 October 1569 for his intrigues against Queen Elizabeth. The Duke was attainted and executed in 1572, but Philip Howard succeeded to his mother's inheritance upon the death of his grandfather, becoming Earl of Arundel in 1580. He was present at a debate held in 1581 in the Tower of London, between Father Edmund Campion, a Jesuit, Father Ralph Sherwin and a group of Protestant theologians. He was so impressed by the Catholics that he experienced a spiritual conversion. He renounced his previous, frivolous life and was reconciled with his wife. Conversion and imprisonment Arundel and much of his family remained Catholic recusants during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. He himself was suspected of disloyalty and regarded by the discontented Roman Catholics as the centre of the plots against the Queen's government, even as a possible successor. His family also attempted to leave England without permission; while some might have been able to do this unobserved, Arundel was a second cousin (once removed) of the Queen. In 1583 he was suspected of complicity in the Throckmorton Plot and prepared to escape to Flanders but his plans were interrupted by a visit from Elizabeth at his house in London and her order that he confine himself there. In September 1584 he became a Roman Catholic, hiding his conversion and attempting next year once more to escape abroad. He was betrayed by a servant and arrested not long after his ship set sail from Littlehampton. Howard was committed to the Tower of London on 25 April 1585. He was charged before the Star Chamber with being a Roman Catholic, with quitting England without leave, sharing in Jesuit plots, and claiming the dukedom of Norfolk. He was sentenced to pay £10,000 and to be imprisoned during the queen's pleasure. In July 1586 his liberty was offered to him if he would carry the sword of state before the queen to church. In 1588 he was accused of praying, together with other Romanists, for the success of the Spanish Armada. He was tried for high treason on the 14th of April 1589, found guilty and condemned to death, but his sentence was not executed; Queen Elizabeth never signed the death warrant, but Howard was not told this. He was kept constantly in fear of execution, although comforted by the companionship of a dog, which served as a go-between by which Howard and other prisoners, most notably the priest Robert Southwell, could send messages to each other. Although these two men never met, Howard's dog helped them to deepen their friendship and exchange encouragement in each other's plight. Philip Howard loved his pet, who is remembered along with him in a statue at Arundel Cathedral. One day Howard scratched into a wall of his cell these words: (\\"the more affliction [we endure] for Christ in this world, the more glory [we shall obtain] with Christ in the next\\") (cf. Rom 8). Howard spent ten years in the Tower, until his death from dysentery. He petitioned the Queen as he lay dying to allow him to see his wife and his son, who had been born after his imprisonment. The Queen responded that \\"If he will but once attend the Protestant Service, he shall not only see his wife and children, but be restored to his honors and estates with every mark of my royal favor.\\" To this, Howard is said to have replied: \\"Tell Her Majesty if my religion be the cause for which I suffer, sorry I am that I have but one life to lose.\\" He remained in the Tower, never seeing his wife or daughter again, and died alone on Sunday 19 October 1595.Homily of Cardinal Basil Hume, OSB, Arundel Cathedral, 25 October, 1995 He was immediately acclaimed as a Catholic Martyr. Howard was buried without ceremony beneath the floor of the church of St Peter ad Vincula, inside the walls of the Tower. Twenty-nine years later, his widow and son obtained permission from King James I of England to move the body to the Fitzalan Chapel located on the western grounds of Arundel Castle. Some of his bones are also found within his shrine at Arundel Cathedral. Howard was attainted in 1589 for his mother's title, but his son Thomas eventually was restored in blood and succeeded as Earl of Arundel, and to the lesser titles of his grandfather. Shrine of St Philip Howard Legacy Saint Philip Howard is one of the patron saints of the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton.Pastoral message of Bishop Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, 21 October 1995 Arundel Cathedral, originally known as the Church of St. Philip Neri, was commissioned by the 15th Duke of Norfolk in 1868. It was created a cathedral in 1965 and its dedication was changed to Our Lady and St. Philip Howard in October 1970. His tomb was moved to the cathedral in 1971 and remains a site of pilgrimage. He was the author of a translation of An Epistle of Jesus Christ to the Faithful Soule by Johann Justus (1595, reprinted 1871) and of three manuscript treatises On the Excellence and Utility of Virtue.

It is attributed to Willard Van Orman Quine who motivated his holism through extending Pierre Duhem's problem of underdetermination in physical theory to all knowledge claims.W. V. O. Quine. 'Two Dogmas of Empiricism.' The Philosophical Review, 60 (1951), pp. 20–43. online textDuhem, Pierre. The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory. Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton University Press, 1954. Duhem's idea was, roughly, that no theory of any type can be tested in isolation but only when embedded in a background of other hypotheses, e.g. hypotheses about initial conditions. Quine thought that this background involved not only such hypotheses but also our whole web of belief, which, among other things, includes our mathematical and logical theories and our scientific theories. This last claim is sometimes known as the Duhem–Quine thesis.Curd, M. and Cover, J.A. (Eds.) (1998). Philosophy of Science, Section 3, The Duhem-Quine Thesis and Underdetermination, W.W. Norton & Company. A related claim made by Quine, though contested by some (see Adolf Grünbaum 1962),Grünbaum, A. 1962. \\"The falsifiability of theories: total or partial? A contemporary evaluation of the Duhem-Quine thesis\\", Synthese, vol. 14:17-34. is that one can always protect one's theory against refutation by attributing failure to some other part of our web of belief. In his own words, \\"Any statement can be held true come what may, if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system.\\"W. V. O. Quine. 'Two Dogmas of Empiricism.' The Philosophical Review, 60 (1951), pp. 20–43. online text Underdetermination in physical theory By 1845 astronomers found that the orbit of planet Uranus around the Sun departed from expectations. Not concluding that Newton's law of universal gravitation was flawed, however, astronomers John Couch Adams as well as Urbain Le Verrier independently predicted a new planet, eventually known as Neptune, and even calculated its weight and orbit through Newton's theory. And yet neither did this empirical success of Newton's theory verify Newton's theory. Le Verrier soon reported that Mercury's perihelion—the peak of its orbital ellipse nearest to the Sun—advanced each time Mercury completed an orbit, a phenomenon not predicted by Newton's theory, which astrophysicists were so confident in that they predicted a new planet, named Vulcan, which a number of astronomers subsequently claimed to have seen. In 1905, however, Einstein's special theory of relativity claimed that space and time are both relative, refuting the very framework of Newton's theory that claimed that space and time were both absolute. In 1915, Einstein's general theory of relativity newly explained gravitation while precisely predicting Mercury's orbit. In 1919, astrophysicist Arthur Eddington led an expedition to test Einstein's prediction of the Sun's mass reshaping spacetime in its vicinity. The Royal Society announced confirmation—accepted by physicists as the fall of Newton's theory. Yet few theoretical physicists believe general relativity is a fundamentally accurate description of gravitation, and instead seek a theory of quantum gravity.https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2019/09/09/63-solo- finding-gravity-within-quantum-mechanics/ http://cgpg.gravity.psu.edu/people/Ashtekar/articles/rovelli03.pdf Total vs. partial holism Some scholars, like Quine, argue that if a prediction that a theory makes comes out true, then the corresponding piece of evidence confirms the whole theory and even the whole framework within which that theory is embedded. Some have questioned this radical or total form of confirmational holism. If total holism were true, they argue, that would lead to absurd consequences like the confirmation of arbitrary conjunctions. For example, if the general theory of relativity is confirmed by the perihelion of Mercury then, according to total holism, the conjunction of the general theory of relativity with the claim that the moon is made of cheese also gets confirmed. More controversially, the two conjuncts are meant to be confirmed in equal measure. The critics of total holism do not deny that evidence may spread its support far and wide. Rather, they deny that it always spreads its support to the whole of any theory or theoretical framework that entails or probabilistically predicts the evidence. This view is known as partial holism. One early advocate of partial confirmational holism is Adolf Grünbaum (1962). Another is Ken Gemes (1993).Gemes, K. 1993. 'Hypothetico-Deductivism, Content, and the Natural Axiomatization of Theories', Philosophy of Science, vol. 60:477-487. online text The latter provides refinements to the hypothetico- deductive account of confirmation, arguing that a piece of evidence may be confirmationally relevant only to some content parts of a hypothesis. More recently, and in a similar vein, Ioannis Votsis (2014) argues for an objectivist account of confirmation, according to which, monstrous hypotheses, i.e. roughly hypotheses that are put together in an ad hoc or arbitrary way, have internal barriers that prevent the spread of confirmation between their parts. Thus even though the conjunction of the general theory of relativity with the claim that the moon is made of cheese gets confirmed by the perihelion of Mercury since the latter is entailed by the conjunction, the confirmation does not spread to the conjunct that the moon is made of cheese. In other words, it is not always the case that support spreads to all the parts of a hypotheses, and even when it does, it is not always the case that it spreads to the different parts in equal measure.

While earlier definitions of anhedonia emphasized the inability to experience pleasure, anhedonia is used by researchers to refer to reduced motivation, reduced anticipatory pleasure (wanting), reduced consummatory pleasure (liking), and deficits in reinforcement learning. In the DSM-5, anhedonia is a component of depressive disorders, substance-related disorders, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders, where it is defined by either a reduced ability to experience pleasure, or a diminished interest in engaging in pleasurable activities. While the ICD-10 does not explicitly mention anhedonia, the depressive symptom analogous to anhedonia as described in the DSM-V is a loss of interest or pleasure. Definition While anhedonia was originally defined in 1896 by Théodule-Armand Ribot as the reduced ability to experience pleasure, it has been used to refer to deficits in multiple facets of reward. Re-conceptualizations of anhedonia highlight the independence of \\"wanting\\" and \\"liking\\". \\"Wanting\\" is a component of anticipatory positive affect, mediating both the motivation (i.e. incentive salience) to engage with reward, as well as the positive emotions associated with anticipating a reward. \\"Liking\\", on the other hand, is associated with the pleasure derived from consuming a reward. The consciousness of reward-related processes has also been used to categorize reward in the context of anhedonia, as studies comparing implicit behavior versus explicit self-reports demonstrate a dissociation of the two. Learning has also been proposed as an independent facet of reward that may be impaired in conditions associated with anhedonia, but empirical evidence dissociating learning from either \\"liking\\" or \\"wanting\\" is lacking. Anhedonia has also been used to refer to \\"affective blunting\\", \\"restricted range of affect\\", \\"emotional numbing\\", and \\"flat affect\\", particularly in the context of post-traumatic stress disorders. In PTSD patients, scales measuring these symptoms correlate strongly with scales that measure more traditional aspects of anhedonia, supporting this association. Causes Studies in clinical populations, healthy populations, and animal models have implicated a number of neurobiological substrates in anhedonia. Regions implicated in anhedonia include the prefrontal cortex as a whole, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the striatum, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hypothalamus, and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Neuroimaging studies in humans have reported that deficits in consummatory aspects of reward are associated with abnormalities in the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, while deficits in anticipatory aspects of reward are related to abnormalities in hippocampal, dorsal ACC and prefrontal regions. These abnormalities are generally consistent with animal models, except for inconsistent findings with regard to the OFC. This inconsistency may be related to the difficulty in imaging the OFC due to its anatomical location, or the small number of studies performed on anhedonia; a number of studies have reported reduced activity in the OFC in schizophrenia and major depression, as well as a direct relationship between reduced activity and anhedonia. Researchers theorize that anhedonia may result from the breakdown in the brain's reward system, involving the neurotransmitter dopamine. Anhedonia can be characterised as \\"impaired ability to pursue, experience and/or learn about pleasure, which is often, but not always accessible to conscious awareness\\". The conditions of akinetic mutism and negative symptoms are closely related. In akinetic mutism, a stroke or other lesion to the anterior cingulate cortex causes reduction in movement (akinetic) and speech (mutism). Occurrence =Major depressive disorder= Anhedonia occurs in roughly 70% of people with a major depressive disorder. Anhedonia is a core symptom of major depressive disorder; therefore, individuals experiencing this symptom can be diagnosed with depression, even in the absence of low/depressed mood.American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5. Washington, D.C: American Psychiatric Association. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) describes a \\"lack of interest or pleasure\\", but these can be difficult to discern given that people tend to become less interested in things which do not give them pleasure. The DSM criterion of weight loss is probably related, and many individuals with this symptom describe a lack of enjoyment of food. They can portray any of the non-psychotic symptoms and signs of depression. =Schizophrenia= Anhedonia is of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Although five domains are usually used to classify negative symptoms, factor analysis of questionnaires yield two factors, with one including deficits in pleasure and motivation. People with schizophrenia retrospectively report experiencing fewer positive emotions than healthy individuals. However, \\"liking\\" or consummatory pleasure, is intact in schizophrenics, as they report experiencing the same degree of positive affect when presented with rewarding stimuli. Neuroimaging studies support this behavioral observation, as most studies report intact responses in the reward system (i.e. ventral striatum, VTA) to simple rewards. However, studies on monetary rewards sometimes report reduced responsiveness. More consistent reductions are observed with regard to emotional response during reward anticipation, which is reflected in a reduced responsiveness of both cortical and subcortical components of the reward system. Schizophrenia is associated with reduced positive prediction errors (a normal pattern of response to an unexpected reward), which a few studies have demonstrated to be correlated with negative symptoms. Schizophrenics demonstrate impairment in reinforcement learnings tasks only when the task requires explicit learning, or is sufficiently complex. Implicit reinforcement learning, on the other hand, is relatively intact. These deficits may be related to dysfunction in the ACC, OFC and dlPFC leading to abnormal representation of reward and goals. =Substance-related disorders= Anhedonia is common in people who are dependent upon a wide variety of drugs, including alcohol, opioids, and nicotine. Although anhedonia becomes less severe over time, it is a significant predictor of relapse. =Post-traumatic stress disorder= While PTSD is associated with reduced motivation, part of the anticipatory \\"wanting\\", it is also associated with elevated sensation seeking, and no deficits in physiological arousal, or self reported pleasure to positive stimuli. PTSD is also associated with blunted affect, which may be due to the high comorbidity with depression. =Parkinson's disease= Anhedonia occurs frequently in Parkinson's disease, with rates between 7%–45% being reported. Whether or not anhedonia is related to the high rates of depression in Parkinson's disease is unknown. Sexual anhedonia Sexual anhedonia in males is also known as 'ejaculatory anhedonia'. This condition means that the man will ejaculate with no accompanying sense of pleasure. The condition is most frequently found in males, but women can suffer from lack of pleasure when the body goes through the orgasm process as well. Sexual anhedonia may be caused by: * Hyperprolactinaemia * Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), also called inhibited sexual desire * Low levels of the hormone testosterone * Spinal cord injury * Multiple sclerosis * Use of SSRI antidepressants or having used SSRI antidepressants in the past. * Use (or previous use) of antidopaminergic neuroleptics (anti-psychotics) * Fatigue * Physical illness It is very uncommon that a neurological examination and blood tests can determine the cause of a specific case of sexual anhedonia. Patients may be prescribed sustained-release bupropion to aid in treatment, which has been shown to relieve sexual dysfunction even in patients without depression. Social anhedonia =Definition= Social anhedonia is defined as a disinterest in social contact and a lack of pleasure in social situations, and is characterized by social withdrawal. This characteristic typically manifests as an indifference to other people. In contrast to introversion, a nonpathological dimension of human personality, social anhedonia represents a deficit in the ability to experience pleasure. Additionally, social anhedonia differs from social anxiety in that social anhedonia is predominantly typified by diminished positive affect, while social anxiety is distinguished by both decreased positive affect and exaggerated negative affect. This trait is currently seen as a central characteristic to, as well as a predictor of, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, as it is seen as a potential evolution of most personality disorders, if the patient is above age 24, when prodromal schizophrenia may be excluded.DSM-5® Clinical Cases John W. Barnhill, M.D. =Signs and symptoms= * Decreased ability to experience interpersonal pleasure * Social withdrawal/isolation * Decreased capacity for social contact and interaction * Lack of close friends and intimate relationships, and decreased quality of those relationships * Poor social adjustment * Decreased positive affect * Flat affect * Depressed mood * State-related anxiety =Background and early clinical observation= The term anhedonia is derived from the Greek an-, \\"without\\" and hēdonē, \\"pleasure\\". Interest in the nature of pleasure and its absence dates back to ancient Greek philosophers such as Epicurus. The symptoms of anhedonia were introduced to the realm of psychopathology in 1809 by John Haslam, who characterized a patient suffering from schizophrenia as indifferent to \\"those objects and pursuits which formerly proved sources of delight and instruction\\". The concept was formally coined by Théodule-Armand Ribot and later used by psychiatrists Paul Eugen Bleuler and Emil Kraepelin to describe a core symptom of schizophrenia. In particular, Rado postulated that schizotypes, or individuals with the schizophrenic phenotype, have two key genetic deficits, one related to the ability to feel pleasure (anhedonia) and one related to proprioception. In 1962 Meehl furthered Rado's theory through the introduction of the concept of schizotaxia, a genetically-driven neural integrative defect thought to give rise to the personality type of schizotypy. Loren and Jean Chapman further distinguished between two types of anhedonia: physical anhedonia, or a deficit in the ability to experience physical pleasure, and social, or a deficit in the ability to experience interpersonal pleasure. Recent research suggests that social anhedonia may represent a prodrome of psychotic disorders. Master's Thesis. University of Maryland, College Park. College Park, MD. First-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia show elevated levels of social anhedonia, higher baseline scores of social anhedonia are associated with later development of schizophrenia. These findings provide support for the conjecture that it represents a genetic risk marker for schizophrenia- spectrum disorders. Additionally, elevated levels of social anhedonia in patients with schizophrenia have been linked to poorer social functioning. Socially anhedonic individuals perform worse on a number of neuropsychological tests than non-anhedonic participants, and show similar physiological abnormalities seen in patients with schizophrenia. =Comorbidity= Anhedonia is present in several forms of psychopathology.American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision. (2000). Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association. Depression Social anhedonia is observed in both depression and schizophrenia. However, social anhedonia is a state related to the depressive episode and the other is trait related to the personality construct associated with schizophrenia. These individuals both tend to score highly on self-report measures of social anhedonia. Blanchard, Horan, and Brown demonstrated that, although both the depression and the schizophrenia patient groups can look very similar in terms of social anhedonia cross- sectionally, over time as individuals with depression experience symptom remission, they show fewer signs of social anhedonia, while individuals with schizophrenia do not. Blanchard and colleagues (2011) found individuals with social anhedonia also had elevated rates of lifetime mood disorders including depression and dysthymia compared to controls. Social anxiety As mentioned above, social anxiety and social anhedonia differ in important ways. However, social anhedonia and social anxiety are also often comorbid. People with social anhedonia may display increased social anxiety and be at increased risk for social phobias and generalized anxiety disorder. It has yet to be determined what the exact relationship between social anhedonia and social anxiety is, and if one potentiates the other. Individuals with social anhedonia may display increased stress reactivity, meaning that they feel more overwhelmed or helpless in response to a stressful event compared to control subjects who experience the same type of stressor. This dysfunctional stress reactivity may correlate with hedonic capacity, providing a potential explanation for the increased anxiety symptoms experienced in people with social anhedonia. In an attempt to separate out social anhedonia from social anxiety, the Revised Social Anhedonia ScaleEckblad, M.L., Chapman, L.J., Chapman, J.P., & Mishlove, M. (1982). The Revised Social Anhedonia Scale . Unpublished test didn't include items that potentially targeted social anxiety. However, more research must be conducted on the underlying mechanisms through which social anhedonia overlaps and interacts with social anxiety. The efforts of the \\"social processes\\" RDoC initiative will be crucial in differentiating between these components of social behavior that may underlie mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. =Primary relevance in schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders= Social anhedonia is a core characteristic of schizotypy, which is defined as a continuum of personality traits that can range from normal to disordered and contributes to risk for psychosis and schizophrenia. Social anhedonia is a dimension of both negative and positive schizotypy. It involves social and interpersonal deficits, but is also associated with cognitive slippage and disorganized speech, both of which fall into the category of positive schizotypy. Not all people with schizophrenia display social anhedonia and likewise, people who have social anhedonia may never be diagnosed with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder if they do not have the positive and cognitive symptoms that are most frequently associated with most schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Social anhedonia may be a valid predictor of future schizophrenia-spectrum disorders; young adults with social anhedonia perform in a similar direction to schizophrenia patients in tests of cognition and social behavior, showing potential predictive validity. Social anhedonia usually manifests in adolescence, possibly because of a combination of the occurrence of critical neuronal development and synaptic pruning of brain regions important for social behavior and environmental changes, when adolescents are in the process of becoming individuals and gaining more independence. =Treatment= There is no validated treatment for social anhedonia. Future research should focus on genetic and environmental risk factors to home in on specific brain regions and neurotransmitters that may be implicated in social anhedonia's cause and could be targeted with medication or behavioral treatments. Social support may also play a valuable role in the treatment of social anhedonia. Blanchard et al. found that a greater number of social supports, as well as a greater perceived social support network, were related to fewer schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms and to better general functioning within the social anhedonia group. So far, no medicine has been developed to specifically target anhedonia. =Gender differences= In the general population, males score higher than females on measures of social anhedonia. This sex difference is stable throughout time (from adolescence into adulthood) and is also seen in people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. These results may reflect a more broad pattern of interpersonal and social deficits seen in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. On average, males with schizophrenia are diagnosed at a younger age, have more severe symptoms, worse treatment prognosis, and a decrease in overall quality of life compared to females with the disorder. These results, coupled with the sex difference seen in social anhedonia, outline the necessity for research on genetic and hormonal characteristics that differ between males and females, and that may increase risk or resilience for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. =Assessing social anhedonia= There are several self-report psychometric measures of schizotypy which each contain subscales related to social anhedonia: * Revised Social Anhedonia Scale—Chapman Psychosis Proneness Scales * No Close Friends Subscale—Schizotypyal Personality Questionnaire * Introverted Anhedonia Subscale—Oxford–Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences =Genetic components= L.J. and J.P. Chapman were the first to discuss the possibility that social anhedonia may stem from a genetic vulnerability. The Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene has been consistently associated with risk for, and cause of, schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and other mental illnesses. More recently, DISC1 has been associated with social anhedonia within the general population. Tomppo identified a specific DISC1 allele that is associated with an increase in characteristics of social anhedonia. They also identified a DISC1 allele associated with decreased characteristics of social anhedonia, that was found to be preferentially expressed in women. More research needs to be conducted, but social anhedonia may be an important intermediate phenotype (endophenotype) between genes associated with risk for schizophrenia and phenotype of the disorder. =Neurobiological correlates= Researchers studying the neurobiology of social anhedonia posit that this trait may be linked to dysfunction of reward-related systems in the brain. This circuitry is critical for the sensation of pleasure, the computation of reward benefits and costs, determination of the effort required to obtain a pleasant stimulus, deciding to obtain that stimulus, and increasing motivation to obtain the stimulus. In particular, the ventral striatum and areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsolateral (dl) PFC, are critically involved in the experience of pleasure and the hedonic perception of rewards. With regards to neurotransmitter systems, opioid, gamma-Aminobutyric acid and endocannabinoid systems in the nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and OFC mediate the hedonic perception of rewards. Activity in the PFC and ventral striatum have been found to be decreased in anhedonic individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia. However, schizophrenia may be less associated with decreased hedonic capacity and more with deficient reward appraisal. Specific musical anhedonia Recent studies have found people who do not have any issue processing musical tones or beat, yet receive no pleasure from listening to music. Specific musical anhedonia is distinct from melophobia, the fear of music.

According to instrumentalists, a successful scientific theory reveals nothing known either true or false about nature's unobservable objects, properties or processes.*Anjan Chakravartty, , §4 \\"Antirealism: Foils for scientific realism: §4.1: \\"Empiricism\\", in Edward N. Zalta, ed, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Summer 2013 edn: \\"Traditionally, instrumentalists maintain that terms for unobservables, by themselves, have no meaning; construed literally, statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity. The most influential advocates of instrumentalism were the logical empiricists (or logical positivists), including Carnap and Hempel, famously associated with the Vienna Circle group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors elsewhere. In order to rationalize the ubiquitous use of terms which might otherwise be taken to refer to unobservables in scientific discourse, they adopted a non- literal semantics according to which these terms acquire meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example, 'electron' might mean 'white streak in a cloud chamber'), or with demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called 'operationalism'). Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately (in large measure) to the demise of logical empiricism and the growth of realism. The contrast here is not merely in semantics and epistemology: a number of logical empiricists also held the neo-Kantian view that ontological questions 'external' to the frameworks for knowledge represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is made solely on pragmatic grounds), thereby rejecting the metaphysical dimension of realism (as in Carnap 1950)\\". *Samir Okasha, Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 62: \\"Strictly we should distinguish two sorts of anti-realism. According to the first sort, talk of unobservable entities is not to be understood literally at all. So when a scientist pus forward a theory about electrons, for example, we should not take him to be asserting the existence of entities called 'electrons'. Rather, his talk of electrons is metaphorical. This form of anti-realism was popular in the first half of the 20th century, but few people advocate it today. It was motivated largely by a doctrine in the philosophy of language, according to which it is not possible to make meaningful assertions about things that cannot in principle be observed, a doctrine that few contemporary philosophers accept. The second sort of anti- realism accepts that talk of unobservable entities should be taken at face value: if a theory says that electrons are negatively charged, it is true if electrons do exist and are negatively charged, but false otherwise. But we will never know which, says the anti-realist. So the correct attitude towards the claims that scientists make about unobservable reality is one of total agnosticism. They are either true or false, but we are incapable of finding out which. Most modern anti-realism is of this second sort\\". Scientific theory is merely a tool whereby humans predict observations in a particular domain of nature by formulating laws, which state or summarize regularities, while theories themselves do not reveal supposedly hidden aspects of nature that somehow explain these laws. Instrumentalism is a perspective originally introduced by Pierre Duhem in 1906.Roberto Torretti, The Philosophy of Physics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 242–43: \\"Like Whewell and Mach, Duhem was a practicing scientist who devoted an important part of his adult life to the history and philosophy of physics. ... His philosophy is contained in La théorie physique: son objet, sa structure [The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory] (1906), which may well be, to this day, the best overall book on the subject. Its main theses, although quite novel when first put forward, have in the meantime become commonplace, so I shall review them summarily without detailed argument, just to associate them with his name. But first I ought to say that neither in the first nor in the second (1914) edition of his book did Duhem take into account—or even so much as mention—the deep changes that were then taking place in physics. Still, the subsequent success and current entrenchment of Duhem's ideas are due above all to their remarkable agreement with—and the light they throw on—the practice of mathematical physics in the twentieth century. In the first part of La théorie physique, Duhem contrasts two opinions concerning the aim of physical theory. For some authors, it ought to furnish 'the explanation of a set of experimentally established laws', while for others it is 'an abstract system whose aim is to summarize and logically classify a set of experimental laws, without pretending to explain these laws' (Duhem 1914, p. 3). Duhem resolutely sides with the latter. His rejection of the former rests on his understanding of 'explanation' ('explication' in French), which he expresses as follows: 'To explain, explicare, is to divest reality from the appearances which enfold it like veils, in order to see the reality face to face' (pp 3–4). Authors in the first group expect from physics the true vision of things-in-themselves that religious myth and philosophical speculation have hitherto been unable to supply. Their explanation makes no sense unless (i) there is, 'beneath the sense appearances revealed to us by our perceptions, [...] a reality different from these appearances' and (ii) we know 'the nature of the elements which constitute' that reality (p 7). Thus, physical theory cannot explain—in the stated sense—the laws established by experiment unless it depends on metaphysics and thus remains subject to the interminable disputes of metaphysicians. Worse still, the teachings of no metaphysical school are sufficiently detailed and precise to account for all of the elements of physical theory (p 18). Duhem instead assigns to physical theories a more modest but autonomous and readily attainable aim: 'A physical theory is not an explanation. It is a system of mathematical propositions, derived from a small number of principles, whose purpose is to represent a set of experimental laws as simply, as completely, and as exactly as possible (Duhem 1914, p. 24)\\". Rejecting scientific realism's ambitions to uncover metaphysical truth about nature, instrumentalism is usually categorized as an antirealism, although its mere lack of commitment to scientific theory's realism can be termed nonrealism. Instrumentalism merely bypasses debate concerning whether, for example, a particle spoken about in particle physics is a discrete entity enjoying individual existence, or is an excitation mode of a region of a field, or is something else altogether.P Kyle Stanford, Exceeding Our Grasp: Science, History, and the Problem of Unconceived Alternatives (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 198.Roberto Torretti, The Philosophy of Physics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 396–97, including quote: \\"First, quantum field theories have been the working theories at the frontline of physics for over 30 years. Second, these theories appear to do away with the familiar conception of physical systems as aggregates of substantive individual particles. This conception was already undermined by Bose–Einstein and Fermi–Dirac statistics (§6.1.4), according to which the so- called particles cannot be assigned a definite trajectory in ordinary space. But quantum field theories go a long step further and—or so it would seem—conceive 'particles' as excitation modes of the field. This, I presume, motivated Howard Stein's saying that 'the quantum theory of fields is the contemporary locus of metaphysical research' (1970, p. 285). Finally, the very fact that physicists conspicuously and fruitfully resort to unperspicacious theories can teach us something about the aim and reach of science. Here is how physicists work, dirty-handed, in their everyday practice, a far cry from what is taught at the Sunday school of the 'scientific worldview' \\".Meinard Kuhlmann, \\"Physicists debate whether the world is made of particles or fields—or something else entirely, Scientific American, 2013 Aug;309(2). Instrumentalism holds that theoretical terms need only be useful to predict the phenomena, the observed outcomes. There are multiple versions of instrumentalism. Instrumentalism is a variety of scientific anti-realism. History =British empiricism= Newton's theory of motion, whereby any object instantly interacts with all other objects across the universe, motivated the founder of British empiricism, John Locke, to speculate that matter is capable of thought.Torretti 1999 p. 75. The next leading British empiricist, George Berkeley, argued that an object's putative primary qualities as recognized by scientists, such as shape, extension, and impenetrability, are inconceivable without the putative secondary qualities of color, hardness, warmth, and so on. He also posed the question how or why an object could be properly conceived to exist independently of any perception of it.Torretti 1999 p. 101–02. Berkeley did not object to everyday talk about the reality of objects, but instead took issue with philosophers' talk, who spoke as if they knew something beyond sensory impressions that ordinary folk did not.Torretti 1999 p. 102. For Berkeley, a scientific theory does not state causes or explanations, but simply identifies perceived types of objects and traces their typical regularities. Berkeley thus anticipated the basis of what Auguste Comte in the 1830s called positivism, although Comtean positivism added other principles concerning the scope, method, and uses of science that Berkeley would have disavowed. Berkeley also noted the usefulness of a scientific theory having terms that merely serve to aid calculations without their having to refer to anything in particular, so long as they proved useful in practice. Berkeley thus predated the insight that logical positivists—who originated in the late 1920s, but who, by the 1950s, had softened into logical empiricists—would be compelled to accept: theoretical terms in science do not always translate into observational terms.Torretti 1999 p. 103. The last great British empiricist, David Hume, posed a number of challenges to Francis Bacon's inductivism, which had been the prevailing, or at least the professed view concerning the attainment of scientific knowledge. Regarding himself as having placed his own theory of knowledge on par with Newton's theory of motion, Hume supposed that he had championed inductivism over scientific realism. Upon reading Hume's work, Immanuel Kant was \\"awakened from dogmatic slumber\\", and thus sought to neutralise any threat to science posed by Humean empiricism. Kant would develop the first stark philosophy of physics.Torretti 1999 p. 98: \\"I shall dwell at some length on Kant's conception of the sources and scope of Newton's conceptual frame, for it was the first full-blown philosophy of physics and remains to this day the most significant\\". =German idealism= To save Newton's law of universal gravitation, Immanuel Kant reasoned that the mind is the precondition of experience and so, as the bridge from the noumena, which are how the world's things exist in themselves, to the phenomena, which are humans' recognized experiences. And so mind itself contains the structure that determines space, time, and substance, how mind's own categorization of noumena renders space Euclidean, time constant, and objects' motions exhibiting the very determinism predicted by Newtonian physics. Kant apparently presumed that the human mind, rather than a phenomenon itself that had evolved, had been predetermined and set forth upon the formation of humankind. In any event, the mind also was the veil of appearance that scientific methods could never lift. And yet the mind could ponder itself and discover such truths, although not on a theoretical level, but only by means of ethics. Kant's metaphysics, then, transcendental idealism, secured science from doubt—in that it was a case of \\"synthetic a priori\\" knowledge (\\"universal, necessary and informative\\")—and yet discarded hope of scientific realism. Meanwhile, it was a watershed for idealist metaphysics, and launched German idealism, most influentially Hegel's absolute idealism or objective idealism, or at least interpretations, often misinterpretations, and political misuses, of it. =Logical empiricism= Since the mind has virtually no power to know anything beyond direct sensory experience, Ernst Mach's early version of logical positivism (empirio- criticism) verged on idealism. It was alleged to even be a surreptitious solipsism, whereby all that exists is one's own mind. Mach's positivism also strongly asserted the ultimate unity of the empirical sciences. Mach's positivism asserted phenomenalism as to new basis of scientific theory, all scientific terms to refer to either actual or potential sensations, thus eliminating hypotheses while permitting such seemingly disparate scientific theories as physical and psychological to share terms and forms. Phenomenalism was insuperably difficult to implement, yet heavily influenced a new generation of philosophers of science, who emerged in the 1920s while terming themselves logical positivists while pursuing a program termed verificationism. Logical positivists aimed not to instruct or restrict scientists, but to enlighten and structure philosophical discourse to render scientific philosophy that would verify philosophical statements as well as scientific theories, and align all human knowledge into a scientific worldview, freeing humankind from so many of its problems due to confused or unclear language. The verificationists expected a strict gap between theory versus observation, mirrored by a theory's theoretical terms versus observable terms. Believing a theory's posited unobservables to always correspond to observations, the verificationists viewed a scientific theory's theoretical terms, such as electron, as metaphorical or elliptical at observations, such as white streak in cloud chamber. They believed that scientific terms lacked meanings unto themselves, but acquired meanings from the logical structure that was the entire theory that in turn matched patterns of experience. So by translating theoretical terms into observational terms and then decoding the theory's mathematical/logical structure, one could check whether the statement indeed matched patterns of experience, and thereby verify the scientific theory false or true. Such verification would be possible, as never before in science, since translation of theoretical terms into observational terms would make the scientific theory purely empirical, none metaphysical. Yet the logical positivists ran into insuperable difficulties. Moritz Schlick debated with Otto Neurath over foundationalism—the traditional view traced to Descartes as founder of modern Western philosophy—whereupon only nonfoundationalism was found tenable. Science, then, could not find a secure foundation of indubitable truth. And since science aims to reveal not private but public truths, verificationists switched from phenomenalism to physicalism, whereby scientific theory refers to objects observable in space and at least in principle already recognizable by physicists. Finding strict empiricism untenable, verificationism underwent \\"liberalization of empiricism\\". Rudolf Carnap even suggested that empiricism's basis was pragmatic. Recognizing that verification—proving a theory false or true—was unattainable, they discarded that demand and focused on confirmation theory. Carnap sought simply to quantify a universal law's degree of confirmation—its probable truth—but, despite his great mathematical and logical skill, discovered equations never operable to yield over zero degree of confirmation. Carl Hempel found the paradox of confirmation. By the 1950s, the verificationists had established philosophy of science as subdiscipline within academia's philosophy departments. By 1962, verificationists had asked and endeavored to answer seemingly all the great questions about scientific theory. Their discoveries showed that the idealized scientific worldview was naively mistaken. By then the leader of the legendary venture, Hempel raised the white flag that signaled verificationism's demise. Suddenly striking Western society, then, was Kuhn's landmark thesis, introduced by none other than Carnap, verificationism's greatest firebrand. Instrumentalism exhibited by scientists often does not even discern unobservable from observable entities. =Historical turn= From the 1930s until Thomas Kuhn's 1962 The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, there were roughly two prevailing views about the nature of science. The popular view was scientific realism, which usually involved a belief that science was progressively unveiling a truer view, and building a better understanding, of nature. The professional approach was logical empiricism, wherein a scientific theory was held to be a logical structure whose terms all ultimately refer to some form of observation, while an objective process neutrally arbiters theory choice, compelling scientists to decide which scientific theory was superior. Physicists knew better, but, busy developing the Standard Model, were so steeped in developing quantum field theory, that their talk, largely metaphorical, perhaps even metaphysical, was unintelligible to the public, while the steep mathematics warded off philosophers of physics. By the 1980s, physicists regarded not particles, but fields as the more fundamental, and no longer even hoped to discover what entities and processes might be truly fundamental to nature, perhaps not even the field. Kuhn had not claimed to have developed a novel thesis, but instead hoped to synthesize more usefully recent developments in the philosophy of science. In 1906, Duhem had introduced the problem of the underdetermination of theory by data, since any dataset could be consistent with several different explanations, how the success of any prediction does not, by affirming the consequent, a deductive fallacy, logically confirm the truth of the theory in question. In the 1930s, Ludwik Fleck had explained the role of perspectivism (logology) in science whereby scientists are trained in thought collectives to adopt particular thought styles setting expectations for a proper scientific question, scientific experiment, and scientific data. Scientists manipulate experimental conditions to obtain results that cohere with their own expectations—what the scientists presuppose is realistic—and as a result might be tempted to invoke the experimenter's regress in order to reject unexpected results. They would then redo these experiments under what were supposedly better and more conducive conditions. By the 1960s, physicists recognized two, differing roles of physical theory, formalism and interpretation. Formalism involved mathematical equations and axioms that, upon input of physical data, yielded certain predictions. Interpretation sought to explain why they succeeded. Widely read, Kuhn's 1962 thesis seemed to shatter logical empiricism, whose paradigmatic science was physics and which championed instrumentalism. Yet scientific realists, who were far more tenacious, responded by attacking Kuhn's thesis, perennially depicted thereafter as either illuminated or infamous. Kuhn later indicated that his thesis had been so widely misunderstood that he himself was not a Kuhnian. With logical empiricism's demise, Karl Popper's falsificationism was in the ascendancy, and Popper was knighted in 1965. Yet in 1961, the molecular biology research program had made its first major empirical breakthrough in cracking the genetic code. By the 1970s, molecular genetics' research tools could also be used for genetic engineering. In 1975, philosopher of science Hilary Putnam famously resurrected scientific realism with his no miracles argument, whereby the best scientific theories' predictive successes would appear miraculous if those theories were not at least approximately true about reality as it exists in and of itself beyond human perception. Antirealist arguments were formulated in response. = Karl Popper's scientific realism = By rejecting all variants of positivism via its focus on sensations rather than realism, Karl Popper asserted his commitment to scientific realism, merely via the necessary uncertainty of his own falsificationism. Popper alleged that instrumentalism reduces basic science to what is merely applied science.Karl R Popper, Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge (London: Routledge, 2003 [1963]), , quote: \\"Instrumentalism can be formulated as the thesis that scientific theories—the theories of the so-called 'pure' sciences—are nothing but computational rules (or inference rules); of the same character, fundamentally, as the computation rules of the so-called 'applied' sciences. (One might even formulate it as the thesis that \\"pure\\" science is a misnomer, and that all science is 'applied'.) Now my reply to instrumentalism consists in showing that there are profound differences between \\"pure\\" theories and technological computation rules, and that instrumentalism can give a perfect description of these rules but is quite unable to account for the difference between them and the theories\\". In his book \\"The fabric of reality\\", the British physicist David Deutsch followed Popper's critique of instrumentalism and argued that a scientific theory stripped of its explanatory content would be of strictly limited utility. =Constructive empiricism as a form of instrumentalism= Bas van Fraassen's (1980)van Fraassen, Bas C., 1980, The Scientific Image, Oxford: Oxford University Press. project of constructive empiricism focuses on belief in the domain of the observable, so for this reason it is described as a form of instrumentalism. In the philosophy of mind In the philosophy of mind, Instrumentalism is the view that propositional attitudes like beliefs are not actually concepts on which we can base scientific investigations of mind and brain, but that acting as if other beings have beliefs is a successful strategy.  Relation to pragmatism  Instrumentalism is closely related to pragmatism, the position that practical consequences is an essential basis for determining meaning, truth or value.

Within philosophy of science, this view is often an answer to the question \\"how is the success of science to be explained?\\" The discussion on the success of science in this context centers primarily on the status of unobservable entities apparently talked about by scientific theories. Generally, those who are scientific realists assert that one can make valid claims about unobservables (viz., that they have the same ontological status) as observables, as opposed to instrumentalism. Main features Scientific realism involves two basic positions. First, it is a set of claims about the features of an ideal scientific theory; an ideal theory is the sort of theory science aims to produce. Second, it is the commitment that science will eventually produce theories very much like an ideal theory and that science has done pretty well thus far in some domains. It is important to note that one might be a scientific realist regarding some sciences while not being a realist regarding others. According to scientific realism, an ideal scientific theory has the following features: *The claims the theory makes are either true or false, depending on whether the entities talked about by the theory exist and are correctly described by the theory. This is the semantic commitment of scientific realism. *The entities described by the scientific theory exist objectively and mind-independently. This is the metaphysical commitment of scientific realism. *There are reasons to believe some significant portion of what the theory says. This is the epistemological commitment. Combining the first and the second claim entails that an ideal scientific theory says definite things about genuinely existing entities. The third claim says that we have reasons to believe that many scientific claims about these entities are true, but not all. Scientific realism usually holds that science makes progress, i.e. scientific theories usually get successively better, or, rather, answer more and more questions. For this reason, many people, scientific realists or otherwise, hold that realism should make sense of the progress of science in terms of theories being successively more like the ideal theory that scientific realists describe. =Characteristic claims= The following claims are typical of those held by scientific realists. Due to the wide disagreements over the nature of science's success and the role of realism in its success, a scientific realist would agree with some but not all of the following positions. *The best scientific theories are at least partially true. *The best theories do not employ central terms that are non referring expressions. *To say that a theory is approximately true is sufficient explanation of the degree of its predictive success. *The approximate truth of a theory is the only explanation of its predictive success. *Even if a theory employs expressions that do not have a reference, a scientific theory may be approximately true. *Scientific theories are in a historical process of progress towards a true account of the physical world. *Scientific theories make genuine, existential claims. *Theoretical claims of scientific theories should be read literally and are definitively either true or false. *The degree of the predictive success of a theory is evidence of the referential success of its central terms. *The goal of science is an account of the physical world that is literally true. Science has been successful because this is the goal that it has been making progress towards. History Scientific realism is related to much older philosophical positions including rationalism and metaphysical realism. However, it is a thesis about science developed in the twentieth century. Portraying scientific realism in terms of its ancient, medieval, and early modern cousins is at best misleading. Scientific realism is developed largely as a reaction to logical positivism. Logical positivism was the first philosophy of science in the twentieth century and the forerunner of scientific realism, holding that a sharp distinction can be drawn between theoretical terms and observational terms, the latter capable of semantic analysis in observational and logical terms. Logical positivism encountered difficulties with: *The verificationist theory of meaning—see Hempel (1950). *Troubles with the analytic-synthetic distinction—see Quine (1950). *The theory-ladenness of observation—see Hanson (1958) Kuhn (1970) and Quine (1960). *Difficulties moving from the observationality of terms to observationality of sentences—see Putnam (1962). *The vagueness of the observational-theoretical distinction—see G. Maxwell (1962). These difficulties for logical positivism suggest, but do not entail, scientific realism, and led to the development of realism as a philosophy of science. Realism became the dominant philosophy of science after positivism.Garrett, B., Empirical Nursing: The Art of Evidence-Based Care (Bingley: Emerald Publishing, 2018), p. 70. Bas van Fraassen in his book The Scientific Image (1980) developed constructive empiricism as an alternative to realism. He argues against scientific realism that scientific theories do not aim for truth about unobservable entities. Responses to van Fraassen have sharpened realist positions and led to some revisions of scientific realism. Arguments for and against scientific realism = No miracles argument = One of the main arguments for scientific realism centers on the notion that scientific knowledge is progressive in nature, and that it is able to predict phenomena successfully.Cappelen, H., Gendler, T. S., & Hawthorne, J., eds., The Oxford Handbook of Philosophical Methodology (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 401–402. Many scientific realists (e.g., Ernan McMullin, Richard Boyd) think the operational success of a theory lends credence to the idea that its more unobservable aspects exist, because they were how the theory reasoned its predictions. For example, a scientific realist would argue that science must derive some ontological support for atoms from the outstanding phenomenological success of all the theories using them. Arguments for scientific realism often appeal to abductive reasoning or \\"inference to the best explanation\\" (Lipton, 2004). For instance, one argument commonly used—the \\"miracle argument\\" or \\"no miracles argument\\"—starts out by observing that scientific theories are highly successful in predicting and explaining a variety of phenomena, often with great accuracy. Thus, it is argued that the best explanation—the only explanation that renders the success of science to not be what Hilary Putnam calls \\"a miracle\\"—is the view that our scientific theories (or at least the best ones) provide true descriptions of the world, or approximately so. Bas van Fraassen replies with an evolutionary analogy: \\"I claim that the success of current scientific theories is no miracle. It is not even surprising to the scientific (Darwinist) mind. For any scientific theory is born into a life of fierce competition, a jungle red in tooth and claw. Only the successful theories survive—the ones which in fact latched on to actual regularities in nature.\\" (The Scientific Image, 1980) Some have argued that the no miracles argument commits the base rate fallacy.Collin Howson, Hume's Problem: Induction and the Justification of Belief (2000), Chap. 3 : Realism and the No Miracles Argument = Pessimistic induction = Pessimistic induction, one of the main arguments against realism, argues that the history of science contains many theories once regarded as empirically successful but which are now believed to be false. Additionally, the history of science contains many empirically successful theories whose unobservable terms are not believed to genuinely refer. For example, the effluvium theory of static electricity (a theory of the 16th Century physicist William Gilbert) is an empirically successful theory whose central unobservable terms have been replaced by later theories. Realists reply that replacement of particular realist theories with better ones is to be expected due to the progressive nature of scientific knowledge, and when such replacements occur only superfluous unobservables are dropped. For example, Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity showed that the concept of the luminiferous ether could be dropped because it had contributed nothing to the success of the theories of mechanics and electromagnetism. On the other hand, when theory replacement occurs, a well-supported concept, such as the concept of atoms, is not dropped but is incorporated into the new theory in some form. These replies can lead scientific realists to structural realism. = Constructivist epistemology = Social constructivists might argue that scientific realism is unable to account for the rapid change that occurs in scientific knowledge during periods of scientific revolution. Constructivists may also argue that the success of theories is only a part of the construction. However, these arguments ignore the fact that many scientists are not realists. During the development of quantum mechanics in the 1920s, the dominant philosophy of science was logical positivism. The alternative realist Bohm interpretation and many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics do not make such a revolutionary break with the concepts of classical physics. = Underdetermination problem = Another argument against scientific realism, deriving from the underdetermination problem, is not so historically motivated as these others. It claims that observational data can in principle be explained by multiple theories that are mutually incompatible. Realists might counter by saying that there have been few actual cases of underdetermination in the history of science. Usually the requirement of explaining the data is so exacting that scientists are lucky to find even one theory that fulfills it. Furthermore, if we take the underdetermination argument seriously, it implies that we can know about only what we have directly observed. For example, we could not theorize that dinosaurs once lived based on the fossil evidence because other theories (e.g., that the fossils are clever hoaxes) can account for the same data. = Incompatible models argument = According to the incompatible models argument, in certain cases the existence of diverse models for a single phenomenon can be taken as evidence of anti-realism.Frigg, Roman and Hartmann, Stephan, Models in Science, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2020 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). One example is due to Margaret Morrison, who worked to show that the shell model and the liquid-drop model give contradictory descriptions of the atomic nucleus, even though both models are predictive.Morrison, Margaret (2011). One phenomenon, many models: Inconsistency and complementarity. Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A 42 (2):342-351.

The most common \\"surgical steels\\" are austenitic SAE 316 stainless and martensitic SAE 440, SAE 420, and 17-4 stainless steels. Martensitic and austenitic are only described as 400 and 300 series. There is no formal definition on what constitutes a \\"surgical stainless steel\\", so product manufacturers and distributors often apply the term to refer to any grade of corrosion resistant steel. Medical grade stainless SAE 316 and SAE 316L stainless steel, also referred to as marine grade stainless, is a chromium, nickel, molybdenum alloy of steel that exhibits relatively good strength and corrosion resistance. 316L is the low carbon version of 316 stainless steel. 316L in particular is biocompatible when produced to ASTM F138 / F139. It is a common choice for biomedical implants, as well as body piercings and body modification implants. Immune system reaction to nickel is a potential complication of stainless steel usage within the human body. There are nickel-free nitrogen-strengthened austenitic stainless steel alloys available which address this concern. 316 surgical steel is also used in the manufacture and handling of food and pharmaceutical products where it is often required in order to minimize metallic contamination. 316L is an excellent material for use in jewelry due to its low risk for allergic reaction, as well as its ability to tolerate water. The corrosion resistance properties of all stainless steels is greatly enhanced by the passivation process. ASTM A967 details this process. Cutlery grade stainless SAE 440 and SAE 420 stainless steels, known also by the name \\"Cutlery Stainless Steel\\", are high carbon steels alloyed with chromium. They have very good corrosion resistance compared to other cutlery steels, but their corrosion resistance is inferior to 316 stainless. Surgical cutting instruments are often made from 440 or 420 stainless due to its high hardness coupled with acceptable corrosion resistance. This type of stainless steel may be slightly magnetic. General surgical tools are made from other chromium-bearing stainless steels, such as 17-4. ASTM F899 contains a list of commonly used metals for surgical instruments.

The location of Vostok Station in Antarctica The lowest natural temperature ever directly recorded at ground level on Earth is at the Soviet Vostok Station in Antarctica on 21 July 1983 by ground measurements. On 10 August 2010, satellite observations showed a surface temperature of at , along a ridge between Dome Argus and Dome Fuji, at elevation. The result was reported at the 46th annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco in December 2013; it is a provisional figure, and may be subject to revision. The value is not listed as the record lowest temperature as it was measured by remote sensing from satellite and not by ground-based thermometers, unlike the 1983 record. The temperature announced reflects that of the ice surface, while the Vostok readings measured the air above the ice, and so the two are not directly comparable. More recent work shows many locations in the high Antarctic where surface temperatures drop to approximately . Due to the very strong temperature gradient near the surface, these imply near-surface air temperature minima of approximately . Historical progression On 21 January 1838 a recording was made by the Russian merchant Neverov in Yakutsk, of . On 15 January 1885 H. Wild reported that a temperature of was noted in Verkhoyansk. A later measurement at the same place in February 1892 was reported as . Soviet researchers later announced a recording of in February 1933 at Oymyakon, about to the south-east of Verkhoyansk; this measurement was reported by Soviet texts through the 1940s as a record low, with the previous measurement from Verkhoyansk retroactively adjusted to . The next reliable measurement was made during the 1957 season at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica, yielding on 11 May and on 17 September. A subsequent measurement of , on 24 August 1960, held the record until a temperature of was measured at the Soviet Vostok Station, on the Antarctic Plateau, on 21 July 1983. This remains the record for a directly recorded temperature. Laboratory cooling =Early experiments= In 1904 Dutch scientist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes created a special lab in Leiden with the aim of producing liquid helium. In 1908 he managed to lower the temperature to less than −269 °C (−452.2 F, 4 K), which is less than four degrees above absolute zero. Only in this exceptionally cold state will helium liquefy, the boiling point of helium being at −268.94 °C (−452.092 F). Kamerlingh Onnes received a Nobel Prize for his achievement. Onnes' method relied upon depressurising the subject gases, causing them to cool by adiabatic cooling. This follows from the first law of thermodynamics; \\\\Delta U = \\\\Delta Q - \\\\Delta W where U = internal energy, Q = heat added to the system, W = work done by the system. Consider a gas in a box of set volume. If the pressure in the box is higher than atmospheric pressure, then upon opening the box our gas will do work on the surrounding atmosphere to expand. As this expansion is adiabatic and the gas has done work \\\\Delta Q = 0 \\\\Delta W > 0 \\\\Rightarrow \\\\Delta U < 0 Now as the internal energy has decreased, so has the temperature. =Modern experiments= As of November 2000, nuclear spin temperatures below 100 pK were reported for an experiment at the Helsinki University of Technology Low Temperature Lab. However, this was the temperature of one particular type of motion—a quantum property called nuclear spin—not the overall average thermodynamic temperature for all possible degrees of freedom.The experimental methods and results are presented in detail in Tauno A. Knuuttila’s D.Sc. thesis which can be accessed from Aaltodoc. The university’s press release on its achievement is here At such low temperatures, the concept of \\"temperature\\" becomes multifaceted since molecular motion cannot be assumed to average out across degrees of freedom. The corresponding peak emission will be in radio waves, rather than in the familiar infrared, so it is very inefficiently absorbed by neighboring atoms, making it difficult to reach thermal equilibrium. Low Temperature Laboratory recorded a record low temperature of 100 pK, or 1.0 × 10−10 K in 1999. The current apparatus for achieving low temperatures has two stages. The first utilizes a helium dilution refrigerator to get to temperatures of millikelvins, then the next stage uses adiabatic nuclear demagnetisation to reach picokelvins. Extremely low temperatures are useful for observation of quantum mechanical phases of matter such as superfluids and Bose–Einstein condensates, which would be disrupted by thermal motion.

This distribution might be used to represent the distribution of the maximum level of a river in a particular year if there was a list of maximum values for the past ten years. It is useful in predicting the chance that an extreme earthquake, flood or other natural disaster will occur. The potential applicability of the Gumbel distribution to represent the distribution of maxima relates to extreme value theory, which indicates that it is likely to be useful if the distribution of the underlying sample data is of the normal or exponential type. This article uses the Gumbel distribution to model the distribution of the maximum value. To model the minimum value, use the negative of the original values. The Gumbel distribution is a particular case of the generalized extreme value distribution (also known as the Fisher-Tippett distribution). It is also known as the log-Weibull distribution and the double exponential distribution (a term that is alternatively sometimes used to refer to the Laplace distribution). It is related to the Gompertz distribution: when its density is first reflected about the origin and then restricted to the positive half line, a Gompertz function is obtained. In the latent variable formulation of the multinomial logit model — common in discrete choice theory — the errors of the latent variables follow a Gumbel distribution. This is useful because the difference of two Gumbel-distributed random variables has a logistic distribution. The Gumbel distribution is named after Emil Julius Gumbel (1891-1966), based on his original papers describing the distribution.Gumbel E.J. (1941). \\"The return period of flood flows\\". The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 12, 163–190. Definitions The cumulative distribution function of the Gumbel distribution is :F(x;\\\\mu,\\\\beta) = e^{-e^{-(x-\\\\mu)/\\\\beta}}.\\\\, =Standard Gumbel distribution= The standard Gumbel distribution is the case where \\\\mu = 0 and \\\\beta = 1 with cumulative distribution function :F(x) = e^{-e^{(-x)}}\\\\, and probability density function :f(x) = e^{-(x+e^{-x})}. In this case the mode is 0, the median is -\\\\ln(\\\\ln(2)) \\\\approx 0.3665, the mean is \\\\gamma\\\\approx 0.5772 (the Euler-Mascheroni constant), and the standard deviation is \\\\pi/\\\\sqrt{6} \\\\approx 1.2825.

Related distributions * If X has a Gumbel distribution, then the conditional distribution of Y=−X given that Y is positive, or equivalently given that X is negative, has a Gompertz distribution. The cdf G of Y is related to F, the cdf of X, by the formula G(y) = P(Y \\\\le y) = P(X \\\\ge -y  X \\\\le 0) = (F(0)-F(-y))/F(0) for y>0. Consequently, the densities are related by g(y) = f(-y)/F(0): the Gompertz density is proportional to a reflected Gumbel density, restricted to the positive half-line. * If X is an exponentially distributed variable with mean 1, then −log(X) has a standard Gumbel distribution. * If X \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{Gumbel}(\\\\alpha_X, \\\\beta) and Y \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{Gumbel}(\\\\alpha_Y, \\\\beta) then X-Y \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{Logistic}(\\\\alpha_X-\\\\alpha_Y,\\\\beta) \\\\, (see Logistic distribution). * If X and Y \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{Gumbel}(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) then X+Y sim \\\\mathrm{Logistic}(2 \\\\alpha,\\\\beta) \\\\,.

Theory related to the generalized multivariate log-gamma distribution provides a multivariate version of the Gumbel distribution. Occurrence and applications Distribution fitting with confidence band of a cumulative Gumbel distribution to maximum one-day October rainfalls.CumFreq, software for probability distribution fitting Gumbel has shown that the maximum value (or last order statistic) in a sample of a random variable following an exponential distribution minus natural logarithm of the sample size [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3527556/gumbel-distribution-and- exponential-distribution?noredirect=1#comment7669633_3527556 user49229, Gumbel distribution and exponential distribution ] approaches the Gumbel distribution closer with increasing sample size. In hydrology, therefore, the Gumbel distribution is used to analyze such variables as monthly and annual maximum values of daily rainfall and river discharge volumes, and also to describe droughts. Gumbel has also shown that the estimator for the probability of an event -- where r is the rank number of the observed value in the data series and n is the total number of observations -- is an unbiased estimator of the cumulative probability around the mode of the distribution. Therefore, this estimator is often used as a plotting position. In number theory, the Gumbel distribution approximates the number of terms in a random partition of an integer as well as the trend-adjusted sizes of maximal prime gaps and maximal gaps between prime constellations. Article 13.5.2. In machine learning, the Gumbel distribution is sometimes employed to generate samples from the categorical distribution. Computational methods =Probability paper= A piece of graph paper that incorporates the Gumbel distribution. In pre- software times probability paper was used to picture the Gumbel distribution (see illustration). The paper is based on linearization of the cumulative distribution function F : : -\\\\ln[-\\\\ln(F)] = (x-\\\\mu)/\\\\beta In the paper the horizontal axis is constructed at a double log scale. The vertical axis is linear. By plotting F on the horizontal axis of the paper and the x-variable on the vertical axis, the distribution is represented by a straight line with a slope 1/\\\\beta. When distribution fitting software like CumFreq became available, the task of plotting the distribution was made easier, as is demonstrated in the section below. =Generating Gumbel variates= Since the quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution function), Q(p), of a Gumbel distribution is given by :Q(p)=\\\\mu-\\\\beta\\\\ln(-\\\\ln(p)), the variate Q(U) has a Gumbel distribution with parameters \\\\mu and \\\\beta when the random variate U is drawn from the uniform distribution on the interval (0,1).

It stretches from Exmouth in East Devon to Studland Bay in Dorset, a distance of about , and was inscribed on the World Heritage List in mid-December 2001. The site spans 185 million years of geological history, coastal erosion having exposed an almost continuous sequence of rock formation covering the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. At different times, this area has been desert, shallow tropical sea and marsh, and the fossilised remains of the various creatures that lived here have been preserved in the rocks. Natural features seen on this stretch of coast include arches, pinnacles and stack rocks. In some places the sea has broken through resistant rocks to produce coves with restricted entrances and, in one place, the Isle of Portland is connected to the land by a barrier beach. In some parts of the coast, landslides are common. These have exposed a wide range of fossils, the different rock types each having its own typical fauna and flora, thus providing evidence of how animals and plants evolved in this region. The area around Lulworth Cove contains a fossil forest, and 71 different rock strata have been identified at Lyme Regis, each with its own species of ammonite. The fossil collector Mary Anning lived here and her major discoveries of marine reptiles and other fossils were made at a time when the study of palaeontology was just starting to develop. The Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre provides information on the heritage coast, and the whole length of the site can be visited via the South West Coast Path. World Heritage Site The Jurassic Coast stretches from Orcombe Point near Exmouth in East Devon to Old Harry Rocks near Swanage in East Dorset, a distance of . Inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2001, the Jurassic Coast was the first wholly natural World Heritage Site to be designated in the United Kingdom. At Orcombe Point, the \\"Geoneedle\\" (2002), an acute pyramidal sculpture, marks the western end of the heritage site; this is built out of fragments of the different types of rocks to be seen along the coast. The UNESCO World Heritage Committee nomination document lists eight segments of coast included in the site. The segments are: * from Orcombe Rocks to Chit Rocks, Sidmouth * from River Sid, Sidmouth to Seaton Hole * from River Axe, Axmouth to The Cobb, Lyme Regis * from Lyme Regis to West Bay * Chesil Beach, the Fleet Lagoon and the Isle of Portland Coast * Portland Harbour Shore * from Bowleaze Cove to Peveril Point * from New Swanage to Studland Bay The cliffs on this part of the coast are being eroded as sections crumble away and landslides occur. These processes reveal successive layers of sedimentary rock, uncovering the geological history at the modern coastline over a period of 185 million years, and disclosing an almost continuous sequence of rock formations covering the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossils found in the area and the coastal geomorphologic features of this dynamic coast, have advanced the study of earth sciences for more than two hundred years. The area covered by the designation comprises the land between the mean low water mark and the top of the cliffs or the back of the beach. The fossils found in abundance along this coastline provide evidence of how animals and plants evolved in this region. During the Triassic this area was a desert, while in the Jurassic it was part of a tropical sea, and in the Cretaceous it was covered by swamps. The fossilised remains of the animals and plants that lived in those periods are very well preserved, providing a wealth of information on their body shapes, the way they died and even the fossilised remains of their last meals. Fossil groups found here include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, echinoderms, fish, amphibians, reptiles and a few mammals. At Lulworth Cove there is a fossil forest of conifers, tree-ferns and cycads.  Geology  Lyme Bay Coastal rock in the Jurassic Coast Durdle Door The Jurassic limestones on the Isle of Portland have been extensively quarried. Gad Cliff to St Alban's Head The Jurassic Coast consists of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous cliffs, spanning the Mesozoic, documenting 185 million years of geological history. The site can be best viewed from the sea, when the dipping nature of the rock strata becomes apparent. In East Devon, the coastal cliffs consist of steep cliffs of red sandstone from the Triassic, and at Budleigh Salterton, the gravel cliffs contain red quartzite pebbles which accumulate on the beach below as Budleigh pebbles, locally protected.Budleigh Pebbles Further east at Ladram Bay, more sandstone cliffs give rise to spectacular red sandstone stacks. Around Lyme Regis and Charmouth the cliffs are of Jurassic clays and shale, and landslips are common. Chesil Beach is a good example of a barrier beach and stretches for from Burton Bradstock to the Isle of Portland. The beach encloses an intertidal lagoon which is an internationally important Ramsar Convention site known for its biodiversity. At Lulworth Cove, the waves have cut their way through the resistant Portland stone and created a horseshoe-shaped cove by eroding the softer sands and clays behind. Another feature of this part of the coast is Durdle Door, a natural arch. Sea stacks and pinnacles, such as Old Harry Rocks at Handfast Point, have been formed by erosion of the chalk cliffs. The highest point on the Jurassic Coast, and on the entire south coast of Britain, is Golden Cap at between Bridport and Charmouth. This coast shows excellent examples of landforms, including the natural arch at Durdle Door, the cove and limestone folding at Lulworth Cove and a tied island, the Isle of Portland. Chesil Beach is a fine example of both a tombolo (a deposition landform in which an island is attached to the mainland by a narrow piece of land such as a spit or bar) and a storm beach (a beach affected by particularly fierce waves). The site has stretches of both concordant and discordant coastlines. Due to the quality of the varied geology, the site is the subject of international field studies. The many sedimentary layers on this coastline are rich with fossils, the remains of the animals and plants present in the area whose tissues became immersed in deposits of mud which later hardened into rock. At Lyme Regis, for example, geologists have identified 71 layers of rock, each one containing fossils of a different species of ammonite.  History  At the end of the 18th century Georges Cuvier showed that some fossil animals resembled no living ones, thus demonstrating that animals could become extinct; this led to the emergence of palaeontology, the study of fossils. The coasts of eastern Devon and western Dorset were rich in fossil beds, but before this time the fossils had merely been gathered as a pastime or collected by local residents and sold to visitors as curios. Mary Anning (1799–1847) lived in Lyme Regis and followed in her father's footsteps as a collector. She became an expert on the fossils to be found in the Blue Lias around the town and discovered the first complete Ichthyosaur skeleton at The Spittles. Other important discoveries of ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and a pterosaur followed, as well as invertebrates such as cephalopods and their ink sacs. During World War II several sections of the Jurassic Coast became the property of the Ministry of War. One of the Royal Navy's largest bases was at Portland Harbour, though it has since closed. A major army base at Bovington remains in use today. Large areas of land, including the coast between Lulworth Cove and Kimmeridge, are still only partially accessible; this includes the ghost village of Tyneham which was evacuated after being requisitioned by the army in 1943. Areas of the coast near Exmouth, The Fleet Lagoon at Weymouth and the beaches at Studland have also been used for military training but have since been returned to civilian use. Parts of the coast, especially around Portland, can be dangerous, and shipwrecks have been a feature of the coast. In January 2007 the coast experienced its most environmentally damaging wreck when the MSC Napoli, a 2,400 capacity container ship, was beached at Branscombe near Sidmouth, losing oil and cargo.BBC News, 2007. Stricken cargo ship run aground. Management and access The Jurassic Coast is subject to severe weather conditions at times. Violent storms occurred in 1824 and 1974, and these and various lesser storms have battered the cliffs and caused flooding and structural damage in coastal towns. The coast is largely an eroding landscape and management of the site aims to allow the natural processes of erosion to continue while protecting people and property. Coastal defences have been put in place in Charmouth and Weymouth, where houses are at risk, but in other places, where the coastline remains in a natural state, the management policy is to take no action and allow erosion to take its course. The Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre is an independent educational charity situated near the beach in Charmouth; it provides information and displays on the geology of the area and the wildlife, including a large collection of fossils and a rockpool aquarium. Family fossil-hunting trips are organised from here as well as other events and activities related to the geology and natural history of the area. The entire length of the coast can be walked on the South West Coast Path. Landslips and rockfalls are a continuing feature of the evolution of this coast. On 6 May 2008, a section of the coast was dramatically re-shaped after a landslip that was described as the worst in 100 years.BBC News, 2008. Landslip is 'worst in 100 years'. There was a fatality in 2012 when of rock fell onto the beach at Burton Bradstock and another cliff fall took place in 2016 at West Bay, near Bridport. There was a further cliff collapse at Hive Beach near the village of Burton Bradstock shortly before dawn on 29 August 2020 after prolonged rain fall. The public were warned to stay clear of the unstable rocks.

A politically charged song, it is a simplified version of imperialist history from the 1959 Cuban Revolution to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas of the 1980s, with mention of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Dalai Lama, and Víctor Jara, referencing his death at the hands of the Chilean military dictatorship in the stadium that now bears his name. Although a criticism of the foreign policy of the United States, the song's final stanza also delivers a criticism of Communist states by making reference to the treatment of pacifist Buddhist monks in the People's Republic of China during the Cultural Revolution and the Soviet Union's Invasion of Afghanistan. The song's title is often thought to have been a pun on the name of the American capital city's National Basketball Association franchise, the Washington Bullets (which later went on to change its name to the Washington Wizards), but frontman Joe Strummer denied any knowledge of the basketball team previous to the song's release.Liner notes to The Clash on Broadway: The song is one of The Clash's more experimental, in the reggae style, with a marimba and lyrics that are almost spoken rather than sung. Though the marimba is the most prominent instrument, electric guitar riffs are still audible. The marimba part is an altered version of the melody from \\"Turkey in the Straw\\". On the tribute album The Clash Tribute: The Never Ending Story, the song was covered by Attila the Stockbroker, with new lyrics to the later verses, omitting the reference to Afghanistan and The Clash's subtle attack on communism. The new verses are critical of U.S. involvement in the end of the Soviet Union, and Boris Yeltsin's embrace of western-style capitalism, making particular disparaging references to the new world order following the end of the Cold War.

Once attached, the island is then known as a tied island. Several islands tied together by bars which rise above the water level are called a tombolo cluster.Glossary of Geology and Related Sciences. The American Geological Institute, 1957 Two or more tombolos may form an enclosure (called a lagoon) that can eventually fill with sediment. Formation The tombolo connecting St Ninian's Isle with the Shetland Mainland Monte Argentario, Tuscany, Italy Chesil Beach, seen from the Isle of Portland The Angel Road of Shōdo Island, Japan Mount Maunganui, New Zealand, to the city of Tauranga The eastern end of Bennett Island with its glaciated tombolo in the background Satellite view of Gwadar, Pakistan Sutton which connects Howth Head and County Dublin The shoreline moves toward the island (or detached breakwater) due to accretion of sand in the lee of the island where wave energy and longshore drift are reduced and therefore deposition of sand occurs. =Wave diffraction and refraction= True tombolos are formed by wave refraction and diffraction. As waves near an island, they are slowed by the shallow water surrounding it. These waves then bend around the island to the opposite side as they approach. The wave pattern created by this water movement causes a convergence of longshore drift on the opposite side of the island. The beach sediments that are moving by lateral transport on the lee side of the island will accumulate there, conforming to the shape of the wave pattern. In other words, the waves sweep sediment together from both sides. Eventually, when enough sediment has built up, the beach shoreline, known as a spit, will connect with an island and form a tombolo.Easterbrook, Don T. Surface Processes and Landforms, Second Edition. 1999 Prentice Hall Inc. = Unidirectional longshore drift = In the case of longshore drift due to an oblique wave direction, like at Chesil Beach or Spurn Head, the flow of material is along the coast in a movement which is not determined by wave diffraction around the now tied island, such as Portland, which it has reached. In this and similar cases like Cadiz, while the strip of beach material connected to the island may be technically called a tombolo because it links the island to the land, it is better thought of in terms of its formation as a spit, because the sand or shingle ridge is parallel rather than at right angles to the coast. Morphology and sediment distribution Tombolos demonstrate the sensitivity of shorelines. A small piece of land, such as an island, or a beached shipwreck can change the way that waves move, leading to different deposition of sediments. Sea level rise may also contribute to accretion, as material is pushed up with rising sea levels. Tombolos are more prone to natural fluctuations of profile and area as a result of tidal and weather events than a normal beach is. Because of this susceptibility to weathering, tombolos are sometimes made more sturdy through the construction of roads or parking lots. The sediments that make up a tombolo are coarser towards the bottom and finer towards the surface. It is easy to see this pattern when the waves are destructive and wash away finer grained material at the top, revealing coarser sands and cobbles as the base.

These are usually the initial letters of the words of the phrase abbreviated, and are written in capital letters (upper case); three-letter abbreviations such as etc. and Mrs. are not three-letter acronyms, but \\"TLA\\" is a TLA (an example of an autological abbreviation). Most three-letter abbreviations are not, strictly, acronyms, but rather initialisms: all the letters are pronounced as the names of letters, as in APA . Some are true acronyms, pronounced as a word; computed axial tomography, CAT, is almost always pronounced as the animal's name () in \\"CAT scan\\". Even the initialisms are however considered three-letter acronyms, because that term appeared first in widespread use, and is overwhelmingly popular today.

Three-letter acronyms were used as mnemonics in biological sciences, from 1977 and their practical advantage was promoted by Weber in 1982. They are used in many other fields, but the term TLA is particularly associated with computing. In 1980, the manual for the Sinclair ZX81 home computer used and explained TLA.Steven Vickers ZX81 Basic Programming, Sinclair Research Limited, page 161 \\"As you can see, everything has a three letter abbreviation (TLA).\\" The specific generation of three-letter acronyms in computing was mentioned in a JPL report of 1982.TDA Progress Report R.

In standard English, WWW is the TLA whose pronunciation requires the most syllables -- typically nine. The usefulness of TLAs typically comes from it being quicker to say the acronym than the phrase it represents; however saying 'WWW' in English requires three times as many syllables as the phrase it is meant to abbreviate (World Wide Web).

Biography Multilingual plate at his birthplace from the World Wildlife Fund, with text in Basque, French and English. Born in Espelette near Bayonne, in the north of Basque Country, in Pyrénées-Atlantiques département of France, he entered the Congregation of the Mission in 1848, having already displayed great fondness for the natural sciences. Ordained in 1851, he was shortly afterwards sent to Beijing, where he began a collection of material for a museum of natural history, mainly zoological, but in which botany, geology, and palaeontology were also well represented. At the request of the French government, important specimens from his collection were sent to Paris and aroused the greatest interest. The Jardin des Plantes commissioned him to undertake scientific journeys through China to make further collections. He succeeded in obtaining many specimens of hitherto unknown animals and plants, and the value of his comprehensive collections for the advance of systematic zoology and especially for the advancement of animal geography received universal recognition from the scientific wo at Paris in April, 1888. He had found in China all together 200 species of wild animals, of which 63 were hitherto unknown to zoologists, and 807 species of birds, 65 of which had not been described before. He made a large collection of reptiles, amphibians, and fishes and handed it over to specialists for further study. Père David's Rat Snake (Elaphe davidi) was named in his honor by Henri Émile Sauvage in 1884.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Père David\\", p. 203). Also, a large number of moths and insects, many of them hitherto unknown, were brought to the museum of the Jardin des Plantes. What Father David's scientific journeys meant for botany may be inferred from the fact that among the rhododendrons which he collected no less than fifty-two new species were found and among the primulae about forty, while the Western Mountains of China furnished an even greater number of hitherto unknown species of gentian. The most notable of the animals 'found' by David, which were hitherto unknown to Europeans, were the giant panda in Baoxing County and Père David's deer. The latter had disappeared with the exception of a few preserved in the gardens of the emperor of China, but David succeeded in securing a specimen and sent it to Europe. David also sent back the first emerald ash borer specimen. In the midst of his work as a naturalist Father David did not neglect his missionary labours, and was noted for his careful devotion to his religious duties and for his obedience to every detail of his order's rules.

Deported from the US In the 1970, Kouwenhoven was sentenced to two years in prison in the US after being caught in an FBI sting operation while attempting to sell 6 stolen artworks, including a Rembrandt. He served only 17 days and was deported from the US. Involvement in Liberia Kouwenhoven started his career in Liberia in the 1980s as the manager of Hotel Africasee eg. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/27/theobserver and later on headed the Oriental Timber Corporation (OTC), the main timber company in Liberia in the early 2000s, during the Liberian Civil War. The company was used as a cover for arms smuggling. The United Nations issued an order in 2001 banning him from traveling because of arms trafficking. Trials Kouwenhoven was arrested in the Netherlands on 18 March 2005 and stood trial at the Court of First Instance in The Hague, starting 24 April 2006, charged with arms smuggling and war crimes in Liberia in the 90s, for which the Dutch public prosecutors sought a 20-year jail sentence and a fine of €450,000. The court tried to summon Charles Taylor to testify against Kouwenhoven. On 7 June 2006 Kouwenhoven was sentenced to 8 years in jail for arms smuggling. The court did not find him guilty of war crimes. Both the public prosecutors and Kouwenhoven sought a higher court appeal and Kouwenhoven was released in March 2007 in anticipation of his new trial.. The Court of Appeal in The Hague acquitted him of all charges on 10 March 2008 and sharply criticized the work of the prosecution. The prosecution appealed the acquittal to the Supreme Court on 20 March 2008. In April 2010 the Supreme Court ordered a re-trial at the court in Den Bosch. In November 2014, the court in Den Bosch was to hear arguments for dismissal as there were no witnesses available to testify. The Prosecutor Cara Pronk-Jordan wished to have the earlier anonymous interviews used as evidence. Kouwenhof fled to South Africa in December 2016, claiming medical grounds.

He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1979 to 2008, representing Elmwood—Transcona and its antecedent ridings in the House of Commons of Canada for the federal New Democratic Party. Following his retirement from federal politics, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 2009 until 2011, representing the Winnipeg division of Elmwood as a member of the New Democratic Party of Manitoba, and served as Minister of Conservation and Government House Leader. Blaikie had the longest continuous parliamentary record in the 38th and 39th Canadian parliaments, and in this capacity served as the Dean of the House. He also holds the record as having the longest continuous parliamentary service of any CCF/NDP MP in Canadian History.: Bill Blaikie in classroom presentation University of Winnipeg 2015 He is a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and has the right to be styled the Honourable for life. Blaikie was the Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada from 2006 to 2008. Prior to the 2011 Manitoba election, he announced that he was retiring from political life. Early life and career Blaikie was born to a working-class family in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on June 19, 1951. His father was employed by Canadian National for over forty years, at first as a machinist and later in management. Blaikie served in The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada from 1967 to 1972, and was a labourer on and off with the Canadian National Railway from 1969 to 1974 while attending university. He was a member of the Young Progressive Conservatives in high school, and joined the NDP in 1971.Graham Fraser, \\"Stalwart makes a passionate pitch --- Blaikie says he's the strong leader needed to save medicare\\", Toronto Star, 9 November 2002, H4. Blaikie has a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy and religious studies from the University of Winnipeg (1973), and a Master of Divinity from Emmanuel College, Toronto School of Theology (1977). He was ordained as a minister in the United Church of Canada on June 4, 1978, and subsequently became a politician in the social gospel tradition of such figures as J.S. Woodsworth, Tommy Douglas and Stanley Knowles.Blaikie himself delivered the eulogy at Knowles's funeral in 1997. See \\"Knowles bid fond farewell\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 June 1997, A10. Blaikie explained the linkage between his political and religious views in 2000, writing \\"As a Christian on the left I would want to argue [...] that there is a vast realm called \\"the economy,\\" and all the values and practices that it explicitly and implicitly reinforces, that should be judged, in the Christian mind, by whether or not it conforms to the teachings of Jesus Christ, whether any false gods, like the market, are worshipped therein, whether the poor and the oppressed are given priority, and whether, environmentally speaking, creation is being looked after.\\" See Bill Blaikie, \\"Day's politics versus his faith --- Opposition leader argues from conservative, not biblical principles\\", Toronto Star, 2 December 2000, 1.

He held many important critic portfolios, and was respected by members of all parties for his personal integrity and conviction.Bruce Campion-Smith, \\"Veteran MP set to retire\\", Toronto Star, 16 March 2007, A6. =Clark, Trudeau and Turner governments (1979–84)= Blaikie was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1979 federal election, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative MP Dean Whiteway (who had previously been elected in the riding of Selkirk, which was eliminated by redistribution). The Progressive Conservatives won a minority government under the leadership of Joe Clark, but lost a parliamentary motion of non-confidence later in the year. A new election was held in early 1980, in which the Liberal Party won a majority government under the leadership of Pierre Trudeau. Blaikie was comfortably re-elected in his own riding. Blaikie was appointed as the NDP's Social Policy Critic in 1979,Mary Trueman, \\"Retired judge is appointed to review medicare system\\", Globe and Mail, 18 September 1979, P1. and was promoted to Health Critic in 1980.Ross Laver, \\"Restrict MDs' fees, scrap premiums, Ottawa told\\", Globe and Mail, 4 September 1980, P1.

When the Southam newspaper chain shut down the Winnipeg Tribune and left the city's newspaper market to the rival Free Press, he commented that Winnipeggers were now being forced to look at the world \\"through one eye rather than two\\", and recommended increased government oversight of the industry. See Ross Laver, \\"Papers should be licenced, inquiry told\\", Globe and Mail, 10 December 1980, P10. He expressed the same concern in 2000, when Thompson Corp. announced that it would sell off all of its holdings except The Globe and Mail. Blaikie called for limits on the number of newspapers that any chain could own. See Susanne Craig, \\"Thomson and Globe shift gears: Flagship publication will be centre of information powerhouse\\", Globe and Mail, 16 February 2000, A1. =Mulroney and Campbell governments (1984–93)= The Progressive Conservatives won a landslide majority government in the 1984 federal election under Brian Mulroney, defeating the Liberals under their new leader John Turner. Blaikie was again returned for his riding, and was appointed as NDP Environment Critic in the new parliament.\\"New Tory minister stands firm on cut to wildlife service\\", Globe and Mail, 20 November 1984, P5.

Blaikie later called for Canada to stop marketing its nuclear technology abroad, when the government of India conducted successful nuclear weapons tests in 1998. (Canada had inadvertently provided India with the technology used in its first nuclear test in 1974.) See Allan Thompson, \\"Ottawa bears responsibility, critics say\\", Toronto Star, 13 May 1998, A17. Blaikie spoke against a bill that proposed the return of capital punishment in 1987, saying that its passage would mark \\"a step toward not a less violent society, but a more violent society\\".Graham Fraser and Hugh Winsor, \\"Return of death penalty retrograde step, Hnatyshyn says\\", Globe and Mail, 26 June 1987, A12. The bill was defeated in a free vote. He was also an opponent of Sunday shopping law reform in this period, arguing that it interfered with a community's right to determine common rest times.\\"121 stores charged in Sunday opening\\", Globe and Mail, 9 December 1986, A19. Blaikie said, \\"To my mind, Sunday shopping is one of the final victories of capitalism, of Mammon, and the idolatry of commodity fetishism. Our Constitution says that we recognize the supremacy of God. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of Sunday shopping, why do we not drop the pretense and rewrite it to read supremacy of the market place?\\" He was promoted to External Affairs Critic in September 1987.Graham Fraser, \\"Jewett replaced by NDP as external affairs critic\\", Globe and Mail, 14 September 1987, A4. One of his first major policy statements in this portfolio was to call for Canada to stop allowing American cruise missile tests over its territory.\\"Stop testing cruise, opposition MPs urge\\", Globe and Mail, 27 October 1987, A5. He was also critical of Canada's proposed Free Trade Agreement with the United States, and released a document entitled A Time To Choose Canada, the New Democrats' Trade Option with fellow MP Steven Langdon in February 1988.Peter Cook, \\"The visionaries of the NDP go backward into the future\\", Globe and Mail, 5 February 1988, B2. As may be evident from the article title, Cook was critical of the NDP document. He also served as co-chairman of the NDP's international affairs committee, and held consultation meetings on whether or not the party should reaffirm its traditional opposition to Canadian membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.Susan Delacourt, \\"Few changes expected in NDP's NATO stand after weekend meeting\\", Globe and Mail, 1 February 1998, A8. Blaikie considered running for the leadership of the New Democratic Party of Manitoba in 1988, following the surprise resignation of Howard Pawley. He eventually chose not to run, and did not endorse any other candidate.Ross Howard, \\"'Courageous' move called best hope\\", Globe and Mail, 10 March 1988, A1; Richard Cleroux and Geoffrey York, \\"Doer favored to win Manitoba NDP leadership race\\", Globe and Mail, 15 March 1988, A4. He was retained as the NDP's External Affairs Critic after the Progressive Conservatives won a second consecutive majority government in the 1988 federal election, and was also chosen as his party's spokesman for federal–provincial relations and the Constitution.Tim Harper, \\"Ottawa looking at improving links to PLO, Clark says\\", Toronto Star, 9 March 1989, A1. In this article, Blaikie was quoted as saying, \\"The sooner Canada catches up on this, the better.

There were rumours that Blaikie would seek the federal New Democratic Party leadership after Ed Broadbent's resignation in 1989, but he declined to run and instead supported Simon de Jong, whom he described as having the greatest awareness of environmental issues.Rosemary Speirs, \\"NDP hopefuls heading for the post\\", Toronto Star, 21 January 1989, D5; Tim Harpur, \\"7 hopefuls emerge as contenders for Ed's job\\", Toronto Star, 5 March 1989, A1. Sources indicate that Blaikie was holding off from declaring his candidacy, pending a decision from fellow MP Nelson Riis. See Tim Harper, \\"Reluctant Riis reconsiders bid for leadership of NDP\\", Toronto Star, 12 June 1989, A9. See \\"Six NDP MPs endorse de Jong for leader\\", Globe and Mail, 7 October 1989, A5. When de Jong was eliminated on the second ballot at a delegated convention, Blaikie moved to the camp of Audrey McLaughlin, the eventual winner.Alan Freeman, \\"NDP chooses a leader\\", Globe and Mail, 4 December 1989, A10. Blaikie was appointed as NDP Taxation Critic in 1990. He opposed the Mulroney government's decision to cut social programs to pay down the deficit, calling instead for a tightening of tax loopholes.\\"Personal tax load higher, study says\\", Toronto Star, 20 June 1991, B1; \\"Grasping the deficit nettle\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 April 1993. He was given further responsibilities as Transport Critic, and spoke against proposed job cuts at Canadian National.Brian Pardoe, \\"Ex-CN chief recommends job cuts\\", Globe and Mail, 6 August 1992, B5. =Chrétien government (1993–2003)= In parliament Blaikie's closest election came in 1993, when the Liberal Party under Jean Chrétien defeated the Progressive Conservatives under new leader Kim Campbell to win a majority government. The New Democratic Party's support base had fallen in this period, due to unpopular decisions made by the provincial NDP governments of Bob Rae in Ontario and Michael Harcourt in British Columbia. Blaikie defeated Liberal candidate Art Miki by only 219 votes in Winnipeg—Transcona while his party fell from 44 to 9 seats nationally. Between 1993 and 1997, Blaikie was the only New Democratic Party MP to represent a riding east of Saskatchewan. He was appointed as NDP Critic for Foreign Affairs and Trade after the election, and served another term as caucus chairman from 1993 to 1996.\\"Uncertainty swirls around McLaughlin's status with NDP\\", Hamilton Spectator, 5 May 1994, A9; Francine Dube, \\"Esteemed MP strictly left-wing\\", National Post, 6 June 2002, A11. In early 1994, Blaikie won unanimous support in the House of Commons for a Private Member's Bill calling for the government to officially recognize Canadians who served in the Dieppe Raid in World War II. He initially proposed that a special medal to be struck, but later accepted a Liberal amendment for a \\"distinctive decoration\\".\\"Dieppe vets to get decoration\\", Globe and Mail, 12 April 1994, A1. He was disappointed with the final result, a simple silver bar with ribbon attachment that was given to all service personnel from 1939 to 1943.Nick Martin, \\"Dieppe vet insulted as feds water down bid for medals\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 August 1994. Blaikie voted against the Chrétien government's gun registry in 1995, arguing that it did not address the real problems of gun-related violence.Tony Davis, \\"Gunfight at the Dauphin corral\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 March 1995; Dan Lett, \\"Outlaw Grits say no to party's gun bill\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 April 1995; Aldo Santin, \\"Senate seen as final hope\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 June 1995, A9. He strongly opposed the government's decision to sell off CN Rail in the same year. See Linda Quattrin, \\"Sale of CN Rail lamented\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 May 1995. There were again rumours that Blaikie would run for the NDP leadership in 1995, but he declined and gave his support to Lorne Nystrom.Susan Delacourt, \\"NDP plans to redesign the left McLaughlin to give up helm\\", Globe and Mail, 19 April 1994, A1; \\"Race to replace McLaughlin off to quiet start\\", Globe and Mail, 10 April 1995, N9. Some party insiders indicated that Blaikie would have been the preferred choice of Audrey McLaughlin and Glen Clark. See Doug Fischer, \\"Remember the federal NDP?\\", Hamilton Spectator, 17 January 1995, A7. When Nystrom was eliminated at the party's convention, Blaikie shifted his support to the winner, Alexa McDonough.Shawn McCarthy, \\"New Democrats pick McDonough\\", Toronto Star, 15 October 1995, A1. The duties of NDP MPs were shuffled after the leadership convention. Blaikie was named as House Leader, while continuing as International Trade Critic and adding the Intergovernmental Affairs portfolio.\\"McDonough's caucus gets marching orders\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 January 1996, A12; Terrence Wills, \\"Costly election campaign: Running 'paper candidates' in Quebec part of party's national commitment, NDP Leader McDonough says\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 4 July 1997, A6; \\"Marchi tries to sell us on treaty\\", Toronto Star, 25 October 1997, 1; \\"Voices\\", Toronto Star, 21 August 1998, A6. He continued to hold these parliamentary roles after the 1997 election, in which the Liberals won a second majority government and the NDP made a partial recovery to 21 seats. Blaikie was re-elected to a seventh term in 2000, as the Liberals won a third majority government under Chrétien. He retained his position as House Leader and Intergovernment Affairs Critic, and gained additional duties as critic for Parliamentary Reform, Justice and the Solicitor-General.Valerie Lawton, \\"Small caucus means NDP members face big workload\\", Toronto Star, 23 January 2001, 1. He played a key role in getting the NDP Caucus to support the Clarity Act in 2000, after securing amendments that were important to First Nations groups in Quebec.\\"Congratulations Canada! Clarity Bill Amended to Include Aboriginal Peoples as Political Actors\\" [press release], Canada NewsWire, 14 March 2000, 15:59.He also brought forward a motion in February 2001 to prohibit talking on a cellphone while driving except in cases of emergency, arguing that the use of cellphones by drivers was causing a public safety hazard. See \\"MP moves to cut off cellphone use in cars\\", Globe and Mail, 3 February 2001, A7. The government decided not to pursue the initiative in May 2002, arguing that regulation should remain a provincial matter. See Janice Tibbetts, \\"Ottawa won't ban cellphones in cars: Up to provinces\\", National Post, 13 May 2002, A5. Ideological views Blaikie emerged as a prominent critic of economic globalization during the mid-1990s. In 1996, he wrote that new rules governing the World Trade Organization would shift oversight of public policy from elected governments to unelected trade bureaucrats.Bill Blaikie, \\"WTO process a threat to democracy\\" [letter], Financial Post, 7 December 1996, 24. He expressed similar concerns about the Multilateral Agreement on Investment two years later, arguing that it put the rights of investors ahead of workers, environments, societies, and cultures.Bill Blaikie, \\"Deal hampers government\\" [letter], Winnipeg Free Press, 14 February 1998, A15. He criticized the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas for similar reasons in 2000. See Allan Thompson, \\"Trade minister side-steps labour issues\\", Toronto Star, 15 June 2000, 1. He wrote the NDP Minority Report on the MAI, which was published in Dismantling Democracy (edited by Andrew Jackson and Matthew Sanger). Blaikie wrote a 1994 editorial calling for the Bank of Canada to hold a larger portion of the national debt at low interest rates, as it did until the mid-1970s, in order for Canada to reduce its deficit while maintaining its core social programs.Bill Blaikie, \\"Change monetary policy\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 14 October 1994. In 1998, he led a national campaign against proposed mergers for Canada's major banks.Paul Samyn, \\"NDP hopes to cash in on merger backlash\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 May 1998, B2. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the New Democratic Party members were divided as to the party's position on the Canadian political spectrum. Some wanted to take the party into a more centrist direction, similar to Tony Blair's \\"Third Way\\" in Britain, while others sought to move in a radical left-wing direction. Blaikie was not closely affiliated with either camp. He opposed Blair's ideological approach on the grounds that it was too closely aligned with corporate interests.Paul Samyn, \\"NDP wants change, wants to stay the same\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 August 1999, A7. He participated in anti-globalization protests in Seattle and Quebec City but also criticized the extra-parliamentary left's tactics, saying that protests would never bring economic change without mobilization in the political sphere.Frances Russell, \\"Best of times is worst of times for NDP\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 July 2001, A10; Bill Blaikie, \\"NDP must speak from the heart again\\", Toronto Star, 15 January 2003, A25. He opposed the New Politics Initiative at the NDP's 2001 convention, calling instead for a renewal of the existing party organization.Valerie Lawton, \\"NDP rejects demands for new left-wing party\\", Toronto Star, 25 November 2001, A3. Leadership campaign Blaikie was the first declared candidate in the 2003 leadership election. He called for a renewed focus on health care, natural resources and labour standards.Krista Foss, \\"NDP leadership candidate aims to heal party wounds\\", Globe and Mail, 18 June 2002, A10. Blaikie was seen as a representative of the party's moderate left, fitting ideologically between the centrist Lorne Nystrom and the more left-wing Jack Layton. He was supported by MPs Pat Martin, Judy Wasylycia-Leis, Bev Desjarlais, Wendy Lill, Yvon Godin and Dick Proctor, Manitoba Premier Gary Doer, New Democratic Party of Ontario leader Howard Hampton, and several former MPs including Simon de Jong, Dawn Black, Ian Waddell and Howard McCurdy.Paul Samyn, \\"Blaikie revs up campaign\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 June 2002, A8; \\"Sask.

In declaring his candidacy, he said, The NDP's 2003 leadership convention was the first to be determined by a partial \\"one member, one vote\\" system in which all members of the NDP were eligible to cast ballots. Blaikie finished second to Jack Layton, who appointed him as Deputy Leader after the convention. As Layton did not have a seat in the Commons, Blaikie also served as the NDP's parliamentary leader until the 2004 federal election.Paul Samyn, \\"Blaikie to lead New Democrats in Parliament\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 January 2003, A7. This led to his being sworn in as a member of the Privy Council. He was also named as the NDP's National Defence Critic,\\"Layton gives Manitobans new jobs in NDP caucus shuffle\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 February 2003, A8. and was front and centre in pushing the Liberals to not participate in the Iraq War, in opposing Canadian participation in ballistic missile defence, and in asking questions about the rules of engagement and changing role of Canadian troops in Afghanistan.Tonda McCharles, \\"PM willing to look at missile defence plan\\", Toronto Star, 6 May 2003, A3; Mike Trickey, \\"PM refuses opposition demands to rule out role in war without UN\\", National Post, 13 February 2003, 18 February 2003, A3; Mike Blanchfield, \\"NDP MP urges guidelines on Afghan prisoner swaps\\", Ottawa Citizen, 30 September 2005, A5. =Martin government (2003–06)= Paul Martin succeeded Jean Chrétien as leader of the Liberal Party in November 2003 and as Prime Minister of Canada in December 2003, and called a new election for June 2004. During this campaign, Blaikie openly disagreed with Layton's proposal that the Clarity Act be repealed.Jonathan Fowlie and Steven Chase, \\"Blaikie disagrees with Layton on Clarity Act\\", Globe and Mail, 31 May 2004, A6. The Liberals were reduced to a minority government, and the NDP increased its representation from 14 to 19 seats.

Following the resumption of parliament in April, Blaikie was named as Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons.Paul Samyn, \\"Veteran MP Blaikie named deputy speaker\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 April 2006, A3. This position largely removed him from the day-to-day business of House debates, and put him in the role of a non-partisan overseer. =Parliamentary reform= Blaikie was an advocate for the reform of parliamentary institutions throughout his time in parliament. He served as second vice-chairman of an all-party committee on parliamentary reform in 1985,George Bain, [editorial], Globe and Mail, 27 January 1986, A6. which among other things made it easier for private member's bills to come to a vote.Richard Cleroux, \\"Backbenchers get chance to present views\\", Globe and Mail, 29 March 1986, A3.

The current president is Washington Post reporter Michelle Ye Hee Lee. The executive director is Naomi Tacuyan Underwood. The organization's goals are: * To provide a means of association and support among Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) journalists, and to advance AAPI journalists as news managers and media executives. * To provide encouragement, information, advice and scholarship assistance to AAPI students who aspire to professional journalism careers. * To provide to the AAPI community an awareness of news media and an understanding of how to gain fair access. * To research and point out when news media organizations stray from accuracy and fairness in the coverage of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and AAPI issues. The organization's membership includes anyone who works in media and identifies as Asian American or is an ally. AAJA's diverse membership includes broadcast anchors, print reporters, editors, producers, videographers, columnists, photojournalists, freelancers, academics, professors, students as well as those who work in film and online media. The membership also consists of many associates in business and public relations sectors. Close to one-third of AAJA's members are students.  History  The Asian American Journalists Association was founded in 1981 by several Los Angeles-based Asian American journalists, including Tritia Toyota and Bill Sing in order to support greater participation by Asian Americans in the news media. It began by encouraging, nurturing and supporting high school and college students through scholarships. The founders also wanted to improve the image of Asian Americans at a time when the demographic was largely invisible in mass media. Inspired by the creation of the National Association of Black Journalists in 1975 as well as the Los Angeles-based California Chicano News Media Association, Sing, a 23-year-old Los Angeles Times reporter at the time, serendipitously met KNBC-TV anchor Tritia Toyota at a student night at UCLA in 1981 and consequently mentioned the idea of forming a similar organization. The two would soon become the leaders of the Original Six who got together in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo Service Center to form AAJA. The other members of the Original Six were David Kishiyama and Nancy Yoshihara of the Los Angeles Times, TV producer Frank Kwan, and Dwight Chuman, an editor of a local Japanese American newspaper. Envisioned as a professional and educational group, AAJA attracted 50 Asian American journalists at its first social event. \\"There were more Asian American journalists under one roof than I ever imagined were in the business,\\" said Kishiyama. \\"We all immediately drew strength from one another, and the feeling of isolation I had felt evaporated overnight.\\" Building on the momentum of the first social event, the founders knew they had to spread the word that AAJA was out there. A scholarship banquet was organized and NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw was the featured speaker for the event. More than 350 supporters, including city officials, media company representatives, and community folks attended the banquet. The dinner raised $18,000 for scholarships. Despite the banquet's success, there was still skepticism at the time among journalists who were leery about being part of AAJA or similar organizations. The founders understood the predicament of being professionally independent and being part of an organization that was political in nature. But it was also around this time that some of the nation's newsrooms were starting to develop programs to recruit minorities into the industry. Many of the newsrooms seeking help in reaching parity in their newsrooms turned to minority journalism organizations like AAJA, NABJ and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, which was founded in 1984. By 1985, AAJA had 100 dues-paying members scattered across the country. AAJA's first executive director, Karen Seriguchi, was hired and soon chapters were formed in San Francisco, Sacramento, Washington, D.C., Hawaii and San Diego. By July 1987, membership reached 350 and more chapters were formed, including Detroit, Chicago, New York, Portland, New England, Florida and Denver.  Chapters  There are 19 chapters in the United States and one chapter representing Asia members. California alone has four chapters: Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Sacramento. In addition to Los Angeles, the largest chapters are New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, D.C. and the Asia chapter. Members who do not geographically reside in any of the chapter cities are considered At-Large members and include journalists spanning the globe from Paris to Bangladesh.  Affinity groups  AAJA affinity groups are specialized groups of AAJA members organized by vocation or interest, each led by a director or co-director. They strive to recruit new members and identify and pursue training and networking opportunities that meet members’ evolving and unique needs, as well as connect current AAJA members regardless of geography or career level.  National conference  AAJA holds an annual conference each summer in the United States where more than 800 Asian American journalists and allies attend each year for the workshops, plenaries, keynote speakers, job fair, and awards banquet. The three-day conference is the largest gathering of Asian journalists in the world. The conference has been held annually since 1987. Speakers, including keynote speakers, have included news pioneers Al Neuharth and Connie Chung, former United States President Bill Clinton, former United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, civil rights leader John Lewis and former international correspondent-anchor for NBC News Ann Curry. Yearly sponsors of the conference have included the major network news stations (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox), newspapers (The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal), sports media (ESPN), online media (Vox Media, Bleacher Report) as well as universities with journalism programs (Columbia University, CUNY, University of Southern California). Cities with large media industries as well as large Asian populations are often chosen as hosts. Recent host cities include Atlanta, Houston, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, San Francisco and New York City. The AAJA 2020 conference will be held in Washington D.C. from July 29 to August 1, 2020. The Asia chapter holds its own conference annually in Hong Kong.  National programs  AAJA has several programs that cater to different experience levels within its membership, starting from high school to mid-career professionals. The programs run annually with application windows open either at the end of the calendar year, or at the beginning of the new year. Programs are funded with foundation support and contributions from media sponsors. = VOICES (College Program) = Voices is a summer multimedia journalism fellowship for undergraduate and graduate college students. Each year, a group of students are selected to work remotely part-time to report on issues related to Asian Americans. Professional mentors guide students through their assignments and provide a newsroom experience. Students also attend remote trainings while they work on their assignments in groups. Students that participate in the Voices newsroom are invited to the AAJA National Convention at the end of the summer to present their reports and to attend the convention. Travel and lodging are covered for students who are selected to participate. Since its founding in 1990, Voices has graduated hundreds of students who would go on to work in the media industry. The program's cohort of graduates include 27 published authors, 15 Emmy Award winners, seven Pulitzer Prize recipients, four Edward R. Murrow Award winners and two Peabody Award winners. = JCamp (High School Program) = JCamp is a selective national journalism program for high school students. It strives to confront the lack of diversity within the industry, in regards to race, religion, identity, geography, sexual orientation and socioeconomic status. The six-day training brings together a multicultural group of teenagers to sharpen journalism skills and work together in a unique learning environment. The curriculum consists of interactive workshops, hands-on training and field trips that emphasize cross-cultural communication, ethics, leadership and networking. Students demonstrate a keen interest in broadcast, newspaper, magazine, photojournalism or online media. JCamp is open to high school freshmen, sophomores and juniors from all backgrounds. There is no fee to apply and all expenses are covered. The program was founded in 2001 by Star Tribune reporter Neal Justin, Sacramento Bee reporter Josh Freedom du Lac and Philadelphia Daily News reporter Mark Angeles as a response to the media industry's diversity crisis. More than 750 students have graduated JCamp since its inception, and alumni have been recognized with the highest honors in the news business. Approximately 75% of the program's graduates have gone on to pursue a journalism degree after graduating high school. Speakers have included Hoda Kotb, co-host of NBC's Today Show; Kevin Merida, editor-in-chief of The Undefeated; Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The New York Times; Jemele Hill, writer for The Atlantic; Wesley Lowery, correspondent for 60 Minutes; Seung Min Kim, White House reporter at the Washington Post; Cheryl Diaz Meyer, Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer; Byron Pitts, co-anchor of Nightline; Chuck Todd, host of Meet the Press; talk show host Jimmy Kimmel; Jill Abramson, former executive editor of The New York Times; Carl Bernstein, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate reporter; Tucker Carlson, anchor for Fox News; David Rhodes, former president of CBS News; Soledad O'Brien, former CNN anchor; Bob Schieffer, former moderator of Face the Nation; Gwen Ifill, former co-host of PBS NewsHour; and Dennis Swanson, creator of The Oprah Winfrey Show. MSNBC anchor Richard Lui, former CNN anchor Joie Chen, Politico deputy editor Clea Benson, former AAJA President Paul Cheung, Minnesota Public Radio President Duchesne Drew, Associated Press reporter Bobby Calvan and Star Tribune photo editor Kyndell Harkness have all taught at the program. Alumni have been recognized with the highest honors in journalism, including more than a dozen Emmy Awards, the Peabody Award and the Pulitzer Prize. Alums include filmmaker Jeff Orlowski, news anchor Terrell Brown, Washington Post reporter Arelis Hernandez, Wall Street Journal photo editor Timmy Huynh, ESPN reporter Brett Okamoto, CNN producer Julia Chan, CNN reporter Brian Fung, The Courier-Journal reporter Alfred Miller, Los Angeles Times reporter Sandhya Kambhampati, filmmaker Adam Khalil, reporter Taylor Mirfendereski and fitness entrepreneur Jackelyn Ho. = Executive Leadership Program (ELP) = The Executive Leadership Program is a week-long professional development workshop committed to journalistic excellence and leadership training. The program provides targeted professional development to diverse, high-potential, ambitious, and community-minded professionals. ELP also provides follow-up trainings for graduates at the annual AAJA National Convention. The program is open to all journalists who apply, regardless of membership to AAJA. The program has trained more than 500 media professionals since 1995. In 2018, ELP was held at the City University of New York (CUNY). In 2019, the 24th class of ELP held its program at ABC News in New York City. Also in 2019, the program expanded to include an inaugural ELP Asia with the program held in Hong Kong. = Mentor Match = The yearlong mentoring program pairs mentees with experienced mentors in the media industry in the United States as well as in Asia, through AAJA's Asia chapter. Applications for both mentors and mentees usually open by the end of the calendar year, with matches announced by March of the following year. Several factors are used in determining mentor/mentee pairings, including geography, gender, medium (print, online, broadcast, photography, etc.), and career interests. In recent years, Mentor Match has been able to provide mentors who work outside of traditional newsroom positions, including those who work as data journalists or as documentary film producers. In 2018, 130 mentor/mentee matches were made with applications coming from 27 states and internationally. Out of the mentors in the 2018 class, 51% had more than 10 years of experience. On the other end, 43% of mentees were students and 49% had less than five years of experience.  MediaWatch  AAJA MediaWatch is a civic engagement committee consisted of AAJA members who are media professionals. The committee seeks to hold media organizations accountable to standards of accuracy and fairness in the coverage of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and their issues. In consultation with AAJA's president, the all-volunteer committee considers and issues statements on AAJA's behalf. In 2016, AAJA MediaWatch issued a statement demanding an apology from Fox News for a segment aired on Oct. 3rd that mocked Asian Americans in New York's Chinatown. The segment by Jesse Watters of \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\" was called \\"offensive\\" by The Washington Post and Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said Watters \\"should be ashamed.\\" AAJA also met privately with an “O’Reilly Factor” executive producer, along with other national and local community leaders, at the Museum of Chinese in America in New York City. AAJA MediaWatch issued guidance in February 2020 urging news outlets to refrain from images and language that fuel xenophobia and racism amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Following that in March, MediaWatch issued a joint statement along with other media organization partners denouncing the escalating violence and anti-Asian rhetoric aimed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, including journalists, amid the pandemic.  Achievements  AAJA is one of the founding organizations and a partner organization of UNITY: Journalists of Color, Inc. along with the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), the National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ), and the Native American Journalists Association (NAJA). In 2019, the Features forum of the AAJA teamed up with the African American Film Critics Association (AAFCA), GALECA: The Society of LGBTQ Entertainment Critics, the Latino Entertainment Journalists Association (LEJA), the Online Association of Female Film Critics (OAFFC) and Time's Up Entertainment to form the Critics Groups for Equality in Media to help foster greater diversity in entertainment journalism through various initiatives including a \\"watchdog\\" grading system.

The simplest of these strategies was designed for a game in which the gambler wins the stake if a coin comes up heads and loses it if the coin comes up tails. The strategy had the gambler double the bet after every loss, so that the first win would recover all previous losses plus win a profit equal to the original stake. The martingale strategy has been applied to roulette as well, as the probability of hitting either red or black is close to 50%. Since a gambler with infinite wealth will, almost surely, eventually flip heads, the martingale betting strategy was seen as a sure thing by those who advocated it. None of the gamblers possessed infinite wealth, and the exponential growth of the bets would eventually bankrupt \\"unlucky\\" gamblers who chose to use the martingale. The gambler usually wins a small net reward, thus appearing to have a sound strategy. However, the gambler's expected value does indeed remain zero (or less than zero) because the small probability that the gambler will suffer a catastrophic loss exactly balances with the expected gain. In a casino, the expected value is negative, due to the house's edge. The likelihood of catastrophic loss may not even be very small. The bet size rises exponentially. This, combined with the fact that strings of consecutive losses actually occur more often than common intuition suggests, can bankrupt a gambler quickly. Intuitive analysis The fundamental reason why all martingale-type betting systems fail is that no amount of information about the results of past bets can be used to predict the results of a future bet with accuracy better than chance. In mathematical terminology, this corresponds to the assumption that the win-loss outcomes of each bet are independent and identically distributed random variables, an assumption which is valid in many realistic situations. It follows from this assumption that the expected value of a series of bets is equal to the sum, over all bets that could potentially occur in the series, of the expected value of a potential bet times the probability that the player will make that bet. In most casino games, the expected value of any individual bet is negative, so the sum of many negative numbers will also always be negative. The martingale strategy fails even with unbounded stopping time, as long as there is a limit on earnings or on the bets (which is also true in practice). It is only with unbounded wealth, bets and time that it could be argued that the martingale becomes a winning strategy. Mathematical analysis The impossibility of winning over the long run, given a limit of the size of bets or a limit in the size of one's bankroll or line of credit, is proven by the optional stopping theorem. Mathematical analysis of a single round Let one round be defined as a sequence of consecutive losses followed by either a win, or bankruptcy of the gambler. After a win, the gambler \\"resets\\" and is considered to have started a new round. A continuous sequence of martingale bets can thus be partitioned into a sequence of independent rounds. Following is an analysis of the expected value of one round. Let q be the probability of losing (e.g. for American double-zero roulette, it is 20/38 for a bet on black or red). Let B be the amount of the initial bet. Let n be the finite number of bets the gambler can afford to lose. The probability that the gambler will lose all n bets is qn. When all bets lose, the total loss is :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n B \\\\cdot 2^{i-1} = B (2^{n} - 1) The probability the gambler does not lose all n bets is 1 − qn. In all other cases, the gambler wins the initial bet (B.) Thus, the expected profit per round is :(1-q^n) \\\\cdot B - q^n \\\\cdot B (2^n - 1) = B (1 - (2q)^n) Whenever q > 1/2, the expression 1 − (2q)n < 0 for all n > 0\\\\. Thus, for all games where a gambler is more likely to lose than to win any given bet, that gambler is expected to lose money, on average, each round. Increasing the size of wager for each round per the martingale system only serves to increase the average loss. Suppose a gambler has a 63 unit gambling bankroll. The gambler might bet 1 unit on the first spin. On each loss, the bet is doubled. Thus, taking k as the number of preceding consecutive losses, the player will always bet 2k units. With a win on any given spin, the gambler will net 1 unit over the total amount wagered to that point. Once this win is achieved, the gambler restarts the system with a 1 unit bet. With losses on all of the first six spins, the gambler loses a total of 63 units. This exhausts the bankroll and the martingale cannot be continued. In this example, the probability of losing the entire bankroll and being unable to continue the martingale is equal to the probability of 6 consecutive losses: (10/19)6 = 2.1256%. The probability of winning is equal to 1 minus the probability of losing 6 times: 1 − (10/19)6 = 97.8744%. The expected amount won is (1 × 0.978744) = 0.978744. The expected amount lost is (63 × 0.021256)= 1.339118. Thus, the total expected value for each application of the betting system is (0.978744 − 1.339118) = −0.360374 . In a unique circumstance, this strategy can make sense. Suppose the gambler possesses exactly 63 units but desperately needs a total of 64. Assuming q > 1/2 (it is a real casino) and he may only place bets at even odds, his best strategy is bold play: at each spin, he should bet the smallest amount such that if he wins he reaches his target immediately, and if he doesn't have enough for this, he should simply bet everything. Eventually he either goes bust or reaches his target. This strategy gives him a probability of 97.8744% of achieving the goal of winning one unit vs. a 2.1256% chance of losing all 63 units, and that is the best probability possible in this circumstance. However, bold play is not always the optimal strategy for having the biggest possible chance to increase an initial capital to some desired higher amount. If the gambler can bet arbitrarily small amounts at arbitrarily long odds (but still with the same expected loss of 1/19 of the stake at each bet), and can only place one bet at each spin, then there are strategies with above 98% chance of attaining his goal, and these use very timid play unless the gambler is close to losing all his capital, in which case he does switch to extremely bold play. Alternative mathematical analysis The previous analysis calculates expected value, but we can ask another question: what is the chance that one can play a casino game using the martingale strategy, and avoid the losing streak long enough to double one's bankroll. As before, this depends on the likelihood of losing 6 roulette spins in a row assuming we are betting red/black or even/odd. Many gamblers believe that the chances of losing 6 in a row are remote, and that with a patient adherence to the strategy they will slowly increase their bankroll. In reality, the odds of a streak of 6 losses in a row are much higher than many people intuitively believe. Psychological studies have shown that since people know that the odds of losing 6 times in a row out of 6 plays are low, they incorrectly assume that in a longer string of plays the odds are also very low. When people are asked to invent data representing 200 coin tosses, they often do not add streaks of more than 5 because they believe that these streaks are very unlikely. This intuitive belief is sometimes referred to as the representativeness heuristic. Anti- martingale This is also known as the reverse martingale. In a classic martingale betting style, gamblers increase bets after each loss in hopes that an eventual win will recover all previous losses. The anti-martingale approach instead increases bets after wins, while reducing them after a loss. The perception is that the gambler will benefit from a winning streak or a \\"hot hand\\", while reducing losses while \\"cold\\" or otherwise having a losing streak. As the single bets are independent from each other (and from the gambler's expectations), the concept of winning \\"streaks\\" is merely an example of gambler's fallacy, and the anti-martingale strategy fails to make any money. If on the other hand, real-life stock returns are serially correlated (for instance due to economic cycles and delayed reaction to news of larger market participants), \\"streaks\\" of wins or losses do happen more often and are longer than those under a purely random process, the anti-martingale strategy could theoretically apply and can be used in trading systems (as trend-following or \\"doubling up\\").

Cork, a common bulletin board material A bulletin board (pinboard, pin board, noticeboard, or notice board in British English) is a surface intended for the posting of public messages, for example, to advertise items wanted or for sale, announce events, or provide information. Bulletin boards are often made of a material such as cork to facilitate addition and removal of messages, as well as a writing surface such as blackboard or whiteboard. A bulletin board which combines a pinboard (corkboard) and writing surface is known as a combination bulletin board. Bulletin boards can also be entirely in the digital domain and placed on computer networks so people can leave and erase messages for other people to read and see, as in a bulletin board system. Bulletin boards are particularly prevalent at universities. They are used by many sports groups and extracurricular groups and anything from local shops to official notices. Dormitory corridors, well-trafficked hallways, lobbies, and freestanding kiosks often have cork boards attached to facilitate the posting of notices. At some universities, lampposts, bollards, trees, and walls often become impromptu posting sites in areas where official boards are sparse in number. Internet forums are a replacement for traditional bulletin boards. Online bulletin boards are sometimes referred to as message boards. The terms bulletin board, message board and even Internet forum are interchangeable, although often one bulletin board or message board can contain a number of Internet forums or discussion groups. An online board can serve the same purpose as a physical bulletin board. Magnet boards, or magnetic bulletin boards, are a popular substitute for cork boards because they lack the problem of board deterioration from the insertion and removal of pins over time.  History  * 1801: James Pillans, headmaster and geography teacher at the Old High School in Edinburgh, Scotland, is credited with inventing the first modern blackboard. * 1925: George Brooks of Topeka, Kansas is issued a patent for the use of corkboard as a bulletin board which you could stick tacks into. The patent for George Brooks' invention, which would become a mainstay in homes and offices around the world, expired in 1941, which then allowed anyone to create and market their own versions of the product. * 1940: George E. Fox, received a patent for a foam rubber pinboard with cardboard backing * 1959: W.F. Lewis is issued a patent for a combined chalkboard and bulletin board. * 1976: The concept of the bulletin board entered the information age when software developers Ward Christensen and Randy Suess launched the first public dialup Bulletin board system. * 2006: High resolution digital bulletin board system first proposed by Dr. Pumpernickel * 2010: Digital signage displays started to replace bulletin boards as a means to reduce clutter and provide real-time information. * 2010: Pinterest, a content and photo-sharing website meant to serve as online personal bulletin boards, is founded by Ben Silbermann, Paul Sciarra and Evan Sharp. * 2017: General Enchantment is issued a utility patent for a physical electronic bulletin board system, that includes a physical writing or pinning surface and an electronic display, like a mobile computing device (Tablet Computer), capable of running (digital signage) software that augments the sharing of analogue information with digital content.

Scholars consider most of the available information on Alexander to be legendary. Origin and early life Information from the Synaxarion mention that Alexander was originally from Calabria in Italy and his parents were George and Vryaine. From very young he was given to God and stayed in a Monastery, where he cultivated virtue and became a good labourer of God's commands. He was granted divine visions, while for twenty days he stayed completely fasting. But he also stayed naked for four years and fell into thousands of problems because of attacks of the Saracens. In this way, he lived many years travelling around Greece with his pupils Vitalius and Nicephorus. Alexander was elected as a vicar to assist the aged bishop Saint Metrophanes of Byzantium. As a result, both Alexander and Metrophanes are reported as the first Bishop of Constantinople (both are also sometimes listed as first \\"Patriarch\\" of Constantinople, though the episcopal see had not yet been elevated to that rank).See Canon iii, First Council of Constantinople, 359 AD Alexander served as bishop for about 23 years, until his death at 73 years of age, in 337. cites Socrates Scholasticus Hist. ii. 6; Sozomen Hist. iii. 3 At the time of Metrophanes' death, he left instructions in his will to elect his vicar to the throne of Constantinople. During his episcopacy, Alexander engaged in debate with pagan philosophers and opposed heresies. He was highly praised by Gregory Nazianzus cites Gregory Nazianzus, Oration 27 and Epiphanius of Cyprus. cites Epiphanius of Cyprus, Adv. Haer. lxix. 10 Theodoret called him an \\"apostolic\\" bishop. cites Theodoret, Hist. i. 3, cf. Phil. 12 Arian controversy When the Arian controversy began, Alexander, the Patriarch of Alexandria, requested his cooperation in combatting what he perceived to be heresy. cites Theodoret, op. cit. i. 4 According to most sources, Alexander of Constantinople was present at the First Council of Nicaea citesSozomen, op. cit. ii. 29 as Metrophanes' deputy, although some sources state that Metrophanes (who would have been 117 years of age at the time) attended the council personally. At the council, Arius and his teachings were condemned. Later, Arius desired to be received back into the communion of the Church. The Roman Emperor Constantine I, having been convinced by the Eusebians, commanded Alexander to formally receive Arius back. cites Athanasius of Alexandria Ep. ad Serap.; Rufinus, Hist. i. According to Socrates Scholasticus, Arius did not in fact repent of his heresy, but was equivocating, and Bishop Alexander was aware of this. cites Socrates Scholasticus, op. cit. i. 37 Alexander, though threatened by the Eusebians with deposition and banishment, persisted in his refusal to admit Arius back into the Church, and shut himself up in the Church of Hagia Irene (which at that time was the cathedral of Constantinople) in fervent prayer that God would take him from this world rather than be forced to restore someone to communion who he feared was only feigning repentance. As it happened, Arius died on his way to the church, before he could be received back into communion. Death Alexander did not long survive Arius. cites Socrates Scholasticus, op. cit. ii. 6 ; Theodoret, op. cit.i. 19 On his deathbed he was said to have nominated his vicar, Paul, as his successor, and to have warned his clergy against Macedonius, who became bishop of Constantinople in 342 and whose teachings inspired Macedonianism. After his death, Alexander came to be regarded as a saint of the Church. The service in his honor was printed in Venice in 1771. According to some ancient manuscripts, the feast of St Alexander was commemorated on June 2. Today, his feast day is celebrated annually on August 30, in a common commemoration with his fellow Patriarchs of Constantinople John the Faster (582–595, also commemorated on September 2) and Paul the New (780-784).

Calvert, is the former leader of the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party, serving in this role from 2001 to June 6, 2009, when he was succeeded by Dwain Lingenfelter. Early life and career Calvert was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. In 1975, Calvert married Betty Sluzalo of Perdue, Saskatchewan. He received his undergradute degree in economics at the University of Regina. He originally was going to study law, but felt the calling to the ministry of the United Church of Canada. After attending the then-Regina Campus and the St. Andrew's College seminary in Saskatoon, he was ordained as minister of the United Church of Canada in 1976 and served as minister of several rural congregations. From 1979 to 1986, Calvert was the minister of the substantial pastoral charge of Zion United Church in Moose Jaw. Entry into provincial politics He entered provincial politics in the 1986 provincial election, running as a New Democrat on a platform of prohibiting the construction of a proposed casino in Moose Jaw. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the constituency of Moose Jaw South. He was re- elected in the 1991 and 1995 elections in the riding of Moose Jaw Wakamow. He did not run in the 1999 election, and was succeeded by Deb Higgins. Following the resignation of NDP leader and Premier Roy Romanow, Calvert won the NDP leadership, and became premier on February 8, 2001. He was re-elected to the legislature in a by-election in Romanow's riding of Saskatoon Riversdale. Premier of Saskatchewan Calvert and the NDP narrowly defeated the centre- right opposition Saskatchewan Party in the 2003 provincial election. The NDP won 30 seats of the 58 seats in the election. During the campaign, Calvert apologized for an internal cartoon that had been leaked to the media. It depicted Saskatchewan Party leader Elwin Hermanson loading NDP sympathizers onto rail cars. The cartoon referred to speculation that, if elected, Hermanson would replace civil servants who were NDP supporters with Saskatchewan Party supporters.

An internal poll before the election showed that they had only 6% popular support, and some NDP workers privately worried that they could lose all of their legislative seats.Tim Harper, \\"Manitoba parties stagger to the starting line\\", Toronto Star, 13 March 1988, B1; Geoffrey York, \\"Manitoba NDP in uphill battle\\", Globe and Mail, 26 March 1988, D1; Richard Cleroux and Geoffrey York, \\"NDP's 12 seats might have been 0, official admits\\", Globe and Mail, 28 April 1988, A19; Richard Cleroux, \\"Party bounced from office to third place\\", Globe and Mail, 29 April 1988, A8. The party was also $1 million in debt. See Doug Nairne, \\"Doer Die\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 January 1999, A1. Many believed Doer was their best hope for a recovery.Doer himself later acknowledged that he was not yet ready for the take a position of leadership. Daniel Lett, \\"Opposition leader knows he has to win this time\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 September 1999, A17. Support for the NDP increased to 19% during the leadership campaign, and to 23% after Doer was chosen as Pawley's successor. The party nevertheless remained in third place, and faced an uphill struggle in the 1988 election.Geoffrey York, \\"Party still running a poor third in popularity\\", Globe and Mail, 8 April 1988, A4. =1988 election= Doer promised a $58 million tax cut, and opposed the federal government's free trade deal with the United States of America. He indicated that he was open to the possibility of amending the Meech Lake Accord, a federal proposal for constitutional reform.Derek Ferguson, \\"Tough fighting starts now in Manitoba election race\\", Toronto Star, 4 April 1988, A16; Geoffrey York, \\"New Manitoba NDP leader promises tax cut if returned\\", Globe and Mail, 5 April 1988, A4. He also promised to build more community health centres, and supported home renovations for senior citizens and the disabled.Geoffrey York, \\"Tories pledge additional tax cuts\\", Globe and Mail, 8 April 1988, A4. The NDP won 12 out of 57 seats, while the Progressive Conservatives under Gary Filmon won 25 seats and the Liberals under Sharon Carstairs jumped from one seat to twenty. Doer rejected the possibility of forming a coalition government with the Liberals, and the Progressive Conservatives were able to form a minority government with the NDP holding the balance of power.Geoffrey York, \\"Manitoba's NDP will permit Tories to assume power\\", Globe and Mail, 28 April 1988, A1. He was not personally blamed for his party's loss, and continued as party leader. The NDP chose not to defeat Filmon's government during confidence votes in late 1988 and early 1989, as Doer argued the public would not support another election so soon.Geoffrey York, \\"NDP critical, but won't kill Manitoba Tories' budget\\", Globe and Mail, 18 August 1988, A4; \\"Doer goes against non-confidence vote\\", Globe and Mail, 25 May 1989, A13; \\"Manitoba NDP foils Liberal bid to force election\\", Toronto Star, 25 May 1989, A15; Geoffrey York, \\"NDP cites tax breaks, backs Manitoba budget\\", Globe and Mail, 8 June 1989, A14. =Meech Lake Accord= The dominant political issue in Manitoba between 1988 and 1990 was the Meech Lake Accord, which recognized Quebec as a \\"distinct society\\" in Canada and devolved some powers from the federal government to the provinces. The accord required approval from all ten provincial legislatures to become law. The provincial Liberals initially opposed the accord, which meant that Doer's support was necessary for its passage.Thomas Walkom, \\"The man in the driver's seat\\", Globe and Mail, 27 February 1989, A7. In November 1988, Doer indicated that his party would not support the accord unless certain amendments were introduced.Geoffrey York, \\"Amendments demanded Will kill Meech Lake, Manitoba NDP warns\\", Globe and Mail, 24 November 1988, A1. He was later appointed to a provincial panel that held a series of public meetings, and recommended significant changes to the deal.Edison Stewart, \\"Meech Lake pact's future: Manitobans have their say\\", Toronto Star, 6 April 1989, A30; Edison Stewart, \\"Meech Lake pact suffers a major setback\\", Toronto Star, 23 October 1989, A1. Doer also participated in a federal New Democratic Party internal review of its position on the accord. See Ross Howard, \\"NDP support for Meech accord should stay, review concludes\\", Globe and Mail, 13 September 1989, A14; Ross Howard, \\"NDP still split on constitutional accord\\", Globe and Mail, 14 September 1989, A14. The Filmon government also expressed skepticism about the accord, and announced that it too would seek amendments from the federal government. All three Manitoba party leaders agreed to a federally brokered compromise in June 1990, shortly before the accord's official deadline.Tim Harper, \\"Manitoba leaders back plan\\", Toronto Star, 9 June 1990, A8; Tim Harper, \\"Manitoba troika say they'll pass accord in time\\", Toronto Star, 10 June 1990, A14. The accord nonetheless failed to pass in the Manitoba legislature because of a procedural motion from Elijah Harper, a Cree member of the NDP caucus who argued that it did not give fair representation to indigenous Canadians. Doer described Harper's decision as \\"a fundamental issue of conscience\\", and blamed Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for delaying negotiations until the deadline had almost expired.Geoffrey York, \\"Native MLA blocks debate on Meech\\", Globe and Mail, 13 June 1990, A1. One year later, he indicated that he felt \\"betrayed\\" by federal negotiators, and described the entire Meech Lake process as \\"dishonest from start to finish\\".Geoffrey York, \\"Harper deals crushing blow to Meech deal\\", Globe and Mail, 23 June 1990, A6. =1990 election= In the aftermath of the accord's defeat, Filmon called a provincial election for September 11, 1990. Doer promised a ten-year freeze on personal income taxes, and argued that the Progressive Conservatives would pursue a hidden right-wing agenda if they won a majority government.\\"Manitoba Liberals vow to back research\\", Globe and Mail, 21 August 1990, A7; David Roberts, \\"Filmon plan nasty, NDP says\\", Globe and Mail, 18 August 1990, A3. He also promised legislation that would make it more difficult for companies based in Manitoba to close down.\\"Mr. Filmon, and weaker options\\" [editorial], Globe and Mail, 10 September 1990, A12. An early poll showed the NDP in third place with 18% support, well behind the governing Progressive Conservatives and also behind the Liberals.David Roberts, \\"Manitoba Premier calls general election\\", Globe and Mail, 8 August 1990, A2. The Liberal campaign faltered, however, and the New Democrats were able to make strong gains in the election's final days, partly buoyed by the unexpected victory of Bob Rae's New Democrats in the neighbouring province of Ontario.David Roberts and Miro Cernetig, \\"Filmon's Tories win narrow majority\\", Globe and Mail, 12 September 1990, A1. Doer took an aggressive approach in a televised party leaders' debate and sought to link Filmon with Mulroney's increasingly unpopular federal government, highlighting the premier's support for the federal Progressive Conservatives in the 1988 federal election. See David Roberts, \\"Gloves come off in Manitoba race\\", Globe and Mail, 31 August 1990, A4; David Roberts, \\"3 Manitoba party leaders to debate aboriginal issues\\", Globe and Mail, 4 September 1990, A3. The Progressive Conservatives won a narrow majority with 30 seats, while the New Democrats won 20 and the Liberals seven. Doer succeeded Carstairs as Leader of the Opposition in the legislature. Leader of the Opposition =First term, 1990–95= Doer criticized the Filmon government's cutbacks to health and education, and drew attention to the province's rising unemployment and child poverty rates in the early 1990s.Paul Samyn, \\"NDP itching to hit hustings\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 November 1994. Opposing Filmon's austerity measures, he argued it was inappropriate for the government to cut jobs at a time of high unemployment.David Roberts, \\"Manitoba slashes 1,000 jobs, Budget pleases business leaders\\", Globe and Mail, 17 April 1991, A6; \\"Tories slash spending on provincial highways\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 March 1993. In 1993, he opposed the government's decision to end funding for groups such as the Foster Family Association, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, the Manitoba Anti-Poverty Organization and the Manitoba Environmental Council.\\"Tories pull plug on agencies\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 March 1993. Doer also called for Ontario's $13 billion hydro purchase from Manitoba to be renegotiated in 1992, following reports that the Ontario Hydro Board was considering delaying the deal, and in light of the fact that environmental-assessment research was running behind schedule. See David Roberts, \\"Manitoba NDP leader wants hydro deal delayed\\", Globe and Mail, 22 September 1992, A4. Doer announced in late 1992 that his caucus would support the Charlottetown Accord, a comprehensive package on constitutional reform that was introduced by the federal government after the failure of Meech Lake.\\"'No' will doom Canada, PM warns\\", Financial Post, 29 September 1992, p. 6. The Accord was defeated in a national referendum. Doer released an election platform in November 1994, highlighted by a ten-point preventive health-care program for children and a six-point Manitoba Works plan to reduce unemployment.Frances Russell, \\"Hot times under the Dome\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 December 1994. =1995 election= Doer focused on health issues in the 1995 provincial election. He promised that he would replace walk-in clinics with neighbourhood health organizations, to be staffed with salaried doctors, nurses, midwives and social workers.\\"Doer has prescription for community health\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 March 1995. He pledged to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to reduce prescription drug costs, and to review some of the hundreds of drugs that had been delisted in recent years.Alice Krueger, \\"Doer targets drug costs\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 April 1995. He also promised to create a new group of health providers called nurse practitioners, to carry out some doctors' responsibilities.Alice Krueger, \\"New role favored in care\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 April 1995. On economic issues, Doer promised a balanced budget with no personal or sales tax increases over four years and indicated that he would cut nearly $119 million from government programs to fund health, education, and job creation.Alice Krueger, \\"Doer sets spending priorities\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 March 1995. An early poll from the Angus Reid firm showed the Progressive Conservatives with 37% support, the Liberals with 35%, and the NDP with 21%.\\"If election was held yesterday\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 March 1995. Some questioned this poll's accuracy. See David Roberts, \\"Doer practices for last kick at the political can\\", Globe and Mail, 3 April 1995, A4. The Liberal campaign faltered once again, however, and a poll released only days before the election showed the NDP had again surpassed the Liberals for second place.Frances Russell, \\"Health issues push NDP past Liberals\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 April 1995. The poll showed the Progressive Conservatives at 40%, the NDP at 33%, and the Liberals at 27%. The Progressive Conservatives were re-elected with 31 seats, the NDP increased their total to 23, and the Liberals fell to only three. In the closing days of the campaign, Doer asked the province's chief electoral officer to investigate reports that three independent candidates from an unregistered party known as Native Voice had received assistance from a Progressive Conservative campaign official. Some believed these candidates would split the progressive-left vote in their ridings, and give the Progressive Conservatives a greater chance of winning.Alice Krueger, \\"'Dirty' politics alleged\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 April 1995. Little was done at the time, but the story emerged as a prominent provincial scandal following an exposé from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in June 1998. Doer called for an inquiry, which the Filmon government granted; the presiding officer determined that at least one of the candidates had been illegally induced to run to by a local agents of the Progressive Conservative Party.David Kuxhaus, \\"Who bankrolled native candidate in '95 campaign?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 June 1998, A1; David Kuxhaus, \\"PCs yield, call vote inquiry\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 June 1998, A1; David Kuxhaus, \\"Vote charge haunts Tories NDP demands probe\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 June 1998, A1. =Second term, 1995–99= Despite an improving economy, the Filmon government's 1996 budget introduced further cuts to social assistance, health care, and post-secondary and public school education. Doer argued that the cuts were ideological in nature, and not based on financial necessity.Dan Lett, \\"Social program cuts unnecessary: critics\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 April 1996, A3. The government also introduced legislation permitting unionized workers to shield their dues from being donated to political parties. Doer suggested that corporate shareholders should also be allowed to opt out of party donations.Alice Krueger, \\"Union workers can say no\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 April 1996, A4. Doer opposed the Filmon government's decision to privatize the Manitoba Telephone System in 1996, arguing that it would cause Manitobans to lose control over a vital part of their economy.Paul Samyn, \\"MTS sale rings alarm\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 November 1996, B4. A poll in November 2006 showed that 67% of Manitobans opposed the sale, including 78% of rural Manitobans. See David Roberts, \\"Opposition keeps bill to sell Manitoba Telephone on hold\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 November 1996, A5. He called for a referendum, which Filmon rejected.Frances Russell, \\"PCs caught in paradox\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 November 1996, A10. Doer nonetheless accepted the finality of the sale, telling party delegates in 1999 that buying back the service would be too expensive and carry too many risks.David Kuxhaus, \\"Bid to buy back MTS dead: Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 February 1999, A3. Doer also opposed the Filmon government's proposal to water-down the single-desk marketing powers of the Canadian Wheat Board.Paul Samyn, \\"Tories hang up on MTS\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 May 1996, A1; Paul Samyn, \\"NDP demands Tories back wheat board\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 September 1996, B8. He argued there could be no \\"middle-of-the-road\\" position on the Wheat Board, adding that continued single-desk marketing would be \\"in the economic interests of producers and the economic interests of Winnipeg\\".Paul Samyn, \\"Filmon straddles fence in wheat board showdown\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 September 1996, A1. Some New Democrats expressed discontent with Doer's leadership in late 1997. Most notably, a group led by policy committee chairman Victor Olson issued a statement on party renewal that was generally interpreted as a challenge to his leadership.Frances Russell, \\"NDP gets knives out for Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 October 1997, A8; Frances Russell, , Winnipeg Free Press, 8 October 1997, A10; Alice Krueger, \\"Discontent rumbling in NDP\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 November 1997, A1; \\"Doer may have to fight off dissidents as party meets\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 November 1997, A4. This came to nothing, but there was general agreement among party members that Doer would need to win the next election to continue as party leader.Dan Lett, \\"Doer closes in on the do-it stage\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 November 1997, A4: \\"Doer continues as NDP boss\\", Toronto Star, 17 November 1997, p. 1. There was an abortive challenge to Doer's leadership at the party's 1997 convention. Party activist Eduard Hiebert was unable to get the fifty signatures required for a leadership review. See Alice Krueger, \\"Doer quest goes on\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 November 1997, A3. =1999 election= In the buildup to the 1999 provincial election, Doer unveiled a platform that called for balanced budgets, debt repayment and a freeze on taxes.Frances Russell, \\"NDP tries out a new tune\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 December 1998, A14; Brian Cole, \\"Doer's Democrats\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 December 1998, A10. He again emphasized health care as a priority,David Kuxhaus, \\"Fears about health system spreading, survey finds\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 December 1998, A4. and said that his government would stop the practice of using public monies for politically motivated polls and advertisements.\\"NDP doesn't want taxes used to fund political ads\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 March 1999, A9. He also expressed concern that the Progressive Conservatives could privatize Manitoba Hydro,Frances Russell, \\"Hydro sparks to fly in election\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 March 1999, A10. and criticized a provincial workfare initiative as giving too much discretionary power to government overseers.Douglas Nairne, \\"Workfare framework set as legislature passes bill\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 July 1999, 10. The NDP voted to support the Filmon government's 1999 budget, citing the premier's decision to increase health spending with money from a provincial \\"rainy day fund\\".David Kuxhaus, \\"NDP backs Tory budget\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 May 1999, A5. Doer added that, if elected, his party would replace Filmon's budgeted income tax cut with a property tax cut.Frances Russell, \\"Doer crosses his fingers\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 May 1999, A14. The NDP entered the 1999 election in a much stronger position than in the three previous campaigns. A poll taken three years earlier had shown the NDP leading the Progressive Conservatives for the first time since the Pawley administration.Paul Samyn, \\"NDP tops Tories in poll\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 March 1996, A5. The Tories regained their lead by 1998, but fallout from the vote-splitting scandal gave the NDP an 8% lead in a Probe/Free Press poll issued in March 1999.There were several provincial polls released between 1996 and 1999. A poll issued in February 1997 indicated that the NDP had fallen to third place. Doer dismissed this as meaningless, citing the poll's small sample size of one hundred people and its large margin of error. See Frances Russell, \\"Feuding NDP trail Tories, Grits: poll\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 February 1997, A4. In a December 1997 Free Press/Probe Research Inc. poll, the Progressive Conservatives had 36%, the NDP 35%, the Liberals 20%. The Reform Party was at 7%; this party did not have an official provincial wing, but some party members had unofficially fielded a candidate in 1997 by-election. A January 1998 poll, from Angus Reid, showed the PCs and NDP tied at 36% with the Liberals at 28%. See Doug Nairne, \\"Manitobans flee Liberals, poll suggests\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 December 1997, A1; Alice Krueger, \\"Tories, NDP tied in provincial poll\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 January 1998, A7; Frances Russell, \\"PCs show wear and tear\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 January 1998, A10. Another Angus Reid poll in March 1998 showed the Progressive Conservatives with 38%, the NDP with 28%, and the Liberals with 23%. Doer suggested the latter poll was inconsistent with internal surveys. See Stevens Wild, \\"Provincial leaders scoff at poll showing large Tory lead\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 March 1998, A3. A Free Press/Probe Research Inc. poll in March 1998 showed the NDP and Progressive Conservatives at 35% and the Liberals at 26%. In December 1998, a Free Press/Probe Research poll showed the Progressive Conservatives with 38% and the NDP with 35%. See David Kuxhaus, \\"Filmon's Tories take a licking, but they keep on ticking\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 December 1998, A1. For the March 1999 poll, see Brian Cole, \\"Poll results rub Tories raw\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 March 1999, A14. In this period, many began to regard the NDP as a possible government-in- waiting.Frances Russell, \\"Harsh new light on PCs\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 March 1989, A10; Brian Cole, \\"The same old dress\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 March 1989, B4; Paul Sullivan, \\"Gary Doer's star shines bright in Manitoba\\", Globe and Mail, 3 April 1999, D2; David Roberts, \\"It will be close, Filmon says of next election; Manitoba Premier admits the rival NDP has a chance to form the government\\", Globe and Mail, 11 May 1999, A4. Later polls showed the gap between the parties narrowing to a virtual tie.David Roberts, \\"Tories, NDP race neck and neck toward Manitoba's election day\\", Globe and Mail, 4 September 1999, A5; Doug Nairne, \\"Manitoba race gets serious as parties enter home stretch\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 September 1999, A7. Doer pledged $13 million to shorten health-care waiting times in the 1999 campaign, and said that he would work to end \\"hallway medicine\\" in overcrowded hospitals. He also pledged an additional $2 million to hire more nurses and provide incentives for rural doctors.David Kuxhaus, \\"Doer touts $15-M plan to repair health care\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 August 1999, A1. In education, he promised to cut college and university tuition fees by 10% and to invest $24 million to the province's three community colleges.David Kuxhaus, \\"NDP to boost college funding\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 August 1999, A1. On election reform, he promised to ban campaign donations from corporations and unions.Daniel Lett, \\"End big campaign donations, Doer says\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 September 1999, A10. Doer also criticized the Filmon government's handling of a contract with Urban Shared Services Corp., which attempted to save the province money by reheating food for hospitals and seniors' homes at a centralized location. The project went well over-budget, and the food was often criticized as inedible.Scott Edmonds, \\"Front-runners in Manitoba vote focus on health care, tax cuts\\", Globe and Mail, 26 August 1999, A6. A poll released a week before the election showed the NDP and Progressive Conservatives tied with 42% support, and the election was considered too close to call until the actual day of voting.Doug Nairne, \\"Manitoba poll shows NDP and Tories in dead heat\\", Globe and Mail, 17 September 1999, A1. The NDP ultimately won 32 seats, against 24 for the Progressive Conservatives and only one for the Liberals. A collapse of the Liberal vote worked to the NDP's advantage.Douglas Nairne, \\"Doer to gain from Liberals' pain\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 September 1999, A1; Douglas Nairne, \\"It's Premier Doer! Collapse of Liberal vote swings province to NDP\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 September 1999, A1. Premier More than eleven years after declining the option, Doer was sworn in as Premier of Manitoba on October 5, 1999. He also took the position of Minister of Federal/Provincial Relations.David Roberts, \\"Doer takes the stage as Manitoba's new Premier\\", Globe and Mail, 6 October 1999, A1. =Re-election campaigns= After governing for just under four years, Doer called a new provincial election for June 2003. He brought forward a five point re-election plan highlighted by promises to reduce property and income taxes, hire more nurses and doctors and make reductions in medical waiting lists, take a cautious approach to managing the economy, and improve the province's education and law enforcement systems. Many journalists noted similarities to the NDP's 1999 platform.Daniel Lett, \\"Doer touts 5-point plan\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 May 2003, A1; \\"NDP: Day 4\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 May 2003, A4; Daniel Lett, \\"NDP taking aim at nurse shortage\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 May 2003, A4; Daniel Lett, \\"Doer promises to unveil new property tax plan\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 May 2003, A5; Scott Edmonds, \\"NDP unwraps tax cut plans as Manitoba election campaign almost at mid point\\", Canadian Press, 16 May 2003, 16:35; Mia Rabson, \\"Doer promises additional police, Crown attorneys\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 May 2003, A6. The NDP held a massive lead in the polls throughout the campaign, and most observers agreed that its re- election was a foregone conclusion.For instance Thomas Walkom, \\"In moody Manitoba, election is far from mind\\", Toronto Star, 17 May 2003, H1; Scott Edmonds, \\"NDP shows commanding lead in Manitoba election campaign, says poll\\", Canadian Press, 23 May 2003, 16:10; Peter Schroedter, \\"Political fans left without team to cheer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 May 2003, A17; John Dafoe, \\"Bland diet for Manitoba voters\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 May 2003, A12; Daniel Lett, \\"NDP heads for landslide\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 May 2003, A1; Scott Edmonds, \\"Second poll shows Manitoba's N-D-P heading for huge election win\\", Canadian Press, 29 May 2003, 17:44. Even the Winnipeg Free Press, not traditionally supportive of the NDP, urged voters to re-elect Doer's government.\\"Re-elect Mr. Doer\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 31 May 2003, A16. The NDP won an increased majority with 49.47% support and 35 of 57 seats, and made inroads into traditionally Progressive Conservative areas of south Winnipeg. Four years later, Doer called an election for May 2007.Joe Friesen, \\"Manitoba heads to the polls\\", Globe and Mail, 21 April 2007, A6. The election call took place on the same day that Doer stood with Prime Minister Stephen Harper to announce new funding for the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. See Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Izzy Asper's dream lives\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 April 2007, B1; Mia Rabson, \\"Doer's timing as good as it gets\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 April 2007, A5. The NDP campaign focused on Doer's personal popularity and his government's record in office.Steve Lambert, \\"Manitoba's Doer seeks third straight majority\\", Calgary Herald, 21 April 2007, A15. The party released a seven-point re-election plan, focused on health care, the environment, education, tax cuts, public safety, money for highways, and keeping Manitoba Hydro as a public institution.Mia Rabson, \\"700 new nurses pledged\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 April 2007, A5. Doer promised to hire 700 nurses and nurse practitioners, 100 new police officers, 20 new crown prosecutors, and 20 new workplace safety inspectors. He also promised to improve Manitoba's record on vehicle emissions, provide tax credits for caregivers, and phase out the provincial small business tax over three years.\\"Manitoba NDP promises to hire 700 new nurses and nurse practitioners if re-elected\\", Canadian Press, 23 April 2007, 11:05; Mia Rabson, \\"NDP pledges more police, prosecutors to tackle crime\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 April 2007, A4; Mia Rabson, \\"Doer pounds on job safety\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 April 2007, A7; Mia Rabson, \\"Doer's drive to clear the air\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 April 2007, A1; Mary Agnes Welch, \\"NDP offers caregiver $1,020 tax credit\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 May 2007, A5; Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Small business tax to go, Doer says\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 May 2007, A4. The Winnipeg Free Press again supported Doer. See Bob Cox, \\"Editorial - Tipping to Mr. Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 May 2007, A16. The NDP was again re-elected with an increased majority, this time taking 36 of 57 seats. =Prominent cabinet members= Prominent members of Doer's first cabinet included Greg Selinger in Finance, Gord Mackintosh in Justice, David Chomiak in Health and Rosann Wowchuk in Agriculture.David Roberts, \\"Doer takes the stage as Manitoba's new Premier: Five women, two natives included in streamlined 15-member cabinet\\", Globe and Mail, 6 October 1999, A2; Scott Edmonds, \\"Doer cabinet parties in Manitoba --- Rookies, veterans hit theatre's stage for swearing-in\\", Toronto Star, 6 October 1999, 1. Tim Sale replaced Chomiak at Health in October 2004, and was in turn succeeded by Theresa Oswald in 2006.\\"Doer shuffles cabinet, changes Health Minister\\", Globe and Mail, 13 October 2004, A12. Chomiak replaced Mackintosh at Justice in 2006.Joe Friesen, \\"Doer unveils his pre-election cabinet shuffle\\", Globe and Mail, 22 September 2006, A8. Selinger remained as Finance Minister until 2009, when he succeeded Doer as Premier. Wowchuk remains in Agriculture. Jean Friesen served as Doer's Deputy Premier in his first term. She retired in 2003, and Doer chose Rosann Wowchuk as her replacement.David Kuxhaus, \\"Doer names Wowchuk deputy premier\\", Winnipeg Free Pres, 7 June 2003, A3. =Financial policy= The Doer government has introduced an uninterrupted succession of balanced budgets since its first election in 1999. These budgets have generally been cautious, and have sought to balance tax concerns with spending increases. Doer's first budget, delivered in 2000, removed 15,000 low-income Manitobans from the tax rolls and introduced $150 million in tax breaks over three years while projecting a $10 million surplus.David Roberts, \\"Manitoba raises health-care spending\\", Globe and Mail, 11 May 2000, A2. The actual surplus for 2000-01 was $26 million. See David Roberts, \\"Manitoba budget promises more spending, faster tax cuts\\", Globe and Mail, 11 April 2001, A7. His second budget, in 2001, pursued a consciously middle-of-the-road path by increasing government spending on education, health and infrastructure, while also bringing forward tax cuts for corporations and individuals. See David Roberts, \\"Manitoba budget promises more spending, faster tax cuts\\", Globe and Mail, 11 April 2001, A7; Helen Fallding, \\"NDP plays it safe\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 April 2001, A1. The 2002 budget made use of $288 million from Manitoba Hydro over a period of three years, and increased taxes on cigarettes on maintain a balanced budget. See \\"Smokers suffer big tax hit to keep Manitoba in black\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 23 April 2002, A5; David Kuxhaus, \\"Tapping Hydro profits best approach, NDP says\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 April 2002, A13. Doer defended the Hydro decision as a bold move that allowed the province to balance its budget without dipping into the Fiscal Stabilization Fund. See \\"Manitoba legislature wraps up lengthy spring session\\", Canadian Press, 9 August 2002, 12:25. His 2003 budget, the last of his first term, reduced provincial taxes by $82.7 million and increased spending by about 5%, mostly in health and education.Daniel Lett, \\"Spending up, taxes down\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 April 2003, A1; Frances Russell, \\"NDP does just enough to survive\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 April 2003, A14. Manitoba later announced that it would post a deficit for the fiscal year ending in 2003, using a clause in the province's balanced-budget legislation that permits deficit spending to cover emergency expenses. Greg Selinger, Doer's finance minister, cited the damage caused to Manitoba's economy by forest fires, drought and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease). See Mia Rabson, \\"Provincial government faces deficit\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 March 2004, A3. Despite a series of economic setbacks, the government was able to post a balanced budget in 2004 through increased taxes and drug premiums as well as civil service reduction through attrition. Tobacco and liquor taxes were increased and the provincial sales tax expanded to cover more services,Michelle Macafee, \\"Manitoba increases taxes, drug premiums to balance 2004-05 budget\\", Canadian Press, 19 April 2004, 17:45. although Doer rejected a panel recommendation to increase the sales tax by 1%.Leah Janzen, \\"Doer rejects tax plan\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 May 2004, A1. The government was able introduce a more expansive budget in 2005 after an infusion of federal revenues, reducing personal and property taxes, increasing spending by 3.5%, and putting $314 million into a \\"rainy day\\" fund.Mia Rabson, \\"Doer's bonanza budget\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 March 2005, A1. Doer's 2006 and 2007 budgets introduced further tax cuts, and the 2007 budget offered increased education spending and a new child benefit to assist low-income families.Steve Lambert, \\"Manitoba government plans small tax cuts and new law on drug-addicted kids\\", Canadian Press, 5 March 2006, 11:11; Steve Lambert, \\"Tax cuts, new spending promised\\", Globe and Mail, 5 April 2007, A10. At the Manitoba NDP's March 2009 convention, Doer announced that Manitoba would continue its commitment to education, training and research despite a global economic downturn and a slowing economy. He argued that the province was still recovering from the Filmon government's spending cuts during the economic downtown of the 1990s, and that his policies would allow Manitoba to emerge from the recession in a strong, competitive position.Steve Lambert, \\"Recession requires more, not less, social spending: Doer, Layton\\", Canadian Press, 7 March 2009, 04:52pm. His government introduced a balanced budget with economic stimulus programs a few weeks later, even as the global recession forced other provincial governments across Canada into deficit.Doer accessed the province's \\"rainy day fund\\", and committed less money than in past years to paying down the province's debt. See Bruce Owen, \\"Manitoba tables balanced budget in face of recession\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 March 2009, Canwest News Service; \\"Manitoba announces surplus budget\\", National Post, 26 March 2009, A4. Doer encouraged the Bank of Canada to lower its rates in late 2003, saying that the rising strength of the Canadian dollar in relation to the United States dollar was causing increased unemployment.Marian Stinson and Heather Scoffield, \\"Bank faces pressure to trim rates; But most experts expect no cut\\", Globe and Mail, 15 October 2003, B1. He later criticized Bank Governor David Dodge for doing nothing to save Canadian jobs and profits.Daniel Lett, \\"Doer lashes Dodge on buck\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 November 2003, A1. In early 2008, he called for a national strategy to offset the disruptions caused by Canada's soaring dollar.Mia Rabson, \\"Doer urges joint effort on loonie Ottawa, provinces must work together\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 January 2008, A4. In 2004, provincial Auditor General Jon Singleton argued that Manitoba was actually running a deficit due to costs associated with crown corporations, utilities and arm's-length agencies that were not officially counted in the budget. He recommended that Manitoba adopt a system of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Greg Selinger, Doer's Finance Minister, noted that the existing rules were set in place by the Filmon government, and indicated that the NDP had included a summary financial statement to its budget including many of the costs Singleton identified.Daniel Lett, \\"Auditor general urges changes to budget legislation\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 January 2004, B4. The Doer government nevertheless announced in 2005 that it would adopt GAAP.Mia Rabson, \\"Manitoba's rosy finances questioned\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 September 2005, A6. For the first seven years of his administration, Doer was assisted on financial matters by Eugene Kostyra, a cabinet minister from the Pawley government. Kostyra resigned from his position as secretary of Manitoba's Community and Economic Development Committee in late 2006,Paul Samyn, \\"Key Doer aide Kostyra heads for retirement\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 July 2006, B4. and Angela Mathieson was appointed as his replacement.Martin Cash, \\"Premier names his replacement for Kostyra\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 August 2006, A5. =Health= Doer has frequently argued in favour of Canada's public health system.For instance, at the NDP's 2000 annual meeting, he said that Manitoba would lead a national charge to prevent the erosion of medicare. See Douglas Nairne, \\"NDP delegates vow to lead charge against any erosion of medicare\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 March 2000, A4. He criticized Alberta's plan to introduce more private health provisions in 2002, and defended the public system as efficient and less expensive.\\"Manitoba's health facts\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 January 2002, A10; Helen Fallding, \\"Public care is cheaper: Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 January 2002, A1. In the same year, he endorsed Roy Romanow's assessment that the federal government must play a stronger role in health care to prevent more encroachments by the private system.\\"Medicare sickness not fatal: Romanow\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 February 2002, B1. At a presentation before the Romanow Commission in 2002, Doer called for the federal government to double its health care commitment.Thomas Walkom, \\"Romanow gets earful on medicare reform\\", Toronto Star, 7 March 2002, A6. Doer later argued for Canada's publicly funding medical system at a 2003 meeting of federal and provincial first ministers. The meeting resulted in a significant infusion of new money from the federal government, although not as much as the Romanow commission on health care had recommended. See Daniel Lett, \\"In the health-care debate, 'accountability' means cash\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 January 2003, A6; Dennis Bueckert, \\"Federal proposal could change agenda of premiers' health-care meeting\\", Canadian Press, 23 January 2003, 03:06; Tim Harper and Les Whittington, \\"Premiers complain cash doesn't match Romanow findings\\", Toronto Star, 6 February 2003, A1. He later indicated that he was disappointed with the level of health funding included in the Paul Martin government's first federal budget in 2004. See \\"'Unacceptable': Premiers disappointed by lack of new money for health care\\", National Post, 24 March 2004, A6. Two years later, he played a significant role in negotiations that saw the federal government contribute $18 billion in new funding to the provinces over six years.Tonda MacCharles and Mary Gordon, \\"Tough talk did the trick\\", National Post, 16 September 2004, A1; Paul Samyn, \\"Health talks proved Doer an emerging political giant\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 September 2004, B3. The Doer government's first budget included a $135 million increase in health spending, taking total provincial spending to $2.43 billion.David Roberts, \\"Manitoba raises health-care spending\\", Globe and Mail, 11 May 2000, A2. In October 2002, the government announced a long-anticipated $100 million expansion to the Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg, with new operating rooms and emergency departments.\\"Manitoba's largest hospital gets new operating rooms and emergency department\\", Canadian Press, 10 October 2002, 13:40. The government was unable to end \\"hallway medicine\\" in the six-month period it had promised during the 1999 election, and faced the problem of nursing vacancies in the early 2000s.Mia Rabson, \\"NDP still has health-care vows to keep\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 September 2002, A13. Nevertheless, most observers agreed that the provincial situation improved significantly between 1999 and 2003.Daniel Lett, \\"NDP has hallway medicine down but not out\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 May 2003, A4. A Winnipeg Free Press article in 2007 argued that \\"hallway medicine\\" may be properly applied in some circumstances, as a means of monitoring patients who don't necessarily need to be admitted to hospital. See Daniel Lett, \\"Successful politicians survive the Big Lie\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 September 2007, A4. Health spending continued to increase during Doer's second term; a report in December 2004 indicated that Manitoba's per capita health spending was the highest in Canada for the seventh continuous year.Mia Rabson, \\"Manitoba tops nation in health spending\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 December 2004, A12. Doer emerged as a defender of Manitoba's burgeoning internet pharmaceutical industry in the mid-2000s. This industry was very popular among American clients, but nonetheless provoked opposition within both countries.Steve Lambert, \\"Canada's Internet drug industry gets thumbs-up from Minnesota governor\\", Canadian Press, 12 November 2003, 17:13. In 2004, Doer accused federal Health Minister Ujjal Dosanjh of capitulating to American interests by agreeing to increased restrictions on the industry.Paul Samyn, \\"Doer slams health czar\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 December 2004, A1; Graeme Smith, \\"Doer fights crackdown on Internet pharmacies\\", Globe and Mail, 11 January 2005, A10. He later argued that the Canadian government could protect its national drug supply and maintain Manitoba's pharmaceutical sector simply by banning bulk exports.Mia Rabson, \\"Ban bulk drug exports to save jobs: premier\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 February 2005, A3. Doer's government introduced a landmark anti-smoking bill in 2004, banning smoking in all indoor public places and workplaces across the province. Supported by all parties, the legislation was the first of its kind in Canada.Mia Rabson, \\"Smoking ban 'historic'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 March 2004, A1; Mia Rabson, \\"Health issues trump business complaints\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 November 2004, A10. It did not cover Manitobans working in federal government buildings or living on First Nations territory, as these were not under provincial jurisdiction.Leah Janzen, \\"Smoke-ban loophole under fire\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 March 2004, A3; \\"One law for Manitobans\\" [editorial], Globe and Mail, 16 August 2006, A16. Doer welcomed Prime Minister Paul Martin's decision to name Winnipeg as the site of Canada's new public health agency in 2004.Mary Gordon, \\"Winnipeg wins health agency HQ\\", Toronto Star, 18 May 2004, A12. =Social policy= The Doer government passed a bill granting full adoption rights to gay and lesbian couples in 2002. The NDP and Liberals supported the bill, while the Progressive Conservatives voted against it.\\"Bill gives same-sex couples the right to adopt children\\", Guelph Mercury, 2 August 2002, A6. In 2004, the federal government announced that it would introduce legislation to permit the legalization of same-sex marriage in Canada. Federal Justice Minister Irwin Cotler initially indicated that civic officials would be allowed to opt out of performing same-sex marriages if the practice offended their beliefs. Doer criticized this, arguing that provincial employees should not be permitted to discriminate.Campbell Clark, \\"Prairie officials compelled to perform gay marriages\\", Globe and Mail, 18 December 2004, A5. Doer initially declined to express his personal views on the subject, but announced in late 2004 that he supported same-sex marriage as a human right.\\"Manitoba premier says same-sex marriage a right\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 29 December 2004, A3. In April 2005, Doer signed a $176 million deal with the federal government of Paul Martin to expand the provincial day-care sector.\\"'Historic' accord to boost day care\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 April 2005, A1. The project was canceled in 2006 by the new Conservative government of Stephen Harper, over Doer's objections.Philip Authier, \\"Premiers talk tough over cuts: Billions lost for child care\\", Montreal Gazette, 25 February 2006, A4; Nicholas Read, \\"Stay-at- home parents will be the biggest beneficiaries of the new federal plan\\", Vancouver Sun, 3 May 2006, A4. Unlike some within the NDP, Doer is personally opposed to the decriminalization of marijuana, which he has said could result in economic difficulties with the United States.\\"Premier no fan of pot motion\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 February 2007, A4. As premier, Doer encouraged several Manitoba crown corporations to donate money to the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg; Manitoba Public Insurance, Manitoba Hydro, Manitoba Lotteries Corporation and the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission subsequently made donations of one million dollars each. Opposition leader Hugh McFadyen and some journalists questioned Doer's involvement in the matter, arguing that he was effectively directing the corporations to make these donations.Tamara King, \\"Doer government grilled on Crown donations to Canadian Museum for Human Rights\\", Canadian Press, 28 April 2008, 6:52pm; Daniel Lett, \\"Do you think donations pass the \`smell test'?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 April 2008, A3. =Education= Doer's government cut university tuition by 10% during its first term, and later provided universities with a property tax exemption.Helen Fallding, \\"NDP will try to minimize budget pain\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 January 2002, A9. It also amalgamated several school divisions prior to the 2002 municipal elections,Nick Martin, \\"New divisions not drawn up, Doer gov't says\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 July 2000, A6. and began to phase out education property taxes in the same period.Helen Fallding, \\"Education tax phase-out in spring likely\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 October 2001, A3. In 2006, the Doer government introduced a proposal for Manitoba university graduates to receive a tuition rebate of up to 60% if they chose to stay and work in the province after graduation.Paul Samyn, \\"Major tuition rebate in works\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 November 2006, A7; Mia Rabson, \\"Tuition rebates will be as high as 60 per cent\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 November 2006, A7. A 2008 Winnipeg Free Press article indicated that Manitoba and Alberta were investing more money in public education per student than all other provinces of Canada. Teachers' wages in Manitoba were also noted to be healthy in relation to the average national wage.Nicholas Hurst, \\"Education spending works for Doer's NDP\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 31 July 2008, A11. =Agriculture= Shortly after being sworn in as premier, Doer led an all- party delegation to Ottawa to seek a $1.3 billion financial bailout for western farmers to help mitigate an economic downturn in the sector. He was joined by Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow, Progressive Conservative MLA Larry Maguire, and Manitoba Liberal leader Jon Gerrard.David Kuxhaus, \\"Prairie politicians band together to plead farmers' case\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 October 1999, A3; Paul Adams, \\"Romanow, Doer want $1.3-billion in farm aid\\", Globe and Mail, 28 October 1999, A8. The federal government introduced $170 million in funding shortly thereafter, a figure that Doer and Romanow described as \\"heartless\\".Valerie Lawton, \\"Farmers get $170 million more in aid\\", Toronto Star, 5 November 1999, 1; Mathew Ingram, \\"Farm bailouts are no real answer\\", Globe and Mail, 5 November 1999, B2. In February 2000, Romanow and Doer stood with Chrétien to announce their support for a compromise bailout of $400 million.Brian Laghi and David Roberts, \\"One-time cash payout to help prairie farmers with spring crop\\", Globe and Mail, 25 February 2000, A4; Paul Samyn, \\"Help on way for cash-poor grain farmers\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 February 2000, A3. Doer called for an additional $500 million bailout for grain and oilseed farmers in 2001. See Helen Fallding, \\"Doer finds little support for farm aid\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 June 2001, A3. In 2002, Doer joined with Lorne Calvert, Romanow's successor as Premier of Saskatchewan, to call for the federal government to oppose an American farm subsidy bill that threatened the ability of Canadian farmers to access the American market. See Paul Samyn, \\"Provinces unite to fightfarm bill\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 May 2002, A13; Mia Rabson, \\"Leaders to discuss U.S. farm subsidies\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 May 2002, A3; David Kuxhaus, \\"Wowchuk warns farm bill designed to reap U.S. votes\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 May 2002, A5. He criticized another federal farm bailout plan later in the year, arguing that it put too much economic pressure on the provincial governments. See Paul Samyn, \\"\`It's half a loaf'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 June 2002, B1. Shortly after his re-election in 2003, Doer criticized the federal government for failing to respond to an agriculture crisis caused by the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in a Canadian cow and the subsequent closure of the American border to beef products produced in Canada.Daniel Lett, \\"Liberals fiddling while economy dives: Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 June 2003, A5. The federal and provincial governments subsequently agreed on a $50 million bailout to the industry.Daniel Lett, \\"Manitoba farmers to get $50M in aid\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 September 2003, A1. The border was reopened to live cattle in December 2004.Mia Rabson, \\"Border reopens to live cattle\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 December 2004, A1. Doer strongly supports the Canadian Wheat Board's policy of single-desk marketing, and has opposed efforts by some on the political right to weaken its status.Mia Rabson, \\"Doer issues challenge over wheat board\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 January 2006, A12. In late 2006, Doer accused federal Agriculture Minister Chuck Strahl of interfering in the Wheat Board's elections.Paul Samyn and Mia Rabson, \\"Doer, directors cast Strahl as a bully\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 November 2006, A10. In the same period, Doer and Saskatchewan Premier Lorne Calvert challenged the federal Conservative government to hold a national referendum on the Wheat Board's future. See Martin Cash, \\"Saskatchewan joins call for referendum\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 November 2006, A5. See also Larry Kusch, \\"More barley lawsuits likely, Tories told\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 March 2008, A4. The Doer government has rejected a return to single-desk hog marketing, which was eliminated during the years of the Filmon government.Helen Fallding, \\"Tempers flare over hog fracas\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 February 2001, A3. During its second term, the government supported plans to establish an OlyWest hog processing plant in northeast Winnipeg. This measure was extremely controversial among party members, and area NDP MLAs Daryl Reid and Bidhu Jha indicated that they opposed the measure. In response to criticism, Doer withdrew his support for OlyWest in 2007.Mia Rabson and Bartley Kives, \\"Doer puts nail in OlyWest's coffin\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 May 2007, A6. The Doer government introduced a temporary ban on new hog farms throughout most of the province in March 2008, following the release of a provincial environmental report.\\"Manitoba bans new hog farms\\", Calgary Herald, 4 March 2008, C1. Around the same time, Doer announced new funding for waste-water treatment plants that would allow two existing hog-processing plants to expand their operations.Matt Goerzen, \\"Waste-water treatment upgrades enable hog-plant expansions\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 March 2008, B9. Doer is a vocal opponent of the American Country of Origin Labelling initiative, which would require American producers to separate meat from hogs slaughtered in Canada and increase packing and labelling cost.\\"Manitoba premier promises farm group he'll lobby for them on US food labelling law\\", Canadian Press, 23 January 2008, 23:19; Larry Kusch, \\"U.S. food labelling could hurt hog farmers\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 January 2008, B6; Mia Rabson, \\"Doer confident hogs will flow\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 January 2008, A9. =Justice= Doer opposed the Chrétien government's decision to implement a federal gun registry, and his government joined with other provinces to raise a constitutional challenge against the law in 2000.\\"High noon at high court for gun law\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 February 2000, A1. Doer called for the federal government to strengthen its laws against child pornography in 2002, after the Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled that John Robin Sharpe's fictional writings involving children met the legal definition of \\"artistic merit\\".Erin Anderssen, \\"Ottawa urged to tighten porn laws\\", Globe and Mail, 28 March 2002, A4. Doer was quoted as saying, \\"We believe that the rights of children should be superior rights in our country to the rights of perverts\\".Helen Fallding, \\"Manitoba justice officials to study\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 March 2002, A3. The following year, the Manitoba government unveiled a website that included photographs and profiles of high-risk sex offenders.\\"Man. unveils Web site with photos, profiles of high-risk sex offenders\\", Canadian Press, 11 April 2003, 20:54. Also in 2002, Doer argued that persons who kill police officers should spend the rest of their natural lives in jail, without access to Canada's so-called \\"Faint Hope Clause\\" for early release.Mia Rabson, \\"Kill officer, go to jail for life, Doer urges\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 May 2002, A11. Three years later, he argued that the provisions of the federal Youth Criminal Justice Act were too lenient.\\"Doer says youth law puts public at risk\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 November 2005, A4. In the summer of 2001, Doer promised that his government would pass legislation to shut down outlaw gang clubhouses, if the federal government would not do the same. See David Kuxhaus, \\"Doer takes on gangs\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 June 2001, A1. The legislation was brought forward in November of the same year; Mia Rabson, \\"NDP cracks down on biker bunkers\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 November 2001, A1. In 2007, Doer led an all-party task force to Ottawa to seek greater federal penalties for gang-related crime, youth offences and car theft.Bartley Kives, \\"Top cops, politicians to press Ottawa for crackdown on crime\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 September 2007, A8. In 2004, the Doer government increased funding for the hiring of police officers and Crown prosecutors.\\"Manitoba Legislature acts on some promises\\", Globe and Mail, 10 December 2004, A9.

Doer's government tabled legislation in 2009 to provide civilian oversight of police officers in Manitoba, following an inquiry into the death of Crystal Taman. She was killed when her car, stopped for a red light, was struck by off-duty Winnipeg Police constable Derek Harvey-Zink's pickup truck. The Taman Inquiry's report strongly criticized the resulting police investigation into the collision, as well as the Doer Government's choice of special prosecutor, Marty Minuk.Bruce Owen, \\"Province's new police act would boost civilians' role\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 February 2009, A7; Bruce Owen, \\"Decades in the making: New police law has its roots in years of tragic history\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 April 2009, A6. =Environment= Doer has been a strong and consistent supporter of the Kyoto Accord on climate change.Helen Fallding, \\"Province reaffirms Kyoto accord support\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 February 2002, A14; Charlie Gillis, \\"Six Premiers, six agendas: Western conference\\", National Post, 4 June 2002, A4; Charlie Gillis, \\"Premiers warm to hearing Klein's Kyoto alternative\\", National Post, 6 June 2002, A5 [Gillis identified Doer as Klein's primary opponent]; Helen Fallding, \\"We'll beat Kyoto target, Doer vows\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 June 2002, A7; Gary Doer, \\"Canadians should embrace Kyoto vision\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 June 2002, A15.

He also called for an independent review of the Manitoba Clean Environment Commission in 2008, arguing that the renewal process for hydroelectric projects was too long.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Approval process frustrates premier\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 April 2008, A4. He added that any changes would protect the public's right to oppose and cross-examine energy projects. In November 2008, Doer announced that his government would ban new logging in provincial parks and phase out existing projects. He also announced a ban on plastic shopping bags, and on the use of cellphones while driving. Parents were also forbidden to smoke when children were in the car. The opposition Progressive Conservatives indicated that it would support all of these initiatives.Bruce Owen and Mary Agnes Welch, \\"NDP gets into the banning business - Measures will impact every Manitoban\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 November 2008, A5; \\"Manitoba introduces bill to limit cellphone use, smoking in cars\\", Canadian Press, 27 November 2008, 05:04pm. In late 2005, the American magazine Business Week listed Doer as one of the top twenty international leaders fighting climate change.Paul Samyn, \\"Magazine lauds Doer's green policies\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 December 2005, A3.In 2001, Doer appointed former federal cabinet minister Lloyd Axworthy to chair a task force on climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. See Helen Fallding, \\"Axworthy named to chair task force to develop blueprint for action\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 March 2001, A7; \\"A plan for the warm century\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 25 March 2001, B4; In late 2005, Doer and Quebec Premier Jean Charest co-authored a piece outlining strategies for reversing climate change. See Gary Doer and Jean Charest, \\"Seize the climate-friendly day\\", Globe and Mail, 7 December 2005, A27. =Aboriginal issues= In November 1999, Doer appointed a two-person panel to advise his government on implementing the findings of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry, which had been published eight years earlier.David Roberts, \\"Commission launched on 1991 native report\\", Globe and Mail, 30 November 1999, A5. Doer indicated that he was disappointed with the Filmon government's inaction on the file. See \\"Manitoba government establishes Aboriginal Justice Implementation Commission\\" [government press release], M2 Presswire, 30 November 1999. In April 2000, Manitoba took steps to provide indigenous Manitobans with their own child and family-service agencies.\\"Aboriginals to get own family services\\", Globe and Mail, 18 April 2000, A9. Doer convened a provincial summit on aboriginal commerce in November 2004.Daniel Lett, \\"Aboriginal business summit set\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 September 2004, B8. He indicated that the summit was intended to showcase successful businesses, and to forge greater links between the aboriginal and non-aboriginal communities.Martin Cash, \\"Summit to encourage more aboriginal-owned businesses\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 November 2004, C9; Martin Cash, \\"Aboriginal biz summit may deliver the goods\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 May 2005, A9. Doer is a strong supporter of the Kelowna Accord signed in late 2005 by the federal government of Paul Martin, provincial premiers and aboriginal leaders.Mia Rabson, \\"NDP ready to provide balance, says Layton\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 February 2006, A3. After the Martin government was defeated in the 2006 federal election and replaced by the government of Stephen Harper, Doer criticized Harper's failure to implement the accord.Alexander Panetta, \\"Critics slam Tory budget over lack of support for natives, Kyoto\\", Canadian Press, 2 May 2006, 18:40; Paul Samyn, \\"Natives outraged Angered at apparent end to $5.1-B Kelowna accord\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 May 2006, A11; Ian Urquhart, \\"Premiers pressure Harper on native deal\\", Toronto Star, 30 May 2006, A4. In late 2008, the Doer government introduced legislation to give sixteen bands on the east shore of Lake Winnipeg greater authority over the management of their traditional lands. The bill requires that plans for development be approved by both the province and the band's chief, and extends the range of influence well beyond the area's small reserves.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Bands get east-side planning authority - Bill paves way for world heritage site\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 December 2008, A6. Some chiefs in the affected area later objected to the bill on procedural grounds, arguing that they were not properly consulted.Bruce Owen, \\"First Nations threaten to snub bill\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 June 2009, A4. Following consultations with the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs in 1999, the Doer government established a selection committee to oversee proposals for setting up casinos in Manitoba first nations.Daniel Lett, \\"Play fair on native casinos, NDP told\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 June 2000, A1. The process subsequently became stalled, and only one of the casinos was up and running by 2003. The government subsequently appointed a panel to review the situation and recommend a change in strategy;Daniel Lett, \\"NDP to overhaul native casino plan\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 November 2002, A5; Daniel Lett, \\"NDP, chiefs join forces to look at casinos\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 December 2002, A3; Daniel Lett, \\"Nominees for native casino panel confirmed\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 January 2003, A6; \\"NDP gives free rein to casino review\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 April 2003, B1. the panel argued that the province should consider creating one large casino, instead of several small on-reserve casinos.Daniel Lett, \\"Report bets on one large native-run casino\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 September 2003, A1. A second casino was opened in 2005, while the larger issue remained unresolved as of 2007.Daniel Lett, \\"Confusion in the NDP's native casino file\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 August 2007, A6. =Energy= Doer has often referred to hydroelectric power as playing a major role in Manitoba's long-term economic strategy,Mia Rabson, \\"Manitoba's political parties are revving up for a close election\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 January 2007, A11; Mia Rabson, \\"Black gold on tap\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 February 2007, A6. and has advocated a national east-west power grid to export Manitoba's plentiful hydroelectric power to Ontario and other provinces in Western Canada.Helen Fallding, \\"Doer pushes power grid to link West\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 31 May 2001, A3; Paul Samyn, \\"Manitoba to study grid of electrical transmission\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 June 2001, B4; John Spears, \\"Hydro One considers Manitoba power line\\", Toronto Star, 19 November 2004, D3; Leah Janzen, \\"Doer excited by potential for lucrative power sales\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 February 2005, A1. Ontario announced its support for an east-west grid in 2007. See Mia Rabson, \\"Premier's power grid dream gets energized\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 31 January 2007, A6. In August 2002, Manitoba Hydro signed a $1.7 billion deal with its largest American consumer. See David Kuxhaus, \\"$1.7-B Hydro deal\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 August 2002, A1. Doer announced Manitoba's first wind farm project in November 2004, near the community of St. Leon. This was a private-public partnership arranged between Manitoba Hydro and AirSource Power Fund.Helen Fallding, \\"Province launches first wind farm in private-public deal\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 November 2004, A5. It was officially started in April 2005.Mia Rabson, \\"Wind farm generating excitement\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 April 2005, A1. In September 2007, Manitoba Hydro indicated that it would construct a new transmission line to connect north and south Manitoba on the west side of Lake Winnipeg. Hydro's initial plan had been to construct the line on the east side, but Doer's government rejected this approach, arguing that it would damage pristine boreal forest territories. The local aboriginal community is divided on the issue, with some leaders supporting the government's conservation approach and others arguing that east side construction would help combat poverty in the area.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"East side, west side\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 March 2008, B1. The Progressive Conservative Party has strongly criticized Doer's decision.Mia Rabson, \\"West side story for Manitoba Hydro\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 September 2007, A1; Mia Rabson, \\"International pressure part of decision: Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 September 2007, A6.

See also Madelaine Drohan, \\"The long arm of the U.S.\\", Globe and Mail (Breaking News), 22 February 2008. In April 2008, Manitoba Hydro announced a $2 billion agreement to sell surplus energy to Wisconsin once the construction is complete.Tamara King, \\"Manitoba inks $2-billion electricity deal with Wisconsin\\", Canadian Press, 17 April 2008, 2:54p; Daniel Lett, \\"Doer multiplies the stakes in Hydro battle with Tories\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 April 2008, A4. Doer asked Manitoba Hydro and the Manitoba Public Utilities Board to provide an analysis of natural gas prices in July 2008, with the intent of limiting price increases during the winter. He also indicated that his government would intervene to protect consumers from high prices.Mia Rabson, \\"Doer dumps on huge gas hike\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 July 2008, A1. Finance Minister Greg Selinger later indicated that the government would provide some relief for consumers, but would not use Manitoba Hydro's profits to offset rate increases.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Doer promises gas pain relief\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 July 2008, A1. =Labour issues= The Doer government introduced a number of labour reforms early in its first mandate, making it easier for unions to obtain certification and giving employees increased powers to move disputes to binding arbitration. Business leaders opposed the changes, though Doer argued that the bill was far less contentious than opponents made it out to be.David Kuxhaus, \\"Premier tries to placate business riled by contentious labour law changes\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 August 2000, A1; David Kuxhaus, \\"Voters seem satisfied with Doer government\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 October 2000, A4. In 2004, Doer rejected a call by party members to introduce legislation that would ban replacement workers in labour disputes.\\"Premier won't ban replacement workers\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 March 2004, A5. Doer's government increased Manitoba's minimum wage from $6.00 to $6.25 in November 2000, and brought in subsequent increases of 25 cents on an annual basis.\\"Manitoba bumps up minimum wage in the province by 25 cents an hour\\", Canadian Press, 29 November 2000, 20:55; \\"Survival above all\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 29 December 2001, A14. By April 2005, the minimum wage had been increased to $7.25. Some argued that this was still short of a living wage.Dennis Howlett, \\"The call for a living wage: activists fighting for fair wages across the country\\", Canadian Dimension, 1 May 2005, p. 25. The minimum wage was increased to $8.50 in 2008.\\"What is the minimum wage?\\", Government of Manitoba, accessed 12 December 2007. In 2005, the Doer government introduced a bill to expand provincial workers' compensation coverage.Paul Egan, \\"Compensation plan to cover all workers\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 April 2005, A1. The Doer government announced in late 2007 that temporary foreign workers and modeling agencies would be included under the Employment Standards Act, to prevent worker exploitation.\\"Legislation to Protect Models and Foreign Workers\\" , Manitoba Federation of Labour, 21 November 2007. =Science and infrastructure= =Monsanto= In 1999, the Manitoba government under NDP leadership, began its ongoing relationship with Monsanto, accepting a 12.5 million dollar agreement to bring in its first development centre.Manitoba Government Press release, 10 March 1999. In 2005, Gary Doer announced a deal to allow Monsanto to build their 42,000 square foot Canadian head office in Manitoba.\\"Government of Manitoba Press Release\\", \\"Smartpark constructing 7th building at U of M - Set to become new head office for Monsanto in Canada\\" Doer's government introduced a biotechnology training strategy in October 2002, to address a skilled-worker shortage in the industry.Helen Fallding, \\"NDP to boost biotech training\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 October 2002, A16. In early 2003, Doer signed a $160 million deal with the federal government for expansion work on the Red River Floodway. The floodway expansion was described as the largest infrastructure project in Manitoba history,Paul Samyn, \\"Our 'polite' premier gets extra $20M\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 April 2003, A3; Daniel Lett, \\"Floodway deal sealed\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 April 2003, A3. and was started in late 2005.Helen Fallding, \\"Doubling Duff's Ditch\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 August 2005, B1; Mia Rabson, \\"Sod turned for $665-M expansion ..Roblin hailed for vision, perseveramce\\" , Winnipeg Free Press, 24 September 2005, B1. Doer took part in discussions in 2007-08 with media mogul David Asper and officials from other levels of government, regarding the location of a new stadium for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers football team. He was skeptical about Asper's initial plan for a stadium in the Polo Park region of Winnipeg, and was more supportive of an abortive plan to construct the stadium in the economically depressed area of Point Douglas.Daniel Lett, \\"Stadium proposal depends on mayor\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 June 2008, A1; Bruce Owen, \\"U of M stadium the last option?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 August 2008, A11. Asper eventually chose site in Fort Garry, next to the University of Manitoba.\\"Manitoba premier says Canwest's Asper has discussions about new football stadium\\", Canadian Press, 14 August 2008, 10:32pm; Bartley Kives, \\"Stadium finds home at U of M\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 September 2008, A3. The deal was finalized in early 2009, with the province providing $20 million in funding; provincial officials believe that all but $1 million will be recovered before the stadium opens in 2011.Bartley Kives, \\"Bombers finally getting a new home\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 April 2009. In September 2008, Doer and Winnipeg Mayor Sam Katz announced $138 million for a rapid transit plan that will eventually link downtown Winnipeg with the University of Manitoba.Bartley Kives, \\"Bus corridor plan rolled out - $138-M first section to run from downtown to Jubilee\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 September 2008, B1; Bartley Kives, \\"City eyes $90-million loan to finance bus corridor - rapid transit\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 October 2008, B2. In the same month, Doer designated a piece of land in northwest Winnipeg as the site of a future inland port.\\"Manitoba designates land in Winnipeg as proposed location of inland port\\", Canadian Press, 10 September 2008, 9:19pm; Bruce Owen, \\"Work on Bombers' new digs may start next year\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 December 2008, B3. The area was given the name CentrePort Canada, and its first directors were chosen in December 2008.\\"Manitoba's inland port announces its first board of directors\\", eSource Canada Business News Network, 29 December 2008; See also \\"Harper pledges cash for Manitoba inland port\\", CanWest News Service, 14 April 2009. Doer announced in February 2009 that his government would spend $1 million on special training for northern Manitoba workers, following a global economic downtown that adversely affected the province's forestry and mining sectors.Bruce Owen, \\"1-M fund to help North through slump\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 February 2009, A4. Two months later, he joined with the federal government to announce a $40 million investment in a cold weather aerospace engine testing and research facility in Thompson.Martin Cash, \\"Test centre for Thompson\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 April 2009, B5; Martin Cash, \\"Engine test site crucial: experts - Thompson is perfect due to its cold weather\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 April 2009, B8. In early May 2009, the federal and provincial governments announced $116 million for infrastructure renewal in rural and northern communities.Larry Kusch, \\"Rural Manitoba gets $116M to build with\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 May 2009, A4. =Crocus Investment Fund= In early 2005, the labour-managed Crocus Investment Fund stopped trading and entered into financial protection. The Doer government was subsequently accused of having ignored signs of trouble at the fund, and of failing to protect the interests of investors.Paul Egan, \\"Auditor to slam Crocus\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 May 2005, A1. The opposition Progressive Conservatives argued that the government had neglected warnings of financial impropriety, in part because of ideological links between the New Democratic Party and the labour movement. Doer rejected this charge, observing that the fund had been established by the Filmon government in conjunction with labour leaders.Mia Rabson, \\"Tories, NDP trade barbs over being cosy with Crocus\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 June 2005, A11. Both parties were affected by the controversy in 2005. See \\"Doer trips, Murray falls\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 28 June 2005, A12. He also rejected calls from the opposition for a formal inquiry,Paul Egan, \\"Crocus investors sue for $200M\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 July 2005, A1; Martin Cash, \\"PCs announce Crocus team, remove legislative logjam\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 May 2006, A3. and insisted that the province did nothing wrong in the matter.Martin Cash, \\"No Crocus error, premier maintains\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 May 2006, A10. =Federal- provincial relations= Doer supported the Chrétien government's Clarity Act legislation, which required that any future negotiations on provincial secession be preceded by a referendum with a clearly defined question. The act was opposed by Quebec nationalists, who regarded it as an infringement on their national sovereignty. In 2004, Doer criticized new Prime Minister Paul Martin for seeming to undermine the principles of the bill.Joan Bryden, \\"PM's failure to defend Dion, Clarity from attacks imperil Western gains: Doer\\", Canadian Press, 15 February 2004, 15:40; \\"Martin too wishy-washy on Quebec, says Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 February 2004, B1. He also criticized Martin's promise to remove the \\"Notwithstanding Clause\\" from the Constitution of Canada in the 2006 federal election.Kevin Rollason, \\"Doer won't support scrapping clause\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 January 2006, A12. Doer later criticized Martin's successor, Stephen Harper, for recognizing the Québécois as a nation within Canada in late 2006. He was quoted as saying, \\"[t]o me, Canada is one nation, one country. I understand Quebec is unique in terms of language, culture and law, but Canada is one country.\\"Paul Samyn, \\"'Nation' talk irks Manitobans\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 November 2006, A4. Notwithstanding this and other criticisms, a May 2008 article in The Globe and Mail newspaper described Doer as one of the few premiers to have a good working relationship with Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.Steven Chase, \\"PM's sunny relationship with Premier signals change in political landscape\\", Globe and Mail, 2 May 2008, S3. Manitoba signed on to the federal government's Building Canada Fund in late 2008, receiving about $500 million in new infrastructure monies.Mia Rabson, \\"Ottawa funnels $500 M to Manitoba\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 September 2008, A4. Following a global economic downturn in late 2008, Doer called on the federal government to invest in job creation and infrastructure funding.Erin Anderssen, \\"Manitoba Premier urges Ottawa to confront recession with job creation\\", Globe and Mail, 20 October 2008, A4. Prime Minister Harper later said that his government would spend more on roads, bridges and other public works.Brian Laghi, Steven Chase & Rheal Seguin, \\"PM, provinces agree to spend to stimulate ailing economy\\", Globe and Mail, 11 November 2008, A1. According to journalist Chantal Hébert, Doer played a vital role in convincing other provincial leaders to accept Quebec Premier Jean Charest's plan to create the Council of the Federation in 2003.Chantal Hébert, \\"Charest's coup at Charlottetown\\", Toronto Star, 14 July 2003, A17. In 2008-09, Charest and Doer helped broker an agreement among the premiers to provide for greater labour mobility within Canada.Andy Blatchford, \\"Canadian premiers reach agreement to ease labour mobility across provinces\\", Canadian Press, 17 July 2008, 4:49pm; Steven Chase, \\"Labour-mobility deal fails to quell skeptics\\", Globe and Mail, 16 January 2009 (breaking news). In early 2007, Doer said that Manitoba would not enter a free trade deal signed between Alberta and British Columbia. He instead called for a national trade accord.Mia Rabson, \\"Doer favours national trade accord\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 February 2007, B2. Doer met with other western Canadian premiers in June 2009 to introduce a plan for the collective purchase of prescription drugs. The premiers indicated that the plan could save taxpayers millions of dollars.Jonathan Fowlie, \\"Joint drug-buying pact considered\\", Vancouver Sun, 19 June 2009, A8. In late 2008, the federal Liberal and New Democratic parties announced plans to defeat the Conservatives on a motion of no confidence and create a coalition government. The plan was ultimately unsuccessful, and the Conservatives remained in power. Doer did not take a position on the coalition, and instead called for all parties in the House of Commons of Canada to work in a cooperative manner.Jennifer Graham, \\"Premiers urge federal politicians to work together in best interest of Canada\\", Canadian Press, 1 December 2008, 7:34pm; Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Taking a position pointless, says Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 December 2008, A5. =International relations= Since his first election in 1999, Doer has been a leading opponent of a water diversion in Devils Lake, North Dakota that many regard as posing a serious environmental threat to Manitoba.Paul Samyn, \\"Doer taking diversion fight to Washington\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 October 1999, A8; \\"Doer, Lathlin to lead delegation opposing Devil's Lake drainage outlet\\" [government press release], M2 Presswire, 22 October 1999; \\"Diversion struggle is uphill, Doer says\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 27 October 1999, A3; Paul Samyn, \\"Lobby effort scuttles N.D. diversion\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 November 1999, A3; \\"Doer rallies troops to fight Devils Lake diversion plans\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 November 1999, A3; James Brooke, \\"Manitoba, Awash in Its Own Water, Shuns North Dakota's\\", New York Times, 6 December 1999, p. 8; Douglas Nairne, \\"Province enlists lawyer to battle N.D.\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 January 2000, A4; Douglas Nairne, \\"In this corner, Doer and Ventura\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 January 2000, A3; Ruth Walker, \\"A rising Devils Lake is causing a flood of concerns\\", Christian Science Monitor, 6 March 2000, p. 7; Aldo Santin, \\"Politics stalling Devils Lake diversion funds\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 March 2000, A2; David Roberts, \\"Doer, governor weigh impact of diversion on Lake Winnipeg\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 April 2000, A7; \\"Doer travelling again to fight diversion plan\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 May 2000, A4; David Kuxhaus, \\"Devils Lake project still a threat: Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 September 2000, A8; David Kuxhaus, \\"Would make it easier to build Devils Lake drainage outlet\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 22 January 2001, A7; Paul Samyn, \\"'Aggressive' fight needed to protect water: Doer to PM\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 March 2001, A3; \\"Doer aims to fight water diversion\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 August 2001, A4; \\"Manitoba leaders team up to fight N.D. water plans\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 12 October 2001, B3; \\"Premier, Tory chief fight N.D. diversions in D.C.\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 July 2002, A15; \\"Powell rams through N.D. pipeline\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 April 2002, A15; \\"Devils Lake report delay thrills Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 August 2002, A11; Daniel Lett, \\"NDP takes diversion fight to U.S. court\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 October 2002, A3; Scott Edmonds, \\"Manitoba views new U.S. plan for flooded Devils Lake as mixed blessing\\", Canadian Press, 26 February 2003, 16:56; Mia Rabson, \\"Dike fight tactics denounced by Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 March 2004, A3; Paul Egan, \\"Minnesota jumps into water fight Joins Manitoba in dispute with N.D. over diversion plan for Devils Lake\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 April 2004, A5; Paul Samyn, \\"Doer targets Devils Lake\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 November 2004, A1; Helen Fallding, \\"Devils Lake outlet nearly finished\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 January 2005, A1; Paul Samyn, \\"Doer to lead Capitol Hill blitz\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 April 2005, A8; Paul Samyn, \\"Devils Lake outlet unstoppable, officials fear\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 April 2005, A3; Paul Samyn, \\"Tough talk on Devils Lake Doer threatens U.S. with lawsuit\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 April 2005, A1; Chris Wattie, \\"U.S. senators reject 'Devils' compromise\\", National Post, 28 April 2005, A11; \\"Doer recruiting Great Lakes governors for Devils Lake fight\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 May 2005, A5; Mike DeSouza, \\"Great Lakes mayors unite against water diversion\\", National Post, 27 May 2005, A4; Paul Samyn, \\"Devils Lake 'attention' promised; Bush tells PM he's aware of diversion\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 June 2005, A12; Paul Samyn, \\"Doer gets ear of ambassador\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 July 2005, A7; Mia Rabson, \\"Doer set to retaliate over Devils Lake outlet\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 June 2007, A1.

He had previously traveled to Washington, D.C. in a bid to put the project on hold. See \\"Doer heads to Washington to press beef farmers' case\\", Globe and Mail, 7 April 2004, A7. In 2005, the Canadian and American governments reached a non-binding compromise deal on the project that committed both sides to design an advanced filter to prevent environmental disruption.Paul Samyn, \\"Devils Lake deal is done\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 August 2005, A1; Alan Freeman, \\"Devils Lake agreement non-binding, McKenna says\\", Globe and Mail, 9 August 2005, A4.

In May 2008, Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko made an official visit to Manitoba and addressed the provincial legislature.Steve Lambert, \\"Warm welcome for Ukrainian president at Manitoba legislature\\", Canadian Press, 27 May 2008, 4:43pm. Doer signed an agreement with the American state of Georgia in 2004, for increased co-operation between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the National Virology Lab in Winnipeg.Mia Rabson, \\"Doer signs deal to boost city's bid for super lab\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 February 2004, A5. In the same year, he signed a memorandum of understanding with Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty to create a \\"biomedical corridor\\" for the promotion of research, capital investment and technology development.Martin Cash, \\"Biomedical alliance with Minnesota mapped out\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 June 2004, C8. In early 2005, Doer and New Brunswick Premier Bernard Lord traveled on a trade mission to Texas in what was described as an effort to improve relations between Canada and the United States.Paul Samyn, \\"Doer, Lord are a rootin' tootin' tag team in Texas\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 January 2005, A1; Paul Samyn, \\"Texas science labs spark Doer's hopes for trade\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 January 2005, A6.

In June 2009, Doer took part in discussions to create a \\"Western Energy Corridor\\" to allow an easier flow of both renewable energy and fossil fuels among western American states and Canadian provinces.Jason Fekete\\", \\"Canada-U.S. energy corridor idea promoted\\", Victoria Times Colonist, 15 June 2009, A8. Doer has supported Canada's military mission in Afghanistan, despite skepticism about the purpose of the mission from the federal NDP.Mia Rabson, \\"Manitoba backs Canada's military\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 October 2001, 13; \\"NDP group withdraws provocative preamble\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 September 2006, A9; \\"Manitoba's army\\" [editorial], Winnipeg Free Press, 7 February 2008, A10. He called for Canada to ban donations to Hezbollah's charity wing in 2002,Daniel Lett, \\"Stop militants from fund-raising: Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 9 November 2002, A20. and endorsed Jean Chrétien government's decision to remain out of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.Judy Monchuk, \\"Klein sends kudos, thanks to ambassador for U.S. war on Iraq\\", Canadian Press, 21 March 2003, 19:24. In 2005, Doer spoke against the American government's plans to require passports at Canada–US border crossings. He argued that the new expense of travel would create a \\"financial Berlin Wall\\" for some families, and instead proposed a security protocol centred around drivers' licenses.Mia Rabson, \\"Passport law will create a 'Berlin Wall'\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 February 2007, A5. In 2007, North Dakota Governor John Hoeven announced that he was working with Doer to find an alternative approach.\\"Hoeven says he's working with Manitoba on visa alternative\\", Associated Press Newswires, 13 September 2007, 11:03 report. In 2008, Doer argued that Canada should \\"aggressively\\" defend the North American Free Trade Agreement against criticism from American Democratic Party presidential candidates.Mia Rabson, \\"Democrats' NAFTA slap unwise: Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 April 2008, A8. He later spoke against the United States Congress's planned \\"Buy American\\" legislation during a business trip to Illinois and Texas.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Doer to target protectionism on U.S. trip\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 31 January 2009, A3; \\"Trade, Investment Focus of Western Premiers' Mission to U.S.\\", PR Newswire (US), 2 February 2009, 04:24 pm; Campbell Clark, \\"Obama moves to water down 'Buy American' provisions\\", Globe and Mail, 4 February 2009, A1.

Depasupil, \\"RP, Canada sign 3rd labor export agreement: At least 10,000 job opportunities await OFWs in Manitoba this year\\", Manila Times, 9 February 2008.

Speakers had previously been appointed by the premier.Scott Edmonds, \\"Inuit MLA first elected Speaker in Manitoba\\", Globe and Mail, 19 November 1999, A27. The Doer government announced election spending reforms in June 2000, which were highlighted by a ban on political donations by private corporations and organized labour.David Roberts, \\"Manitoba to restrict donations\\", Globe and Mail, 21 June 2000, A5; Graham Fraser, \\"Restrictions on donations can see politics transformed\\", Toronto Star, 25 June 2000, p. 1. This measure was opposed by the opposition Progressive Conservatives, and by the right-wing Canadian Taxpayers Federation.David Kuxhaus, \\"NDP's planned election-ad limit violates charter: taxpayers' group\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 23 July 2000, A3. The reforms came into effect in 2001,David Kuxhaus, \\"Parties get set to rebuild war chests\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 June 2001, A11; Jeffrey Simpson, \\"Why Manitoba should be an inspiration to us all\\", Globe and Mail, 31 May 2002, A21. and were extended to party leadership contests in June 2002.Mia Rabson, \\"NDP to slap donation limits on leadership campaigns\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 28 June 2002, A10. Further restrictions were added in 2006.Mia Rabson, \\"Law will squeeze party fundraising\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 April 2006, A5. In June 2009, Winnipeg Mayor Sam Katz spoke against Doer's plan to ban union and corporate donations from municipal elections.Bartley Kives and Bruce Owen, \\"'Slap in the face to city council' Katz slams NDP's proposed donations ban\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 June 2009, B1. The Doer government introduced legislation in April 2006 to prevent MLAs from crossing the floor from one party to another. Under the terms of this legislation, MLAs who choose to leave their political party are required to sit as independents until the next election, or to resign and seek re-election for another party.Mia Rabson, \\"Doer wants to end MLAs crossing floor\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 April 2006, A1. Doer announced plans in early 2008 to create a lobbyist registry for Manitoba,Bruce Owen and Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Manitoba government announces it will introduce a lobbyist registry\\", Canadian Press, 28 April 2008, 10:17pm. as well as introducing fixed election dates, partial public campaign financing, and restrictions on partisan direct mail flyers sent out by MLAs at public expense.\\"Manitoba proposes fixed election dates, partial public campaign financing\\", Canadian Press, 30 April 2008, 4:41pm; Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Tories assail new election laws\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 May 2008, A9. The plan for public campaign financing was later abandoned after public opposition.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"NDP, Tories won't take public subsidy - Election finance amendments planned\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 8 April 2009, A7. In 2009, opposition politicians and some journalists pressured Doer to call a public inquiry into a controversy involving expense claims from the 1999 provincial election. Elections Manitoba had determined that some reimbursement claims filed by the Manitoba NDP were unwarranted; in late 2003, the party agreed to repay $76,000 in an out-of- court settlement. Critics have charged a lack of transparency in the process, and have questioned why Elections Manitoba did not lay charges. At least one Winnipeg journalist has compared the matter with an expenses scandal faced by the Conservative Party of Canada following the 2006 federal election. Doer has argued that the matter is settled, and that there is no need for an inquiry.Dan Lett, \\"Elections watchdog should cough up truth\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 June 2009, A5. =Popularity= Doer's government enjoyed an extended honeymoon with voters after the 1999 election. The NDP consistently led all other parties in public opinion polls from 1999 until 2005, often by wide margins.Davis Kuxhaus, \\"Voters seem satisfied with Doer government\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 2 October 2000, A4; Helen Fallding, \\"Grit support up as NDP, PCs struggle\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 December 2000, A3l; \\"NDP riding high\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 26 March 2001, A1; Aldo Santin, \\"Growing Liberal support hits 24%: NDP drops 5 per cent, but party still leads Tories\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 July 2001, A4; Helen Fallding, \\"Tories gaining, NDP slipping, survey shows\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 December 2001, A11 (the NDP still led this poll, 39% to 32%); Helen Fallding, \\"Doer?

The party's popularity dipped in late 2005, damaged somewhat by questions resulting from the failure of the Crocus Investment Fund. Polls taken in December 2005 and March 2006 showed the NDP and Progressive Conservatives tied for support.Mia Rabson, \\"Tories strong again: poll Same support level as governing NDP\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 March 2006, A5. In July 2006, the PCs pulled ahead of the NDP for the first time in seven years.Daniel Lett, \\"Support for Tories surging\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 July 2006, A1. The NDP nevertheless recovered to win a convincing majority in the 2007 election, and in July 2008 held a ten-point lead over the Progressive Conservatives in popular support.Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Political landscape as flat as the prairie\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 July 2008, A4. The PCs posted a surprise lead over the NDP in a December 2008 poll, although some local journalists questioned its accuracy.Dan Lett, \\"Manitoba Tories stuck in neutral if Doer stays put\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 December 2008, A4; \\"Editorial - An unhealthy split\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 December 2008, A10. By April 2009, the NDP once again held a ten-point lead.Lindsey Wiebe, \\"NDP regains big lead over Tories\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 April 2009, A5. Doer was rated as Canada's most popular premier in polls taken in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, scoring a 77% rating in March 2006.Paul Samyn, \\"Doer must be doing it right\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 September 2003, A1; Paul Samyn, \\"But Doer still Canada's most well-liked politician\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 November 2004, A1; Paul Samyn, \\"Doer nation's most popular premier: poll\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 April 2005, A1; Paul Samyn, \\"How premiers rate\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 March 2006, A3. His approval rating was 81% in March 2008, making him the second most popular Canadian premier after Danny Williams of Newfoundland and Labrador.Mia Rabson, \\"Canadians' confidence in economy tumbling\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 19 March 2008, A4. =Retirement= US President Barack Obama in 2009 On August 27, 2009 Doer announced he would not seek re-election in the 2011 election, and on August 28, 2009 he was nominated by Prime Minister Stephen Harper to succeed Michael Wilson as Canadian ambassador to the United States. He was formally sworn into that position on October 19, 2009, and on the same day Greg Selinger was sworn in as his replacement as Premier of Manitoba. Doer's former constituency assistant Matt Wiebe subsequently won the by-election to succeed Doer as MLA for Concordia on March 2, 2010.\\"Wiebe wins Concordia for NDP\\". cbc.ca, March 2, 2010. Federal politics Doer supported a bid to draft former Manitoba Premier Edward Schreyer as a candidate in the federal New Democratic Party's 1989 leadership contest.Geoffrey York, \\"Manitoba MLAS want Schreyer to run for federal NDP leadership\\", Globe and Mail, 18 May 1989, A18. When Schreyer declined to run, Doer tried to convince Stephen Lewis and then Bob Rae to enter the contest, without success.Graham Fraser, \\"Riis promises to support reluctant Lewis\\", Globe and Mail, 23 June 1989, A5; William Walker, \\"Rae ready to jump into NDP race\\", Toronto Star, 4 October 1989, A1. He eventually supported Audrey McLaughlin, who was elected on the fourth ballot of the party's leadership convention.\\"Most of party's big names supported McLaughlin\\", Toronto Star, 3 December 1989, A13. Doer with NDP leader Jack Layton during the 2008 federal election.There was speculation that Doer would seek the federal NDP leadership in 1995, after McLaughlin announced her resignation.\\"NDP leadership\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 May 1995, A3. He declined, and instead gave his support to longtime friend Alexa McDonough, whom he nominated at the leadership convention.David Roberts, \\"Nystrom well- placed to be NDP leader\\", Globe and Mail, 12 October 1995, A1; Dan Lett, \\"Alexa Reaches Out\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 May 1997, B1; Paul Samyn, \\"NDP Leader McDonough stepping down\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 6 June 2002, A1. McDonough was chosen as party leader following the first ballot. Doer opposed the New Politics Initiative in 2001.Paul Samyn, \\"Radicals left on the fringe of NDP\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 November 2001, A4. In 2002, he supported the leadership campaign of Bill Blaikie, whose federal Winnipeg—Transcona riding overlapped with his own provincial division.Paul Samyn, \\"Blaikie revs up campaign\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 June 2002, A8; David Kuxhaus, \\"Power matters, says Blaikie\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 June 2002, A5; Mia Rabson, \\"Blaikie strongly backed by Doer\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 January 2003, A5. Blaikie finished second against Jack Layton. Doer has disagreed with the federal NDP on some issues. He defended CanWest Global's takeover of a part of Conrad Black's newspaper empire in 2000, even though the arrangement had been criticized by the federal party.\\"Doer bashes federal NDP for its knock on news deal\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 August 2000, A4. He later called for Svend Robinson to be demoted as Foreign Affairs Critic in 2002, after Robinson announced his support for the Palestinians in their conflict with Israel (official NDP policy was that both sides should seek a peace agreement). Doer was quoted as saying, \\"Either he represents the party as a foreign affairs critic or he's removed as foreign affairs critic. And I believe he should be removed\\".Michael Friscolanti, \\"Demote Robinson, NDPers demand\\", National Post, 18 April 2002, A1; Bruce Cheadle, \\"Robinson continues to speak out after NDP removes him as critic on Mideast\\", Canadian Press, 18 April 2002, 13:00. He later expressed disappointment that Robinson was allowed to keep his critic's role, albeit with a ban against speaking on Middle East issues.Jane Taber and Michael Friscolanti, \\"Robinson censure called 'half measure': Not to speak on Mideast\\", National Post, 19 April 2002, A13. Doer published a ten-point proposal for the future of the federal NDP in June 2002, calling for a focus on health and education as well as fiscal balance, community safety and election finance reform.Gary Doer, \\"What NDP should stand for\\", Globe and Mail, 18 June 2002, A15. Ideology Doer is on the centrist wing of the New Democratic Party.Frances Russell, \\"Doer's abundance of caution\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 November 2001, A12; Allen Mills, \\"'President Doer' getting free ride as provincial politics whither away\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 3 November 2005, A14. He once described his political ideology as follows: Doer endorsed Tony Blair's approach to leading the British Labour Party in 1997,Dan Lett, \\"Doer closes in on the do-it stage\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 November 1997, A4. and his own 1999 election platform was frequently compared with Blair's \\"Third Way\\" of social democracy.\\"NDP redraws image for voters\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 December 1998, A11. Doer has also been compared with former Premier of Saskatchewan Roy Romanow, who also governed from the centrist wing of the party. Former NDP MLA Cy Gonick wrote a critical essay about Doer in 2007, describing him as a \\"small-l liberal\\" without \\"a socialist bone in his body\\".Cy Gonick, \\"Gary Doer's Manitoba\\", Canadian Dimension, July/August 2007, accessed 1 September 2007. Legacy Manitoba Wildlands director, Gaile Whelan Enns, said \\"He has no real policy legacy.\\" Eric Reder, Manitoba campaign director for the non-profit Wilderness Committee, echoed that assessment. \\" \\"The entirety of his term was incremental—little decisions,\\" Reder said.\\"Our Tar Sands Man in Ottawa,\\" The Manitoba government's relationship with Monsanto lead to the documentary \\"Seeds of Change,\\" which explored negative aspects of the relationship.Canadian Dimension, \\"Seeds of Change Documentary\\" https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/monsanto- lawyers-lies-and-videotape-seeds-of-censorship-sown-at-university- Fracking for oil increased dramatically under Doer.\\"Manitoba Petroleum\\", http://www.manitoba.ca/iem/petroleum/wwar/index.html Electoral record All electoral information is taken from Elections Manitoba.

Paul became involved in the Arian controversy which drew in the Emperor of the West, Constans, and his counterpart in the East, his brother Constantius II. Paul was installed and deposed three times from the See of Constantinople between 337 and 351. He was murdered by strangulation during his third and final exile in Cappadocia. His feast day is on November 6. Biography He was a native of Thessalonica, a presbyter of Constantinople, and secretary to the aged bishop Alexander of Constantinople, his predecessor in the see. Both the city and its inhabitants suffered much during the Arian controversies. No sooner had Alexander breathed his last than the Arian and Orthodox parties came into open conflict. The Orthodox party prevailed; in 337 Paul was elected and consecrated by bishops who happened to be at Constantinople in the Church of Peace, close to what was afterwards the Hagia Sophia. =First exile= The Emperor Constantius II had been away during these events. On his return he was angry at not having been consulted. He summoned a synod of Arian bishops, declared Paul quite unfit for the bishopric, banished him, and transported Eusebius of Nicomedia to Constantinople. This is thought to have been around 339. Paul, seeing himself rendered useless to his flock, while Arianism reigned in the East under the protection of Constantius, took shelter in the West, in the dominions of Constans. He went to Rome where he met Athanasius, who also had been expelled from his see.\\"Paul I\\", The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople Athanasius of Alexandria was then in exile from Alexandria, Marcellus from Ancyra, and Asclepas from Gaza; with them Paul betook himself to Rome and consulted Pope Julius I, who examined their cases severally, found them all staunch to the creed of Nicaea, admitted them to communion, espoused their cause, and wrote strongly to the bishops of the East. Athanasius and Paul recovered their sees; the Eastern bishops replied to Pope Julius altogether declining to act on his advice. =Second exile= Paul returned to Constantinople. Eusebius died in 341, and Paul was reinstated as bishop.Butler, Alban. The Lives of the Saints, Vol. VI, (1886) The Arians seized the occasion; Theognis of Nicaea, Theodorus of Heraclea, and other heterodox bishops, consecrated bishop Macedonius in the church of St. Paul; and again the city became the prey of a civil war. The Emperor Constantius was at Antioch when he heard of this, where he ordered Hermogenes, his general of cavalry, to see that Paul was again expelled. The people would not hear of violence being done to their bishop; they rushed upon the house where the general was, set fire to it, killed him on the spot, tied a rope round his feet, pulled him out from the burning building, and dragged him in triumph round the city. Constantius was not likely to pass over this rebellion against his authority. He rode on horseback at full speed to Constantinople, determined to make the people suffer heavily for their revolt. They met him, however, on their knees with tears and entreaties, and he contented himself with depriving them of half their allowance of corn, but ordered Paul to be driven from the city. =Third exile= Paul seems to have retired to Triers, but returned to Constantinople in 344, with letters of recommendation from Constans, the emperor of the West, who wrote to Constantius, that should Paul not receive his patriarchal see, he would attack him. Constantius only allowed Paul's re-establishment for fear of his brother's arms, and Paul's situation in the East continued very uneasy, for he had much to suffer from the power and malice of the Arian party. Constans died in 350. Constantius, in Antioch, ordered Philippus, prefect of the East, to once more expel Paul and to put Macedonius in his place. At a public bath called Zeuxippus, adjoining a palace by the shore of the Bosphorus, Philippus asked Paul to meet him, as if to discuss some public business. When Paul arrived, he showed him the emperor's letter, and ordered him to be quietly taken through the palace to the waterside, placed on board ship, and carried off to Thessalonica, his native town. Philippus allowed him to visit Illyricum and the remote provinces, but forbade him to set foot again in the East. Paul was later loaded with chains and taken to Singara in Mesopotamia, then to Emesa, and finally to Cucusus in Cappadocia. Here he was confined in a close, dark place, and left to starve to death. After he had passed six days without food, he was, to the great disappointment of his enemies, found alive. Upon which they strangled him, and gave out that he died after a short sickness. Paul's body was brought to Ancyra in Galatia, and, by the order of Theodosius the Great, was thence translated to Constantinople in 381, about thirty years after his death. It was buried there in the great church built by Macedonius, which from that time was known by no other name than that of St. Paul. His remains were removed to Venice in 1226, where they are kept with great respect in the church of St. Laurence. References ;Attribution * sources used by Sinclair: **Socrates Scholasticus, H.

They are used in aerospace and military applications, for ballistic-rated body armor fabric and ballistic composites, in marine cordage, marine hull reinforcement, and as an asbestos substitute. The name is a portmanteau of \\"aromatic polyamide\\". The chain molecules in the fibers are highly oriented along the fiber axis. As a result, a higher proportion of the chemical bond contributes more to fiber strength than in many other synthetic fibers. Aramides have a very high melting point (>500 °C). Common aramid brand names include Kevlar, Nomex, and Twaron. History Aromatic polyamides were first introduced in commercial applications in the early 1960s, with a meta-aramid fiber produced by DuPont as HT-1 and then under the trade name Nomex. This fiber, which handles similarly to normal textile apparel fibers, is characterized by its excellent resistance to heat, as it neither melts nor ignites in normal levels of oxygen. It is used extensively in the production of protective apparel, air filtration, thermal and electrical insulation, as well as a substitute for asbestos. Meta-aramids are also produced in the Netherlands and Japan by Teijin Aramid under the trade name Teijinconex, in Korea by Toray under the trade name Arawin, in China by Yantai Tayho under the trade name New Star, by SRO Group (China) under the trade name X-Fiper, and a variant of meta-aramid in France by Kermel under the trade name Kermel. Based on earlier research by Monsanto Company and Bayer, para-aramid fiber with much higher tenacity and elastic modulus was also developed in the 1960s and 1970s by DuPont and AkzoNobel, both profiting from their knowledge of rayon, polyester and nylon processing. In 1973 DuPont was the first company to introduce a para-aramid fiber, calling it Kevlar; this remains one of the best-known para-aramids and/or aramids. In 1978, Akzo introduced a similar fiber with roughly the same chemical structure calling it Twaron. Due to earlier patents on the production process, Akzo and DuPont engaged in a patent dispute in the 1980s. Twaron subsequently came under the ownership of the Teijin Aramid Company. In 2011, Yantai Tayho introduced similar fiber which is called Taparan in China (see Production). Para-aramids are used in many high-tech applications, such as aerospace and military applications, for \\"bullet-proof\\" body armor fabric. Both meta-aramid and para-aramid fiber can be used to make aramid paper. Aramid paper is used as electrical insulation materials and construction materials to make honeycomb core. Dupont made aramid paper in 1960s, calling it Nomex paper. Yantai Metastar Special Paper introduced an aramid paper in 2007, which is called metastar paper. Both Dupont and Yantai Metastar make meta-aramid and para-aramid paper. The Federal Trade Commission definition for aramid fiber is: > A manufactured fiber in which the fiber-forming substance is a long-chain > synthetic polyamide in which at least 85% of the amide linkages, (−CO−NH−) > are attached directly to two aromatic rings.Commercial Practices, Part 303, > §303.7 Generic names and definitions for manufactured fibers. Health During the 1990s, an in vitro test of aramid fibers showed they exhibited \\"many of the same effects on epithelial cells as did asbestos, including increased radiolabeled nucleotide incorporation into DNA and induction of ODC (ornithine decarboxylase) enzyme activity\\", raising the possibility of carcinogenic implications. However, in 2009, it was shown that inhaled aramid fibrils are shortened and quickly cleared from the body and pose little risk. A declaration of interest correction was later provided by the author of the study stating that \\"This review was commissioned and funded by DuPont and Teijin Aramid, but the author alone was responsible for the content and writing of the paper.\\" Production World capacity of para- aramid production was estimated at about 41,000 tonnes per year in 2002 and increases each year by 5–10%. In 2007 this means a total production capacity of around 55,000 tonnes per year. =Polymer preparation= Aramids are generally prepared by the reaction between an amine group and a carboxylic acid halide group. Simple AB homopolymers may look like :n NH2−Ar−COCl → −(NH−Ar−CO)n− + n HCl The most well-known aramids (Kevlar, Twaron, Nomex, New Star and Teijinconex) are AABB polymers. Nomex, Teijinconex and New Star contain predominantly the meta-linkage and are poly-metaphenylene isophthalamides (MPIA). Kevlar and Twaron are both p-phenylene terephthalamides (PPTA), the simplest form of the AABB para-polyaramide. PPTA is a product of p-phenylene diamine (PPD) and terephthaloyl dichloride (TDC or TCl). Production of PPTA relies on a co-solvent with an ionic component (calcium chloride, CaCl2) to occupy the hydrogen bonds of the amide groups, and an organic component (N-methyl pyrrolidone, NMP) to dissolve the aromatic polymer. This process was invented by Leo Vollbracht, who worked at the Dutch chemical firm Akzo. Apart from the carcinogenic hexamethylphosphorous triamide (HMPT), still no practical alternative of dissolving the polymer is known. The use of the NMP/CaCl2 system led to an extended patent dispute between Akzo and DuPont. =Spinning= After production of the polymer, the aramid fiber is produced by spinning the dissolved polymer to a solid fiber from a liquid chemical blend. Polymer solvent for spinning PPTA is generally 100% anhydrous sulfuric acid (H2SO4). =Appearances= * Fiber * Chopped fiber * Powder * Pulp Other types of aramids Besides meta-aramids like Nomex, other variations belong to the aramid fiber range. These are mainly of the copolyamide type, best known under the brand name Technora, as developed by Teijin and introduced in 1976. The manufacturing process of Technora reacts PPD and 3,4'-diaminodiphenylether (3,4'-ODA) with terephthaloyl chloride (TCl). This relatively simple process uses only one amide solvent, and therefore spinning can be done directly after the polymer production.

His sermons denouncing the occupation and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein gained him some degree of popularity amongst the Kuwaiti people. In 1992, he went to Bosnia and Herzegovina for nearly a month to do some \\"relief services\\" there. He later joined Muslim guerillas in the Bosnian War in summer 1994. The Kuwaiti government subsequently removed him from the mosque and banned him from giving sermons, as he used to stridently criticize the Kuwaiti government and other Arab governments, then he became a high school teacher of religion. Arrival in Afghanistan in June 2000 In June 2000, he left Kuwait for Afghanistan, where he met Osama bin Laden and joined his al-Qaeda organization. His affinity for public speaking and comparative youth put him at the head of al-Qaeda's attempt to widen its appeal from ultra-conservative and mostly elderly clerics to the general population and especially the youth of majority-Muslim countries; in this capacity, he quickly became the organization's spokesman. Al Wafa According to documents in the unclassified dossier from Adil Zamil Abdull Mohssin Al Zamil's Combatant Status Review Tribunal Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was also a founder of Al Wafa al Igatha al Islamia, a charity that the USA asserts provided a plausible front for al Qaeda's fund-raising efforts.documents (.pdf) from Adil Zamil Abdull Mohssin Al Zamil's Combatant Status Review Tribunal, 18 August 2004 One of the allegations against Al Zamil, who was also accused of being a founder of al Wafa, was that he helped Abu Ghaith's family leave Afghanistan around the time of the attacks of 9–11. Al Qaeda video after 9-11 He rose to worldwide attention following the 11 September 2001, attacks. On October 10, 2001, he appeared on two widely circulated videos (first broadcast on al Jazeera television) to defend the attacks and threaten reprisals for the subsequent US invasion of Afghanistan, saying, \\"Americans should know, the storm of the planes will not stop... There are thousands of the Islamic nation's youths who are eager to die just as the Americans are eager to live.\\" These statements caused the Kuwaiti government to strip him of his citizenship. In 2002, while living in Iran, he posted a statement asserting that al Qaeda has \\"the right to kill four million Americans, including one million children, displace double that figure, and injure and cripple hundreds and thousands.\\" Alleged connection to the Faylaka Island attackers According to The Long War Journal American officials assert that Sulaiman Abu Ghaith attended al Qaeda's airport training camp with Anas al Kandari and Faiz al Kandari. Anas al Kandari was a young Kuwaiti who fired upon a squad of marines, killing one, in the Faylaka Island attack in 2002. Faiz al Kandari is another Kuwaiti, who was held in extrajudicial detention in Guantanamo from 2002 to 2008. In 2008, charges were prepared against him to be referred to a Guantanamo military commission. According to The Long War Journal in his book The Martyr's Oath, Stewart Bell asserted Sulaiman Abu Ghaith recruited Anas al Kandari and the other shooter to launch the Faylaka Island attacks. Presence in Iran 2002–2013 His whereabouts, as he moved around to escape capture by the United States in the following months, are unclear. According to the Long War Journal, by 2002, Sulaiman was living in Iran. In July 2003, a Kuwaiti minister announced that the Iranian government was holding Abu Ghaith and that Kuwait had refused an offer from Iran to extradite him to Kuwait. In September 2010, the Long War Journal falsely reported that Abu Ghaith had been freed by Iran and had left the country for Afghanistan. In March 2013, it was reported that Abu Ghaith had spent most of the last ten years in Iran, under house arrest. Presence in Turkey 2013  In late January 2013, Abu Ghaith entered Turkey from Iran, staying in a hotel in Ankara. For a brief period, he was detained at the request of the United States, but was released since he had committed no crime in Turkey. At the time, Turkish authorities held him as \\"a guest\\" since he does not have a passport.Deniz Zeyrek: \\"ABD ile Ghaiht gerilimi\\", Radikal, 7 February 2013; translated and posted on Al-Monitor by Sibel Utku Bila on 8th, 2013 under the title ″Turkey-US Tension Develops Over Al-Qaeda Member\\". Rather than extradite him to the United States, the Turkish authorities decided to deport him to his home country, Kuwait. Arrest, extradition to the United States, and trial On a stopover in Amman, Jordan, Abu Ghaith was arrested by Jordanian officials and turned over to US authorities on 7 March 2013. He was subsequently extradited to the United States, and housed in a federal prison in New York. Abu Ghaith was indicted on charges of conspiring to kill Americans and tried in the Federal District Court in Manhattan (U.S. v. Abu Ghayth, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 98-cr-01023). He pleaded not guilty on 8 March 2013. On 8 April 2013, Abu Ghaith's attorneys were considering a request for change of venue, since New York City received the greatest loss from the attacks on 11 September 2001. Abu Ghaith's lawyers sought the right to call upon Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as a witness. On 18 March 2014, this request was denied by a New York federal judge. On 26 March 2014, Abu Ghaith was convicted of \\"conspiring to kill Americans and providing material support to terrorists\\" and he was subsequently sentenced to life in prison by U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. Personal life He married his first wife Fatima in Kuwait, with whom he had six daughters and a son. He then married an Egyptian woman named Amal, who was detained with him in Iran, with whom he had two daughters, then he married Osama bin Laden's daughter, Fatima, with whom he had a daughter and a son.

DNA methylation serves a wide variety of biological functions. All the known DNA methyltransferases use S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor.  Classification  = Substrate = MTases can be divided into three different groups on the basis of the chemical reactions they catalyze: * m6A - those that generate N6-methyladenine * m4C - those that generate N4-methylcytosine * m5C - those that generate C5-methylcytosine m6A and m4C methyltransferases are found primarily in prokaryotes (although recent evidence has suggested that m6A is abundant in eukaryotes). m5C methyltransfereases are found in some lower eukaryotes, in most higher plants, and in animals beginning with the echinoderms. The m6A methyltransferases (N-6 adenine-specific DNA methylase) (A-Mtase) are enzymes that specifically methylate the amino group at the C-6 position of adenines in DNA. They are found in the three existing types of bacterial restriction-modification systems (in type I system the A-Mtase is the product of the hsdM gene, and in type III it is the product of the mod gene). These enzymes are responsible for the methylation of specific DNA sequences in order to prevent the host from digesting its own genome via its restriction enzymes. These methylases have the same sequence specificity as their corresponding restriction enzymes. These enzymes contain a conserved motif Asp/Asn-Pro-Pro-Tyr/Phe in their N-terminal section, this conserved region could be involved in substrate binding or in the catalytic activity. The structure of N6-MTase TaqI (M.TaqI) has been resolved to 2.4 A. The molecule folds into 2 domains, an N-terminal catalytic domain, which contains the catalytic and cofactor binding sites, and comprises a central 9-stranded beta-sheet, surrounded by 5 helices; and a C-terminal DNA recognition domain, which is formed by 4 small beta-sheets and 8 alpha-helices. The N- and C-terminal domains form a cleft that accommodates the DNA substrate. A classification of N-MTases has been proposed, based on conserved motif (CM) arrangements. According to this classification, N6-MTases that have a DPPY motif (CM II) occurring after the FxGxG motif (CM I) are designated D12 class N6-adenine MTases. The type I restriction and modification system is composed of three polypeptides R, M and S. The M (hsdM) and S subunits together form a methyltransferase that methylates two adenine residues in complementary strands of a bipartite DNA recognition sequence. In the presence of the R subunit, the complex can also act as an endonuclease, binding to the same target sequence but cutting the DNA some distance from this site. Whether the DNA is cut or modified depends on the methylation state of the target sequence. When the target site is unmodified, the DNA is cut. When the target site is hemimethylated, the complex acts as a maintenance methyltransferase, modifying the DNA so that both strands become methylated. hsdM contains an alpha-helical domain at the N-terminus, the HsdM N-terminal domain. Among the m6A methyltransferases (N-6 adenine-specific DNA methylase) there is a group of orphan MTases that do not participate in the bacterial restriction/methylation system. These enzymes have a regulatory role in gene expression and cell cycle regulation. EcoDam from E. coli and CcrM from Caulobacter crescentus are well characterized members of these family. More recently, CamA from Clostridioides difficile, was shown to play key functional roles in sporulation, biofilm formations and host-adaptation. m4C methyltransferases (N-4 cytosine-specific DNA methylases) are enzymes that specifically methylate the amino group at the C-4 position of cytosines in DNA. Such enzymes are found as components of type II restriction-modification systems in prokaryotes. Such enzymes recognise a specific sequence in DNA and methylate a cytosine in that sequence. By this action they protect DNA from cleavage by type II restriction enzymes that recognise the same sequence m5C methyltransferases (C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylase) (C5 Mtase) are enzymes that specifically methylate the C-5 carbon of cytosines in DNA to produce C5-methylcytosine. In mammalian cells, cytosine-specific methyltransferases methylate certain CpG sequences, which are believed to modulate gene expression and cell differentiation. In bacteria, these enzymes are a component of restriction-modification systems and serve as valuable tools for the manipulation of DNA. The structure of HhaI methyltransferase (M.HhaI) has been resolved to 2.5 A: the molecule folds into 2 domains - a larger catalytic domain containing catalytic and cofactor binding sites, and a smaller DNA recognition domain. Highly conserved DNA methyltransferases of the m4C, m5C, and m6A types have been reported , which appear as promising targets for the development of novel epigenetic inhibitors to fight bacterial virulence, antibiotic resistance, among other biomedical applications. = De novo vs. maintenance = De novo methyltransferases recognize something in the DNA that allows them to newly methylate cytosines. These are expressed mainly in early embryo development and they set up the pattern of methylation. Maintenance methyltransferases add methylation to DNA when one strand is already methylated. These work throughout the life of the organism to maintain the methylation pattern that had been established by the de novo methyltransferases.  Mammalian  Three active DNA methyltransferases have been identified in mammals. They are named DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b. Recently, a fourth enzyme DNMT3c has been discovered specifically expressed in the male germline in the mouse. DNMT3L is a protein closely related to DNMT3a and DNMT3b in structure and critical for DNA methylation, but appears to be inactive on its own. = DNMT1 = DNMT1 is the most abundant DNA methyltransferase in mammalian cells, and considered to be the key maintenance methyltransferase in mammals. It predominantly methylates hemimethylated CpG di-nucleotides in the mammalian genome. Despite being able to use hemimethylated as well as unmethylated cytosine as a substrate DNMT1 is not involved in de novo methyaltion of the genome during mouse embryonic development. The recognition motif for the human enzyme involves only three of the bases in the CpG dinucleotide pair: a C on one strand and CpG on the other. This relaxed substrate specificity requirement allows it to methylate unusual structures like DNA slippage intermediates at de novo rates that equal its maintenance rate. Like other DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferases the human enzyme recognizes flipped out cytosines in double stranded DNA and operates by the nucleophilic attack mechanism. In human cancer cells DNMT1 is responsible for both de novo and maintenance methylation of tumor suppressor genes. The enzyme is about 1,620 amino acids long. The first 1,100 amino acids constitute the regulatory domain of the enzyme, and the remaining residues constitute the catalytic domain. These are joined by Gly-Lys repeats. Both domains are required for the catalytic function of DNMT1. DNMT1 has several isoforms, the somatic DNMT1, a splice variant (DNMT1b) and an oocyte-specific isoform (DNMT1o). DNMT1o is synthesized and stored in the cytoplasm of the oocyte and translocated to the cell nucleus during early embryonic development, while the somatic DNMT1 is always found in the nucleus of somatic tissue. DNMT1 null mutant embryonic stem cells were viable and contained a small percentage of methylated DNA and methyltransferase activity. Mouse embryos homozygous for a deletion in Dnmt1 die at 10–11 days gestation. = TRDMT1 = Although this enzyme has strong sequence similarities with 5-methylcytosine methyltransferases of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, in 2006, the enzyme was shown to methylate position 38 in aspartic acid transfer RNA and does not methylate DNA. The name for this methyltransferase has been changed from DNMT2 to TRDMT1 (tRNA aspartic acid methyltransferase 1) to better reflect its biological function. TRDMT1 is the first RNA cytosine methyltransferase to be identified in human cells. = DNMT3 = DNMT3 is a family of DNA methyltransferases that could methylate hemimethylated and unmethylated CpG at the same rate. The architecture of DNMT3 enzymes is similar to that of DNMT1, with a regulatory region attached to a catalytic domain. There are four known members of the DNMT3 family: DNMT3a, 3b, 3c and 3L. DNMT3a and DNMT3b can mediate methylation-independent gene repression. DNMT3a can co-localize with heterochromatin protein (HP1) and methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCBP). They can also interact with DNMT1, which might be a co-operative event during DNA methylation. DNMT3a prefers CpG methylation to CpA, CpT, and CpC methylation, though there appears to be some sequence preference of methylation for DNMT3a and DNMT3b. DNMT3a methylates CpG sites at a rate much slower than DNMT1, but greater than DNMT3b. DNMT3L contains DNA methyltransferase motifs and is required for establishing maternal genomic imprints, despite being catalytically inactive. DNMT3L is expressed during gametogenesis when genomic imprinting takes place. The loss of DNMT3L leads to bi-allelic expression of genes normally not expressed by the maternal allele. DNMT3L interacts with DNMT3a and DNMT3b and co-localized in the nucleus. Though DNMT3L appears incapable of methylation, it may participate in transcriptional repression.  Clinical significance  =DNMT inhibitors= Because of the epigenetic effects of the DNMT family, some DNMT inhibitors are under investigation for treatment of some cancers: * Vidaza (azacitidine) in phase III trials for myelodysplastic syndromes and AML * Dacogen (decitabine) in phase III trials for AML and CML. EU approved in 2012 for AML. *guadecitabine, an experimental drug under development by Astex Pharmaceuticals and Otsuka Pharmaceutical.

In common law jurisdictions, the practice dates back to medieval England and the English common law, in which sheriffs encouraged ordinary citizens to help apprehend law breakers. Despite the practice's name, in most countries, the arresting person is usually designated as a person with arrest powers, who need not be a citizen of the country in which they are acting. For example, in the British jurisdiction of England and Wales, the power comes from section 24A(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, called \\"any person arrest\\". This legislation states \\"any person\\" has these powers, and does not state that they need to be a British citizen. Legal and political aspects Anyone who makes a citizen's arrest can find themselves facing possible lawsuits or criminal charges - such as charges of false imprisonment, unlawful restraint, kidnapping, or wrongful arrest - if the wrong person is apprehended or a suspect's civil rights are violated. This is especially true when police forces are attempting to determine who an aggressor is. Private citizens do not enjoy the same immunity from civil liability when making arrests on other private citizens as do police officers. The level of responsibility that a person performing a citizen's arrest may bear depends on the jurisdiction. For instance, in France and Germany, a person stopping a criminal from committing a crime, including crimes against belongings, is not criminally responsible as long as the means employed are in proportion to the threat. Note, however, that in both countries, this results from a different legal norm, \\"aid to others in immediate danger\\", which is concerned with prevention, not prosecution, of crimes. Laws by country =Australia= In Australia, the power to arrest is granted by both federal and state legislation, however the exact power granted differs depending on jurisdiction. The power to arrest for a federal offence is granted by section 3Z of the Crimes Act 1914. Under the Act, a person who is not a police constable may, without warrant, arrest another person if they believe on reasonable grounds that: *the other person is committing or has just committed an indictable offence; and *proceedings by summons against the other person would not: ensure the appearance of the person before a court in respect of the offence; prevent a repetition or continuation of the offence or the commission of another offence; prevent the concealment, loss or destruction of evidence relating to the offence; prevent harassment of, or interference with, a person who may be required to give evidence in proceedings in respect of the offence; prevent the fabrication of evidence in respect of the offence; or would not preserve the safety or welfare of the person. A person who arrests another person must, as soon as practicable after the arrest, arrange for the other person, and any property found on the other person, to be delivered into the custody of a constable. Generally speaking, as regards the law in Australia: Where it is clear on the evidence that a private citizen, or security officer, in detaining a suspect, acted reasonably and the suspect unreasonably, then it is likely that the court will find in favour of the citizen or security officer and against the suspect if that suspect chooses, later, to sue the citizen for assault or false imprisonment. In other circumstances where, e.g. a property owner (or an agent) arrests a thief in a manner, and in circumstances, disproportionate to the likely harm to the victim, and in clear defiance of the rights of the suspect (for example, to be taken forthwith to a police station), then the court is very likely to find in favour of the suspect (guilty or otherwise). The courts may order compensation for such suspects in appropriate circumstances. New South Wales In the Australian state of New South Wales, the power to arrest is granted to anyone who is not a police officer by section 100 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW). Under the Act, a person may, without a warrant, arrest another person if: *the person is in the act of committing an offence under any Act or statutory instrument, or *the person has just committed any such offence, or *the person has committed a serious indictable offence for which the person has not been tried. Section 231 of the Act allows the use of such force as is \\"reasonably necessary to make the arrest or to prevent the escape of the person after arrest\\". A person who arrests another person under section 100 must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take the person, and any property found on the person, before a magistrate to be dealt with according to law. The magistrate will also decide whether or not the force applied in making the arrest was reasonable under the circumstances. According to the Law Society of New South Wales, the arresting person should: *inform the person that they are under arrest and *inform the person of the reasons for the arrest. Queensland In the Australian state of Queensland, the power to arrest is granted by section 546 of Schedule 1 to the Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld). Under the Act, any person who finds another committing an offence may, without warrant, arrest the other person. The power to arrest in Queensland also allows for arrest on suspicion of an offence: Section 260 of the Act also provides a power to arrest in preventing a breach of the peace: Following the arrest, the person arrested must, without delay, be handed over to a justice of the peace or police officer, in accordance with section 552 of the Criminal Code. Legal advice should then be sought to avoid any possible legal action for wrongful arrest, false imprisonment or assault. South Australia Section 271 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) grants arrest powers to a person in South Australia. Tasmania Under the Police Offences Act 1935 (Tas), section 55(3), any person may arrest any other person whom they find committing an offence, where they have reasonable grounds to believe that the conduct will create or may involve substantial injury to another person, serious danger of such injury, loss of property or serious injury to property. Section 55(5) states \\"For the purposes of this section, a person is said to be 'found offending' if he does any act, or makes any omission, or conducts or behaves himself, and thereby causes a person who finds him reasonable grounds for believing that he has, in respect of such act, omission, or conduct, committed an offence against this Act.\\" There are further provisions in section 301 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 (Tas) that appear to allow a sliding scale of force in executing an arrest. Victoria In the Australian state of Victoria, the power to arrest is granted in section 458 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic). It states that a person may, without a warrant, arrest a person that they find committing an offence for one or more of the following reasons: *to ensure the appearance of the offender in court, and/or *to preserve public order, and/or *to prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence, or the commission of a further offence, and/or *for the safety or welfare of the public or the offender. A person may also arrest another person if they are instructed to do so by a member of the police force, or if they believe on reasonable grounds that the offender is escaping legal custody. Section 461 states that if an arrest is made under section 458 of the Crimes Act, and is later proven to be false, then the arrest itself won't be considered unlawful if it was made on reasonable grounds. Section 462A allows any person the right to use force \\"not disproportionate to the objective as he believes on reasonable grounds to be necessary to prevent the commission, continuance or completion of an indictable offence or to effect or assist in effecting the lawful arrest of a person committing or suspected of committing any offence\\". Western Australia It was only in 2004 that the Western Australian parliament repealed the provisions of the former section 47 of the Police Act 1892 which allowed any person to arrest without a warrant \\"any reputed common prostitute, thief, loose, idle or disorderly person, who, within view of such person apprehending, shall offend against this Act, and shall forthwith deliver him to any constable or police officer of the place where he shall have been apprehended, to be taken and conveyed before a Justice, to be dealt with according to law …\\" A private citizen would have found it rather difficult to interpret the terms \\"loose\\" or \\"idle\\" with any degree of legal certainty. Citizen's arrest powers are now in section 25 of the Criminal Investigation Act 2006 (WA). The Territories ;Northern Territory :Under section 441(2) of the Criminal Code of the Northern Territory, any person can arrest another whom (s)he finds committing an offence or behaving such that he or she believes on reasonable grounds that the offender has committed an offence and that an arrest is necessary for a range of specified reasons. ;Australian Capital Territory : See the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT), section 218, which permits a citizen's arrest. =Austria= In Austria citizen's arrests (in German: Anhalterecht Privater) can be made under § 80 Abs 2 StPO (code of penal procedures).https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Dokumentnummer;=NOR40181029 The person making the arrest is allowed to hold the arrestee solely for the purpose of turning him over to a proper legal authority such as the police. =Brazil= In Brazil, a Federal law allows any person to arrest a suspect criminal found in flagrante delicto or fleeing from the crime scene. The person has to, at his/her own judgment, have the physical power to keep the suspect detained, has to verbally explain what (s)he is doing to the arrestee and has to call the police. Both have to wait for the arrival of the police. The person who makes a citizen's arrest has to sign the police forms as a witness and explain the facts. Typically it will lead to a time burden of at least two hours. If the facts cannot be verified the person who realizes the citizen's arrest might be sued by the arrestee. =Canada= Federal law Canada's blanket arrest authorities for crimes or violations of federal statutes are found in the Criminal Code. In Canada, a criminal offence is any offence that is created by a federal statute—there are no \\"provincial crimes\\". Criminal offences are divided into three groups: indictable, dual procedure, and summary conviction. For the purposes of arrest, dual procedure offences are considered to be indictable. The Criminal Code provisions related to citizen arrests were changed in 2012, by the Citizen's Arrest and Self- defence Act. As a consequence, it is now possible to make a citizen's arrest in Canada in circumstances where a \\"reasonable\\" amount of time has lapsed between the commission of a property-related offence and the arrest. Provincial law There are several arrest authorities found through the various provincial statutes. The most notable citizen's arrest authority in Ontario is found in the Trespass to Property Act, but there are others found in the Highway Traffic Act, the Liquor Licence Act, and many others. =China= Chinese criminal procedure lawCriminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China (2012 Amendment) empowers any citizen to make citizen's arrest: =Denmark= In Denmark, pursuant to § 755 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act, anyone may arrest a suspect found at or in the immediate vicinity of a crime scene if the criminal act is subject to public prosecution. The arrestee must as soon as possible be turned over to the police with information about the time of and reasons for the arrest. =Finland= In Finland, Coercive Measures Act 22.7.2011/806 gives a right to apprehend someone in the act of committing a crime (in flagrante delicto) or fleeing from the crime scene, if punishment for the crime might be imprisonment or the crime is petty assault, petty theft, petty embezzlement, petty unauthorized use, petty stealing of a motor vehicle for temporary use, petty damage to property or petty fraud. A person wanted by the police (arrest warrant) can be apprehended by anyone. After the apprehension, the detainee must be handed over to the police as soon as possible. If the criminal is resisting or tries to escape, the law gives a citizen the right to use an amount of force considered necessary, when considering the nature of the crime, the behavior of the apprehended and the situation as a whole. =France= French law allows any civilian to arrest a person caught in flagrante delicto committing a felony or misdemeanor punishable by a jail sentence, with the obligation to immediately bring that person before the nearest officer of police judiciaire, meaning a detective.Code of penal procedure (France), Article 73. In modern practice, one would detain the perpetrator and immediately call the nearest police, then hand over the perpetrator and any evidence to the first police officers to arrive at the scene. Use of force is not authorised, unless required for self-defense in case of violence on the part of the perpetrator. =Germany= Citizen's arrests (in German: Jedermann-Anhalte- und -Festnahmerecht) can be made under § 127 Ⅰ 1 StPO (code of penal procedures) if the arrestee is caught in flagrante delicto and either the identity of the person cannot be otherwise established immediately or they are suspected to try to flee.§ 127 StPO (code of penal procedures) (Germany). The person making the arrest is allowed to hold the arrestee solely for the purpose of turning them over to a proper legal authority such as the police. German law does not establish that the crime has to be serious, nor that the person making the arrest has to actually be a citizen of Germany. =Hong Kong= Citizen's arrest is known as the \\"101 power\\". Under the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (cap. 221 of the Laws of Hong Kong), section 101(2) provides that \\"Any person may arrest without warrant any person whom he may reasonably suspect of being guilty of an arrestable offence\\" using \\"force as is reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances\\".. Once an arrest is made, the suspect must be delivered to a police office as soon as possible for court proceedings. \\"Arrestable offence\\" is defined as any crimes that can be sentenced for more than 12 months of jail time.Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Hong Kong), Chapter 221, Section 101. =Hungary= According to article 273 of Act XC. of 2017 concerning Penal Procedure, anyone may arrest a person caught committing a felony, but is obliged to hand the person over to the \\"investigative authorities\\" immediately; if this is not possible, the police must be informed.https://net.jogtar.hu/jogszabaly?docid=A1700090.TV&celpara;=273&dbnum;=1&goto;=2195 =India= Section 43, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 states that: According to this section any private person may arrest or cause to be arrested =Ireland= The term \\"citizen's arrest\\" is colloquially used for arrest, without an arrest warrant, made by someone other than a member of the Garda Síochána. Despite the colloquial name, non-Irish citizens have performed such arrests. The law of the Republic of Ireland, being derived from English law, inherited the common law power for private individuals to arrest for felony or breach of the peace. The Criminal Law Act 1997 abolished the common- law distinction between felonies and misdemeanours and instead distinguishes \\"arrestable\\" and \\"non-arrestable\\" offences; arrestable offences are those punishable by at least five years' imprisonment, and private individuals may arrest those in flagrante, having committed, or about to commit an arrestable offence. Several other statutes which define offences likewise state \\"any person may arrest\\" someone committing the offence; relevant offences include making off without payment, hawking revenue stamps, and property damage — this last permits arrest for a past crime as well as one in progress. In addition, the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1976 schedules offences associated with the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and authorises anyone to arrest someone for committing or having committed such an offence, whether in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland. The 1976 act, and a similar Westminster act giving reciprocal extraterritorial jurisdiction, obviated the need for extradition between the jurisdictions, which would have been more controversial. If the arrester lacks reasonable cause to believe the arrested person to have committed the offence, the latter may sue the former for defamation, wrongful arrest, or trespass. For most offences, a private individual can only make such an arrest if the suspect would otherwise evade arrest by a Garda, and the arrester must surrender the suspect to Garda custody as soon as practicable. An exception is that stamp hawkers must be brought before the District Court. Citizen's arrests are rare; most often they are made by store detectives on shoplifting suspects. =Israel= An Israeli law allowing anyone to arrest a suspect whom they witnessed carrying out a felony was repealed in 1996 and a new law now allows the detention of a suspect by another person under certain conditions. Section 75 of the Criminal Procedure Law (Enforcement Powers – Arrest) of 1996 allows anyone to detain a person who is witnessed carrying out certain suspected crimes. The crimes include the following: a felony, theft, a crime of violence and a crime which has caused serious damage to property. A person using these detention powers may use reasonable force if their request is not met as long as they do not cause the suspect bruising. They must hand the suspect over to the police immediately and no later than three hours. Persons whose identity is known or who are not suspected of fleeing may not be detained. The law, which is relatively new, is used by both private individuals and private security but is problematic because it has not yet been interpreted by the courts. In early 2009, a magistrate's court in Jerusalem handed down a verdict convicting two private security officers of assault following a detention of a suspect who assaulted one of them. The court ruled that the guards were not allowed to detain the suspect who was seated in a taxi at the time and should have waited for the police to arrive. = Italy = Any private citizen can, according to article 383 of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure, arrest another person, provided they are caught \\"in flagranza di reato\\" (In flagrante delicto) and the felony they are caught committing includes mandatory arrest from the police and is \\"perseguibile d'ufficio\\", meaning that the judicial authority, once received the \\"notitia criminis\\" (a crime report), has the duty to commence prosecution, without a party necessarily filing a complaint. The person making the arrest is legally required to hand to police the arrested person and the corpus delicti to the judicial authority, failure to do so could result in the person making the arrest committing a crime. =Japan= In Japan, Section 213 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows anyone from civilians to firefighters witnessing any crime in progress to make an arrest. This is called genkouhan (現行犯, meaning in flagrante delicto).wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第213条 Most criminals who attempt to flee, or refuse to identify themselves, can be held until police arrive.wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第217条 However, making a citizen's arrest to prevent petty crime (e.g. illegal assembly, accidental injury, accidental trespass, defamation of character, leaving a parking lot without paying) is false imprisonment per Section 220 of the Criminal Code.wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第220条 =Latvia= Criminal Procedure Law in Latvia gives a right to any person to apprehend someone in the act of committing a crime (in flagrante delicto) or fleeing from the crime scene, if punishment for the crime might be imprisonment. Also a person wanted by the police, for whom there is an arrest warrant, can be arrested by anyone at any time. A person stopping a criminal from committing a crime is not criminally responsible as long as the means employed are in proportion to the threat. The arrested person must be handed over to the police immediately. =Malaysia= Section 27(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code allows for a private person to arrest a person who, in his view, has committed a seizable offence or a non-bailable offence:Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593) § 27(2). Sub-section 5 further allows the arrest of a person who commits an offence on or with respect to the property of another by any person who is using the property to which the injury is done, or by the servant of either of those persons or by any person authorized by or acting in aid of either of those persons:Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593) § 27(5). A \\"seizable offence\\" is defined as an offence in which a police officer may ordinarily arrest without warrant as per defined by the Code.Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593) § 2(1). =Mexico= Article 16 of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico allows any person to arrest a criminal found in flagrante delicto.Constitution of Mexico, Article 16 . A non-police officer doing so must immediately call the police, because it is illegal to retain or transport any person against their will; failing to do so is illegal deprivation of liberty, a crime similar to kidnapping that can result in a prison sentence for the perpetrator. In 2006, the celebrity bounty hunter Duane 'Dog' Chapman was charged with unlawful deprivation of liberty for arresting an American fugitive in Mexico and attempting to take him across the border to California without consulting police. =Nepal= Section 9(8) of The National Criminal Procedure (Code) Act, 2017 states : \\"If the police is not available for the time being at the time of commission of any offence, any person who is present at the time of commission of that offence or who is eye witness thereto may prevent the person committing such offence from going away or escaping and hand him or her over to the nearby police office.\\"http://www.moljpa.gov.np/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Criminal- procedure-code-Revised.pdf =New Zealand= In New Zealand, some legal protection exists to those making a citizen's arrest as provided in the Crimes Act 1961 in that there may be justification or protection from criminal responsibility. Justification of the arrest ensures the arresting person is not guilty of an offence and is not liable to any civil proceeding. Protection from criminal responsibility means those who make the arrest are not liable to any criminal proceedings. They are however liable for civil proceedings. The legislation is carefully worded and only applies to offences covered in the Crimes Act 1961, not other offences such as those covered in the Summary Offences Act 1981. Specifically, the Crimes Act 1961 states that everyone (not just New Zealand citizens) is justified in arresting without warrant:Crimes Act 1961, Section 35 & 36. * Any person found committing any offence against this Act which the maximum punishment is not less than 3 years' imprisonment; or * Any person found at night (9pm till 6am) committing any offence against this Act. Other situations where members of the public are protected from criminal responsibility when involved in arresting where: * They have been asked by a police officer to help arrest any person believed or suspected to have committed any offence unless they know that there is no reasonable ground for the belief or suspicion.Crimes Act 1961, Section 34. * They witness a breach of the peace, and therefore are justified in interfering to prevent its continuance or renewal, and may detain any person committing it, in order to hand them over to a police officer provided that the person interfering does not use more force than is reasonably necessary to prevent the continuance or renewal of the breach of the peace, or than is reasonably proportionate to the danger to be apprehended from its continuance or renewal.Crimes Act 1961, Section 42. Similar legislation applies to suppressions of riots by members of the public.Crimes Act 1961, Section 43. * They believe, on reasonable and probable grounds, someone has committed an offence against the Crimes Act 1961 and is fleeing and is being pursued by any one they believe can arrest that person for the offence (such as a police officer). This applies whether or not the offence has in fact been committed, and whether or not the arrested person committed it.Crimes Act 1961, Section 38. * The person making the arrest is entitled to perform a search on the suspect, provided (s)he is not working for the place of arrest (e.g. a security guard in a hospital). In all cases a person making a citizens arrest must hand over the suspect to a police officer at the earliest possible time. =Norway= In Norway, pursuant to § 176 of the Criminal Procedure Act any person may arrest a suspect caught at the scene or pursued from it. The arrestee must be handed over to the police immediately.. =Philippines= Although the Philippines does not have a national law covering citizen's arrest, the local government of Quezon City passed Ordinance 2307 or the \\"Citizen's Arrest Ordinance of Quezon City\\". Any citizens within the Quezon City area can arrest a person even without a warrant in the instances mentioned and provided by law. =Poland= In Poland any one has the right to apprehend a person caught in the act of committing an offence, or seized in a pursuit undertaken directly following the commission of an offence, if it is feared that such person may go into hiding or if his identity cannot be established. The apprehended person should be surrendered to the police without delay.Polish Code of Criminal Procedure Act of 6 June 1997 Article 243. = Russia = In Russia, any person is allowed to arrest someone in the act of committing a crime pursuant to articles 37 and 38 of the Criminal Code of Russia and the Ruling of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of Russia of 27 September 2012 if the person performing the arrest is certain that the arrestee has committed a crime. The arrest must be carried out with applying as little force as required for the apprehension and the arrestee should be surrendered to the police without delay. =Sweden= In Sweden, any person may arrest someone in the act of committing a crime, or fleeing from the crime scene, if the crime committed is punishable by imprisonment. A person wanted by the police, for whom there is an arrest warrant, can be arrested by anyone at any time. After the arrest, the police must be contacted as soon as possible. =Switzerland= According to the Swiss Criminal Procedure Code § 218,Swiss Criminal Procedure Code § 218. citizens have the right to arrest a person when there is insufficient time to obtain police assistance, provided that When making an arrest, private individuals may only use force as a last resort and any force used must be reasonable. Arrested persons must be handed over to the police as quickly as possible. =Taiwan= An arrest without a warrant is explicitly forbidden by the Article 8 in the Constitution of the Republic of China, \\"except in case of flagrante delicto as provided by law\\", as shown below: However, the first additional circumstance, i.e. \\"pursued with cries\\" has been considered ambiguous in recent years, leading to many ongoing discussions and controversies of whether this would cause an infringement of the personal freedom. =Turkey= Turkish Criminal Procedure Code states:Turkish Criminal Procedure Code =United Kingdom= England and Wales A citizen's arrest can be lawfully carried out on any person under section 24A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 for an indictable offence, including either way offences (in this section referred to simply as \\"an offence\\"), but with some exceptions listed below. A few examples of indictable and either way offences are theft, criminal damage, burglary, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, possession of an offensive weapon in a public place, possession of a controlled substance, etc. It is thus permissible for any person to arrest without warrant: *anyone who is in the act of committing an offence, or whom the arrestor has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be in the act of committing an offence, or *where an offence has been committed, anyone who is guilty of that offence or whom the arrestor has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be guilty of it However, both of following two conditions must also be satisfied: *it appears to the person making the arrest that it is not reasonably practicable for a police constable to make the arrest instead, and *the arrestor has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrest is necessary to prevent one or more of the following: **the person causing physical injury to themself or others, **the person suffering physical injury, **the person causing loss of or damage to property, or **the person absconding before a constable can assume responsibility for them Where an arrest is made after an offence has been committed, the person who makes the arrest must actually know, not simply suspect that an offence has actually been committed. If it later turns out that an offence had not been committed, such an arrest would be unlawful.R v Self [1992] 3 All ER 476 \\"Any person\\" powers can be used to arrest before an offence occurs as long as the offence in question falls within the Criminal Attempts Act 1981. This act creates the offence of an attempted offence, as long as the offence being attempted is an indictable. For this to apply, the offence must actually be in the process of being attempted - preparatory steps are not sufficient. Furthermore, the definition of what constitutes a \\"crime\\" was clarified in R v Jones (Margaret)https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060329/jones-3.htm which stated under the S3 CLA1967 meaning, it was held to be any domestic crime in England/Wales. Kent Police have released a brief yet comprehensive guide on reasonable force.http://library.college.police.uk/docs/APPref/use-of- force-briefing.pdf A citizen's arrest cannot be made: *inside a polling station, on a person who commits or is suspected of committing an offence of personation (that is, pretending to be someone else in order to vote) in elections, or *in relation to an offence of stirring up racial hatred or stirring up religious hatred under the Public Order Act 1986. Although a person cannot make a citizen's arrest before an offence takes place, they may use the power provided section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 to use reasonable force for the prevention of crime. This would not allow a citizen's arrest before an offence takes place in this sense but would allow any person to use reasonable force to prevent an offence from occurring; for example, restraining a suspected offender who raised a brick in their hand in order to imminently smash a window. A citizen's arrest is a form of lawful custody and anyone attempting to flee would commit the offence of escape from lawful custody. Similarly, a person who uses force to resists a citizen's arrest would commit the offence of assault with intent to resist arrest. In addition to an arrest without a warrant, where an arrest warrant is issued by a court, the warrant may name people (other than police officers) who are able to use it to arrest the person against whom it has been issued. = Other powers = A citizen's arrest is a form of lawful custody and anyone attempting to flee may be guilty of attempting to escape from lawful custody. Furthermore, the offence of 'assault with intent to resist arrest or lawful apprehension or detainer of himself' may apply if the arrestee assaulted the arrestor under Section 38 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/38 Both assault with intent to resist arrest/lawful apprehension and escaping from lawful custody are indictable, the former being so by the mode of trial of the offence, the latter is a common law offence and therefore indictable only. Therefore, these offences - whether fully carried out or merely attempted - are citizen's arrestable in themselves. A citizen's arrest may also be made technically for a warrant for an arrest if the offence listed is indictable as there is no law prohibiting a re-citizen's arrest or the number of times they may be arrested for it nor is there a time limit. The warrant would satisfy the requirement for the arrester to have reasonable grounds to suspect the guilt of the arrestee. For example, if an offender failed to attend Crown court this would satisfy two conditions for a lawful citizen's arrest at a later date - that the offence had taken place and that it was obviously indictable by way of being tried in Crown court. Although not technically citizen's arrest powers, any person also has the power to arrest for a common law breach of the peace which also provides any person with a power of entry. Section 3 Criminal Justice Act 1967 also provides any person the power to apprehend a person unlawfully at large e.g. an offender on a recall to prison or in the circumstances where someone has managed to escape from lawful custody. Until 2006, there was an \\"any person\\" power of arrest under part of the Theft Act 1968 in England and Wales that related to poaching, which was used by private water bailiffs (as opposed to Environment Agency bailiffs). This ceased to have effect as a result of a general repeal of such arrest powers by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.Paragraph 38 of Schedule 7 to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005; commenced by article 2(m) of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Commencement No. 4 and Transitory Provision) Order 2005 An officer or agent of certain companies may seize and detain any person who has committed an offence against the provisions of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 whose name and residence shall be but unknown to such officer or agent, and take them before a justice of the peace, who \\"shall proceed with all convenient dispatch to the hearing and determining of the complaint against such offender\\". Under the Standing Orders of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, the Serjeant at Arms has the power to take into custody any member of the public who is in a Members-only area of the House, or who misconducts themselves, or who fails to leave when the House sits in private. Court Security Officers in England and Wales have the additional power to restrain and remove persons from court buildings under s53 Courts Act 2003 as well as powers of search and seizure of certain articles. Northern Ireland Similar provisions apply to Northern Ireland as to England and Wales, implemented through the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (SI 1989/1341) as amended by the Police and Criminal Evidence (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order (SI 2007/288). Scotland While no statutory provision for citizen's arrest exists in Scots law, there is a common law position that anyone committing an offence can be arrested using minimum force if necessary with consideration to what is reasonable in the relevant circumstances. The offence must be a serious one and not merely for a breach of the peace. The person exercising the power must have witnessed the offence occurring therefore they cannot act upon information from another person. An arrest is applicable reliant on situation.House of Commons - Armed Forces - Minutes of Evidence.Citizen's Arrest (Hansard, 18 October 1995). =United States= In the United States a private person may arrest another without a warrant, for a crime occurring in their presence. However, the crimes for which this is permitted may vary by state. Common law Most states have codified the common law rule that a warrantless arrest may be made by a private person for a felony, misdemeanor or \\"breach of peace\\". \\"Breach of peace\\" covers a multitude of violations in which the Supreme Court has even included a misdemeanor seatbelt violation punishable only by a fine. The term historically included theft, \\"nightwalking\\", prostitution, and playing card and dice games. Texas courts have defined and interpreted the term “breach of the peace” to mean an act that disturbs or threatens to disturb the tranquility enjoyed by the citizens.Ross v. State, 802 4S.W.2d 308,314-15 (Tex.App. Dallas 1990,no pet.)https://www.txcourts.gov/All_Archived_Documents/14thCOA/Case/Opinions/110900/981070f.pdf State statutes Consider, for an example of this codification, California Penal Code section 837: > 837\\\\. A private person may arrest another: # For a public offense committed > or attempted in his/her presence. # When the person arrested has committed a > felony, although not in his/her presence. # When a felony has been in fact > committed, and he or she has reasonable cause for believing the person > arrested to have committed it. \\"Public offense\\" is read similarly as breach of peace in this case and includes felonies, misdemeanors and infractions. Note that there is generally no provision for an investigative detention by a private person under the law. With certain exceptions (see below) an arrest must be made. \\"Holding them until the police get there\\", is simply a form of arrest. The officer is accepting the arrest and processing the prisoner on behalf of the private person. In the case of felonies, a private person may make an arrest for a felony occurring outside their presence but the rule is that a felony must have, in fact, been committed. For example, consider a suspect that has been seen on surveillance video vandalizing a building to the extent that the arrestor believes it rises to a felony due to the damage. If they find the suspect and make the arrest but it later turns out that it was misdemeanor damage, the arrestor is liable for false arrest because a felony had not, in fact, been committed. Because most states have codified their arrest laws, there are many variations. For example, in Pennsylvania, the courts have been clear that a non-law enforcement officer cannot make an arrest for a \\"summary offense\\". In North Carolina, there is no de jure \\"citizens' arrest\\". Although it is essentially the same, North Carolina law refers to it as a \\"detention\\". Other states seem to allow only arrests in cases of felonies but court decisions have ruled more broadly. For example, in Virginia, the statute appears to only permit warrantless arrests by officers listed in the Code. However Virginia courts have upheld warrantless arrests by non-law enforcement personnel for breach of the peace misdemeanors. Other non-police persons are granted arrest authority by statute, in the case of those who are state certified armed security officers: \\"A registered armed security officer of a private security services business while at a location which the business is contracted to protect shall have the power to effect an arrest for an offense occurring (i) in his presence on such premises or (ii) in the presence of a merchant, agent, or employee of the merchant the private security business has contracted to protect\\" and \\"For the purposes of § 19.2-74, a registered armed security officer of a private security services business shall be considered an arresting officer.\\" Use of force In general, a private person is justified in using non-deadly force upon another if they reasonably believe that: (1) such other person is committing a felony, or a misdemeanor amounting to a breach of the peace; and (2) the force used is necessary to prevent further commission of the offense and to apprehend the offender. The force must be reasonable under the circumstances to restrain the individual arrested. This includes the nature of the offense and the amount of force required to overcome resistance. In at least one state, a civilian may use reasonable force, including deadly force if reasonable, to prevent an escape from a lawful citizen's arrest.Texas Penal Code 9.51(b)Texas Penal Code 9.51(d)  Shopkeeper's (merchant's) privilege  In some states of the United States, the courts recognize a common law shopkeeper's privilege, under which a shopkeeper is allowed to detain a suspected shoplifter on store property for a reasonable period of time, so long as the shopkeeper has cause to believe that the person detained in fact committed, or attempted to commit, theft of store property. The purpose of this detention is to recover the property and make an arrest if the merchant desires.W. Page, Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts § 22, at 142 (5th ed. 1984)  Differing liability from police  Private persons are occasionally granted immunity from civil or criminal liability, like the police are, when arresting others.http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_15A/Article_20.pdf While the powers to arrest are similar, police are entitled to mistake of fact in most cases, while civilians can be held to a stricter liability depending on the individual state. Police can also detain anyone upon reasonable suspicion. However, ordinary citizens cannot claim \\"qualified immunity\\" to attempt to defend against a civil complaint for false arrest.https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity See also *R. v.

The bathing machine was a device, popular from the 18th century until the early 20th century, to allow people to change out of their usual clothes, change into swimwear, and wade in the ocean at beaches. Bathing machines were roofed and walled wooden carts rolled into the sea. Some had solid wooden walls, others canvas walls over a wooden frame, and commonly walls at the sides and curtained doors at each end. The use of bathing machines as part of the etiquette for sea-bathing was more rigorously enforced upon women than men, but it was to be observed by both sexes among those who wished to behave respectably. Especially in Britain, men and women were usually segregated, so that people of the opposite sex should not see them in their bathing suits, which (although extremely modest by modern standards) were not considered proper clothing in which to be seen in public. Use Sea bathing in mid Wales c.1800. Several bathing machines can be seen The bathing machines in use in Margate, Kent, were described by Walley Chamberlain Oulton in 1805 as: People entered the small room of the machine while it was on the beach, wearing their street clothing. In the machine they changed into their bathing suit, although men were allowed to bathe nude until the 1860s, placing their street clothes into a raised compartment where they would remain dry.Kidwell, Claudia. Women’s Bathing and Swimming Costume in the United States. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1968. Mermaids at Brighton swim behind their bathing machines in this engraving by William Heath, c. 1829. Probably all bathing machines had small windows, but one writer in the Manchester Guardian of May 26, 1906 considered them \\"ill-lighted\\" and wondered why bathing machines were not improved with a skylight. The machine would then be wheeled or slid into the water. The most common machines had large wide wheels and were propelled in and out of the surf by a horse or a pair of horses with a driver. Less common were machines pushed in and out of the water by human power. Some resorts had wooden rails into the water for the wheels to roll on; a few had bathing machines pulled in and out by cables propelled by a steam engine. Once in the water, the occupants disembarked from the sea side down steps into the water. Many machines had doors front and back; those with only one door would be backed into the sea or need to be turned around. It was considered essential that the machine blocked any view of the bather from the shore. Some machines were equipped with a canvas tent lowered from the seaside door, sometimes capable of being lowered to the water, giving the bather greater privacy. Some resorts employed a dipper, a strong person of the same sex who would assist the bather in and out of the sea. Some dippers were said to push bathers into the water, then yank them out, considered part of the experience. Man and woman in swimsuits, c. 1910. The woman is exiting a bathing machine. Once mixed-sex bathing became socially acceptable, the days of the bathing machine were numbered. Bathing machines would often be equipped with a small flag which could be raised by the bather as a signal to the driver that they were ready to return to shore. History According to some sources, the bathing machine was developed in 1750 in Margate, Kent, though this may relate primarily to the \\"modesty hood\\" (bathing costumes were not yet common and most people bathed naked). \\"Mr. Benjamin Beale, a Quaker, was the inventor of the Bath Machine. Their structure is simple, but quite convenient; and by means of the umbrella, the pleasures of bathing may be enjoyed in so private a manner, as to be consistent with the strictest delicacy.\\" In Scarborough Public Library there is an engraving by John Setterington dated 1736 which shows people bathing and popularly believed to be first evidence for bathing machines, however Devon claims this was a year earlier in 1735.Library Etchings (archived) at Devon Queen Victoria's bathing machine (restored) Bathing machines were most common in the United Kingdom and parts of the British Empire with a British population, but were also used in France, Germany, the United States, Mexico, and other nations. Prince Albert used one at Osborne Beach near Osborne House on the Isle of Wight as did Queen Victoria who used it to sketch and for bathing; she wrote about such an experience in her diary in July 1847.Why does the Queen use a “bathing machine” to go swimming in ITV’s Victoria? After the monarch's death, her machine was used as a chicken coop, but it was restored in the 1950s and put on display in 2012.Bathing MachineQueen Victoria's beach and bathing machine on public view According to a news report, \\"The queen's bathing machine was unusually ornate, with a front verandah and curtains which would conceal her until she had entered the water. The interior had a changing room and a plumbed-in WC\\".Victoria's plunge: Queen's beach to open to public Legal segregation of bathing areas in Britain ended in 1901, and the bathing machine declined rapidly. By the start of the 1920s, bathing machines were almost extinct, even on beaches catering to an older clientele.Manning-Sanders, Ruth. Seaside England. B T Batsford, 1951. The bathing machines remained in active use on English beaches until the 1890s, when they began to be parked on the beach. They were then used as stationary changing rooms for a number of years. Most of them had disappeared in the United Kingdom by 1914.Bathing by Jane Austen Society of Australia However, in Aldeburgh, Suffolk, Eric Ravilious was able to paint bathing machines on wheels with winches still in use as late as 1938.Lara Feigel, Alexandra Harris, Modernism on Sea: Art and Culture at the British Seaside (2009), p. 212 In many places around the world they have survived to this day as stationary bathing boxes.

He inspired the establishment of the Macedonians, a sect later declared heretical. Biography After Bishop Alexander's death in 336, his orthodox followers supported Paul I of Constantinople. On the other hand, the Arians rallied round Macedonius. The former was ordained bishop, but did not hold his bishopric long. The Semi-Arian emperor Constantius II came to Constantinople, convened a synod of Arian bishops, banished Paul I, and, to the disappointment of Macedonius, translated Eusebius of Nicomedia to the vacant see. This was thought to have been in 338. cites Socr. ii. 7. Eusebius's death in 341 restarted hostilities between the partisans of Paul and Macedonius. Paul returned, and was introduced into the Irene church of Constantinople; Arian bishops immediately ordained Macedonius in St. Paul's church. So violent did the tumult become that Constantius sent his general Hermogenes to eject Paul for a second time. His soldiers met with open resistance; the general was killed and his body dragged through the city. cites Socr. ii. 13. Constantius at once left Antioch and punished Constantinople by depriving the people of half their daily allowance of corn. Paul was expelled; Macedonius was severely blamed for his part in these disturbances, and for allowing himself to be ordained without imperial sanction; but over all the Arians triumphed. Macedonius was permitted to officiate the church in which he had been consecrated. Paul went to Rome, and he and Athanasius of Alexandria and other orthodox bishops expelled from their sees were sent back by Pope Julius I with letters rebuking those who had deposed them. Philip the prefect executed the fresh orders of the emperor in hurrying Paul into exile to Thessalonica, and in reinstating Macedonius, but not without bloodshed. cites Socr. ii. 16. Macedonius held the see for about six years, while letters and delegates, the pope and the emperors, synods and counter-synods, were debating and disputing the treatment of Paul and Athanasius. In 349 the alternative of war offered by Constans, emperor of the West, induced Constantius to reinstate Paul; and Macedonius had to retire to a private church. The murder of Constans in 350 placed the East under the sole control of Constantius, and Paul was at once exiled. Imperial edicts followed, which permitted the Arians to claim to be the dominant faction in the church. Macedonius is said to have signalled his return to power by acts which, if truly reported, brand him as a cruel bigot. The Novatianists suffered perhaps even more fearfully than the orthodox and some of them were stung into a desperate resistance: those of Constantinople removing the materials of their church to a distant suburb of the city; those at Mantinium in Paphlagonia daring to face the imperial soldiers sent to expel them from their home. \\"The exploits of Macedonius,\\" says Socrates Scholasticus, \\"on behalf of Christianity, consisted of murders, battles, incarcerations, and civil wars\\". cites Socr. ii. 38 An act of presumption finally lost him the imperial favor in 358. The Sepulchre containing the body of Constantine I was in danger of falling to pieces, and Macedonius determined to remove them. The question was made a party one. The orthodox assailed as sacrilege \\"the disinterment of the supporter of the Nicene faith,\\" the Macedonians pleaded the necessities of structural repair. When the remains were conveyed to the church of Acacius the Martyr, the excited populace met in the church and churchyard; so frightful a carnage ensued that the place was filled with blood and slaughtered bodies. cites Socr. II. 38. Constantius's anger was great against Macedonius because of the slaughter, but even more because he had removed the body without consulting him. When Macedonius presented himself at the council of Seleucia in 359, it was ruled that being under accusation it was not proper for him to remain (Socr. ii. 40). His opponents, Acacius, Eudoxius, and others, followed him to Constantinople, and, availing themselves of the emperor's indignation, deposed him in 360 on the ground of cruelty and canonical irregularities. Macedonius retired to a suburb of the city, and died there. He is said to have elaborated the views with which his name is connected in his retirement. The \\"Macedonians\\", his followers, did not believe in the divinity of the Holy Spirit. His doctrine was embraced by Eleusius and others; and Macedonius brought so much zeal to the cause that its upholders were sometimes better known as Marathonians. Their grave, ascetic manners and pleasing and persuasive eloquence secured many followers in Constantinople, and also in Thrace, Bithynia, and the Hellespontine provinces. Under the emperor Julian they were strong enough to declare in synod at Zele in Pontus their separation from both Arians and orthodox. In 374 Pope Damasus I and in 381 the First Council of Constantinople condemned their views, and they gradually ceased to exist as a distinctive sect.

The family is named for their silky plumage and their aerial flycatching techniques, although they are unrelated to the Old World flycatchers (Muscicapidae) and the tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae). They occur mainly in Central America from Panama to Mexico, with one species, the phainopepla, extending northwards into the southwestern US. Most do not engage in long-distance migration (instead wandering widely in search of fruit), but the phainopepla is migratory over the northern part of its range. They are related to waxwings, and like that group have soft silky plumage, usually gray or pale yellow in color. All species, with the exception of the black-and-yellow phainoptila, have small crests. They range in size from 18 to 25 cm in length and are mostly slender birds (with the exception again of the black-and-yellow phainoptila). All the species in this family are sexually dimorphic in both plumage color and tail length. Juveniles of both sexes are colored like the female. These birds eat fruit or insects.

The performer is generally given a scene, or selected lines and actions, and instructed to perform in front of a camera to see if they are suitable. The developed film is later evaluated by the relevant production personnel such as the casting director and the director. The actor may be asked to bring a prepared monologue or alternatively, the actor may be given a script to read at sight (\\"cold reading\\"). In some cases, the actor may be asked to read a scene, in which another performer reads the lines of another character. Types Screen tests can also be used to judge the suitability of costume, make-up and other details, but these are generally called costume or make-up tests. Different types of actors can have different tasks for each individual test. For example, a lead for a musical theater-type movie could be requested to sing a popular song or learn a dance routine. Screen tests are routinely used in films and commercials. They are also used for short films. International actors such as Bruce Lee were given screen tests to demonstrate that they are sufficiently articulate in the relevant language. In Lee's case, for the role of Kato in The Green Hornet, he was asked to converse about Chinese culture in English to judge his grasp of the language, then to demonstrate some martial arts moves to show off his physical skills.

Eudoxius was one of the most influential Arians. Biography Eudoxius was from Arabissos of Asia Minor.\\"Eudoxius (of Antioch)\\", The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople Eudoxius came to Eustathius, bishop of Antioch between 324 and 331, seeking holy orders. However, Eustathius found his doctrine unsound and refused him. Nevertheless, when Eustathius was deposed, the Arians or Eusebians had everything their own way and admitted Eudoxius to orders and made him bishop of Germanicia, on the confines of Syria, Cilicia, and Cappadocia. This bishopric he held at least 17 years, the period of the principal intrigues against Athanasius, and of the reigns of Constantine the Great's sons. In 341 the council of the Dedication or Encaenia was held under Placillus at Antioch. Eudoxius of Germanicia attended. He was an Arian pure and simple, a disciple of Aetius, a friend of Eunomius. The council produced four creeds, in which the Eusebian party succeeded in making their doctrine as plausible as might be, and the second of these became known as the \\"Creed of the Dedication\\". Athanasius says that Eudoxius was sent with Martyrius and Macedonius to take the new creed of Antioch to Italy. This new creed may, however, have been the Macrostich, or Long Formula, drawn up at a later council of Antioch. In 343 or 347 the rival councils of Sardica and Philippopolis were held. At the latter was drawn up a creed more Arian than those of Antioch, and it was signed by Eudoxius. Between 355 and 359 Eudoxius was in attendance on the emperor in the West, when news came of the death of Leontius of Antioch.Socrates Scholasticus, Church History, book 2, chapter 37. Against the canons, he took over the see of Antioch. Allegedly excusing himself on the plea that the affairs of Germanicia required his presence, Eudoxius hastened to Antioch, and, representing himself as nominated by the emperor, got himself made bishop, and sent Asphalus, a presbyter of Antioch, to make the best of the case at court. Emperor Constantius II wrote to the church of Antioch: \\"Eudoxius went to seek you without my sending him. . . . To what restraint will men be amenable, who impudently pass from city to city, seeking with a most unlawful appetite every occasion to enrich themselves?\\". Nonetheless, the emperor confirmed the election. In the first year of his episcopate at Antioch Eudoxius held a council, which received the creed of Sirmium. An idea may be formed of the Homoousian reception of his sermons from three different sources. Hilary of Poitiers, then in the East, heard Eudoxius in his cathedral, and wished his ears had been deaf. Theodoret and Epiphanius of Cyprus reported him as boasting that he had the same knowledge about God as God had about Himself. In September 359, a Council of Seleucia was held at Seleucia Isauria, the orthodox forming a very small minority. The majority signed the \\"Creed of the Dedication\\"; Eudoxius who was present, was deposed by Basil of Ancyra's party, and appears to have sought the shelter of the court at Constantinople. Here, by the aid of the Acacians, he secured his appointment as bishop on the deposition of Macedonius, and on January 27, 360, took possession of his throne in the presence of 72 bishops. On February 15 the great church of Constantinople, Saint Sophia, begun in 342 by the emperor Constantius II, was dedicated. Eudoxius, it is claimed, mounting his episcopal throne before the expectant multitude of courtiers, ecclesiastics, and citizens, began with the words: \\"The Father is asebes, the Son is eusebes.\\" A great tumult of indignation arose on all sides in St. Sophia. The orator, unabashed, explained: \\"The Father is asebes because He honours nobody; the Son is eusebes because He honours the Father.\\" The new cathedral echoed with peals of uncontrollable laughter. Thus, says Socrates Scholasticus, cites Socr. H. E. ii. 43. these tore the church to pieces by their captious subtilties. Eudoxius consecrated his friend Eunomius to the see of Cyzicus; but such complaints were brought to the emperor Constantius II that he ordered Eudoxius to depose him. Eudoxius acquiesced to the emperor's command and quietly persuaded Eunomius to retire. In 365 an attack was made on Eudoxius by the semi-Arians, now called Macedonians. Holding a meeting at Lampsacus, they signed the \\"Creed of the Dedication,\\" cited Eudoxius and his party before them, and, as they did not come, sentenced them to deprivation; but emperor Valens refused to confirm the proceedings. In 367 Valens, as he was setting out for the Gothic War, was induced by his wife Albia Dominica to receive baptism from Eudoxius. In the same year he issued, likely under the advice of Eudoxius, an order that such bishops as had been banished by Constantius and had returned under Julian should again be exiled. The years during which Eudoxius and Valens acted together were allegedly troubled by portents, which Homoousians attributed to the anger of Heaven at Valens' banishment of bishops who would not admit Eudoxius to their communion. Eudoxius died in 370. References ;Attribution * Sinclair cites: **Athanasius. ad Solit. in Patr. Gk. xxvi. 572, 219, 589, 274, 580, 713, 601; **Epiphanius of Cyprus de Haeres. lxxiii. 2; ** H.

It is generally considered by universities and the legal profession to be the authoritative source on Australian English. It also pays considerable attention to New Zealand English. Originally it was a publishing project of Jacaranda Press, a Brisbane educational publisher, for which an editorial committee was formed, largely from the Linguistics department of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. It is now published by Macquarie Dictionary Publishers, an imprint of Pan Macmillan Australia Pty Ltd. In October 2007 it moved its editorial office from Macquarie University to the University of Sydney, and later to the Pan Macmillan offices in the Sydney central business district. History The first seven editions of the Macquarie Dictionary were edited by lexicographer Susan Butler, who joined the project in 1970 as a research assistant, and was its chief editor by the time the first edition was published in 1981. Butler retired as the Macquarie's editor in March 2018 after 48 years with the publisher. = First Edition = The original version of the Macquarie Dictionary was based on Hamlyn's Encyclopedic World Dictionary of 1971, which in turn was based on Random House's American College Dictionary of 1947, which was based on the 1927 New Century Dictionary, which was based on The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language, which itself was based on Noah Webster's American Dictionary of the English Language second edition of 1841. Since its first publication in 1981, its use has grown so that it has come to rival longer-established dictionaries from elsewhere in the English-speaking world as a standard authority on the English language within Australia. = Second Edition = The second edition was published in 1991 and introduced encyclopedic content to many entries. The Macquarie Dictionary Fifth EditionThe Macquarie Dictionary Sixth Edition = Third Edition = The third edition, published in 1997, made use of an in-house corpus of Australian writing, Ozcorp, to add a large number of examples of Australian usage, to give some of the flavour of an historical dictionary. This edition also gave a good coverage of English in Asia. = Fourth Edition = The fourth edition, published in 2005, increases the number of citations, includes etymologies for many phrases and pays particular attention to Australian regionalisms. = Fifth Edition = The fifth edition was published in October 2009 and places particular emphasis on words relating to the environment and climate change. = Sixth Edition = The sixth edition was published in October 2013 and includes an update of new words and senses as well as words and phrases from other varieties of English that impinge on Australian English, such as British English, American English and English in Southeast Asia, China and India. = Seventh Edition = The seventh edition of the Macquarie Dictionary was published on 28 February 2017. With a foreword by Kate Grenville, this latest edition includes thousands of new words and senses along with Australian regionalisms and a collection of words from the Australian experience in WW1. = Eighth Edition = The eighth edition of the Macquarie Dictionary was published on 28 July 2020.https://www.panmacmillan.com.au/9781760556594/macquarie-dictionary- eighth-edition/ With a foreword by Kim Scott, the Macquarie Dictionary Eighth Edition features 3500 new entries, including up to date entries on the COVID-19 pandemic.https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/blog/article/708/  Preferred spellings  The dictionary records standard Australian English spelling, which is closer to British than American spelling, with spellings like colour, centre, defence and practice/practise (noun/verb). It gives -ise spellings first, listing -ize spellings as acceptable variants, unlike the Oxford English Dictionary and some other dictionaries of British English, which continue to prefer -ize to -ise in spite of the opposite tendency amongst the British general public (see Oxford spelling). Labour, however, is sometimes spelt labor, especially in reference to the Australian political party. One difference from British usage is the word program, which the Macquarie Dictionary gives as the preferred spelling.  Collaborations  = Word of the Year = Each year the editors select a short-list of new words added to the dictionary, and invite the public to vote on their favourite. The public vote is held in January and results in the People's Choice winner. There is also a word selected by a committee. =Word for Word podcast= In Word for Word, the team behind the Macquarie Dictionary explore the surprising history behind everyday words and phrases, go behind the scenes with the dictionary editors, and meet some of Australia's most interesting word-lovers, from Scrabble champions to hip-hop artists. Versions A number of smaller versions are available, including a pocket edition, as well as companion volumes such as a thesaurus. The latest edition of the main complete version of the Macquarie Dictionary is the eighth, published in 2020. Both the complete dictionary as well as a student dictionary are available as iOS applications. =Macquarie Dictionary Online= The Macquarie Dictionary Online is the most comprehensive and up-to-date version of the dictionary available, with new words, phrases, and definitions added twice annually.

Farrell created the touring festival Lollapalooza as a farewell tour for Jane's Addiction in 1991; it has since evolved into an annual destination festival. Farrell continues to produce Lollapalooza with partners William Morris Agency and C3 Presents. Farrell has also led the alternative rock groups Porno for Pyros and Satellite Party. Biography Born as Peretz Bernstein in Queens, New York City, New York, he spent his grade-school years in Woodmere, Long Island, and moved to North Miami Beach, Florida, with his Jewish family during his teens.Mullen, Brendan. Google Books, Whores: An Oral Biography of Perry Farrell and Jane's Addiction. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2005. His father was a jeweler and his mother was an artist who died by suicide when Farrell was three, an event later noted in the Jane's Addiction songs \\"Then She Did\\" and \\"Twisted Tales\\". His early musical influences included The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Sly & The Family Stone and James Brown. Soon after, he discovered David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. Following graduation from high school, Farrell moved to California in the early 1980s to live as a surfer. There, he lived in his car and made money working construction and waiting tables. He has a son, Yobel (born 1998), with ex-girlfriend Christine Cagle.http://www.mtv.com/news/1428875/perry-farrells-a-poppa/ In 2002, Farrell married Etty Lau Farrell, a professional dancer and singer who has performed in all the Jane's Addiction shows since the 1997 Relapse tour. The couple now have two sons together, Hezron Wolfgang and Izzadore Bravo. Music career =Psi Com (1981–1985)= He became the frontman for the Post-punk band Psi Com in Los Angeles, and traveled in a larger community of area musicians including the bands X, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Fishbone, and Minutemen. Psi Com broke up around 1985 and Farrell met Eric Avery through mutual friends. The two began jam sessions which would become the initial foundation for Jane's Addiction. It was during this period that Bernstein chose the pseudonym Perry Farrell for himself as a play on the word \\"peripheral\\". =Jane's Addiction (1985–1991, 1997, 2001–2004, 2008–present)= Jane's Addiction made its name in mid-1980s LA by building up a rabid fan base with legendary, high-energy shows in small LA rock clubs. Jane's Addiction, prior to their first break-up, released three albums Jane's Addiction, Nothing's Shocking and Ritual de lo Habitual. A B-sides album from the Ritual sessions, titled Live and Rare was released in Japan. Late in 1991, Jane's Addiction broke up due to internal tensions over differing ideologies mostly centering on drug use, notably Farrell's severe addiction to heroin. Around this time, as mentioned in the SPIN Magazine (1991 Vol. 7 Num. 3) article about their \\"Ritual\\" tour, a rumor got around that Farrell had contracted HIV. Apparently for amusement, Farrell would tease audiences with \\"news\\" of his supposed health and would neither confirm nor deny its truth. In 1993 Farrell and his ex-girlfriend Casey Niccoli released a film called Gift that featured Jane's Addiction. Gift was released by Warner Brothers. In 1997, Jane's Addiction reformed for a brief reunion tour with Flea replacing Avery on bass. The \\"Relapse Tour\\" was supported with the release of Kettle Whistle, a rarities album featuring four new songs. Farrell has sometimes been credited with changing the fortunes of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Following the festival's disastrous first year in 1999, the event was not held in 2000. In 2001, a decision was made to organize the festival again, but just a few months before the festival was set to occur, there was still no headlining group. Farrell, who was friends with the festival's organizers, decided to reunite Jane's Addiction for the 2001 event, which helped draw large crowds and allowed the festival to yield a profit (which was not the case in 1999). This began a Coachella tradition of reuniting at least one major artist each year. Farrell again toured with Jane's Addiction in 2001 and 2003. In 2003, Jane's Addiction released an album, Strays. It quickly became one of their best selling records and was certified gold in the USA and silver in UK. They toured extensively in North America and Europe, brought back Lollapalooza for the first time since 1997, as well as performing at the Big Day Out festivals in Australia and New Zealand. Internal struggles saw the band split up again in early 2004. A \\"best of\\" release following the breakup of this incarnation of the band was released in 2006, titled Up from the Catacombs. The four original members of Jane's Addiction played their first show together in 17 years at the first United States edition of the NME Awards on April 23, 2008, and played two small shows in Los Angeles during Winter 2008. The band is the first American band to receive the \\"God Like Genius\\" Award. The reunited Jane's Addiction re-debuted at SXSW in 2009 and kicked off a summer tour with Nine Inch Nails. Eric Avery again left the band in late 2009, leaving Farrell, Navarro and Perkins as the remaining members of Jane's Addiction. The band with Dave Sitek on bass released The Great Escape Artist in 2011 and have continued to tour. =Porno for Pyros (1992–1998)= Following the break-up of Jane's Addiction, Farrell formed Porno for Pyros with former bandmate Stephen Perkins as well as newcomers Peter DiStefano on guitar and Martyn LeNoble on bass. Together they released two albums, Porno for Pyros and Good God's Urge. =Solo career (1999–present)= Perry Farrell with Jane's Addiction December 3, 2009 Kicking off his solo career, Farrell released rev in 1999, a compilation featuring songs from his previous two bands as well as two new solo songs. In 2001, he released his debut solo album, Song Yet to Be Sung, whose lyrics are inspired by Kabballah. Farrell has released a number of solo tracks online, all of them recorded with the involvement of wife Etty Lau. Their song \\"Go All the Way (Into the Twilight)\\" appeared on the Twilight film soundtrack. In October 2018, Farrell signed with BMG Rights Management, which will release his upcoming album Kind Heaven in 2019. =Satellite Party (2004–2008)= Farrell performing at the London Astoria in June 2007 Farrell formed a new band/theatrical entity entitled The Satellite Party. Satellite Party is a concept album and is the story of a fictional band of musicians called The Solutionists who are trying to change the world. Farrell conceived the project with his wife Etty Lau Farrell. Etty sings and plays her part on the record as well as the live stage shows. Satellite Party made its debut in Los Angeles at The Key Club on July 18, 2005, followed by a performance at Lollapalooza 2005, held in Grant Park in downtown Chicago on July 24, 2005. Their debut album, Ultra Payloaded, was released on May 29, 2007, on Columbia Records, with contributions from artists such as John Frusciante and Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, electronic dance producers Hybrid, former Red Hot Chili Peppers/Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons, Joy Division/New Order bassist Peter Hook, and Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas. Satellite Party performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 27, 2007. On June 8 they performed at the Download Festival at Donington, UK. On June 29 they performed alongside Pearl Jam, Kings of Leon and Queens of the Stone Age at Rock Werchter, Belgium. They performed at Buzz Beach Ball 3 in Kansas City, Missouri (a concert sponsored by KRBZ), and EndFest 16 in Seattle, Washington. Lollapalooza In 1991, prior to Jane's Addiction dissolving, Farrell, Ted Gardener, and Marc Geiger created the Lollapalooza festival as a farewell tour for Jane's Addiction. From its inception through 1997, and its revival in 2003, the festival toured North America. In 2004, the festival organizers decided to expand the dates to two days per city, but poor ticket sales forced the tour to be canceled. In 2005, Farrell and the William Morris Agency partnered up with Austin, Texas-based company Capital Sports Entertainment (now C3 Presents) and retooled it as a weekend destination festival in Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois. =Kidzapalooza= In 2005, music producer Tor Hyams approached Farrell with the idea of creating a kids' stage with family- friendly fare at Lollapalooza. Kidzapalooza came to be that year, produced by Hyams and continues to this day with guests like Slash, Patti Smith and LeAnn Rimes appearing in the lineup of artists. =PurimPalooza 2006= In 2006, Farrell performed at Purimpalooza, which celebrates the Jewish holiday of Purim. It was a concert for all ages and presented different Jewish musical groups. It took place in Ruby Skye in San Francisco, and featured bands including Moshav, Chutzpah, and Matisyahu. Work outside music Farrell has also made a docudrama titled Gift released in 1993 which featured various songs by Farrell and included Farrell's then-girlfriend Casey Niccoli. Gift was released to VHS home video by Warner Bros but never released to DVD. He joined forces with Tom Morello and his Axis of Justice tour to raise money for the homeless in Los Angeles and together they both physically removed debris in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to assist local musicians. They also fund-raised for \\"Road Recovery\\" a New York non-profit organization which helps young people battling with addiction and other adversities. Farrell is an environmentalist. He met with British prime minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street on January 31, 2007, to discuss global warming. He presented Blair with a CD of the Satellite Party track \\"Woman in the Window\\". He worked with Global Cool in 2007 to help promote green living. Farrell has worked to bring music festivals to Israel, including Lollapalooza, and Jane's Addiction itself has performed in Israel. However, the Lollapalooza event fell through, with the organizers citing financial concerns and lack of talent willing to perform in Israel. Farrell starred and sang at a \\"Stand with Israel\\" party held at 7 World Trade Center, just outside Ground Zero in New York City.

Established in 1874, the institution was the home and provided the impetus for the Chautauqua movement that became popular in the US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Chautauqua Institution Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was further designated a National Historic Landmark. History Chautauqua was founded in 1874 by inventor Lewis Miller and Methodist Bishop John Heyl Vincent as a teaching camp for Sunday-school teachers. The teachers would arrive by steamboat on Chautauqua Lake, disembark at Palestine Park and begin a course of Bible study that used the Park to teach the geography of the Holy Land. The institution has operated each summer since then, gradually expanding its season length and program offerings in the arts, education, religion, and music. It offers educational activities to the public during the season, with public events including popular entertainment, theater, symphony, ballet, opera, and visual arts exhibitions. The institution also offers a variety of recreational activities, plus a community education program called Special Studies along with residential programs of intensive study provided for students aiming for professional careers who audition for admittance into Chautauqua's Schools of Performing and Visual Arts. The physical setting of the institution defined its development as an assembly. The grounds are on the west shoreline of upper Chautauqua Lake. The early tent-camp assembly gave way to cottages and rooming houses, and then hotels, inns and eventually condominiums. Founder Lewis Miller's daughter, Mina Miller Edison (wife of inventor Thomas Edison) offered literary classes in Fort Myers, Florida, through the Valinda Society. After completing courses, students were given Chautauqua diplomas. In 1973, the National Park Service added the Institution to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1989, the Department of the Interior designated it a National Historic Landmark District consisting of most of the Institution property between NY 394, formerly NY 17J, the lake and (roughly) Lowell and North Avenues. and Institution programs Every summer during its nine- week season, Chautauqua Institution provides an interesting array of programs including fine and performing arts, lectures, worship services, and religious programs, as well as recreational activities. Nearly 100,000 visitors come to Chautauqua to participate in these programs and events annually. Summer admission to Chautauqua is by \\"gate ticket,\\" which allows entrance into the grounds, use of Smith Memorial Library, use of public beaches and parks, and attendance at lectures and concerts. There is an additional charge for some courses, for films shown at the Chautauqua Cinema, for opera and theater tickets, and use of the tennis courts and golf courses. Cottages and rooms are available for long or short term rental. =Weekly programs= Singer Capathia Jenkins and conductor Stuart Chafetz perform with the Orchestra on the fourth of July. Programs offered during the week at Chautauqua include devotional services and a lecture on a social, political, or academic issue in the morning, a religious or political topic in the afternoon, and a night of entertainment as the evening program. This evening Amphitheater event may be a symphony concert by the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra, a dance program by the Chautauqua Ballet Company, or a show by an individual guest artist. During most weeks, there is at least one opportunity to catch an opera and a play. Both put on by Chautauqua's resident summer companies. Operas are performed in English at Norton Hall, a 1930s-era, art-deco structure. There are also regularly scheduled organ recitals on the Massey Memorial Organ, student recitals, masterclasses, forums, and seminars for the sophisticated. A broad range of special courses in music, art, dance, drama, and general topics are available. The Chautauqua Schools of Music offers extremely competitive programs with scholarships. George Gershwin visited Chautauqua as a summer refuge to compose parts of his Concerto in F in a small, wooden piano studio. Sundays at Chautauqua feature worship services, both denominational and ecumenical. There is an afternoon Amphitheater program, such as a military band or student dance program. On Sundays, entrance to the Institution grounds is free. Fireworks above Chautauqua Lake on the fourth of July =Special events= There is an annual program held on the first Tuesday of each August called \\"Old First Night.\\" The event is the \\"birthday party\\" for the institution, marking the anniversary of the opening of the first season in 1874. Several of the Chautauqua facilities will host fundraisers, including the Old First Night Run, a fun run around the grounds, hosted by the Chautauqua Sports Club, a lip-sync contest called Air Band hosted by the Chautauqua Boys' and Girls' Club, and a bake sale hosted by the Chautauqua Children's Club. All money raised goes to the Chautauqua Fund. Another Chautauqua favorite is the Fourth of July show at the Amphitheater specializing in patriotic-themed music followed by area fireworks viewed from the Chautauqua Lake. Occasional town barbecues at the town square (called Bestor Plaza) and weekly sailboat races are part of the overall unique Chautauqua experience. =Children's programs= The Children's School, established in 1921, is a developmental preschool for youth ages 3–5 and was a pioneering program in the field of nursery-school education. The program consists of social, recreational, and educational activities that often incorporate other Chautauqua programs in the areas of music, drama, art, and recreation. The Chautauqua Boys and Girls Club is one of the oldest day camps in the United States, founded in 1893. While parents are engaging in various activities around the grounds, their children meet in a special area by the lake and participate in sports, art, and recreational games, such as volleyball, sailing, swimming, field games, and pottery. =Institution facilities= The institution's grounds, located between New York State Route 394 and Chautauqua Lake, include public buildings, administrative offices, a library, movie theater, bookstore, hotel, condominiums, inns, rooming houses, and many private cottages available for rent during the season. There are about 400 year-round residents, but the population can increase up to 7,500 guests per day during the summer season. The Institution is mostly a pedestrian community with bikes and scooters widely used along with a 12-mph speed limit for cars when authorized to be on the grounds. There are several parking lots located on the periphery that visitors utilize and then walk or bike into the institution. * The 4,000-seat Amphitheater was demolished in September 2016 to make way for a new theater-style structure, paying homage to the old structure. The new 4,500-seat Amphitheater, completed during the 2016–17 off-season, in time for the institution's 2017 season, features modern amenities and facilities and improved accessibility. This project caused some controversy due to historic nature of the old facility. Athenaeum Hotel * The Athenaeum Hotel located on the grounds is the only hotel owned and operated by the institution. The 156-room hotel, said to be the largest wooden building in the eastern United States, was built in the Second Empire style in 1881. It has a two-story porch supported by narrow columns, with a central, mansard- covered tower. Although the number of hotel rooms has steadily declined on the grounds in the past thirty years, there has been a corresponding growth in condominiums. *Palestine Park is a walk-around, landscaped, geographically scaled map of Palestine showing the general contour of the area, including mountains, valleys, bodies of water and the cities in their correct geographical locations, that existed in the first century CE. Throughout the week, there are multiple tours to discuss the historical and religious significance of this world-famous area. The Miller Bell Tower, drawing of which is the logo of the Chautauqua Institution *The Elizabeth S. Lenna Hall is 8,000 square foot recital and rehearsal hall, dedicated in 1993. This facility was the first significant program facility to be built at the Chautauqua Institution in 65 years. The building serves as the rehearsal facility for the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra and Music School Festival Orchestra and as a recital hall for chamber music, voice and piano. *The Lewis Miller Cottage was built in 1874 as the residence of Lewis Miller, founder and leader of the Chautauqua movement. It was named a National Historic Landmark in 1965 for its association with Miller. =The Chautauqua Prize = The Chautauqua Prize is an annual American literary award established by the Chautauqua Institution in 2012. The winner receives and all travel and expenses for a one-week summer residency at Chautauqua. It is a \\"national prize that celebrates a book of fiction or literary/narrative nonfiction that provides a richly rewarding reading experience and honors the author for a significant contribution to the literary arts.\\" = Chautauqua Declaration = The Chautauqua Declaration is an annual declaration made at the Chautauqua Institution supporting international efforts to bring human rights violators to justice. The first declaration occurred following a meeting of current and former international chief prosecutors of international criminal tribunals and special courts in 2007. The declaration marked the 100th anniversary of the Hague Convention of 1907 and included prosecutors from the Nuremberg trials through to the International Criminal Court. In August 2017, the Tenth Chautauqua Declaration was made, signed by prosecutors from the International Criminal Court, International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Special Tribunal for Lebanon, Special Court for Sierra Leone and the Khmer Rouge Tribunal. The Chautauqua movement In the late 19th century, following the model of the Chautauqua Institution, the Chautauqua movement spread throughout the United States and was highly popular until the start of World War II. By the mid-1920s, when circuit Chautauquas were at their peak, they appeared in over 10,000 communities to audiences of more than 45 million. The movement combined several concepts prevalent in the post-civil war US, including: *The Lyceum movement which attempted to raise the level of public education with lectures, readings, and entertainment with goals of life long learning and self-improvement. *Camp meetings and revivals which used outdoor gatherings *Sunday School for the purpose of religious education. The ideals of the Chautauqua Institution spread throughout the United States through many Independent Chautauqua assemblies. Popping up were a series of traveling Chautauqua meetings, which incorporated many of the program's components, including lectures, music, nondenominational religious studies, and a focus on current issues. Several Independent Chautauquas have survived into the 21st century. The Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle (CLSC), founded in 1878 by Vincent, is one of America's oldest continuously operating book clubs. It was founded to promote self-learning and study, particularly among those unable to attend higher institutions of learning. Six to nine books are added to the reading list each year, with authors generally coming to Chautauqua to discuss their writing and to talk with readers. Famous visitors The Chautauqua Institution has been visited by political figures, celebrities, artists, musicians, scientists, and many others. Since its founding in 1874, the Institution has been visited by four sitting United States presidents including Ulysses S. Grant (1875), Theodore Roosevelt (1905), Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1936), and Bill Clinton (1996). It was at the Chautauqua Institution Amphitheater that Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed a crowd of more than 12,000 with his historic “I hate war” speech in 1936. Future President Garfield visited in 1880 and future President McKinley visited Chautquaua Institution when he was the governor of Ohio in 1895. The Institution has been visited by other historically notable figures including Booker T. Washington, Susan B. Anthony, Amelia Earhart, Thurgood Marshall and Eric Foner. Celebrities from the performing arts who performed at Chautauqua include John Philip Sousa, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald and contemporary artists such as Rhiannon Giddens, Leann Rimes, Jimmie Johnson, Toby Keith, and Clay Aiken.

Biography Born of good family in Thessalonica, cites Philostorg. H. E. ix. 14. he was elected by the Arians to the bishopric of Constantinople. cites Socr. H. E. iv. 14; Soz. H. E. vi. 13. The opinion of the populace, however, were much divided. cites Philostorg. H. E. ix. 10. The orthodox party chose Evagrius for their bishop, and he was ordained by Eustathius, the deposed bishop of Antioch. This was the signal for a furious outburst from the Arians. Both Eustathius and Evagrius were banished by the emperor Valens, and their followers bitterly persecuted. cites Socr. H. E. iv. 14, 16; Soz. H. E. vi. 13, 14. Soon after his accession, Demophilus went to Cyzicus with Dorotheus, or Theodorus, of Heraclea to procure the election of an Arian bishop, which was left vacant since the banishment of Eunomius. Nevertheless, the people of Cyzicus refused to acknowledge them until they had anathematized Aetius, Eunomius, and their followers. They were then permitted to ordain a bishop chosen by the people. The bishop who was ordained straightway and clearly taught the consubstantial faith. cites Philostorg. H. E. ix. 13. In 380 emperor Theodosius I made the patriarchate of Demophilus memorable. Theodosius offered to confirm him in his see, if he would accept the Nicene Creed. Demophilus refused, and was immediately ordered to give up his churches. He then called his followers together and retired, with Lucius of Alexandria and others, to a church outside of the city walls. cites Socr. H. E. v. 7. The churches of Constantinople, which had for forty years been in Arian hands, were now restored to the orthodox; and similarly in other cities. It was in fact a re- establishment of Catholicism. Philostorgius cites Philostorg. H. E. ix. 19 adds that Demophilus went to his own city, Berea; however this must have been some time afterwards, or he must have returned from exile, for he represented the Arian party at the synod in Constantinople in 383. cites Socr. H. E. v. 10; Soz. H. E. vii. 12. The same writer says that Demophilus was wont to throw everything into confusion, especially the doctrines of the Church, and quotes from a sermon at Constantinople, in which he spoke of the human nature of the Saviour as lost in the divine, as a glass of milk when poured into the sea. cites Philostorg.

The dogs were known in German as , meaning Rottweil butchers' dogs, because their main use was to herd livestock and pull carts laden with butchered meat to market. This continued until the mid-19th century when railways replaced droving. Although still used to herd stock in many parts of the world, Rottweilers are now also used as search and rescue dogs, guard dogs, and police dogs.Adolf Pienkoss, The Rottweiler, 3rd ed., Borken, Germany: Internationale Föderation der Rottweilerfreunde, 2008. History Rottweiler memorial in Rottweil According to the FCI Standard, the Rottweiler is considered to be one of the oldest dog breeds. Its origin goes back to Roman times. These dogs were kept as herder or driving dogs. They marched over the Alps with the Roman legions, protecting the humans and driving their cattle. In the region of Rottweil, these dogs met and mixed with the native dogs in a natural crossing. The main task of the Rottweiler now became the driving and guarding of the herds of cattle and the defence of their masters and their property. This breed acquired its name from the old free city of Rottweil and was known as the \\"Rottweil butcher’s dog\\". The butchers bred this type of dog purely for performance and usefulness. In due course, a first rate watch and driving dog evolved which could also be used as a draught dog.Manfred Schanzle, Studies in The Breed History of The Rottweiler. DVM thesis, University of Munich, 1969. The buildup to World War I saw a great demand for police dogs, which led to a revival of interest in the Rottweiler. During the First and Second World Wars, Rottweilers saw service in various roles, including as messenger, ambulance, draught, and guard dogs. The Deutscher Rottweiler-Klub (DRK, German Rottweiler Club), the first Rottweiler club in Germany, was founded on 13 January 1914, and followed by the creation of the Süddeutscher Rottweiler-Klub (SDRK, South German Rottweiler Club) on 27 April 1915 and eventually became the IRK (International Rottweiler Club). The DRK counted around 500 Rottweilers, and the SDRK 3,000 Rottweilers. The goals of the two clubs were different. The DRK aimed to produce working dogs and did not emphasise the morphology of the Rottweiler. The various German Rottweiler Clubs amalgamated to form the Allgemeiner Deutscher Rottweiler Klub (ADRK, General German Rottweiler Club) in 1921. This was officially recorded in the register of clubs and associations at the district court of Stuttgart on 27 January 1924.Pienkoss, 2008. The ADRK is recognised worldwide as the home club of the Rottweiler. In 1931, the Rottweiler was officially recognised by the American Kennel Club.\\"Get to Know the Rottweiler\\", 'The American Kennel Club', Retrieved 29 May 2014 In 1936, Rottweilers were exhibited in Britain at Crufts. In 1966, a separate register was opened for the breed. In fact, in the mid-1990s, the popularity of the Rottweiler reached an all-time high, with it being the most registered dog by the American Kennel Club. In 2017, the American Kennel Club ranked the Rottweiler as the eighth-most popular purebred dog in the United States. Technical description The Fédération Cynologique Internationale gives the following description of the Rottweiler standard: \\"Rottweiler breeders aim at a dog of abundant strength, black coated with clearly defined rich tan markings, whose powerful appearance does not lack nobility and which is exceptionally well suited to being a companion, service, rescue and working dog.\\" This breed is all about balance, endurance, proportionality, intelligence and strength. The various standards in place for the Rottweiler's physical appearance specify these characteristics. Anatomy of the Rottweiler # Head (eyes) # Snout (teeth, tongue) # Dewlap (throat, neck skin) # Shoulder # Elbow # Forefeet # Highest Point of the Rump # Legs (thighs and hips) # Hock # Hind feet # Withers # Stifle # Paws # Tail =Head= The skull is of medium length, relatively broad between the ears. The forehead line is moderately arched as seen from the side, with the occipital bone well developed without being conspicuous. The stop is relatively strong. Frontal groove not too deep. The Rottweiler nose is well developed, more broad than round, with relatively large nostrils and always black. The muzzle should appear neither elongated nor shortened in relation to the cranial region. The ratio between the length of the muzzle and the length of the skull is about 1 to 1.5. The nasal bridge is straight, broad at the base and moderately tapered. The lips are black and close fitting with the corner of the mouth not visible. The gums should be black, or as dark as possible. Both the upper and lower jaws are strong and broad. According to the FCI Standard Rottweilers should have strong and complete dentition (42 teeth) with scissor bite, the upper incisors closely overlapping the lower incisors. The zygomatic arches should be pronounced (but not exaggerated). Upper and lower jaw strong and broad. Strong, complete dentition (42 teeth) with scissor bite, the upper incisors overlapping the lower incisors. The eyes should be of medium size, almond-shaped and dark brown in colour. The eyelids are close fitting and should not droop. The ears are medium-sized, pendant, triangular, wide apart, and set high on the head. With the ears laid forward close to the head, the skull appears to be broadened. The skin on the head is tight fitting overall. When the dog is alert, the forehead may be slightly wrinkled. Faults: Hound- type head. Narrow, light too short, long, coarse or excessively molossoid head; excessively broad skull, (lack of stop, too little stop or too strong stop). Very deep frontal groove. Foreface long, pointed or too short muzzle (any muzzle shorter than 40 percent of the length of the head is too short). split nose; Roman nose (convex nasal bridge) or dish-faced (concave nasal bridge); acquiline nose, pale or spotted nose (butterfly nose). Pincer bite. Molars of the underjaw not standing in one line. Severe Faults: Too molossoid type and heavy general appearance. =Neck= The neck is strong, of fair length, well-muscled, slightly arched, clean, free from throatiness, without excessive dewlap. =Body= The back is straight, strong and firm. The loins are short, strong and deep. The croup is broad, of medium length, and slightly rounded, neither flat nor falling away. The chest is roomy, broad and deep (approximately 50% of the shoulder height) with a well-developed forechest and well sprung ribs. The flanks are not tucked up. =Tail= The FCI 2018 Standard states: Historically the tail was traditionally docked at the first or second joint. However, docking is now banned in most countries and this is reflected in the FCI Country of Origin Breed Standard. Although once \\"preferred\\" in early Standards, in 2018 the FCI Standard was amended to classify the Natural Bob Tail (aka \\"Stumpy\\") as a \\"Disqualifying Fault\\" along with \\"kink tail, ring-tail, with strong lateral deviation.\\" =Limbs= When seen from the front, the front legs are straight and not placed close to each other. The forearm, seen from the side, stands straight and vertical. The slope of the shoulder blade is about 45 degrees. The shoulders are well laid back. The upper arm is close fitting to the body. The forearm is strongly developed and muscular. Pasterns are slightly springy, strong but not steep. The front feet are round, tight and well arched, the pads hard, nails are short, black and strong. When seen from behind, the rear legs are straight and not too close together. When standing free, obtuse angles are formed between the dog's upper thigh and the hip bone, the upper thigh and the lower thigh, and the lower thigh and metatarsal. The upper thigh is moderately long, broad and strongly muscled. The lower thigh is long, strongly and broadly muscled, sinewy. The hocks are sturdy, well-angulated, not steep. The hind feet are slightly longer than the front feet. Toes are strong, arched, as tight as the front feet. =Gait= According to the FCI Standard: According to the American Kennel Council the traditional gait of a Rottweiler is a trot. Therefore, the Rottweiler is a trotter. Trotting in this breed is by no means a fault and is required. This movement comes naturally to the Rottweiler and should appear as such; any deviation may lead to a disqualification in the show ring. While walking, the Rottweiler's legs, both front and hind, should move in a straight forward and backward manner. As with the straight movement of the legs, the path the Rottweiler moves in should also be straight. The Rottweiler's gait is all about balance and effectiveness as the breed is still used as a herder today. =Coat= The coat consists of an outer coat and an undercoat. The outer coat is of medium length, coarse, dense and flat. The undercoat should be present on the neck and thighs. The undercoat must not show through the outer coat. Rottweilers living in hot climates may have acclimatised and may be missing the undercoat. Rottweiler coats tend to be low maintenance, although they experience heavy shedding before their seasons (females) or seasonally (males). According to American Kennel Club breed standards, a Rottweiler's coat is short and straight. A coat that is long or wavy is considered a flaw to the AKC. =Colour and markings= The colour and markings of a Rottweiler are very distinctive. According to the FCI Standard a Rottweiler is always \\"black with clearly defined markings of a rich tan on the cheeks, muzzle, throat, chest and legs, as well as over both eyes and under the base of the tail\\"\\"Rottweiler breed standard\\" (PDF). FCI. Retrieved 7 April 2019. The American Kennel Club calls for mahogany or rust-colored markings that do not take up more than ten percent of the dog's body color. All Rottweilers standard to AKC specifications have one mahogany dot above each eye on the inner brow ridge, on the cheeks, one strip on each side of the snout; cheek markings do not cross over the bridge of the nose, the top of the nose should remain black. The markings on the face should move down onto the dog's throat. On the chest, a Rottweiler will have two downward-facing triangular marks. On each front leg, the marks will stretch from the forearm to the toes. On the hind legs, the markings will begin on the inside and move outward onto the stifle, then out onto the hock stretching to the toes as well. AKC standards recognize that the black base color is not completely voided on the rear pasterns. There is a patch of rust or mahogany underneath the tail that resembles a triangle as well. A thin strip of black should be present on each of the Rottweiler's toes. =Size= Technically a \\"medium / large\\" breed, according to the FCI standard the Rottweiler stands 61–69 cm (24–27 in) at the withers for males, 56–63 cm (22–25 in) for females, and the weight must be between 50 and 60 kg (110 and 132 lbs) for males and 35 and 48 kg (77 and 105 lbs) for females. Weight must be relative to height. Temperament A litter of seven Rottweiler puppies at 3 weeks old In the breed standard published by Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 2018, the Rottweiler's behaviour/temperament should be: In the American Kennel Club's \\"Official Standard of the Rottweiler,\\" the Rottweiler's temperament should be: According to the American Rottweiler Club: Rottweilers are a powerful breed with well-developed genetic herding and guarding instincts. Potentially dangerous behaviour in Rottweilers usually results from irresponsible ownership, abuse, neglect, or lack of socialisation and training. However, the exceptional strength of the Rottweiler is an additional risk factor not to be neglected. It is for this reason that breed experts declare that formal training and extensive socialisation are essential for all Rottweilers. According to the AKC, Rottweilers love their owners and may behave in a clownish manner toward family and friends, but they are also protective of their territory and do not welcome strangers until properly introduced. Obedience training and socialization are required. One study published in 2008 found that male Rottweilers have higher confidence, sharpness, and defense and play drives than females. A 2008 study surveying breed club members found that while Rottweilers were average in aggressiveness (bites or bite attempts) towards owners and other dogs, it indicated they tend to be more aggressive than average toward strangers. This aggression appears correlated with watchdog and territorial instincts. In the Rottweiler Handbook, Joan H. Walker states that \\"The Rottweiler is very territorial\\", meaning that the owner will have to regularly work with the dog to control its territorial aggressiveness. Working style A Rottweiler Primarch Velvet Delite herding sheep According to the American Kennel Club,American Kennel Club, AKC Herding Regulations Rottweilers have a natural gathering style with a strong desire to control. They generally show a loose eye and have a great amount of force while working well off the stock. They make much use of their ability to intimidate. The Rottweiler often carries the head on an even plane with the back, or carries the head up but with the neck and shoulders lowered. Some females lower the entire front end slightly when using their eyes. Males also do this when working far off the stock in an open field. This is rarely seen in males when working in confined spaces such as stock yards. The Rottweiler has a reasonably good natural balance, force-barks when necessary, and when working cattle uses a very intimidating charge. There is a natural change in forcefulness when herding sheep. When working cattle, it may use its body and shoulders and for this reason should be used on horned stock with caution. The Rottweiler, when working cattle, searches out the dominant animal and challenges it. Upon proving its control over that animal it settles back and tends to its work. Some growers have found that Rottweilers are especially suited to move stubborn stock that simply ignore Border Collies, Kelpies, and others. Rottweilers use their bodies to physically force the stubborn animal to do its bidding if necessary. When working with sheep, the Rottweiler shows a gathering/fetching style and reams directions easily. It drives sheep with ease. In some cases, Rottweilers have begun herding cattle without any experience at all. If worked on the same stock for any length of time, the Rottweiler tends to develop a bond with the stock and will become quite affectionate with them as long as they do as it directs.\\"Breed Feature: Bernese Mountain Dogs, Leonbergers & Rottweilers\\", National Dog – The Ringleader Way, vol. 12, nos. 1&2 (Jan/Feb 2009), p. 12. The Rottweiler is also exceptionally suited for and is commonly used in many dog sports including Agility and Schutzhund. Health Rottweiler Rottweilers are a relatively healthy, disease-free breed. As with most large breeds, hip dysplasia can be a problem. For this reason, the various Rottweiler breed clubs have had X-ray testing regimens in place for many years. Osteochondritis dissecans, a condition affecting the shoulder joints, can also be a problem due to the breed's rapid growth rate. A reputable breeder will have the hips and elbows of all breeding stock X-rayed and read by a recognised specialist, and will have the paperwork to prove it. They will also have certificates that their breeding animals do not have entropion or ectropion and that they have full and complete dentition with a scissor bite. As with any breed, hereditary conditions occur in some lines. The Rottweiler is very prone to osteosarcoma, which is among the most common causes of early death in Rottweilers. For unknown reasons, Rottweilers are more susceptible than other breeds to become infected with parvovirus, a highly contagious and deadly disease of puppies and young dogs. If overfed or under-exercised, Rottweilers are prone to obesity. Some of the consequences of obesity can be very serious, including arthritis, breathing difficulties, diabetes, heart failure, reproductive problems, skin disease, reduced resistance to disease and overheating caused by the thick jacket of fat under the skin.Les Price, Rottweilers: An Owner's Companion. New York: Macmillan,1991, p. 114. Breed surveys in the US, UK and Denmark, and UK vet data puts the average lifespan of Rottweilers at 8 to 10 years. \\"n=105 median=8.0 IQR=5.5–10.2\\" As with the vast majority of large- breed dogs, Rottweilers are also predisposed to dilated cardiomyopathy. Media portrayal The portrayal of Rottweilers as vicious or malevolently aggressive dogs in several fictional films and TV series, most notably in The Omen, along with sensationalist press coverage, has created a negative image of the breed. Some films and television shows, such as Lethal Weapon 3, the 1998 film Half Baked, and the hit HBO show Entourage, have portrayed Rottweilers in a positive light. They are also featured in the children's book series Good Dog, Carl by Alexandra Day. In an event widely reported by the media, a two-year-old UK Rottweiler named Jake owned by Liz Maxted-Bluck was recognised for his bravery by the RSPCA. The dog was out walking with his owner when they heard screams. Jake chased off a man as he molested a woman on Hearsall Common, Coventry, in July 2009. He located the attacker and his victim in thick scrub, chased off the attacker, led his owner to the scene, then stood guard over the victim until the police arrived. The attacker was convicted of serious sexual assault and jailed for four years. Jake was nominated by police for the bravery award and medallion after the incident. Det. Con Clive Leftwich, from the Coventry police station, said: \\"From our point of view Jake the Rottweiler stopped a serious sexual assault from becoming even worse.\\" Gallery File:Year Old Rottweiler.jpgOne-year-old Rottweiler File:\\"Prince\\" (7369763074).jpgMale Rottweiler File:03 Snow Bunny Talitha Rottweiler.jpgFemale Rottweiler File:Rottweiler Aaron.jpg10-year-old Rottweiler File:Dog rottweiler.jpg Rottweiler File:Rottweiler portrait.jpgA close-up headshot File:Rottweiler-Head.jpgHeadshot of a Rottweiler File:Rottweiler kopf 2.jpgAn oblique head shot References Further reading * * Brace, Andrew H.

Hermits are a part of several sections of various religions and this concept has garnered significant attention and importance. Description In Christianity, the term was originally applied to a Christian who lives the eremitic life out of a religious conviction, namely the Desert Theology of the Old Testament (i.e., the 40 years wandering in the desert that was meant to bring about a change of heart). In the Christian tradition the eremitic lifeMarina Miladinov, Margins of Solitude: Eremitism in Central Europe between East and West (Zaghreb: Leykam International, 2008) is an early form of monastic living that preceded the monastic life in the cenobium. In chapter 1, the Rule of St Benedict lists hermits among four kinds of monks. In the Roman Catholic Church, in addition to hermits who are members of religious institutes, the Canon law (canon 603) recognizes also diocesan hermits under the direction of their bishop as members of the consecrated life. The same is true in many parts of the Anglican Communion, including the Episcopal Church in the United States, although in the canon law of the Episcopal Church they are referred to as \\"solitaries\\" rather than \\"hermits\\". Often, both in religious and secular literature, the term \\"hermit\\" is used loosely for any Christian living a secluded prayer-focused life, and sometimes interchangeably with anchorite/anchoress, recluse and \\"solitary\\". Other religions, for example, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam (Sufism), and Taoism, also have hermits in the sense of individuals living an ascetic form of life. In modern colloquial usage, \\"hermit\\" denotes anyone living apart from the rest of society, or simply participating in fewer social events, for any reason. Etymology The word hermit comes from the Latin ĕrēmīta,eremita, Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, on Perseus project the latinisation of the Greek ἐρημίτης (erēmitēs), \\"of the desert\\",ἐρημίτης, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus project which in turn comes from ἔρημος (erēmos),ἔρημος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus project signifying \\"desert\\", \\"uninhabited\\", hence \\"desert- dweller\\"; adjective: \\"eremitic\\". History =Tradition= Eremitic cave in Spain In the common Christian tradition the first known Christian hermit in Egypt was Paul of Thebes (fl. 3rd century), hence also called \\"St. Paul the first hermit\\". Antony of Egypt (fl. 4th century), often referred to as \\"Antony the Great\\", is perhaps the most renowned of all the very early Christian hermits owing to the biography by Athanasius of Alexandria. An antecedent for Egyptian eremiticism may have been the Syrian solitary or \\"son of the covenant\\" (Aramaic bar qəyāmā) who undertook special disciplines as a Christian. Christian hermits in the past have often lived in isolated cells or hermitages, whether a natural cave or a constructed dwelling, situated in the desert or the forest. People sometimes sought them out for spiritual advice and counsel. Some eventually acquired so many disciples that they no longer had physical solitude. Some early Christian Desert Fathers wove baskets to exchange for bread. In medieval times hermits were also found within or near cities where they might earn a living as a gate keeper or ferryman. In the 10th century, a rule for hermits living in a monastic community was written by Grimlaicus. In the 11th century, the life of the hermit gained recognition as a legitimate independent pathway to salvation. Many hermits in that century and the next came to be regarded as saints.Tom Licence, Hermits and Recluses in English Society 950–1200, (Oxford, 2011),p.36. From the Middle Ages and down to modern times, eremitical monasticism has also been practiced within the context of religious institutes in the Christian West. In the Catholic Church the Carthusians and Camaldolese arrange their monasteries as clusters of hermitages where the monks live most of their day and most of their lives in solitary prayer and work, gathering only briefly for communal prayer and only occasionally for community meals and recreation. The Cistercian, Trappist and Carmelite orders, which are essentially communal in nature, allow members who feel a calling to the eremitic life, after years living in the cenobium or community of the monastery, to move to a cell suitable as a hermitage on monastery grounds. There have also been many hermits who chose that vocation as an alternative to other forms of monastic life. =Anchorites= The term \\"anchorite\\" (from the Greek anachōreō, signifying \\"to withdraw\\", \\"to depart into the country outside the circumvallate city\\") is often used as a synonym for hermit, not only in the earliest written sources but throughout the centuries.Oxford English Dictionary. \\"A person who has withdrawn or secluded themself from the world; usually one who has done so for religious reasons, a recluse, a hermit.\\" Yet the anchoritic life, while similar to the eremitic life, can also be distinct from it. Anchorites lived the religious life in the solitude of an \\"anchorhold\\" (or \\"anchorage\\"), usually a small hut or \\"cell\\", typically built against a church.McAvoy, LA., Anchoritic Traditions of Medieval Europe, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2010, p. 2. The door of an anchorage tended to be bricked up in a special ceremony conducted by the local bishop after the anchorite had moved in. Medieval churches survive that have a tiny window (\\"squint\\") built into the shared wall near the sanctuary to allow the anchorite to participate in the liturgy by listening to the service and to receive Holy Communion. Another window looked out into the street or cemetery, enabling charitable neighbors to deliver food and other necessities. Clients seeking the anchorite's advice might also use this window to consult them.Dyas, E., Edden, V. and Ellis, R., Approaching Medieval English Anchoritic and Mystical Texts, DS Brewer, 2005, pp. 10-12. Contemporary Christian life =Catholicism= Catholics who wish to live in eremitic monasticism may live that vocation as a hermit: * in an eremitical order (for example Carthusian, Camaldolese), but in both cases under obedience to their religious superior (see below), or as an Oblate affiliated with the Camaldolese or * as a diocesan hermit under the canonical direction of their bishop (canon 603, see below). There are also lay people who informally follow an eremitic lifestyle and live mostly as solitaries.Dubay, T., And You Are Christ's: The Charism of Virginity and the Celibate Life, Ignatius Press, 1987, Ch. 9. Not all the Catholic lay members that feel that it is their vocation to dedicate themselves to God in a prayerful solitary life perceive it as a vocation to some form of consecrated life. An example of this is life as a Poustinik, an Eastern Catholic expression of eremitic living that is finding adherents also in the West. Eremitic members of religious institutes Church of the hermitage \\"Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden\\" in Warfhuizen, Netherlands In the Catholic Church, the institutes of consecrated life have their own regulations concerning those of their members who feel called by God to move from the life in community to the eremitic life, and have the permission of their religious superior to do so. The Code of Canon Law (1983) contains no special provisions for them. They technically remain a member of their institute of consecrated life and thus under obedience to their religious superior. The Carthusian and Camaldolese orders of monks and nuns preserve their original way of life as essentially eremitical within a cenobitical context, that is, the monasteries of these orders are in fact clusters of individual hermitages where monks and nuns spend their days alone with relatively short periods of prayer in common. Other orders that are essentially cenobitical, notably the Trappists, maintain a tradition under which individual monks or nuns who have reached a certain level of maturity within the community may pursue a hermit lifestyle on monastery grounds under the supervision of the abbot or abbess. Thomas Merton was among the Trappists who undertook this way of life. Diocesan hermits The earliest form of Christian eremitic or anchoritic living preceded that as a member of a religious institute, since monastic communities and religious institutes are later developments of the monastic life. Bearing in mind that the meaning of the eremitic vocation is the Desert Theology of the Old Testament, it may be said that the desert of the urban hermit is that of their heart, purged through kenosis to be the dwelling place of God alone. So as to provide for men and women who feel a vocation to the eremitic or anchoritic life without being or becoming a member of an institute of consecrated life, but desire its recognition by the Roman Catholic Church as a form of consecrated life nonetheless, the Code of Canon Law 1983 legislates in the Section on Consecrated Life (canon 603) as follows: Canon 603 §2 lays down certain requirements for those who feel a vocation to the kind of eremitic life that is recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as a form of consecrated life. These anchorites usually are referred to as \\"diocesan hermits\\". The Catechism of the Catholic Church of 11 October 1992 (§§918–921) comments on the eremitic life as follows: Catholic Church norms for the consecrated eremitic and anchoritic life do not include corporal works of mercy. Nevertheless, every hermit, like every Christian, is bound by the law of charity and therefore ought to respond generously, as his or her own circumstances permit, when faced with a specific need for corporal works of mercy. Hermits, like every Christian, are also bound by the law of work. If they are not financially independent, they may engage in cottage industries or be employed part-time in jobs that respect the call for them to live in solitude and silence with extremely limited or no contact with other persons. Such outside jobs may not keep them from observing their obligations of the eremitic vocation of stricter separation from the world and the silence of solitude in accordance with canon 603, under which they have made their vow. Although canon 603 makes no provision for associations of hermits, these do exist (for example the \\"Hermits of Bethlehem\\" in Chester NJ and the \\"Hermits of Saint Bruno\\" in the United States; see also lavra, skete).See for instance Bamberg Anne, Ermite reconnu par l’Église. Le c. 603 du code de droit canonique et la haute responsabilité de l’évêque diocésain, in Vie consacrée, 74, 2002, p. 104–118 and Entre théologie et droit canonique : l’ermite catholique face à l’obéissance, in Nouvelle revue théologique, 125, 2003, p. 429–439 or Eremiten und geweihtes Leben. Zur kanonischen Typologie, in Geist und Leben, 78, 2005, p. 313–318. =Anglicanism= Many of the recognised religious communities and orders in the Anglican Communion make provision for certain members to live as hermits, more commonly referred to as solitaries. One Church of England community, the Society of St. John the Evangelist, now has only solitaries in its British congregation. Anglicanism also makes provision for men and women who seek to live a single consecrated life, after taking vows before their local bishop; many who do so live as solitaries. The Handbook of Religious Life, published by the Advisory Council of Relations between Bishops and Religious Communities, contains an appendix governing the selection, consecration, and management of solitaries living outside recognised religious communities. In the Canon Law of the Episcopal Church (United States), those who make application to their diocesan bishop and who persevere in whatever preparatory program the bishop requires, take vows that include lifelong celibacy. They are referred to as solitaries rather than hermits. Each selects a bishop other than their diocesan as an additional spiritual resource and, if necessary, an intermediary. At the start of the twenty-first century the Church of England reported a notable increase in the number of applications from people seeking to live the single consecrated life as Anglican hermits or solitaries. St. Seraphim of Sarov sharing his meal with a bear =Eastern Orthodoxy= In the Orthodox Church and Eastern Rite Catholic Churches, hermits live a life of prayer as well as service to their community in the traditional Eastern Christian manner of the poustinik. The poustinik is a hermit available to all in need and at all times. In the Eastern Christian churches one traditional variation of the Christian eremitic life is the semi- eremitic life in a lavra or skete, exemplified historically in Scetes, a place in the Egyptian desert, and continued in various sketes today including several regions on Mount Athos.

Other religions Two Sadhus, Hindu hermits From a religious point of view, the solitary life is a form of asceticism, wherein the hermit renounces worldly concerns and pleasures. This can be done for many reasons, including: to come closer to the deity or deities they worship or revere, to devote one's energies to self-liberation from saṃsāra, etc. This practice appears also in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sufism. Taoism also has a long history of ascetic and eremitical figures. In the ascetic eremitic life, the hermit seeks solitude for meditation, contemplation, prayer, self-awareness and personal development on physical and mental levels; without the distractions of contact with human society, sex, or the need to maintain socially acceptable standards of cleanliness, dress or communication. The ascetic discipline can also include a simplified diet and/or manual labor as a means of support. =Notable hermits in other religions= Hsu Yun, a renowned Chan Buddhist hermit *Ramana Maharshi, the renowned Hindu philosopher and saint who meditated for several years at and around the hillside temple of Thiruvannamalai in Southern India . * Laozi, who in some traditions spent his final days as a hermit. * U Khandi, religious figure in Burma * Yoshida Kenkō, Japanese author * Zhang Daoling, founder of Tianshi Dao * Hsu Yun, Ch'an Buddhist monk in China. * Hanshan, Buddhist/Taoist hermit and poet. * Lin Bu (林逋), a Song Dynasty poet who spent much of his later life in solitude, while admiring plum blossoms, on a cottage by West Lake in Hangzhou. * The Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism, lived for many years as a hermit in the Carpathian Mountains. * Rabbi Nachman of Bratzlav, the Baal Shem Tov's great-grandson, also spent much time in seclusion and instructed his disciples to set aside at least one hour a day for secluded contemplation and prayer. Some followers of Rabbi Nachman devoted themselves to seclusion, such as Rabbi Shmuel of Dashev and two generations later, Rabbi Abraham Chazan. * Rabbi Yosef Yozel Horowitz, known as the \\"Alter (Elder) of Novardok\\", succeeded his master Rabbi Yisrael Salanter in disseminating the pietistic teachings of the Lithuanian Mussar Movement. He too spent much time in seclusion, included one year during which he confined himself to a sealed room, attended by a few devoted followers. In literature In Orlando Furioso, Angelica meets a hermit * In medieval romances, the knight-errant frequently encounters hermits on his quest. Such a figure, generally a wise old man, would advise him. Knights searching for the Holy Grail, in particular, learn from a hermit the errors they must repent for, and the significance of their encounters, dreams, and visions.Penelope Reed Doob, The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages, pp. 179–81, Evil wizards would sometimes pose as hermits, to explain their presence in the wilds, and to lure heroes into a false sense of security. In Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, both occurred: the knight on a quest met a good hermit, and the sorcerer Archimago took on such a pose.Lewis, C. S., Spenser's Images of Life, p. 87, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1967 These hermits are sometimes also vegetarians for ascetic reasons, as suggested in a passage from Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur: \\"Then departed Gawain and Ector as heavy (sad) as they might for their misadventure (mishap), and so rode till that they came to the rough mountain, and there they tied their horses and went on foot to the hermitage. And when they were (had) come up, they saw a poor house, and beside the chapel a little courtelage (courtyard), where Nacien the hermit gathered worts (vegetables), as he had tasted none other meat (food) of a great while.\\"Sir Thomas Malory, Le Morte d'Arthur 16.3 The practice of vegetarianism may have also existed amongst actual medieval hermits outside of literature. * Hermits appear in a few of the stories of Giovanni Boccaccio's The Decameron. One of the most famous stories, the tenth story of the third day, involves the seduction of a young girl by a hermit in the desert near Gafsa; it was judged to be so obscene that it was not translated into English until the 20th century. * The Three Hermits is a famous short story by Russian author Leo Tolstoy written in 1885 and first published in 1886, with its shock ending, featured the 3 hermits as the titular characters. The main character of Tolstoy's short story \\"Father Sergius\\" is a Russian nobleman who turns to a solitary religious life and becomes a hermit after he learns that his fiancée was a discarded mistress of the czar. * Friedrich Nietzsche, in his influential work Thus Spoke Zarathustra, created the character of the hermit Zarathustra (named after the Zoroastrian prophet Zarathushtra), who emerges from seclusion to extol his philosophy to the rest of humanity.

Ebens and Nitz assailed Chin following a brawl that took place at a strip club in Highland Park, Michigan, where Chin had been celebrating his bachelor party with friends in advance of his upcoming wedding. They apparently assumed Chin was of Japanese descent, and are alleged to have used racial slurs as they attacked him. Ebens and Nitz blamed him for the success of Japan's auto industry, despite the fact that Chin was of Chinese descent. At the time, Metro Detroit was a powder keg of racial animosity toward Asian-Americans, specifically as the penetration of Japanese automotive imports in the U.S. domestic market hastened the decline of Detroit’s Big Three. Resentful workers laid the blame for recent layoffs on Japanese competition. Chin was taken to Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, where a nurse told his childhood friend that \\"he has no chance\\" and that \\"his brain was dead.\\" He died of his injuries four days later. Ebens and Nitz were charged with second-degree murder, but bargained the charges down to manslaughter and pleaded guilty in 1983. They were ordered to pay $3,000 and serve three years' probation, with no jail time. While Ebens and Nitz never denied the brawl, they claimed the fight was not racially motivated and said they did not use racial epithets. The lenient sentence led to a vocal outcry from Asian-Americans. The president of the Detroit Chinese Welfare Council said it amounted to a \\"$3,000 license to kill\\" Chinese Americans. As a result, the case has been viewed as a critical turning point for Asian-American civil rights engagement and a rallying cry for stronger federal hate crime legislation. Early life Chin was born on May 18, 1955, in Guangdong province, China. He was the only child of Bing Hing \\"David\\" Chin (; a.k.a. C.W. Hing) and Lily Chin (née Yee) (). His father earned the right to bring a Chinese bride into the United States through his service in World War II. After Lily suffered a miscarriage in 1949 and was unable to have children, the couple adopted Vincent from a Chinese orphanage in 1961. Throughout most of the 1960s, Chin grew up in Highland Park. In 1971, after the elderly Hing was mugged, the family moved to Oak Park, Michigan. Vincent Chin graduated from Oak Park High School in 1973, going on to study at Control Data Institute. At the time of his death, he was employed as an industrial draftsman at Efficient Engineering, an automotive supplier, as well as working weekends as a waiter at the former Golden Star restaurant in Ferndale, Michigan. He was engaged, and the wedding date set for June 28, 1982. Homicide The fight which would lead to the murder of Vincent Chin started at The Fancy Pants Club, when Chin took umbrage at a remark that Ebens made to a stripper who had just finished dancing at Chin's table (Chin was having a bachelor party, as he was to be married eight days later). According to an interview by Michael Moore for the Detroit Free Press, Ebens told the stripper, \\"Don't pay any attention to those little fuckers, they wouldn't know a good dancer if they'd seen one.\\" Ebens claimed that Chin walked over to Ebens and Michael Nitz and threw a punch at Ebens' jaw without provocation, although witnesses at the ensuing trial testified that Ebens also got up and said, \\"It's because of you little motherfuckers that we're out of work,\\"Article \\"Remembering Vincent Chin\\" on AsianWeek referring to the Japanese auto industry, particularly Chrysler's increased sales of captively- imported Mitsubishi models rebadged and sold under the Dodge and now-defunct Plymouth brands, and Nitz's layoff from Chrysler in 1979, despite the fact that Chin was Chinese, not Japanese. It is disputed whether Ebens uttered other racial slurs. The fight escalated as Nitz shoved Chin in defense of his stepfather, and Chin countered. At the end of the scuffle, both Ebens and Nitz were sprawled on the floor, with Nitz suffering a cut on his head from a thrown chair. Chin and his friends left the room, while a bouncer led Ebens and Nitz to the restroom to clean up the wound. While they were there, Robert Siroskey, one of Chin's friends, came back inside to use the restroom. He apologized for the group, stating that Chin had a few drinks because of his bachelor's party. Ebens and Nitz had also been drinking that night, although not at the club, which did not serve alcohol. Jimmy Choi also reentered the club to look for Siroskey. When Ebens and Nitz left the club, Chin and his friends were still waiting outside for Siroskey. Chin challenged Ebens and Nitz to continue the fight in the parking lot, at which point Ebens retrieved a baseball bat from Nitz' car and chased Chin and Choi out of the parking lot. Ebens and Nitz searched the neighborhood for 20 to 30 minutes and even paid another man 20 dollars to help look for Chin, before finding him at a McDonald's restaurant. Chin tried to escape, but was held by Nitz while Ebens repeatedly bludgeoned Chin with a baseball bat until Chin's head cracked open. A policeman who witnessed the beating said Ebens was swinging the bat like he was swinging “for a home run”. When rushed to Henry Ford Hospital, he was unconscious and died after four days in a coma on June 23, 1982. Ebens was arrested for the initial assault. After Vincent Chin's death, Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz were charged with second-degree murder. Legal history =Inaction by the government and advocacy groups= At the time, government officials, politicians, and several prominent legal organizations generally dismissed theories of civil rights aspects of the Vincent Chin beating. The local Michigan American Civil Liberties Union and the Detroit chapter of the National Lawyers Guild did not see the connection between civil rights and Chin's death.Detroit: Race Riots, Racial Conflicts, and Efforts to Bridge the Racial Divide. At first, only a new group called the American Citizens for Justice (ACJ) lent its support to the theory that existing civil rights laws should be applied to Asian Americans. Eventually, the national body of the National Lawyers Guild endorsed its efforts. =State criminal charges= Ebens was arrested and taken into custody at the scene of the crime by two off-duty police officers who had witnessed the beating. Ebens and Nitz were convicted in a county court for manslaughter by Wayne County Circuit Judge Charles Kaufman, after a plea bargain brought the charges down from second- degree murder. They served no jail time, were given three years' probation, fined $3,000 and ordered to pay $780 in court costs. In a response letter to protests from American Citizens for Justice, Kaufman said, \\"These weren't the kind of men you send to jail... You don't make the punishment fit the crime; you make the punishment fit the criminal.\\" =Federal civil rights charges= The verdict angered the Asian American community in the Detroit area and around the country. Journalist Helen Zia and lawyer Liza Chan () led the fight for federal charges, which resulted in the two murderers being accused of two counts of violating Chin's civil rights, under section 245 of title 18 of the United States Code. For these charges, it was not enough that Ebens had injured Chin, but that \\"a substantial motivating factor for the defendant's actions was Mr. Chin's race, color, or national origin, and because Mr. Chin had been enjoying a place of entertainment which serves the public.\\"Defendant's Requested Jury Instruction No. 30, U.S. v. Ebens. Because of possible mitigating factors that could lead to reasonable doubt, such as intoxication leading to the defendant's inability to form the specific intent,Defendant's Requested Jury Instruction No. 18, U.S. v. Ebens. the prosecution merely proving the evidence of uttered racial slurs would not, in itself, be sufficient for conviction.Defendant's Requested Jury Instruction No. 31, U.S. v. Ebens. In addition, the defense found Racine Colwell, the witness who overheard the \\"It's because of you motherfuckers we're out of work\\" remark, to have received some clemency on a jail sentence for a prostitution charge, which suggested that the government might have tried to cut a deal for her testimony.U.S. vs. Ebens transcript, Tuesday, June 19, 1984, pp. 209–211. The 1984 federal civil rights case against the men found Ebens guilty of the second count and sentenced him to 25 years in prison; Nitz was acquitted of both counts. After an appeal, Ebens' conviction was overturned in 1986—a federal appeals court found an attorney improperly coached prosecution witnesses. After a retrial that was moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, due to the publicity the case had received in Detroit, a jury cleared Ebens of all charges in 1987. =Civil suits= A civil suit for the unlawful death of Vincent Chin was settled out of court on March 23, 1987. Michael Nitz was ordered to pay $50,000. Ronald Ebens was ordered to pay $1.5 million, at $200/month for the first two years and 25% of his income or $200/month thereafter, whichever was greater. This represented the projected loss of income from Vincent Chin's engineering position, as well as Lily Chin's loss of Vincent's services as laborer and driver. However, the estate of Vincent Chin would not be allowed to garnish social security, disability, or Ebens' pension from Chrysler, nor could the estate place a lien on Ebens' house. In November 1989, Ebens reappeared in court for a creditor's hearing, where he detailed his finances and reportedly pledged to make good on his debt to the Chin estate. However, in 1997, the Chin estate was forced to renew the civil suit, as it was allowed to do every ten years. With accrued interest and other charges, the adjusted total became $4,683,653.89. Ebens sought in 2015 to have the resulting lien against his house vacated. Aftermath Vincent Chin's mother, Lily Chin Chin was interred in Detroit's Forest Lawn Cemetery. In September 1987, Chin's mother, Lily Chin, moved from Oak Park back to her hometown of Guangzhou, China, in order to avoid being reminded of the tragedy. She returned to the United States for medical treatment in late 2001 and died on June 9, 2002. Prior to her death, Lily Chin had established a scholarship in Vincent's memory, to be administered by American Citizens for Justice. Legacy The attack was considered a hate crime by many, but it predated the passage of hate crime laws in the United States. Nevertheless, during a 1998 House of Representatives hearing on the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1997, Congressman John Conyers, who is an African American, suggested that the problem with making people sufficiently aware of the causes and injustices of Chin's case was that it was a political \\"hot potato\\" that did not get picked up for \\"political reasons\\", with respect to the automobile industry. Chin's case has been cited by some Asian Americans in order to support the idea that they are considered \\"perpetual foreigners\\" in contrast to \\"real\\" Americans who are considered full citizens. Lily Chin stated: \\"What kind of law is this? What kind of justice? This happened because my son is Chinese. If two Chinese killed a white person, they must go to jail, maybe for their whole lives... Something is wrong with this country.\\"Iris Chang. The Chinese in America: A Narrative History. Viking, 2003. 0-670-03123-2. p. 320.

Population In 1910 the population of Clear Lake was estimated at seventy- five and by 1914 had grown to 100. Despite the construction of the Lavon Reservoir in 1954, the estimated number of residents at the community remained at fifty for the period from the 1930s to 1990. History The United States government in 1884 built and operated a distillery on the banks of nearby Clear Lake. A small number of settlers were attracted to the area by the federal project, after which the town of Clear Lake was established in 1890. In 1898 a post office was established but it was discontinued sometime after 1930. The postmaster was Robert L. Palmer. The community was a principal provider of bois d'arc timber for Dallas for several years at the beginning of its existence. Dallas was experimenting with the use of wood to pave its streets but after the project was abandoned many residents left Clear Lake. The community was also on the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway. The land surrounding Clear Lake was subject to seasonal flooding, which destroyed crops even though it was located in the heart of the Blackland Prairie Geography The census enumeration district map of 1940, Collin County E.D. 43-39, shows Clear Lake west of the confluence of Ticky Creek and Pilot Grove Creek which today is submerged in Lavon Lake.

During his career that lasted from 1939 to 1954 he was a world's top middle distance runner, excelling in distances from 1500 to 5000 metres. Slijkhuis began his international sports career shortly after World War II, having competed nationally since 1939. In 1946, he won a silver medal in the 5000 m at the European Championships in Oslo.Wim Slijkhuis. sports- reference.com Two years later he took part in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, and was a favourite to win a medal. In the 5000 m he finished third, behind Belgian Gaston Reiff and the legendary Emil Zátopek; nevertheless Slijkhuis was not satisfied. In the 1500 m, his second event, he could have done better, but started his final sprint to the finish line too late to catch the two leading Swedes, who finished narrowly ahead of him. In spite of this, realising 3:50.4 he equalled his own Dutch record, set two years earlier. Slijkhuis' achievements were overshadowed, however, by the performances of compatriot Fanny Blankers-Koen, who won four gold medals at the same Olympics. In 1950, Slijkhuis did win a major title: the 1500 m at the European championships held in Brussels, with a time of 3:47.2. His personal best at this distance had already been improved to 3:43.8, realised one year earlier in Antwerp and only 0.8 s away from the existing world record at the time. During his career Willem Slijkhuis didn't just run almost everywhere in Europe, but also in New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. He was the first Dutchman who competed in the US Indoor circuit and the first non- American, who ever succeeded in obtaining the US title over one mile. Owing to his stubborn behaviour Slijkhuis sometimes clashed with officials of the Dutch Athletics Federation, who he accused of outrageous interference. On the track however he impressed experts and public with his smooth, steady running style. Especially the English were delighted about his beautiful running style, which they lyrically described as \\"The Poetry of motion\\". His second Olympic participation in the 1952 Summer Olympics ended without any successes. Slijkhuis, who won eleven national titles - including eight in the men's 5000 metres - on track, seven in Cross country running and set thirty Dutch records, ended his career in 1954 due to injuries.

She is also described in the Prose Edda (Gylfaginning) as \\"a giantess in Jötunheimar\\" and as the mother of three monsters: the wolf Fenrir, the Midgard serpent Jörmungand, and the ruler of the dead Hel.

Administratively it belongs to the municipality of Portoferraio in the province of Livorno, Italy. The island has an area of , it is approximately wide at its widest point and is long; the coasts are steep, and extend for . The island is a state nature reserve and forms part of the Tuscan Archipelago National Park. Much of the island's fame is derived from the fact that it provides the setting for part of the novel The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas. History The history of the island begins with the Iron Age. The Etruscans exploited the forests of oak needed to fuel the bloomeries of the mainland where the iron ore of Elba's mines was melted. The Greeks gave Montecristo its oldest known name, Oglasa or Ocrasia, after the yellowish colour of the rocks. The Romans, however, knew it under the name Mons Jovis (\\"Mount Jupiter\\"), and erected an altar to Iuppiter Optimus Maximus on the highest mountain, of which some traces remain. During the imperial age, the Romans opened some quarries to extract granite, perhaps used in the construction of villas on the islands of Giglio, Elba, and Giannutri. archive.org Around the middle of the fifth century AD, the caves of the island became home to several hermits escaping from the Vandals of Genseric, the most important of whom was St. Mamilian. They christened the island Mons Christi (\\"Mountain of Christ\\"), from which the modern name is derived. At the beginning of the seventh century, Pope Gregory the Great submitted them to the monastic rule of the Benedictines. In this period, the Monastery of St. Mamilian was founded; as a result of donations to the Church, its wealth became legendary, and a chapel was built in the St. Mamiliano Cave where the saint had lived in the fifth century. In 1216, the monks joined the order of the Camaldolese. Thanks to the donations of several noble families, the monastery became powerful and rich, and this gave rise to the legend of treasure hidden on the island. The island was once a possession of the Republic of Pisa, but was later acquired by the Principality of Piombino. In 1553, Ottoman pirate Dragut, heading for Elba, stormed the monastery, enslaved the monks, and decreed its end. After that, the island was uninhabited. In the second half of the sixteenth century, together with most of the Tuscan Archipelago, it became part of the Stato dei Presidi, a client Spanish state. The island was annexed to the French Empire under Napoleon; after his fall, it became the possession of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The first attempts to colonise Monte Cristo, at the time owned by Charles Cambiagi, were made in 1840 by two German hermits, Augustin Eulhardt and Joseph Keim, who eventually abandoned the attempt. In 1843, other people arrived with the intention of cultivating the island: young Tyrolean Adolph Franz Obermüller, and after a few months, Frenchman Charles Legrand and his girlfriend. Also during 1843, there were other attempts of colonisation by French agriculturalist George Guiboud, which ended with yet another failure. In 1846, some Genoese made a similar effort, while in 1849 Frenchman Jacques Abrial was able to farm the island for three years. In 1852, a rich Englishman named George Watson-Taylor bought Montecristo and transformed Cala Maestra into a garden, planting eucalyptus and many exotic plants, among them the Asiatic Ailanthus altissima, an invasive species which now infests the island. The few modern buildings of Montecristo, such as the Royal Villa, date from this period. The island was then purchased by the Italian government on 3 June 1869 for the sum of £100,000. Montecristo had previously been plundered in 1860 by Italian exiles living in London, who had come to Italy to join up with the Camicie rosse, but were shipwrecked on the island. Faced with the huge sum of money claimed by the owner to repair the damage, the government thought it better to buy the island, which was still uninhabited. Ruins of the Monastery of San Mamiliano After other attempts at colonisation in 1878, the Italian government founded a penal colony there, a branch of that in Pianosa. In 1889, Montecristo was given to Marquess Carlo Ginori, who restored the Villa and transformed the island into a hunting ground. In 1896, Montecristo was the honeymoon destination of Victor Emmanuel III of Savoy (at that time crown prince) and Elena of Montenegro, and after 1899 it became a royal hunting ground for Victor Emmanuel's exclusive use. During the Second World War the island, important because of its position between Italy and occupied Corsica, was garrisoned by the Italian army. In the late 1940s, the Italian Navy Intelligence agency temporarily took over the island for use as a training base for covert agents. Among Italian officers assigned as instructors were Count Marco deCarrobio and Luigi Ferri. The would-be agents belonged to a right wing Albanian expatriate organization known as the Bloku Kombetar Independent led by activist Alush Leshanaku, according to Shyqri Bicaku, an Elbasan native, who underwent training; Bicaku was also taught to use a field radio and became so proficient he was hired on to instruct secret agents from Romania to use the radio for their October, 1951 covert parachute drop into Romania's mountains; the Romanians were captured, tried and executed. Montecristo was used as a Navy training base only from September to November 1948, when the trainees were transferred to Italy's west coast. Four of the trained agents were parachuted into Albania in February, 1949, but soon quit their mission and escaped to Greece due to a failed field radio. After several episodes of vandalism and speculation attempts, the nature reserve was established in 1971. In December 2011 it was reported that black rats, present on the island at least since Roman times, have greatly increased in numbers and pose a serious threat to the birds of Montecristo. Due to the inaccessibility of the terrain, the island was bombed from the air with poison pellets, as had recently been attempted on Giannutri and Sardinia, despite concerns raised by environmental groups that indigenous species of wildlife and the surrounding waters might also be adversely affected.. The Ailanthus trees were also to be eradicated. Geography and climate Montecristo is located in the Tyrrhenian Sea east of Corsica, south of Elba, west of the island of Giglio and the Monte Argentario peninsula, southeast of the island of Pianosa and east of the Scoglio d'Africa rock, also known as Formica di Montecristo. The island, formed by the heaving of a submarine pluton, has a slightly elliptical shape, and is wholly mountainous, with several rock ledges rising steeply from the sea. It consists almost entirely of granodiorite with large crystals of orthoclase. The mountain chain that crosses the island has three main peaks: Monte della Fortezza (645 m), Cima del Colle Fondo (621 m) and Cima dei Lecci (563 m). Montecristo's only natural harbour is Cala Maestra, on the northwest side. The island has plentiful water resources. The island of Montecristo, like all the islands of the archipelago, has a mild climate, with a constant sea breeze, much sunshine, and very little rainfall (average annual values much lower than ); the climate is characterised by mild and moderately rainy winters and summers that are hot and dry, but sometimes very muggy. Wildlife Montecristo's goat (Capra hircus) The conditions that restricted the establishment of human settlements on Montecristo have favoured the preservation of its flora and fauna. Animals and plants once found throughout the Mediterranean still live on the island. Of particular interest are the giant heather formations covering the valley floors and several thousand-year-old oaks that manage to survive at the highest altitudes. Also interesting are the Montecristo viper (Vipera aspis hugyi, a subspecies also present in southern Italy, and today considered introduced by humans) and Discoglossus sardus, an amphibian found only in a couple of islands in Tuscany and Sardinia. An endemic subspecies of lizard, Podarcis muralis calabresiae, thrives on the island. Montecristo is also a resting place for thousands of migratory birds and is home to large colonies of seabirds (particularly relevant the yelkouan shearwater, critically endangered on the island). The island also hosts the only Italian population of wild goats. The sea environment is quite rich: there are seagrass meadows, sea anemones, sea fans, corals and moonfishes. Until the 1970s the Mediterranean monk seal was also to be found, a critically endangered species that has become extremely rare in Italian waters. Endemic species include the plant Limonium Montis-christi, the invertebrate Oxychilus oglasicola (snail of Monte Cristo), also present on the islet of Scola, near Pianosa, and the reptile Podarcis muralis calabresiae. =Island of Montecristo nature reserve= Nowadays the island has only two permanent human inhabitants, both nature reserve keepers. In addition, agents of the State Forestry Corps from Follonica live there in alternating shifts of two weeks at a time. archive.org The state nature reserve Isola di Monte Cristo is a biogenetic reserve of 1,039 hectares established in 1971 by ministerial decree to protect the unique nature of the island. Today it belongs to the Tuscan Archipelago National Park. It was also awarded the European Diploma of Protected Areas in 1988, and recognized as a site of pan- European interest. The beach of Cala Maestra Visitors face a number of restrictions. It is not possible to stay overnight, and swimming, and surfing are prohibited within 1 kilometer of the coast. It is possible to cruise within three miles () of the coast, but fishing is not allowed. Access by sea is possible only at Cala Maestra (where the seabed is sandy) and with an approach course perpendicular to the coast; it is possible to dock at the pier or tie up against a buoy, but dropping anchor is not allowed; there is also a small heliport for emergencies. To visit the island, one must apply for access at the Forestry Corps in Follonica. Visitors with basic authorization must stay at Cala Maestra, and can visit only the Royal Villa, the botanical garden, and the museum. The waiting list for access is long, since the limit for visitors has been set at only 1,000 per year. The average waiting time for approval to visit is three years, and priority is given to scientific expeditions, associations, and schools. Tours take place only on three existing trails, all of which are very challenging.

Biography Born in Alexandria into a poor family, Maximus was the son of Christian parents, who had suffered on account of their religion; but whether from Pagan or Arian violence is not clear. Maximus united the faith of an orthodox believer with the garb and deportment of a Cynic philosopher. He was initially held in great respect by the leading theologians of the orthodox party. Athanasius, in a letter written about 371,Athanasius, Epist. ad Maxim. Philosoph. Opp. vol. i. pays him several compliments on a work written in defence of the orthodox faith. In 374, during the reign of the emperor Valens, in the persecution carried on by Lucius, Arian patriarch of Alexandria, Maximus was flogged, and banished to the Oasis, on account of his zeal for orthodoxy and the aid he offered to those who suffered in the same cause.Gregory of Nazianzus, Orat. xxv. c. 13, 14 He obtained his release in about four years, probably on the death of Valens; and sometime after his release he presented to the emperor Gratian at Milan, his work, Περὶ τῆς πίστεως, De Fide, written against the Arians. He wrote also against other heretics, but whether in the same work or in another is not clear; and disputed against the pagans. Apparently on his return from Milan he visited Constantinople, where Gregory of Nazianzus had just been appointed to the patriarchate (379). Gregory received him with the highest honour; and delivered a panegyrical oration (Oration 25), in the man's own presence in full church, before the celebration of the Eucharist. He received him at his table, and treated him with the greatest confidence and regard. He was, however, grievously disappointed in him. Whether the events which followed were the results solely of the ambition of Maximus, or whether Maximus was himself the tool of others, is not clear. Taking advantage of the sickness of Gregory, and supported by some Egyptian ecclesiastics, sent by Peter II, Patriarch of Alexandria, under whose directions they professed to act, Maximus was ordained, during the night, Patriarch of Constantinople, in the place of Gregory, whose election had not been perfectly canonical. The conspirators chose a night in when Gregory was confined by illness, burst into the cathedral, and commenced the consecration. They had set Maximus on the archiepiscopal throne and had just begun shearing away his long curls when the day dawned. The news quickly spread and everybody rushed to the church. The magistrates appeared with their officers; Maximus and his consecrators were driven from the cathedral, and in the tenement of a flute-player the tonsure was completed. This audacious proceeding excited the greatest indignation among the people, with whom Gregory was popular. Maximus withdrew to Thessalonica to lay his cause before the emperor Theodosius I. He met with a cold reception from the emperor, who committed the matter to Ascholius, the much respected bishop of Thessalonica, charging him to refer it to Pope Damasus I. Two letters from Damasus asked for special care that a Catholic bishop maybe ordained. cites Migne, Patrologia Latina xiii. pp. 366-369; Epp. 5, 5, 6. Maximus returned to Alexandria, and demanded that Peter should assist him in re-establishing himself at Constantinople. Peter appealed to the prefect, by whom Maximus was driven out of Egypt.Gregory of Nazianzus, Carmen de Vita sua, vss. 750-1029. As the death of Peter and the accession of Timothy I of Alexandria are dated to February 14, 380, these events must have occurred in 379. The resignation of Gregory, who was succeeded in the patriarchate of Constantinople by Nectarius, did not benefit Maximus. When the First Council of Constantinople met in 381, Maximus's claim to the see of Constantinople was unanimously rejected, the last of its original four canons decreeing \\"that he neither was nor is a bishop, nor are they who have been ordained by him in any rank of the clergy\\". cites Philippe Labbe, Concilia, ii. 947, 954, 959. Maximus appealed from the Eastern to the Western church. In the autumn of 381 a synod held either at Aquileia or at Milan under Ambrose's presidency considered Maximus's claims. Having only his own representations to guide them, and there being no question that Gregory's translation was uncanonical, while the election of Nectarius was open to grave censure as that of an unbaptized layman, Maximus also exhibiting letters from Peter the late venerable patriarch, to confirm his asserted communion with the church of Alexandria, the Italian bishops pronounced in favour of Maximus and refused to recognize either Gregory or Nectarius. A letter of Ambrose and his brother- prelates to Theodosius cites Ep. xiii. c. i. § 3. remonstrates against the acts of Nectarius as no rightful bishop, since the chair of Constantinople belonged to Maximus, whose restoration they demanded, as well as that a general council of Easterns and Westerns, to settle the disputed episcopate and that of Antioch, should be held at Rome. In 382 a provincial synod held at Rome, having received more accurate information, finally rejected Maximus's claims. cites Hefele, Hist. of Councils, i. pp. 359, 378, 381, Eng. trans. The invectives of Gregory of Nazianzus against Maximus cites Gregory of Nazianzus, Carmina, sc. De Vita sua, l. c.; In Invidos, vs. 16, etc.; In Maximum were written after their struggle for the patriarchate, and contrast starkly with the praises of his twenty-fifth Oration. The work of Maximus, De Fide, which is well spoken of by Jerome, is lost. References ;Attribution * * Venerable cites the following sources: **Greg. Naz.

He achieved lasting fame as the captain of during Charles Darwin's famous voyage, FitzRoy's second expedition to Tierra del Fuego and the Southern Cone. FitzRoy was a pioneering meteorologist who made accurate daily weather predictions, which he called by a new name of his own invention: \\"forecasts\\". In 1854 he established what would later be called the Met Office, and created systems to get weather information to sailors and fishermen for their safety. He was an able surveyor and hydrographer. As Governor of New Zealand, serving from 1843 to 1845, he tried to protect the Māori from illegal land sales claimed by British settlers. Early life and career Robert FitzRoy was born at Ampton Hall, Ampton, Suffolk, England, into the upper echelons of the British aristocracy and a tradition of public service. Through his father, General Lord Charles FitzRoy, Robert was a fourth great-grandson of Charles II of England; his paternal grandfather was Augustus Henry FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton. His mother, Lady Frances Stewart, was the daughter of the first Marquess of Londonderry and the half-sister of Viscount Castlereagh, who became Foreign Secretary. From the age of four, Robert FitzRoy lived with his family at Wakefield Lodge, their Palladian mansion in Northamptonshire. Robert's half- brother Sir Charles FitzRoy later served as Governor of New South Wales, Governor of Prince Edward Island and Governor of Antigua. In February 1818 at the age of 12, FitzRoy entered the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, and in the following year he entered the Royal Navy. At the age of 14, he embarked as a voluntary student aboard the frigate , which sailed to South America in the middle of 1820, and returned in January 1822. He was promoted to midshipman while on the vessel. FitzRoy served on as a midshipman. He completed his course with distinction and was promoted lieutenant on 7 September 1824, having passed the examination with 'full numbers' (100%), the first to achieve this result. After serving on , in 1828 he was appointed flag lieutenant to Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Waller Otway, commander-in-chief of the South American station, aboard . At that time Beagle, under Captain Pringle Stokes, was carrying out a hydrographic survey of Tierra del Fuego, under the overall command of Captain Phillip Parker King in HMS Adventure. Pringle Stokes became severely depressed and fatally shot himself. Under Lieutenant Skyring, the ship sailed to Rio de Janeiro, where Otway appointed FitzRoy as (temporary) captain of the Beagle on 15 December 1828. By the ship's return to England on 14 October 1830, FitzRoy had established his reputation as a surveyor and commander. During the survey, some of his men were camping onshore when a group of Fuegian natives made off with their boat. His ship gave chase and, after a scuffle, the culprits' families were brought on board as hostages. Eventually FitzRoy held two boys, a girl and two men (one man escaped.) As it was not possible to put them ashore conveniently, he decided to \\"civilise the savages\\", teaching them \\"English ... the plainer truths of Christianity ... and the use of common tools\\" before returning them as missionaries. The sailors gave them names: the girl was called Fuegia Basket (so named because the replacement for the stolen boat was an improvised coracle that resembled a basket), the boy Jemmy Button (FitzRoy purchased him with buttons), and the man he named York Minster (after the large rock near which he was captured). The second boy was called Boat Memory. FitzRoy brought the four back with the ship to England. Boat Memory died following a smallpox vaccination. The others were cared for and taught by the trainee missionary Richard Matthews; they were considered civilised enough to be presented at Court to King William IV and Queen Adelaide in the summer of 1831. HMS Beagles second voyage In early May 1831 FitzRoy stood as Tory candidate for Ipswich in the General Election, but was defeated. His hopes of obtaining a new posting and organising a missionary project to Tierra del Fuego appeared to be failing. He was arranging for the charter of a ship at his own expense to return the Fuegians with Matthews when his friend Francis Beaufort, Hydrographer to the British Admiralty, and his \\"kind uncle\\", the Duke of Grafton, interceded on his behalf at the Admiralty. On 25 June 1831 FitzRoy was re-appointed commander of the Beagle. He spared no expense in fitting out the ship. He was conscious of the stressful loneliness of command. He knew of the suicides both of Captain Stokes and of his uncle Viscount Castlereagh, who had cut his own throat in 1822 while in government office. FitzRoy talked to Beaufort in August 1831, asking him to find a suitable gentleman companion for the voyage. Such a companion should share his scientific tastes, make good use of the expedition's opportunities for researching natural history, dine with him as an equal, and provide a semblance of normal human friendship. While those Beaufort first approached (including Professor J. S. Henslow of the University of Cambridge) turned the opportunity down, FitzRoy eventually approved Charles Darwin for the position. Before they left England, FitzRoy gave Darwin a copy of the first volume of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, a book the captain had read that explained terrestrial features as the outcome of a gradual process taking place over extremely long periods. FitzRoy took a request from Lyell to record observations on geological features, such as erratic boulders.Introduction by Janet Browne and Michael Neve to – FitzRoy and Darwin got on well together, but there were inevitable strains during the five-year survey voyage. The captain had a violent temper, his outbursts had gained him the nickname \\"Hot Coffee\\", which resulted in quarrels sometimes \\"bordering on insanity\\", as Darwin later recalled. On a memorable occasion in March 1832 at Bahia, Brazil, Darwin was horrified at tales of the treatment of slaves. FitzRoy, while not endorsing brutality, recounted how an estancia owner once asked his slaves if they wished to be free and was told they did not. Darwin asked FitzRoy if he thought slaves could answer such a question honestly when it was posed by their master, at which the captain lost his temper and, before storming out, told Darwin that if he doubted his word they could no longer live together; effectively he banished Darwin from his table. Before nightfall FitzRoy's temper cooled and he sent an apology, with the request that Darwin \\"continue to live with him.\\" They avoided the subject of slavery from that time on. None of their quarrels were over religious or doctrinal issues; such disagreements came after the voyage. At the island of \\"Buttons Land\\" in Tierra del Fuego they set up a mission post, but when they returned nine days later, the possessions had been looted. Matthews gave up, rejoining the ship. He left the three \\"westernised\\" Fuegians to continue the missionary work. While in the Falkland Islands, FitzRoy bought a schooner out of his own funds to assist with the surveying tasks he had been asked to complete. He had it refitted and renamed Adventure, hoping that the cost would be reimbursed by the Admiralty. They returned to the mission post but found only Jemmy Button. He had returned to native ways and refused the offer to go with them back to England. At Valparaiso in 1834, while Darwin was away from the ship exploring the Andes, the Admiralty reprimanded FitzRoy for buying the Adventure. He took the criticism badly, selling the schooner and announcing they would go back to recheck his survey, then resigning his command with doubts about his sanity. The ship's officers persuaded him to withdraw his resignation and continue as planned once Darwin returned to the ship. FitzRoy continued his voyage, sailing on to the Galapagos, Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. He detoured to Bahia in Brazil on the return voyage so that he could carry out an additional check, to ensure the accuracy of his longitude measurements before returning to England. Return from the voyage Soon after the Beagle's return on 2 October 1836, FitzRoy married Mary Henrietta O'Brien, a young woman to whom he had long been engaged. Darwin was amazed, as not once during the entire five years of the trip had FitzRoy spoken about being engaged. FitzRoy was awarded a gold medal by the Royal Geographical Society in 1837. Extracts from his diary read to the society on 8 May 1837 included the observation: :Is it not extraordinary, that sea-worn, rolled, shingle-stones, and alluvial accumulations, compose the greater portion of these plains? How vast, and of what immense duration, must have been the actions of these waters which smoothed the shingle-stones now buried in the deserts of Patagonia!\\" FitzRoy wrote his account of the voyage, including editing the notes of the previous captain of the Beagle. It was published in May 1839 as the Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of H.M.S. Adventure and Beagle, in four volumes, including Darwin's Journal and Remarks, 1832–1836 as the third volume. FitzRoy's account includes a section of Remarks with reference to the Deluge in which he admits that, having read works \\"by geologists who contradict, by implication, if not in plain terms, the authenticity of the Scriptures\\" and \\"while led away by sceptical ideas,\\" he had remarked to a friend that the vast plain of sedimentary material they were crossing \\"could never have been effected by a forty days' flood.\\" He wrote that in his \\"turn of mind and ignorance of scripture,\\" he was willing to disbelieve the Biblical account. Concerned that such ideas might \\"reach the eyes of young sailors,\\" he explains in detail his renewed commitment to a literal reading of the Bible, with arguments that rock layers high in the mountains containing sea shells are proof of Noah's Flood and that the six days of creation could not have extended over aeons because the grass, herbs and trees would have died out during the long nights. R.D. Keynes, in his introduction to the 2001 edition of Darwin's diary, suggests that FitzRoy had undergone a religious conversion. He was dissociating himself from the new ideas of Charles Lyell, which he had accepted during the voyage, and from Darwin's account which embraced these ideas. Under the influence of his very religious wife, he asserted a new commitment to the doctrine of the established Church of England. In 1841 FitzRoy was elected the Tory Member of Parliament for Durham. He was appointed Acting Conservator of the River Mersey in 1842. Governor of New Zealand The first Governor of New Zealand, Captain William Hobson, R.N., died in late 1842. The Church Missionary Society, which had a strong New Zealand presence, suggested FitzRoy as his successor and he was appointed by the government. He took up his new task in December 1843. On the journey to New Zealand, he met William John Warburton Hamilton and made him his private secretary. His instructions were to maintain order and protect the Māori, while satisfying the land hunger of the settlers pouring into the country. He was given very few military resources. Government revenue, mainly from customs duties, was woefully inadequate for his responsibilities. One of his first tasks was to enquire into the circumstances surrounding the Wairau Affray, in which there had been violent conflict between settlers and the Maori. He found the actions of the colonists to have been illegal and declined to take any action against Te Rauparaha. He did not have the troops to meet him on anything like equal terms. But the New Zealand Company and the settlers felt betrayed and angry. He appointed a Government Superintendent for the area, to establish a ruling presence. Fitzroy also insisted that the New Zealand Company pay the Māori a realistic price for the land they claimed to have purchased. These moves made him very unpopular. Land sales were a continuing vexatious issue. The settlers were eager to buy land and some Māori were willing to sell, but under the provisions of the Treaty of Waitangi, land sales required the Government as an intermediary, and were thus extremely slow. FitzRoy changed the rules to allow settlers to purchase Māori land directly, subject to a duty of ten shillings per acre. But land sales proved slower than expected. To meet the financial shortfall, FitzRoy raised the customs duties, then replaced them with property and income taxes. All these expedients failed. Before long the Colony was faced with bankruptcy, and FitzRoy was forced to begin issuing promissory notes, paper money without backing. Meanwhile, the Māori in the far North, around the Bay of Islands, who had been the first to sign the Treaty of Waitangi, were feeling increasingly sidelined and resentful of the changes that had taken place in New Zealand. To signal their resentment, Hone Heke cut down the flagpole at Kororareka. Rather than address the problems, FitzRoy had the flagpole re-erected. Hone Heke cut it down again, four times altogether; by the fourth occasion the First New Zealand War, sometimes called the Flagstaff War or the Northern War, was well under way. FitzRoy quickly realized that he did not have the resources to bring about a quick end to the war. Meanwhile, the spokesmen for the New Zealand Company were active back in the United Kingdom, lobbying against FitzRoy's Governorship, which they presented to the House of Commons in a very poor light. As a result, he was shortly afterwards recalled and replaced by George Grey, then Governor of South Australia. Grey was given the backing and financial support that FitzRoy had needed but was denied. Later life and impact on meteorology FitzRoy circa 1855 FitzRoy returned to Britain in September 1848 and was made superintendent of the Royal Naval Dockyards at Woolwich. In March 1849 he was given his final sea command, the screw frigate . In 1850, FitzRoy retired from active service, partly due to ill health. The following year, in 1851, he was elected to the Royal Society with the support of 13 fellows, including Charles Darwin. In 1854, on the recommendation of the President of the Royal Society, FitzRoy was appointed as chief of a new department to deal with the collection of weather data at sea. His title was Meteorological Statist to the Board of Trade, and he had a staff of three. This was the forerunner of the modern Meteorological Office. He arranged for captains of ships to provide information, with tested instruments being loaned for this purpose, and for computation of the data collected. Fitzroy fisheries barometer No 98, Stromness, Orkney FitzRoy soon began to work on strategies to make weather information more widely available for the safety of shipping and fishermen. He directed the design and distribution of a type of barometer which, on his recommendation, was fixed at every port to be available to crews for consultation before setting out to sea. Stone housings for such barometers are still visible at many fishing harbours. The invention of several different types of barometers was attributed to him. These became popular and continued in production into the 20th century, characteristically engraved with Admiral FitzRoy's special remarks on interpretation, such as: \\"When rising: In winter the rise of the barometer presages frost.\\" A storm in 1859 that caused the loss of the Royal Charter inspired FitzRoy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made in which he coined the term \\"weather forecast\\". Fifteen land stations were established to use the new telegraph to transmit to him daily reports of weather at set times. The first daily weather forecasts were published in The Times in 1861. The 1859 storm resulted in the Crown distributing storm glasses, then known as \\"FitzRoy's storm barometers\\", to many small fishing communities around the British Isles. In 1860, FitzRoy introduced a system of hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected. He ordered fleets to stay in port under these conditions. The Weather Book, which he published in 1863, was far in advance of the scientific opinion of the time. Queen Victoria once sent messengers to FitzRoy's home requesting a weather forecast for a crossing she was about to make to the Isle of Wight. Many fishing fleet owners objected to the posting of gale warnings, which required that fleets not leave the ports. Under this pressure, FitzRoy's system was abandoned for a short time after his death. The fishing fleet owners reckoned without the pressure of the fishermen, for whom FitzRoy had been a hero responsible for saving many lives. The system was eventually reinstated in simplified form in 1874. When The Origin of Species was published FitzRoy was dismayed and apparently felt guilty for his part in the theory's development. He was in Oxford on 30 June 1860 to present a paper on storms and attended the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at which Samuel Wilberforce attacked Darwin's theory. During the debate FitzRoy, seen as \\"a grey haired Roman nosed elderly gentleman\\", stood in the centre of the audience and \\"lifting an immense Bible first with both and afterwards with one hand over his head, solemnly implored the audience to believe God rather than man\\". As he admitted that The Origin of Species had given him \\"acutest pain\\", the crowd shouted him down. FitzRoy debunked Lieutenant Stephen Martin Saxby's lunar weather forecasting method as pseudoscience. Saxby tried to counter FitzRoy's arguments in the second edition of his book Saxby Weather System (1864). =Death and legacy= Robert FitzRoy's grave FitzRoy had been promoted to rear-admiral on the reserved list in 1857 and was advanced to vice-admiral in 1863. In the coming years, internal and external troubles at the Meteorological Office, financial concerns as well as failing health, and his struggle with depression took their toll.Gribbin, John & Mary (2003). FitzRoy. Review. On 30 April 1865, Vice-Admiral FitzRoy died by suicide by cutting his throat with a razor. FitzRoy died having exhausted his entire fortune (£6,000, the equivalent of £400,000 today) on public expenditure. When this came to light, in order to prevent his wife and daughter living in destitution, his friend and colleague Bartholomew Sulivan began an Admiral FitzRoy Testimonial Fund, which succeeded in getting the government to pay back £3,000 of this sum. (Charles Darwin contributed £100). Queen Victoria gave the special favour of allowing his widow and daughter the use of grace and favour apartments at Hampton Court Palace. FitzRoy is buried in the front churchyard of All Saints' Church in Upper Norwood, south London. His memorial was restored by the Meteorological Office in 1981. FitzRoy's publications arising from the expedition were a major reference point for 19th century Chilean explorers of the westen Patagonia. FitzRoy's book Sailing Directions for South America led Chilean Navy hydrographer Francisco Hudson to investigate in the 1850s the possible existence of a sailing route through internal waters from the Chiloé Archipelago to the Straits of Magellan. Enrique Simpson found instead FitzRoy's mapping of little use noting in 1870 that \\"Fitzroy's chart, that is quite exact until that point [Melinka 43° 53' S], is worthless further ahead...\\". Thus, south of Melinka Simpson relied more in the late 18th century sketches of José de Moraleda y Montero.Simpson, E. (1874). Esploraciones hechas por la Corbeta Chacabuco al mando del capitán de fragata don Enrique M. Simpson en los Archipiélagos de Guaitecas, Chonos i Taitao. Santiago. Imprenta Nacional. Simpson's contemporary Francisco Vidal Gormaz was critical of the over-all work of FitzRoy and Darwin stating that they had failed to acknowledge the importance of the Patagonian islands. Personal life Robert FitzRoy was married twice. In 1836 he married Mary Henrietta O'Brien. They had four children: Emily-Unah, Fanny, Katherine and Robert O'Brien. In 1854, after the death of his first wife, he married Maria Isabella Smyth in London. They had one daughter, Laura Elizabeth. Memorials A memorial to FitzRoy is erected atop a metamorphic outcrop beside the Bahia Wulaia dome middens on Isla Navarino, in the Chilean part of Tierra del Fuego archipelago, South America. It was presented in his bicentenary (2005) and commemorates his 23 January 1833 landing on Wulaia Cove. Another memorial, presented also in FitzRoy's bicentenary, commemorates his Cape Horn landing on 19 April 1830. Mount Fitz Roy (Argentina–Chile, at the extreme south of the continent), was named after him by the Argentine scientist and explorer Francisco Moreno. It is high. The aboriginals had not named it, and used the word chaltén (meaning smoking mountain) for this and other peaks. Fitzroy River, in northern Western Australia, was named after him by Lieutenant John Lort Stokes who, at the time, commanded HMS Beagle (previously commanded by FitzRoy). The South American conifer Fitzroya cupressoides is named after him, as well as the Delphinus fitzroyi, a species of dolphin discovered by Darwin during his voyage aboard the Beagle. Fitzroy, Falkland Islands and Port Fitzroy, New Zealand are also named after him. The World War II Captain class frigate was named after him, as was the weather ship Admiral Fitzroy (formerly ). In 2010 New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) named its new IBM supercomputer \\"FitzRoy\\" in honour of him. On 4 February 2002, when the shipping forecast sea area Finisterre was renamed to avoid confusion with the (smaller) French and Spanish forecast area of the same name, the new name chosen by the UK's Meteorological Office was \\"FitzRoy\\", in honour of their founder. FitzRoy has been commemorated by the Fitzroy Building at the University of Plymouth, used by the School of Earth, Ocean and Environmental Science. There is blue plaque on FitzRoy's house at 38 Onslow Square, London. Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy was commemorated on two stamps issued by the Royal Mail for the Falkland Islands and St Helena. Fitzroy Island in Queensland, Australia, is named after FitzRoy, as are the Fitzroy River and subsequently Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia. In fiction The BBC made a BAFTA award-winning television series in 1978 titled The Voyage of Charles Darwin where Captain Robert Fitzroy was played by actor Andrew Burt with Malcolm Stoddard as Darwin with a storyline that followed the historic interaction between Darwin and FitzRoy before and after their time together on HMS Beagle. In 1997, the play FitzRoy by Juliet Aykroyd was first performed at the University of Reading. It has since been performed under the title The Ostrich and the Dolphin – alluding to Darwin's rhea and the dusky dolphin, named Delphinus fitzroyi by Darwin – before being published as Darwin & FitzRoy in October 2013. A novel by Argentinian writer, Sylvia Iparraguirre, entitled Tierra del Fuego, was published in 2000. It retells the story of Fitzroy's experiment with \\"civilizing\\" the Yamaná from the perspective of a fictional narrator, British-Argentinian Jack Guevarra. The novel received the Sor Juana de la Cruz prize and was translated into English by Hardie St. Martin. A novel entitled This Thing of Darkness by Harry Thompson was published in 2005 (it was published in the U.S. in 2006 under the title To the Edge of the World). The novel's plot followed the lives of FitzRoy, Darwin and others connected with the Beagle expeditions, following them between the years of 1828 and 1865. It was a nominee on the long list for the 2005 Man Booker Prize (although Thompson died in November 2005). The novel Darwin's Dreams by Sean Hoade was published in 2008 and republished in a new edition in 2016. The novel begins with the first meeting of Darwin and FitzRoy and ends with Darwin receiving notice of FitzRoy's suicide. The plot is interlaced with fictional \\"dreams\\" that imagine how the world would be if the ideas of evolutionary thinkers over the millennia had been literally true. The dreams also show how Darwin's subconscious dealt with major themes in his life such as the death of his beloved daughter Annie and his lifelong friendship and rivalry with FitzRoy. The play Darwins Kapten was published by Henning Mankell in 2009, and had its world premiere in 2010 at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. It is about Darwin and his journey on the Beagle: many years after the five-year long voyage, Darwin receives a message that his captain on the ship, FitzRoy, has committed suicide. The play portrays the reception of Darwin's discoveries, as well as the consequences of taking a stand against existing ideas in a world that is built on belief in God as the only creator of life.

Origin and mana Tāmati Wāka Nene from the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography was born to chiefly rank in the Ngāpuhi iwi of the Bay of Islands and Hokianga regions of the North Island of New Zealand. His elder brother was Eruera Maihi Patuone. He was related to Hongi Hika and could trace his ancestry by a number of lines back to Rāhiri, the founder of the Ngāpuhi. He rose to be one of the war leaders of the Ngāpuhi taking an active part in the Musket Wars of 1818–1820. He successfully took his warriors on a rampage the whole length of the North Island, killing and plundering as he went until he reached Cook Strait. It is said that he advised Te Rauparaha to acquire muskets to enhance his influence. In 1828 he successfully averted a war between the Māori of the Bay of Islands and the Hokianga. Then his older brother moved south to what is now the Auckland region, Hauraki, and soon after the paramount chief of the area died of wounds received in battle. Wāka Nene now became the highest ranking chief among his own people and one of the three primary chiefs of the area. At baptism, he added \\"Tāmati Wāka\\" (Thomas Walker) to his name. Support for the Treaty of Waitangi Retro Pattern Crown: Tamati Waaka Nene shaking hands with Governor Hobson at Waitangi on 6 February 1840 Early on he had recognised the value of trade with Pākehā and used his position as chief to protect and encourage both the traders and the Methodist missionaries. He was baptised in 1839 taking the name Thomas Walker or Tāmati Wāka. He also worked with the British Resident, James Busby to regularise the relationships between the two races. In 1835 he signed the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand which proclaimed the sovereignty of the United Tribes. At the negotiations leading up to the signing of the Treaty of WaitangiMaori Signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi Ngapuhi chief Te Wharerahi disagreed with his brothers Rewa and Moka Te Kainga-mataa and spoke for peace and the acceptance of the European, and was duly supported by Nene and Patuone. Nene's influence was significant in persuading many of the tribes to sign the Treaty. The next few years saw a considerable loss of revenue and influence for the northern tribes. The capital of the new country was soon moved down to Auckland. Customs duties were also imposed. Then the Government began to manage the land, specifically they temporarily banned any further felling of kauri trees (Agathis australis), after an over-supply of milled kauri occurred in the Australian market. Commitment to Governor FitzRoy On 8 July 1844 the flagstaff on Maiki Hill at the north end of Kororāreka was cut down for the first time, by the Pakaraka chief Te Haratua. Heke had set out to cut down the flagstaff but was persuaded by Archdeacon William Williams not to do so.Carleton, Hugh, (1874) The Life of Henry Williams, Vol. II, pp. 81–82 On 24 August 1844 Governor FitzRoy arrived in the bay from Auckland upon the frigate . Governor FitzRoy summoned the Ngāpuhi chiefs to a conference at the Te Waimate mission at Waimate on 2 September and apparently defused the situation. Tāmati Wāka Nene requested the Governor to remove the troops and redress the grievances in respect of the Customs duties that were put in place in 1841, that Heke and Pōmare II viewed as damaging the maritime trade from which they benefited. Tāmati Wāka Nene and the other Ngāpuhi chiefs undertook to keep Heke in check and to protect the Europeans in Bay of Islands. Hone Heke did not attend but sent a conciliatory letter and offered to replace the flagstaff. On 10 January 1845 the flagstaff was cut down a second time, this time by Heke. He again cut down the flagstaff on 19 January. When Hone Heke cut down the flag pole for the fourth time on 11 March 1845 and attacked Kororāreka, Nene was offended, feeling that his mana had been trampled on. Nene was already at war with Heke when the British troops began to arrive on the scene. Fighting between the warriors of Heke and Nene between Okaihau and Te Ahuahu After the Battle of Kororāreka, Hone Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti and their warriors travelled inland to Lake Omapere near to Kaikohe some , or two days travel, from the Bay of Islands. Nene built a pā close to Lake Omapere. Heke's pā named Puketutu, was away, while it is sometimes named as \\"Te Mawhe\\" however the hill of that name is some distance to the north-east. In April 1845, during the time that the colonial forces were gathering in the Bay of Islands, the warriors of Heke and Nene fought many skirmishes on the small hill named Taumata-Karamu that was between the two pās and on open country between Okaihau and Te Ahuahu. Heke's force numbered about three hundred men; Kawiti joined Heke towards the end of April with another hundred and fifty warriors. Opposing Heke and Kawiti were about four hundred warriors that supported Tāmati Wāka Nene including his brother Eruera Maihi Patuone and the chiefs, Makoare Te Taonui and his brother Aperahama Taonui, Mohi Tawhai, Arama Karaka Pi and Nōpera Panakareao. F. E. Maning,NZ Herald (13 November 1863) Jacky Marmon and John Webster, of Opononi, Hokianga were three Pākehā Māori (a European turned native) who volunteered to fight with Nene and fought alongside the warriors from Hokianga. Webster used a rifle (a novel weapon at that time) and had made two hundred cartridges. The colonial forces under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Hulme, arrived at Heke's Pā at Puketutu on 7 May 1845. Lieutenant Colonel Hulme and his second in command Major Cyprian Bridge made an inspection of Heke's Pā and found it to be quite formidable. Lacking any better plan they decided on a frontal assault the following day. The attack was a failure and the forces retreated to the Bay of Islands. Lieutenant Colonel Hulme returned to Auckland and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Despard, a soldier who did very little to inspire any confidence in Wāka Nene. Nene's defeat of Heke on 12 June 1845 at Pukenui After the successful defence of Puketutu Pā on the shores of Lake Omapere, Hone Heke returned to his pā at Te Ahuahu. Te Ahuahu was a short distance from both Heke's Pā at Puketutu and the site of the later Battle of Ohaeawai. Some days later he went on to Kaikohe to gather food supplies. During his absence one of Tāmati Wāka Nene's allies, the Hokianga chief, Makoare Te Taonui (the father of Aperahama Taonui), attacked and captured Te Ahuahu. This was a tremendous blow to Heke's mana or prestige, obviously it had to be recaptured as soon as possible. The ensuing battle was a traditional formal Māori conflict, taking place in the open with the preliminary challenges and responses. By Māori standards, the battle was considerably large. Heke mustered somewhere between 400 and 500 warriors while Tāmati Wāka Nene had about 300 men. Hone Heke lost at least 30 warriors. Hugh Carleton (1874) provides a brief description of the battle: Rev. Richard Davis also recorded that a Wāka Nene remained in control of Heke's pā. Heke was severely wounded and did not rejoin the conflict until some months later, at the closing phase of the Battle of Ruapekapeka. In a letter to Lieutenant Colonel Despard the battle was described by Wāka Nene as a \\"most complete victory over Heke\\". Battle of Ohaeawai Russell (Māori-language side) Tāmati Wāka Nene and his warriors supported troops led by Lieutenant Colonel Despard in an attack on Pene Taui's Pā at Ohaeawai. Kawiti and Pene Taui had strengthened the defences of the pā. Nene and Despard, fought side by side, as allies although Despard had an almost complete incomprehension about Nene's experience in attacking fortified pās. At Ohaeawai Nene offered to make a feint attack on the rear of the pā, to divert attention from the soldiers' assault, but this suggestion, like all others offered by Nene, met with a refusal. Nene described the British commander, Lieutenant Colonel Despard, as 'a very stupid man'. Despard on the other hand said \\"if I want help from savages I will ask for it\\". History tends to support Nene's opinion as he had achieved a decisive win against Hone Heke on 12 June 1845, with no help from the British. At the Battle of Ohaeawai after two days of bombardment without effecting a breach, Despard ordered a frontal assault. He was, with difficulty, persuaded to postpone this pending the arrival of a 32-pound naval gun which came the next day, 1 July. However an unexpected sortie from the pā resulted in the temporary occupation of the knoll on which Tāmati Wāka Nene had his camp and the capture of Nene's colours – the Union Jack. The Union Jack was carried into the pā. There it was hoisted, upside down, and at half- mast high, below the Māori flag, which was a Kākahu (Māori cloak). This insulting display of the Union Jack was the cause of the disaster which ensued. Infuriated by the insult to the Union Jack Colonel Despard ordered an assault upon the pā the same day. The attack was directed to the section of the pā where the angle of the palisade allowed a double flank from which the defenders of the pā could fire at the attackers; the attack was a reckless endeavour. The British persisted in their attempts to storm the unbreached palisades and five to seven minutes later 33 were dead and 66 injured, approximately one-third of the soldiers and Royal Marines. Battle of Ruapekapeka A memorial for Tāmati Wāka Nene, in front of Christ Church, Russell (English-language side) Tāmati Wāka Nene and his warriors supported troops led by Lieutenant Colonel Despard in an attack on the pā at Ruapekapeka. Kawiti's tactics was to attempt to repeat the success of the Battle of Ohaeawai and draw the colonial forces into an attack on heavily fortified pā. The colonial forces started a cannon bombardment of Ruapekapeka Pā on 27 December 1845. The siege continued for some two weeks with enough patrols and probes from the pā to keep everyone alert. Then, early in the morning of Sunday, 11 January 1846,Tāmati Wāka Nene's men discovered that the pā appeared to have been abandoned; although Te Ruki Kawiti and a few of his warriors remained behind, and appeared to have been caught unaware by the British assault. The assaulting force drove Kawiti and his warriors out of the pā. Fighting took place behind the pā and most casualties occurred in this phase of the battle. After the Battle of Ruapekapeka, Heke and Kawiti were ready for peace. It was Wāka Nene they approached to act as the intermediary to negotiate with Governor Grey. Nene insisted that no action should be taken against Heke and Kawiti for leading the war. Mana of Wāka Nene after the Northern War The Government lost a great deal of mana and influence in the North as a result of the war, much of which flowed to Tāmati Wāka Nene. He and Heke were recognised as the two most influential men in the North. He was given a pension of one hundred pounds a year and had a cottage built for him in Kororareka (Russell). He continued to advise and assist the Government on matters such as the release of Pomare II in 1846 and Te Rauparaha in 1848. When George Grey was knighted he chose Nene as one of his esquires. Then when he returned for his second term of governorship in 1860 he brought Nene a silver cup from Queen Victoria. Nene accompanied Grey to Taranaki to negotiate a truce with Wiremu Tamihana (the King maker) to end the First Taranaki War in 1861. En route to New Plymouth the ship struck a huge storm but survived which was taken as a favourable omen.  Death  Nene's memorial gravestone in Christ Church, Russell Tāmati Wāka Nene died on 4 August 1871, and is buried in Russell. The Governor at the time, Sir George Bowen, said that Nene did more than any other Māori to promote colonisation and to establish the Queen's authority.

The maximum of is about . If the integrands of and were defined using instead of , then the image would be scaled vertically and horizontally (see below). The Fresnel integrals S(x) and C(x) are two transcendental functions named after Augustin-Jean Fresnel that are used in optics and are closely related to the error function (erf). They arise in the description of near-field Fresnel diffraction phenomena and are defined through the following integral representations: : S(x) = \\\\int_0^x \\\\sin(t^2)\\\\,dt, \\\\quad C(x) = \\\\int_0^x \\\\cos(t^2)\\\\,dt. The simultaneous parametric plot of S(x) and C(x) is the Euler spiral (also known as the Cornu spiral or clothoid). Recently, they have been used in the design of highways and other engineering projects..  Definition  250pxthumb Fresnel integrals with arguments t2/2 instead of t2 converge to 0.5. The Fresnel integrals admit the following power series expansions that converge for all x: : \\\\begin{align} S(x) & =\\\\int_0^x \\\\sin(t^2)\\\\,dt=\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infin}(-1)^n\\\\frac{x^{4n+3}}{(2n+1)!(4n+3)}. \\\\\\\\\\\\ C(x) & =\\\\int_0^x \\\\cos(t^2)\\\\,dt=\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infin}(-1)^n\\\\frac{x^{4n+1}}{(2n)!(4n+1)}. \\\\end{align} Some widely used tables. use \\\\pi t^2 / 2 instead of t^2 for the argument of the integrals defining S(x) and C(x). This changes their limits at infinity from \\\\textstyle (1/2) \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi/2} to 1/2 and the arc length for the first spiral turn from (2\\\\pi) to 2 (at t=2). These alternative functions are usually known as normalized Fresnel integrals.  Euler spiral  250pxthumb Euler spiral (x,y) = (C(t), S(t)). The spiral converges to the centre of the holes in the image as t tends to positive or negative infinity. The Euler spiral, also known as Cornu spiral or clothoid, is the curve generated by a parametric plot of S(t) against C(t). The Cornu spiral was created by Marie Alfred Cornu as a nomogram for diffraction computations in science and engineering. From the definitions of Fresnel integrals, the infinitesimals dx and dy are thus: :\\\\begin{align} dx &= C'(t)\\\\,dt = \\\\cos(t^2)\\\\,dt, \\\\\\\\\\\\ dy &= S'(t)\\\\,dt = \\\\sin(t^2)\\\\,dt. \\\\end{align} Thus the length of the spiral measured from the origin can be expressed as : L = \\\\int_0^{t_0} \\\\sqrt {dx^2 + dy^2} = \\\\int_0^{t_0} dt = t_0. That is, the parameter t is the curve length measured from the origin (0,0), and the Euler spiral has infinite length. The vector (\\\\cos(t^2), \\\\sin(t^2)) also expresses the unit tangent vector along the spiral, giving \\\\theta = t^2. Since t is the curve length, the curvature \\\\kappa can be expressed as : \\\\kappa = \\\\frac{1}{R} = \\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{dt} = 2t. Thus the rate of change of curvature with respect to the curve length is : \\\\frac{d\\\\kappa}{dt} = \\\\frac {d^2\\\\theta}{dt^2} = 2. An Euler spiral has the property that its curvature at any point is proportional to the distance along the spiral, measured from the origin. This property makes it useful as a transition curve in highway and railway engineering: If a vehicle follows the spiral at unit speed, the parameter t in the above derivatives also represents the time. Consequently, a vehicle following the spiral at constant speed will have a constant rate of angular acceleration. Sections from Euler spirals are commonly incorporated into the shape of roller-coaster loops to make what are known as clothoid loops.  Properties  * C(x) and S(x) are odd functions of x. * Asymptotics of the Fresnel integrals as x \\\\to \\\\infty are given by the formulas: :: \\\\begin{align} S(x) & =\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{sign}{(x)}}{2} - \\\\left[1+O(x^{-4}) \\\\right] \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\cos{(x^{2})}}{x \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi}} + \\\\frac{\\\\sin{(x^2)}}{ x^3 \\\\sqrt{8 \\\\pi}} \\\\right) \\\\right), \\\\\\\\\\\\ C(x) & =\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{sign}{(x)}}{2} + \\\\left[1+O(x^{-4}) \\\\right] \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\sin{(x^2)}}{x \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi}} - \\\\frac{\\\\cos{(x^{2})}}{ x^3 \\\\sqrt{8 \\\\pi}} \\\\right) \\\\right). \\\\end{align} Complex Fresnel integral S(z) * Using the power series expansions above, the Fresnel integrals can be extended to the domain of complex numbers, where they become analytic functions of a complex variable. * C(z) and S(z) are entire functions of the complex variable z. * The Fresnel integrals can be expressed using the error function as follows:functions.wolfram.com, Fresnel integral S: Representations through equivalent functions and Fresnel integral C: Representations through equivalent functions.

The limits of these functions as x goes to infinity are known: ::\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\cos t^2\\\\,dt = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\sin t^2 \\\\, dt = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}{4} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{8}} \\\\approx 0.6267. The sector contour used to calculate the limits of the Fresnel integrals The limits of and as the argument x tends to infinity can be found by using several methods. One of themAnother method based on parametric integration is described for example in . uses a contour integral of the function :e^{-t^2} around the boundary of the sector-shaped region in the complex plane formed by the positive -axis, the bisector of the first quadrant with , and a circular arc of radius centered at the origin. As goes to infinity, the integral along the circular arc \\\\gamma_2 tends to \\\\left\\\\int_{\\\\gamma_2}e^{-t^2}dt\\\\right \\\\leq \\\\int_{\\\\gamma_2}e^{-t^2}dt = R\\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/4}e^{-R^2\\\\cos2t}dt \\\\leq R\\\\int_0^{\\\\pi/4}e^{-R^2(1-\\\\frac{4}{\\\\pi}t)}dt = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4R}\\\\left(1-e^{-R^2}\\\\right), where polar coordinates z=Re^{it} were used and Jordan's inequality was utilised for the second inequality. The integral along the real axis \\\\gamma_1 tends to the half Gaussian integral :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-t^2} \\\\, dt = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}}{2}. Note too that because the integrand is an entire function on the complex plane, its integral along the whole contour is zero. Overall, we must have :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-t^2} \\\\, dt = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma_3} e^{-t^2} \\\\, dt, where \\\\gamma_3 denotes the bisector of the first quadrant, as in the diagram. To evaluate the right hand side, parametrize the bisector as :t = re^{\\\\pi i /4} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2}(1 + i)r where r ranges from 0 to +\\\\infty. Note that the square of this expression is just +ir^2. Therefore, substitution gives the right hand side as :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-ir^2}\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2}(1 + i) \\\\, dr. Using Euler's formula to take real and imaginary parts of e^{-ir^2} gives this as : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\int_0^\\\\infty (\\\\cos(r^2) - i\\\\sin(r^2))\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2}(1 + i) \\\\, dr \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\left[\\\\cos(r^2) + \\\\sin(r^2) + i \\\\left(\\\\cos(r^2) - \\\\sin(r^2)\\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\, dr = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}}{2} + 0i, \\\\end{align} where we have written 0i to emphasize that the original Gaussian integral's value is completely real with zero imaginary part. Letting I_C = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\cos(r^2) \\\\, dr, I_S = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\sin(r^2) \\\\, dr and then equating real and imaginary parts produces the following system of two equations in the two unknowns I_C, I_S: : \\\\begin{align} I_C + I_S & = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_C - I_S & = 0. \\\\end{align} Solving this for I_C and I_S gives the desired result.

Born in Montgomery, Alabama, she was noted for her beauty and high spirits, and was dubbed by her husband as \\"the first American flapper\\". She and her husband, F. Scott Fitzgerald, became emblems of the Jazz Age, for which they are still celebrated. The immediate success of Scott's first novel This Side of Paradise (1920) brought them into contact with high society, but their marriage was plagued by wild drinking, infidelity and bitter recriminations. Ernest Hemingway, whom Zelda disliked, blamed her for Scott's declining literary output, though her extensive diaries provided much material for his fiction. After being diagnosed with schizophrenia, she was increasingly confined to specialist clinics, and the couple were living apart when Scott died suddenly in 1940. Zelda died seven years later in a fire at the hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, in which she was a patient. A 1970 biography by Nancy Milford was on the short list of contenders for the Pulitzer Prize. In 1992, Zelda was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame.  Early life and family background  Zelda Sayre at 19, in dance costume Born in Montgomery, Alabama, Zelda Sayre was the youngest of six children. Her mother, Minerva Buckner \\"Minnie\\" Machen (November 23, 1860 – January 13, 1958), named her after characters in two little-known stories: Jane Howard's \\"Zelda: A Tale of the Massachusetts Colony\\" (1866) and Robert Edward Francillon's \\"Zelda's Fortune\\" (1874). A spoiled child, Zelda was doted upon by her mother, but her father, Anthony Dickinson Sayre (1858–1931)Anthony Dickinson Sayre (April 29, 1858 – November 17, 1931), —a justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama and one of Alabama's leading jurists—was a strict and remote man. The family was descended from early settlers of Long Island, who had moved to Alabama before the Civil War. By the time of Zelda's birth, the Sayres were a prominent Southern family. Her great-uncle, John Tyler Morgan, served six terms in the United States Senate; her paternal grandfather edited a newspaper in Montgomery; and her maternal grandfather was Willis Benson Machen, who served a partial term as a U.S. senator from Kentucky. Her siblings were Anthony Dickinson Sayre, Jr. (1894–1933), Marjorie Sayre (Mrs. Minor Williamson Brinson) (1886–1960), Rosalind Sayre (Mrs. Newman Smith) (1889–1979), Clothilde Sayre (Mrs. John Palmer) (1891–1986), and Lenora Sayre (1897-1899), who died of diphtheria at age two. As a child, Zelda Sayre was extremely active. She danced, took ballet lessons and enjoyed the outdoors. In 1914, Sayre began attending Sidney Lanier High School. She was bright, but uninterested in her lessons. Her work in ballet continued into high school, where she had an active social life. She drank, smoked and spent much of her time with boys, and she remained a leader in the local youth social scene. A newspaper article about one of her dance performances quoted her as saying that she cared only about \\"boys and swimming.\\" She developed an appetite for attention, actively seeking to flout convention—whether by dancing or by wearing a tight, flesh-colored bathing suit to fuel rumors that she swam nude. Her father's reputation was something of a safety net, preventing her social ruin, but Southern women of the time were expected to be delicate, docile and accommodating. Consequently, Sayre's antics were shocking to many of those around her, and she became—along with her childhood friend and future Hollywood starlet Tallulah Bankhead—a mainstay of Montgomery gossip. Her ethos was encapsulated beneath her high-school graduation photo:  F. Scott Fitzgerald  Shadowland magazine Zelda first met the future novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald in July 1918, when he had volunteered for the army, and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, outside Montgomery. Scott began to call her daily, and came into Montgomery on his free days. He talked of his plans to be famous, and sent her a chapter of a book he was writing. He was so taken with Zelda that he redrafted the character of Rosalind Connage in This Side of Paradise to resemble her. He wrote, \\"all criticism of Rosalind ends in her beauty,\\" and told Zelda that \\"the heroine does resemble you in more ways than four.\\" Zelda was more than a mere muse, however—after she showed Scott her personal diary, he used verbatim excerpts from it in his novel. At the conclusion of This Side of Paradise, the soliloquy of the protagonist Amory Blaine in the cemetery, for example, is taken directly from her journal. Gloria Patch, in The Beautiful and Damned, is also known to be a permutation of the \\"subjects of statement\\" that appear in Zelda's letters. F. Scott Fitzgerald was known to appreciate and take from Zelda's letters, even at one point plagiarising her diary while he was writing This Side of Paradise. In 1918, Scott showed her diary to his friend Peevie Parrot who then shared it with George Jean Nathan. There was allegedly discussion between the men of publishing it under the name of \\"The Diary of a Popular Girl\\". Zelda's letters stand out for their \\"spontaneous turn of phrase and lyrical style\\" and tendency to use dashes, visually similar to the poems by Emily Dickinson, and experimental grammar. According to Nancy Milford, Scott and Zelda's first encounter was at a country club dance in Montgomery, which Scott fictionalised in his novel The Great Gatsby, when he describes Jay Gatsby's first encounter with Daisy Buchanan, although he transposed the location in the novel to a train station. Scott was not the only man courting Zelda, and the competition only drove Scott to want her more. In the ledger that he meticulously maintained throughout his life, Scott noted in 1918, on September 7, that he had fallen in love. Ultimately, she would do the same. Her biographer Nancy Milford wrote, \\"Scott had appealed to something in Zelda which no one before him had perceived: a romantic sense of self-importance which was kindred to his own.\\" Their courtship was briefly interrupted in October when he was summoned north. He expected to be sent to France, but was instead assigned to Camp Mills, Long Island. While he was there, the Armistice with Germany was signed. He then returned to the base near Montgomery, and by December they were inseparable. Scott would later describe their behavior as \\"sexual recklessness.\\"; On February 14, 1919, he was discharged from the military and went north to establish himself in New York City. They wrote frequently, and by March 1920, Scott had sent Zelda his mother's ring, and the two had become engaged. Many of Zelda's friends and members of her family were wary of the relationship, as they did not approve of Scott's excessive drinking, and Zelda's Episcopalian family did not like the fact that he was a Catholic.  Marriage  By September, Scott had completed his first novel, This Side of Paradise, and the manuscript was quickly accepted for publication. When he heard the novel had been accepted, Scott wrote to his editor Maxwell Perkins, urging an accelerated release: \\"I have so many things dependent on its success—including of course a girl.\\" In November, he returned to Montgomery, triumphant with the news of his novel. Zelda agreed to marry him once the book was published; he, in turn, promised to bring her to New York with \\"all the iridescence of the beginning of the world.\\" This Side of Paradise was published on March 26, Zelda arrived in New York on March 30, and on April 3, 1920, before a small wedding party in St. Patrick's Cathedral, they married.; ; According to Canterbery and Birch (and Fitzgerald himself), this first novel was Fitzgerald's \\"ace in the hole\\", a poker term. Scott saw the novel's publication as the way to Zelda's heart. Scott and Zelda quickly became celebrities of New York, as much for their wild behavior as for the success of This Side of Paradise. They were ordered to leave both the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for their drunkenness. Zelda once jumped into the fountain at Union Square. When Dorothy Parker first met them, Zelda and Scott were sitting atop a taxi. Parker said, \\"They did both look as though they had just stepped out of the sun; their youth was striking. Everyone wanted to meet him.\\" Their social life was fueled with alcohol. Publicly, this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties, but privately it increasingly led to bitter fights. To their delight, in the pages of the New York newspapers Zelda and Scott had become icons of youth and success—enfants terribles of the Jazz Age.; ; ; Bryer, Jackson R. \\"A Brief Biography.\\" In On Valentine's Day in 1921, while Scott was working to finish his second novel, The Beautiful and Damned, Zelda discovered she was pregnant. They decided to go to Scott's home in St. Paul, Minnesota to have the baby.; Bryer in On October 26, 1921, she gave birth to Frances \\"Scottie\\" Fitzgerald. As she emerged from the anesthesia, Scott recorded Zelda saying, \\"Oh, God, goofo I'm drunk. Mark Twain. Isn't she smart—she has the hiccups. I hope it's beautiful and a fool—a beautiful little fool.\\" Many of her words found their way into Scott's novels: in The Great Gatsby, the character Daisy Buchanan expresses a similar hope for her daughter.; Zelda in 1922 Zelda never became particularly domestic, nor showed any interest in housekeeping. By 1922, the Fitzgeralds had employed a nurse for their daughter, a couple to clean their house, and a laundress. When Harper & Brothers asked her to contribute to Favorite Recipes of Famous Women she wrote, \\"See if there is any bacon, and if there is, ask the cook which pan to fry it in. Then ask if there are any eggs, and if so try and persuade the cook to poach two of them. It is better not to attempt toast, as it burns very easily. Also, in the case of bacon, do not turn the fire too high, or you will have to get out of the house for a week. Serve preferably on china plates, though gold or wood will do if handy.\\"Lanahan, Dorothy. \\"Introduction.\\" In In early 1922, Zelda again became pregnant. Although some writers have said that Scott's diaries include an entry referring to \\"Zelda and her abortionist\\", there is, in fact, no such entry. Zelda's thoughts on the second pregnancy are unknown, but in the first draft of The Beautiful and Damned, the novel Scott was completing, he wrote a scene in which the main female character Gloria believes she is pregnant and Anthony suggests she \\"talk to some woman and find out what's best to be done. Most of them fix it some way.\\" Anthony's suggestion was removed from the final version, a change which shifted focus from the abortion choice to Gloria's concern that a baby would ruin her figure.; As The Beautiful and Damned neared publication, Burton Rascoe, the freshly appointed literary editor of the New York Tribune, approached Zelda for an opportunity to entice readers with a cheeky review of Scott's latest work. In her review, she made joking reference to the use of her diaries in Scott's work, but the lifted material became a genuine source of resentment: > To begin with, every one must buy this book for the following aesthetic > reasons: First, because I know where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress > for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and, also, if enough people > buy it where there is a platinum ring with a complete circlet, and, also, if > loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the > one he has done well enough for the last three years ... It seems to me that > on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which > mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of > letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In > fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to > believe that plagiarism begins at home.Lanahan. In The piece led to Zelda receiving offers from other magazines. In June 1922, a piece by Zelda Fitzgerald, \\"Eulogy on the Flapper,\\" was published in Metropolitan Magazine. Though ostensibly a piece about the decline of the flapper lifestyle, Zelda's biographer Nancy Milford wrote that the essay was \\"a defense of her own code of existence.\\" Zelda described the flapper: > The Flapper awoke from her lethargy of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, put on > her choicest pair of earrings and a great deal of audacity and rouge and > went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a > one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure ... she was conscious > that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do. Mothers > disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and > most of all to heart. Zelda continued writing, selling several short stories and articles. She helped Scott write the play The Vegetable, but when it flopped the Fitzgeralds found themselves in debt. Scott wrote short stories furiously to pay the bills, but became burned out and depressed. In April 1924, they left for Paris.  Expatriation  After arriving in Paris, they soon relocated to Antibes on the French Riviera. While Scott was absorbed writing The Great Gatsby, Zelda became infatuated with a dashing young French pilot, Edouard S. Jozan. She spent afternoons swimming at the beach and evenings dancing at the casinos with Jozan. After six weeks, Zelda asked for a divorce. Scott at first demanded to confront Jozan, but instead dealt with Zelda's demand by locking her in their house, until she abandoned her request for divorce. Jozan did not know she'd asked for a divorce. He left the Riviera later that year, and the Fitzgeralds never saw him again. Later in life he told Zelda's biographer Milford that any infidelity was imaginary: \\"They both had a need of drama, they made it up and perhaps they were the victims of their own unsettled and a little unhealthy imagination.\\" In Fitzgerald's, \\"A Life in Letters,\\" Fitzgerald referred to the Jozan affair in his August letter to Ludlow Fowler. He writes of lost illusions in The Great Gatsby as his lost certainty in Zelda's fidelity. The book reflected the dramatized pivotal aspects of his and Zelda's love, of courtship, break, restoration with financial success, and the Jozan betrayal: \\"I feel old too, this summer ... the whole burden of this novel—the loss of those illusions that give such color to the world that you don't care whether things are true or false as long as they partake of the magical glory.\\" The Great Gatsby was in draft form during the July 1924 Jozan crisis; the typescript was sent to Scribners at the end of October. Fitzgerald wrote in his notebooks, \\"That September 1924, I knew something had happened that could never be repaired.\\" After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up appearances with their friends, seeming happy. In September, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills. The couple never spoke of the incident, and refused to discuss whether it was a suicide attempt. Scott returned to writing, finishing The Great Gatsby in October. They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby.; It was also on this trip, while ill with colitis, that Zelda began painting. In April 1925, back in Paris, Scott met Ernest Hemingway, whose career he did much to promote. Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald became firm friends, but Zelda and Hemingway disliked each other from their first meeting, and she openly described him as \\"bogus,\\" \\"that fairy with hair on his chest\\" and \\"phoney as a rubber check.\\" She considered Hemingway's domineering macho persona to be merely a posture; Hemingway in turn, told Scott that Zelda was crazy. Her dislike was probably not helped by Scott's repeated insistence that she recount the story of her affair with Jozan to Hemingway and his wife, Hadley. In an embellishment, the Fitzgeralds told the Hemingways that the affair ended when Jozan committed suicide. It was through Hemingway, however, that the Fitzgeralds were introduced to much of the Lost Generation expatriate community: Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, Robert McAlmon, and others. One of the most serious rifts occurred when Zelda told Scott that their sex life had declined because he was \\"a fairy\\" and was likely having a homosexual affair with Hemingway. There is no evidence that either was homosexual, but Scott nonetheless decided to have sex with a prostitute to prove his heterosexuality. Zelda found condoms that he had purchased before any encounter occurred, and a bitter fight ensued, resulting in lingering jealousy. She later threw herself down a flight of marble stairs at a party because Scott, engrossed in talking to Isadora Duncan, was ignoring her. Literary critic Edmund Wilson, recalling a party at the Fitzgerald home in Edgemoor, Delaware, in February 1928, described Zelda as follows:  Obsession and illness  Though Scott drew heavily upon his wife's intense personality in his writings, much of the conflict between them stemmed from the boredom and isolation Zelda experienced when Scott was writing. She would often interrupt him when he was working, and the two grew increasingly miserable throughout the 1920s. Scott had become severely alcoholic, Zelda's behavior became increasingly erratic, and neither made any progress on their creative endeavors. Zelda had a deep desire to develop a talent that was entirely her own. At age 27, she became obsessed with ballet, which she had studied as a girl. She had been praised for her dancing skills as a child, and although the opinions of their friends vary as to her skill, it appears that she did have a fair degree of talent. But Scott was totally dismissive of his wife's desire to become a professional dancer, considering it a waste of time. She rekindled her studies too late in life to become a truly exceptional dancer, but she insisted on grueling daily practice (up to eight hours a day) that contributed to her subsequent physical and mental exhaustion. In September 1929, she was invited to join the ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples, but, as close as this was to the success she desired, she declined the invitation. While the public still believed the Fitzgeralds to live a life of glamor, friends noted that the couple's partying had somewhere gone from fashionable to self-destructive—both had become unpleasant company. In April 1930, Zelda was admitted to a sanatorium in France where, after months of observation and treatment and a consultation with one of Europe's leading psychiatrists, Doctor Eugen Bleuler, she was diagnosed as a schizophrenic. Initially admitted to a hospital outside Paris, she was later moved to a clinic in Montreux, Switzerland. The clinic primarily treated gastrointestinal ailments, and because of her profound psychological problems she was moved to a psychiatric facility in Prangins on the shores of Lake Geneva. She was released in September 1931, and the Fitzgeralds returned to Montgomery, Alabama, where her father, Judge Sayre, was dying. Amid her family's bereavement, Scott announced that he was leaving for Hollywood. Zelda's father died while Scott was gone, and her health again deteriorated. By February 1932, she had returned to living in a psychiatric clinic.  Save Me the Waltz  In 1932, while being treated at the Phipps Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Zelda had a burst of creativity. Over the course of her first six weeks at the clinic, she wrote an entire novel and sent it to Scott's publisher, Maxwell Perkins. When Scott finally read Zelda's book, a week after she'd sent it to Perkins, he was furious. The book was a semi-autobiographical account of the Fitzgeralds' marriage. In letters, Scott berated her and fumed that the novel had drawn upon the autobiographical material that he planned to use in Tender Is the Night, which he'd been working on for years, and which would finally see publication in 1934.; Bryer in . Scott forced Zelda to revise the novel, removing the parts that drew on shared material he wished to use. Though the Great Depression had struck America, Scribner agreed to publish her book, and a printing of 3,010 copies was released on October 7, 1932. The parallels to the Fitzgeralds were obvious. The protagonist of the novel is Alabama Beggs (like Zelda, the daughter of a Southern judge), who marries David Knight, an aspiring painter who abruptly becomes famous for his work. They live the fast life in Connecticut before departing to live in France. Dissatisfied with her marriage, Alabama throws herself into ballet. Though told she has no chance, she perseveres and after three years becomes the lead dancer in an opera company. Alabama becomes ill from exhaustion, however, and the novel ends when they return to her family in the South, as her father is dying. Thematically, the novel portrays Alabama's struggle (and hence Zelda's as well) to rise above being \\"a back-seat driver about life\\" and to earn respect for her own accomplishments—to establish herself independently of her husband. Zelda's writing style was quite different from Scott's. The language used in Save Me the Waltz is filled with verbal flourishes and complex metaphors. The novel is also deeply sensual; as literary scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin wrote in 1979, \\"The sensuality arises from Alabama's awareness of the life surge within her, the consciousness of the body, the natural imagery through which not only emotions but simple facts are expressed, the overwhelming presence of the senses, in particular touch and smell, in every description.\\" In its time, the book was not well received by critics. To Zelda's dismay, it sold only 1,392 copies, for which she earned $120.73. The failure of Save Me the Waltz, and Scott's scathing criticism of her for having written it—he called her \\"plagiaristic\\" and a \\"third-rate writer\\"—crushed her spirits. It was the only novel she ever saw published.  Remaining years, fire, and death  Self- portrait, watercolor, probably painted in the early 1940s From the mid-1930s, Zelda spent the rest of her life in various stages of mental distress. Some of the paintings that she had created over the previous years, in and out of sanatoriums, were exhibited in 1934. As with the tepid reception of her book, Zelda was disappointed by the response to her art. The New Yorker described them merely as \\"Paintings by the almost mythical Zelda Fitzgerald; with whatever emotional overtones or associations may remain from the so-called Jazz Age.\\" No actual description of the paintings was provided in the review. She became violent and reclusive—in 1936 Scott placed her in the Highland Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, writing ruefully to friends: > Zelda now claims to be in direct contact with Christ, William the Conqueror, > Mary Stuart, Apollo and all the stock paraphernalia of insane-asylum jokes > ... For what she has really suffered, there is never a sober night that I do > not pay a stark tribute of an hour to in the darkness. In an odd way, > perhaps incredible to you, she was always my child (it was not reciprocal as > it often is in marriages) ... I was her great reality, often the only > liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her. Zelda remained in the hospital while Scott returned to Hollywood for a $1,000-a-week job with MGM in June 1937. Without Zelda's knowledge, he began a serious affair with the movie columnist Sheilah Graham. Despite the excitement of the affair, Scott was bitter and burned out. When their daughter Scottie was thrown out of her boarding school in 1938, he blamed Zelda. Though Scottie was subsequently accepted by Vassar College, his resentment of Zelda was stronger than ever before. Of Scott's mindset, Milford wrote, \\"The vehemence of his rancor toward Zelda was clear. It was she who had ruined him; she who had made him exhaust his talents ... He had been cheated of his dream by Zelda.\\" After a drunken and violent fight with Graham in 1938, Scott returned to Asheville. A group from Zelda's hospital had planned to go to Cuba, but Zelda had missed the trip. The Fitzgeralds decided to go on their own. The trip was a disaster even by their standards: Scott was beaten up when he tried to stop a cockfight and returned to the United States so intoxicated and exhausted that he was hospitalized. The Fitzgeralds never saw each other again.; Bryer in . Scott returned to Hollywood and Graham; Zelda returned to the hospital. She nonetheless made progress in Asheville, and in March 1940, four years after admittance, she was released. She was nearing forty now, her friends were long gone, and the Fitzgeralds no longer had much money. Scott was increasingly embittered by his own failures and his old friend Hemingway's continued success. They wrote each other frequently until Scott's death in December 1940. Zelda was unable to attend his funeral in Rockville, Maryland. Zelda read the unfinished manuscript of the novel Scott was writing upon his death, The Last Tycoon. She wrote to literary critic Edmund Wilson, who had agreed to edit the book, musing on his legacy. Zelda believed, her biographer Milford said, that Scott's work contained \\"an American temperament grounded in belief in oneself and 'will-to-survive' that Scott's contemporaries had relinquished. Scott, she insisted, had not. His work possessed a vitality and stamina because of his indefatigable faith in himself.\\" After reading The Last Tycoon, Zelda began working on a new novel of her own, Caesar's Things. As she had missed Scott's funeral, so she missed Scottie's wedding. By August 1943 she had returned to the Highland Hospital. She worked on her novel while checking in and out of the hospital. She did not get better, nor did she finish the novel. On the night of March 10, 1948, a fire broke out in the hospital kitchen. Zelda was locked into a room, awaiting electroshock therapy. The fire moved through the dumbwaiter shaft, spreading onto every floor. The fire escapes were wooden, and they caught fire as well. Nine women, including Zelda, died. She was identified by her dental records and, according to other reports, one of her slippers. Zelda and Scott's current grave in Rockville, MarylandTheir daughter, Scottie, wrote after their deaths: > I think (short of documentary evidence to the contrary) that if people are > not crazy, they get themselves out of crazy situations, so I have never been > able to buy the notion that it was my father's drinking which led her to the > sanitarium. Nor do I think she led him to the drinking.Lanahan. In Scott and Zelda were buried in Rockville, Maryland—originally in the Rockville Union Cemetery, away from his family plot. Only one photograph of the original gravesite is known to exist. That photo was taken in 1970 by Fitzgerald scholar Richard Anderson and was first published as part of a 2016 essay by fellow-scholar Bryant Mangum, \\"An Affair of Youth: in search of flappers, belles, and the first grave of the Fitzgeralds.\\" In 1975, however, Scottie successfully campaigned for them to be buried with the other Fitzgeralds at Saint Mary's Catholic Cemetery. Inscribed on their tombstone is the final sentence of The Great Gatsby: \\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\\"  Legacy  At the time of his sudden death in 1940, Scott believed himself a failure, and Zelda's death in 1948 was little noted. However, interest in the Fitzgeralds surged in the years following their deaths. In 1950, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who knew the couple from his Hollywood years, wrote The Disenchanted, with characters based recognizably on the Fitzgeralds who end up as forgotten former celebrities, he awash with alcohol and she befuddled by mental illness. It was followed in 1951 by Cornell University professor Arthur Mizener's The Far Side of Paradise, a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald that rekindled interest in the couple among scholars. Mizener's biography was serialized in The Atlantic Monthly, and a story about the book appeared in Life magazine, then one of America's most widely read and discussed periodicals. Scott was viewed as a fascinating failure; Zelda's mental health was largely blamed for his lost potential.Prigozy, Ruth. \\"Introduction: Scott, Zelda, and the culture of Celebrity.\\" In Lance Adell as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Lauren Bloom as Zelda Fitzgerald in The Last Flapper, a dramatization of Zelda's life A play based on The Disenchanted opened on Broadway in 1958. Also that year, Scott's Hollywood mistress Sheilah Graham published a memoir, Beloved Infidel, about his last years. Beloved Infidel became a bestseller and later a film starring Gregory Peck as Scott and Deborah Kerr as Graham. The book and movie painted him in a more sympathetic light than the earlier works. In 1970, however, the history of Scott and Zelda's marriage saw its most profound revision in a book by Nancy Milford, then a graduate student at Columbia University. Zelda: A Biography, the first book-length treatment of Zelda's life, became a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, and figured for weeks on The New York Times best-seller list. The book recast Zelda as an artist in her own right whose talents were belittled by a controlling husband. Thus in the 1970s, Zelda became an icon of the feminist movement—a woman whose unappreciated potential had been suppressed by patriarchal society.Prigozy in When Tennessee Williams dramatized the Fitzgeralds' lives in the 1980s in Clothes for a Summer Hotel, he drew heavily on Milford's account. A caricature of Scott and Zelda emerged: as epitomes of the Jazz Age's glorification of youth, as representatives of the Lost Generation, and as a parable about the pitfalls of too much success. Zelda was the inspiration for \\"Witchy Woman\\", the song of seductive enchantresses written by Don Henley and Bernie Leadon for the Eagles, after Henley read Zelda's biography; of the muse, the partial genius behind her husband F. Scott Fitzgerald, the wild, bewitching, mesmerizing, quintessential \\"flapper\\" of the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties, embodied in The Great Gatsby as the uninhibited and reckless personality of Daisy Buchanan. Zelda's name served as inspiration for Princess Zelda, the eponymous character of The Legend of Zelda series of video games. Series co-creator Shigeru Miyamoto explained, \\"[Fitzgerald] was a famous and beautiful woman from all accounts, and I liked the sound of her name. So I took the liberty of using her name for the very first Zelda title.\\" New York City's borough of Manhattan's Battery Park's resident wild turkey Zelda (d. 2014) was also named after her, because according to legend during one of Fitzgerald's nervous breakdowns, she went missing and was found in Battery Park, apparently having walked several miles downtown. Of Zelda's legacy in popular culture, biographer Cline wrote, \\"Recently myth has likened Zelda to those other twentieth-century icons, Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana. With each she shares a defiance of convention, intense vulnerability, doomed beauty, unceasing struggle for a serious identity, short tragic life and quite impossible nature.\\" In 1989, the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald museum opened in Montgomery, Alabama. The museum is in a house they briefly rented in 1931 and 1932. It is one of the few places where some of Zelda's paintings are kept on display. Painting Zelda Fitzgerald as an artist in her own right, Deborah Pike wrote a biography titled The Subversive Art of Zelda Fitzgerald (2017). Pike notes Zelda's creative output as \\"an important contribution to the history of women's art with new perspectives on women and modernity, plagiarism, creative partnership, and the nature of mental illness,\\" based on literary analysis of Zelda's published and unpublished work as well as her husband's. = Critical reappraisal = After the success of Milford's biography, scholars and critics began to look at Zelda's work in a new light. In a 1968 edition of Save Me the Waltz, F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli wrote, \\"Save Me the Waltz is worth reading partly because anything that illuminates the career of F. Scott Fitzgerald is worth reading—and because it is the only published novel of a brave and talented woman who is remembered for her defeats.\\"Quoted in But as Save Me the Waltz was increasingly read alongside Milford's biography, a new perspective emerged. In 1979, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin wrote rebutting Bruccoli's position: \\"Save Me the Waltz is a moving and fascinating novel which should be read on its own terms equally as much as Tender Is the Night. It needs no other justification than its comparative excellence.\\" Save Me the Waltz became the focus of many literary studies that explored different aspects of her work: how the novel contrasted with Scott's take on the marriage in Tender Is the Night; how the commodity culture that emerged in the 1920s placed stress on modern women; and how these attitudes led to a misrepresentation of \\"mental illness\\" in women. Zelda Fitzgerald's collected writings (including Save Me the Waltz), edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli, were published in 1991. New York Times literary critic Michiko Kakutani wrote, \\"That the novel was written in two months is amazing. That for all its flaws it still manages to charm, amuse and move the reader is even more remarkable. Zelda Fitzgerald succeeded, in this novel, in conveying her own heroic desperation to succeed at something of her own, and she also managed to distinguish herself as a writer with, as Edmund Wilson once said of her husband, a 'gift for turning language into something iridescent and surprising.'\\" Scholars continue to examine and debate the role that Scott and Zelda may have had in stifling each other's creativity.Bryer, Jackson R. \\"The critical reputation of F. Scott Fitzgerald.\\" In . Zelda's biographer Cline wrote that the two camps are \\"as diametrically opposed as the Plath and Hughes literary camps\\"—a reference to the heated controversy about the relationship of husband–wife poets Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath. Zelda's artwork also has been reappraised as interesting in its own right. After spending much of the 1950s and '60s in family attics—Zelda's mother even had much of the art burned because she disliked it—her work has drawn the interest of scholars. Exhibitions of her work have toured the United States and Europe. A review of the exhibition by curator Everl Adair noted the influence of Vincent van Gogh and Georgia O'Keeffe on her paintings and concluded that her surviving corpus of art \\"represents the work of a talented, visionary woman who rose above tremendous odds to create a fascinating body of work—one that inspires us to celebrate the life that might have been.\\" In 1992, Zelda was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame.

It had 1,319 inhabitants in 2010. The town got its name from its location on the island of Marstrand. Despite its small population, for historical reasons Marstrand is often referred to as a city. The town has expanded to the neighbouring island of Koön, which has bridge access to the mainland. History Marstrand has held city privileges since 1200. The most striking feature of Marstrand is the 17th-century fortress Carlsten, named for King Carl X Gustav of Sweden. During the last quarter of the 18th century Marstrand had free port status granted by King Gustav III. Religious liberty established by the same sovereign allowed the first Swedish congregation of Jews to be established there in 1775Pages by the Swedish Tax Authority on historical congregations and Scandinavia's first synagogue to be set up in the fortress in 1780. Administratively Marstrand with immediately surrounding islands was a municipality of its own until the local government reform of 1971 when it was merged into Kungälv Municipality.  Sports  = Sailing = Being an island makes Marstrand popular for sailing and boat races. Marstrand is the host venue for Match Cup Sweden, part of the World Match Racing Tour.

Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald. She was a writer, a journalist (for The Washington Post, The New Yorker, The Northern Virginia Sun, and others), and a prominent member of the Democratic Party. She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1992. Early life Zelda Fitzgerald in 1922 F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1921 Fitzgerald was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Upon her birth, her mother supposedly remarked that she hoped Scottie would be a \\"beautiful little fool,\\" which Daisy Buchanan also says in The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's best known novel. Scottie Fitzgerald spent her childhood moving from place to place with her parents – including time spent living in Paris and Antibes in France, and for five years in a beach house her father rented on the coast of the Chesapeake Bay not far from Baltimore, Maryland. She attended Calvert School and briefly attended the Bryn Mawr School while her mother Zelda received treatment at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. In 1936, Fitzgerald began attending the Ethel Walker School, a boarding school in Connecticut, but was expelled for sneaking away from campus to hitchhike to Yale. She attended Vassar College. Hoping that she would not repeat his academic failures, her father wrote letters to her urging her to take rigorous classes and work hard. She graduated from Vassar in 1942, eighteen months after her father's death. Personal life and career Fitzgerald and her first husband, Samuel Jackson \\"Jack\\" Lanahan, a prominent Washington lawyer, were popular hosts in Washington in the 1950s and 1960s. During this period, she wrote musical comedies about the Washington social scene that were performed annually to benefit the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Washington. Her show Onward and Upward with the Arts was considered for a Broadway run by producer David Merrick. Fitzgerald had four children with her first husband: Thomas Addison Lanahan; Eleanor Anne Lanahan; Samuel Jackson Lanahan, Jr.; and Cecilia Scott Lanahan. Their eldest child, Thomas, known as \\"Tim\\", died by suicide at age 27. Eleanor \\"Bobbie\\" Lanahan, an artist and writer, wrote a biography of her mother, Scottie, The Daughter of ... The Life of Frances Scott Fitzgerald Lanahan Smith (1995). Fitzgerald's second marriage, to Grove Smith, ended in divorce in 1979. Later life and death In 1973, when Scottie Fitzgerald's son Thomas was alive and she was legally separated from husband Grove Smith, she moved from Washington, DC to her mother's home town of Montgomery, Alabama. According to a book authored by her daughter Eleanor after her death, she told her family and many friends that she was moving far away from Washington because she was disgusted by constant news reports of the Watergate scandal. Several months after Scottie Fitzgerald's relocation, she was attending a party in Montgomery when she was informed by a long distance telephone call of her son's suicide. She made polite excuses about leaving the party without giving the other guests any clue as to what had happened. Fitzgerald became active in the state Democratic Party in Alabama and worked with Walter Mondale during his campaign trips to Montgomery over the years. During the 12 years she lived in Montgomery before developing throat cancer, she traveled frequently to visit her three surviving children and grandchildren, none of whom lived near Alabama. Fitzgerald died at her Montgomery home from throat cancer at age 64 in 1986.Orlando Sentinel obituary. Retrieved April 2, 2013.

Scott Fitzgerald, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, and Thomas Wolfe. Early life and education Perkins was born on September 20, 1884, in New York City, to Elizabeth (Evarts) Perkins, a daughter of William M. Evarts, and Edward Clifford Perkins, a lawyer.1900 United States Federal Census He grew up in Plainfield, New Jersey, attended St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire and then graduated from Harvard College in 1907. Although an economics major in college, Perkins also studied under Charles Townsend Copeland, a literature professor who helped prepare Perkins for his career. Career After working as a reporter for The New York Times, Perkins joined the publishing house of Charles Scribner's Sons in 1910. At that time, Scribner's was known for publishing older authors such as John Galsworthy, Henry James, and Edith Wharton. However, Perkins wished to publish younger writers. Unlike most editors, he actively sought out promising new artists; he made his first big find in 1919 when he signed F. Scott Fitzgerald. Initially, no one at Scribner's except Perkins had liked The Romantic Egotist, the working title of Fitzgerald's first novel, and it was rejected. Even so, Perkins worked with Fitzgerald to revise the manuscript until it was accepted by the publishing house. Its publication as This Side of Paradise (1920) marked the arrival of a new literary generation that would always be associated with Perkins. Fitzgerald's profligacy and alcoholism strained his relationship with Perkins. Nonetheless, Perkins remained Fitzgerald's friend to the end of Fitzgerald's short life, in addition to his editorial relationship with the author, particularly evidenced in The Great Gatsby (1925), which benefited substantially from Perkins' criticism. It was through Fitzgerald that Perkins met Ernest Hemingway, publishing his first major novel, The Sun Also Rises, in 1926. Perkins fought for it over objections to Hemingway's profanity raised by traditionalists in the firm. The commercial success of Hemingway's next novel, A Farewell to Arms (1929), which topped the best-seller list, silenced colleagues' questions about Perkins' editorial judgment. The greatest professional challenge Perkins faced was posed by Thomas Wolfe's lack of artistic self-discipline. Wolfe wrote voluminously and was greatly attached to each sentence he wrote. After a tremendous struggle, Perkins induced Wolfe to cut 90,000 words from his first novel, Look Homeward, Angel (1929). His next, Of Time and the River (1935), was the result of a two- year battle during which Wolfe kept writing more and more pages in the face of an ultimately victorious effort by Perkins to hold the line on size. At first grateful to Perkins for discovering and mentoring him, Wolfe later came to resent the popular perception that he owed his success to his editor. Wolfe left Scribner's after numerous fights with Perkins. Despite this, Perkins served as Wolfe's literary executor after his early death in 1938 and was considered by Wolfe to be his closest friend. Although his reputation as an editor is most closely linked to these three, Perkins worked with many other writers. He was the first to publish J. P. Marquand and Erskine Caldwell. His advice was responsible for the success of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, whose The Yearling (1938) grew out of suggestions made by Perkins. It became a best- seller and won the Pulitzer Prize. Alan Paton's Cry, the Beloved Country (1946) was another Perkins find. His penultimate discovery was James Jones, who approached Perkins in 1945. Perkins persuaded Jones to abandon the autobiographical novel he was working on and launched him on what would become From Here to Eternity (1951). By this time, Perkins' health was failing and he did not live to see its success, nor that of Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea (1952), which was dedicated to his memory.Perkins, Maxwell Evarts; Baughman, Judith, The sons of Maxwell Perkins: letters of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Wolfe, and their editor, University of South Carolina Press, 2004. Cf. p. xxvii Perkins' final discovery was Marguerite Young, who started her mammoth Miss MacIntosh, My Darling in 1947 with his encouragement, signing a contract in 1947 based on her 40-page manuscript. The novel was finally published in 1965. Perkins was noted for his courtesy and thoughtfulness. He also recognized skilled writing wherever he found it and encouraged writers as few editors did. That Ring Lardner has a reputation today, for example, is because Perkins saw him as more than a syndicated humorist. Perkins believed in Lardner more than the writer did, and despite the failure of several earlier collections he coaxed Lardner into letting him assemble another under the title How To Write Short Stories (1924). The book sold well and, thanks to excellent reviews, established Lardner as a literary figure. Apart from his roles as coach, friend, and promoter, Perkins was unusual among editors for the close and detailed attention he gave to books, and for what the novelist Vance Bourjaily, another of his discoveries, called his \\"infallible sense of structure.\\" Although he never pretended to be an artist himself, Perkins could often see where an author ought to go more clearly than the writer did. By combining these different editorial activities into his work, Perkins might be considered to be the first authors' editor. Scholar Matthew Bruccoli described Perkins as the most widely known literary editor of American literature. Personal life In 1910 Perkins married Louise Saunders, also of Plainfield, who bore him five daughters. Perkins died on June 17, 1947 in Stamford, Connecticut from pneumonia. His home in Windsor, Vermont had been purchased from John Skinner in the 1820s for $5,000 by William M. Evarts, and had been passed down to Evarts' daughter and Max's mother, Elizabeth Hoar Evarts Perkins. She left the home to family members, including her son Maxwell. The home stayed in the family until 2005, and has been restored and reopened as the Snapdragon Inn. The inn houses the Maxwell Perkins Library, which displays and collects items related to Maxwell Perkins and his extended family. His house in New Canaan, Connecticut, the Maxwell E. Perkins House, is on the National Register of Historic Places. His granddaughter, Ruth King Porter, is a Vermont writer, and one of his grandsons is the Riptide TV series actor Perry King. In popular culture In the 1983 film Cross Creek, exploring his professional relationship with Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Perkins is portrayed by actor Malcolm McDowell. In the 2016 biographical drama film Genius, based on A. Scott Berg's biography of the man, Max Perkins: Editor of Genius, Perkins is portrayed by British actor Colin Firth.

Scott Fitzgerald. In 1941, it was published posthumously under this title, as prepared by his friend Edmund Wilson, a critic and writer. According to Publishers Weekly, the novel is \\"[g]enerally considered a roman a clef,\\" with its lead character, Monroe Stahr, modeled after film producer Irving Thalberg.http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-521-40231-6 The story follows Stahr's rise to power in Hollywood, and his conflicts with rival Pat Brady, a character based on MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer. It was adapted as a TV play in 1957 and a film in 1976 of the same name, with a screenplay for the motion picture by British dramatist Harold Pinter. Elia Kazan directed the film adaptation; Robert De Niro and Theresa Russell starred. In 1993, a new version of the novel was published under the title The Love of the Last Tycoon, edited by Matthew Bruccoli, a Fitzgerald scholar. This version was adapted for a stage production that premiered in Los Angeles, California in 1998. In 2013, HBO announced plans to produce an adaptation. HBO cancelled the project and gave the rights to Sony Pictures, which produced and released the television series on Amazon Studios in 2016. Publication history The novel was unfinished and in rough form at the time of Fitzgerald's death at age 44. The literary critic and writer Edmund Wilson, a close friend of Fitzgerald, collected the notes for the novel and edited it for publication. The unfinished novel was published in 1941 as The Last Tycoon, by which name it is best known. In 1993, another version of the novel was published under the title The Love of the Last Tycoon, as part of the Cambridge edition of the Works of F. Scott Fitzgerald, edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli, a Fitzgerald scholar. Bruccoli reworked the extant seventeen chapters of the thirty-one planned according to his interpretation of the author's notes. Plot summary Set in the 1930s, The Last Tycoon traces the life of Hollywood studio manager Monroe Stahr, clearly based on Irving Thalberg (head of the film company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer), whom Fitzgerald had encountered several times. The novel begins with young NYC college student Cecelia Brady (first- person narrator), the daughter of influential Hollywood producer Pat Brady, preparing to fly home to Los Angeles. At the airport, she is surprised to meet an old friend of her father, author Wylie White. White is accompanied by a failed producer introduced as Mr. Schwartz. Due to complications during the flight, they make a forced landing in Nashville, Tennessee. The threesome decide on a spontaneous trip to the historic estate of former President Andrew Jackson, but on arrival the attraction is closed. Wylie then proceeds to flirt shamelessly with Cecelia while Mr. Schwartz is fast asleep. When Schwartz awakens, he informs them that he has changed his mind and will not travel to Los Angeles with them. He asks Wylie to deliver a message to a friend, which he gladly accepts. The next day, Wylie and Cecelia learn that Schwartz committed suicide right after they left Nashville. Cecelia realises that the message Schwarz gave to Wylie was in fact for Monroe Stahr, her father's business partner. She has had a crush on Monroe for many years. Cecelia arrives at her father's film studio to pick him up for a birthday party. Due to an unexpected minor earthquake, Cecelia, her father, and his companions all end up in Stahr's office. A water pipe bursts and floods the set. Stahr beholds two women desperately clinging to the head of a statue – finding one of them to be the spitting image of his late wife. The day after, Stahr asks his secretary to identify the girls for him. She presents him with a phone number which he immediately uses to arrange a meeting with one of the girls. Unfortunately, it is not the girl he wished to see; she does not resemble his wife at all. Stahr gives her a ride home, where she insists that he come in and meet her friend (the young Irish-born Kathleen Moore). As soon as Moore opens the front door, Stahr recognises her to be the woman he had seen the other night. Kathleen withstands his advances to her and even refuses to tell him her name. It is only when Stahr happens to meet her again at a party that he can convince her to go out and have a cup of coffee with him. He drives her to the building site of his new house in Santa Monica. Kathleen seems reluctant to be with Stahr, but she still ends up having sex with him. A short time afterwards, Stahr receives a letter in which Kathleen confesses to have been engaged to another man for quite some time. She has now decided to marry him despite having fallen in love with Stahr. Stahr asks Cecelia to arrange for a meeting with a suspected communist who wants to organise a labour union within the film studio. Stahr and Cecelia meet the man over supper where Stahr gets drunk and gets involved in a violent confrontation. Cecelia takes care of him and they grow closer. Cecelia's father, however, becomes more and more unhappy with Stahr as a business partner and has wanted to get rid of him for a long while. He could not approve less of his daughter's fancying him. Brady knows of Stahr's continued affair with the now-married Kathleen and tries to blackmail him into leaving the company. As he fails to achieve his goal via blackmail, he does not even shy away from hiring a professional killer. Stahr survives, and, in retaliation, also appoints a hit man to have Brady killed. Unlike Brady's, Stahr's conscience starts to trouble in. But, just as he contemplates calling the execution off, his plane crashes on its way back to New York City. The contract killer finishes his job unhindered and leaves Cecelia both without a father and without a lover – the two men who meant the world to her.

He studied at Cornell University, where one of his professors was the noted author Vladimir Nabokov, and at Yale University. On campus, he was a founding member of the fledgling Manuscript Society, graduating in 1953. In 1960, he received a PhD in English literature studies from the University of Virginia, where he was supervised by Fredson Bowers. Bruccoli's interest in F.

Career Bruccoli taught at the University of Virginia and the Ohio State University early in his career. He settled at the University of South Carolina, where he earned tenure and taught for four decades. He lived in Columbia, South Carolina, where, according to his New York Times obituary, he \\"cut a dash on campus, instantly recognizable by his vintage red Mercedes convertible, Brooks Brothers suits, Groucho mustache and bristling crew cut that dated to his Yale days. His untamed Bronx accent also set him apart.\\" Over the course of his career, Bruccoli wrote more than 50 critical books on F. Scott Fitzgerald and other literary figures. His 1981 biography of Fitzgerald, Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald, is considered the standard Fitzgerald biography. He has edited many of Fitzgerald's works, from This Side of Paradise to Fitzgerald's unfinished final novel, The Last Tycoon. It had first been published posthumously in 1941. Edited by Bruccoli, it was published in a new version in 1993 as The Love of the Last Tycoon, part of a collection by Cambridge University Press. Bruccoli also edited Zelda Fitzgerald's only novel Save Me the Waltz; she was married to Scott. While studying Fitzgerald, Bruccoli and his wife Arlyn began to collect all manner of Fitzgerald memorabilia. Bruccoli owned the artist's copy of Celestial Eyes, the cover art by Francis Cugat which appeared on the cover of the first edition, and most modern editions, of The Great Gatsby. In 1969, Bruccoli befriended Frances \\"Scottie\\" Fitzgerald, the daughter of the Fitzgeralds. In 1976, Bruccoli and Scottie Fitzgerald Smith published The Romantic Egoists, from the scrapbooks that F. Scott and Zelda had maintained. These had included numerous photographs and book reviews.

Biography =Early life and poetry= He was born in Slobozia, the son of Ştefan Dinescu, a metalworker, and Aurelia (born Badea). Dinescu studied at the Faculty of Journalism of the Ștefan Gheorghiu Academy, and was considered a gifted young poet during his youth, with several poetry volumes published. =Dissidency= In August 1988, Dinescu was invited by the USSR Union of Writers in the Soviet Union and on August 25, he gave an interview to the Romanian section of the Voice of Russia. During the interview, he expressed his support for the Glasnost and Perestroika policies of the Soviet Union. After returning to Bucharest, he invited some friends (including Gabriel Liiceanu, Alexandru Paleologu and Andrei Pleșu) to write a protest against Ceaușescu's policies that were destroying Romanian culture and villages, but they failed to reach a consensus on the text and Dinescu decided to write his own protest.Deletant, p. 280 The members of the group were then visited by the Securitate, which argued that their actions were done under KGB orders as an attack against Romania, not against Ceaușescu. His book, Moartea citeşte ziarul (\\"Death is reading the newspaper\\") was turned down in 1988 by the Communist regime's censorship apparatus, and was then published in Amsterdam. On March 17, 1989, he was fired from România Literară literary magazine,Deletant, p. 279 as a result of an anti-totalitarian interview against President Nicolae Ceauşescu, which Dinescu had granted to the French newspaper Libération in December 1988.Deletant, p. 281 According to him, the reason for dismissal was \\"receiving visits from diplomats and journalists from Socialist and capitalist countries without permission\\". He was expelled from the Romanian Communist Party, held under house arrest, with his house guarded 24/7, all visits banned; he was allowed to go outside just for shopping, but always flanked by two Securitate officers.Deletant, p. 283 Dinescu got support from seven writers (Geo Bogza, Ștefan Augustin Doinaș, Dan Hăulică, Octavian Paler, Andrei Pleșu, Alexandru Paleologu and Mihail Şora), who wrote a letter to Dumitru Radu Popescu, the President of the Writers' Union, asking him \\"to undo an injustice\\". Despite the original authors' secrecy (they didn't publish it abroad), six of them (all, except for Geo Bogza, a veteran socialist) were forbidden to publishing. He got additional support from poet Doina Cornea, literary critics Alexandru Călinescu and Radu Enescu,Deletant, p. 286-8 and, in November 1989, a collective of 18 young academics and writers, who also wrote letters to Popescu.Deletant, p. 289 Despite being isolated, Dinescu noticed that with a handful of exceptions, the writers did not protest against the oppression of the regime. On November 11, he wrote a statement in which he attacked the Romanian intelligentsia for their sycophancy for Ceaușescu, the Romanian Orthodox Church for being \\"trade unionists in religious vestments\\", journalists for being 'apostles of the personality cult\\" and writers for being \\"trusted handmaidens of the party\\".Deletant, p. 289-290 =Revolution= In December 1989 he took a preeminent part in the Romanian Revolution, taking part in the occupation of the National Television building by the people of Bucharest. According to popular rumors, his fellow revolutionary Ion Caramitru, unaware that he was being filmed, said to Dinescu something that was taken to be \\"Mircea, fă-te că lucrezi!\\" (\\"Mircea, pretend you are working!\\"); this was to be proof that the Revolution was a carefully staged front for a coup d'état. According to the investigation of Alex Mihai Stoenescu, Caramitru actually said \\"Mircea, arată că lucrezi\\" (\\"Mircea, show like you're working [on something]\\" – while holding Dinescu's booklet in front of camera), to which Dinescu replied \\"La un apel\\" (\\"[I'm working] on an appeal [to the people]\\") – which was indicative of their ill-preparedness and preoccupation in quickly drafting a single revolutionary proclamation on the spot.Alex Mihai Stoenescu, \\"Decembrie '89 – Revoluţia română, în direct\\" (\\"December '89 – the Romanian revolution, live in front of cameras\\") , in Jurnalul Naţional, December 13, 2005 =Journalist after 1989= After the fall of Communism, he co-founded Academia Caţavencu, the most famous Romanian satirical magazine. He quit the publication in 1998 and went on founding his own publications, Plai cu Boi (loosely translated as \\"Land of the Dumb\\") – a satirical Playboy-style magazine and Aspirina Săracului (The Poor Man's Aspirin – a humorous reference to sexual intercourse) – a weekly satirical magazine. He invested a part of the money he earned from the books published into agriculture, his estate makes the wine sold under the name Vinul Moşierului (\\"Landlord's wine\\") – the name is a tongue-in-cheek reference to an ironic comment President Ion Iliescu had made about Dinescu's social status. Dinescu remains a strong and charismatic voice of the civil society. As member of Consiliul Naţional pentru Studierea Arhivelor Securităţii (National Council for Studying the Archives of the Securitate), he is particularly concerned with exposing the former officers and collaborators of Securitate. He is also a strong critic of Communism and of Romanian leaders that had connections with the Communist regime. Although not politically involved, he openly supported Traian Băsescu's candidature for President of Romania during the 2004 elections. In May 2005, in collaboration with the journalist Cristian Tudor Popescu, he started a new newspaper called Gândul, with an initial circulation of 100,000 copies, but he sold his shares in July 2006. He and Stelian Tănase host a talk show on Realitatea TV (Tănase şi Dinescu). Dinescu was appointed a Commander of the Order of the Star of Romania. In 1991, he became an Honorary Member of the University of Augsburg.

It is a semi-autobiographical account of her life and marriage to F. Scott Fitzgerald.  Background  By the 1930s, Zelda Fitzgerald had already been in and out of psychiatric facilities, and her husband was stalled writing his next work; he had not produced a novel since 1925's The Great Gatsby. After an episode of hysteria, Zelda was admitted to the Phipps Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore on February 12, 1932 for treatment by Dr. Adolf Meyer, an expert on schizophrenia. As part of her recovery routine, she spent at least two hours a day writing. Zelda developed a bond with a young female resident, Dr. Mildred Squires, and toward the end of February she shared an aspect of her novel with Squires, who wrote to Scott that the novel was vivid and had charm. Meanwhile, Scott became worried that Zelda's treatment would consume all his money, so he set aside his novel to work on short stories to fund the treatment. Zelda wrote to Scott from the hospital, \\"I am proud of my novel, but I can hardly restrain myself enough to get it written. You will like it—It is distinctly École Fitzgerald, though more ecstatic than yours—perhaps too much so.\\" Zelda wrote furiously each day; she finished the novel on March 9 and sent the unaltered manuscript to Scott's publisher, their friend Maxwell Perkins at Scribner's. Perkins thought the manuscript was unimpressive, but he agreed to publish the book regardless. Scott was \\"hurt\\" that Zelda had not shown her manuscript to him before sending a copy to Perkins. He also was shocked that Zelda's novel covered the same events which he had been working on for four years in his unfinished novel. (Scott would use much of the same autobiographical material in his 1934 novel Tender Is the Night.) Zelda wrote him, \\"I was also afraid we might have touched the same material.\\" Scott was also angry that she had named her heroine's husband Amory Blaine, the name of the young protagonist of Scott's first novel This Side of Paradise. However, despite his annoyance, \\"the revisions [which] Scott finally demanded were actually relatively few, and that the disagreement was quickly resolved, with Scott recommending the novel to Perkins.\\" Scott wrote to Perkins: \\"Here is Zelda's novel. It is a good novel now, perhaps a very good novel—I am too close to tell. It has the faults and virtues of a first novel. ... It is about something and absolutely new, and should sell.\\" Zelda signed the contract to publish the book on June 14, 1932. It was published on October 7 with a printing of 3,010 copies—not unusually low for a first novel in the middle of the Great Depression—on cheap paper, with a cover of green linen. According to Zelda, the book derived its title from a Victor record catalog, and it suggests the romantic glitter of the life which F. Scott Fitzgerald and herself lived and which Scott's novels have so indelibly written into American literary and cultural history. Divided into four chapters, each of which is further divided into three parts, the novel is a chronological narrative of four periods in the lives of Alabama and David Knight, names that are but thin disguises for their real-life counterparts.  Plot  Alabama Beggs, a girl who \\"wanted her own way about things\\", marries a twenty-two-year-old artist, David Knight. As with Zelda and Scott, Alabama met David when he was an Army officer stationed in her Southern town during World War I. Knight becomes a successful painter, and the family moves to the Riviera where Alabama has a romance with a French aviator. Later David abandons her at a nightmarish dinner party to spend the night with a fashionable dancer. Determined to be successful in her own right, Alabama decides to become a ballerina and devotes herself relentlessly to the cause. She grows further and further apart from her husband and daughter. She is offered an opportunity to dance featured parts with a prestigious company in Naples—and she takes it, and goes to live in the city alone; in life Zelda was offered a similar chance but did not take it. Alabama dances her solo debut in the opera Faust. A blister becomes infected from the glue in the box of her toe shoe, leading to blood poisoning, and Alabama can never dance again. Though outwardly successful, Alabama and David are miserable. At the novel's end they return to the South where Alabama's father is dying. Though she says otherwise, her friends from the South go on about how happy and lucky Alabama is. Alabama searches for meaning in her father's death, but finds none. While cleaning up after their final party before returning to their unhappy lives, Alabama remarks that emptying the ashtrays is \\"very expressive of myself. I just lump everything in a great heap which I have labeled 'the past,' and having thus emptied this deep reservoir that was once myself, I am ready to continue.\\" The last paragraph shows the Knights immobile:  Reception  The reviews by literary critics were mostly negative. The critics deemed the prose overwritten, the characters weak and uninteresting, and scenes which should have been tragedy instead a \\"harlequinade\\". The New York Times wrote: \\"It is not only that her publishers have not seen fit to curb an almost ludicrous lushness of writing but they have not given the book the elementary services of a literate proofreader.\\" Zelda was greatly depressed by the negative reviews, though she acknowledged to Maxwell Perkins that a review from William McFee, writing in The New York Sun, was at least intelligible. McFee wrote: Malcolm Cowley, a friend of the Fitzgeralds, read the book and wrote to Scott, \\"It moves me a lot: she has something there that nobody got into words before.\\" Yet another friend, Ernest Hemingway, believed the work lacked artistic merit and warned editor Maxwell Perkins that if he ever published a novel by any of his wives, \\"I'll bloody well shoot you.\\" Perkins himself was unimpressed by the work. The book sold only 1,392 copies for which she earned $120.73. The failure of Save Me the Waltz crushed Zelda's spirits. She had been working throughout the fall of 1932 on a second novel, based on her experiences in psychiatric treatment. But Scott's reaction was unkind. In a fight before Zelda was readmitted to treatment, Fitzgerald said her novel was \\"plagiaristic, unwise in every way... should not have been written.\\" Zelda asked, \\"Didn't you want me to be a writer?\\" Though Scott once had, he lashed out, \\"No, I do not care whether you were a writer or not, if you were any good... [but] you are a third-rate writer and a third-rate ballet dancer.\\" The psychiatrist agreed with Scott. Zelda was devastated; she never published another novel.

This example calculates the value of T when S = 7.30 and R = 1.17 are substituted into the equation. The isopleth crosses the scale for T at just under 4.65. A nomogram (from Greek νόμος nomos, \\"law\\" and γραμμή grammē, \\"line\\"), also called a nomograph, alignment chart, or abaque, is a graphical calculating device, a two-dimensional diagram designed to allow the approximate graphical computation of a mathematical function. The field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne (1862–1938) and used extensively for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas to a practical precision. Nomograms use a parallel coordinate system invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard Cartesian coordinates. A nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. The result is obtained by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an index line or isopleth. Nomograms flourished in many different contexts for roughly 75 years because they allowed quick and accurate computations before the age of pocket calculators. Results from a nomogram are obtained very quickly and reliably by simply drawing one or more lines. The user does not have to know how to solve algebraic equations, look up data in tables, use a slide rule, or substitute numbers into equations to obtain results. The user does not even need to know the underlying equation the nomogram represents. In addition, nomograms naturally incorporate implicit or explicit domain knowledge into their design. For example, to create larger nomograms for greater accuracy the nomographer usually includes only scale ranges that are reasonable and of interest to the problem. Many nomograms include other useful markings such as reference labels and colored regions. All of these provide useful guideposts to the user. An impedance Smith chart (with no data plotted) Like a slide rule, a nomogram is a graphical analog computation device, and like the slide rule, its accuracy is limited by the precision with which physical markings can be drawn, reproduced, viewed, and aligned. While the slide rule is intended to be a general-purpose device, a nomogram is designed to perform a specific calculation, with tables of values effectively built into the construction of the scales. Nomograms are typically used in applications where the level of accuracy they offer is sufficient and useful. Alternatively, a nomogram can be used to check an answer obtained from another, more exact but possibly error-prone calculation. Other types of graphical calculators such as intercept charts, trilinear diagrams and hexagonal charts are sometimes called nomograms. Other such examples include the Smith chart, a graphical calculator used in electronics and systems analysis, thermodynamic diagrams and tephigrams, used to plot the vertical structure of the atmosphere and perform calculations on its stability and humidity content. These do not meet the strict definition of a nomogram as a graphical calculator whose solution is found by the use of one or more linear isopleths. Description Components of a parallel-scale nomogram A nomogram for a three-variable equation typically has three scales, although there exist nomograms in which two or even all three scales are common. Here two scales represent known values and the third is the scale where the result is read off. The simplest such equation is u1 \\\\+ u2 \\\\+ u3 = 0 for the three variables u1, u2 and u3. An example of this type of nomogram is shown on the right, annotated with terms used to describe the parts of a nomogram. More complicated equations can sometimes be expressed as the sum of functions of the three variables. For example, the nomogram at the top of this article could be constructed as a parallel-scale nomogram because it can be expressed as such a sum after taking logarithms of both sides of the equation. The scale for the unknown variable can lie between the other two scales or outside of them. The known values of the calculation are marked on the scales for those variables, and a line is drawn between these marks. The result is read off the unknown scale at the point where the line intersects that scale. The scales include 'tick marks' to indicate exact number locations, and they may also include labeled reference values. These scales may be linear, logarithmic, or have some more complex relationship. The sample isopleth shown in red on the nomogram at the top of this article calculates the value of T when S = 7.30 and R = 1.17. The isopleth crosses the scale for T at just under 4.65; a larger figure printed in high resolution on paper would yield T = 4.64 to three-digit precision. Note that any variable can be calculated from values of the other two, a feature of nomograms that is particularly useful for equations in which a variable cannot be algebraically isolated from the other variables. Straight scales are useful for relatively simple calculations, but for more complex calculations the use of simple or elaborate curved scales may be required. Nomograms for more than three variables can be constructed by incorporating a grid of scales for two of the variables, or by concatenating individual nomograms of fewer numbers of variables into a compound nomogram. Applications Nomograms have been used in an extensive array of applications. A sample includes * The original application by d'Ocagne, the automation of complicated cut and fill calculations for earth removal during the construction of the French national railway system. This was an important proof of concept, because the calculations are non-trivial and the results translated into significant savings of time, effort, and money. * The design of channels, pipes and wires for regulating the flow of water. * The work of Lawrence Henderson, in which nomograms were used to correlate many different aspects of blood physiology. It was the first major use of nomograms in the United States and also the first medical nomograms anywhere. Nomograms continue to be used extensively in medical fields. * Ballistics calculations prior to fire control systems, where calculating time was critical. * Machine shop calculations, to convert blueprint dimensions and perform calculations based on material dimensions and properties. These nomograms often included markings for standard dimensions and for available manufactured parts. * Statistics, for complicated calculations of properties of distributions and for operations research including the design of acceptance tests for quality control. * Operations Research, to obtain results in a variety of optimization problems. * Chemistry and chemical engineering, to encapsulate both general physical relationships and empirical data for specific compounds. * Aeronautics, in which nomograms were used for decades in the cockpits of aircraft of all descriptions. As a navigation and flight control aid, nomograms were fast, compact and easy-to-use calculators. * Astronomical calculations, as in the post-launch orbital calculations of Sputnik 1 by P.E. Elyasberg.Yu.A.Mozzhorin Memories at the website of Russian state archive for scientific-technical documentation * Engineering work of all kinds: Electrical design of filters and transmission lines, mechanical calculations of stress and loading, optical calculations, and so forth. * Military, where complex calculations need to be made in the field quickly and with reliability not dependent on electrical devices. *Seismology, where nomograms have been developed to estimate earthquake magnitude and to present results of probabilistic seismic hazard analyses Examples =Parallel- resistance/thin-lens= Parallel electrical resistance nomogram The nomogram below performs the computation :\\\\frac{1}{1/A+1/B}=\\\\frac{AB}{A+B} This nomogram is interesting because it performs a useful nonlinear calculation using only straight-line, equally graduated scales. While the diagonal line has a scale \\\\sqrt{2} times larger than the axes scales, the numbers on it exactly match those directly below or to its left, and thus it can be easily created by drawing a straight line diagonally on a sheet of graph paper. A and B are entered on the horizontal and vertical scales, and the result is read from the diagonal scale. Being proportional to the harmonic mean of A and B, this formula has several applications. For example, it is the parallel-resistance formula in electronics, and the thin-lens equation in optics. In the example, the red line demonstrates that parallel resistors of 56 and 42 ohms have a combined resistance of 24 ohms. It also demonstrates that an object at a distance of 56 cm from a lens whose focal length is 24 cm forms a real image at a distance of 42 cm. =Chi-squared test computation= Chi-squared distribution nomogram The nomogram below can be used to perform an approximate computation of some values needed when performing a familiar statistical test, Pearson's chi-squared test. This nomogram demonstrates the use of curved scales with unevenly spaced graduations. The relevant expression is :\\\\frac{(OBS - EXP)^2}{EXP} The scale along the top is shared among five different ranges of observed values: A, B, C, D and E. The observed value is found in one of these ranges, and the tick mark used on that scale is found immediately above it. Then the curved scale used for the expected value is selected based on the range. For example, an observed value of 9 would use the tick mark above the 9 in range A, and curved scale A would be used for the expected value. An observed value of 81 would use the tick mark above 81 in range E, and curved scale E would be used for the expected value. This allows five different nomograms to be incorporated into a single diagram. In this manner, the blue line demonstrates the computation of :(9 − 5)2/ 5 = 3.2 and the red line demonstrates the computation of :(81 − 70)2 / 70 = 1.7 In performing the test, Yates's correction for continuity is often applied, and simply involves subtracting 0.5 from the observed values. A nomogram for performing the test with Yates's correction could be constructed simply by shifting each \\"observed\\" scale half a unit to the left, so that the 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ... graduations are placed where the values 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ... appear on the present chart. =Food risk assessment= Food risk assessment nomogram Although nomograms represent mathematical relationships, not all are mathematically derived. The following one was developed graphically to achieve appropriate end results that could readily be defined by the product of their relationships in subjective units rather than numerically. The use of non- parallel axes enabled the non-linear relationships to be incorporated into the model. The numbers in square boxes denote the axes requiring input after appropriate assessment. The pair of nomograms at the top of the image determine the probability of occurrence and the availability, which are then incorporated into the bottom multistage nomogram. Lines 8 and 10 are ‘tie lines’ or ‘pivot lines’ and are used for the transition between the stages of the compound nomogram. The final pair of parallel logarithmic scales (12) are not nomograms as such, but reading-off scales to translate the risk score (11, remote to extremely high) into a sampling frequency to address safety aspects and other ‘consumer protection’ aspects respectively. This stage requires political ‘buy in’ balancing cost against risk. The example uses a three-year minimum frequency for each, though with the high risk end of the scales different for the two aspects, giving different frequencies for the two, but both subject to an overall minimum sampling of every food for all aspects at least once every three years. This risk assessment nomogram was developed by the UK Public Analyst Service with funding from the UK Food Standards Agency for use as a tool to guide the appropriate frequency of sampling and analysis of food for official food control purposes, intended to be used to assess all potential problems with all foods, although not yet adopted. =Sample size estimation= Nomogram for sample size estimation This nomogram can be used to estimate the sample size requirements for statistical analyses. It uses four parameters: α (fixed), effect size (ρ or δ), statistical power, and number of cases N (two scales for α = .05 (liberal) or .01 (conservative)). The hypothesized effect size in the population can either be expressed as a correlation coefficient (ρ) or a normalized difference in means (δ) for a T-test. The normalized difference is equal to the absolute value of the difference between two population means (μ₁ − μ₂), divided by the pooled standard deviation (s). The statistical power desired is estimated by 1 − β, where β is equal to the probability of making a type II error. A type II error is failing to reject the statistical null hypothesis (i.e., ρ or δ is zero), when in fact the null hypothesis is false in the population and should be rejected. Cohen (1977)Cohen, J. (1977). Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences, 2nd. ed. San Diego, CA: Academic Press recommends using power equal to 0.80 or 80%, for a β = 0.20 . The sample size or number of cases required is reported for two standard levels of statistical significance (α = 0.01 or 0.05). The value of α is the probability of making a type I error. A type I error is rejecting the statistical null hypothesis (i.e., claiming that either ρ or δ is zero), when in fact it is true (the value is zero) in the population and should not be rejected. The most commonly used values of α are 0.05 or 0.01 . To find the sample size requirements for a given statistical analysis, estimate the effect size expected in the population (ρ or δ) on the left hand axis, select the desired level of power on the right hand axis, and draw a line between the two values. Where the line intersects with either the α = 0.05 or α = 0.01 middle axis will indicate the sample size required to achieve statistical significance of α less than 0.05 or 0.01, respectively (for the previously given parameters). For instance, if one estimates the population correlation (ρ) to be 0.30, and desires statistical power equal to 0.80, then to obtain a significance level of α less than 0.05, the sample size requirement would be N = 70 cases rounded up (more precisely approximately 68 cases using interpolation). =Other quick nomograms= Nomogram for the law of sines Nomogram for solving the quadratric x^2+px+q=0 Nomogram for solving the cubic x^3+px+q=0 Using a ruler, one can readily read the missing term of the law of sines or the roots of the quadratic and cubic equation.

History The lyrics come from a poem written in the 1930s by Lebanese-born Egyptian poet Mostafa Saadeq Al-Rafe'ie. Although some say the melody was composed by Mohammed Abdel Wahab,National Anthems of the World Organisation Tunisian musicologist Salah El Mahdi claims the melody was composed by the poet while the original music for the poem was composed by Zakariyya Ahmad. Students of the World The last verses of the lyrics were written by Aboul-Qacem Echebbi. According to El Mahdi, these verses were appended to the lyrics in June 1955 by nationalist Mongi Slim. Known as the \\"Hymn of the Revolution\\", it was sung during the meetings of the ruling party, the Neo Destour which later changed its name to Socialist Destourian Party. \\"Humat al-Hima\\" was temporarily used as a national anthem between the end of the monarchy on 25 July 1957 and the adoption of \\"Ala Khallidi\\" as the official national anthem on 20 March 1958, when it replaced the Salam al-Bey. \\"Humat al-Hima\\" was later replaced by \\"Ala Khallidi\\" but brought back again following the coup d'état which brought president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to power on 7 November 1987.

Life Born at Tarsus in Cilicia of a noble family, he was widely known for his admirable character. When Gregory resigned as Archbishop of Constantinople, Nectarius was praetor of Constantinople. Preparing for a journey to Tarsus, he called on the Bishop of Tarsus, Diodore, who was attending the First Council of Constantinople (one of the ecumenical councils), to ask if he could take letters for him; his appearance and manners struck Diodorus so forcibly that he at once determined that he should be advanced as a candidate for Bishop; making an excuse of attending to some other business, he took Nectarius to see Meletius.Fortescue, Adrian. \\"Nectarius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 25 Feb. 2014 His unexpected appointment When the Emperor Theodosius I wanted the Bishops at the Council to suggest new candidates and reserving to himself the right of making the choice, the Bishop of Antioch put at the bottom of his list, Nectarius' name. The Emperor having read the lists, declared Nectarius to be his choice. This caused some amazement amongst the Fathers who wanted to know who and what this Nectarius was. He was still only a catechumen. There was much astonishment at the emperor's unexpected choice, but the people of Constantinople were delighted at the news as was the whole council. Nectarius was duly baptized and his clothes were changed for the robes of a Bishop of the Imperial city and became at once president of the Second Ecumenical Council. Nectarius ruled the church for upwards of 16 years, and is thought of as having been a good prelate. His name heads the 150 signatures to the canons of the Second Ecumenical Council. The 3rd canon declares that, \\"...the Bishop of Constantinople shall hold the first rank after the bishop of Rome, because Constantinople is the new Rome.\\" Dissent threatens Unfortunately the Bishops of the West opposed the election result and asked for a common synod of East and West to settle the succession and so the Emperor Theodosius, soon after the close of the second council, summoned the Imperial Bishops to a fresh synod at Constantinople; nearly all of the same bishops who had attended the earlier second council were assembled again in early summer of 382. On arrival they received a letter from the synod of Milan, inviting them to a great general council at Rome; however they indicated that they must remain where they were, because they had not made any preparations for such long a journey. However, they sent three --Syriacus, Eusebius and Priscian—with a synodal letter to Pope Damasus I, archbishop Saint Ambrose and the other bishops assembled in the council at Rome. The Roman synod to which this letter was addressed was the fifth under Damasus. No formal account remains of its proceedings, nor of how its members treated the question of Nectarius. Theodosius, did however, send commissaries to Rome in support of his synod. In his 15th letter (to the bishops of Illyria) he indicated that the church in Rome had finally agreed to recognize both Nectarius and Flavian. Six letters from Nectarius remain extant in the files of his predecessor Gregory Nazianzus. In the first he expresses his hearty good wishes for his episcopate. The last is of great importance, urging him not to be too liberal in tolerating the Apollinarians. In 383 a third synod at Constantinople was held. In spite of the decrees of bishops and emperor, the Arians and Pneumatomachians continued to spread their doctrines. Theodosius summoned all parties to the Imperial city for a great discussion in June, hoping to reconcile all differences. Before this he had sent for the Archbishop and told him that all questions should be fully debated. After this, Nectarius returned home, full of anxiety and consulted the Novatianist Bishop Agelius, who felt himself unsuited to arbitrate on such a controversy. However he did have a reader, Sisinnius, a philosopher and theologian, to whom he referred the argument with the Arians. Sisinnius suggested that they should produce the testimonies of the old Fathers of the Church on the doctrine of the Son, and first ask the heads of the several parties whether they accepted these authorities or desired to anathematize them. Both the Archbishop and the Emperor agreed to this suggestion and when the Bishops met, the Emperor asked whether they respected \\"...the teachers who lived before the Arian division?\\" They confirmed that they did and he then asked if they acknowledged, \\"...them sound and trustworthy witnesses of the true Christian doctrine?\\". This question however produced divisions and so the emperor ordered each party to draw up a written confession of its doctrine. When this was done, the Bishops were summoned to the Imperial palace, where the emperor received them with kindness and retired to his study with their written confessions. Theodosius however rejected and destroyed all except that of the orthodox, because he felt that the others introduced a division into the Holy Trinity. After this, Theodosius forbade all sectaries, except the Novatianists, to hold divine services or to publish their doctrines or to ordain clergy, under threat of severe civil penalties. In 385 the emperor's wife Aelia Flaccilla (or Placilla) and their daughter Pulcheria died. The archbishop asked Gregory of Nyssa to preach the funeral sermons for both of them. Towards the close of his episcopate, Nectarius abolished the office of presbyter penitentiary, whose duty appears to have been to receive confessions before communion. His example was followed by nearly all other Bishops. The presbyter penitentiary was added to the ecclesiastical roll about the time of the Novatianist schism, when that party declined to communicate with those who had lapsed in the Decian persecution. Gradually there were fewer lapsed to reconcile, and his duties became more closely connected with preparation for communion. Nectarius abolished the office due to a scandal that had occurred in connection with it.Butler, Alban and Burns, Paul. Butler's Lives of the Saints, Vol. 10, A&C; Black, 1995 Nectarius died in office on 17 September 397Nectarius Ecumenical Patriarchate (Butler says 27 September) and was succeeded by Saint John Chrysostom.

The missile had GRAU indices of 3M65, 3M20, and 3R65. It was carried on board Typhoon-class submarines. An intercontinental missile, the R-39 had a three-stage solid-fuel boost design with a liquid-fuel post-boost unit carrying up to ten multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle warheads. Like other SLBMs the initial launch was powered by a gas generator in the bottom of the firing tube. During the missile's passage through the water additional motors produce a gaseous wall around the missile, reducing hydrodynamic resistance. The launch system was designated \\"D-19\\". Development Development work began at NII Mashinostroyeniya in 1971 and the design gained official approval in 1973. Initial test flights from 1979 found problems in the solid-fuel boost engines, over half of the early flights failed. Later tests aboard a modified Typhoon- class submarine were more successful and deployment began in May 1983, with 20 missiles in each submarine. At full deployment, 120 missiles were deployed with 1,200 total warheads. Under the terms of the START I and START II treaties, from 1996 a number of R-39 missiles were destroyed. Throughout the 1990s, Typhoon class submarines and the R-39 missiles they carried were gradually withdrawn from service.

It was developed over ten years by Nikon, in parallel with other manufacturer's development of CMOS, and resulted in shipping product in 2003. Both CMOS and LBCAST technologies branched from researchers discussions of \\"amplifying sensors\\" as a way to develop an imaging sensor with lower power requirements than the already-existing CCD sensor technology, for use in portable devices such as DSLR cameras. From the Nikon Website: : \\"In July 2003, Nikon introduced LBCAST- a completely new type of image sensor, different from CCD and CMOS, that is a high-speed, power- efficient, low-noise device to be installed in Nikon's flagship camera, the D2Hs.\\" : \\"... Compared with conventional sensors, it saves more power and achieves less dark noise. (Dark noise is a phenomenon in which randomly spaced bright pixels appear in images due to the heat from the image device during shooting). Also, LBCAST increases image processing speed and improves sensitivity, contrast and color reproduction.\\"  Comparison between LBCAST and CMOS photo sensors  The main differences between LBCAST and CMOS-based sensors appear to be those given below: * LBCAST divides the photosites to be read out into two channels by colour, red and blue photosites—making up 50% of the total number of photosites between them, as in CMOS and CCD colour sensors—accumulate using one read-channel, while green photosites—which make up the other 50% of total pixels, as in CMOS and CCD—accumulate in a dedicated channel. : This division is to speed reading, and the separation of green pixels, to which the human eye is most sensitive, reduces noise artifacts which might otherwise be introduced by residual electrical charge in the accumulation circuitry, acquired previously from reading a pixel of a different colour. : Red and blue are significantly less important in human sight, and so presumably a decision was made not to keep separate read channels for the two colours, in order to simplify the circuit design for practical use -- at least in the described version of LBCAST technology. * Each photosite in LBCAST uses a single JFET transistor in place of two MOSFET transistors used for the separate tasks of photosite read-out selection and signal amplification, in CMOS technology. In total, CMOS uses four transistors per photosite, where LBCAST manages with three. * Charge to be (re-)distributed between components in the sensor during use are channeled via the LBCAST lower layers, where CMOS channels this charge over the surface layer. This difference is also claimed to reduce the presence of noise artifacts. * The simpler circuitry required translates into more space for light to be received, since wiring and opaque masking takes less space. * The simpler circuitry required translates into fewer layers of material in the silicon chip meaning that tangential light requires less correction in order to traverse to the depth at which the photons result in signal, simplifying the need for lensing at each pixel or photosite, and therefore theoretically, attaining greater image uniformity.  Uses of LBCAST sensors  As at end 2006, the Nikon D2H and the D2Hs were the only publicly available cameras known to carry the sensor. Nikon has opted to use CCDs sourced from Sony in most of their low and mid range cameras and used a CMOS sensor in the flagship D2Xs/D2x. The LBCAST sensor in the D2Hs has remained at 4.1MP. With the advent of the D3, D700 and D300 cameras in 2007 and 2008, all featuring CMOS sensor technology, it is unknown whether LBCAST plays a part in the design of the CMOS sensor of either, since Nikon's implementation of LBCAST is an adaptation of CMOS, and it is therefore technically correct to refer to the known instances of LBCAST as CMOS, Nikon has not been forthcoming to requests for specific information on the D3 sensor and Nikon have claimed in the past that LBCAST would be further developed.  Criticisms of LBCAST sensors  The following weaknesses have been cited as affecting the Nikon D2H, although whether these issues have origins specific to LBCAST, and whether LBCAST necessitates these problems, is not known. * Colour cast—generally (and by definition) colour correction is a fundamental requirement of imaging in any medium where incident light quality is variable, including unaided human vision, and so this possibly a software issue. * Infra-red pollution—incident infra-red light is usually filtered on image sensors, using a specific thin film dedicated to this task (but which may serve an additional purpose in protecting the relatively much more expensive sensor component from contamination and damage), and so this issue, if truly the result of ir pollution, may be a problem which is independent of the LBCAST technology of the sensor. * Low resolution—it is not known whether the relatively low resolution of the D2H and D2Hs in comparison with other professional cameras of the day is a technological limitation of LBCAST, a business management or marketing decision, or whether it has other causes such as gradual ramping-up of manufacturing capability of a new technology by Nikon, who did not appear previously to have the capacity to have novel sensors manufactured to their specification. It is known that there is a market for high-speed, power efficient cameras where higher resolution is not required, for example newspaper journalism.

She is married to Tony Blair, who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007. Early life and education Booth was born in 23 September 1954 at Fairfield General Hospital, Bury, Lancashire, England,Blair, Cherie (2008), p. 9. and brought up in Ferndale Road, Waterloo, Merseyside, just north of Liverpool. Although her birth was registered as 'Cherie', owing to her maternal grandmother's influence, she was christened 'Theresa Cara' in deference to the requirement that she be given a saint's name. Her father, British actor Tony Booth, left her mother, actress Gale Howard (née Joyce Smith; 14 February 1933 – 5 June 2016), when Cherie was 8 years old. Cherie and her younger sister Lyndsey were then brought up by Gale and their paternal grandmother Vera Booth, a devout Roman Catholic of Irish descent. The sisters attended Catholic schools in Crosby, Merseyside. Cherie Booth attended Seafield Convent Grammar, which is now part of Sacred Heart Catholic College, where she achieved 4 Grade-A GCE A Level passes. She read law at the London School of Economics and graduated with First-Class Honours. Later she was enrolled at the College of Law and passed her Bar Vocational Course.West, Karl (26 February 2012). \\"Law school's £200m sale\\" . Sunday Times. Retrieved 2 June 2016 (subscription needed for full access). She came at the top of her year in the bar exams, while teaching law at the Polytechnic of Central London (University of Westminster). She was the Labour candidate for the Conservative safe seat of North Thanet in Kent in the 1983 general election, losing to Roger Gale. Legal career A member of Lincoln's Inn, she became a barrister in 1976 and Queen's Counsel in 1995. Until 1988, her head of chambers was George Carman. In 1999, she was appointed a recorder (a permanent part-time judge) in the County Court and Crown Court. She was a founding member of Matrix Chambers in London but no longer practises there. Matrix was formed in 2000 specialising in human rights law, though members also practise in a range of areas of UK public and private law, the Law of the European Union and European Convention on Human Rights, and public international law. She is Founder and Chair of law firm Omnia Strategy LLP. She specialises in employment, discrimination, and public law and, in this capacity, has occasionally represented claimants taking cases against the UK Government. Blair has appeared in a number of leading cases. A notable example before the European Court of Justice was concerned with discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. In January 2010, when sentencing a defendant, Shamso Miah, for assault, Booth announced that she would suspend his prison sentence after describing him as a \\"religious man\\". The court heard that Miah had been to a mosque shortly before he broke a man's jaw following a row in a bank queue. Blair told Miah: \\"You are a religious man and you know this is not acceptable behaviour.\\" This was interpreted by some observers as special leniency given on account of the criminal's religiosity. The Office for Judicial Complaints released an initial statement saying they had \\"received a number of complaints in relation to the comments\\" that Blair had made when sentencing Shamso Miah and that the matter was under investigation. On 10 June 2010, the OJC released a statement saying that the investigation had \\"found that Recorder Booth's observations did not constitute judicial misconduct\\" and accordingly \\"no disciplinary action is necessary\\". A private letter to the National Secular Society said, however, that the OJC had taken action in the form of \\"informal advice\\" from a more senior judge. In 2015, Blair defended Rwandan spy chief Emmanuel Karenzi Karake against accusations that he had conspired to murder three Spanish NGO workers and a Canadian priest. Karake had allegedly done so because the workers knew about the Rwandan Patriotic Front killing Hutu civilians in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Blair launched a company called Mee Healthcare with an American business partner Gail Lese in 2011. In June 2015, it ceased trading and all staff were dismissed without notice. Career in academia Blair was the 3rd Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University from 1999 to 2006. On 26 July 2006, she was awarded the honorary title of Emerita Chancellor, as well as the university honorarily naming its new Cherie Booth Building. She is also Governor of the London School of Economics and the Open University. On 2 March 2011, Blair was appointed the Chancellor of the Asian University for Women. Blair is regularly invited to speak at legal and leadership conferences, and has in the past participated in the World Law Forum, ET Women's Forum, Yidan Prize Summit and the Commonwealth Africa Summit, amongst others. Honours and charity work In July 1999, Blair was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of the University (DUniv) from the Open University. Blair is a patron of Breast Cancer Care, a UK breast cancer information and support charity, Jospice, the international hospice organisation based in her home town of Crosby, and disability charity Scope. She is also involved with the British branch of Child in Need India (CINI UK), and is the organisation's patron. In 2008, she launched her foundation, the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, a development organisation that aims to support women entrepreneurs in developing countries. \\"Our mission is to provide women with the skills, technology, networks and access to capital that they need to become successful small and growing business owners, so that they can contribute to their economies and have a stronger voice in their societies,\\" says its mission statement. In 2010, Blair spoke at WE Day, an event held by WE Charity as part of their ongoing effort to empower youth and encourage them to get involved in their communities. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to women's issues and charity. In June 2018, “Cherie Blair Foundation for Women” was inducted into Power Brands LIFE – Hall of Fame at the London International Forum for Equality. Controversies In January 2000, Blair avoided paying her train fare on a Thameslink train from London to Luton and was fined £10 plus the fare due. In 2002, Blair purchased two flats in Bristol with the assistance, it was alleged but later denied, of Peter Foster, a convicted Australian conman and boyfriend of Blair's friend Carole Caplin, who negotiated a discount for Blair.\\"Cherie says 'sorry' for Foster dealings\\" , BBC, 10 December 2002. Blair publicly apologised for her embarrassing connection to Foster, stating \\"I did not think it was my business to choose my friends' friends\\". Her relationship with Caplin gave rise to headlines in some newspapers, as Caplin is credited with introducing Blair to various New Age symbols and beliefs. Reports of Blair's New Age practices included an account of her 2001 holiday in Mexico, when she and her husband, wearing only swimming costumes, privately took part in a rebirthing procedure that involved smearing mud and fruit over each other's bodies while sitting in a steam bath.How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World, Francis Wheen, Harper Perennial 2004, In 2002, she apologised after saying within hours of a Jerusalem blast that killed at least 19 people in reference to the Palestinian suicide bombers: \\"As long as young people feel they have no hope but to blow themselves up, we're never going to make progress, are we?\\" On 12 December 2008, Blair gave a lecture alternatively entitled \\"The Church and Women's Rights: time for a fresh perspective?\\" accessed 1 December 2014. or \\"Religion as a Force in protecting Women's Human Rights\\" at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum, in Rome. accessed 1 December 2014. In summer 2015, in the wake of the Hillary Clinton email controversy, Blair was revealed by The Guardian to have lobbied Clinton in 2009 on behalf of prominent members of the Qatari monarchy; Clinton was US Secretary of State at the time.telegraph.co.uk: \\"Hillary Clinton may have broken US secrecy rules with emails from Tony Blair and Downing Street\\" , 1 September 2015. In a letter to the newspaper, Blair denied this characterisation of her mediation efforts, describing their story as \\"sensationalist and inaccurate\\". Precisely two months later, the release of another batch of Clinton's private emails confirmed that Blair had, indeed, arranged meetings with Clinton for the Qataris outside normal diplomatic channels, with discussions to involve \\"the US/Qatar relationship generally\\", not merely joint philanthropic efforts. In one case, Blair herself stated that her purpose was to help the eldest of Sheikha Mosah's sons, Jasim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, \\"build up an international profile\\". In summer 2015, Blair's law firm accepted a large fee to advise the Maldives government as it faced a challenge from former Maldivian president Mohamed Nasheed over his imprisonment for \\"terrorism\\". Nasheed, who served from 2008 to 2012 as his country's first democratically elected leader, is seeing out a 13-year prison sentence after a widely criticised trial. Personal life =Family= Red Bull Air Race in 2007 in London In 1976, while she was studying to become a barrister, she met future Prime Minister and husband Tony Blair. She obtained a pupillage in the chambers of Derry Irvine ahead of him, although he was also taken on. Married on 29 March 1980, the Blairs have three sons and one daughter: Euan (born 1984), Nicholas (born 1985), Kathryn (born 1988), and Leo (born 2000). Leo was the first child born to the wife of a serving British Prime Minister in over 150 years, since Rollo Russell was born to Lady Frances Elliot-Murray- Kynynmound and Lord John Russell on 11 July 1849. Another pregnancy at the age of 47 ended in miscarriage in early August 2002. The Blair children attended Catholic secondary schools, including The London Oratory School. All four children have Irish passports, by virtue of Tony Blair's mother, Hazel Elizabeth Corscadden, a Protestant, the daughter of George Corscadden, a butcher and Orangeman who moved to Glasgow in 1916 but returned to Ballyshannon in 1923, where Hazel was born to George and Sarah Margaret (née Lipsett), above her family's grocery shop. Via her father, Blair and her younger sister Lyndsey have six half-sisters, including British journalist Lauren Booth. Her first grandchild (a girl) was born in October 2016. =Political and religious views= Blair has described herself as a socialist and, at times, has appeared to have views further to the left than those of her husband. In March 2008, she chaired the Street Weapons Commission on behalf of the broadcaster Channel 4. She toured the UK and took evidence from people affected by street crime and published a report and practical advice in June 2008. She is a practising Roman Catholic. In 2009, Blair urged the Catholic Church to reconsider its hardline stance against contraception, suggesting it could be holding some women back from pursuing a career. In George W. Bush's 2010 autobiography Decision Points, Blair is briefly described as a fierce opponent of the death penalty. Writings, portrayals, and coverage in books, film and theatre Blair co-authored, with Cate Haste, the 2004 book The Goldfish Bowl: Married to the Prime Minister. The book is a compilation history of the lives of spouses of British Prime Ministers for most of the second half of the 20th century. It covers the spouses of former prime ministers Anthony Eden, Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, and John Major. Blair wrote a book of her memoirs, published in late May 2008, entitled Speaking for Myself: The Autobiography,Blair, Cherie (2008). Book cover. and the book was listed as a Sunday Times best-seller. Interviewed about the book by Carole MacNeil on the Canadian network CBC Television on 1 June 2008, Blair stated that she felt most of the controversy about her in the British media was due to her pioneering role as the first wife of a British Prime Minister who had her own career, with the media simply not knowing how to treat her fairly and objectively.CBC Television, 1 June 2008; interview by Carole MacNeil. Played by Helen McCrory, Blair features as a character in The Queen (2006), starring Helen Mirren, about the aftermath of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, and is portrayed as a fierce anti-monarchist. McCrory played her again in the 2010 HBO film The Special Relationship. Blair also features as a character in Chris Bush and Ian McCluskey's production TONY! The Blair Musical. Phoebe Nicholls played her in The Trial of Tony Blair (2007). She was also a subject in \\"Shoot The Dog\\", a song by George Michael that was critical of the Iraq war. in June 2019, Blair signed on as executive producer for Jerusalem-set drama The Rock Pile, a first try into TV series production for her.

His memory is kept on 11 October. Biography He was the brother of Nectarius, Chrysostom's predecessor, and had served as archpresbyter under Chrysostom. cites (Photius C. 59) In earlier life his brother had selected him for the bishopric of Tarsus, and had attributed his refusal to an ambitious design of becoming his successor at Constantinople. On this, Palladius asserts, he swore voluntarily that he would never accept the see of Constantinople. cites Palladius c. xi. After he had passed his 80th year, the success of the intrigue of Aelia Eudoxia, queen of emperor Arcadius, and Theophilus, Patriarch of Alexandria, against Chrysostom opened an unexpected way for his elevation to the archiepiscopal throne. Eudoxia and the party now triumphant wanted for their new archbishop a facile tool, under whose authority they might shelter the violence of their proceedings. Such an instrument they had in Arsacius. Moreover, his hostility to Chrysostom had been sufficiently testified at the synod of the Oak, when he appeared as a witness against him and vehemently pressed his condemnation. He was consecrated archbishop on June 27, 404. Chrysostom, on hearing of it, denounced him \\"as a spiritual adulterer, and a wolf in sheep's clothing\\". cites Ep. cxxv. The diocese soon made it plain that they regarded the new archbishop as an intruder. With the exception of a few officials, the dependants of the court party, and the expectants of royal favour, the people of Constantinople refused to attend any religious assembly at which he might be expected to be present. Deserting the sacred edifices, they gathered in the outskirts of the city, and in the open air.\\"Arsacius\\", Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople Arsacius appealed to the emperor Arcadius, by whose orders, or rather those of Eudoxia, soldiers were sent to disperse the suburban assemblies. Those who had taken a leading part in them were apprehended and tortured, and a fierce persecution commenced of the adherents of Chrysostom. We learn from Sozomenus, cites Sozomenus H. E. viii. 23 that Arsacius was not personally responsible for these cruel deeds; but he lacked strength of character to offer any decided opposition to the proceedings of his clergy. They did what they pleased, and Arsacius bore the blame. Arsacius' position became intolerable. In vain all the bishops and clergy who, embracing Chrysostom's cause, had refused to recognize him were driven out of the East on November 18, 404. This only spread the evil more widely. The whole Western episcopate refused to acknowledge him, and Pope Innocent I, who had warmly espoused Chrysostom's interests, wrote to the clergy and laity of Constantinople strongly condemning the intrusion of Arsacius, and exhorting them to persevere in their adhesion to their true archbishop. Sozomenus, H. E. vi. 22, 26. It is no cause for surprise that Arsacius's episcopate was a brief one, and that a feeble character worn out by old age should have soon given way before a storm of opposition so universal. He died November 11, 405. References ;Attribution * **Chrysostom Ep. cxxv. **Palladius Dial. c.xi.; **Phot. C. 59; **Socrates Scholasticus H.E. vi. 19; **Sozomenus H.

President Mohammad Najibullah, whom the U.S. government predicted would not last the summer when Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan in February 1989, continues to rule his war-wracked nation from a precarious position. A Moscow- brokered plan calls for Najibullah to step aside in favor of Prime Minister Khaliqyar, who would serve as a transitional administrative leader until a new government could be elected. However, on October 13 moderate guerrilla officials in Pakistan highlight the remaining obstacles to peace by withdrawing their support for Khaliqyar. The mujaheddin say his association with Najibullah makes him unacceptable. Afghanistan is like a maimed patient after 13 years of civil war. The streets of Kabul are full of one-legged men, victims of land mines. The government says it has released more than 19,000 prisoners in the past four years and has abolished the special tribunals set up to try those accused of political crimes. Meanwhile, fierce fighting continues between government troops and the Muslim guerrillas. The guerrillas launch their long-planned assault on Najibullah's hometown, the garrison town of Gardez in southeastern Afghanistan, and coordinate a series of attacks aimed at demoralizing the Afghan Army and destabilizing the government, but none of the attacks is decisive. In 1991 the guerrillas control 6 of Afghanistan's 31 provinces. In their only major gain during the year, they overrun a series of government-held garrisons to gain control of strategic areas along the border with the breakaway Soviet republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. They also hold the narrow corridor linking Afghanistan with China.

The plan calls for an end to weapons shipments to the warring factions, a cease-fire, and an intra-Afghan dialogue leading to the formation of a national unity government mandated to oversee elections. The national unity government would share power with the Pakistan- based government-in-exile, guerrilla commanders, Afghans living in exile, and the deposed king, Zahir Shah. Besides organizing elections, it would rewrite Afghanistan's constitution and oversee the return of the more than five million refugees who had fled to Pakistan and Iran. However, the Muslim guerrillas accuse Najibullah of merely repackaging old ideas in order to portray himself as a peacemaker. Most of the guerrillas vow to continue fighting until he is overthrown. = September = In a surprise move, the government restores the citizenship of Zahir Shah, who has been living in virtual banishment in Italy for 18 years. Nearly 77, Zahir Shah had been overthrown in 1973, and he and his family were stripped of their Afghan citizenship after the Communist revolution of 1978. Zahir Shah is under pressure from the Western countries (including the United States) not to respond to Najibullah's call for National Reconciliation because if Zahir Shah returns to Afghanistan and joins the government, most of the traditionalist mujahideen would quit fighting against the government and would probably join the government. In mid-September the U.S. and the Soviet Union take the first step toward a negotiated settlement by agreeing to end arms shipments to their respective clients, the rebels and the government in Kabul, as of January 1, 1992.

He was the founder of the Triratna Buddhist Community, which was known until 2010 as the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order, or FWBO. He was one of a handful of westerners to be ordained as Theravadin Bhikkhus in the period following World War II, and spent over 20 years in Asia, where he had a number of Tibetan Buddhist teachers. In India, he was active in the conversion movement of Dalits—so- called \\"Untouchables\\"—initiated in 1956 by B. R. Ambedkar. He wrote more than 60 books, including compilations of his talks, and was described as \\"one of the most prolific and influential Buddhists of our era,\\" \\"a skilled innovator in his efforts to translate Buddhism to the West,\\" and as \\"the founding father of Western Buddhism\\" for his role in setting up what is now the Triratna Buddhist Community, but Sangharakshita was often regarded as a controversial teacher. He was criticised for having had sexual relations with Order members, which allegedly amounted to abuse and coercion. Sangharakshita retired formally in 1995 and in 2000 stepped down from the movement's ostensive leadership, but he remained its dominant figure and lived at its headquarters in Coddington, Herefordshire. The Triratna Order Office announced the death of Sangharakshita after a short illness on 30 October 2018. Early life Sangharakshita was born Dennis Philip Edward Lingwood in Tooting, London, in 1925. After being diagnosed with a heart condition he spent much of his childhood confined to bed, and used the opportunity to read widely. His first encounter with non-Christian thought was with Madame Helena Blavatsky's Isis Unveiled, upon reading which, he later said, he realised that he had never been a Christian. The following year he came across two Buddhist texts—the Diamond Sutra and the Platform Sutra—and concluded that he had always been a Buddhist. As Dennis Lingwood, he joined the Buddhist Society at the age of 18, and formally became a Buddhist in May 1944 by taking the Three Refuges and Five Precepts from the Burmese monk, U Thittila. He was conscripted into the army in 1943, and served in India, Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) and Singapore as a radio engineer in the Royal Corps of Signals. It was in Sri Lanka, while in contact with the swamis in the (Hindu) Ramakrishna Mission, that he developed the desire to become a monk. In 1946, after the cessation of hostilities, he was transferred to Singapore, where he made contact with Buddhists and learned to meditate. India Having been conscripted into the British Army and posted to India, at the end of the war Sangharakshita handed in his rifle, left the camp where he was stationed and deserted. He moved about in India for a few years, with a Bengali novice Buddhist, the future Buddharakshita, as his companion, meditating and experiencing for himself the company of eminent spiritual personalities of the times, like Mata Anandamayi, Ramana Maharishi and Swamis of Ramakrishna Mission. They spent fifteen months in 1947–48, in the Ramakrishna Mission centre at Muvattupuzha with the consent of Swami Tapasyananda and Swami Agamananda. In May 1949 he became a novice monk, or sramanera, in a ceremony conducted by the Burmese monk, U Chandramani, who was then the most senior monk in India. It was then that he was given the name Sangharakshita (Pali: Sangharakkhita), which means \\"protected by the spiritual community.\\" Sangharakshita took full bhikkhu ordination the following year, with another Burmese bhikkhu, U Kawinda, as his preceptor (upādhyāya), and with the Ven. Jagdish Kashyap as his teacher (ācārya). He studied Pali, Abhidhamma, and Logic with Jagdish Kashyap at Benares (Varanasi) University. In 1950, at Kashyap's suggestion, Sangharakshita moved to the hill town of Kalimpong close to the borders of India, Bhutan, Nepal. and Sikkim, and only a few miles from Tibet. Kalimpong was his base for 14 years until his return to England in 1966. During his time in Kalimpong, Sangharakshita formed a young men's Buddhist association and established an ecumenical centre for the practice of Buddhism (the Triyana Vardhana Vihara). He also edited the Maha Bodhi Journal and established a magazine, Stepping Stones. In 1951, Sangharakshita met the German-born Lama Govinda, who was the first Buddhist Sangharakshita had known \\"to declare openly the compatibility of art with the spiritual life\\", and who gave Sangharakshita a greater appreciation for Tibetan Buddhism. Govinda had begun his explorations of Buddhism in the Theravada tradition, studying briefly under the German-born bhikkhu, Nyanatiloka Mahathera (who gave him the name Govinda), but after meeting the Gelug Lama, Tomo Geshe Rinpoche, in 1931, he turned towards Tibetan Buddhism. Sangharakshita's spiritual explorations were to follow a similar trajectory. Sangharakshita was ordained in the Theravada school, but said he became disillusioned by what he felt was the dogmatism, formalism, and nationalism of many of the Theravadin bhikkhus he met and became increasingly influenced by Tibetan Buddhist teachers who had fled Tibet after the Chinese invasion in the 1950s. Two years after his meeting with Lama Govinda he began studying with the Gelug Lama, Dhardo Rinpoche. Sangharakshita also received initiations and teachings from teachers who included Jamyang Khyentse, Dudjom Rinpoche, as well as Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. It was Dhardo Rinpoche who was to give Sangharakshita Mayahana ordination. Later, Sangharakshita also studied with a Ch'an teacher, Yogi Chen (Chen Chien-Ming), along with another English monk, Bhikkhu Khantipalo. Together, the three men turned their ongoing seminar on Buddhist theory and practice into a book, Buddhist Meditation, Systematic and Practical. In 1952, Sangharakshita met Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (1891–1956), the chief architect of the Indian constitution and India's first law minister. Ambedkar, who had been a so- called Untouchable, converted to Buddhism, along with 380,000 other Untouchables (now known as \\"dalits\\") on 14 October 1956. Ambedkar and Sangharakshita had been in correspondence since 1950, and the Indian politician had encouraged the young monk to expand his Buddhist activities. Ambedkar appreciated Sangharakshita's \\"commitment to a more critically engaged Buddhism that did not at the same time dilute the cardinal precepts of Buddhist thought\\". Ambedkar initially invited Sangharakshita to perform his conversion ceremony, but the latter refused, arguing that U Chandramani should preside. Ambedkar died six weeks later, leaving his conversion movement leaderless, and Sangharakshita, who had just arrived in Nagpur to visit dalit Buddhists, continued what he felt was Ambedkar's work by lecturing to former Untouchables, and presiding over a ceremony in which a further 200,000 Untouchables converted. For the next decade, Sangharakshita spent much of his time visiting dalit Buddhist communities in western India. Return to the West In 1964, Sangharakshita was invited to help with a dispute at the Hampstead Buddhist Vihara in north London, where he proved to be a popular teacher. His ecumenical approach and failure to conform to some of the trustees' expectations was said to contrast with the strict Theravadin-style Buddhism at the vihara. Although originally planning to stay only six months, he decided to settle in England, but after he returned to India for a farewell tour, the Vihara's trustees voted to expel him. Sangharakshita returned to England and in April 1967 founded the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order. The Western Buddhist Order was founded a year later, when he ordained the first dozen men and women. The first ordinations were attended by a Zen monk, a Shin priest and two Theravadin monks. Satisfied neither with the lay- Buddhist approach of the Buddhist Society, nor the monastic approach of the Hampstead vihara—the two dominant Buddhist organisations in Britain at that time—he created what he said was a new form of Buddhism. The order would be neither lay nor monastic, and members take a set of ten precepts that are a traditional part of Mahayana Buddhism. Initially, Sangharakshita led all classes and conducted all ordinations. He gave lectures drawing on what he felt were the essential teachings of all the major Buddhist schools. He led major retreats twice a year and frequent day and weekend events. As the order grew, and centres became established across Britain and in other countries, order members took more responsibility until, in August 2000, he devolved his responsibilities as the head of the Western Buddhist Order to eight men and women who formed what was called the \\"College of Public Preceptors.\\" In 2005 Sangharakshita donated all of his books and artefacts, with an insurance value of £314,400, to the charitable trust dedicated to his 'support and assistance' as well as enabling his office to 'maintain contact with his disciples and friends worldwide' and to 'support them in activities'.ADM of Triratna Buddhist Community (Uddiyana), 2015, Charity Commission for England and Wales. Retrieved 14 April 2017. In 2015 this trust had an income of £140K, and for 2016 it was £73K. Sangharakshita died, aged 93, on 30 October 2018 after a short illness.Triratna Buddhist Order Website. Sangharakshita Memorial Space. https://thebuddhistcentre.com/sangharakshita?display=team Sexual misconduct In 1997, Sangharakshita became the focus for controversy when The Guardian newspaper published complaints concerning some of his sexual relationships with FWBO members during the 1970s and 1980s. For a decade following these public revelations, he declined to give any response to concerns from within the movement that he had misused his position as a Buddhist teacher to sexually exploit young men. He later addressed the controversy, stressing that his sexual partners were, or appeared to be, willing, and he expressed regret for any mistakes. Contributions and legacy Ven. Rewata Dhamma, Sangharakshita and Thich Nhat Hanh at the European Buddhist Union Congress, Berlin, 1992 Sangharakshita has been described as \\"among the first Westerners who devoted their life to the practice as well as the spreading of Buddhism\\" and also as a \\"prolific writer, translator, and practitioner of Buddhism\\". As a Westerner seeking to use Western concepts to communicate Buddhism, he has been compared to Teilhard de Chardin, termed \\"the founding father of Western Buddhism,\\" and noted as \\"a skilled innovator in his efforts to translate Buddhism to the West.\\" For Sangharakshita, as with other Buddhists, the factor that unites all Buddhist schools is not any particular teaching, but the act of \\"going for refuge\\" (sarana-gamana), which he regards \\"not simply as a formula but as a life- changing event\\" and as an ongoing \\"reorientation of one's life away from mundane concerns to the values embodied in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.\\" Any decisive act upon the spiritual path—renunciation, ordination, initiation, the attainment of Stream Entry, and the arising of the bodhicitta—are manifestations or examples of Going for Refuge. Among his distinctive views is his use of the scientific theory of evolution as a metaphor for spiritual development, referring to biological evolution as the \\"lower evolution\\" and spiritual development as being a form of self-directed \\"higher evolution\\". Though he considers women and men equally capable of Enlightenment and ordained them equally right from the start, he has also said he had \\"tentatively reached the conclusion that the spiritual life is more difficult for women because they are less able than men to envisage...something purely transcendental...\\"Transforming Self and World, 1995, p117 He also criticised heterosexual nuclear relationships as tending to neuroticism. The FWBO has been accused of cult-like behaviour in the 1970s and 80s for encouraging heterosexual men to engage in sexual relationships with men in order to get over their fear of intimacy with men and obtain spiritual growth. He has drawn parallels between Buddhism and the spirit of the Romantics, who believed that what art reveals has great moral and spiritual significance, and has written of \\"the religion of art.\\" Including compilations of his talks, Sangharakshita has authored more than 60 books. Meanwhile, the Triratna Buddhist Community, which he founded as the FWBO, has been described as \\"perhaps the most successful attempt to create an ecumenical international Buddhist organization\\". The community is one of the three largest Buddhist movements in Britain, and has a presence in Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa. More than a fifth of all Order members, as of 2006, were in India, where Dr. Ambedkar's mission to convert dalits to Buddhism continues. Martin Baumann, a scholar of Buddhism, has estimated that there are 100,000 people worldwide who are affiliated with the Triratna Buddhist Community. For Buddhologist Francis Brassard, Sangharakshita's major contribution is \\"without doubt his attempt to translate the ideas and practices of [Buddhism] into Western languages.\\" The non-denominational nature of the Triratna Buddhist Community, its equal ordination for both men and women, and its evolution of new forms of shared practice, such as what it calls team-based right livelihood projects, have been cited as examples of such \\"translation\\", and also as the creation of a \\"Buddhist society in miniature within the Western, industrialized world\\". For Martin Baumann, the Triratna Buddhist Community serves as proof that \\"Western concepts, such as a capitalistic work ethos, ecological considerations, and a social-reformist perspective, can be integrated into the Buddhist tradition\\".

In July 2003 he had an off-the-record conversation with Andrew Gilligan, a BBC journalist; during their discussion they talked about the 2002 dossier on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, which stated that some of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons were deployable within 45 minutes. When Gilligan reported this on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he stated that the 45 minute claim was included at the insistence of Alastair Campbell, the Downing Street Director of Communications—something Kelly denied. The government complained to the BBC about the claim, but they refused to recant on the claim; political tumult between Downing Street and the BBC developed. Kelly informed his line managers in the MoD that he may have been the source, but did not think he was the only one, as Gilligan had reported points he had not mentioned. Kelly's name became known to the media, and he was called to appear on 15 July before the parliamentary Intelligence and Security and Foreign Affairs Select committees. Two days later Kelly was found dead near his home. A former head of the Defence Microbiology Division working at Porton Down, Kelly was part of a joint US-UK team that inspected civilian biotechnology facilities in Russia in the early 1990s and concluded that were running a covert and illegal BW programme. He was appointed to the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in 1991 as one of its chief weapons inspectors in Iraq and led ten of the organisation's missions between May 1991 and December 1998. He also worked with UNSCOM's successor, the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and led several of their missions into Iraq. During his time with UNMOVIC he was key in uncovering the anthrax production programme at the Salman Pak facility, and a BW programme run at Al Hakum. Following Kelly's suicide in 2003 Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, set up a government inquiry under Lord Hutton, a former Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. The inquiry concluded that Kelly had committed suicide by \\"cutting his left wrist and that his death was hastened by his taking Coproxamol tablets\\". Hutton also stated that no other parties were involved in Kelly's death. There was continued debate over the manner of Kelly's death, and the case was reviewed between 2010 and 2011 by Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General; he concluded that there was \\"overwhelmingly strong\\" evidence that Kelly committed suicide. The post-mortem and toxicology reports were released in 2010; both documents supported the conclusion of the Hutton Inquiry. The manner of Kelly's death has been the subject of several documentaries and has been fictionalised on television, on stage and in print. He was appointed as Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1994 and might well have been under consideration for a knighthood in May 2003, according to Hutton. His work in Iraq earned him a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. Biography =Early life, education and first jobs: 1944–1984= Linacre College, Oxford, where Kelly studied for his doctorate in microbiology David Christopher Kelly was born in Llwynypia, Glamorgan, South Wales, on 14 May 1944. His parents were Thomas John Kelly and Margaret, ' Williams; Thomas was a schoolteacher who was serving in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as a signals officer during the Second World War. Thomas and Margaret divorced in 1951 and she took her young son and moved in with her parents in Pontypridd. From the age of eleven he attended the local grammar school. He was a keen sportsman and musician at school, and represented Wales in the youth cross-country running team; he played double bass in the National Youth Orchestra of Wales and played the saxophone to a high standard. In 1963 Kelly was admitted to the University of Leeds to study chemistry, botany and biophysics. His mother died two years later from an overdose of prescription barbiturates. Although the coroner's inquest gave an open verdict, Kelly believed she had killed herself. As a result of the death, Kelly suffered from insomnia and was prescribed sleeping pills; he was also given an extra year to complete his degree. Kelly graduated in 1967 with a BSc in bacteriology; he then obtained an MSc in virology from the University of Birmingham. Between his first and second degrees, on 15 July 1967, he married Janice Vawdrey, who was studying at Bingley Teacher Training College. Kelly joined the Insect Pathology Unit at the University of Oxford in 1968, while a student of Linacre College. In 1971 he received his doctorate in microbiology for his thesis \\"The Replication of Some Iridescent Viruses in Cell Cultures\\". In the early 1970s he undertook postdoctoral research at the University of Warwick, before moving back to Oxford in the mid-1970s to work at the Institute of Virology, where he rose to the position of Chief Scientific Officer. Much of his work was in the field of insect viruses. =Porton Down, Russia and Iraq: 1984–2003= Gruinard Island, which Kelly assisted with decontaminating from weaponised anthrax In 1984 Kelly joined the Ministry of Defence (MoD), as the head of the Defence Microbiology Division working at Porton Down, Wiltshire. The department had only a small number of microbiologists when he arrived, and most of their work involved the decontamination of Gruinard Island, which had been used for experiments during the Second World War with weaponised anthrax. He increased the scope of his department, obtaining additional funding to undertake research into biodefence. Because of the work undertaken by Kelly and his team, the UK were able to deploy a biodefence capability during the 1990–1991 Gulf War. Russia: 1991–1994 In 1989 Vladimir Pasechnik, the senior Soviet biologist and bioweapons developer, defected to the UK and provided intelligence about the clandestine biological warfare (BW) programme, Biopreparat. The programme was in contravention of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention which banned the production of chemical and biological weapons. Pasechnik was debriefed by the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS), who requested technical assistance to process the information on chemical and biological matters; Kelly was seconded to the DIS to assist with his colleagues Brian Jones and Christopher Davis. They debriefed Pasechnik over a period of three years. Stepnogorsk Scientific and Technical Institute for Microbiology, one of the Biopreparat facilities visited by Kelly Kelly undertook several visits to Russia between 1991 and 1994 as the co-lead of a team from the UK and US who inspected civilian biotechnology facilities in Russia. One of the restrictions placed on the inspectors was that visits could only be to non-military installations, so, for the first visit in January 1991, the team visited the Institute of Engineering Immunology, Lyubuchany; the State Research Centre for Applied Microbiology in Obolensk; the Vector State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo; and the Institute of Ultrapure Preparations, in what was then called Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). The team faced obstruction by the Russians, who tried to stop inspection of key areas of the facilities, and who lied about the use to which parts of the installations were put. On one visit to the Vector facility, Kelly had a conversation with a laboratory assistant—one who was too low grade to have been fully briefed by the KGB. Kelly asked the assistant about the work he was doing, and was surprised when the man said he was involved in testing smallpox. Kelly questioned Lev Sandakchiev, the head of Vector, about the use of smallpox, but received no answers. Kelly described the questioning sessions as \\"a very tense moment\\". In a 2002 review of the verification process, Kelly wrote: > The visits did not go without incident. At Obolensk, access to parts of the > main research facility—notably the dynamic aerosol test chambers and the > plague research laboratories—was denied on the spurious grounds of > quarantine requirements. Skirmishes occurred over access to an explosive > aerosol chamber because the officials knew that closer examination would > reveal damning evidence of offensive BW activities.

Candid and credible > accounts of many of the activities at these facilities were not provided. The official reports of the visit concluded that Soviets were running a covert and illegal BW programme. Kelly also took part in reciprocal visits to the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland, and visits to Porton Down by Russian and American inspectors. Despite their findings, Kelly concluded that the tripartite inspection programme had failed. It was, he said, \\"too ambitious; its disarmament objective deflected by issues of reciprocity and access to sites outside the territories of the three parties\\". He went on to add that \\"Russia's refusal to provide a complete account of its past and current BW activity and the inability of the American–British teams to gain access to Soviet/Russian military industrial facilities were significant contributory factors\\". Iraq: 1991 – May 2003 Appointment to UNSCOM Following the end of the Gulf War (August 1990 – February 1991), United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 imposed the articles of Iraq's surrender. The document stated \\"that Iraq shall unconditionally accept the destruction, removal, or rendering harmless, under international supervision, of ... All chemical and biological weapons\\". This was to be made possible by \\"The forming of a special commission which shall carry out immediate on-site inspection of Iraq's biological, chemical and missile capabilities, based on Iraq's declarations and the designation of any additional locations by the special commission itself\\". The group set up was the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), and Kelly was appointed to it in 1991 as one of its chief weapons inspectors in Iraq. The Iraqis had provided Rolf Ekéus, the director of UNSCOM, with a list of sites connected with the research and production of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) in the country, about half of which had been bombed during Operation Desert Storm. These sites provided the starting point for the investigations. In August 1991 Kelly led the first group of UN BW investigators into the country. When asked where the inspection teams would visit, he told reporters \\"We will go to sites which we deem to have characteristics associated with biological activity, but at the moment ... I have an open mind.\\" The first UNSCOM missions finished with no evidence found of an Iraqi biological or chemical programme, although they did establish that some sites suspected by US intelligence services of involvement in biological or chemical warfare research were legitimate. These included a bakery, a pharmaceutical research business in Samarra, a dairy and a slaughterhouse. A UN weapons inspector in Iraq, 2002 UNSCOM undertook 261 inspection missions to Iraq between May 1991 and December 1998, 74 of which were for biological weapons. Kelly led ten of the missions involved in BW inspections. In 1998 and 1999 Iraq refused to deal with UNSCOM or the inspectors; the country's President, Saddam Hussein, singled out Kelly by name for expulsion from the country. During an inspection mission to Iraq in 1998, Kelly worked alongside an American translator and US Air Force officer, Mai Pederson, who introduced him to the Baháʼí Faith. Kelly remained a member of the faith for the rest of his life, attending spiritual meetings near his home of Southmoor, Oxfordshire. He was, for a time, the treasurer of his local branch, based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. His time in Iraq left him with a deep affection for the country, its people and culture, although he abhorred Saddam's regime. British dossier on Iraqi WMD In 2000 UNSCOM was replaced by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), whose mission was similar to that of UNSCOM, and was to: > \\"continue with ... [UNSCOM's] mandate to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass > destruction ... and to operate a system of ongoing monitoring and > verification to check Iraq's compliance with its obligations not to > reacquire the same weapons prohibited to it by the Security Council. Kelly returned to work as a government advisor with the MoD on biological warfare, but also worked with UNMOVIC and continued to visit Iraq. He was involved in at least 36 missions to Iraq as part of UNSCOM and UNMOVIC, and, despite interference and obstruction tactics by the Iraqis, was instrumental in making the breakthrough to discover Iraq's BW facilities: the anthrax production programme at the Salman Pak facility and a BW programme run at Al Hakum. Hans Blix, the head of UNSCOM from March 2000 to June 2003 In his 2002 State of the Union address, George W. Bush, the President of the United States, discussed the use of WMD by the Iraqi regime and claimed that, along with Iran and North Korea, Iraq was part of an \\"axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world\\". Later that year he declared that \\"the stated policy of the United States is regime change\\". As part of the British government's arguments for war on Saddam, Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, published a dossier on Iraqi WMD on 24 September 2002. The dossier, which was \\"based, in large part, on the work of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC)\\", included the statement that the Iraqi government had: > * military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons, including > against its own Shia population. Some of these weapons are deployable within > 45 minutes of an order to use them; * command and control arrangements in > place to use chemical and biological weapons. Authority ultimately resides > with Saddam Hussein. Before its publication, Kelly had been shown a draft copy of the dossier and took part in a meeting at the DIS to review it. Four pages of comments were made regarding the information in the report, of which Kelly contributed twelve individual statements. The observations from the DIS were passed up to the Joint Intelligence Organisation; none of them referred to the 45-minute claim. On 8 November 2002 the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1441, \\"a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations under relevant resolutions of the Council; and accordingly decides to set up an enhanced inspection regime with the aim of bringing to full and verified completion the disarmament process\\". The resolution stated that the Iraqi government needed to provide full details of its WMD programme within 30 days. As a result of the increasing pressure on the Iraqi government, UNSCOM inspectors were readmitted to the country and information was provided on the Iraqi WMD programme. According to Kelly, despite the steps taken, Saddam \\"refuse[d] to acknowledge the extent of his chemical and biological weapons and associated military and industrial support organisations\\", and there was still a concern about \\"8,500 litres of anthrax VX, 2,160 kilograms of bacterial growth media, 360 tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agent, 6,500 chemical bombs and 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical and biological warfare agents [which] remained unaccounted for from activities up to 1991\\". Interaction with journalists Purported Iraqi mobile weapons laboratories, actually for production of hydrogen to fill weather balloons. In February 2003 Colin Powell, the US Secretary of State, addressed the United Nations Security Council to discuss Iraq's WMD. He included information on mobile weapons laboratories, which he described as \\"trucks and train cars ... easily moved and ... designed to evade detection by inspectors. In a matter of months, they can produce a quantity of biological poison equal to the entire amount that Iraq claimed to have produced in the years prior to the Gulf War.\\" Following his examination of the vehicles in question, Kelly spoke, off the record, to journalists from The Observer. In their article in the newspaper on 15 June 2003 they described him as \\"a British scientist and biological weapons expert\\", and quoted him as saying: > They are not mobile germ warfare laboratories. You could not use them for > making biological weapons. They do not even look like them. They are exactly > what the Iraqis said they were – facilities for the production of hydrogen > gas to fill balloons. One of the journalists who wrote the story, Peter Beaumont, confirmed to the Hutton Inquiry that Kelly was the source of this quote. Kelly was often approached by the press and would either clear the discussion with the press office of the FCO, or used his judgement before doing so; it was within his remit to liaise with the media. Shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq (20 March – 1 May 2003) Kelly anonymously wrote an article on the threat from Saddam which was never published. He outlined his thoughts on the build up to war: > Iraq has spent the past 30 years building up an arsenal of weapons of mass > destruction (WMD). Although the current threat presented by Iraq militarily > is modest, both in terms of conventional and unconventional weapons, it has > never given up its intent to develop and stockpile such weapons for both > military and terrorist use. He continued that \\"The long-term threat, however, remains Iraq's development to military maturity of weapons of mass destruction – something that only regime change will avert.\\" On 20 March 2003 British and American troops entered Iraq to bring about the regime change. Most of the country was occupied and the Saddam regime was overthrown within four weeks; Bush stated that war was over on 1 May 2003. On 7 May 2003 Kelly was telephoned by Susan Watts, the science editor of the BBC's Newsnight programme; the call lasted 15 to 20 minutes. They discussed various matters relating to Iraq including, towards the end of the conversation, the matter of the 45-minute claim. Watts's handwritten shorthand notes showed Kelly stated the claim was \\"a mistake to put in. Alastair Campbell seeing something in there, single source but not corroborated, sounded good.\\" The pair also had a subsequent call on 12 May. Kelly flew to Kuwait on 19 May as part of a military team. He hoped to meet members of the Iraq Survey Group to see how the organisation worked. When he arrived in Kuwait he found that no visa had been arranged for him, so he returned home. Contact with Andrew Gilligan On 22 May 2003 Kelly met Andrew Gilligan, the Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent for BBC Radio 4's Today programme, at the Charing Cross Hotel, London. It was the third time the pair had met. The meeting, initiated by Gilligan, was for the journalist to ask why Kelly thought WMDs had not been discovered in Iraq by the British and American troops. According to Gilligan, after 30 minutes the conversation focussed on the September Dossier and how key areas of the document were altered to give greater impact to the public. Gilligan took notes on an electric organiser; he said these read as > Transformed week before publication to make it sexier. The classic was the > 45 minutes. Most things in dossier were double source but that was single > source. One source said it took 4 [that should be 45] minutes to set up a > missile assembly, that was misinterpreted. Most people in intelligence > weren't happy with it because it didn't reflect the considered view they > were putting forward. Campbell: real information but unreliable, included > against our wishes. Not in original draft -- dull, he asked if anything else > could go in. Soon after the meeting, Gilligan claimed, he wrote a full script of the interview, based on his memory and notes. Between the completion of the document and the start of the Hutton Inquiry in August, Gilligan says he lost that script. Kelly was in New York on 29 May 2003, attending the final commissioners meeting of UNMOVIC under the leadership of Hans Blix. At 6.07 that morning, on the Today programme, Gilligan explained to the programme's host, John Humphrys, what he would be discussing later in the programme: > what we've been told by one of the senior officials in charge of drawing up > that dossier was that, actually the government probably erm, knew that that > forty five minute figure was wrong, even before it decided to put it in. > What this person says, is that a week before the publication date of the > dossier, it was actually rather erm, a bland production. It didn't, the, the > draft prepared for Mr Blair by the Intelligence Agencies actually didn't say > very much more than was public knowledge already and erm, Downing Street, > our source says, ordered a week before publication, ordered it to be sexed > up, to be made more exciting and ordered more facts to be er, to be > discovered. Gilligan had not been able to get confirmation from any other sources about the veracity of the claim. The producer of Today, Kevin Marsh, writes that Gilligan went off his pre-prepared script. With news based on an anonymous single source, the reports \\"have to be reported word perfectly\\" to be precise about the meaning; according to Marsh, \\"Gilligan had lost control of that precision\\". Downing Street had not been forewarned of the story, or been contacted to ask for a statement. At 7:32 am the government press office issued a statement to refute the story in the statement: \\"Not one word of the dossier was not entirely the work of the intelligence agencies\\". Gilligan then broadcast a report for the BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast programme in which he repeated the claim that the government had inserted the 45-minute claim into the dossier. Kelly did not recognise himself from Gilligan's description of a \\"senior official in charge of drawing up the document\\"; Kelly had taken no part in drafting the document and had only been asked for comments on the contents. The following day Watts telephoned Kelly at home to discuss the quotes on the Today programme; she recorded the call. When she asked him if he was being questioned about the identity of the source, Kelly replied \\"I mean they wouldn't think it was me, I don't think. Maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't. I don't know\\". Their conversation also included the possible involvement of Campbell in the inclusion of the 45-minute claim in the dossier: > SW OK just back momentarily on the 45 minute issue I'm feeling like I ought > to just explore that a little bit more with you the um err. So would it be > accurate then, as you did that earlier conversation, to say that it was > Alastair Campbell himself who... > DK No I can't. All I can say is the Number Ten press office. I've never met > Alastair Campbell so I can't ... But I think Alastair Campbell is synonymous > with that press office because he's responsible for it. Alastair Campbell, who, Gilligan asserted, had included the 45-minute claim in the 2002 September Dossier Despite the denial from the government, on 1 June—the day after Kelly and Watts had spoken on the telephone—Gilligan wrote an article for The Mail on Sunday in which he specifically named Campbell; it was titled: \\"I asked my intelligence source why Blair misled us all over Saddam's weapons. His reply? One word ... CAMPBELL\\". According to the journalist Miles Goslett, the report on the Today programme \\"caused little more than a ripple\\" of interest; the newspaper article \\"was of major international significance. It was career-threatening for all concerned if substantiated\\". As political tumult between Downing Street and the BBC developed, Kelly alerted his line manager at the MoD, Bryan Wells, that he had met Gilligan and discussed, among other points, the 45-minute claim. In a detailed letter of 30 June, Kelly stated that any mention of Campbell had been raised by Gilligan, not himself, and that this was an aside. Kelly stated that \\"I did not even consider that I was the 'source' of Gilligan's information\\"; he only became aware of the possibility after Gilligan had appeared at the Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 19 June. Kelly said of Gilligan's evidence that \\"The description of that meeting in small part matches my interaction with him especially my personal evaluation of Iraq's capability but the overall character is quite different\\". In closing, he reiterated that \\"With hindsight I of course deeply regret talking to Andrew Gilligan even though I am convinced that I am not his primary source of information.\\" Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, who chaired the meeting that agreed to confirm Kelly's name to journalists if they guessed his identity. Kelly was interviewed twice by his employers—on 3 and 7 July; they concluded that he may have been Gilligan's source, but that Gilligan may have exaggerated what Kelly said. A decision was taken that no official action was to be taken against Kelly. He was also advised that, with journalists pressing for further information, it was possible his name would emerge in press reports. Reports in The Times by the journalist Tom Baldwin on 5 and 8 July gave significant hints on the identity of Gilligan's source. At a meeting chaired by Blair on 8 July it was agreed that a statement should be released that stated a member of the MoD had come forward to say that he was the source. It was also agreed that Kelly's name would not be released to journalists, but if someone guessed who it was, they were allowed to confirm it. Kevin Tebbit, the permanent secretary at the MoD—Kelly's ultimate superior at the department—arrived at the end of the meeting and was unable to provide any input. At 5:54 pm on 8 July the government statement was released. Without naming Kelly, it said a member of the MoD had come forward to admit that he had met Gilligan at an unauthorised meeting a week before Gilligan's broadcast. The statement said that this MoD employee was not in a position to comment on Campbell's role in the 45 minute issue as he had not helped draw up the intelligence report and had not seen it. At 5:50 pm the following day a journalist from The Financial Times guessed Kelly's name correctly; a journalist from The Times did so soon afterwards after nineteen failed guesses. On the evening of 8 July Nick Rufford, a journalist with The Sunday Times who had known Kelly for five years, visited him at home in Southmoor. Rufford told him that his name would be published in the papers the following day. He advised Kelly to leave his home that night to avoid the media, and said the newspaper would put Kelly and his wife up at a hotel. Soon after Rufford left he contacted the MoD and asked if Kelly could write a piece for the paper putting forward his version of events; the MoD press office said this was unlikely. Soon afterwards the MoD phoned Kelly and advised him to find somewhere else to stay the night as the media would likely arrive at their house. According to Mrs Kelly, the couple left the house within 15 minutes and drove to Cornwall, breaking the journey overnight in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, where they arrived by 9:45 pm. Although the trip to Cornwall was described by Mrs Kelly at the Hutton Inquiry, Baker considers that there are \\"problems with the version of events we are asked to accept\\"; Goslett writes that Kelly played cribbage with a pub team in Kingston Bagpuize that night and was there until at least 10:30 pm. None of those on Kelly's cribbage team were asked to give evidence to the Hutton Inquiry. While in Cornwall, on the morning of 11 July, Kelly had a telephone call from Bryan Wells to tell him that he would have to appear in front of the Intelligence and Security and Foreign Affairs Select committees. He was told that the latter of these would be televised, something that upset him greatly, according to his wife. That afternoon, still unhappy with the news from the earlier phone call, he spoke to Wells again nine times. They agreed to meet on Monday 14 July to prepare for the interviews. Kelly returned from Cornwall on 13 July and stayed in Oxford at his daughter Rachel's house. Appearance before House of Commons committees David Chidgey, who put questions to Kelly that had been provided by Gilligan. The appearance of Kelly before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee was against the advice of Tebbit, the most senior civil servant at the MoD. He had been overruled by Geoff Hoon, the Secretary of State for Defence. Kelly appeared in front of the committee on 15 July in a session that lasted over an hour. He spoke so softly the fans in the room were turned off so the committee members could hear him reply; according to Baker, \\"Every word [from Kelly] was weighed carefully and some painful circumlocutions resulted\\". Kelly told the committee that he had met Gilligan but, as the journalist Tom Mangold, in Kelly's biography in the Dictionary of National Biography writes, \\"denied that he had said the things Gilligan reported his source as having said\\". Kelly was questioned by the Liberal Democrat MP David Chidgey about conversations with Susan Watts. It was the first time her name had been connected with Kelly in public, and it was later established that Gilligan had not only sent Chidgey excerpts from a recorded conversation, but also gave Chidgey questions to ask Kelly. The quote included Kelly's opinion on the 45 minute claim. Chidgey asked Kelly if the quotes came from the meeting he had with Watts in November 2002—the only time the pair had met face-to-face; Kelly replied that \\"I cannot believe that on that occasion I made that statement\\". According to Goslett, this was a truthful statement, as Kelly had not made the statement in November 2002, but on 30 May that year. Mangold notes that Kelly appeared to be under stress during the interview, and that some of the questioning was overtly hostile. One MP, Andrew MacKinlay, questioned Kelly towards the end of the session: > Andrew MacKinlay: I reckon you are chaff; you have been thrown up to divert > our probing. Have you ever felt like a fall-guy? You have been set up, have > you not? Dr Kelly: That is not a question I can answer. Andrew MacKinlay: > But you feel that? Dr Kelly: No, not at all. I accept the process that is > going on. After the hearing Kelly described MacKinlay to his daughter as an \\"utter bastard\\". On the following day, 16 July 2003, Kelly gave evidence to the Intelligence and Security Committee. He appeared more relaxed than he did in front of the Foreign Affairs Committee, according to Baker. When asked, Kelly described the September dossier as \\"an accurate document, I think it is a fair reflection of the intelligence that was available and it's presented in a very sober and factual way.\\" =Death: 17 July 2003= thumbupright=1.7Key points in the life of Dr David Kelly: 10px – Southmoor, where he lived 10px – Harrowdown Hill, where his body was found. Both locations are in Oxfordshire. On the morning of 17 July Kelly worked from his home in Southmoor, answering written parliamentary questions from two MPs—MacKinley on the identity of the journalists Kelly had spoken to, and the Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin on Kelly's discussions with Gilligan and whether he would be disciplined for it; Kelly had to provide the information to the MoD to forward on. He had a telephone call with Wing Commander John Clark, a friend and colleague during which they discussed the general situation Kelly was in, as well as a trip to Iraq on which Kelly was due to go in the following week. Clark reported that Kelly seemed to be \\"very tired, but in good spirits\\". He had received several emails from well-wishers, including from The New York Times journalist Judith Miller, to which he replied \\"I will wait until the end of the week before judging – many dark actors playing games. Thanks for your support.\\" During the course of the day Kelly received a phone call that changed his mood. Mangold states that \\"most likely explanation is that he learned from a well-meaning friend at the Ministry of Defence that the BBC had tape-recorded evidence which, when published, would show that he had indeed said the things to Susan Watts that he had formally denied saying\\". Mrs Kelly was ill that day and spent some time lying down in the couple's bedroom, but she got up at 3:00 pm to find Kelly speaking on the phone, before she returned to her bedroom to sleep. Goslett thinks this phone call is likely to have been with Clark, in a discussion about one of the answers to the parliamentary questions. Kelly left for a walk between 3:00 and 3:20 pm and was last seen by Ruth Absalom, a neighbour, with whom he stood to have a chat. She was the last person known to have seen him alive. Clark tried to contact Kelly at home—where Mrs Kelly told him that her husband had gone for a walk—and then on Kelly's mobile, which was switched off; Clark stated he was surprised it was off as Kelly was normally easily contactable. As far as it is known, Kelly walked a mile (1.6 km) from his house to Harrowdown Hill. It appears he ingested up to 29 tablets of co-proxamol, an analgesic drug, then cut his left wrist multiple times, severing his ulnar artery, with a pruning knife he had owned since his youth. It was subsequently established that neither the knife or the blister packs showed Kelly's fingerprints on their surfaces. Rachel Kelly spoke to her mother in the late afternoon, then drove round to her parents' house at around 6:00 pm. As her father had not returned, Rachel walked a route along a footpath her father was known to use regularly to try and find him; she returned to the house at around 6:30 pm, then drove round to see if she could find him. Sian, the Kellys' eldest daughter, also came to the house that night, and at 11:40 pm they phoned the police. Three officers from the local station in Abingdon arrived within 15 minutes; they searched the house and garden straight away. By 1:00 am a search helicopter, fitted with thermal imaging equipment, from RAF Benson, had been requested; teams of search dogs were also provided and a 26-metre (85 ft) communications mast was erected, as the Kellys' home was in a mobile communications black spot. Volunteer search teams were also used by the police, and it was one of these that found Kelly's body on Harrowdown Hill at about 9:20 am on 18 July. The two-person team differed in their description of the position of the body: one stated Kelly was \\"at the base of the tree with almost his head and his shoulders just slumped back against the tree\\"; the other stated Kelly was \\"sitting with his back up against a tree\\". The police and paramedics differed from both the searchers. DC Coe, one of the first policemen at the scene stated the body \\"was laying on its back – the body was laying on its back by a large tree, the head towards the trunk of the tree\\"; the pathologist called to the scene, Nicholas Hunt, recalled that: \\"his head was quite close to branches and so forth, but not actually over the tree.\\" Immediate aftermath St Mary's Church, Longworth, where Kelly was buried Blair was on an aeroplane from Washington to Tokyo when the body was found. He was contacted while en route and informed of the news, although Kelly had not been formally identified at that stage. He decided to order a judicial inquiry to examine the circumstances, which was to be headed by Lord Hutton, a former Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. His terms of reference were \\"urgently to conduct an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr Kelly\\". Hunt undertook the post-mortem examination on 19 July in the presence of eight police officers and two members of the coroner's office. Hunt concluded that the cause of death was a haemorrhage caused by a self-inflicted injury from \\"incised wounds to the left wrist\\", with the contributory factors of \\"co- proxamol ingestion and coronary artery atherosclerosis\\". On 20 July 2003, the day after the post-mortem, the BBC confirmed that Kelly was their only source. Nicholas Gardner, the coroner, opened and adjourned his inquest on 21 July, noting that the pathologist was still awaiting the toxicology report. With the establishment of the inquiry under Hutton, the Lord Chancellor's Department contacted Nicholas Gardner, the coroner, to advise him that under section 17A of the Coroners Act 1988, the coroner's inquest should only be resumed if there were exceptional circumstances to do so. On 6 August 2003, five days after the preliminary session of the Hutton Inquiry, Kelly was buried at St Mary's Church, Longworth. Hutton Inquiry Four witnesses from the Hutton Inquiry: (Clockwise from top left) Richard Dearlove, Greg Dyke, John Scarlett and Geoff Hoon From 11 August to 4 September 2003 witnesses to the inquiry were called in the order of the chronology of events. The second stage of the inquiry took place between 15 September and 25 September 2003; Hutton explained that he \\"would ask persons, who had already given evidence and whose conduct might possibly be the subject of criticism in my report, to come back to be examined further\\". There was one additional day used, 13 October 2003, to hear from one witness who had been ill on their scheduled day. As well as members of the Kelly family, evidence was taken from BBC employees (including Gilligan, Watts and Richard Sambrook, the BBC's Director of News) members of the government and its advisors (including Blair, Campbell, Hoon and McKinley) and civil servants, including John Scarlett, chairman of the JIC and Richard Dearlove, head of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). One of the witnesses who gave evidence to Hutton was David Broucher, the UK's permanent representative to the Conference on Disarmament. In 2002 or 2003 he had asked Kelly what would happen if Iraq were invaded; Kelly had replied \\"I will probably be found dead in the woods\\". Over the 24 days evidence was taken, the inquiry questioned 74 witnesses and received over 10,000 pages of evidence; most of the documents, along with transcripts of the questioning, were published online by the inquiry team. Hutton reported on 28 January 2004 and wrote: > I am satisfied that Dr Kelly took his own life by cutting his left wrist and > that his death was hastened by his taking Coproxamol tablets. I am further > satisfied that there was no involvement by a third person in Dr Kelly's > death. Hutton also concluded that the September dossier had not been \\"sexed up\\" by the government, or by Campbell, but was the work of the JIC. He cleared the government and its ministers of any wrongdoing and reserved his criticism for the BBC and Gilligan. According to George Jones, the political correspondent for The Daily Telegraph, Hutton's judgement on the BBC was \\"damning and shocked its journalists with its ferocity. He said the corporation had a \\"defective\\" editorial system that allowed Gilligan to make \\"unfounded\\" claims questioning the Government's integrity\\". Despite the conclusion of the Hutton report that Kelly committed suicide, there was continued debate over the manner of his death. Several doctors questioned the conclusion on medical grounds, although their position has been doubted by pathologists. The former leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, and the former Liberal Democrat MP, Norman Baker, both think Kelly was murdered. In 2007 Baker published The Strange Death of David Kelly in which he argued that Kelly did not commit suicide. Kelly's family expressed their displeasure at the publication; his sister-in-law said: \\"It is just raking over old bones. I can't speak for the whole family, but I've read it all [Baker's theories], every word, and I don't believe it.\\" Subsequent events In March 2004 the Oxfordshire coroner, Nicholas Gardiner, convened a hearing to decide whether there were the \\"exceptional circumstances\\" needed to resume the inquest; he concluded that such circumstances did not exist and that an inquest was not required. In 2007, information that no fingerprints were found on the knife that Dr Kelly supposedly used to kill himself was made public for the first time, thanks to a Freedom of Information request to Thames Valley Police (the same later turned out to be true about the blister packs of pills Dr Kelly supposedly ingested, and the water bottle he supposedly drank out of to help him swallow the pills). In December 2009 six doctors applied to the Oxford coroner's office to reopen the inquest, claiming that there was insufficient evidence for Hutton's conclusion of suicide. Their request was turned down on legal advice, and they were informed that evidence relating to Kelly's death was to be kept secret for 70 years. Hutton stated that he did so \\"solely in order to protect Dr Kelly's widow and daughters for the remainder of their lives (the daughters being in their twenties at that time) from the distress which they would suffer from further discussion of the details of Dr Kelly's death in the media\\". The Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, reviewed the case between 2010 and 2011. He spoke to both Hutton and Gardner before he concluded that there was no benefit in opening a new inquest into the matter; he stated that there was \\"overwhelmingly strong\\" evidence that Kelly committed suicide. Prior to Grieve's decision, the government released the post-mortem and toxicology reports that Hutton had said should be sealed for 70 years. Both documents supported the conclusion of the Hutton Inquiry. The pathologist wrote in the post-mortem: > It is my opinion that the main factor involved in bringing about the death > of David Kelly is the bleeding from the incised wounds to his left wrist. > Had this not occurred he may well not have died at this time. Furthermore, > on the balance of probabilities, it is likely that the ingestion of an > excess number of co-proxamol tablets coupled with apparently clinically > silent coronary artery disease would both have played a part in bringing > about death more certainly and more rapidly than would have otherwise been > the case. Therefore I give as the cause of death: :1a. Haemorrhage; :1b. > Incised wounds to the left wrist; :2. Co-proxamol ingestion and coronary > artery atherosclerosis. Kelly's grave was a focal point for the campaign group \\"Justice for Kelly\\", who left placards demanding an inquest and undertook vigils at the graveside. Following complaints by his widow and a request by her to the Diocese of Oxford, Kelly's remains were exhumed in June 2017. Legacy Kelly's death and the preceding events have served as an inspiration for artistic tributes and dramatisations including the song \\"Harrowdown Hill\\" by Thom Yorke; a 2008 painting, Death of David Kelly, by Dexter Dalwood; Jonathan Coe's 2015 novel Number 11; and a poem, \\"Hand-Washing Technique – Government Guidelines\\" (subtitled \\"i.m. Dr David Kelly\\"), by Simon Armitage. Kelly was the subject of a 2005 television drama, The Government Inspector, starring Mark Rylance, and \\"Justifying War: Scenes from the Hutton Inquiry\\" a radio play by the Tricycle Theatre. Kelly's last moments are featured in the centre monologue of the stage play Palace of the End by Judith Thompson. There have also been documentaries on British television and radio about Kelly. In the 1996 Birthday Honours Kelly was appointed as Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG); the citation reads: > He devised the scientific basis for the enhanced biological warfare defence > programme and led strong research groups in many key areas. Following the > Gulf War he led the first biological warfare inspection in Iraq and has > spent most of his time since either in Iraq or at various sites in the > former Soviet Union helping to shed light on past biological warfare related > activities and assisting the UK/US RUS trilateral confidence building > process. He has pursued this work tirelessly and with good humour despite > the significant hardship, hostility and personal risk encountered during > extended periods of service in both countries. ... His efforts in his > specialist field have had consequences of international significance. Lord Hutton, in the report to his inquiry, suggests that Kelly might well have been under consideration for a knighthood in May 2003. Kelly's work in Iraq earned him a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize; his biographer, the former MP Norman Baker, wrote of Kelly: > It is no exaggeration to say that between 1990 and his death in 2003, Dr > Kelly probably did more to make the world a more secure place than anyone on > the planet. Even among the elite group of international weapons inspectors, > he was regarded with some awe, as the inspectors' inspector.

Geologically, it connects the northern end of the Mid- Atlantic Ridge with the Laptev Sea Rift. The existence and approximate location of the Gakkel Ridge were predicted by Soviet polar explorer Yakov Yakovlevich Gakkel, and confirmed on Soviet expeditions in the Arctic around 1950.

The ridge is the slowest known spreading ridge on earth, with a rate of less than one centimeter per year. Until 1999, it was believed to be non-volcanic; that year, scientists operating from a nuclear submarine discovered active volcanoes along it. In 2001 two research icebreakers, the German Polarstern and the American Healy, with several groups of scientists, cruised to the Gakkel Ridge to explore it and collect petrological samples. Among other discoveries, this expedition found evidence of hydrothermal vents. In 2007, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution conducted the \\"Arctic Gakkel Vents Expedition\\" (AGAVE), which made some unanticipated discoveries, including the unconsolidated fragmented pyroclastic volcanic deposits that cover the axial valley of the ridge (whose area is greater than 10 km2). These suggest volatile substances in concentrations ten times those in the magmas of normal mid-ocean ridges.Robert A. Sohn, et al., \\"Explosive volcanism on the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel ridge, Arctic Ocean\\", Nature 453, 1236-1238 (26 June 2008)  http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7199/full/nature07075.html (abstract) Using \\"free-swimming\\" robotic submersibles on the Gakkel ridge, the AGAVE expedition also discovered what they called \\"bizarre 'mats' of microbial communities containing a half dozen or more new species\\".http://www.ridge2000.org/dls/abstracts.php \\"The Arctic Gakkel Vents (AGAVE) Expedition: A High–Stakes Technology Gamble Pays Big Dividends Beneath the Arctic Ice Cap\\", Ridge 2000 Abstracts 2009 The Gakkel ridge is remarkable in that is not offset by any transform faults. The ridge does have segments with variable orientation and varying degrees of volcanism: the Western Volcanic Zone From the Lena trough, 7° W, to 3° E longitude), the Sparsely Magmatic Zone (from 3° E to 29° E longitude), and the Eastern Magmatic Zone (from 29° E to 89°E).Peter J. Michael, et al., \\"Magmatic and amagmatic seafloor generation at the ultraslow-spreading Gakkel ridge, Arctic Ocean\\", Nature 423, 956–961, (26 June 2003)  The gaps of volcanic activity imply very cold crust and mantle, probably related to the very low spreading rate, but it is not yet known why some parts of the ridge are more magmatic than others.Laurent Montesi and Mark D. Behn, \\"Mantle flow and melting underneath oblique and ultraslow mid‐ocean ridges\\", Geophysical Research Letters 34, L24307, ( 25 December 2007)  Some earthquakes have been detected from the mantle, below the crust, which is very unusual for a mid-ocean ridge.Vera Schlindwein, et al., \\"Seismicity of the Arctic mid-ocean Ridge system\\", Polar Science 9, 146-157, (March 2015)  It confirms that the mantle and crust of Gakkel ridge, like some segments of the Southwest Indian Ridge, are very cold.

Modern circus, as an integrated entertainment experience that includes music, domesticated animals, acrobats, and clowns, traces its heritage to Astley's Amphitheatre, a riding school that Astley founded in London following the success of trick-riding displays given by him and his wife Patty Jones in 1768.Schechter, Joel (2001). The Pickle Clowns: New American Circus Comedy. p. 11\\\\. Southern Illinois University Press. Astley's first competitor was equestrian Charles Hughes, who had previously worked with Astley. Together with Charles Dibdin, a famous author of pantomimes, Hughes opened a rival amphitheatre in London, which Dibdin called the Royal Circus and Equestrian Philharmonic Academy. Astley and his wife put on the first circus show on Easter Monday, 4 April 1768. Extending the equestrian performance with exhibitions of warlike sabre-work and sword-play. The initial performances were done in the open air at Ha'penny (= Halfpenny) Hatch, a field in Lambeth, London, near the present site of Waterloo railway station. The Astleys also performed at other locations in London. Astley performed his stunts in a circular arena, though Astley never used the title of 'circus' for his shows. Astley's 'Ride' (he also called it 'the Circle') was a ring 65 ft (19 metres) in diameter. Later, the size evolved to become standardised at 42 feet (13 metres) which is the size used by circuses ever since. Leasing more permanent premises at Westminster Bridge from 1769, he improved conditions for audiences with a covered stands. The performances themselves, however, were still performed in the open. In 1770 he hired acrobats, tightrope walkers, jugglers and a clown to fill in the pauses between acts. and so initiated the format which we now know as a 'circus' and which has since spread to many countries. Biography Philip Astley was born in Newcastle-under-Lyme in England the son of a cabinetmaker.The book of days: A miscellany of popular antiquities in connection with the calendar, including anecdote, biography, & history, curiosities of literature and oddities of human life and character. p. 474\\\\. Robert Chambers, ed. 1864. At the age of nine, he apprenticed with his father, but Astley's dream was to work with horses, so he joined Colonel Eliott's Fifteenth Light Dragoons when he was 17, later becoming a Sergeant Major. His service in the Seven Years' War brought him into contact with professional trainers and riders. Astley himself was a brilliant rider. =Equestrian master= Astley had a genius for trick riding. He saw that trick riders received the most attention from the crowds in Islington. He had an idea for opening a riding school in London in which he could also conduct shows of acrobatic riding skill. In 1768, Astley performed in an open field in what is now the Waterloo area of London, behind the present site of St John's Church.The first circus Victoria and Albert Museum. Astley added a clown to his shows to amuse the spectators between equestrian sequences, moving to fenced premises just south of Westminster Bridge, where he opened his riding school from 1769 onwards and expanded the content of his shows (see below).The Memoirs of Jacob Decastro, Comedian London, 1824 He taught riding in the mornings and performed his \\"feats of horsemanship\\" in the afternoons. Astley began to make a reputation and to grow wealthier. After two seasons in London he had to bring some novelty to his performances, so he hired other equestrians, musicians, a clown, jugglers, tumblers, tightrope walkers, and dancing dogs – the modern circus was created.Samuel McKechnie, Popular Entertainments through the Ages. London; Sampson Low, Marston & Co Ltd., 1931; Explore PA history.com - Historical Markers Guilds and lineages of acrobats and clowns had performed throughout Europe for centuries before this, but as members of independent professions, not as part of an integrated entertainment experience for which an all-inclusive ticket was sold. Astley did not invent trick-riding, which was already a popular entertainment of the period. Nor did he originate the idea of performing in a circular 'ring'. The use of the circular arena is successful for two reasons. First, it is easier for the audience to keep the riders in sight. Second, the circular ring (though Astley called it 'the Ride') helps riders through the generation of centrifugal force, which assists them in keeping their balance while standing on the backs of their galloping horses. Astley never called his 'Astley's Amphitheatre of Equestrian Arts' a circus; that title was thought up by Charles Dibdin, who in partnership with Astley's rival Charles Hughes, opened the Royal Circus on 4 November 1782, a short distance from Astley's in Lambeth, London.Joe Nickell (2005). Secrets of the Sideshows. p. 8\\\\. University Press of Kentucky, 2005.Loxton, Howard (1997). The Golden Age of the Circus. p. 14\\\\. Smithmark, 1997. After a few years, Astley added a platform, seats, and a roof to his ring. Even after his death Astley's \\"Royal Amphitheatre\\" remained famous throughout the nineteenth century, being mentioned by Charles Dickens and Jane Austen. It was closed in 1893 and was demolished the next year. The garden of St Thomas's Hospital now occupies the site; a commemorative paving stone (see below) marks the Amphitheatre's former position. Astley's original circus ring was 65 ft (~19 m) in diameter, and later he settled it at 42 ft (~13 m), which has been an international standard for circuses since.\\"The circus comes to the Circus\\". BBC News. Retrieved 13 December 2014 Not far from the Amphitheatre site is Hercules Road, named after the house Astley built and named Hercules Hall.

Leathers (1959). \\"British entertainers in France\\" p. 29\\\\. University of Toronto Press, 1959 Astley then established 18 other permanent circuses in cities throughout Europe. During the summers and at other times when his London establishment was inactive, Astley began to establish wooden amphitheatres abroad; the first of these was erected in 1773 in Dublin, Ireland. He later established eighteen other circuses in European cities, was patronised by a great number of royals, and was famous, envied, and occasionally rich. He never used wild animals in the circus arena. In 1806, with the profits he had earned from his amphitheatre, Astley opened a new venue, the Olympic Pavilion (also known as the Olympic Theatre) on Wych Street, Westminster, near the Strand. This tent- like structure, partly built from the remains of a French warship, did not prove a success, and in 1813 he sold it to Robert William Elliston, who renamed it the Little Drury Lane. Astley died a year later in Paris and was buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery, the cause of his death being gout in the stomach.The Book of Days =Legacy= Astley's Amphitheatre in London circa 1808.

Astley's circus is featured prominently in Tracy Chevalier's novel Burning Bright. 31 May 1982 saw illusionist Fred Van Buren stage the first celebration of Philip Astley in the form of Newcastle-under-Lyme's annual carnival, which had the theme of Philip Astley's Circus. This event began the journey to bring Astley back into the public's awareness. Then in 1992 the British magician illusionist Andrew Van Buren commissioned a life-size statue to be made of Philip Astley to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Astley's birth.The Philip Astley Project news Van Buren is the Astley expert and curator of the Philip Astley Project, creating and uniting archives, exhibitions and a series of events to celebrate the 250th anniversary of circus in 2018 and beyond. Circus 250 The Circus250 celebrations began in January 2018 when Andrew Van Buren joined Albert II, Prince of Monaco and Princess Stéphanie of Monaco for the unveiling of a plaque to Philip Astley in Monte Carlo. Following this in February 2018 the United Kingdom's first permanent monument to Philip Astley and his legacy of the circus was positioned on the Stoke-on-Trent / Newcastle-under-Lyme border. The monument was designed by Candida Kelsall, built by PM Training and funded by the Realise Foundation. This was then unveiled on World Circus Day 2018 by Federation Mondiale du Cirque Director Zsuzsanna Mata, the Newcastle-under- Lyme Mayor Simon White and Van Buren. A second of these monuments was then positioned in the village of Silverdale, which is the opposite side of Newcastle-under-Lyme.

Padilla was arrested in Chicago on May 8, 2002, on suspicion of plotting a radiological bomb (\\"dirty bomb\\") attack. He was detained as a material witness until June 9, 2002, when President George W. Bush designated him an enemy combatant and, arguing that he was not entitled to trial in civilian courts, had him transferred to a military prison in South Carolina. Padilla was held for three and a half years as an enemy combatant. Upon pressure and lawsuits from civil liberties groups, he was transferred to a civilian jail in 2006. In August 2007, a federal jury found him guilty of conspiring to commit murder and fund terrorism. Government officials had earlier claimed Padilla was suspected of planning to build and explode a \\"dirty bomb\\" in the United States, but he was never charged with this crime. He was initially sentenced to 17 years in prison, which was increased on appeal to 21 years. His lawsuits against the military for allegedly torturing him were rejected by the courts for lack of merit and jurisdictional issues. Early life Jose Padilla was born in Brooklyn, New York to Estella Obregón and her husband, both of Puerto Rican descent. The family later moved to Chicago, Illinois. As a youth, Padilla joined the Latin Kings street gang and was arrested several times. During his gang years, he maintained several aliases, such as José Rivera, José Alicea, José Hernandez, and José Ortiz. As a 14-year-old juvenile, he was convicted of aggravated assault and manslaughter after a gang member, whom he had kicked in the head, died. After serving his last jail sentence, Padilla converted to Islam.[\\"'Dirty Bomb' Suspect's Criminal Record\\", cnn.com, June 11, 2002. One of his early religious instructors was an Islamic teacher who professed a nonviolent philosophy and Padilla appeared at the time to be faithful to his mentor's teachings.Sontag, Deborah. \\"Terror Suspect's Path From Streets To Brig\\", New York Times, April 25, 2004. While living in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Padilla attended the Masjid Al-Iman mosque, as did Adham Amin Hassoun, \\"for most of the 1990s and [they] were reportedly friends.\\" U.S. authorities accused Hassoun of associating with radical Islamic fundamentalists, including Al-Qaeda. Hassoun, a Lebanese-born Palestinian, was arrested in 2002 for overstaying his visa and was charged in 2004 with providing material support to terrorists.\\"Two Defendants Charged in Florida with Providing Material Support to Terrorists\\", United States Department of Justice; accessed May 14, 2018. By that time, Hassoun had already been charged with perjury, a weapons offense, and other offenses. Marriage and family Broward County, Florida court records show that on July 1, 1994, Padilla changed his name to one word: \\"Ibrahim\\". He was married under that name to Cherie Maria Stultz on January 2, 1996. They divorced in March 2001, according to court records. In January 2001, she had placed an ad in a local business newspaper, serving notice that she was seeking divorce. Their divorce papers identify him as Jose Ibrahim Padilla. Padilla married an Egyptian woman named Shamia'a, and they had two sons together. When he was arrested in 2002, the boys were infants. At his bail hearing, his wife and children were believed to be overseas.\\"Judge Refuses To Set Bail For Padilla\\", Fox News, February 17, 2006.Goodnough, Abby. \\"Prosecutors Are Wrapping Up Case Against Padilla; Arresting Agents Testify\\", New York Times, July 13, 2007. Terroristic activity According to press reports in 2002, Padilla had been in the Afghanistan–Pakistan region in 2001 and early 2002. At the time, the Defense Department said that Abu Zubaydah, then believed to be a top al-Qaeda official, had led the US to Padilla. Padilla was alleged to have been trained in the construction and employment of radiologic weapons – \\"dirty bombs\\" – at an al-Qaeda safe house in Lahore, Pakistan. Padilla and Binyam Mohammed, a United Kingdom resident, were alleged to have been recruited at the Lahore safe house to travel to the United States to launch terrorist attacks. However, more recent evidence suggests that the \\"dirty bomb\\" plot was likely a ruse to get out of Pakistan and based on an internet joke website purporting to describe how to build an H-bomb by swinging buckets of uranium as fast as possible. A 2003 CIA memo notes that the satirical article \\"is filled with countless technical inaccuracies which would likely result in the death of anyone attempting to follow the instructions, and definitely would not result in a nuclear explosion\\". Arrest Padilla traveled to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. On his return, he was arrested by U.S. Customs agents at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on May 8, 2002, and held as a material witness on a warrant issued in the state of New York stemming from the September 11, 2001, attacks. On June 9, 2002, two days before District Court Judge Michael Mukasey was to issue a ruling on the validity of continuing to hold Padilla under the material witness warrant, President George Bush issued an order to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to detain Padilla as an \\"enemy combatant.\\" Padilla was transferred to a military brig in Charleston, South Carolina, without any notice to his attorney or family. The order \\"legally justified\\" the detention using the 2001 AUMF passed in the wake of September 11, 2001, (formally \\"The Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution\\" (Public Law 107-40)) and opined that a U.S. citizen detained on U.S. soil can be classified as an enemy combatant. (This opinion is based on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in the case of Ex parte Quirin, a case involving the detention of eight German spies operating in the United States while working for Nazi Germany during World War II.)\\"Authorization for Use of Military Force: Padilla v. Bush:, Jose Padilla under the Joint Resolution\\" , The Syracuse Journal of International Law and Commerce, Syracuse University College of Law. According to the text of the ensuing decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Padilla's detention as an \\"enemy combatant\\" (pursuant to the President's order) was based on the following reasons: # Padilla was \\"closely associated with al Qaeda,\\" a designation for loosely knit insurgent groups sharing common ideals and tactics, \\"with which the United States is at war\\"; # he had engaged in \\"war-like acts, including conduct in preparation for acts of international terrorism\\"; # he had intelligence that could assist the United States in warding off future terrorist attacks; and # he was a continuing threat to American security. 2002 memos Shortly after September 26, 2002, the top political appointees David Addington, Alberto Gonzales, John A. Rizzo, William Haynes II, two Justice Department lawyers, Alice S. Fisher and Patrick F. Philbin, and then-Special Counsel to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense Jack Goldsmith flew to Camp Delta to view Mohammed al-Kahtani, then to Charleston, South Carolina, to view Padilla, and finally to Norfolk, Virginia, to view Yaser Esam Hamdi, who had been subjected to coercive techniques including solitary confinement.Mayer, Jane, \\"The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals,\\" 2008. p. 199 It was later learned that top administration officials had earlier discussed and approved the use of enhanced interrogation techniques for the CIA. They were consulting with DOD agents to discuss techniques that might be used against the detainees in military custody. Later that year, additional \\"harsh techniques\\" were used on these three and other prisoners. In October 2008, 91 pages of memos drafted in 2002 by officers at the Naval Consolidated Brig, Charleston were made public. The memos indicate that officers were concerned that the isolation of solitary confinement and lack of stimuli were causing the prisoner Yasser Hamdi mental anguish and threatened his sanity. The memos also state that Padilla and a third prisoner, Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, were held in similar conditions at the Brig. Habeas corpus Because Padilla was being detained without any criminal charges being formally made against him, he, through his lawyer, made a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as the respondent to this petition. The government filed a motion to dismiss the petition on the grounds that: # Padilla's lawyer was not a proper \\"next Friend\\" to sign and file the petition on Padilla's behalf. # Commander Marr of the South Carolina brig, and not U.S. Secretary Rumsfeld, should have been named as the respondent to the petition. # The New York court lacked personal jurisdiction over the named respondent Secretary Rumsfeld who resides in Virginia. The New York District Court disagreed with the government's arguments and denied its motion. However, the court declared that President Bush had constitutional and statutory authority to designate and detain American citizens as \\"enemy combatants.\\" It held that Padilla had the right to challenge his \\"enemy combatant\\" designation and detention in the course of his habeas corpus petition, although immediate release was denied. Both Padilla and the government made an interlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On December 18, 2003, the Second Circuit declared that # Padilla's lawyer is a proper \\"next friend\\" to sign and file the habeas corpus petition on Padilla's behalf because she, as a member of the bar, had a professional duty to defend her client's interests. Further, she had a significant attorney-client relationship with Padilla and was far from being some zealous \\"intruder\\" or \\"uninvited meddler,\\" as described by the government. # Secretary Rumsfeld can be named as the respondent to Padilla's habeas corpus petition, although South Carolina's Navy Commander Marr had immediate physical custody of Padilla, because there have been past cases where national-level officials have been named as respondents to such petitions. # The New York District Court had personal jurisdiction over Secretary Rumsfeld although Rumsfeld resided in Virginia and not New York because New York's \\"long-arm statute\\" is applicable to Secretary Rumsfeld, who was responsible for Padilla's physical transfer from New York to South Carolina. # Despite the legal precedent set by ex parte Quirin, \\"the president lacked inherent constitutional authority as commander in chief to detain American citizens on American soil outside a zone of combat.\\" The Second Circuit relied on the case of Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), where the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that President Truman, during the Korean War years, could not use his position and power as commander in chief, created under Article 2, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution, to seize the nation's steel mills on the eve of a nationwide steelworkers strike. The extraordinary government power to curb civil rights and liberties during crisis periods, such as times of war, lies with Congress and not the president. Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2, of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress, and not the president, the power to suspend the right of habeas corpus during a period of rebellion or invasion. Declaring that without clear congressional approval (per ), President Bush cannot detain an American citizen arrested in the United States and away from a zone of combat as an \\"illegal enemy combatant\\", the court ordered that Padilla be released from the military brig within 30 days. However, the court stayed the release order pending the government's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. =U.S. Supreme Court= On February 20, 2004, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the government's appeal. The Supreme Court heard the case, Rumsfeld v. Padilla, in April 2004, but on June 28, 2004, the court dismissed the petition on technical grounds because # It was improperly filed in federal court in New York instead of South Carolina, where Padilla was being detained. # The Court held that the petition was incorrect in naming the secretary of defense as the respondent for habeas corpus purposes instead of the commanding officer of the naval brig who was Padilla's direct custodian. =District Court for South Carolina= sensory-deprived trip to the dentist; published by the New York Times in December 2006. The case was re-filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, and on February 28, 2005, the court ordered that the government either charge or release Padilla. On June 13, 2005, the Supreme Court denied the government's petition to have his case heard directly by the court, instead of the appeal being first heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia. On September 9, 2005, a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit ruled that President Bush had the authority to detain Padilla without charges. An opinion written by judge J. Michael Luttig cited the joint resolution by Congress authorizing military action following the September 11, 2001, attacks, as well as the June 2004 ruling concerning Yaser Hamdi. Attorneys for Padilla and civil liberties organizations, filing amicus curiae briefs, argued that the detention was illegal. They said it could lead to the military holding anyone, from protesters to people who check out what the government considers the wrong books from the library. The Bush administration denied the allegations. The defense argument noted that the congressional military authorization (the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists) pertained only to nations, organizations, or persons whom the president \\"determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the September 11, 2001, attacks, or harbored such organizations or persons.\\" They advanced a reading of this language would suggest a Congressional limitation to the military power would assure an appropriately narrow range of detainees and that the power to detain would last only so long as the Congressional authorization was not revoked or remained in effect by its terms. Similarly, they noted that the Yaser Hamdi Supreme Court case (Hamdi v. Rumsfeld) upon which the court relied, required a habeas corpus hearing for any alleged enemy combatant who demands one, claiming not to be such a combatant, which would require additional judicial or military tribunal oversight over each such detention. The argument in the general public concerning the legality of Padilla's detention examined one of the provisions of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 enacted on October 17, 2006, which states: Indictment On November 22, 2005, CNN reported that Padilla had been indicted in federal court on charges he \\"conspired to murder, kidnap, and maim people overseas.\\" Padilla's lawyer correlated the indictment's timing as avoidance of an impending Supreme Court hearing on the Padilla case: \\"The administration is seeking to avoid a Supreme Court showdown over the issue.\\" None of the original allegations made by the U.S. government three years prior, which had contributed to Padilla's being held the majority of the time in solitary confinement, was part of the indictment, nor was there any charge related to incidents within the United States. Democracy Now! further asserted: > Attorney General Alberto Gonzales announced Padilla is being removed from > military custody and charged with a series of crimes\\" and \\"There is no > mention in the indictment of Padilla's alleged plot to use a dirty bomb in > the United States. There is also no mention that Padilla ever planned to > stage any attacks inside the country. And there is no direct mention of Al- > Qaeda. Instead the indictment lays out a case involving five men who helped > raise money and recruit volunteers in the 1990s to go overseas to countries > including Chechnya, Bosnia, Somalia and Kosovo. Padilla, in fact, appears to > play a minor role in the conspiracy. He is accused of going to a jihad > training camp in Afghanistan but his lawyers said the indictment offers no > evidence he ever engaged in terrorist activity. Padilla was held for years in military custody with no formal charges. Critics said such a process would allow the U.S. government to detain citizens indefinitely without presenting the case that would eventually be tried. On December 21, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit refused to authorize a transfer from the Navy brig to civil court. The court suggested that the administration was manipulating the federal court system with \\"intentional mooting\\" in order to avoid Supreme Court review. It said that the \\"shifting tactics in the case threatens [the government's] credibility with the courts.\\" The Solicitor General Paul Clement said that the federal appeals court decision \\"defies both law and logic.\\" He asked the Supreme Court authorize immediate transfer on December 30, 2005. This took place one day after Padilla's lawyers filed a petition charging the president with overstepping his authority. On January 3, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a Bush administration request to transfer Padilla from military to civilian custody. He was transferred to a federal prison in Miami while the Supreme Court decided whether to accept his appeal of the government's authority to keep US citizens it designates \\"enemy combatants\\" in open-ended military confinement without benefit of trial. On April 3, 2006, the Supreme Court declined, with three justices dissenting from denial of certiorari, to hear Padilla's appeal from the 4th Circuit Court's decision. It left the 4th Circuit court's ruling that the president had the power to designate and detain him as an \\"enemy combatant\\" without charges and with disregard to habeas corpus. Criminal proceedings \\"Supermax\\", where Padilla is held in Florence, Colorado Padilla was indicted on three criminal counts in the Miami, Florida, criminal proceeding. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. The trial commenced on May 15, 2007, and lasted for 3 months. =Partial dismissal of counts against Padilla= Two weeks after the presiding judge claimed prosecutors were \\"light on facts\\" in their conspiracy allegations, the government dismissed one of its three charges against Padilla and dismissed another in part. The count of conspiracy to murder (punishable by life imprisonment) was dismissed on August 16, 2006, on the grounds that it was duplicative of the other two counts pending against him. The second count was conspiracy to materially aid terrorists under (punishable by five years in prison) and the third was (punishable by 15 years in prison). The trial court ordered that the government elect a single criminal statute in its second count of the indictment. However, on January 30, 2007, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit reversed the ruling and reinstated a charge of conspiracy to \\"murder, kidnap, and maim.\\" =Delays in prosecution= Two additional motions filed in October 2006 argued that the case should be dismissed because the government took too much time between arresting Padilla and charging him, violating Padilla's constitutional right to a speedy trial as the arrest took place prior to his detention as an enemy combatant and not when he was transferred to civilian custody. =Mental competency hearing= In January 2007, a mental competency hearing was scheduled for Padilla for February 22, 2007. Two mental health experts hired by the defense to conduct a competency evaluation concluded Padilla was not mentally fit for trial; a third evaluation submitted by the Bureau of Prisons found him mentally competent. The judge ordered that Sandy Seymour, technical director of the Charleston brig; Craig Noble, brig psychologist; Andrew Cruz, brig social worker; four employees of the Miami federal detention center; and a Defense Department lawyer appear at the hearing. On February 22, 2007, at the competency hearing, Dr. Angela Hegarty, a psychiatrist hired by Padilla's defense, said that after 22 hours of examining Padilla, she believed that he was mentally unfit to stand trial. She said he exhibited \\"a facial tic, problems with social contact, lack of concentration and a form of Stockholm syndrome.\\" She diagnosed his condition as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and told the court, \\"It's my opinion that he lacks the capacity to assist counsel. He has a great deal of difficulty talking about the current case before him.\\" In cross examination, federal prosecutor John Shipley noted that Padilla had a score of zero on Hegarty's post-traumatic stress disorder test and pointed out that this information was omitted in her final report. Hegarty stated that the omission was an error on her part. Another psychiatrist hired by the defense testified along the same lines. The Miami Herald reported that a \\"U.S. Bureau of Prisons psychiatrist who believes Padilla is fit to face trial and Defense Department officials—are expected to testify at the ongoing hearing before U.S. District Judge Marcia Cooke.\\" =Conviction and sentencing= On August 16, 2007, after a day and a half of deliberations, the jury found Padilla guilty on all counts. He was scheduled to be sentenced on December 5, 2007, but his sentencing was postponed to January due to the death of a family member of the judge scheduled to sentence him. He was sentenced on January 22, 2008, to 17 years and 4 months in federal prison.\\"Padilla sentenced on terror charges\\", NBC News; accessed May 14, 2013.

The Wall Street Journal said in an editorial, \\"the lawyers suing for Padilla aren't interested in justice. They're practicing 'lawfare', which is an effort to undermine the war on terror by making U.S. officials afraid to pursue it for fear of personal liability.\\" In January 2012, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and his case has been ruled on numerous times.\\"'Lawfare' Loses Big\\", Wall Street Journal; accessed May 14, 2018. =Sentence ruled too lenient= On September 19, 2011, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the 17-year prison sentence imposed on Padilla, ruling that the sentence was too lenient. They sent the case back to the lower court for a new sentencing hearing.

In it, he asks questions such as whether the president can lock up any person in the world and then deny that person access to family, defense counsel, and civilian court review; and objects to the use of \\"harsh conditions\\" and \\"environmental stresses\\". He questioned whether such techniques can be employed against anyone once the president gives an order. Those legal questions remain unsettled. Lynch argued that, by abruptly moving Padilla from the military brig and transferring him into the civil criminal justice system, the Bush administration was able to forestall Supreme Court review of the president's military powers.\\"Brief of the Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae in Support of Respondents\\", cato.org; accessed May 14, 2018. *Glenn Greenwald, journalist and former constitutional law and civil rights litigator, wrote a highly critical piece in the online magazine Salon.com in September 2011: > The treatment Padilla has received in the justice system is, needless to > say, the polar opposite of that enjoyed by these political elites ... > Literally days before it was required to justify to the U.S. Supreme Court > how it could imprison an American citizen for years without charges or > access to a lawyer, the Bush administration suddenly indicted Padilla -- on > charges unrelated to, and far less serious than, the accusation that he was > A Dirty Bomber -- and then successfully convinced the Supreme Court to > refuse to decide the legality of Padilla's imprisonment on the grounds of > 'mootness'. *A 2012 editorial in the Wall Street Journal describes efforts of the ACLU and others on Padilla's behalf as \\"lawfare\\". It said that the court ruling throwing out a lawsuit filed for Padilla as a \\"victory for legal sanity.\\" Civil proceedings On January 4, 2008, Padilla and his mother filed suit against John Yoo in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (Case Number CV08 0035). The complaint sought damages based on the alleged torture of Padilla, and attributed this treatment as having been authorized by Yoo's legal opinions issued in August 2002, known as the \\"Torture memos\\". The suit posited that Yoo caused Padilla's damages by authorizing Padilla's alleged torture through his memoranda. On June 28, 2009, the trial court held that the complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim, because if everything stated in the complaint was taken as true, it stated grounds for Yoo to be liable to Padilla for civil damages.Order Denying In Part and Granting In Part Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, lawprofessors.typepad.com; accessed May 14, 2018. But on February 17, 2011, the District Court dismissed another suit by Padilla against other former officials which had been brought on February 9, 2007. Lebron v. Rumsfeld, 764 F.Supp.2d 787 (D.S.C.). On January 23, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed this dismissal.Lebron v. Rumsfeld, uscourts.gov; accessed May 14, 2018. In May 2012, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Yoo could not be held accountable for Padilla's treatment because, though his treatment might have amounted to torture, it was not defined as such legally in 2002–2003 when it occurred.Rosenthal, Andrew, \\"Tortured Logic\\", The New York Times, May 3, 2012.

Consumer theory uses the concepts of a budget constraint and a preference map to analyze consumer choices. Both concepts have a ready graphical representation in the two-good case.  Uses  = Individual choice = An individual should consume at (Qx, Qy). Consumer behaviour is a maximization problem. It means making the most of our limited resources to maximize our utility. As consumers are insatiable, and utility functions grow with quantity, the only thing that limits our consumption is our own budget. In general, the budget set (all bundle choices that are on or below the budget line) represents all possible bundles of goods an individual can afford given their income and the prices of goods. When behaving rationally, an individual consumer should choose to consume goods at the point where the most preferred available indifference curve on their preference map is tangent to their budget constraint. The tangent point (the xy coordinate) represents the amount of goods x and y the consumer should purchase to fully utilize their budget to obtain maximum utility.Lipsey (1975). p 182. It is important to note that the optimal consumption bundle will not always be an interior solution. If the solution to the optimality condition leads to a bundle that is not feasible, the consumer's optimal bundle will be a corner solution which suggests the goods or inputs are perfect substitutes. A line connecting all points of tangency between the indifference curve and the budget constraint is called the expansion path.Salvatore, Dominick (1989). Schaum's outline of theory and problems of managerial economics, McGraw-Hill, All two dimensional budget constraints are generalized into the equation: P_x x+P_y y=m Where: * m= money income allocated to consumption (after saving and borrowing) * P_x= the price of a specific good * P_y= the price of all other goods * x= amount purchased of a specific good * y= amount purchased of all other goods The equation can be rearranged to represent the shape of the curve on a graph: y= (m/P_y)-(P_x/P_y) x, where (m/P_y) is the y-intercept and (-P_x/P_y) is the slope, representing a downward sloping budget line. The factors that can shift the budget line are a change in income (m), a change in the price of a specific good (P_x), or a change in the price of all other goods (P_y). = International economics = Point X is unobtainable given the current \\"budget\\" constraints on production. A production-possibility frontier is a constraint in some ways analogous to a budget constraint, showing limitations on a country's production of multiple goods based on the limitation of available factors of production. Under autarky this is also the limitation of consumption by individuals in the country. However, the benefits of international trade are generally demonstrated through allowance of a shift in the consumption-possibility frontiers of each trade partner which allows access to a more appealing indifference curve. In the \\"toolbox\\" Hecksher-Ohlin and Krugman models of international trade, the budget constraint of the economy (its CPF) is determined by the terms-of-trade (TOT) as a downward- sloped line with slope equal to those TOTs of the economy. (The TOTs are given by the price ratio Px/Py, where x is the exportable commodity and y is the importable).  Many goods  While low-level demonstrations of budget constraints are often limited to less than two good situations which provide easy graphical representation, it is possible to demonstrate the relationship between multiple goods through a budget constraint. In such a case, assuming there are n\\\\, goods, called x_i\\\\, for i=1,\\\\dots,n\\\\,, that the price of good x_i\\\\, is denoted by p_i\\\\,, and if \\\\,W\\\\, is the total amount that may be spent, then the budget constraint is: :\\\\sum_{i=1}^np_ix_i\\\\leq W. Further, if the consumer spends his income entirely, the budget constraint binds: :\\\\sum_{i=1}^np_ix_i=W. In this case, the consumer cannot obtain an additional unit of good x_i\\\\, without giving up some other good. For example, he could purchase an additional unit of good x_i\\\\, by giving up p_i/p_j\\\\, units of good x_j.\\\\,  See also  *Choice modelling *Contingent valuation *Guns versus butter model *Heckscher–Ohlin theorem on country level budget constraints called resource endowments *Intertemporal budget constraint *Opportunity cost *Scarcity *Trade-off  Notes   References  * Category:Consumer theory Constraint Category:Economics curves ","title":"Budget constraint"},{"id":"271315","text":"The game port, originally introduced on the Game Control Adapter, is a device port that was found on IBM PC compatible and other computer systems throughout the 1980s and 1990s. It was the traditional connector for joystick input, and occasionally MIDI devices, until phased out by USB in the late 1990s. Originally located on a dedicated expansion card, the game port was later integrated with PC sound cards, and still later on the PC's motherboard. During the transition to USB, many input devices used the game port and a USB adaptor dongle was included for systems without a game port. History This Microsoft joystick's output was the traditional game port, but was supplied with a game-port-to-USB adaptor for connection to newer systems. A \\"Y-splitter\\" cable used to connect multiple devices to the same game port The game port first appeared during the initial launch of the original IBM PC in 1981, in the form of an optional US$55 expansion card known as the Game Control Adapter. The design allowed for four analog axes and four buttons on one port, allowing two joysticks or four paddles to be connected via a special \\"Y-splitter\\" cable. At the time there was no industry standard for controller ports, although the closest was the Atari joystick port. This was originally introduced in 1977 on the Atari 2600, and by 1981, was used on both Atari gear and the Commodore VIC-20. But it could not be considered truly widespread until around 1983, when it appeared on the Commodore 64 and several other platforms. In contrast with the IBM design, the Atari port was primarily designed for digital inputs; its only analog connections were intended for paddles. The Apple II, BBC Micro, Tandy Color Computer, and other popular 8-bit machines all used different, incompatible, joysticks and ports. In most respects, the IBM design was similar or more advanced than existing designs. Originally available only as add-on that took up an entire slot, game ports remained relatively rare in the early days of the IBM PC, and most games used the keyboard as an input. IBM did not release a joystick of its own for the PC, which did not help. The most common device available was the Kraft joystick, originally developed for the Apple II but easily adapted to the IBM with the addition of another button on the back of the case. When IBM finally did release a joystick, for the IBM PCjr, it was a version of the Kraft stick. However, it connected to the computer using two incompatible 7-pin connectors, which were mechanically connected together as part of a larger multi-pin connector on the back of the machine. This eliminated the need for the Y-adaptor. Adaptors for Atari-style \\"digital\\" sticks were also common during this era. The game port became somewhat more common in the mid-1980s, as improving electronic density began to produce expansion cards with ever- increasing functionality. By 1983, it was common to see cards combining memory, game ports, serial and parallel ports and a realtime clock on a single expansion card. The era of combo expansion cards largely came to an end by the late 1980s, as many of the separate functions normally provided on plug-in boards became common features of the motherboard itself. Game ports were not always part of this supported set of ports. However, the game port was given a major boost in usage in 1989, with the introduction of the first Sound Blaster. As sound cards were primarily used with computer games, Creative Labs took the opportunity to include a game port on the card, producing an all-in- one gaming solution. At the same time, they re-purposed two otherwise redundant pins on the port, 12 and 15, to produce a serial bus with enough performance to drive an external MIDI port adaptor. Previous MIDI systems like the MPU-401 used their own separate expansion cards and a complex external adaptor, whereas the Sound Blaster only required an inexpensive adaptor to produce the same result. By the end of the year the Sound Blaster was the best selling expansion card on the PC, and the game port was receiving widespread software support. With the exception of laptops—for which companies released joystick adapters for parallel or serial ports, which needed custom software drivers—through the early 1990s, the game port was universally supported on sound cards, and increasingly became built-in features as motherboards added sound support of their own. This remained true through the second half of the 1990s, by which time integrated sound support had displaced the third-party sound card to a large degree. By the early 2000s, such support was so widespread that newer sound cards began to dispense with the game port as it was certain the machine they would be used in already had such support, including MIDI. The introduction of the first USB standard in 1996, was aimed squarely at the sort of roles provided by the game port, but initially had little market impact. The introduction of the iMac, which was based almost entirely on USB expansion, began a rapid expansion of USB in the market. This led both to new gaming devices using USB, as well as the profusion of adaptors. For instance, the 1997 Microsoft Precision Pro joystick was re- introduced in a version that used a game port connector, but also included a USB adaptor in the box. The rapid takeover of USB meant that this was superfluous when the Precision Pro 2 was released the next year in 1998. By 2000, game ports were purely for backward compatibility with now outdated devices. Microsoft Windows discontinued support for the game port with Windows Vista, though USB converters can serve as a workaround. Hardware The game port's DA-15 connector includes inputs for a total of four analog channels and four buttons. These were almost always implemented as two joysticks with two buttons each, but it is also possible to support four paddle controllers each with one button using the same inputs. The port includes redundant pins, including a total of four +5 V supplies, and separate grounds for most of the buttons. In most similar game ports, like those on the Atari, a single +5 V and ground is used for all the channels. The game port was originally mounted on a dedicated ISA card. Since the early 1990s, when the game port moved from dedicated expansion cards to PC I/O or sound cards, these connectors have usually doubled as connectors for MIDI instruments; two of the redundant +5 V and GND pins of the original standard were rededicated to MIDI input and output to make this possible. To use a game port with MIDI instruments a cable is required with a male and a female DA-15 and two male 5-pin DIN connectors. The drivers and hardware for the game port midi capabilities are based around the Roland MPU-401 MIDI interface (in UART mode only). The analog channels are read by sending voltage into the line, through a potentiometer in the controller, in this case 100,000 ohm, and then into a capacitor. The value is read by timing how long it took for the voltage in the capacitor to cross a certain threshold. The rate varied depending on the resistance, and thus physical position, of the potentiometer. In the Atari port, which had similar analog channels, there is a convenient timer available in the form of the video clock circuitry. In the PC there is no similar clock because video functionality is normally provided on an expansion card. Instead, these timers are provided by a separate chip that combined the voltage readers and timers. When the trigger voltage is reached, the resulting value is copied into a register where it could be read out at any time. The value was being constantly updated by the hardware, but it is up to the software application to poll the value often enough for smooth movement. Software Initially there was no standardized software for running the joysticks; applications would poll the known ports associated with the sticks as part of their game loop. This did, however, leave the implementation of a lot of housekeeping tasks to every application that used them, such as looking for and enumerating the active devices, and calibrating them. This changed in Windows 95, which introduced standardized Windows registry entries to hold these values and make it easier for applications to find these devices. DirectX further expanded the options through DirectInput with the \\"joystick mini-driver\\" with a number of new capabilities. Among these were support for up to six analog axes, a point- of-view hat, and up to 64 buttons. It also supported up to 16 such devices, which could be connected using any interface, not just the game port.

The name \\"Haribo\\" is an acronym formed from Hans Riegel Bonn. The company created the first gummy candy in 1922 in the form of little gummy bears called Gummibärchen. The current headquarters is in Grafschaft, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. The Landesmuseum of Koblenz created a traveling exhibition regarding the history of Haribo in 2006. Haribo Licorice A/S (“Haribo Lakrids A/S”) was founded in 1935 in Faxe in Denmark, 1935, 85 years ago. History Hans Riegel Sr.'s wife Gertrud Riegel was the company’s first employee in 1921. Haribo since expanded its operations, taking over many local confectionery manufacturers in countries all over the world. It began international expansion in the 1960s and entered American markets in the 1980s. As of 2013, it operated 16 factories which produce over 100 million gummy bears per day. Haribo was accused of using Jewish forced labor in its factories during World War II, but denies this. In 2014, Haribo's Skipper Mix was pulled in some markets because some of the candy pieces were shaped like caricatures of Asian, African, and Native American masks that some consumers considered to be racist. UK presence Gummy & Licorice Mix: \\"Haribo Color-Rado\\" Haribo factory in Pontefract. Haribo's key brands in the UK are Starmix, Tangfastics, Supermix, and Maoam, with Maoam being its own line of chewy sweets. They were once the distributor of Pez products in the United Kingdom, but this is no longer the case. Haribo makes Pontefract Cakes at their factory in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, and other locations. US presence Haribo had been imported into the United States for many years in bulk by German food importers and sold at German and other gourmet stores at a large markup. In Germany, Haribo was not an exclusive gourmet product, but a mere candy. When Haribo of America was incorporated in the 1980s in Baltimore, Maryland, Haribo's gummi candies were introduced to the US mass market through retailers such as drugstores, grocery stores, and discount stores. The packaging was translated into English, and package weights were adjusted to match U.S. candy price points and package sizes. A laydown bag was developed for the US supermarket trade, instead of the hanging bag commonly found in German supermarkets, and a boxed product was developed for theaters. Once this was done and Haribo products in US-style packaging were introduced at confectionery and fancy food shows, Haribo became a popular item. Sales soared the first year, and gummy bears became so popular in the US, Haribo in Germany could not supply enough products, so the US market was soon flooded with competitors such as German Trolli and American Black Forest. On 23 March 2017, Haribo announced the opening of their first United States factory, a 500,000 sq ft (46,500 m²), 400 employee manufacturing plant in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, scheduled to open in 2020. International distribution New Haribo factory and thumb Haribo plans to expand to China and Brazil. In China, it has launched test stores in Shanghai and Guangdong. The US headquarters is located in Rosemont, IL. New production facilities opened in Castleford, West Yorkshire, (directly opposite the Normanton M62 Junction (J31)) in 2016 and plans to open in São Paulo, Brazil.Countries with Haribo factories in Europe Slogans Haribo's German catchphrase is „Haribo macht Kinder froh – und Erwachsene ebenso” (\\"Haribo makes children happy – and adults as well\\"). The German advertisements were voiced by Thomas Gottschalk from 1991 until 2015. In English-speaking countries, it uses the slogan \\"Kids and grown-ups love it so – the happy world of Haribo\\". In Hungary, it uses the slogan \\"Gyermek, felnőtt kedve jó – édes élet, Haribo\\" (\\"Child and adult is happy – sweet life, Haribo\\"). \\"Haribo c'est beau la vie, pour les grands et les petits\\" (\\"Haribo life is beautiful, for big ones and little ones\\") is used in France, while in Italy the song used during commercials is: \\"Haribo è la bontà, che si gusta ad ogni età\\" (\\"Haribo is the delicacy that one can taste at any age\\"). In Turkey, it uses the slogan \\"Çocuk ya da büyük ol, Haribo'yla mutlu ol\\" (\\"Be a kid or a grown up, be happy with Haribo\\"). In Denmark, it uses the slogan \\"Luk op for noget godt! Luk op for Haribo! Den er go'\\" (\\"Open for something great! Open for Haribo! It is great\\"). Similar slogans are used in other languages.

The fortress was built on the orders of King Carl X of Sweden following the Treaty of Roskilde, 1658 to protect the newly acquired province of Bohuslän from hostile attacks. The site of Marstrand was chosen because of its location and its access to an ice free port. The fortress was decommissioned as a permanent defense installation in 1882, but remained in military use until the early 1990s.Carlsten Fortress  History  Tower. The highest part of the fortress. After peace in Roskilde in 1658, Bohuslän and thus Marstrand became Swedish. The city has long been a major trading place. Since the harbor almost never freezes, part of the Swedish Navy was stationed here. To defend Marstrand, Karl X Gustav decided to build a fortress on the island. On July 23, 1677, after a attack on the fortifications in Marstrand, Carlsten was conquered by Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve, the Danish military commander in Norway. In 1719, the fortress was attacked and besieged for a second time in its history by the Norwegian Vice-Admiral Tordenskjold, falling into enemy hands. The fortress was returned to Swedish control through negotiations and treaties.  Construction  Carlsten in 1867. In 1658, under the leadership of Johan Wärnschöld, a makeshift fortification was built in the form of a wooden Wahlen skans, at the top of the mountain above the city's \\"big weather mill\\". This fortification was of great use in the fall of 1659 to fight back the attack carried out by Norwegian forces. In 1666, the construction of a replacement building for the wooden edging, which \\"struck\\", began. This new fortress was in the form of a Roman redoubt, or tower building with four small ravelins. In 1671–73, the tower, which was then called Karlsten, was built on one floor and was equipped with a roof battery. Initially a square stone tower was constructed, but in 1681, the construction of a large round shaped tower began, following the commander Carl Gustaf Frölich's design, but otherwise new construction, on drawings created by Erik Dahlbergh, was approved in general in 1685, and as early as 1689 the fortress itself was almost completed, consisting then of a brick redoubt and a high multi-storey tower, which included the former square. Carlsten lighthouse The work was carried out by prisoners sentenced to penal labour. Successive additions to the fortress were carried out until 1860 when it was finally completed. Carlsten was exclusively a prison for men. Nonetheless, Metta Fock, a female prisoner, was to have been kept there 1806-1809. The most famous prisoner of Carlsten was arguably Lasse-Maja, who was imprisoned here in 1813-1838.

History The bay and city originally used the name Diego- Suarez, named after Diogo Soares, a Portuguese navigator who visited the bay in 1543–44.Pierre Van Den Boogaerde, Shipwrecks of Madagascar, p.40 In the 1880s, the bay was coveted by France, which desired it as a coaling station for steamships. After the first Franco-Hova War, Queen Ranavalona III signed a treaty on December 17, 1885, granting France a protectorate over the bay and surrounding territory, as well as the islands of Nosy-Be and Ste.

The Second Pacific Squadron of Imperial Russia anchored and was resupplied at Diego-Suarez on its way to the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. French had surrendered on 13 May 1942. In 1942, Diego-Suárez was the primary objective of Operation Ironclad, the starting point of the Allied invasion and capture of Madagascar. The Allies were concerned that Japan would pressure Vichy France into granting use of Madagascar, as they had with French Indo- China during the previous year, and determined that the island should not be made a base for the interception of Allied shipping. Diego-Suarez, with its superb harbour and a concentration of government officials, was selected as the initial invasion point. The Japanese responded with an attack by midget submarines on the British naval forces in the harbour, damaging the battleship and sinking the oil tanker British Loyalty.Wilson, Michael; (2000), A Submariners War; Stroud, Tempus.

Recognised only by Turkey, Northern Cyprus is considered by the international community to be part of the Republic of Cyprus. Northern Cyprus extends from the tip of the Karpass Peninsula in the northeast to Morphou Bay, Cape Kormakitis and its westernmost point, the Kokkina exclave in the west. Its southernmost point is the village of Louroujina. A buffer zone under the control of the United Nations stretches between Northern Cyprus and the rest of the island and divides Nicosia, the island's largest city and capital of both sides. A coup d'état in 1974, performed as part of an attempt to annex the island to Greece, prompted the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. This resulted in the eviction of much of the north's Greek Cypriot population, the flight of Turkish Cypriots from the south, and the partitioning of the island, leading to a unilateral declaration of independence by the north in 1983. Due to its lack of recognition, Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey for economic, political and military support. Attempts to reach a solution to the Cyprus dispute have been unsuccessful. The Turkish Army maintains a large force in Northern Cyprus. While its presence is supported and approved by the TRNC government, the Republic of Cyprus, the European Union as a whole, and the international community regard it as an occupation force, and its presence has been denounced in several United Nations Security Council resolutions. Northern Cyprus is a semi-presidential, democratic republic with a cultural heritage incorporating various influences and an economy that is dominated by the services sector. The economy has seen growth through the 2000s and 2010s, with the GNP per capita more than tripling in the 2000s, but is held back by an international embargo due to the official closure of the ports in Northern Cyprus by the Republic of Cyprus. The official language is Turkish, with a distinct local dialect being spoken. The vast majority of the population consists of Sunni Muslims, while religious attitudes are mostly moderate and secular. Northern Cyprus is an observer state of ECO and OIC under the title \\"Turkish Cypriot State\\", and of PACE under the title \\"Turkish Cypriot Community\\". History =1960–1974= Fazıl Küçük, former Turkish Cypriot leader and former Vice-President of Cyprus Sarayönü Square of North Nicosia in 1969, after the division of the city A united Cyprus gained independence from British rule in August 1960, after both Greek and Turkish Cypriots agreed to abandon their respective plans for (union with Greece) and (Turkish for \\"partition\\"). The agreement involved Cyprus being governed under a constitution which apportioned Cabinet posts, parliamentary seats and civil service jobs on an agreed ratio between the two communities. Within three years, tensions began to show between the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in administrative affairs. In particular, disputes over separate municipalities and taxation created a deadlock in government. In 1963 President Makarios proposed unilateral changes to the constitution, via 13 amendments. Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots rejected the proposed amendments, claiming that this was an attempt to settle constitutional disputes in favour of the Greek Cypriots and to demote Turkish status from co-founders of the state to one of minority status, removing their constitutional safeguards in the process. Turkish Cypriots filed a lawsuit against the 13 amendments in the Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus (SCCC). Makarios announced that he would not comply with the decision of the SCCC, whatever it was, and defended his amendments as being necessary \\"to resolve constitutional deadlocks\\" as opposed to the stance of the SCCC. On 25 April 1963, the SCCC decided that Makarios's 13 amendments were illegal. The Cyprus Supreme Court's ruling found that Makarios had violated the constitution by failing to fully implement its measures and that Turkish Cypriots had not been allowed to return to their positions in government without first accepting the proposed constitutional amendments. On 21 May, the president of the SCCC resigned due to Makarios's stance. On 15 July, Makarios ignored the decision of the SCCC. After the resignation of the president of the SCCC, the SCCC ceased to exist. The Supreme Court of Cyprus (SCC) was formed by merging the SCCC and the High Court of Cyprus, and undertook the jurisdiction and powers of the SCCC and HCC. On 30 November, Makarios legalised the 13 proposals. In 1963, the Greek Cypriot wing of the government created the Akritas plan which outlined a policy that would remove Turkish Cypriots from the government and ultimately lead to union with Greece. The plan stated that if the Turkish Cypriots objected then they should be \\"violently subjugated before foreign powers could intervene\\". On 21 December 1963, shots were fired at a Turkish Cypriot crowd that had gathered as a Greek police patrol stopped two Turkish Cypriots, claiming to ask for identification; two Turkish Cypriots were killed. Almost immediately, intercommunal violence broke out with a major Greek Cypriot paramilitary attack upon Turkish Cypriots in Nicosia and Larnaca. Though the TMT—a Turkish resistance group created in 1959 to promote a policy of (division or partition of Cyprus), in opposition to the Greek Cypriot nationalist group EOKA and its advocacy of (union of Cyprus with Greece)—committed a number of acts of retaliation, historian of the Cyprus conflict Keith Kyle noted that \\"there is no doubt that the main victims of the numerous incidents that took place during the next few months were Turks\\". Seven hundred Turkish hostages, including children, were taken from the northern suburbs of Nicosia. Nikos Sampson, a nationalist and future coup leader, led a group of Greek Cypriot irregulars into the mixed suburb of Omorphita/Küçük Kaymaklı and attacked the Turkish Cypriot population. By the end of 1964, 364 Turkish Cypriots and 174 Greek Cypriots had been killed. Turkish Cypriot members of the government had by now withdrawn, creating an essentially Greek Cypriot administration in control of all institutions of the state. After the partnership government collapsed, the Greek Cypriot led administration was recognised as the legitimate government of the Republic of Cyprus at the stage of the debates in New York in February 1964. In September 1964, the then United Nations Secretary General, U Thant reported that \\"UNFICYP carried out a detailed survey of all damage to properties throughout the island during the disturbances; it shows that in 109 villages, most of them Turkish-Cypriot or mixed villages, 527 houses have been destroyed while 2,000 others have suffered damage from looting\\". Widespread looting of Turkish Cypriot villages prompted 20,000 refugees to retreat into armed enclaves, where they remained for the next 11 years, relying on food and medical supplies from Turkey to survive. Turkish Cypriots formed paramilitary groups to defend the enclaves, leading to a gradual division of the island's communities into two hostile camps. The violence had also seen thousands of Turkish Cypriots attempt to escape the violence by emigrating to Britain, Australia and Turkey.Quoted in Andrew Borowiec, 2000. Cyprus: A troubled island. Praeger/Greenwood p.58 On 28 December 1967, the Turkish Cypriot Provisional Administration was founded. =1974–1983= Rauf Denktaş, founder and former President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus On 6 July 1974, Makarios accused the Greek government of turning the Cypriot National Guard into an army of occupation.Cyprus Mail, 06 July 1974, \\"Greek Regime Accused by Makarios\\" \\"...President Makarios said yesterday the Athens regime bears great responsibility for what has been in Cyprus, and accused the Greek government of trying to introduce dictatorship and turning the national guard into an army of occupation\\" On 15 July 1974, the Greek military junta and the Cypriot National Guard backed a Greek Cypriot military coup d'état in Cyprus. Pro-Enosis Nikos Sampson replaced President Makarios as the new president. The Greek Cypriot coupists proclaimed the establishment of the \\"Hellenic Republic of Cyprus\\". Turkey claimed that under the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee, the coup was sufficient reason for military action to protect the Turkish Cypriot populace, and thus Turkey invaded Cyprus on 20 July. Turkish forces proceeded to take over the northern four-elevenths of the island (about 36% of Cyprus's total area). The coup caused a civil war filled with ethnic violence, after which it collapsed and Makarios returned to power. On 2 August 1975, in the negotiations in Vienna, a population exchange agreement was signed between community leaders Rauf Denktaş and Glafcos Clerides under the auspices of United Nations. On the basis of the Agreement, 196,000 Greek Cypriots living in the north were exchanged for 42,000 Turkish Cypriots living in the south (the number of settlers was disputed). The Orthodox Greek Cypriots in Rizokarpaso, Agios Andronikos and Agia Triada chose to stay in their villages, as did also Catholic Maronites in Asomatos, Karpasia and Kormakitis. Approximately 1,500 Greek Cypriots and 500 Turkish Cypriots remain missing. The invasion led to the formation of the first sovereign administrative body of Northern Cyprus in August 1974, the Autonomous Turkish Cypriot Administration. In 1975, the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus () was declared as a first step towards a future federated Cypriot state, but was rejected by the Republic of Cyprus and the United Nations. The north unilaterally declared its independence on 15 November 1983 under the name of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. This was rejected by the UN and the Republic of Cyprus. =1983–present= Atatürk Square, North Nicosia in 2006, with the Northern Cyprus and Turkish flags. In recent years, the politics of reunification has dominated the island's affairs. The European Union decided in 2000 to accept Cyprus as a member, even if it was divided. This was due to their view of Rauf Denktaş, the pro-independence Turkish Cypriot President, as the main stumbling block, but also due to Greece threatening to block eastern EU expansion. It was hoped that Cyprus's planned accession into the European Union would act as a catalyst towards a settlement. In the time leading up to Cyprus becoming a member, a new government was elected in Turkey and Rauf Denktaş lost political power in Cyprus. In 2004, a United Nations–brokered peace settlement was presented in a referendum to both sides. The proposed settlement was opposed by both the president of Cyprus, Tassos Papadopoulos, and Turkish Cypriot president Rauf Denktaş; in the referendum, while 65% of Turkish Cypriots accepted the proposal, 76% of Greek Cypriots rejected it. As a result, Cyprus entered the European Union divided, with the effects of membership suspended for Northern Cyprus. Denktaş resigned in the wake of the vote, ushering in the pro-settlement Mehmet Ali Talat as his successor. However, the pro-settlement side and Mehmet Ali Talat lost momentum due to the ongoing embargo and isolation, despite promises from the European Union that these would be eased. As a result, the Turkish Cypriot electorate became frustrated. This led ultimately to the pro-independence side winning the general elections in 2009 and its candidate, former Prime Minister Derviş Eroğlu, winning the presidential elections in 2010. Although Eroğlu and his National Unity Party favours the independence of Northern Cyprus rather than reunification with the Republic of Cyprus, he is negotiating with the Greek Cypriot side towards a settlement for reunification. In 2011, Turkish Cypriots protested against economic reforms made by the Northern Cyprus and Turkish governments; see 2011 Turkish Cypriot demonstrations. Administrative divisions Northern Cyprus is divided into six districts: Lefkoşa, Gazimağusa, Girne, Güzelyurt, İskele and Lefke. Lefke District was established by separation from the Güzelyurt District in 2016. In addition there are further twelve sub-districts divided between the five larger districts and twenty-eight municipalities. Blank district map of Northern Cyprus Lefkoşa Girne İskele Güzelyurt Gazimağusa Politics Mustafa Akıncı, the President of Northern Cyprus The politics of Northern Cyprus takes place in a framework of a semi-presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President is head of state and the Prime Minister head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Assembly of the Republic. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term and is currently Mustafa Akıncı. The current Prime Minister is Ersin Tatar. The legislature is the Assembly of the Republic, which has 50 members elected by proportional representation from six electoral districts. In the elections of January 2018, the right-wing National Unity Party won the most seats in the Assembly, and the current government is a coalition of the National Unity Party and the centrist People's Party. Due to Northern Cyprus's isolation and heavy reliance on Turkish support, Turkey has a high level of influence over the country's politics. This has led to some experts characterising it as an effective puppet state of Turkey. Other experts, however, have pointed out to the independent nature of elections and appointments in Northern Cyprus and disputes between the Turkish Cypriot and Turkish governments, concluding that \\"puppet state\\" is not an accurate description for Northern Cyprus. =Human rights and law= The law courts building in North Nicosia In January 2011, The Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the question of Human Rights in Cyprus noted that the ongoing division of Cyprus continues to affect human rights throughout the island \\"... including freedom of movement, human rights pertaining to the question of missing persons, discrimination, the right to life, freedom of religion, and economic, social and cultural rights.\\" Freedom House has classified the perceived level of democratic and political freedom in Northern Cyprus as \\"free\\" since 2000 in its Freedom in the World report. The 2016 ranking was \\"free\\" with the scores (1: most free, 7: least free) political rights: 2/7, civil liberties: 2/7 and aggregate score: 79/100.

Mustafa Akıncı with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, 2 October 2015 No nation other than Turkey has officially recognised Northern Cyprus as a sovereign state. The United Nations recognises it as territory of the Republic of Cyprus under Turkish occupation. Pakistan and Bangladesh had initially declared their recognition of Northern Cyprus as a sovereign state shortly after its declaration of independence,Commentary Michael Rubin (7 July 2014):\\"Is Now the Time for a Cyprus Deal?\\" but they withdrew their recognition as a result of US pressure after the UN deemed the declaration illegal.Inter City Press Matthew Russell Lee: \\"At UN, Turkish Cypriot Community Has Rare Diplomatic Status, Non State Envy\\" The United Nations considers the declaration of independence by Northern Cyprus as legally invalid, as enunciated in several of its resolutions. In the wake of the April 2004 referendum on the United Nations Annan Plan, and in view of the support of the Turkish Cypriot community for the plan, the European Union made pledges towards ending the isolation of Northern Cyprus. These included measures for trade and €259 million in aid. A pledge by the EU to lift the embargo on Northern Cyprus in the wake of the Annan Plan referendums has been blocked by the Greek Cypriot government. In 2004, the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation upgraded the delegation of the Turkish Cypriot Muslim community from \\"observer community\\" (1979) to that of a constituent state with the designation \\"Turkish Cypriot State\\", making Northern Cyprus an observer member of the organisation. A number of high- profile formal meetings have also taken place between Turkish Cypriot presidents and various foreign leaders and politicians. In 2004, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe gave observer status to the representatives of Turkish Cypriot community. Since then, Northern Cyprus's representatives have actively participated in all PACE activities without voting rights. The European Union considers the area not under effective control of the Republic of Cyprus as EU territory under Turkish military occupation and thus indefinitely exempt from EU legislation until a settlement has been found. The status of Northern Cyprus has become a recurrent issue especially during the recent talks for Turkey's membership of the EU where the division of the island is seen as a major stumbling block in Turkey's road to membership. The Autonomous Republic of Nakhichevan in Azerbaijan has issued a resolution recognising the independence of Northern Cyprus. As a result of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, however, Azerbaijan itself has not recognised North Cyprus. Turkish Cypriots have been applying for decades for passports issued by Cyprus. When the entry points with the Republic of Cyprus were closed, the applications were made either through middlemen or through consulates and embassies of Cyprus in other countries. A yearly increase in the number of applications for such passports of 10–15% was observed in years prior to 2001, when the rate greatly increased and 817 were issued in the first eight months of 2001 as compared to 448 for the whole of 2000. After the opening of the borders with the Republic of Cyprus, Turkish Cypriots started line-ups applying for Cypriot passports by visiting the Republic of Cyprus and showing proof of their Cypriot ancestry. There are seven border crossings between Northern Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus. Since May 2004 some tourists have taken to flying to the Republic of Cyprus directly then crossing the green line to holiday in Northern Cyprus. On 21 September 2011, Turkey and Northern Cyprus signed an EEZ border agreement in New York.Official Gazette 12 July 2012Official Gazette EEZ Border (Page 4) In October 2012, Northern Cyprus became an observer member of the Economic Cooperation Organization under the name \\"Turkish Cypriot State\\". =Military= Turkish Cypriot soldiers of the Security Forces Command perform during a Republic Day parade.

There is also an additional reserve force which consists of about 10,000 first-line and 16,000 second-line troops conscripted up to the age of 50. The Security Forces Command is lightly armed and heavily dependent on its mainland Turkish allies, from which it draws much of its officer corps. It is led by a Brigadier General drawn from the Turkish Army. It acts essentially as a gendarmerie charged with protection of the border of Northern Cyprus from Greek Cypriot incursions and maintaining internal security within Northern Cyprus.\\"Cyprus.\\" Jane's Sentinel: Eastern Mediterranean, issue 22, 2007. In addition, the mainland Turkish Armed Forces maintains the Cyprus Turkish Peace Force which consists of around 30,000–40,000 troops drawn from the 9th Turkish Army Corps and comprising two divisions, the 28th and 39th. It is equipped with a substantial number of US-made M48 Patton main battle tanks and artillery weapons. The Turkish Air Force, Turkish Navy and Turkish Coast Guard also have a presence in Northern Cyprus. Although formally part of Turkish 4th Army, headquartered in İzmir, the sensitivities of the Cyprus situation means that the commander of the Cyprus Turkish Peace Force also reports directly to the Turkish General Staff in Ankara. The Cyprus Turkish Peace Force is deployed principally along the Green Line and in locations where hostile amphibious landings might take place. The presence of the mainland Turkish military in Cyprus is highly controversial, having been denounced as an occupation force by the Republic of Cyprus and the international community. Several United Nations Security Council resolutions have called on the Turkish forces to withdraw.UN Security Council resolutions 353, 357, 358, 359, 360, and 365, all from 1974.

The Mesaoria plain, extending from the Güzelyurt district to the eastern coastline is another defining landscape. The Mesaoria plains consist of plain fields and small hills, and is crossed by several seasonal streams.

The economy of Northern Cyprus is dominated by the services sector (69% of GDP in 2007) which includes the public sector, trade, tourism and education. The revenues gained by the education sector in 2011 was $400 million. Industry (light manufacturing) contributes 22% of GDP and agriculture 9%. The economy of Northern Cyprus is based on a free market approach and it became the top country in Europe in entrepreneurial intent to start a new business in 2014. Economic development is adversely affected by the continuing Cyprus problem. Northern Cyprus is under an international embargo as the Republic of Cyprus, as the internationally recognised authority, has declared airports and ports in the area not under its effective control closed. All UN member states other than Turkey respect the closure of those ports and airports. As a result, Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkish economic support, and is still dependent on monetary transfers from the Turkish government. Northern Cyprus uses the Turkish Lira as its currency which links its economy to that of Turkey's. Since the Republic of Cyprus joined the Euro zone and the movement of peoples between the north and south has become more free, the Euro is also in wide circulation. Exports and imports have to go via Turkey; while European Union promised an opening up of the ports after the Annan plan, this was blocked by the Republic of Cyprus and exporting through the south, while technically possible, remains impractical. Despite the constraints imposed by the lack of international recognition, the nominal GDP growth rates of the economy in 2001–2005 were 5.4%, 6.9%, 11.4%, 15.4% and 10.6%, respectively. The real GDP growth rate in 2007 was estimated at 2%. This growth has been buoyed by the relative stability of the Turkish Lira and a boom in the education and construction sectors. Between 2002 and 2007, Gross National Product per capita more than tripled, from US$4,409 in 2002 to US$16,158 (in current U.S. dollars). The growth continued through the 2010s, with real growth rates of 3.7%, 3.9%, 1.8% and 1.1% respectively in 2010–2013. The unemployment rate declined through the 2010s and was at 8.3% in 2014.TRNC SPO Economic and Social Indicators 2014, p.3 In 2011, North Cyprus sold electricity to the Republic of Cyprus following an explosion in the southern part of the island which affected a large power station. The Northern Cyprus Water Supply Project, completed in 2015, is aimed at delivering water for drinking and irrigation from southern Turkey via a pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea. International telephone calls are routed via a Turkish dialling code (+90 392) as Northern Cyprus has neither its own country code nor official ITU prefix. Similarly with the internet Northern Cyprus has no top level domain of its own and is under the Turkish second-level domain .nc.tr. Items of mail must be addressed 'via Mersin 10, TURKEY' as the Universal Postal Union does not recognise Northern Cyprus as a separate entity. Amateur radio operators sometimes use callsigns beginning with \\"1B\\", but these have no standing for awards or other operating credit. =Tourism= Venetian-era Kyrenia Castle on the far left, and the Kyrenia Mountains in the background Tourism is considered as one of the driving sectors of the Turkish Cypriot economy. The country received over 1.1 million tourists in 2012, when hotels and restaurants generated an income of $328 million and constituted 8.5% of the GDP. Accommodation and catering created more than 10,000 jobs in the same year. The tourism sector has seen great development in the 2000s and 2010s, with the number of tourists more than doubling, increased investment and hotel construction; official estimates of income derived from tourism were around 700 million US dollars in 2013 and the total bed capacity was estimated to be around 20,000. Casino tourism is one of the major sectors of the North Cyprus economy. Kyrenia is considered the capital of tourism in Northern Cyprus, with its numerous hotels, entertainment facilities, vibrant nightlife and shopping areas. In 2012, 62.7% of the visitors in Northern Cyprus stayed in the Girne District during their visit. Out of the 145 hotels in Northern Cyprus, 99 were in the Girne District in 2013. Northern Cyprus has traditionally been an attraction for beach holidays, partly thanks to its reputation as an unspoiled area. Its mild climate, rich history and nature are seen as sources of attraction. A significant sector of eco-tourism has been developed in Northern Cyprus, as tourists visit it for bird watching, cycling, walking and observing flowers in the wild. It is praised for its relative safety, and especially for the Karpass Peninsula, its well-preservation. The peninsula is home to several sorts of tourism: it hosts the Bafra Tourism Area as a center for beach-goers, where four luxurious and large hotels were built until 2014, several facilities and regular festivals that highlight its rural qualities and exhibit local traditions, a remote natural park, the Kantara Castle attracting sightseers, and a marina that was built to host international yachts and boats, along with large facilities. Casino tourism has also grown to become a significant contribution to the economy in Northern Cyprus. They were first opened in the 1990s, and have since become very popular with visitors from Turkey and the rest of the island, where casinos are banned. This has led to huge investments in the casino sector. However, the sector has been criticised due to claims of its lack of benefits for the small and middle-scale business and shop owners. The \\"nightclubs\\" that have been established for prostitution attract sex tourism to Northern Cyprus and the industry has been described as a \\"civilized one\\", despite the sex workers being described as \\"vulnerable to abuse\\". =Infrastructure= The Ercan International Airport serves as the main port of entry into Northern Cyprus. The share of the transport and communications industry in the GDP of Northern Cyprus is constantly varying; it decreased from 12.1% in 2008 to 8.5% in 2011, but rose again to 9.3% in 2012. Air transport is a major route of entry into Northern Cyprus. The country is home to two airports, the Ercan International Airport and the Geçitkale Airport, of which only Ercan is currently functioning. The Ercan airport saw an important renovation in the 2010s that greatly increased its passenger traffic, it was used by 1.76 million passengers in the first seven months of 2014 alone. Non-stop flights are only available from multiple points in Turkey through a number of Turkish carriers. Direct scheduled and charter flights take place from other countries, but with mandatory stopovers in Turkey. 600 charter flights were scheduled for 2013. Scheduled destinations include cities such as London and Manchester, while charter flight destinations include cities such as Berlin and Ljubljana. Direct flights to Northern Cyprus and the trade traffic through the Northern Cypriot ports are restricted as part of the embargo on Northern Cypriot ports. The airports of Geçitkale and Ercan are only recognised as legal ports of entry by Turkey and Azerbaijan. Direct charter flights between Poland and North Cyprus started on 20 June 2011. The seaports in Famagusta and Kyrenia have been declared closed to all shipping by the Republic of Cyprus since 1974. By agreement between Northern Cyprus and Syria, there was a ship tour between Famagusta and Latakia, Syria before the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War. Since the opening of the Green Line Turkish Cypriot residents are allowed to trade through ports recognized by the Republic of Cyprus. With the lack of a railway system, the country's highways are used for transport between major cities. In the 21st century, these highways were upgraded into dual carriageways, with some roads in the Karpass area still being upgraded . Northern Cyprus has around of roads, with two thirds of these roads paved. Recent constructions included the construction of a Northern Coast Highway, which was hailed as a major incentive for economic development. Demographics Turkish Cypriot children in the walled part of North Nicosia Northern Cyprus's first official census was performed in 1996. The population recorded was 200,587. The second census, carried out in 2006, revealed the population of Northern Cyprus to be 265,100, of which majority is composed of indigenous Turkish Cypriots (including refugees from Southern Cyprus) and settlers from Turkey. Of the 178,000 Turkish Cypriot citizens, 82% are native Cypriots (145,000). Of the 45,000 people born to non-Cypriot parentage, nearly 40% (17,000) were born in Cyprus. The figure for non-citizens, including students, guest workers and temporary residents stood at 78,000 people. The third official census of Northern Cyprus was carried out in 2011, made under the auspices of UN observers. It returned a total population of 294,906. These results were disputed by some political parties, labour unions and local newspapers. The government was accused of deliberately under-counting the population, after apparently giving an estimate of 700,000 before the census, in order to demand financial help from Turkey. One source claims that the population in the north has reached 500,000, split between 50% Turkish Cypriots and 50% Turkish settlers or Cypriot-born children of such settlers. Researcher Mete Hatay has written that such reports are \\"wildly speculative\\" and are picked up by opposition parties for political benefit, which resulted in reports in the south. Such reports have never been scientifically or statistically scrutinised, despite opportunities of opposition parties to do so using the electoral rolls in their possession, thereby continuing a \\"war of numbers\\". The Government of Northern Cyprus estimates that the 1983 population of Northern Cyprus was 155,521. Estimates by the government of the Republic of Cyprus from 2001 place the population at 200,000, of which 80–89,000 are Turkish Cypriots and 109,000–117,000 are designated as Turkish settlers by the Republic of Cyprus. An island-wide census in 1960 indicated the number of Turkish Cypriots as 102,000 and Greek Cypriots as 450,000. , the settlers constituted no more than 25% of the electorate in Northern Cyprus. The degree of the integration of mainland Turks to the Turkish Cypriot community varies; some identify as Turkish Cypriots and have culturally integrated, while some embrace a Turkish identity.Hatay, Mete (2005) Beyond Numbers: An Inquiry into the Political Integration of the Turkish 'Settlers' in Northern Cyprus , PRIO Report, 4. Oslo/Nicosia: PRIO Cyprus Centre. Northern Cyprus is almost entirely Turkish-speaking. English, however, is widely spoken as a second language. There are 644 Greek Cypriots living in Rizokarpaso (Dipkarpaz) and 364 Maronites in Kormakitis. 162,000 Greek Cypriots were forcibly evicted from their homes in the North by the invading force of the Turkish army. Rizokarpaso is the home of the biggest Greek-speaking population in the north. The Greek-Cypriot inhabitants are still supplied by the UN, and Greek-Cypriot products are consequently available in some shops. =Religion= Arab Ahmet Mosque in North Nicosia The majority of Turkish Cypriots (99%) are Sunni Muslims. Northern Cyprus is a secular state.. Alcohol is frequently consumed within the community and most Turkish Cypriot women do not cover their heads; however headscarves are still worn on occasion by public figures as a symbol of the inhabitants' Turkish culture, or simply as a conservative form of dress. However, some religious traditions still play a role within the community. Turkish Cypriot males are generally circumcised in accordance with religious beliefs.. =Education= Girne American University in Kyrenia, Northern Cyprus The education system in Northern Cyprus consists of pre-school education, primary education, secondary education and higher education. Five years of primary education is mandatory. Higher Education Planning Evaluation Accreditation and Coordination Council (YÖDAK) of Northern Cyprus is a member of International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education (INQAAHE). In 2013 there were 63,765 university students from 114 countries in nine universities in Northern Cyprus. In 2014, the number of students increased to 70,004, (15,210 Turkish Cypriots; 36,148 from Turkey; 18,646 international students):Kibris Postasi 24 October 2014 70,000 students enrolled to the universities Near East University (NEU), Girne American University, Middle East Technical University-TRNC, European University of Lefke, Cyprus International University, Eastern Mediterranean University (EMU), Istanbul Technical University-TRNC, University of Mediterranean Karpasia, and University of Kyrenia, all established since 1974. EMU is an internationally recognised institution of higher learning with more than 1000 faculty members from 35 countries. There are 15,000 students in EMU representing 68 nationalities. The 8 universities have been approved by the Higher Education Council of Turkey. Eastern Mediterranean University and Near East University are full individual members of the European University Association. EMU is a full member of the Community of Mediterranean Universities, Federation Universities of Islamic World, International Association of Universities and International Council of Graphic Design Associations, and was ranked as the best university in the island and among the top 500 in Europe by Webometrics.Eastern Mediterranean University , Webometrics, retrieved on 30 December 2014. Girne American University, in the northern coastal city of Kyrenia, opened a campus in Canterbury, United Kingdom in 2009, and was accredited by the British Accreditation Council in 2010. Northern Cyprus regularly participates in international Robocup competition, and took 14th place out of 20 in 2013. The country has supercomputers with which it participates in CERN experiments that led to the discovery of the Higgs boson. Northern Cyprus is among participant countries of Solar Challenge of solar powered vehicles in South Africa in 2014. Culture = Music and dance = Ziynet Sali is a Turkish Cypriot pop singer famous in Turkey and Northern Cyprus. Turkish Cypriot children, dressed in traditional clothing, preparing for a folk-dance show Turkish Cypriot folk music consists of a rich variety of local tunes, influenced by the mainland Turkish music to a limited extent. Historically, it was shaped around the tradition of weddings, the primary social gatherings at the time. Violin, goblet drum, known locally as \\"darbuka\\", zurna and other drums were heavily used in these gatherings, and a large number of traditional songs developed based on this legacy. Turkish Cypriot culture also incorporates a great diversity of folk dances with various influences, including different versions of karsilamas, çiftetelli and zeybek. The Northern Cyprus State Symphony Orchestra has been active since 1975. The Bellapais Abbey in Kyrenia hosts international festivals of classical music, and is considered in important platform of classical music. North Nicosia has its own Nicosia Municipal Orchestra that performs at open spaces, such as parks and squares, and is also home to the annual Walled City Jazz Festival. Rüya Taner is a Turkish Cypriot pianist who has achieved international acclaim. Turkish Cypriot cities and towns regularly organise festivals that include performances of local and international singers and bands. Some Turkish Cypriot singers, such as Ziynet Sali and Işın Karaca, have achieved fame in Turkey. The Turkish Cypriot band Sıla 4 produced music that is considered essential for the Turkish Cypriot identity, and also acquired fame in Turkey. Rock and pop music are popular with the public in Northern Cyprus, important singers and bands include SOS and Fikri Karayel. =Literature= Poetry is the most widely published form of literature in Northern Cyprus. Turkish Cypriot poetry is based on both the effects of Turkish literature and the culture of the island of Cyprus, along with some reflection of the British colonial history. The first era of Turkish Cypriot poetry after the introduction of the Latin alphabet, characterised by poets such as Nazif Süleyman Ebeoğlu, Urkiye Mine Balman, Engin Gönül, Necla Salih Suphi and Pembe Marmara, had strong nationalistic elements due to the political attitudes of Turkish Cypriots at the time and stylistically reflected the poetry of the Turkish mainland. Meanwhile, other poets, such as Özker Yaşın, Osman Türkay, who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature twice,Kozmik şiirin yazarı (Hürriyet), retrieved on 31 December 2014. and Nevzat Yalçın sought to write in more original styles, with the influence of nascent poetic styles in Turkey and those in Britain. This group of poets were very prolific and increased the popularity of poetry in the Turkish Cypriot community, and are seen as key figures in Turkish Cypriot literature.Turan, Metin. Çağdaş Kıbrıs Türk Şiirinde Eğilimler/ Yönelimler (Çukurova University) Retrieved on 27 May 2012. The nationalism gave way to a notion of Cypriotness in the 1970s, with the influence of Yaşın, Türkay and Yalçın. During this period, the so-called \\"1974 generation of poets\\" arose, led by poets including Mehmet Yaşın, Hakkı Yücel, Nice Denizoğlu, Neşe Yaşın, Ayşen Dağlı and Canan Sümer. The poetry of this generation was characterised by the appreciation of the Turkish Cypriot identity as distinct from Turkish identity and the identification of Cyprus as the Turkish Cypriot homeland instead of Turkey, in contrast to the previous nationalist poetry. This approach is often called the \\"Cypriot poetry of rejection\\" as it resists the influence of Turkey, highlighting the cultural rift between Turkey and Cyprus due to the recent experience of war and therefore the independence of the Turkish Cypriot poetry and identity. This was followed by an increased adoption of the Mediterranean identity in the 1980s, accompanied by the effects of the liberalisation of the Turkish Cypriot society, as reflected in the feminist elements, of which a particular example is Neriman Cahit.\\"Boşluğun hasadı kalemledir\\" (Radikal) retrieved on 31 December 2014. =Cinema= Anahtar (Key), released in 2011, was the first full-length film entirely produced in Northern Cyprus. Some other co-productions have also taken place. A co-production of Northern Cyprus, Turkey, Britain and the Netherlands, Kod Adı Venüs (Code Name Venus) was shown in the Cannes Film Festival in 2012. The film director and screenwriter Derviş Zaim achieved fame with his 2003 film Mud (Çamur) which won the UNESCO award at the Venice Film Festival. The documentary film Kayıp Otobüs (The Missing Bus), directed by Turkish Cypriot journalist Fevzi Tașpınar, was aired on the TRT TV as well as participating in the Boston Film Festival in 2011. The film tells the story of eleven Turkish Cypriot workers who left their homes in a bus in 1964 that never came back. Their remains were found in a well in Cyprus in October 2006. =Theatre= Karagöz and Hacivat An early Turkish Cypriot theatre group, 1880s Theatre in Northern Cyprus is mostly carried out by the Turkish Cypriot State Theatre, municipal theatres and a number of private theatrical companies. Cyprus Theatre Festival, organised by the Nicosia Turkish Municipality is a large organisation with institutions from Turkey participating as well. There are no major halls built specifically for theatre in Northern Cyprus, so plays often take place in conference halls.TRNC State Planning Organization. 2008 Yılı Makroekonomik ve Sektörel Gelişmeler, June 2010, p. 169.Kıbrıs Tiyatro Festivali. Nicosia Turkish Municipality and Nicosia Municipal Theatre. The origins of Turkish Cypriot theatre lie in Karagöz and Hacivat, a shadow play that was popularised in the island as a form of entertainment during the Ottoman era. This form of theatre has lost its popularity nowadays, but remains to be televised during religious festivals.Turkish-Cypriot Theatres , cypnet.co.uk, retrieved on 28 December 2014. After the 1840s, as the Ottoman Empire started modernising, theatre with greater European elements met with the Turkish Cypriot public. However, the inception of Turkish Cypriot theatre in the modern sense is considered the staging of the play \\"Vatan Yahut Silistre\\" (\\"Homeland vs. Silistra\\") by Turkish playwright Namık Kemal in 1908.Cihangir, Yurdal. THE PRIMARY YEARS OF TURKISH CYPRIOT PLAY-WRITING AND \\"SAFA YAHUT NETİCE-İ İBTİLA , Turkish Studies, retrieved on 28 December 2014. This was followed by a proliferation of theatrical activity in the Turkish Cypriot community as local plays were written and staged and theatrical companies from Turkey took the stage in Cyprus by the 1920s, all the major towns in Cyprus had Turkish Cypriot plays that were performed regularly. In the 1960s, Turkish Cypriot theatre started to be institutionalised. A leading theatre group named \\"İlk Sahne\\" (First Stage), founded in 1963, was renamed the Turkish Cypriot State Theatre in 1966, and has since performed more than 85 plays.Kuzey Kıbrıs’ın Kültürel ve Sosyal Yaşamı , University of Kyrenia, retrieved on 28 December 2014. Theatre is currently a very popular form of art in Northern Cyprus, with long queues forming for tickets of the plays in the Cyprus Theatre Festival, and the number of theatre-goers constantly increasing.Bilet satışı başladı , Yeni Düzen, retrieved on 28 December 2014. =Sports= Nicosia Atatürk Stadium is the largest stadium in Northern Cyprus. There are five stadiums in Northern Cyprus, with each holding a capacity ranging anywhere from 7,000 to 30,000. The most popular sport in Northern Cyprus is football. There are over 29 sport federations in Northern Cyprus with a total registered membership of 13,950 6,054 been registered practitioners for, taekwondo-karate-aikido- kurash, with shooting having 1,150 (registered) and hunting having 1,017 (registered) members.TRNC State Planning Organization. 2008 Yılı Makroekonomik ve Sektörel Gelişmeler, p.176-179. Northern Cyprus' national football team currently ranks 109th in the Elo Ratings. Several of sport clubs participate in leagues in Turkey. These include the Fast Break Sport Club in Turkey's Men's Basketball Regional League; the Beşparmak Sport Club in Turkey's Handball Premier League; and the Lefke European University Turkey Table-tennis Super League. Water sports such as windsurfing, jetskiing, waterskiing and sailing are also available at beaches throughout the coastline of Northern Cyprus. Sailing is especially found at Escape Beach Club, near Kyrenia. =Cuisine= Northern Cyprus is also well known for several dishes; among them are kebabs made of skewered lamb (şiş kebab) or ground with herbs and spices and made into a kofte or şeftali kebab. Other dishes are based on meat wrapped in flat bread such as lahmacun. Vegetarian cuisine includes stuffed vegetable based dishes \\"yalancı dolma\\" or many other dishes made with a bean or pulse such as börülce which consists of Swiss chard cooked with black-eyed peas. There are also plant based foods such as molohiya or root based stews such as kolokas.

Patricia S. Churchland, Christof Koch, Terrence J. Sejnowski. in Computational Neuroscience pp.46-55. Edited by Eric L. Schwartz. 1993. MIT Press In theory, computational neuroscience would be a sub-field of theoretical neuroscience which employs computational simulations to validate and solve the mathematical models. However, since the biologically plausible mathematical models formulated in neuroscience are in most cases too complex to be solved analytically, the two terms are essentially synonyms and are used interchangeably. The term mathematical neuroscience is also used sometimes, to stress the quantitative nature of the field. Computational neuroscience focuses on the description of biologically plausible neurons (and neural systems) and their physiology and dynamics, and it is therefore not directly concerned with biologically unrealistic models used in connectionism, control theory, cybernetics, quantitative psychology, machine learning, artificial neural networks, artificial intelligence and computational learning theory; although mutual inspiration exists and sometimes there is no strict limit between fields, with model abstraction in computational neuroscience depending on research scope and the granularity at which biological entities are analyzed. Models in theoretical neuroscience are aimed at capturing the essential features of the biological system at multiple spatial-temporal scales, from membrane currents, and chemical coupling via network oscillations, columnar and topographic architecture, nuclei, all the way up to psychological faculties like memory, learning and behavior. These computational models frame hypotheses that can be directly tested by biological or psychological experiments. History The term 'computational neuroscience' was introduced by Eric L. Schwartz, who organized a conference, held in 1985 in Carmel, California, at the request of the Systems Development Foundation to provide a summary of the current status of a field which until that point was referred to by a variety of names, such as neural modeling, brain theory and neural networks. The proceedings of this definitional meeting were published in 1990 as the book Computational Neuroscience. The first open international meeting focused on Computational Neuroscience was organized by James M. Bower and John Miller in San Francisco, California in 1989 and has continued each year since as the annual CNS meeting. The first graduate educational program in computational neuroscience was organized as the Computational and Neural Systems Ph.D. program at the California Institute of Technology in 1985. The early historical roots of the field can be traced to the work of people such as Louis Lapicque, Hodgkin & Huxley, Hubel & Wiesel, and David Marr, to name a few. Lapicque introduced the integrate and fire model of the neuron in a seminal article published in 1907. This model is still popular today for artificial neural networks studies because of its simplicity (see a recent review). About 40 years later, Hodgkin & Huxley developed the voltage clamp and created the first biophysical model of the action potential. Hubel & Wiesel discovered that neurons in the primary visual cortex, the first cortical area to process information coming from the retina, have oriented receptive fields and are organized in columns. David Marr's work focused on the interactions between neurons, suggesting computational approaches to the study of how functional groups of neurons within the hippocampus and neocortex interact, store, process, and transmit information. Computational modeling of biophysically realistic neurons and dendrites began with the work of Wilfrid Rall, with the first multicompartmental model using cable theory. Major topics Research in computational neuroscience can be roughly categorized into several lines of inquiry. Most computational neuroscientists collaborate closely with experimentalists in analyzing novel data and synthesizing new models of biological phenomena. =Single-neuron modeling= Even single neurons have complex biophysical characteristics and can perform computations (e.g.). Hodgkin and Huxley's original model only employed two voltage-sensitive currents (Voltage sensitive ion channels are glycoprotein molecules which extend through the lipid bilayer, allowing ions to traverse under certain conditions through the axolemma), the fast-acting sodium and the inward-rectifying potassium. Though successful in predicting the timing and qualitative features of the action potential, it nevertheless failed to predict a number of important features such as adaptation and shunting. Scientists now believe that there are a wide variety of voltage- sensitive currents, and the implications of the differing dynamics, modulations, and sensitivity of these currents is an important topic of computational neuroscience. The computational functions of complex dendrites are also under intense investigation. There is a large body of literature regarding how different currents interact with geometric properties of neurons. Some models are also tracking biochemical pathways at very small scales such as spines or synaptic clefts. There are many software packages, such as GENESIS and NEURON, that allow rapid and systematic in silico modeling of realistic neurons. Blue Brain, a project founded by Henry Markram from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, aims to construct a biophysically detailed simulation of a cortical column on the Blue Gene supercomputer. Modeling the richness of biophysical properties on the single-neuron scale can supply mechanisms that serve as the building blocks for network dynamics. However, detailed neuron descriptions are computationally expensive and this can handicap the pursuit of realistic network investigations, where many neurons need to be simulated. As a result, researchers that study large neural circuits typically represent each neuron and synapse with an artificially simple model, ignoring much of the biological detail. Hence there is a drive to produce simplified neuron models that can retain significant biological fidelity at a low computational overhead. Algorithms have been developed to produce faithful, faster running, simplified surrogate neuron models from computationally expensive, detailed neuron models. =Development, axonal patterning, and guidance= Computational neuroscience aims to address a wide array of questions. How do axons and dendrites form during development? How do axons know where to target and how to reach these targets? How do neurons migrate to the proper position in the central and peripheral systems? How do synapses form? We know from molecular biology that distinct parts of the nervous system release distinct chemical cues, from growth factors to hormones that modulate and influence the growth and development of functional connections between neurons. Theoretical investigations into the formation and patterning of synaptic connection and morphology are still nascent. One hypothesis that has recently garnered some attention is the minimal wiring hypothesis, which postulates that the formation of axons and dendrites effectively minimizes resource allocation while maintaining maximal information storage. Review article =Sensory processing= Early models on sensory processing understood within a theoretical framework are credited to Horace Barlow. Somewhat similar to the minimal wiring hypothesis described in the preceding section, Barlow understood the processing of the early sensory systems to be a form of efficient coding, where the neurons encoded information which minimized the number of spikes. Experimental and computational work have since supported this hypothesis in one form or another. For the example of visual processing, efficient coding is manifested in the forms of efficient spatial coding, color coding, temporal/motion coding, stereo coding, and combinations of them.Zhaoping L. 2014, The efficient coding principle , chapter 3, of the textbook Understanding vision: theory, models, and data Further along the visual pathway, even the efficiently coded visual information is too much for the capacity of the information bottleneck, the visual attentional bottleneck.see visual spational attention https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_spatial_attention A subsequent theory has been developed on exogenous attentional selection of visual input information for further processing guided by a bottom-up saliency map in the primary visual cortex.Li. Z. 2002 A saliency map in primary visual cortex Trends in Cognitive Sciences vol. 6, Pages 9-16, and Zhaoping, L. 2014, The V1 hypothesis—creating a bottom-up saliency map for preattentive selection and segmentation in the book Understanding Vision: Theory, Models, and Data Current research in sensory processing is divided among a biophysical modelling of different subsystems and a more theoretical modelling of perception. Current models of perception have suggested that the brain performs some form of Bayesian inference and integration of different sensory information in generating our perception of the physical world. =Motor control= Many models of the way the brain controls movement have been developed. This includes models of processing in the brain such as the cerebellum's role for error correction, skill learning in motor cortex and the basal ganglia, or the control of the vestibulo ocular reflex. This also includes many normative models, such as those of the Bayesian or optimal control flavor which are built on the idea that the brain efficiently solves its problems. =Memory and synaptic plasticity= Earlier models of memory are primarily based on the postulates of Hebbian learning. Biologically relevant models such as Hopfield net have been developed to address the properties of associative (also known as \\"content-addressable\\") style of memory that occur in biological systems. These attempts are primarily focusing on the formation of medium- and long-term memory, localizing in the hippocampus. Models of working memory, relying on theories of network oscillations and persistent activity, have been built to capture some features of the prefrontal cortex in context-related memory. Additional models look at the close relationship between the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex and how that contributes to working memory. One of the major problems in neurophysiological memory is how it is maintained and changed through multiple time scales. Unstable synapses are easy to train but also prone to stochastic disruption. Stable synapses forget less easily, but they are also harder to consolidate. One recent computational hypothesis involves cascades of plasticity that allow synapses to function at multiple time scales. Stereochemically detailed models of the acetylcholine receptor-based synapse with the Monte Carlo method, working at the time scale of microseconds, have been built. It is likely that computational tools will contribute greatly to our understanding of how synapses function and change in relation to external stimulus in the coming decades. =Behaviors of networks= Biological neurons are connected to each other in a complex, recurrent fashion. These connections are, unlike most artificial neural networks, sparse and usually specific. It is not known how information is transmitted through such sparsely connected networks, although specific areas of the brain, such as the Visual cortex, are understood in some detail. It is also unknown what the computational functions of these specific connectivity patterns are, if any. The interactions of neurons in a small network can be often reduced to simple models such as the Ising model. The statistical mechanics of such simple systems are well- characterized theoretically. There has been some recent evidence that suggests that dynamics of arbitrary neuronal networks can be reduced to pairwise interactions. It is not known, however, whether such descriptive dynamics impart any important computational function. With the emergence of two-photon microscopy and calcium imaging, we now have powerful experimental methods with which to test the new theories regarding neuronal networks. In some cases the complex interactions between inhibitory and excitatory neurons can be simplified using mean field theory, which gives rise to the population model of neural networks. While many neurotheorists prefer such models with reduced complexity, others argue that uncovering structural-functional relations depends on including as much neuronal and network structure as possible. Models of this type are typically built in large simulation platforms like GENESIS or NEURON. There have been some attempts to provide unified methods that bridge and integrate these levels of complexity. =Visual attention, identification, and categorization = Visual attention can be described as a set of mechanisms that limit some processing to a subset of incoming stimuli. Attentional mechanisms shape what we see and what we can act upon. They allow for concurrent selection of some (preferably, relevant) information and inhibition of other information. In order to have a more concrete specification of the mechanism underlying visual attention and the binding of features, a number of computational models have been proposed aiming to explain psychophysical findings. In general, all models postulate the existence of a saliency or priority map for registering the potentially interesting areas of the retinal input, and a gating mechanism for reducing the amount of incoming visual information, so that the limited computational resources of the brain can handle it. An example theory that is being extensively tested behaviorally and physiologically is the hypothesis of a bottom-up saliency map in the primary visual cortex. Computational neuroscience provides a mathematical framework for studying the mechanisms involved in brain function and allows complete simulation and prediction of neuropsychological syndromes. =Cognition, discrimination, and learning= Computational modeling of higher cognitive functions has only recently begun. Experimental data comes primarily from single-unit recording in primates. The frontal lobe and parietal lobe function as integrators of information from multiple sensory modalities. There are some tentative ideas regarding how simple mutually inhibitory functional circuits in these areas may carry out biologically relevant computation. The brain seems to be able to discriminate and adapt particularly well in certain contexts. For instance, human beings seem to have an enormous capacity for memorizing and recognizing faces. One of the key goals of computational neuroscience is to dissect how biological systems carry out these complex computations efficiently and potentially replicate these processes in building intelligent machines. The brain's large- scale organizational principles are illuminated by many fields, including biology, psychology, and clinical practice. Integrative neuroscience attempts to consolidate these observations through unified descriptive models and databases of behavioral measures and recordings. These are the bases for some quantitative modeling of large-scale brain activity. The Computational Representational Understanding of Mind (CRUM) is another attempt at modeling human cognition through simulated processes like acquired rule-based systems in decision making and the manipulation of visual representations in decision making. =Consciousness= One of the ultimate goals of psychology/neuroscience is to be able to explain the everyday experience of conscious life. Francis Crick, Giulio Tononi and Christof Koch made some attempts to formulate consistent frameworks for future work in neural correlates of consciousness (NCC), though much of the work in this field remains speculative. Specifically, Crick cautioned the field of neuroscience to not approach topics that are traditionally left to philosophy and religion. =Computational clinical neuroscience= Computational clinical neuroscience is a field that brings together experts in neuroscience, neurology, psychiatry, decision sciences and computational modeling to quantitatively define and investigate problems in neurological and psychiatric diseases, and to train scientists and clinicians that wish to apply these models to diagnosis and treatment.

Lipovans or Lippovans (, , , ) are Old Believers, mostly of Russian ethnic origin, who settled in Romania in the Moldavian Principality, and in the regions of Dobruja and Eastern Muntenia. According to the Romanian census of 2002, there are a total of 35,791 Lipovans in Romania, of whom 21,623 live in Dobruja. Name The origin of the name of the Lipovans is not known exactly , but it may come from the linden trees (\\"Lipa\\" or \\"Липа\\" in Russian) of the area they populate bordering the Wild Fields. However, one story claims the name derives from the name \\"Filipp\\" (1672-1742) which is alleged to have been the true name of the son of Nikita Pustosvyat (d.1683) who according to the same rather dubious legend led the group of dissenters who emigrated to what is now Romania, his adepts being named Filippovtsy which became Lipovtsi and finally Lippovane.Victor Vascenco, \\"Melchisedec şi lipovenii\\" , Romanoslavica (University of Bucharest), XLII, p. 133 Another story derives it from \\"Filippovka\\", a holiday name dedicated to Saint Philip of Moscow. History The Lipovans emigrated from Russia in the 18th century, as dissenters from the main Russian Orthodox Church. They settled along the Prut River in Moldavia and in the Danube Delta. They have maintained strong religious traditions which predate the reforms of the Russian Orthodox Church undertaken during the rule of Patriarch Nikon. When the Patriarch made changes to worship in 1652, some believers carried on worshipping in the \\"old way\\". In that sense, they continued to speak Old Russian, to cross themselves with two fingers instead of three, and to keep their beards. The Russian government and the Orthodox Church persecuted them, and as a result some committed suicide by burning themselves (self-burning: soshigateli), with many others being forced to emigrate. In 1876, the Lipovans were joined by members of the Skoptsy sect, who also emigrated to Romania to escape persecution. Lipovans were considered to be schismatic by the Russian Orthodox Church, although relations have improved recently. (See main article on Old Believers.) Population Lipovan fisherman in the Danube Delta Lipovans in Vylkove, Ukraine The main centre of Lipovan community in Ukraine is the town of Vylkove, which has its own church, St Nicholas. In order to construct their homes, the Lipovans create islets of dry land by digging mud out from trenches and making a series of canals. The house walls are made of reed and mud, and thatching is standard for the roofing. Because of the characteristics of these materials, the buildings have a tendency to sink into the mud and need to be rebuilt every few years. The population is popularly known as having red hair.http://icc-online.arte- ct.ro/vol_01/10.pdf For details on the Lipovans in Bulgaria, see Russians in Bulgaria.

Radama's rule, although brief, was a pivotal period in the history of the Kingdom of Madagascar. Under the unyielding and often harsh 33-year rule of his mother, Queen Ranavalona I, Madagascar had successfully preserved its cultural and political independence from European colonial designs. Rejecting the queen's policy of isolationism and persecution of Christians, Radama II permitted religious freedom and re-opened Madagascar to European influence. Under the terms of the Lambert Charter, which Radama secretly contracted in 1855 with French entrepreneur Joseph-François Lambert while Ranavalona still ruled, the French were awarded exclusive rights to the exploitation of large tracts of valuable land and other lucrative resources and projects. This agreement, which was later revoked by Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony, was key to establishing France's claim over Madagascar as a protectorate and, in 1896, as a colony. The dramatic contrast between Ranavalona's isolationism and her son's pro-European stance represented an abrupt reversal of policy that threatened the traditional sociopolitical order. Radama's absolutism in pursuing dramatic reforms in disregard of the advice of his ministers ultimately turned them against him. In a coup led by his prime minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, Radama II was strangled on May 12, 1863. His wife Rabodo, who took the throne name Rasoherina, was allowed by the ministers to succeed her husband on the condition that she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally, but rather in concert with the Hova (the class of free citizens) as represented by the position of prime minister. The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that his body had been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in Ilafy. However, there soon emerged rumors – believed by prominent foreigners Jean Laborde and William Ellis – that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne. A strong case has since been made on the basis of significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in anonymity near Lake Kinkony in the northwestern part of the island.  Upbringing and early years  Radama II was born Prince Rakoto (Rakotosehenondradama) on September 23, 1829 in the Imasoandro building on the compound of the Rova of Antananarivo. He was officially recognized as the son of King Radama I and his widow Queen Ranavalona I, although the king had died more than nine months before the prince's birth. He was likely fathered by a lover of his mother, Andriamihaja, a progressive young officer of the Merina army who the queen may have been tricked into putting to death by conservative ministers at court. After his mother succeeded Radama I on the throne, she instituted an increasingly regressive regime that attempted to restore traditional values and contain or eliminate westernization. The prince, however, who had been highly influenced by the French adviser to the queen, Joseph-François Lambert, was favorably impressed by European culture, knowledge and its state of economic, political and technological development, and was troubled by some of the socially repressive policies pursued by Ranavalona I. According to a British account, the French played on this sympathy in 1855 by pressuring Prince Rakoto into signing a request for French aid that would have enabled France to establish control over Madagascar had the true nature of the letter and its signing not been uncovered by Rakoto and his British contacts. An alternate explanation was offered by Lambert, who maintained that the prince had knowingly supported the attempt to put an end to his mother's harsh policies, and was a willing collaborator in a failed 1857 plot to remove her from the throne. Prior to Queen Ranavalona's death, the conservative and progressive factions within the Merina court waged a tactical power struggle to secure a successor favorable to their own political agenda. The conservative faction favored Ramboasalama, the son of the Queen's sister, while the Queen's prime minister, Rainivoninahitriniony and head of the army, Rainilaiarivony, brothers and progressives, supported Radama II. The latter successfully obtained key strategic allies within the court that enabled Radama to seize the throne without violence following his mother's death. Ramboasalama was obliged to swear a public oath of allegiance to Radama, and was later sent into exile in the highland village of Ambohimirimo where he died in April 1862.  Reign  Prince Rakoto acceded to the throne on August 16, 1861 upon the natural death of his mother, Queen Ranavalona I, assuming the throne name Radama II. His coronation ceremony was held the following year on September 23, 1862. Once upon the throne, he immediately initiated a rapid and dramatic reversal of many of his mother's traditionalist policies. He reopened the country to foreign powers and concluded treaties of friendship with Britain and France. The Lambert Charter opened up business possibilities for French investors. Freedom of religion was declared, persecution of Christians ceased, missionaries returned to the island and their schools were reopened. Radama abolished the traditional trial by ordeal of tangena, in which the guilt or innocence of an accused person was determined based on the outcome of consuming the poison of the tangena nut, and inhabitants of Antananarivo were permitted to raise swine within the city walls, a practice previously forbidden by a fady (taboo) forbidding them from being kept near the royal talismans (sampy). The sampy were dispersed to the sacred villages where they had originated under 16th-century Merina king Ralambo and other early monarchs. Significantly, Radama freed numerous political prisoners captured under Ranavalona I during provincial wars of subjugation and offered repatriation of confiscated property. This pardon was reciprocated by many of the beneficiary ethnic groups around the island, and good will between the coasts and central administration at Antananarivo improved significantly. These changes, and the king himself, were unequivocally praised by Madagascar's European partners: The reaction within Imerina was less one- sided. The abrupt and dramatic policy changes pursued by the progressive king both alienated and disfranchised the established conservative factions among the andriana (nobles) and Hova (freemen) at court. Especially controversial were the special privileges accorded to Joseph-François Lambert and his partners under the Lambert Charter, including the exclusive implementation of public works projects (felling trees, making roads, building canals etc.), control over minting coinage, lucrative mining rights and more as part of the purview of Lambert's proposed Compagnie de Madagascar (French Madagascar Company). The citizens' concern stemmed primarily from clauses in the agreement that would have permitted Lambert's company to become permanent owners of Malagasy lands. Until this point, land in Madagascar, which was viewed by the populace as the sacred ground of the ancestors, could only ever be temporarily possessed by foreigners until their death, at which point the land would revert to the crown. The threat of permanently losing any part of sacred Malagasy soil to foreigners was deeply troubling.  Assassination plot  King Radama II walks with his wife Rabodo, who would become Queen Rasoherina after the coup against her husband. The legalization of dueling was ultimately the issue that brought to a head the tension between King Radama II's entourage (mostly friends and some established political figures, known collectively as the menamaso or \\"red-eyes\\") and representatives of the opposition led by Radama's prime minister Rainivoninahitriniony. On May 7, 1863, Radama II announced his intention to allow disputes to be settled by a duel, much to the disapproval of many of his advisers at court who feared the practice would lead to anarchy. The prime minister prevented the law from being publicly declared at the Zoma (Friday) market the following day. Friday afternoon, the prime minister's younger brother, Rainilaiarivony, who was head of the army, called several thousand troops into the city to besiege a number of the menamaso and members of the royal family at the Rova palace compound, and by Saturday morning the decision had been made and carried out to execute eleven of the menamaso and other key political figures who had counseled Radama to legalize dueling. On Sunday, May 10, Rainivoninahitriniony demanded that Radama hand over the menamaso he was sheltering in the palace, which he refused to do until the prime minister agreed to spare their lives; they were handed over but by Monday morning had all been speared to death. The drama ended on Tuesday morning, May 12, 1863, when a group of officers and soldiers forced their way into the Rova and seized the king. His wife, Queen Rabodo, pleaded for his life to be spared and attempted to stop them but was forcibly removed. The soldiers threw a lamba over Radama's head and strangled him with a silk sash until he was believed to be dead, thereby avoiding the shedding of royal blood as was the custom for royal executions in Imerina. The nobles informed Rabodo that she would have their support as queen on the condition that she would accept to abide by certain articles that would form a new contract between rulers and ruled in Madagascar: Rabodo agreed to these conditions. The next morning, it was publicly announced in the marketplace that Radama had taken his own life due to grief over the deaths of his compatriots the menamaso and that Rabodo would succeed him as Queen Rasoherina. To cement the new power-sharing agreement between the ruler, the nobles and the heads of the people, a political marriage was contracted between the queen and Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, who had been instrumental in her first husband's death. Radama's name was struck from the list of kings and it was declared illegal to mourn his death.  Rumors of survival  Following Radama II's apparent death, rumors spread that he had only been rendered unconscious by the attempt on his life and had revived as his body was being transported to Ilafy for interment in his designated tomb. French historian Delval presents evidence that supports a scenario wherein the group tasked with carrying Radama's body to Ilafy became frightened as the king began to revive, prompting them to abandon the body and then falsely maintain that they had completed their task to place him in the tomb. Within months after his reported death, rumors began circulating that Radama was alive, residing on the west coast of the island and was amassing supporters for a political comeback. The rumors persisted to the point of causing political turmoil in Antananarivo. These claims may have had some substance judging by the actions of others. Prominent Christian missionaries outside the capital made extensive efforts to visit and support Radama but seemingly never succeeded. Traditionalist factions within the government were concerned enough by the rumors to have put to death sixteen of his supporters, as well as fining hundreds of others. According to evidence in Delval's study, Radama may indeed have survived and, failing to regain the throne, lived to old age as an ordinary citizen in the north of the island. With the apparent murder of Radama II, the power of the Merina monarchs was broken. Subsequent monarchs were controlled by influential Hova, particularly Rainilaiarivony, who became prime minister after his brother and successively married all three remaining queens of the monarchy: Rasoherina, Ranavalona II and Ranavalona III.

Early years Rasoherina, niece of Queen Ranavalona I, was born Princess Rabodozanakandriana in 1814, the daughter of Prince Andriantsalamanandriana, of Ambohitraina and Princess Rafaramanjaka (Ramirahavavy). As a young woman, she married Raharolahy (Raharola), a successful statesman in his own right who received 15 state honors and served as Secretary to the Embassy to Great Britain (1836–37), Second Minister for Foreign Affairs in French matters (1862), Minister for the Interior (1862–64), Counselor of Government (1864–65) and Governor of Toamasina (1865). The couple divorced in 1847 and that same year she was married to Ranavalona's son and heir, Rakoto. When he succeeded his mother in 1861 as King Radama II, she was crowned with him as queen consort. Accession to the throne Portrait of Queen Rasoherina Rasoherina acted as queen consort for only two years before her husband's political decisions succeeded in displeasing his ministers to such an extent that a coup was organized in which Radama II was believed assassinated. A study conducted in the 1960s provides evidence that Radama in fact survived the assassination attempt and lived to old age as a regular citizen outside the capital, although rumors to this end were never proven to be true at the time, and the evolution of life at court pursued its course as if Radama had died. The day of his believed death in 1863, the council of Hova government officials responsible for organizing the coup, headed by the brothers Rainivoninahitriniony and Rainilaiarivony, invited Rabodo to succeed to the throne on the condition that she sign a contract stipulating conditions that in effect created a constitutional monarchy placing the real ruling power in the hands of the Prime Minister.Cousins, William Edward. Madagascar of to- day: A sketch of the island, with chapters on its past. The Religious Tract Society, 1895. These conditions included the suppression of tangena (a traditional trial by ordeal) as well as the monarchy's defense of freedom of religion. Rabodo was crowned on 13 May 1863 under the throne name of Rasoherina.Frédéric Randriamamonjy, Tantaran'i Madagasikara Isam-Paritra (The history of Madagascar by Region), pages 529 – 534. Reign The real power of the kingdom at the beginning of Rasoherina's reign was Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, instigator of the coup against her husband. The Prime Minister entered into a political marriage with Rasoherina a few weeks after the crowning. Rainivoninahitriniony effectively operated unhindered in his running of state affairs at court where the conservative faction empowered under Ranavalona I was still active under the leadership of her former prime minister, Rainijohary. However, Rainivoninahitriniony's progressives formed a majority in the Queen's Council and their advocacy for a moderately pro- European policy of modernization won out over the reversal of the policies of Radama II that were demanded by Rainijohary's conservatives.Ade Ajayi, J.F.Africa in the nineteenth century until the 1880s. UNESCO, 1989. However, Rainivoninahitriniony became increasingly despotic and exhibited habitual drunkenness and frequent violence as his power grew, reportedly threatening Queen Rasoherina at knife point on several occasions.De La Vaissière, Camille. Histoire de Madagascar: ses habitants et ses missionnaires, Volume 1. One year after taking the throne, Rasoherina deposed Rainivoninahitriniony, appointed his younger brother Rainilaiarivony as prime minister in his stead and contracted a political marriage with him in turn.Laidler, Keith.

The controversial Lambert Charter enacted by Radama II was declared void, much to the displeasure of France; a sum of 240,000 ariary (~ 1,200,000 French francs) was paid to France in reparations for the breach of this lucrative trade agreement.Ralibera, Daniel. Madagascar et le christianisme. Karthala Editions, 1993. On 27 June 1865, she signed a treaty with the United Kingdom giving British citizens the right to rent land and property on the island and to have a resident ambassador. On 14 February 1867, she signed a treaty with the United States of America that limited the importation of weapons and the export of cattle. A treaty with France was under consideration during her reign but was not signed into effect until after her death and the succession of Ranavalona II to the throne. Succession conspiracy and death The body of Queen Rasoherina was interred in her tomb at the Rova of Antananarivo. In the final days of the queen's life, a succession conspiracy came to light that would have removed Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony from power and ensured the succession of a prince named Rasata to the throne upon Rasoherina's death. On Friday, 27 March 1868, at two in the afternoon, a massive crowd armed with guns and swords attempted to storm the Rova of Antananarivo, residence of Queen Rasoherina. Disgraced former Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony was believed to be the chief instigator of the action as he would have re-established himself as Prime Minister and ruled through young Rasata's puppet government. The rebel group successfully captured a number of key figures, including the head of the Queen's Guard; a group of guards, however, managed to escape and raced to notify Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony who was visiting Ambohimanga where Queen Rasoherina was gravely ill from dysentery. The Prime Minister gave the order to arrest the conspirators, several of whom were promptly captured upon the soldiers' return to the city. At five in the evening, Rasoherina delivered a public address, asking those favorable to her rule to walk with her through the capital; a massive crowd paraded with her through the city, demonstrating their support for her continued authority. The queen then delivered a speech at Andohalo ordering the public to turn in any known conspirators to bring them to justice, before returning to the Rova to reassume her royal duties. The windows along the route to the palace were reportedly all ordered shut, either to protect the Queen from projectiles or to keep the nobles inhabiting the upper town from viewing the advanced state of her infirmity. The queen died four days later, on 1 April 1868. On her deathbed, she was received into the Roman Catholic Church and conferred the care of her two orphaned children, Ratahiry and Rasoaveromanana, to her first cousin and successor, Ramoma, another of Radama II's wives, who would succeed her and take the throne name Ranavalona II.

She is best remembered for Christianizing the royal court during her reign.  Early life  Ranavalona II was born Princess Ramoma in 1829 at Ambatomanoina, near Antananarivo in the central highlands to Prince Razakaratrimo and his wife Princess Rafarasoa Ramasindrazana. As a young woman she, like her cousin Rasoherina, was married to King Radama II and was widowed upon his assassination in the nobles' coup of 1863. The prime minister at the time, Rainivoninahitriniony, played a major role in the assassination plot and public condemnation of the action forced him from his post. The position of prime minister was then filled by his younger brother Rainilaiarivony, who married Queen Rasoherina and then, upon her death, helped to designate Ranavalona II the next monarch of Madagascar and consequently married her to retain his position. During her years at court, young Ramoma was tutored by Protestant missionaries who greatly influenced her religious and political views. She became increasingly favorable toward the beliefs of the Christian religion.  Reign  Portrait of Ranavalona II, which once hung at the Rova of Antananarivo. Ranavalona II succeeded to the throne upon the death of Queen Rasoherina on April 1, 1868. On 21 February 1869, she entered into a political marriage with her prime minister, Rainilaiarivony, in a public ceremony at Andohalo wherein the court officially underwent conversion to Christianity. This conversion was effected to bring the increasingly powerful Protestant faction under the influence of the royal court. Declaring Madagascar a Christian nation, Ranavalona had the traditional royal talismans (sampy) burned in a bonfire in September 1869 and replaced their authority with that of the Bible. Under her rule the problem of deforestation was considered. The queen authorized construction using brick and other durable materials within the walls of Antananarivo (previously forbidden by King Andrianampoinimerina). She also banned the traditional practice of tavy (swidden, slash-and-burn agriculture), charcoal making and construction of houses within forests. A European visitor to the court of Ranavalona II in 1873 described the queen in the following terms: \\"I should think the queen was about 45 years of age, with a dark olive complexion, and a face full of kindness and benevolence. She was very queenly, and dressed in a gray shot-silk dress, and a silk lamba fell negligently from her shoulders. Her hair was black, and beautifully arranged; 'crown she did not wear', but from the hair at the top of her head there depended the long fine gold chain ending in a gold tassel, which only the queen can wear.\\"  Death and succession  Ranavalona II died in 1883 and was buried in Ambohimanga. In a bid to desacralize the holy city, in 1897 the French colonial authority disinterred her remains along with those of other monarchs buried in Ambohimanga and transferred them to the tombs on the compound of the Rova of Antananarivo, where her bones were interred in the tomb of Queen Rasoherina. She was succeeded by Queen Ranavalona III, the last monarch of the kingdom.

The term Soulseek might refer to (1) one of the two networks, or (2) one of the three official user client interfaces.Other non Soulseek clients may still be able to access the network Soulseek is used mostly to exchange music, although users are able to share a variety of files. Soulseek was created by Nir Arbel,Thomas Mennecke: Interview with Nir Arbel Slyck.com December 26, 2003 an Israeli programmer from Safed. Two independent networks have made up Soulseek since 2006, both run by the same management. The older and now the less used one is accessed by Soulseek client 156; the newer network and one with greatest usage is accessed by Soulseek client 157 (Windows only) or SoulseekQt (Microsoft Windows, macOS, or Linux platforms).SoulseekQt and 157 access one network, and 156 another. Effectively, the clients access separate networks, with separate userbases that do not communicate with each other. However both networks can be run simultaneously on the same (Windows) computer. The newer SoulseekQt (multi-OS) interface operates on the 157 network (albeit with somewhat different functionality compared to the old Windows 157 client). There are reportedly five times more users on the network accessed by clients 157/Qt than 156 as of August 2011. New developments are solely on the SoulseekQt client interface. Work on Client 157 (Windows only) stopped in 2008. SoulseekQt has somewhat different functionality compared to the 157 client interface.  Key features  = Content = As a peer to peer (P2P) file sharing program, the accessible content is determined by the users of the Soulseek client, and what files they choose to share. The network has historically had a diverse mix of music, including underground and independent artists, unreleased music, such as demos and mixtapes, bootlegs, live tracks, and live DJ sets, but releases from major and independent labels can also be found. = Central server = Soulseek depends on a pair of central servers. One server supports the original client and network Version 156, with the other supporting the newer network (functioning with clients 157 and Qt). for more on the Soulseek Protocol While these central servers are key to coordinating searches and hosting chat rooms, they do not actually play a part in the transfer of files between users, which takes place directly between the users concerned. (See Single Source Downloads below). = Searching = Users can search for items; the results returned being a list of files whose names match the search term used.Official website slsknet.org Searches may be explicit or may use wildcards/patterns or terms to be excluded. For example, searching for blue suede -shoes will return a list of files whose names containing the strings blue and suede, but files containing the string shoes in their names will be excluded. A feature specific to the Soulseek search engine is the inclusion of the folder names and file paths in the search list. This allows users to search by folder name. For example, typing in experimental will return all the files that are contained in folders having that name, providing quick access to bands and albums in a determined musical genre. The list of search results shows details, such as the full name and path of the file, its size, the user who is hosting the file, together with that users' average transfer rate, and in the case of mp3 files, brief details about the encoded track itself, such as bit rate, length, etc. The resulting search list may then be sorted in a variety of ways and individual files (or folders) chosen for download. The Soulseek protocol search algorithms are not published, as those algorithms run on the server. = Single source (one-to- one) downloads = Soulseek does not support multi-source downloading or \\"swarming\\" like other post-Napster clients, and must fetch a requested file from a single source. (By contrast, swarming allows a requested file to be sourced from a number of users who have that file, thus pieces of the file may be downloaded concurrently from a number of sources, typically giving improved performance.) = Banning = All Soulseek clients contain a ban feature whereby selected users may be banned from requesting files. This is in response to users who might be free-riding (i.e. taking files from others without sharing any files themselves) or who might be causing a nuisance for other reasons, such as a personal argument through the chat facilities or just taking up a user's bandwidth by downloading too many files, or simply on the whim of the banning user. Banning can be a contentious subject, and was the subject of much discussion in the user forums particularly in the early days. Users with download privileges can still be banned. = Album downloads = While Soulseek, like other P2P clients, allows a user to download individual files from another by selecting each one from a list of search results, a Download Containing Folder option simplifies the downloading of entire albums. For example, a user who wishes to facilitate the distribution of an entire album may place all tracks relating to the album together in a folder on the host PC, and the entire contents of that folder (i.e. all the album's track files) can then be downloaded automatically one after the other using this one command. = File transfer monitoring = The Soulseek client features two file transfer monitoring windows where the progress of files being uploaded and downloaded can be monitored and controlled. = User profiles = Users may complete a profile which contains basic free-form text information (e.g. basic information about themselves or their 'file transfer rules') together with a list of things they like, a list of things they dislike, and optionally an image file. These items may then be viewed by other users when selecting the username from a list of members in a chat room or a list of files returned by a search. The list of items a user likes may also be used to obtain global rankings for that item in the Soulseek community or to obtain recommendations from other users who have the same items in their list of things they like. = Wishlists = The Soulseek 156, 157 and Qt clients provide a \\"wishlist\\" feature which functions like a stored search. Search terms are input as entries in a wishlist and each wishlist entry is then periodically executed as a search automatically by the client software, returning results as appropriate. = Privileges = While the Soulseek software is free, a donation scheme exists to support the programming effort and cost of maintaining the servers. In return for donations, users are granted the privilege of being able to jump ahead of non-donating users in a queue when downloading files (but only if the files are not shared over a local area network).  Support forums and blog  Like numerous other software titles, Soulseek has a set of forums where users may seek help on a variety of topics, such as technical aspects of using the software. Separate forums now support clients 156 and 157, and Qt. The first blog was created in the latter part of 2003.  Financing  Soulseek is entirely financed by donations, with no advertising or user fees. Nir Arbel writes, as of July 1, 2008:  Copyright issues  Soulseek claims to be against copyright violation and that the purpose of their service is to promote unsigned artists. This is a quote from their homepage: Soulseek was taken to court in 2008 by two French music industry groups. The groups alleged that Soulseek is designed to permit unauthorized access to copyrighted works.\\"Music Industry takes Soulseek to court\\", Torrentfreak  History  The original Soulseek user base around 2000 was composed mostly of members of the IDM mailing list,IDM Mailing List – Hosted by Hyperreal.org and most of the music first found on Soulseek was underground electronic music or music created by the users themselves. Aided by Soulseek users, the developer Nir Arbel released new versions of the client very frequently, in response to user requests for new features or bug fixes. There is no known published usage data. Soulseek got a first boost in 2001 when Napster was closed down and then a second boost in 2002 when the site Audiogalaxy was closed down. Nir Arbel stated in an interview published December 26, 2003 that there were, at that time, over a million registered usernames and that 80,000–100,000 users log on during peak hours. The increase in Soulseek users after the shutdown of Audiogalaxy was plainly evident from a before-and-after comparison of chat room populations. Before the shutdown of its competitor, Soulseek's most-joined chat rooms averaged 50 or so people. After the shutdown, the population of these chat rooms increased to 100 or more. Soulseek is more of a community than a simple file sharing client. In Soulseek, users can connect with other users with similar music tastes to share files and to chat. Users even have the ability to create their own chat rooms and invite other users with similar tastes to discuss their favorite music. Many musicians from the electronic scene are themselves too part of this Soulseek community. In summer 2004, Soulseek users from all the world met in Augsburg, Germany. Every year since then, that meeting still takes place at a digital arts festival called Lab30 (30 being the street number of the Abraxas Theater) in Augsburg, Germany, organized by longtime Soulseek user Manfred Genther and other Augsburg locals. This festival focuses on showcasing digital musicians, digital artists, and netlabels from all over the world. Many Soulseek artists have performed at the festival, and a large number of them have performed live for the very first time there. Lab30 has steadily grown in size since the first event and continues to be a meeting place for the musicians and users of Soulseek. Attendees usually come from all over Europe and the United States. Lab30 is a well known event in Augsburg and widely supported and cherished by the Augsburg music and art scene. = Soulseek Records = Many of the original Soulseek users are also music producers, and Soulseek Records (not to be confused with \\"SLSK Records\\") was formed in 2002. = Versions = The first release was 139, which ran for about 12 months from 2002–03. Following a change in servers, a new version was released to coincide with this event. Whilst the main interface has largely remained unchanged since its inception, additional features such as the chat room 'ticker' were introduced into the 156 version. Version 156 first appeared in 2005.Official website See SLSK A second 'test' version of the server, version 157, was set up shortly afterwards, which became the primary client in 2008. Since July 6, 2008, there have been two versions of the Soulseek client, with entirely different users, user groups, and files. The older version, v.156 is progressively being wound down, but still operates as of August 2011, albeit with few users. Users are not obligated to upgrade, and new users may still inadvertently download the 156 client. The 157 \\"test\\" network has been around since 2005, to circumvent poor search capability on the 156 client. The v.157 test 12c was released in November 2007. All recent versions have several bugs which can hang or cause the system to stop searching or downloading. The client SoulseekQT Public Build 1 was released in 04/19/2011. For the older clients (156 and 157) no official client was developed for non-Windows operating systems, but a number of unofficial third-party clients existed at the time. Development of third-party clients was discouraged (but not prohibited), as coding errors or explicit circumvention of network rules in third-party clients had, at times, a drastic negative impact on the Soulseek network. = Alternative Clients = Nicotine+ is an actively maintained fork of the now defunct Nicotine client. Nicotine+ runs under GNU/Linux and Windows. It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers with its source hosted on GitHub. It uses Gtk+ 3, Python 3, and supports UPnP. Stable and unstable packages are available for Ubuntu. Nicotine+ is also available as a Flatpak, as of release version 2.0.0 Nicotine+'s defunct predecessor Nicotine also ran on all Unix-based systems, such as Mac OS X, and on Microsoft Windows. It is in turn based on the original PySoulSeek project. It may still be available from some package distributors on GNU/Linux-based systems. Other systems PySoulSeek was a Soulseek client written in Python that runs under Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris and other Unix-based operating systems. PySoulSeek runs under Mac OS X but with some difficulty. GoSeek is a Soulseek client for Android devices. It will not run on Android Nougat or newer versions. MewSeek was originally iSlsk, a Soulseek client for iPod Touch and iPhone clients running jailbroken versions of iOS. MewSeek no longer supports Soulseek. Clients for Mac OS X included Soulseex (ssX) and iSoul. iSoul was based on an earlier client called Solarseek.

It stretches for , running from Minehead in Somerset, along the coasts of Devon and Cornwall, to Poole Harbour in Dorset. Because it rises and falls with every river mouth, it is also one of the more challenging trails. The total height climbed has been calculated to be 114,931 ft (35,031 m), almost four times the height of Mount Everest. It has been voted 'Britain's Best Walking route' twice in a row by readers of the Ramblers Walk magazine, and regularly features in lists of the world's best walks. The final section of the path was designated as a National Trail in 1978. Many of the landscapes which the South West Coast Path crosses have special status, either as a national park or one of the heritage coasts. The path passes through two World Heritage Sites: the Dorset and East Devon Coast, known as the Jurassic Coast, was designated in 2001, and the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape in 2007. In the 1990s it was thought that the path brought £150 million into the area each year, but new research in 2003 indicated that it generated around £300 million a year in total, which could support more than 7,500 jobs. This research also recorded that 27.6% of visitors to the region came because of the Path, and they spent £136 million in a year. Local people took 23 million walks on the Path and spent a further £116 million, and other visitors contributed the remainder. A further study in 2005 estimated this figure to have risen to around £300 million. Following investment through the Rural Development Programme for England, more detailed research was undertaken in 2012, and this found the annual spend by walkers to have risen to £439 million which sustains 9771 full-time equivalent jobs History of the path The path originated as a route for the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They needed to be able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast. The path is a designated National Trail, largely funded by Natural England. It was created in stages, with its final section, Somerset and North Devon, opening in 1978. It is maintained by a dedicated South West Coast Path Team. The South West Coast Path Association, a registered charity, exists to support the interests of users of the path. The Association was formed in 1973 and since then it has campaigned for improvements to the path and undertakes considerable fundraising to help care for and improve the path. Its services include accommodation guides and completion certificates. Route description Map of the South West Coast Path South West Coast Path, stone sign near Studland The route is described here anticlockwise, from Minehead to Poole. The distance and total ascent between any two points, in either direction, can be obtained from The South West Coast Path Association Distance Reckoner. A survey carried out in 1999 and 2000 found that at that time the path had 2,473 signposts or waymarks, and included 302 bridges, 921 stiles, and 26,719 steps. In practice, any such calculation is soon out of date because of path diversions due to landslips or access changes. Many walkers take about eight weeks to complete the path, often dividing this into sections walked over several years. In contrast, a team of six Royal Marines, taking turns in pairs to run two-hour sections, completed the path in six days in 2004 and in 2012 a runner ran the entire path in 16 days, 9 hours and 57 minutes. New records for completing the path were set on 11 May 2013, when two runners completed the trail in 14 days, 14 hours and 45 minutes and 23 April 2015, when a runner completed the trail in 14 days, 8 hours and 2 minutes. This record was however quickly broken by Mark Berry, who ran it in 11 days, 8 hours and 15 minutes. On 24 May 2016 outdoor journalist and GB ultra runner Damian Hall set a new fastest known time of 10 days, 15 hours and 18 minutes. =Somerset= Sculpture at the start of the path in Minehead The South West Coast Path starts from the western side of Minehead, in Somerset, at a marker erected in 2001 and partly paid for by the South West Coast Path Association. The path follows the waterfront past the harbour to Culver Cliff before climbing up on a zigzag path through woodland. Entering the Exmoor National Park, it cuts inland past North Hill, Selworthy Beacon and Bossington Hill before regaining the cliff top at Hurlestone Point. After passing through Bossington it follows the beach to Porlock Weir and connects with the Coleridge Way. The scenery of rocky headlands, ravines, waterfalls and towering cliffs gained the Exmoor coast recognition as a Heritage Coast in 1991. The Exmoor Coastal Heaths have been recognised as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the diversity of species present. The path passes the smallest parish church in England, Culbone Church, in Culbone. The path crosses the county boundary into Devon, a few hundred yards north of the National Park Centre at County Gate. =North Devon= The next big headland is Foreland Point, after which the path comes to Lynmouth with the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway linking it with Lynton on the hill above. At Lynmouth the path intersects with the Two Moors Way. The river here suffered a catastrophic flood in the 1950s. Beyond Lynton the path passes through the Valley of Rocks, known for its herd of goats, then Duty Point and Lee Bay, then Crock Point and Woody Bay. After Highveer Rocks the path crosses the small River Heddon then skirts Trentishoe Down and Holdstone Down and climbs Great Hangman. At this is the highest point on the path. With a cliff face of , it is described as the highest cliff on mainland Britain. The path now leaves the Exmoor National Park and enters the village of Combe Martin, which claims to have the longest village street in England (two miles ()). The South West Coast Path passes along the cliffs (seen in the distance) at Ilfracombe, North Devon. The highest point in this view is Hillsborough (447 feet, 136 metres). Part of Ilfracombe is seen on the right. After rounding Widmouth Head, the path passes 'The Coastguard Cottages' in Hele Bay and enters the seaside resort of Ilfracombe, with its small harbour, surrounded by cliffs. A seasonal foot passenger ferry service runs from the harbour to Lundy Island, and the Balmoral, the Waverley and pleasure boats ply to Porthcawl near Swansea. From Ilfracombe to Bideford the Tarka Trail coincides with the South West Coast Path. Saunton Sands The path leaves Ilfracombe through The Torrs and follows the cliff top past several small bays including Lee Bay before passing Bull Point and the Bull Point Lighthouse, into Rackham Bay. It then rounds Morte Point, passing the nearby village of Mortehoe before turning south to enter the long sandy Morte Bay which includes Woolacombe and Putsborough. Baggy Point divides Morte Bay from Croyde Bay, and the surfing mecca of Croyde and then the much larger Barnstaple or Bideford Bay, which forms part of the North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The wide expanse of Saunton Sands, which takes its name from Saunton, merges into the Braunton Burrows Site of Special Scientific Interest, the largest sand dune system (psammosere) in England and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. It is particularly important ecologically because it includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities, with over 400 vascular plant species. The short turf communities are very rich in lichens and herbs, and the dune slacks are also rich. The many rare plants and animals include 14 with UK Biodiversity Action Plans. From Braunton Burrows the South West Coast Path turns inland following the Braunton Canal to Braunton and then along north bank of the River Taw, following part of the route of the old Ilfracombe Branch Line, past the perimeter of the Royal Marines Base Chivenor towards Barnstaple where the new Barnstaple Western Bypass now forms the closest bridge over the Taw to the sea. After crossing medieval Barnstaple Long Bridge, the path then turns west following the disused Bideford & Instow Railway line along southern bank of the Taw past Fremington Quay and the Fremington Quay Cliffs SSSI to Instow at the joint estuary of the Rivers Taw and Torridge and the Taw-Torridge Estuary (SSSI). The ferry which used to operate at Instow ceased on the retirement of the ferryman in 2007, but since 2013 a revived ferry again runs in summer. The path goes upstream to cross the river by the 13th-century Long Bridge at Bideford, which is the site of the Bideford Railway Heritage Centre and terminus of the North Devon Railway. The path continues north beside the Torridge Estuary, in places following the route of the Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway, past Northam to Appledore and around the promontory past the Shell middens and a submerged forest, that dates from the Mesolithic period, off the pebble ridge to Westward Ho! (this is the only placename in the UK which includes an exclamation mark). The path then follows the coast around Clovelly Bay where several small villages including Abbotsham lie inland, because of the cliffs. The path passes the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Peppercombe Castle and the village of Bucks Mills. Clovelly itself is a historic village with a small natural harbour. The path continues past the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Windbury Head to Hartland Point and Hartland Quay. Hartland Point features a lighthouse and radar tower, and marks the western limit (on the English side) of the Bristol Channel with the Atlantic Ocean to the west. There is a winter helicopter service from Hartland Point to Lundy, which is visible from many points along the path between Welcombe and the Cornish border. =North Cornwall= The Haven, the Atlantic Ocean and the beach at Bude The path crosses into Cornwall at Marsland Mouth and continues south-westwards along this rocky coast, past Morwenstow then Higher and Lower Sharpnose Points. Beyond Sandy Mouth, the walking becomes easier through Bude, a surfing resort, and along Widemouth Bay. Returning to the cliffs, the path continues on to Crackington Haven, past Cambeak and further south (over \\"High Cliff\\", Southern Britain's highest sheer-drop cliff at ), and from there to Boscastle, the scene of flooding in 2004. Tintagel and its castle are associated with the conception of the legendary King Arthur and a 15th-century house that was later used as a post office. The path continues to Trebarwith Strand, Tregardock, then to Port Gaverne, Port Isaac, and Port Quin, three small harbours. Overlooking Port Quin is Doyden Castle, a 19th-century folly. The Rumps, on Pentire Point, North Cornwall, site of Iron Age cliff fortifications The scenery is now less wild, the cliffs less high. Rumps Point has Iron Age defences across its narrow neck but the path heads straight past to Pentire Head then swings eastwards again into Polzeath. The estuary of the River Camel forces a detour away from the sea to Rock and the Black Tor Ferry that takes walkers into Padstow. From Stepper Point the path again runs along low sea cliffs to Trevone and Harlyn Bay then around Trevose Head. From here-—weather permitting-—the coast can be seen from Hartland in Devon to beyond St Ives in the west. The path runs southwards through Constantine Bay to Porthcothan then passes around Park Head to reach Mawgan Porth. An easterly view over Newquay Harbour with some of the surfing beaches in the background The long, sandy Watergate Bay leads to St Columb Porth and Newquay. A rail link with through trains to London and the North of England on summer weekends has helped the town prosper as a seaside resort which is visited by both surfers and clubbers. On the far side of the town, beyond Fistral Beach, lies the River Gannel. There are seasonal ferries to Crantock and a footbridge which is passable at low tide, otherwise there is a detour inland to use the road bridge. The path now skirts Pentire Point West and then Kelsey Head to reach Holywell Bay, another surfing beach. After passing round Penhale and crossing Penhale Sands the path enters Perranporth, then climbs out the other side back onto a stretch of cliffs past Cligga Head to the village of St Agnes. Past St Agnes Head, a breeding ground for kittiwakes, lies the ruins of Tywarnhayle Mine and the inlet at Chapel Porth. Next are the ruins of Wheal Charlotte mine and then Porthtowan village. After passing Nancekuke firing ranges, the path drops into Portreath, once a busy port serving inland tin mines around Redruth. Beyond lies Carvannel Downs with Samphire Island just off the coast, and then the Reskajeage Downs better known locally as the North Cliffs. Beyond the cove at Hell's Mouth, the path runs northwards to pass around Navax Point and Godrevy Point, offshore from which lies Godrevy Island with its lighthouse. =West Cornwall= The SWCP near Lelant looking towards Hayle Towans and Godrevy island Turning into the wide sweep of St Ives Bay, where many walkers drop down onto the sands at low tide, the path follows the line of the sand dunes or Towans as they are known here. This area was used for explosives manufacture for many years,Earl, Bryan (1978). Cornish Explosives. Penzance: The Trevithick Society. . the sand being ideal for absorbing any accidental explosions. The Towans are interrupted by two rivers, the small Red River at the north end, and the larger River Hayle and its estuary towards the south. Although narrow, the estuary is tidal and fast flowing due to the large expanse of mud flats and docks that lie behind the Towans, so the path turns away from St Ives Bay to go round via Hayle. The water is crossed using an old railway bridge and then the old Hayle Railway is followed into the town centre then the A30 road to Griggs Quay where quieter roads bring the Path around to the west side of the tidal mud flats. Views of the birdlife can be had from Carnsew Pool at Hayle and from the area around Lelant Saltings railway station, although the official path is slightly inland on the A3074 road through Lelant village, regaining the coast by crossing golf links to reach the last of the Towans above Porth Kidney Sands. Rising back onto low cliffs, the path rounds Carrack Gladden and enters Carbis Bay, it then follows alongside the St Ives Bay railway line into St Ives; a bustling town favoured by artists since the 19th century, which is home to the Tate St Ives art gallery and the Barbara Hepworth Museum. The path passes the east-facing Porthminster Beach and goes around \\"The Island\\", a headland, to the north- facing Porthmeor Beach. From Mussel Point over Wicca Pool and Porthzennor Cove to Zennor Head and Gurnard's Head beyond The coast now shows the open and ancient landscape of the Penwith district along a series of wild headlands such as Clodgy Point, Hor Point, Pen Enys Point, and Carn Naun Point. The Carracks lie just offshore, locally known as Seal Island (and seals can often be seen close to the shore opposite here), then there lies Zennor Head and Gurnard's Head as the Path leads into Morvah, although the village proper lies inland. Portheras Cove is a relief from the many small rocky bays along this coast but the cliffs then continue beyond the iconic, disused Crowns Mine at Botallack. Near Land's End, the most westerly point in mainland England From Cape Cornwall at St Just, the Path heads southwards to sandy Whitesand Bay and the village of Sennen. At the end of the sands the path turns westwards one last time to reach Land's End. This is the most westerly point of the English mainland. After passing Land's End the path continues further south past Pordenack Point and Mill Bay before turning fully eastward at Gwennap Head. Beyond the tiny village of Porthgwarra lies St Levan. The next bay lies below Porthcurno. It is overlooked by the open-air Minack Theatre and is where the Eastern Cable Company's cable came ashore, the first telegraph link with India. Climbing out of the bay the path passes the precarious Logan Rock. The next village is Penberth, then a series of bays are separated by the headlands of Merthen Point, Boscawen Point, and Tater Du with its lighthouse built in 1965. Lamorna Cove is a favourite with artists such as S. J. \\"Lamorna\\" Birch, who lived there in a small cottage. Then, after rounding Carn Du, the path turns northwards towards Mousehole and Penlee Point. This section of the path follows a road into Newlyn, but a diversion via Paul allows walkers to follow a quieter inland path. Newlyn has a busy fishing harbour and is again favoured by artists, known as the Newlyn School; it merges into Penzance and the path now follows the promenade through the town, passing Penzance railway station and continuing past the railway engine shed along the shore of Mount's Bay with its views of St Michael's Mount. This is an island at high tide but can be reached from Marazion by a causeway at low tide. Wheal Prosper The path now turns south again, passing the village of Perranuthnoe (or Perran) and Perran Sands, then skirting inland across the neck of Cudden Point to Prussia Cove and Bessy's Cove. A larger sandy beach is Praa Sands after which the path climbs up onto a series of cliff tops such as Trewavas Head. This area shows many signs of Cornwall's mining history with abandoned engine houses such as Wheal Prosper and Wheal Trewavas close to the path. After passing through Porthleven the path crosses the shingle bank of Loe Bar with the freshwater Loe Pool behind. At Gunwalloe more cliffs appear, leading to Poldhu Cove overlooked by the radio station on Poldhu Point, then Porth Mellin on Mullion Cove with Mullion Island offshore. Rounding Predannack Head, Vellan Head, and Rill Head (where the Spanish Armada was first sighted on 29 July 1588), the path leads to Kynance Cove and Lizard Point, the lighthouse of which has been visible for some distance. Lizard Point is the most southerly point of the British mainland. =South Cornwall= Falmouth Harbour, National Maritime Museum Cornwall and Pendennis Castle After passing The Lizard the path turns northwards, continuing past Housel Bay and a building used by Guglielmo Marconi for radio experiments, then Bass Point with its Coastguard Station. The Lizard lifeboat station is a sheltered position in Kilcobben Cove. Passing through Cadgwith and across Kennack Sands, the path heads towards Black Head then into Coverack. Once around Lowland Point, The Manacles lie a mile offshore, a reef that has wrecked many ships. The path passes through Porthoustock and Porthallow, then around Nare Point lies Gillan Creek. This can be crossed at very low tide, but most walkers follow the lanes round the head of the creek to reach Dennis Head at the mouth of the Helford River. To cross this wider river means following it inland to Helford where there is a ferry across to Helford Passage on the north bank. Some people take a short cut from Gillan Creek to Helford by a path through Manaccan. After following the river back through Durgan to the open waters beyond Toll Point, the path skirts Falmouth Bay along Maenporth, Swanpool and Gyllyngvase beaches before passing around the headland beneath Pendennis Castle to enter bustling Falmouth. The castle was built, along with its twin at St Mawes, to protect the deep water of Carrick Roads from attack. This natural haven is what made Falmouth such an important harbour, it being the last good shelter for ships heading westwards towards the Atlantic Ocean. The path crosses the harbour on the St Mawes Ferry and then passes St Anthony Head and Zone Point and northwards past the village of Portscatho and around Gerrans Bay. Beyond Nare Head is Portloe in Veryan Bay. The next big headland is Dodman Point after which the coast path resumes its northwards course through Gorran Haven and the fishing harbour at Mevagissey to Pentewan where the once busy dock has silted up with sand. The path then climbs up around Black Head to reach Porthpean and then Charlestown. This was the first harbour to serve the china clay industry around St Austell and has featured in several films as it is home to a heritage fleet of sailing ships. After passing Carlyon Bay the path comes to the much busier china-clay exporting port of Par, where it goes inland of the dock site. After passing through the village the path regains the coast at Par Sands and links with the Saints' Way, a coast-to-coast path across Cornwall, at Polmear. It then follows the cliff tops through Polkerris and around Gribbin Head. From here to Polperro is designated as a heritage coast. Withnoe (Main) Beach portion of Whitsand Bay The path now passes Polridmouth (pronounced 'Pridmouth') and Readymoney Cove to enter Fowey ('Foy'), another busy harbour but this time the deep water quays are situated up river above the town. The River Fowey is crossed on the Polruan ferry, beyond which are some steep cliffs with extensive views. Beyond Lantic Bay lies Pencarrow Head then the larger Lantivet Bay with further cliffs and small coves leading to Polperro, a fishing village which bans cars during the summer. Beyond Polperro lies Talland Bay and Portnadler Bay, with the bird reserve of Looe Island (also known as St George's island) off shore. The path now enters Looe, passing through Hannafore, West Looe then, after crossing the River Looe on a seven-span bridge. The path continues up onto the cliff then heads towards Millendreath then along more cliffs, running past a 60-ft sevenfold labyrinth carved into the turf of the hillside to Seaton, Downderry, and Portwrinkle. The long beach of Whitsand Bay has a fast-rising tide and is a military firing range so the path runs inland behind Tregantle Fort to reach Freathy and Rame Head. Beyond this lies Penlee Point and then the path turns northwards into Plymouth Sound, skirting Cawsand Bay and Mount Edgcumbe Country Park to reach the ferry at Cremyll. Beyond here lies the Hamoaze, the combined estuary of the Tamar and other rivers. =South Devon= Plymouth Hoe from Mount Batten The Cremyll Ferry lands in Devon at Stonehouse, one of the Three Towns that make up the modern city of Plymouth. The path follows roads past Stonehouse Barracks and Millbay Docks to Plymouth Hoe with its views across Plymouth Sound. It then crosses Sutton Harbour by the Mayflower Steps then skirts the hill of Cattedown to cross the River Plym by the Laira Bridge to Plymstock. Passing round the edge of the tidal Hooe Lake, the path regains the countryside above Jennycliff Bay, part of the Plymouth Sound, Shores and Cliffs Site of Special Scientific Interest, and follows the cliffs past Bovisand to Wembury, Wembury Marine Centre. From Wembury the path travels east into the South Hams district to the Warren Point Ferry, across the River Yealm, near Newton Ferrers. The River Erme near Kingston must be forded at Erme Mouth within one hour of low tide. The path then goes past Hillsea Point Rock. The view to the southwest is then over Bigbury Bay past Burgh Island and Hope Cove to the promontory known as Bolt Tail. The next 6 miles (10 km) of cliff top paths from Bolberry Down past Bolt Head and the tidal ria of Kingsbridge Estuary to Prawle Point, belong to the National Trust. The estuary is crossed using the Salcombe Ferry, from Salcombe to East Portlemouth, close to Salcombe Castle and within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The path passes through the Prawle Point and Start Point Site of Special Scientific Interest which is recognised as being an important site for solitary bees and wasps, the rare cuckoo bee Nomada sexfasciata, and the Cirl bunting. Direction sign at Bigbury-on-Sea with Burgh Island in the background The path then continues around Lannacombe Bay to Start Point and its Lighthouse and then through Start Bay along a 3-mile (5 km) shingle causeway between Slapton Sands and the Slapton Ley freshwater lake and nature reserve before entering the estuary of the River Dart and historic port of Dartmouth. From Dartmouth, the route uses either the Lower Ferry or Passenger Ferry to cross the river to Kingswear. Kingswear is the terminus of the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway which follows the River Dart, but the coast path climbs out of the village in the opposite direction to reach Torbay, known as \\"The English Riviera\\". It passes the historic harbour of Brixham and the seaside towns of Goodrington, Paignton, Torquay and Babbacombe. The coast path then passes along the wooded cliffs above Labrador Bay to reach Shaldon and the River Teign. On the Jurassic Coast between Exmouth and Budleigh Salterton Crossing the river by ferry or the long Shaldon Bridge brings walkers to Teignmouth, beyond which the coast path follows the South Devon Railway sea wall to Hole Head where the Parson and Clerk rocks look out to sea. Passing beneath the railway, the path climbs up to the main road, which it follows for a few yards before turning back towards the cliff top (in stormy weather the sea wall is too dangerous and this road must be followed most of the way from Teignmouth). Entering Dawlish along a now by- passed toll road, the coast path descends back to the level of the railway which it follows to Dawlish Warren, although a slightly more landward route is necessary at high tide. Dawlish Warren is a sand spit and nature reserve that lies at the mouth of the River Exe. The route now turns away from the coast and follows the Exe estuary past Cockwood to Starcross where the seasonal Exmouth to Starcross Ferry crosses to Exmouth. The Exe Valley Way continues beyond Starcross towards Exeter, but when the ferry is not running it is possible to catch a train from either Dawlish Warren or Starcross railway stations to Exmouth railway station. South West Coast Path in Torquay On the eastern side of Exmouth, the coast path climbs up onto the High Land of Orcombe. This is the start of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. The next town is Budleigh Salterton, beyond which lies the River Otter. The path then skirts Chiselbury Bay and Ladram Bay towards Sidmouth which sits at the mouth of the River Sid. Access to the beach is via a wooden staircase known as Jacob's ladder. Sidmouth is surrounded by the East Devon AONB. Erosion remains a serious concern east of the mouth of the River Sid. The cliffs have been heavily eroded, threatening cliff top homes and the footpath, which passes along the tops of the cliff, around Lyme Bay, avoiding The Undercliff towards Branscombe. The path then follows Seaton Bay past Beer, with Beer Quarry Caves a man-made cave complex, resulting from the quarrying of Beer stone and Seaton before going through The Undercliff SSSI and NNR and crossing the border into Dorset shortly before reaching Lyme Regis. =Dorset= Chesil Beach and Fortuneswell, looking north from the Isle of Portland Across the Dorset border, the Coast Path runs through the town of Lyme Regis where the Cobb breakwater was seen in the film The French Lieutenant's Woman and features on the film's poster. Further east, where it shares its route with the Monarch's Way, the path passes through Charmouth, up Golden Cap (the highest point on the south coast), and on through West Bay (near Bridport), to Burton Bradstock at the start of Chesil Beach, an tombolo. At Abbotsbury, the path leaves Chesil beach to follow the shores of the Fleet lagoon, until it reaches the terminus of Chesil beach next to the villages of Fortuneswell and Chiswell on the Isle of Portland. The path circumnavigates the Isle of Portland, passing the lighthouses at Portland Bill and the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy in Chiswell, and returns across Chesil beach to Wyke Regis (encompassing the Rodwell Trail) and along the shores of Portland Harbour to the Nothe Fort in the resort of Weymouth. Sculpture at South Haven Point, Studland, at the anticlockwise end of the path In Weymouth the coast path runs along Weymouth Harbour and the Wey Estuary up to Radipole Lake, through the town centre to the Esplanade on the shore of Weymouth Bay, and on to Ringstead Bay, with White Nothe at its eastern end, near the village of Osmington Mills. There is an alternative route around Weymouth and Portland along the South Dorset Downs, which reduces the footpath distance by . Just the loop around the Isle of Portland can be omitted, reducing the journey by . The coast path then heads towards the Isle of Purbeck, via Bat's Head, Swyre Head, Durdle Door—a natural arch which has been described as \\"one of Dorset's most recognisable features\\"—and Lulworth Cove, \\"the most visited geological locality in Britain\\". Further east is the deserted village of Tyneham, beside Worbarrow Bay, and Kimmeridge, next to Kimmeridge Bay, with its rocky shore and wave cut platform. Between Lulworth Cove and Kimmeridge the path passes through the Lulworth Ranges, which are not always open to the public. When the ranges are in use a road detour is needed. The coast path then reaches St Alban's Head, just to the south of the village of Worth Matravers. Between St Alban's Head and the resort of Swanage is Durlston Country Park nature reserve. North of Swanage is the chalk Ballard Down, the eastern tip of which has been eroded to form Old Harry Rocks – a series of stacks, arches and caves jutting into the sea between Swanage Bay and Studland Bay. This headland marks the end of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. Behind Studland beach, an extensive system of sand dunes have formed a psammosere, stretching for miles across the Studland peninsula. The peninsula forms one shore of Poole Harbour, one of the largest natural harbours in the world. Part of Studland beach is the National Trust's only official naturist beach. The South West Coast Path ends at South Haven Point, where there is a commemorative marker. The Sandbanks Ferry links this to the Sandbanks area of Poole on the eastern edge of the harbour. Intersecting and connecting paths From Plymouth to Poole the South West Coast Path forms part of the route of the E9 European Coastal Path which runs for 3,125 miles (5,000 km) from Cabo de São Vicente in Portugal to Narva-Jõesuu in Estonia. The route crosses by ferry from Roscoff to Plymouth, and beyond Poole the path follows the Bournemouth Coast Path to Milford on Sea, then the Solent Way (with an Isle of Wight option), South Downs Way, 1066 Country Walk and Saxon Shore Way to Dover, from where it returns to continental Europe. It is also part of the network of routes that form the International Appalachian Trail. The South West Coast Path, covering such a wide area, inevitably intersects with other, more local, routes, and it connects with many other long-distance paths offering opportunities for even longer expeditions: *Bournemouth Coast Path, from Sandbanks to Milford-on-Sea (Dorset and Hampshire) *Celtic Way — runs from the west of Wales to Stonehenge and then heads south-west to Cornwall, a total of *Channel to Channel Path, Seaton to Watchet, 80 kilometres (50 mi) *Coast to Coast, Devon, Wembury to Lynmouth *Coleridge Way, from Nether Stowey in the Quantocks across the Brendon Hills and the fringes of Exmoor National Park to the coast at Porlock. *East Devon Way, Exmouth to Lyme Regis *Exe Valley Way, Devon – runs from the River Exe estuary to Exmoor *Liberty Trail, Ham Hill to Lyme Regis (Somerset, Dorset) *The Macmillan Ways: **Macmillan Way from Abbotsbury in Dorset to Boston, Lincolnshire **Macmillan Way West from Castle Cary in Somerset to Barnstaple in Devon, (Boston to Barnstaple is **the Macmillan Abbotsbury Langport Link, which creates a short-cut for walkers from Abbotsbury to Barnstaple, a total of . *Saint's Way, Padstow — Fowey (Cornwall) *Samaritans Way South West, runs from Bristol to Lynton, but only the section from Bristol to Goathurst is waymarked * Tarka Trail. Between Ilfracombe and Bideford, the path mostly follows a coastal section of the Tarka Trail. For part of this route, the paths follow the course of disused railway lines: the Ilfracombe Branch Line, between Braunton and Barnstaple, and the Bideford Branch Line, between Barnstaple and Bideford. *Two Moors Way, Devon — Ivybridge to Lynmouth *Wessex Ridgeway, from Lyme Regis to Marlborough, which combined with The Ridgeway National Trail, the Icknield Way and the Peddars Way National Trail forms the Greater Ridgeway, , from Lyme Regis to Hunstanton on The Wash *West Devon Way — Okehampton to Plymouth, *West Somerset Coast Path — Minehead to Steart Peninsula (linking SWCP to the River Parrett Trail), Public transport The coast path shares the sea wall between Teignmouth and Dawlish Warren with long distance and Riviera Line trains. There are regular train services from other parts of the UK to the south west, principal destination stations being Barnstaple, Exeter, Newquay, Penzance, Plymouth and Weymouth. From these places local trains or buses connect to many points of the path. Airports at Bournemouth, Exeter and Newquay are served from a range of national and international destinations. Using public transport for at least part of the journey means that walkers can plan walks that start and finish at different places, rather than having to circle back to their start point to collect their cars. More than twenty railway stations give options either for short walks – such as Dawlish to Paignton – or for longer walks over several days. The West Somerset Railway offers steam and diesel services from Taunton to Minehead at the Somerset end of the path (using a connecting bus from Taunton railway station to ), the Swanage Railway connects Swanage to Wareham, and the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway connects Kingswear and Paignton. Long-distance bus services connect some coastal towns with railway stations: * Bideford and Westward Ho! to Barnstaple railway station * Bridport to Axminster railway station and Dorchester South railway station * Bude to Exeter St Davids railway station * Lyme Regis and Seaton to Axminster railway station * Minehead to Taunton railway station * Padstow to Bodmin Parkway railway station * Sidmouth to Honiton railway station * Swanage and Studland to Bournemouth railway station A boat service runs down the River Fal from Truro to Falmouth, and between Swanage seafront and Poole Quay.

She ruled from July 30, 1883 to February 28, 1897 in a reign marked by ultimately futile efforts to resist the colonial designs of the government of France. As a young woman, she was selected from among several Andriana qualified to succeed Queen Ranavalona II upon her death. Like both preceding queens, Ranavalona entered a political marriage with a member of the Hova elite named Rainilaiarivony, who largely oversaw the day-to-day governance of the kingdom and managed its foreign affairs in his role as prime minister. Ranavalona tried to stave off colonization by strengthening trade and diplomatic relations with foreign powers throughout her reign, but French attacks on coastal port towns and an assault on the capital city of Antananarivo led to the capture of the royal palace in 1895, ending the sovereignty and political autonomy of the century-old kingdom. Ranavalona and her court were initially permitted to remain as symbolic figureheads, but the outbreak of a popular resistance movement called the menalamba rebellion, and the discovery of anti-French political intrigues at court led the French to exile her to the island of Réunion in 1897. Rainilaiarivony died that same year, and Ranavalona was relocated to a villa in Algiers, along with several members of her family. The queen, her family, and the servants accompanying her were provided an allowance and enjoyed a comfortable standard of living, including occasional trips to Paris for shopping and sightseeing. Ranavalona was never permitted to return home to Madagascar, however, despite her repeated requests. She died of an embolism at her villa in Algiers in 1917 at age 55. Her remains were buried in Algiers but were disinterred 21 years later and shipped to Madagascar, where they were placed within the tomb of Queen Rasoherina on the grounds of the Rova of Antananarivo.  Early years  Ranavalona III, daughter of Andriantsimianatra and his wife and cousin,Le Dictionnaire universel des créatrices Written by Collectif, Antoinette Fouque, Mireille Calle-Gruber, Béatrice Didier Princess Raketaka, was born Princess Razafindrahety on November 22, 1861, at Amparibe, a rural village in the district of Manjakazafy outside Antananarivo.Trotter Matthews 1904, p. 243. Razafindrahety's lineage, as niece to Queen Ranavalona II and great- granddaughter of King Andrianampoinimerina, qualified her to potentially inherit the throne of the Kingdom of Madagascar.Titcomb 1896, pp. 530–542. Her parents assigned the care of the infant Razafindrahety to a slave who served the family.Stuart Robson 1896, pp. 103–104. Birthplace of Princess Razafindrahety in Manjakazafy. When she was old enough to attend school, Razafindrahety was taken into the custody of her aunt, Queen Ranavalona II, who ensured she began receiving a private education from a London Missionary Society (LMS) teacher. She was described as an industrious and inquisitive child with a strong love of studying the Bible, learning and reading, and she developed affectionate relationships with her teachers. She continued her education throughout her adolescence at the Congregational School of Ambatonakanga, the Friends High School for Girls, and the LMS Girls' Central School. She was baptized as a Protestant at Ambohimanga on April 5, 1874. Her teachers consistently described her as ranking among their strongest students. As a young woman, Razafindrahety married an Andriana (nobleman) named Ratrimo (Ratrimoarivony). Her husband died several years later on May 8, 1883, aged 22, leaving Razafindrahety a premature widow.Ministère de la marine et des colonies 1884, p. 117. According to rumor, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony may have arranged to have Ratrimo poisoned for political reasons. The Aristocratic Revolution of 1863, which had been orchestrated by Rainilaiarivony's older brother, Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, had replaced the absolute rule of the Andriana with a constitutional monarchy in which power was shared between an Andriana monarch and a Hova (freeman) prime minister. This arrangement was to be cemented by a political marriage between the prime minister and a ruling queen effectively selected by him. As Queen Ranavalona II neared death and the search for her successor began, Rainilaiarivony may have had Ratrimo deliberately poisoned so that Razafindrahety, the most eligible successor, would be free to marry the prime minister and succeed to the throne.  Reign  The queen standing next to the Royal crown and sceptre Ranavalona III was proclaimed queen upon the death of her predecessor, Queen Ranavalona II, on July 13, 1883, and moved into Tsarahafatra, a wooden house on the grounds of the royal Rova complex in Antananarivo.Nativel 2005, p. 112. Her coronation took place in the Mahamasina neighborhood of Antananarivo on November 22, 1883, her 22nd birthday, where she was given the title \\"Her Majesty Ranavalona III by the grace of God and the will of the people, Queen of Madagascar, and Protectoress of the laws of the Nation\\".Stratton 1964, p. 142. She chose to break with tradition by supplementing the customary retinue of soldiers at her ceremony with a group of 500 male and 400 female pupils from the capital's best schools. The girls were dressed in white while the boys wore soldiers' uniforms and performed traditional military drills with spears. Ranavalona was crowned wearing a white silk gown with a red train featuring embroidery and gold embellishments. The queen was described in the American press in the following terms: \\"She is a little above the ordinary height and has delicate features, her complexion is a little darker than that of most of her subjects. She appears quite timid and she presides well at the solemn functions of her court.\\" Like her two predecessors, Ranavalona concluded a political marriage with Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony. The young queen's role was largely ceremonial as nearly all important political decisions continued to be made by the much older and more experienced prime minister. Ranavalona was frequently called upon to deliver formal speeches (kabary) to the public on behalf of Rainilaiarivony and would make appearances to inaugurate new public buildings, such as a hospital at Isoavinandriana and a girls' school at Ambodin'Andohalo.Cousins 1895, p. 73. Throughout her reign, Ranavalona's aunt, Ramisindrazana, acted as an adviser and exercised considerable influence at court. Ranavalona's older sister, Rasendranoro, whose son Rakatomena and daughter Razafinandriamanitra lived with their mother at the Rova, was also a close companion. An American journalist who visited her palace reported that Ranavalona spent much of her leisure time flying kites or playing lotto, a parlor game, with her relatives and other ladies at court. She also enjoyed knitting, needlework and crocheting and would frequently bring her latest craft project to work on at cabinet meetings. She had a great love of fine garments and was the only Malagasy sovereign to import the majority of her clothing from Paris rather than London. She invited to Madagascar French stage magician Marius Cazeneuve to perform at her court. Reportedly, the queen and Cazeneuve developed a romantic relationship, and the magician was also working for the French intelligence, promoting French influence at court. = Franco-Hova War = Pith helmet in the Second French Empire style, worn by soldiers in the army of Ranavalona III (displayed at the Musée de l'Armée) As sovereign of Madagascar, Ranavalona III became involved in the endgame of the maneuvering that had been taking place between the British and French since the beginning of the century. The tension between France and Madagascar had grown especially acute in the three years prior to Ranavalona's succession, with an intensification of attacks in the months prior to her coronation. In February 1883 the northwestern coast was bombarded, followed by the occupation of Mahajanga by the French in May, and bombardment and capture of Toamasina in June. Attacks along the northern coast were ongoing at the time Ranavalona III was crowned in the summer of 1883. Shortly after the French initiated this latest round of hostilities, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony decided to engage Lieutenant Colonel Digby Willoughby, a Briton who had gained combat experience in the Anglo-Zulu War (but without having been a member of the British armed forces), to oversee the nation's military affairs and train the queen's army to defend the island against the seemingly inevitable French invasion. Merina soldiers fought to preserve Malagasy sovereignty against the French invasion. Throughout this period Madagascar continued to engage the French in negotiations, but these were to prove unsuccessful with both sides unwilling to capitulate on key points of contention. After two years of stalemate, a column brought an ultimatum to Antananarivo in December 1885, asking for the acceptance of French claims in northeastern Madagascar, a French protectorate over the Sakalava, recognition of French property principles and an indemnity of 1,500,000 francs. This peace treaty was ratified by Ranavalona and Rainilaiarivony in January 1886 and French government representatives two months later.Priestley 1967, p. 305. Prior to ratification, the queen and her prime minister sought clarification about several articles in the main treaty that stated \\"foreign relations\\" would be controlled by a French resident and referenced \\"establishments\\" at Diego-Suarez Bay. Two key French negotiators, Minister Patrimonio and Admiral Miot, provided an explanation affixed to the treaty as an annex, which led the rulers of Madagascar to deem the treaty an adequate enough safeguard of their nation's sovereignty to warrant their approval and signature. However, the official treaty was published in Paris without the annex or any reference to it. When the annex was later published in London, the French denied it had any legal validity. France declared a protectorate over the island despite the opposition of the Malagasy government and the omission of this term from the treaty. The international reaction to this latest turn of events was varied and greatly colored by national interests. The British were unwilling to defend Madagascar's sovereignty for fear that the French might retaliate and fail to recognize the British claim to certain protectorates of its own. All official British engagement with Madagascar was henceforth transacted through the French resident, but these communiques were not officially recognized by Ranavalona and her court. The United States and Germany, on the other hand, continued to deal directly with the queen's government as the rightful authority in Madagascar. This discrepancy forced a reinterpretation of one aspect of the treaty, resulting in the queen's authority over internal affairs being maintained. French troops landing in Mahajanga in 1895 In 1886, the queen attempted to solicit the support of the United States in preserving Madagascar's sovereignty by sending gifts to then-President Grover Cleveland, including silk akotofahana cloths, an ivory pin and a woven basket. However, the United States was neither able nor willing to assert itself militarily or diplomatically in favor of preserving Madagascar's independence. Ranavalona signed a treaty granting further concessions to the French on December 12, 1887. France's claim to Madagascar as its protectorate was officially recognized by Britain in the Anglo-French agreement of 1890.Curtin 1998, p. 186. Between 1890 and 1894, the French sought to aggressively claim what they believed to be the territorial rights established by the treaty. However, these French land claims and settlements were perceived by Ranavalona and Rainilaiarivony as an unjustifiable encroachment upon Malagasy sovereignty. Ultimately Charles Le Myre de Vilers was sent to persuade the queen and her prime minister to submit to the French interpretation of the treaty with the intent to launch a war and take the island by force if an agreement was not reached. The French offer was flatly refused and diplomatic relations between France and Madagascar were broken off in November 1894. Upon terminating diplomatic relations, the French bombarded and occupied the harbor of Toamasina on the east coast in December 1894, then captured Mahajanga on the west coast the following month and immediately began their gradual advance, constructing roads through the malarial swamps that hindered passage to the island's interior. The main expeditionary troops arrived in May. Over 6,000 of the original 15,000 French soldiers lost their lives to disease as they gradually moved inland,Roland, Fage & Sanderson 1985, p. 530. necessitating several thousand reinforcements drawn from French colonies in Algeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. The column reached the capital in September 1895. For three days the Malagasy army managed to hold the French troops at the periphery of the city, but upon French bombardment of the Rova palace compound with heavy artillery, Ranavalona agreed to surrender control of her kingdom to the French. = French colonization = Ranavalona conceded defeat to the French in September 1895, marking the end of the Merina monarchy. France officially annexed Madagascar on January 1, 1896. That August, the French officially declared Madagascar to be their colony and exiled Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to Algiers (in French Algeria) where he died the following year.Randrianja 2001, pp. 100–110. The queen and much of her administration remained but were afforded no real political power. Shortly after Rainilaiarivony's exile, Ranavalona was approached by a French official who informed her that a new prime minister would need to be selected. The queen hastily concluded that General Jacques Duchesne, the French general who had successfully led the military campaign against the Merina monarchy, would be a probable choice. Assuming that Malagasy political tradition would be preserved, Ranavalona believed she would be forced to marry whichever man was chosen for the job and worriedly asked if Duchesne was to be her next husband. Surprised, the French official reassured her that France had no intention of imposing a husband on the queen and would never again require her to marry a prime minister. The queen's minister of foreign affairs, Rainitsimbazafy, was nominated to the post of prime minister by mutual consent.Barrier 1996, p. 205. In December 1895, two months after the French capture of Antananarivo, popular resistance to French rule emerged in the form of the menalamba (\\"red shawl\\") rebellion. This guerrilla war against foreigners, Christianity and political corruption quickly spread throughout the island and was principally conducted by peasants who wore shawls smeared with the red laterite soil of the highlands. The resistance movement gained ground until it was effectively put down by the French military at the end of 1897.Campbell 1991, pp. 259–291. Members of Ranavalona's court were accused of encouraging the rebels and many leading figures were executed, including the queen's uncle Ratsimamanga (brother of her favored adviser, Ramisindrazana) and her minister of war, Rainandriamampandry. Ramisindrazana, the queen's aunt, was exiled to Réunion, as the French were reluctant to execute a woman.Basset 1903, pp. 140–142. The resistance led the government of France to replace the island's civil governor, Hippolyte Laroche, with a military governor, Joseph Gallieni. The day before Gallieni arrived in Antananarivo, he had a message sent to the queen requiring her to present herself and her entourage at the military headquarters, preceded by a standard bearer carrying a French flag. The queen was obliged to sign documents handing over all royal property to France before being placed under arrest and imprisoned in her own palace. She was only allowed to receive visitors who had obtained prior authorization from Gallieni himself. While imprisoned, Ranavalona offered to convert to Roman Catholicism in an attempt to curry French favor but was informed that such a gesture was no longer necessary.  Exile  Gallieni exiled Ranavalona from Madagascar on February 27, 1897, and officially abolished the monarchy the next day. French officials ordered the queen to leave her palace at 1:30 in the morning. She was carried from Antananarivo by palanquin as the city slept, accompanied by 700–800 escorts and porters.Barrier 1996, pp. 245–246. Throughout the days spent traveling to the eastern port of Toamasina where she would board a ship to Réunion, Ranavalona reportedly drank heavily. At Toamasina on March 6, Ranavalona was notified that her sister Rasendranoro and aunt Ramasindrazana would be arriving shortly, as would the queen's fourteen-year-old niece, Razafinandriamanitra, who was nine months pregnant with the illegitimate child of a French soldier.Barrier 1996, p. 260. = Réunion Island = The queen in exile on Réunion Together, the family sailed on La Peyrouse to the port of Pointe des Galets, a site twenty kilometers (12.5 miles) from the capital of St. Denis, to secure a discreet arrival. Despite this effort, a crowd of French onlookers jeered and shouted as the boat docked, angry at the queen for the loss of French lives incurred during France's campaign to occupy Madagascar. After waiting for the crowd to disperse, the captain escorted the queen and her party into a horse-drawn buggy, the first Ranavalona had ever seen, and drove to the Hotel de l'Europe in St. Denis. Young Razafinandriamanitra, suffering from the emotional and physical strains of the journey into exile, went into labor shortly after reaching the hotel. She gave birth to a little girl on her second day in Réunion, but could not recover her strength and died five days later. The infant was named Marie-Louise and was baptised a Catholic to avoid antagonizing the French. Marie-Louise, who could have become heir-apparent according to the traditional rules of succession, was adopted by Ranavalona as her own daughter.Barrier 1996, pp. 260–266. Within a month the party had been moved to a house owned by a Madame de Villentroy, located at the corner of rue de l'Arsenal and rue du Rempart near the French government offices in St. Denis. Ranavalona was reportedly pleased with the two-story house, which had a large walled garden and featured a peaked roof and wrap-around veranda reminiscent of the traditional highland homes of Madagascar. In addition to the queen and her aunt, sister, and grand- niece, the royal household included two secretaries, a cook, a maid, three servants for Ranavalona, and several more servants for her aunt and sister. The queen's private pastor was authorized to make visits freely to the royal household.Barrier 1996, p. 267. The queen's party occupied the house in Réunion for just under two years. As tensions between the United Kingdom and France began to mount once again, this time over the conflict in Sudan, the French authorities became concerned that elements of the population in Madagascar might seize the opportunity to launch a new rebellion against French rule. The queen's proximity to Madagascar was seen as a possible source of encouragement for would-be Malagasy rebels. French authorities made an abrupt decision to remove Ranavalona and her party to Algeria, a more distant location. On February 1, 1899, with very little forewarning, Ranavalona and her family were ordered aboard the Yang-Tse accompanied by a secretary- interpreter and several maids.Barrier 1996, pp. 269–271. During the 28-day journey to the French port of Marseilles, the passengers stopped over at such ports as Mayotte, Zanzibar, Aden and Djibouti.Barrier 1996, pp. 273–274. Throughout the trip, the various captains responsible for the journey were under orders to prevent Ranavalona from speaking with anyone who was not French. The party was held for several months at Marseilles before being transferred to a villa in the Mustapha Superieur area in Algiers. Ranavalona had hoped to continue on to Paris and was greatly disappointed to learn she was instead being sent to Algeria, reportedly bursting into tears and remarking, \\"Who is certain of tomorrow? Only yesterday I was a queen; today I am simply an unhappy, broken-hearted woman.\\" = Algiers, Algeria = At the queen's villa in Algiers, Ranavalona was provided with servants and a French female attendant who kept her under observation and remained present whenever the queen entertained guests in her home. In addition, the government of France initially provided Ranavalona with an annual allowance of 25,000 francs paid from the budget for the colony of Madagascar and authorized by the colony's Governor General. Nearly all the queen's property had been seized by the colonial authority, although she had been permitted to keep certain personal belongings, including some of her jewelry. Her initial pension allowed such a humble lifestyle that the colonial government of Algeria lobbied unsuccessfully several times on her behalf to obtain an increase for her. Ranavalona also tasked a servant with selling some of her jewelry for cash, but the plan was discovered by the French colonial authorities and the servant was discharged and sent back to Madagascar. During the first years of her exile in Algeria, Ranavalona soon discovered the excitement of the socialite lifestyle among the elite of Algiers. She was regularly invited to parties, outings and cultural events and often hosted events of her own.Barrier 1996, pp. 288–303. However, homesickness was ever-present and the impossibility of visiting Madagascar contributed to melancholy and boredom. She would frequently take long walks alone in the countryside, along the beach, or through the town to clear her mind and lift her spirits.Barrier 1996, p. 347. The queen was eager to see mainland France and especially Paris and repeatedly submitted formal requests for permission to travel. These were routinely denied until May 1901 when Ranavalona received the first of many authorizations to visit France. That very month, the queen moved into a small apartment in the 16th arrondissement of Paris near the Avenue Champs-Élysées and what is now the Place Charles de Gaulle, from which she visited the major sights of the city and was invited to numerous receptions, balls, shows and other events. She was widely received by high society with courtesy and admiration and was offered many gifts including a costly gown. During this first trip, Ranavalona visited the Palace of Versailles, was formally received at the Paris City Hall, and spent three weeks on vacation in Bordeaux. Finally, Ranavalona visited the beaches of Arcachon before exhausting her budget and boarding an Algeria-bound ship at Marseilles in early August.Bergougniou, Clignet & David 2001, pp. 87–89. The details of her visit attracted much attention from the Parisian press, which expressed sympathy for the queen's fate and recrimination toward the French government for failing to provide a larger pension or accord her the consideration she deserved as a recipient of the Legion of Honor. Ranavalona on a Petit Beurre biscuits box in 1916. The inscription reads Tsara ny Petit Beurre (Malagasy: \\"Petit Beurre is good\\"). Ranavalona would return to France six more times over the course of the next twelve years. Her frequent visits and excellent reputation made her the cause célèbre of many French citizens who pitied the queen's fate and admired her gracious acceptance of her new life. Ranavalona's visits were generally accompanied by much media fanfare and the queen's popularity among the French public grew to the extent that she was featured on the box of Petit Beurre biscuits in 1916.Barrier 1996, p. 334. The queen's second visit to France occurred in September 1903, when she visited Vic-sur-Cère and Aurillac. Pressure by citizens during this visit succeeded in raising her pension to 37,000 francs. Two years later she would visit Marseilles and Saint-Germain and inhabit a large five-bedroom Parisian apartment in the sixteenth arrondissement from which she would attend the Paris Opera, observe a session of the French House of Representatives and be formally received at the Ministry of the Colonies. Again due to pressure from sympathetic French citizens, Ranavalona's pension was further raised to 50,000 francs per annum. On her next visit in 1907, the queen would use Dives-sur-Mer as a home base to visit the Calvados region, where she was photographed for the French press. From August to September 1910, Ranavalona would visit Paris, Nantes, La Baule and Saint-Nazaire and was repeatedly the target of undesired attention from press photographers. Her 1912 trip to the tiny, remote village of Quiberville would coincide with the increase of her annual pension to 75,000 francs. The queen's final voyage in 1913 would take her to Marseilles, Aix-les-Bains and Allevard. The advent of World War 1 in 1914 put an end to Ranavalona's visits to France. Throughout her time in Algeria, she and her family regularly attended the weekly Protestant service at the Reformed Church building in central Algiers.Saillens 1906. After the war began she sought to contribute by vigorously participating in the activities of the Algerian Red Cross.  Death and aftermath  The Queen with niece Marie-Louise at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, in 1905 Ranavalona died without ever having returned to Madagascar, after two formal requests in 1910 and 1912 were refused on the pretext of insufficient funds in the colonial coffers. The exiled queen died suddenly at her villa in Algeria on May 23, 1917, the victim of a severe embolism. Ranavalona was buried at the Saint-Eugene cemetery in Algiers at 10:00 a.m. on May 25. Her funeral was attended by dozens of personal friends, admirers, Red Cross colleagues, members of her church congregation and prominent figures of the political and cultural elite of Algiers. By nine in the morning, a long line of cars had already formed at the entrance to the memorial site. This effusive display of respect and remembrance on the part of Ranavalona's friends was not mirrored by subsequent actions of the French colonial administration in Madagascar. In June 1925, eight years after the queen's death, the Governor- General of Algeria informed the Governor-General of Madagascar by letter that payments for the maintenance of Ranavalona's tomb were in default. He urged the colonial government in Madagascar to provide funds for the upkeep of the dilapidated tomb, emphasizing that such neglect was unworthy of the queen's memory and the government of France alike. The request was twice refused and the tomb was never refurbished. In November 1938, Ranavalona's remains were exhumed and re-interred in the tomb of Queen Rasoherina at the Rova of Antananarivo in Madagascar. A fire on the night of November 6, 1995 severely damaged the royal tombs and destroyed most of the other buildings at the site. The lamba-wrapped remains of Ranavalona III were the only ones that could be saved from the flames. These have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.Andrianjafitrimo 2007, p. 187. Following Ranavalona's death, her aunt Ramasindrazana left Algeria and moved to Alpes-Maritimes where she lived out the few remaining years of her life. The heir-apparent, Marie-Louise, had left Ranavalona's villa several years earlier to study at a French high school and would go on to marry a French agricultural engineer named Andre Bosshard on June 24, 1921. Although she continued to receive a small pension from the French government throughout her lifetime, Marie-Louise chose to pursue a career as a nurse and was awarded the Legion of Honor for her medical services during World War II. After Bosshard and the childless Marie-Louise divorced, the young woman reportedly made the most of her new-found freedom as a flamboyant and vivacious socialite. Marie-Louise died in Bazoches-sur-le-Betz on January 18, 1948, without leaving any descendants, and was buried in Montreuil, France.Barrier 1996, p. 358.

To the south, Anglia is separated from the neighbouring peninsula of Swania (Ger. Schwansen, Dan. Svans or Svansø) by the Sly Firth (Ger. Schlei, Dan. Sli), and to the north from the Danish peninsula of Sundeved (Ger. Sundewitt) and the Danish island of Als (Ger. Alsen) by the Flensburg Firth (Ger. Flensburger Förde, Dan. Flensborg Fjord). The landscape is hilly, dotted with numerous lakes. Whether ancient Anglia conformed to the borders of the Anglian Peninsula is uncertain. It may have been somewhat larger; however, the ancient sources mainly concur that it also included the peninsula's territory. Anglia has a significance far beyond its current small area and country terrain, in that it is believed to have been the original home of the Angles, Germanic settlers in East Anglia, Central and Northern England, and the Eastern Scottish Lowlands. Their migration led to their new homeland being named after them, from which the name \\"England\\" derives. England, East, Mid and West Anglia as well as the English language, thus, ultimately derive at least their names from Anglia. Terminology The German word Angeln has been hypothesised to originate from the Germanic Proto-Indo-European root *h₂enǵʰ-, meaning \\"narrow\\", meaning here \\"the Narrow [Water]\\", i.e. the Sly Firth; the root would be *angh-, \\"tight\\" (compare Ger. and Dutch eng = \\"narrow\\", \\"England\\" = Ger. England, \\"narrow land\\" = Ger. enges Land). The \\"-n\\"-ending is the most common ending for geographical regions in German, comparable to the English endings \\"-ia\\" and \\"-y\\": \\"Croatia\\" = Kroatien, \\"Italy\\" = Italien. In German, the word Angeln has three other meanings: as a verb, angeln means \\"to angle\\". It is written with a capitalized initial letter in its nominalized form: das Angeln (n) = \\"(the) angling\\" (compare \\"(the) fishing\\" = das Fischen (n) or die Fischerei (f)). When used with the plural article, Angeln means \\"fishing rods\\": die Angel (long form: die Angelrute) (f) = \\"the fishing rod\\", die Angeln (die Angelruten) (p) = \\"the fishing rods\\". Finally, the term Angeln also refers to the people of the Angles: die Angeln (p) = \\"the Angles\\", while Eng. \\"the angel\\" = Ger. der Engel (m), \\"the angle\\" = der Winkel (m), \\"the angler\\" = der Angler (m), and \\"the fisherman\\" = der Fischer (m). There is also a theory that Angeln meant \\"hook\\" (as in angling for fish), in reference to the shape of the peninsula. Compare Old Norse ǫngull and Modern Nynorsk angel or ongel, with the meaning (fish) hook, cognate with English angle. Linguist Julius Pokorny derived it from the Proto-Indo-European root *ang-, \\"bend\\" (see ankle).Barber, Charles, Joan C. Beal and Philip A. Shaw 2009. The English language. A historical introduction. Second edition of Barber (1993). Cambridge: University Press. It is also possible that the Angles may have been called such because they were a fishing people or were originally descended from such.Baugh, Albert C. and Thomas Cable 1993 A history of the English language. 4th edition. (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall)  Geography  Schleswig-Flensburg/Slesvig-Flensborg Physical map of Schleswig-Holstein, Anglia in the northeast Lake Südensee (German) or Søndersø (Danish), a glacial lake in Anglia Together with Swania (Ger. Schwansen, Dan. Svans or Svansø), Danish Wahld (Ger. Dänischer Wohld, Dan. Jernved) and Wagria (Ger. Wagrien, Dan. Vagrien), Anglia is one of four peninsulas along the Baltic Sea coast of the northernmost German federal state of Schleswig-Holstein. As part of the Schleswig-Holstein Morainic Uplands (Ger. Schleswig-Holsteinisches Moränenhügelland), that were formed during the Weichselian glaciation, these peninsulas are hilly and dotted with several glacial lakes. The Anglian glacial lakes form the North Anglian Lake Group (Ger. Nordangeliter Seengruppe). The River Treene (Dan. Trenen) with its main headstream Bondenau (Dan. Bondeåen) rises in Anglia. Although rising on the Anglian Peninsula in the Baltic Sea, the Treene flows towards the North Sea, being the main tributary of the River Eider (Dan. Ejderen), the river that constituted the Southern border of the Danish Realm for a very long time. The northernmost part of Anglia is formed by the Holnis (Dan. Holnæs) Peninsula that protrudes into the Flensburg Firth. Apart from Flensburg, which is an independent town, the Anglian Peninsula belongs to the district of Schleswig-Flensburg (Dan. Slesvig-Flensborg), Germany's northeasternmost district (seat: Schleswig/Slesvig). This comparatively rural district has approximately 200 025 inhabitants (as of 31.12.2018).  Languages  9th to the 11th century, Danish was spoken on the peninsulas of Anglia and Swania (red), the Danish Wahld peninsula was uninhabited (grey), Slavic dialects (Polabian) were spoken on the peninsula of Wagria and on the island of Fehmarn (brown), Old Saxon was spoken south of the River Eider (blue-grey), and North Frisian was spoken in North Frisia (yellow). In the 19th century, a language shift from Danish to Low German occurred in Anglia. The main language of Anglia is German. The peninsula is, however, also part of the Low German (Low Saxon) language area, a language which is more closely related to English than German since it was not affected by the High German consonant shift. Danish was the main language of Anglia from the 9th to the 19th century. The Danish variety indigenous to Anglia was Anglian Danish (Dan. Angeldansk or Angelbomål, Ger. Angeldänisch), a dialect of South Jutlandic (Synnejysk, Dan. Sønderjysk, Ger. Südjütisch or Südjütländisch), the southernmost variety of Danish spoken on the Jutland Peninsula, once spoken as far south as Eckernförde-Borby (Dan. Egernførde or Egernfjord-Borreby) on the Eckernförde Bay (Ger. Eckernförder Bucht, Dan. Egernførde Fjord). In the 19th century, however, a language shift towards Low German occurred. Danish is still spoken in Anglia by a minority, but in Southern Schleswig Danish dialects, which are not dialects of South Jutlandic, but Low German-influenced dialects of Standard Danish. The cities with the largest Danish-speaking minorities are Flensburg/Flensborg, Schleswig/Slesvig and Glücksburg/Lyksborg. Many Anglian placenames are of Danish origin, like all placenames ending on -by (meaning \\"city\\"; e.g. Brodersby-Goltoft, Flensburg-Engelsby/Flensborg-Engelsby, Flensburg-Jürgensby/Flensborg- Jørgensby, Nieby/Nyby) and -rup (meaning \\"village\\"; e.g. Sörup/Sørup, Sterup, Tastrup/Tostrup). There are many placenames of Danish origin in England as well (e.g. Derby, Rugby, Whitby), but in Danish, German and Swedish, -by is pronounced , and not , as in England. North Frisian, one of the Frisian languages, that form the Anglo-Frisian languages together with English, is spoken in many dialectal variants in neighbouring North Frisia along the North Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein and on the North Frisian Islands. History =Early history= Flensburg/Flensborg is the largest town in Anglia. View of the borough of Jürgensby/Jørgensby on the Anglian side of the Flensburg Firth. Schleswig/Slesvig Glücksburg Castle The region was home to the Germanic people, the Angles, some of whom, together with Saxons and Jutes, left their home to migrate to Britain in the 5th and 6th centuries. For the years 449-455, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, written around 890, describes how King Vortigern (a British tribal king) invited the Angles to come and receive land in return for helping him defend against marauding Picts. Those successful Angles sent word back that good land was available and that the British were 'worthless'. A wholesale emigration of Angles and kindred German peoples followed. The Chronicle, commissioned by King Alfred the Great, drew on earlier oral traditions and on the few written fragments available. The best of these, written around 730, was by the monk Bede whose history of English Christianity had the following brief account of the origin and distribution of the Angles: The phrase \\"north of the Humber\\" refers to the northern kingdom of Northumbria, which includes what is now north and north-eastern England and part of southern Scotland. Mercia was located in central England and broadly corresponds to what is now known as the English Midlands. This account can be related to the evidence of archaeology, notably the distribution of types of fibulae, or brooches, worn by both men and women in antiquity. Eastern coastal and Northern Britain were settled by groups wearing cruciform brooches, of the style in fashion at the time in coastal Scandinavia, all of Denmark, and Schleswig-Holstein south to the lower Elbe and east to the Oder, as well as a pocket in coastal Friesland. =Later history= After the Angles departed from Anglia, by the 8th century the region was occupied by Danes. This is reflected in the large number of place names ending in -by (meaning \\"city\\") in the region today. In the 10th century, the chronicler Æthelweard reports that the most important town in Anglia was Hedeby (Ger. Haithabu). Later Anglia's history is subsumed in that of the larger surrounding region, which came to be known as Southern Jutland or Schleswig (Dan. Slesvig). Until the 19th century the area belonged to Denmark. In terms of ethnic and linguistic heritage the countryside spoke a Danish dialect until the early 1800s after which Low German spread northwards, whereas the towns spoke Low German from the late medieval era. Denmark lost Schleswig to Austria and Prussia in 1864 as a result of the Second Schleswig War. In 1920, following Germany's defeat in the First World War, a plebiscite was held to determine which areas should return to Danish control. As a result of the plebiscite, the northern part of Schleswig returned to Denmark, but Anglia remained in Germany. See Schleswig- Holstein Question for a detailed history.

A moderate unionist, who sought to reconcile the sectarian divisions in Northern Ireland society, he was Member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland for the Bannside constituency from 1946 until his resignation in January 1970; his successor in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland was Ian Paisley, while control of the UUP also passed to more hard-line elements. Background O'Neill Conroy family tree Terence O'Neill was born on 10 September 1914 at 29 Ennismore Gardens, Hyde Park, London.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He was the youngest son of Lady Annabel Hungerford Crewe-Milnes (daughter of Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe) and Captain Arthur O'Neill of Shane's Castle, Randalstown, the first member of parliament (MP) to be killed in action during the First World War. The family assumed the surname O'Neill by royal licence in lieu of their original name Chichester. The Chichester's trace their lineage to the name O'Neill through Mary Chichester, daughter of Henry O'Neill of Shane's Castle. O'Neill's younger half-brother was Quentin Crewe. O'Neill grew up in London and was educated at West Downs School, Winchester and Eton College. He spent summer holidays in Ulster. Following school he spent a year in France and Germany and then worked in the City of London and Australia. In May 1940 he received a commission at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and went on to serve in the 6th Guards Tank Brigade during the Second World War, in which both of his brothers died. Like many other unionist politicians, the rank he held during the war followed him into his political career, hence \\"Captain\\" Terence O'Neill.McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), Making Sense of The Troubles, Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p.27 On 4 February 1944 he married Katharine Jean, the daughter of William Ingham Whitaker, of Pylewell Park, Lymington, Hampshire. They had one son, Patrick (b. 1945), and one daughter, Anne (b. 1947). Like all Prime Ministers of Northern Ireland, he was a member of the Orange Order. Politics At the end of 1945, O'Neill and his family went to live in Northern Ireland in a converted Regency rectory near Ahoghill, County Antrim. In a by-election in 1946, he was elected as the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MP for the Bannside constituency in the Parliament of Northern Ireland, which sat at Parliament Buildings at Stormont. O'Neill served in a series of junior positions. He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health and Local Government from February 1948 until November 1953, when he was appointed Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland. In 1953 he served as High Sheriff of Antrim. He was elevated to Cabinet level in the Government of Northern Ireland in April 1956 when he was made Minister of Home Affairs and sworn into the Privy Council of Northern Ireland. Six months later he was also appointed as Minister of Finance, a senior portfolio that he administered alongside Home Affairs until he divested the latter to focus on Finance. He remained Minister of Finance until his appointment as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland in 1963. Prime Minister In 1963, O'Neill succeeded Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. He introduced new policies that would have been unthinkable with Lord Brookeborough as Prime Minister. He aimed to end sectarianism and to bring Catholics and Protestants into working relationships. A visit to a convent proved controversial among many Protestants. He also had aspirations in the industrial sector, seeking improved relations with the trade union movement and attracting new investment from abroad to replace failing industry in Northern Ireland. O'Neill seemed to strongly believe in industrialisation and modernisation. However it is clear that he was in some ways trying to prevent the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) from gaining ground.McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), Making Sense of The Troubles, Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p.29 Northern Ireland was influenced by British politics so the arrival of Harold Wilson in Downing Street meant the NILP had a significant ally there. Wilson was not a committed UUP supporter, so that O'Neill was the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who could not rely on the support of the UK Government. As O'Neill promoted industrialisation and modernisation, Taoiseach Seán Lemass was doing similar things in the Republic of Ireland, thus leading to the first real rapprochement between the two jurisdictions since partition.McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), Making Sense of The Troubles, Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p.30 In January 1965, O'Neill invited the Taoiseach for talks in Belfast. O'Neill met with strong opposition from his own party, having informed very few of the visit, and from Ian Paisley, who rejected any dealings with the Republic. Paisley and his followers threw snowballs at Lemass' car during the visit. In February, O'Neill visited Lemass in Dublin. Opposition to O'Neill's reforms was so strong that in 1967 George Forrest – the MP for Mid Ulster, who supported the Prime Minister – was pulled off the platform at the Twelfth of July celebrations in Coagh, County Tyrone, and kicked unconscious by fellow members of the Orange Order.Mid-Ulster 1950-1970 In December 1967, Lemass' successor Jack Lynch travelled to Stormont for his first meeting with O'Neill. On 8 January 1968, they met again in Dublin. On 19 January 1968, O'Neill made a speech marking five years in office to members of the Irish Association, calling for \\"a new endeavour by organisations in Northern Ireland to cross denominational barriers and advance the cause of better community relations\\". On 20 May 1968, O'Neill was pelted with eggs, flour and stones by members of the Woodvale Unionist Association who disapproved of his policies. In 1968, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) began street demonstrations. The march across Derry on 5 October 1968, banned by William Craig the Minister of Home Affairs, was met with violence from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) who used batons on protesters, among whom were prominent politicians. The O'Neill government was unable to deal with the disturbances, so Harold Wilson summoned O'Neill to Downing Street.McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), Making Sense of The Troubles, Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p. 42 The Stormont cabinet minutes from 14 October show O'Neill recalling his time in Britain. He stated that Wilson had threatened to take over if O'Neill could not manage to gain control. Finally he concluded that if they couldn't manage it politically then they would be forced into a period of governance by police power alone.McKittrick, David, and David McVea (2002), Making Sense of The Troubles, Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, p.43 The police violence was filmed by RTÉ television and broadcast worldwide. The date of this march is taken by some historians as being the start of the Northern Ireland Troubles. In response to these events, O'Neill introduced a Five Point Reform Programme. This granted a number of the concessions that NICRA had demanded but importantly it did not include one man one vote in local government council elections. Despite this the NICRA felt it had made some ground and agreed to postpone its marches. While things were expected to improve, many Catholics felt let down by the limited reforms. A group was formed by university-based activists including Bernadette Devlin and Michael Farrell, named People's Democracy, which began a four-day march from Belfast to Derry on 1 January 1969. On the fourth day, the march was attacked during the Burntollet Bridge incident by around 200 hardline unionists. Although many RUC men were present during the attack none intervened. It later emerged that some of the assailants were in fact off-duty policemen. Many marchers were injured, 13 requiring hospital treatment. The Burntollet attack sparked several days of rioting between the RUC and Catholic protesters in the Bogside area of Derry. In February 1969, O'Neill called a surprise general election because of the turmoil inside the UUP, after twelve dissident MPs signed a motion of no confidence against O'Neill, and Brian Faulkner resigned from the Government following its appointment of the Cameron Commission. Although pro-O'Neill candidates won a plurality of seats in the general election, O'Neill lost an overall majority among UUP MPs in order to pass his reforms through Parliament. Resignation From O'Neill's point of view, the 1969 general election was inconclusive. He was humiliated by his near-defeat in his own constituency of Bannside by Ian Paisley and resigned as leader of the UUP and as Prime Minister on 28 April 1969 after a series of bomb explosions on Belfast's water supply by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) brought his personal political crisis to a head. In an interview with the Belfast Telegraph published on 10 May 1969 he stated: \\"It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants that if you give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets; they will refuse to have eighteen children. But if a Roman Catholic is jobless, and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church\\".Online quotation accessed 14-1-2009 Retirement He retired from Stormont politics in January 1970 when he resigned his seat, having become the Father of the House in the previous year. On 23 January 1970, he was created a life peer as Baron O'Neill of the Maine, of Ahoghill in the County of Antrim. (The Maine (or Main) is a river which flows near Ahoghill.) He spent his last years at Lisle Court, Lymington, Hampshire, although he continued to speak on the problems of Northern Ireland in the House of Lords where he sat as a cross-bencher. He appeared on the BBC Election Night programme in October 1974, where he clashed with the newly elected Ulster Unionist Party MP for South Down, Enoch Powell, over Northern Ireland's politics.Film of the exchange, 'Enoch Powell after election victory in 1974', published on Youtube 19 January 2015. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS9-_CKhGSE His reform policies are largely forgotten by British Unionists and Irish Nationalists in Northern Ireland; however, he is remembered by historians for his efforts to reform the discrimination and sectarianism within the region during the 1960s. In retirement he was also a trustee of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust. Death He died at his home of cancer on 12 June 1990. He was survived by his wife, son, and daughter.

It is based on a novella by Elinor Glyn that was originally serialized in Cosmopolitan magazine. This film turned actress Clara Bow into a major star, and led people to label her the It girl. The film had its world premiere in Los Angeles on January 14, 1927, followed by a New York showing on February 5, 1927. \\"It\\" was released to the general public on February 19, 1927. The picture was considered lost for many years, but a Nitrate-copy was found in Prague in the 1960s.Lynn Langway, July 26, 1970, San Antonio Express In 2001, \\"It\\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot Spunky shopgirl Betty Lou Spence (Clara Bow) has a crush on her handsome employer, Cyrus Waltham, Jr. (Antonio Moreno), the new manager of and heir to the \\"world's largest store\\". However, they belong to different social classes and he is already romantically linked to blonde socialite Adela Van Norman (Jacqueline Gadsden). But Cyrus's silly friend Monty (William Austin) notices Betty, and she uses him to get closer to Cyrus. When Betty finally gets Cyrus's attention, she convinces him to take her on a date to Coney Island, where he is introduced to the proletarian pleasures of roller coasters and hot dogs and has a wonderful time. At the end of the evening, he tries to kiss her. She slaps his face and hurries out of his car and into her flat, but then peeks out her window at him as he is leaving. The next day, meddling welfare workers are trying to take away the baby of Betty's sickly roommate Molly (Priscilla Bonner). To protect her friend, Betty bravely claims that the baby is in fact hers. Unfortunately, this is overheard by Monty, who tells Cyrus. Although he is in love with her, Cyrus offers her an \\"arrangement\\" that includes everything but marriage. Shocked and humiliated, Betty Lou refuses. She soon strives to forget the whole ordeal ever occurred, forgetting Cyrus for the time being. When she learns from Monty about Cyrus's misunderstanding, she fumes and vows to teach her former beau a lesson. When Cyrus hosts a yachting excursion, Betty Lou makes Monty take her along, masquerading as \\"Miss Van Cortland\\". Cyrus at first wants to remove her from the ship, but he cannot long resist Betty Lou's it factor; he eventually corners her and proposes marriage, but she gets him back, by telling him that she'd \\"rather marry his office boy\\", which accomplishes her goal, but breaks her heart. He then learns the truth about the baby and leaves Monty at the yacht's helm to find her. Monty crashes the yacht into a fishing boat, tossing both Betty Lou and Adela into the water. Betty Lou saves Adela, punching her in the face when she panics and threatens to drown them both. At the end of the film, she and Cyrus reconcile on the anchor of the yacht, with the first two letters of the ship's name, Itola, between them. Monty and Adela are upset at losing their friends, but it is implied they pursue a relationship with each other as the film ends.

It was his 22nd book, and his 17th novel written under his own name. The story follows the experiences of seven children as they are terrorized by an evil entity that exploits the fears of its victims to disguise itself while hunting its prey. \\"It\\" primarily appears in the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown to attract its preferred prey of young children. The novel is told through narratives alternating between two periods and is largely told in the third-person omniscient mode. It deals with themes that eventually became King staples: the power of memory, childhood trauma and its recurrent echoes in adulthood, and overcoming evil through mutual trust and sacrifice. King has stated that he first conceived the story in 1978, and began writing it in 1981. He finished writing the book in 1985. He also stated that he originally wanted the title character to be a troll like the one in the children's story \\"Three Billy Goats Gruff\\", but who inhabited the local sewer system rather than just the area beneath one bridge. He also wanted the story to interweave the stories of children and the adults they later become. The novel won the British Fantasy Award in 1987, and received nominations for the Locus and World Fantasy Awards that same year. Publishers Weekly listed It as the best-selling hardcover fiction book in the United States in 1986. It has been adapted into a 1990 two-part miniseries directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, a Hindi 1998 television series directed by Glen Baretto & Ankush Mohla, and into a film duology directed by Andy Muschietti; It was released in September 2017 and It Chapter Two was released in September 2019. Plot =1957–1958= During a heavy rainstorm in Derry, Maine, a six-year-old boy named Georgie Denbrough sails a paper boat his brother made for him along the rainy streets before it washes down into a storm drain. Peering into the drain, startled from seeing a pair of glowing yellow eyes, Georgie encounters an eccentric clown who introduces himself as \\"Mr. Bob Gray\\", a.k.a. \\"Pennywise the Dancing Clown\\". Georgie declines a balloon but is enticed by Pennywise to reach into the drain and retrieve his boat, the clown ripping the child's arm off before leaving Georgie to die from bleeding out. His body is later discovered and brought back to the Denbroughs' house. The following June, an overweight eleven-year- old boy named Ben Hanscom is harassed by a bully named Henry Bowers and his gang, escaping into the marshy wasteland known as the Barrens when attacked by his tormentors on the last day of school. There, Ben befriends an asthmatic hypochondriac named Eddie Kaspbrak and \\"Stuttering Bill\\" Denbrough, Georgie's elder brother who suffers from a stutter and rides on a rusty bike named \\"Silver\\". The three boys later befriend fellow misfits Richie Tozier, Stanley \\"Stan\\" Uris, and Beverly Marsh, who eventually refer to themselves as \\"The Losers Club\\". As the summer draws on, the Losers each encounter Pennywise in terrifying manifestations: a mummy on a frozen canal to Ben, a fountain of blood (that only children can see) from Beverly's sink, a diseased and rotting leper to Eddie, drowned corpses to Stan, and a frightening phantom of Georgie to Bill. The Losers eventually realize they are all being stalked by the same child-killing entity which killed Eddie Corcoran in the form of the Gill-man. Meanwhile, an increasingly unhinged and sadistic Bowers begins focusing his attention on his African-American neighbor Mike Hanlon and his father. Bowers kills Mike's dog and chases the terrified boy into the Barrens, where he joins the Losers in driving Bowers' gang off in a rock fight, a humiliated Bowers vowing revenge. Mike becomes a member of the Losers Club after revealing his own encounter with Pennywise in the form of a flesh-eating bird. While showing the Losers his historical scrapbook, the group realizes that \\"It\\" is a monster with a hold on the town. Following further encounters with It, the Losers construct a makeshift smoke hole that Richie and Mike use to hallucinate It's origins as an ancient alien entity that came to Earth in a meteor and feeds on children for a year before entering a 27-year-long hibernation. In late July, after Eddie is hospitalized by Bowers and several of his friends, Beverly stumbles across the Bowers gang in the landfill, literally with their pants down, lighting farts with fire for fun. She hides behind a junked car and witnesses one of the bullies, Patrick Hockstetter, killed by It in the form of a mass of leeches while emptying a refrigerator he used to trap and kill injured animals. The Losers later discover a message from It written in Patrick's blood, warning them that It will kill them if they interfere. After Eddie is released from the hospital with a broken arm, Ben makes two silver slugs out of a silver dollar on the belief that silver will harm It. The story's narrative changes to Pennywise's perspective at that point, revealing It as a being from another reality known as the Macroverse that nourishes itself on fear from terrorizing children in the forms It assumes. The Losers travel to the house on Neibolt Street, where Eddie, Bill, and Richie had previously encountered It, forcing Pennywise to flee into the sewers after the Losers wound It with the silver slug while in the form of a werewolf. Deeming the Losers a threat, It provides Bowers with a switchblade while manipulating him into murdering his abusive father and recruiting his friends Victor \\"Vic\\" Criss and Reginald \\"Belch\\" Huggins into helping him follow the Losers into the sewers to kill them. But Vic and Belch are both killed by It in the form of Frankenstein's monster while a traumatized Bowers gets himself lost in the sewers. In the sewers, Bill performs the \\"Ritual of Chüd\\" he learned to face It in the Macroverse where he meets the monster's antithesis Maturin, an ancient turtle that created the universe (which it vomited up following a stomach-ache), who explains that It can only be defeated during a battle of wills. Bill enters It's mind through the ritual and sees the true form of It, a mass of destructive orange lights called the \\"Deadlights\\" before Bill defeats the monster with Maturin's help. After the battle, not knowing if they killed It or not, the Losers get lost in the sewers until they take part in an orgy to bring unity back to the group. The Losers then swear a blood oath to return to Derry should It resurface. Bowers, having lost his sanity by the time he washed out of the sewers into a nearby river, is institutionalized after being blamed for the child murders. = 1984–1985 = In July 1984, at the annual Derry carnival, three youths brutally attack a young man named Adrian Mellon and throw him off a bridge. They are arrested and charged with murder when Mellon's mutilated corpse is found. One of the murderers claims that he saw an eccentric clown kill Mellon underneath the bridge. Adrian's boyfriend, Don Hagarty, the other victim in the attack, had also noticed the clown, but the prosecutors convince him not to mention it during the trial. When a string of violent child killings occurs in Derry once again, an adult Mike Hanlon, now the town's librarian and the only one of the Losers to remain in Derry, calls up the six former members of the Losers Club and reminds them of their childhood promise to return should the killings start again. Bill Denbrough is now a successful horror writer living in England with his actress wife, Audra. Beverly Marsh is a fashion designer in Chicago, who has married an abusive man named Tom Rogan, who is similar to her abusive father. Eddie Kaspbrak has moved to New York City, where he runs a limousine rental company and has married a hysterical codependent woman similar to his hypochondriac mother. Richie Tozier lives in Los Angeles and works as a disc jockey. Ben Hanscom is now thin and a successful but lonely architect, living in Nebraska. Stan Uris is a wealthy accountant residing in Atlanta, Georgia, and is married to a teacher named Patty Blum. Prior to Mike's phone calls, all of the Losers had completely forgotten each other and the trauma of their childhood, burying the horror of their encounters with It. However, all but Stan reluctantly agree to return to Derry. After Mike's phone call, Stan is in such fear at the thought of facing It again that he commits suicide by slitting his wrists in the bathtub, writing \\"IT\\" on the wall in his own blood. Tom refuses to let Beverly go and tries to beat her, but she lashes out at him before fleeing, causing him serious injury. The five return to Derry with only the dimmest awareness of why they are doing so, remembering only absolute terror and their promise to return. The Losers meet for lunch in a Chinese restaurant, where Mike reminds them that It awakens once roughly every 27 years for 12–16 months at a time, feeding on children before going into slumber again. The group decides to kill It once and for all. At Mike's suggestion, each person explores different parts of Derry to help restore their memories. While exploring, Eddie, Richie, Beverly, and Ben are faced with manifestations of It (Eddie as Belch Huggins and childhood friends in leper and zombified forms, Richie as a Paul Bunyan statue, Beverly as the witch from Hansel & Gretel in her childhood home, and Ben as Dracula in the Derry Library). Bill finds his childhood bicycle, \\"Silver,\\" and brings it to Mike's. Three other people are also converging on the town: Audra, who is worried about Bill; Tom, who plans to kill Beverly; and Henry Bowers, who has escaped from Juniper Hill Mental Asylum with help from It. Mike and Henry have a violent confrontation at the library. Mike is nearly killed, but Henry escapes, severely injured. Henry is driven to the hotel, where It instructs him to kill the rest of the Losers. Henry first attacks Eddie, breaking his arm once again, but in the fight, Henry is killed. It appears to Tom and orders him to capture Audra. Tom brings Audra to It's lair. Upon seeing It's true form, Audra becomes catatonic, and Tom drops dead in shock. Bill, Ben, Beverly, Richie, and Eddie learn that Mike is near death and realize they are being forced into another confrontation with It. They descend into the sewers and use their strength as a group to \\"send energy\\" to a hospitalized Mike, who fights off a nurse that is under the control of It. They reach It's lair and find It has taken the form of a giant spider. Bill and Richie enter It's mind through the Ritual of Chüd, but they get lost in It. In order to distract It and bring Bill and Richie back, Eddie runs towards It and uses his aspirator to spray medicine in It's eye and down It's throat. Although he is successful, It bites off Eddie's arm, and Eddie dies due to blood loss. It runs away to tend to its injuries, but Bill, Richie, and Ben chase after and find that It has laid eggs. Ben stays behind to destroy the eggs, while Bill and Richie head toward their final confrontation with It. Bill fights his way inside It's body and locates It's heart and destroys it. The group meets up to head out of It's lair, and although they try to bring Audra and Eddie's bodies with them, they are forced to leave Eddie behind. They make it to the surface and realize that the scars on their hands from when they were children have disappeared, indicating that their ordeal is finally over. At the same time, the worst storm in Maine's history sweeps through Derry, and the downtown area collapses. Mike concludes that Derry is finally dying. The Losers return home and gradually begin to forget about It, Derry, and each other. Mike's memory of the events of that summer also begins to fade, as well as any of the records he had written down previously, much to his relief, and he considers starting a new life elsewhere. Ben and Beverly leave together and become a couple, and Richie returns to California. Bill is the last to leave Derry. Before he goes, he takes Audra, still catatonic, for a ride on Silver, which awakens her from her catatonia, and they share a kiss. Development In 1978, King and his family lived in Boulder, Colorado. One evening, King ventured alone to pick up his car from the repair shop and came across an old wooden bridge, \\"humped and oddly quaint\\". Walking along the bridge caused King to recall the story of \\"Three Billy Goats Gruff\\", and the idea of transplanting the tale's scenario into a real-life context interested him. King was further inspired by a line by Marianne Moore—“imaginary gardens with real toads in them\\"—which in his mind came out as \\"real trolls in imaginary gardens.\\" King would return to the concept two years later and gradually accumulated ideas and thoughts, particularly the concept of weaving the narratives of children and the adults they become. King began writing It in 1981, and finished the book four years later. King found influence in the mythology and history surrounding the construction of the sewer system in Bangor, Maine. Themes It thematically focuses on the loss of childhood innocence and questions the difference between necessity and free will. Grady Hendrix of Tor.com described the book as being \\"about the fact that some doors only open one way, and that while there's an exit out of childhood named sex, there’s no door leading the other way that turns adults back into children\\". Christopher Lehman-Haupt of The New York Times noted that It \\"concerns the evil that has haunted America from time to time in the forms of crime, racial and religious bigotry, economic hardship, labor strife and industrial pollution\\", and that the novel's setting \\"is a museum filled with the popular culture of the 1950s: brand names, rock 'n' roll songs and stars, the jokes and routines of childhood in that era\\". James Smythe of The Guardian opined that \\"Pennywise isn't the novel's biggest terror. The most prominent notions of fear in the novel come from the Losers' Club themselves: their home lives, the things that have made them pariahs.\\" Release On December 13, 2011, Cemetery Dance published a special limited edition of It for the 25th anniversary of the novel () in three editions: an unsigned limited gift edition of 2,750, a signed limited edition of 750, and a signed and lettered limited edition of 52. All three editions are oversized hardcovers, housed in a slipcase or traycase, and feature premium binding materials. This anniversary edition features a new dust jacket illustration by Glen Orbik, as well as numerous interior illustrations by Alan M. Clark and Erin Wells. The book also contains a new afterword by Stephen King discussing his reasons for writing the novel. Reception and legacy It received a mixed critical reaction. Lehman-Haupt perceived a lack of justification in Stanley Uris' death and the reunion of the group. Hendrix described the book as \\"by turns boring and shocking\\" and \\"one of King's most frustrating and perplexing books\\", and described the behavior of the child characters as idealized and unnatural. The book's sexual content aroused controversy. Smythe considered the book's descriptions of childhood sexuality to be \\"questionable\\", and was particularly \\"shocked\\" by a scene of the Losers Club engaging in an orgy. However, Hendrix identified this moment as \\"in a sense, the heart of the book\\" and a thematic demonstration of the crossing from childhood to adulthood, and concluded that it is \\"a way for King to tell kids that sex, even unplanned sex, even sex that's kind of weird, even sex where a girl loses her virginity in the sewer, can be powerful and beautiful if the people having it truly respect and like each other\\". The novel has been noted for its exceptional length. Smythe noted that \\"the book is essentially two novels\\", and at \\"fourteen hundred pages long in my printing (the only bigger novel I own is Infinite Jest), and famously weighing nigh-on four pounds, it's a challenge to hold, let alone read\\". Publishers Weekly expressed particular indignation: \\"Overpopulated and under-characterized, bloated by lazy thought- out philosophizing and theologizing there is simply too much of It.\\" The character Pennywise has been named by several outlets as one of the scariest clowns in film or pop culture. In 2003, It was listed at number 144 on the BBC's The Big Read poll—one of three King novels on the list. Adaptations In 1990, the novel was adapted into a television miniseries starring Tim Curry as Pennywise the Clown/It, John Ritter as Ben Hanscom, Harry Anderson as Richie Tozier, Richard Masur as Stan Uris, Tim Reid as Mike Hanlon, Annette O'Toole as Beverly Marsh, Richard Thomas as Bill Denbrough, Olivia Hussey as Audra Phillips, Dennis Christopher as Eddie Kaspbrak, and Michael Cole as Henry Bowers. The younger versions of the characters were played by Brandon Crane (Ben), Seth Green (Richie), Ben Heller (Stan), Marlon Taylor (Mike), Emily Perkins (Beverly), Jonathan Brandis (Bill), Adam Faraizl (Eddie), and Jarred Blancard (Henry). The miniseries was directed by Tommy Lee Wallace and scripted by Wallace and Lawrence D. Cohen. In 1998, the novel was adapted into a television series set in India, starring Lilliput as Pennywise the Clown/Vikram/Woh/It, and Ashutosh Gowarikar (Ashutosh), Mamik Singh (Rahul), Anupam Bhattacharya (Sanjeev), Shreyas Talpade (Young Ashutosh), Parzan Dastur (Young Siddhart), Manoj Joshi (Amit), and Daya Shankar Pandey (Chandu), the series' equivalent of the Losers' Club. The series was directed and written by Glen Baretto and Ankush Mohla. The first of a two-part feature film adaptation, It, was released on September 8, 2017. It is directed by Andy Muschietti, with a screenplay by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman. Instead of a dual narrative, the first film is solely an adaptation of the section that features the characters as children, though the setting has been updated to the late 1980s. It stars Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise and Jaeden Martell as Bill Denbrough.

The second film, It Chapter Two, adapted the \\"adult\\" section and updated the setting to the 2010s, specifically 2016. It starred James McAvoy (Bill), Bill Hader (Richie), Jessica Chastain (Beverly), James Ransone (Eddie), Andy Bean (Stan), Isaiah Mustafa (Mike), and Jay Ryan (Ben). Skarsgård reprised the role of Pennywise and the younger actors returned as well. Principal photography wrapped in 2018, and it was released on September 6, 2019.

Usage The word and term it can be used for either a subject or an object in a sentence and can describe any physical or psychological subject or object. The genitive form its has been used to refer to human babies and animals, although with the passage of time this usage has come to be considered too impersonal in the case of babies, as it may be thought to demean a conscious being to the status of a mere object. This use of it is also criticized when used as a rhetorical device to dehumanize a speaker's enemies, implying that they were little more than animals or objects. The word remains in common use however, and its use increases with the degree to which the speaker views an object of speech as impersonal. For example, a cat or dog is often referred to as it, especially if the dog is not known by the speaker, or if the dog's gender is unknown. However, a person may also say it when referring to his or her own pet. It is often used for idiomatic phrases such as \\"Is it a boy or a girl?\\" Once the gender of a child has been established, the speaker or writer generally switches to gender-specific pronouns. Samuel Taylor Coleridge proposed using it in a wider sense in all the situations where a gender-neutral pronoun might be desired: The children's author E. Nesbit consistently wrote in this manner, often of mixed groups of children: \\"Everyone got its legs kicked or its feet trodden on in the scramble to get out of the carriage.\\"Five Children and It, p. 1. In earlier Middle English, arising from Old English, the pronoun was hit (similar to Dutch het and West Frisian hit with the same meaning), with the unaspirated it being an unaccented form. The genitive was his, with the new form its only arising by analogy in later Middle English. It is used for a thing previously mentioned or easily identified. The pronoun it also serves as a placeholder subject in sentences with no identifiable actor, such as \\"It rained last night\\", \\"It boils down to what you're interested in\\", or the impersonal \\"It was a dark and stormy night\\".

He was a Member of the European Parliament for the Munster constituency from 1994 to 2004. He served as a Teachta Dála for the Limerick West constituency from 1967 to 1997. Early life Collins was born in Abbeyfeale, County Limerick in 1938. The son of James Collins, his father was a former adjutant of the West Limerick Brigade of the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence. He took the republican side during the subsequent Civil War. He was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1948 general election as a Fianna Fáil candidate. Collins was educated locally at St. Ita's College before later attending the Patrician College, Ballyfin. Following the completion of his secondary schooling he attended University College Dublin where he became secretary of the Kevin Barry Cumann of Fianna Fáil. He subsequently worked as a vocational school teacher. Political career Collins first became involved in politics in 1965, when he was appointed assistant general-secretary of Fianna Fáil. Following the death of his father in 1967, he was elected to Dáil Éireann for Limerick West in the subsequent by-election. He was also co-opted onto Limerick County Council and various other local committees. Following Fianna Fáil's re-election at the 1969 general election, Collins secured promotion as a Parliamentary Secretary to George Colley, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Gaeltacht. Here he largely had responsibility for the promotion of Gaeltacht affairs and the Irish language. =Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (1970–73)= In the wake of the Arms Crisis in 1970, a major reshuffle of the cabinet took place. Four ministers, Charles Haughey, Neil Blaney, Kevin Boland and Mícheál Ó Móráin, were either sacked, resigned or retired from the government, due to the scandal that was about to take place. Collins was appointed Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. It was a tough time for Fianna Fáil, as the party nearly faced a split due disagreements over its Northern Ireland policy. Collins, in spite of coming from a strong republican background, remained loyal to Taoiseach Jack Lynch in his moderate approach to the Northern Ireland situation. During his tenure as a Minister, Collins introduced a controversial law which prohibited organisations committed to violence, such as the IRA, from making media broadcasts. On 19 November 1972, an interview with Seán Mac Stíofáin was broadcast on the RTÉ This Week radio programme. Mac Stíofáin was arrested on the same day and the interview was later used as evidence against him on a trial of IRA membership and on 25 November he was sentenced to six months imprisonment by the Special Criminal Court in Dublin. Political fallout arising from the interview was considerable and some days later, Collins sacked the entire RTÉ Authority as he felt that they disobeyed the controversial new law. In 1973, Fianna Fáil were ousted after sixteen years in government, as the National Coalition of Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office. Collins was retained on Jack Lynch's new front bench as spokesperson on Agriculture. After two years in that position he was promoted to spokesperson on Justice in a front bench reshuffle in 1975. In this capacity he was highly critical of the government's management of the Garda Síochána. =Minister for Justice (1977–81)= In defiance of the opinion polls and political commentators Fianna Fáil swept to power with a huge 20-seat Dáil majority following the 1977 general election. Collins, at thirty-eight years of age, was one of the youngest members of Jack Lynch's new cabinet and was appointed Minister for Justice. In spite of the sensitive nature of the portfolio, he was viewed as a safe pair of hands. He had a good working relationship with the Garda Síochána, primarily due to his establishment of the Ryan tribunal, which saw all ranks receive huge pay increases in his first year in office. In December 1979, Jack Lynch resigned as Taoiseach and as Fianna Fáil leader. The succession resulted in a straight contest between Charles Haughey and George Colley. The latter had the backing of the majority of the existing cabinet, including Collins, however, a backbench revolt saw Haughey become Taoiseach. Collins, much to his disappointment, was retained in his existing position as Minister for Justice, holding office until Fianna Fáil lost power following the 1981 general election. =Minister for Foreign Affairs (1982)= The Fine Gael-Labour government was short-lived and Fianna Fáil returned to power, following the February 1982 general election. Collins was rewarded by being named Minister for Foreign Affairs, in Haughey's second cabinet. One of the major incidents of his tenure at Iveagh House was the outbreak of the Falklands War. Although Anglo-Irish relations were at an all-time low, Collins opposed the act of aggression by the Argentinian government at United Nations and EEC levels. The Fianna Fáil government fell in October of that same year and Collins's party were out of power following the November 1982 general election. A period of instability followed within Fianna Fáil as a number of TDs attempted to oust Charles Haughey as party leader. Desmond O'Malley was seen as the clear front- runner to succeed Haughey, however, Collins's name was also mentioned alongside former European Commissioner Michael O'Kennedy. In the end, Haughey survived as party leader, after being told at a meeting of the parliamentary party by Collins that Fianna Fáil had lost credibility due to his continued leadership. In spite of this he was subsequently appointed front bench spokesperson on Foreign Affairs on the new front bench. =Minister for Justice/Foreign Affairs (1987–92)= The results of the 1987 general election saw Fianna Fáil return to power as a minority government. Collins was disappointed to return to his old position as Minister for Justice, preferring instead to take over as Foreign Minister, however, he was once again regarded as a safe pair of hands in a controversial portfolio. Fianna Fáil retained power following the 1989 general election, albeit with the support of the Progressive Democrats in a coalition government. Collins returned to the cabinet in his preferred position as Minister for Foreign Affairs. January 1990, saw him take over as President of the European Community Council of Ministers during Ireland's six-month tenure. This was largely seen as a very successful presidency for the Irish government and was a personal triumph for Collins. In 1991, tensions began to surface within Fianna Fáil regarding the continued leadership of Charles Haughey. Minister for Finance Albert Reynolds was the main challenger, however, he had little support from his cabinet colleagues. In an infamous interview on the Six One News Collins made a plea to Reynolds asking him not to challenge Haughey for the leadership of the Fianna Fáil party: \\"This is going to wreck our party right down the centre and it's going to burst up government\\". The incident was much parodied, particularly by Dermot Morgan later that year. Reynolds's leadership challenge failed on that occasion and Haughey survived. In February 1992, Haughey stepped down as Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader and Reynolds immediately threw his hat in the ring in the leadership contest. Collins contemplated running in the leadership race after a number of approaches from his colleagues, however, in the end he declined to stand. Reynolds won the subsequent leadership election by a large majority. The formation of his new cabinet caused widespread shock as Collins and seven of his cabinet colleagues were effectively sacked in favour of supporters of the new Taoiseach. This effectively brought Collins's domestic career in politics to an end. =Member of the European Parliament (1994–2004)= In 1994, Collins was elected as an MEP for the Munster constituency. He retired from domestic politics at the 1997 general election, being replaced by his brother, Michael J. Collins. Collins was re-elected to the European Parliament in 1999, but lost his bid for another term at the 2004 European Parliament elections. Subsequent to this defeat, he announced his retirement from politics.

Outside Japan, manga usually refers to a Japanese comic book, and mangaka refers to the author of the manga, who is usually Japanese. As of 2006, about 3000 professional mangaka were working in Japan. Most mangaka study at an art college or manga school, or take on an apprenticeship with another artist before entering the industry as a primary creator. More rarely a mangaka breaks into the industry directly, without previously being an assistant. For example, Naoko Takeuchi, author of Sailor Moon, won a contest sponsored by Kodansha, and manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka was first published while studying an unrelated degree, without working as an assistant.(his drawings were in high demand though he hadn't gone to an art school of any type.) A mangaka will rise to prominence through recognition of their ability when they spark the interest of institutions, individuals or a demographic of manga consumers. For example, there are contests which prospective mangaka may enter, sponsored by manga editors and publishers. This can also be accomplished through producing a one-shot. While sometimes a stand-alone manga, with enough positive reception it can be serialized in a weekly, monthly, or quarterly format. They are also recognized for the number of manga they run at any given moment.Schodt, Frederik L.: Manga! Manga!: The World of Japanese Comics, Kodansha International, August 18, 1997, 3rd Asian Cartoon and Art Exhibition : Manga Hai Kya, Comics : Shekhar Gurera Etymology The word can be broken down into two parts: and . The manga corresponds to the medium of art the artist uses: comics, or Japanese comics, depending on how the term is used inside or outside Japan. The -ka (家) suffix implies a degree of expertise and traditional authorship. For example, this term would not be applied to a writer creating a story which is then handed over to a manga artist for drawing. The Japanese term for such a writer of comics is . In a 2010 message from, at the time chairman, Takashi Yanase it says: \\"[w]hile Japan is often said to be world's cartoon kingdom, not a few people will surely be wondering what exactly the Japanese mean by the term 'cartoon'. Unfortunately, there is no hard-and-fast definition that can be offered, since the members of this association lay claim to an extensive variety of works.\\" Relationship to other staff While Japan does have a thriving independent comic market for amateur and semi-professional artists, creating manga professionally is rarely a solo effort. Mangaka must work with an assortment of others to get their work completed, published, and into the hands of readers. =Editor= Most professionally published mangaka work with an editor, who is considered the boss of the mangaka and supervises series production. The editor gives advice on the layout and art of the manga, vets the story direction and pace, ensures that deadlines are met, and generally makes sure that the manga stays up to company standards. Naoki Urasawa compared the relationship between a mangaka and their editor to that of the one between a music producer and a recording artist, specifically citing George Martin's relationship with The Beatles. The editor may also function as a brand manager and publicist for a series. When a manga is the basis for a media franchise, the editor may also supervise the designs for licensed merchandise, anime adaptations, and similar products, though this duty may also fall to the mangaka or an agent. An example of a mangaka and their editor is Akira Toriyama and Kazuhiko Torishima. =Writer= A mangaka may both write and illustrate a series of their own creation, or may work together with an author. The mangaka typically has a strong influence on dialog even when paired with a writer, as any conversation must fit within the physical constraints imposed by the art. Takeshi Obata of Death Note, Tetsuo Hara of Fist of the North Star, Ryoichi Ikegami of Sanctuary, Aki Shirou and Hajime Kamoshida of Sakura-sō no Pet na Kanojo are all successful manga artists who have worked with writers through the majority of their careers. =Assistants= Most mangaka have assistants who help them complete their work in a clean and timely manner. The duties of assistants vary widely, as the term incorporates all people working for a mangaka's art studio, but is most commonly used to refer to secondary artists. The number of assistant artists also varies widely between mangaka, but is typically at least three. Other mangaka instead form work groups known as \\"circles\\" but do not use additional assistants, such as the creative team CLAMP. A few mangaka have no assistants at all, and prefer to do everything themselves, but this is considered exceptional. Assistants are commonly used for inking, lettering, and shading, though the predominance of black and white art in manga means that unlike in the western comic industry, a studio rarely employs a colorist. Some mangaka only do the sketchwork for their art, and have their numerous assistants fill in all of the details, but it is more common for assistants to deal with background and cameo art, leaving the mangaka to focus on drawing and inking the characters. Assistants may also be employed to perform specialized artistic tasks. Go Nagai, for instance, at one time employed a specialist to draw helicopters and other military vehicles, Kaoru Mori employed a historical consultant for Emma, and series that incorporates photorealistic architecture, animals, computer-rendered imagery, or other technically demanding effects may employ or contract separate artists trained in those techniques. Assistants almost never help the mangaka with the plot of their manga, beyond being a sounding board for ideas. A mangaka's assistants might be listed in the credits for a manga tankōbon, and short interviews with or illustrations by assistant artists are a common form of bonus material in these collections, but they typically do not receive individual credits. Most mangaka started out as assistants, such as Miwa Ueda to Naoko Takeuchi, Leiji Matsumoto to Osamu Tezuka, Kaoru Shintani to Leiji Matsumoto, and Eiichiro Oda, Hiroyuki Takei and Mikio Itō to Nobuhiro Watsuki, who was himself an assistant to Takeshi Obata. It is also possible for an assistant to have an entire career as such without becoming an independent mangaka. Assistants, particularly specialists, may work with several different mangaka at the same time, and many assistants also self-publish works of their own in the dōjinshi scene.

It was written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers. The first book of the Conversations with God series, Conversations with God, Book 1: An Uncommon Dialogue, was published in 1995 and became a publishing phenomenon, staying on The New York Times Best Sellers List for 137 weeks. The succeeding volumes in the ten book series also appeared prominently on the List. In an interview with Larry King, Walsch described the inception of the books as follows: at a low period in his life, Walsch wrote an angry letter to God asking questions about why his life wasn't working. After writing down all of his questions, he heard a voice over his right shoulder say: \\"Do you really want an answer to all these questions or are you just venting?\\"Neale Donald Walsch on CNS's Larry King Live (April 7th, 2000) Though when he turned around he saw no one there, Walsch felt answers to his questions filling his mind and decided to write them down. The ensuing dialogue became the Conversations with God books. When asked in a recent interview how does he ‘open up’ to God these days, Neale stated “I am reaching out to touch others with this information. When I reach out and touch others with this information I reconnect immediately with the divine presence.” 'Being at One': Neale Donald Walsch Interview with Gil Dekel, PhD (Part 1 of 3), Paragraph 16  Basis of the dialogue  Containing nearly 3,000 pages of material in total, the series presents a large number of ideas. The second and third books in the original trilogy deal with political and social issues. = CwG's basic messages = In Friendship with God, Walsch writes that God presents four concepts which are central to the entire dialogue: # We are all one. # There's enough. # There's nothing we have to do. # Ours is not a better way, ours is merely another way. Existence is essentially non-dual in nature. At the highest level there is no separation between anything and there is only one of us; there is only God, and everything is God. The second statement, following from the first, means that we, in this seeming existence, lack nothing and if we choose to realize it, we have enough of whatever we think we need (or the means to create it) within us. The third statement combines the first two to conclude that God, being all there is and is thus always sufficient unto Itself, has no need of anything and therefore has no requirements of humanity. The final concept puts an end to our need to always be right. Given that we have and are everything, and there's nothing we have to do, there are an infinite number of ways to experience this, not just the one way we may have chosen so far. According to the books, God recommends many economic and social changes if people want to make a more functional, adaptable, and sustainable world, it recommends that more attention should focus on the environment. The conversations also speak of reincarnation and the existence of life on other planets. = God's motive for creation = In Walsch's first dialogue, God notes that \\"knowing\\" and \\"experiencing\\" oneself are different things. Before creation, there was only That-Which-Is, which cannot know or experience itself fully, without something it is not. It cannot know itself as love, since nothing exists but love. It cannot know itself as giving since nothing else exists to give to. It cannot experience itself in myriad ways because everything is one. This present creation then, in Walsch's viewpoint, is established by and within God, so that sentience can exist which does not directly remember its true nature as God. Split into infinite forms, all life can live, experience, and recreate its nature as God, rather than just \\"know\\" itself as the creator in theory. It is essentially a game, entered into by agreement, to remember who and what we are and enjoy and create, knowing that ultimately there is no finish line that some will not reach, no understanding that is not without value, no act that does not add meaning to the future or for others. Walsch claims that God says that we have a common interest in keeping the game going, for there is nothing else to do except to experience our existence and then experience more of it, to uncover deeper layers of truth and understanding. There are no external rules, because all experience is subjective, and is chosen. But within this, there are ways that (it is stated and implied) people will gradually come to see their thoughts, words, and actions are either working or not working. A thing is either functional or dysfunctional, not right or wrong. These rememberings take place over \\"time\\" and can take hundreds and thousands of lifetimes. = Nature of the dialogue = * Book 1 (pg. 4) argues that words are not the ultimate truth, rather words are symbols, and are open to interpretations. Thus the readers are advised to consult their own inner knowing or intuition to determine their own truth while reading the book, or any other book. Though the books bear the title Conversations with God and the author states in book 1 that he is \\"taking dictation\\" from God, the 'dialogue' is said to be between God and all people at all times. The question, according to Neale, is not to whom does God talk, but who listens. This is clarified by the statement that God can communicate with people in many ways (the next song you hear, the next sunset you experience, the next time you hear laughter, the next movie that really moves you), and not necessarily through words 'spoken' by God to a person. \\"All these devices are mine. All these avenues are open to me. I will speak to you if you invite me.\\" (Book 1, pg. 58). * Jesus is said to have sought to lead by example, which is why he said, \\"I am the way and the life, follow me\\". Follow me meant that we should follow his example and become one with God - Jesus and other living things are/were not one with God presently (everything is happening right now with no space/time difference) - rather than become his followers. Jesus is supposed to have said, \\"I and the Father (God) are one and you are my brethren\\". This means that living things are all one (particles of the collective God) (Book 3, Chapter20, pgs. 329-330). * Jesus is said to have said, \\"without the father (God), I am nothing\\". The father of all is pure thought which is the energy of life (Book 3, Chapter11, pg. 180). * In Book 3 of Conversations with God (1998), by Neale Donald Walsch, it is mentioned that Mahavatar Babaji may at one time have resurrected himself from the dead, just like Lazarus, Jesus and other humans.Walsch, Neale Donald, Conversations with God: an uncommon dialog (Book #3), page 95. When Neale asks God if reincarnation is a false doctrine, God replies that it is not. Neale then asks why some religions do not know the truth about something so basic. In response, God says that we must understand that humans have many fear based religions whose teachings surround the doctrine of a God who is to be worshipped and feared. It was through fear that the entire Earth society reformed itself from a matriarchy into a patriarchy. * It was through fear that the holy priests got people to mend their wicked ways and heed the word of the Lord. It was through fear that the churches gained and controlled their membership. Churches even insisted that God will punish you if you did not go to church every Sunday, not going to church was declared a sin - and not just any church. * One had to attend one particular church - if you went to a church of a different denomination that too was a sin. That was an attempt at control, pure and simple, using fear. The amazing thing is it worked. People will always believe in hell and in a God who would send them there as long as we believe that God is like man -- ruthless, self-serving, unforgiving and vengeful. * In the past, most people could not imagine a God who might rise above all of that so they accepted the teachings of many churches to fear the terrible vengeance of the Lord. It was as if people could not trust themselves to be good and act appropriately, on their own by their own built in reasons. So they had to create a religion that taught the doctrine of an angry, retributive God in order to keep themselves in line. The idea of reincarnation threw a monkey wrench into all of that. The church was proclaiming that you better be nice or else--and along came the reincarnationists saying you have another chance after this and another chance after that and still more chances, so don't worry. Do the best you can. Don't become so paralysed with fear that you can't budge. Promise yourself to do better and get on with it. Naturally, the early Church couldn't hear of such a thing that did two things. First, it denounced the doctrine of reincarnation as heretical, then it created the sacrament of confession. Confession could do for the Church goer what reincarnation promised. That is, give him another chance. There was a catch however - this absolution could not come directly from God, it had to flow through the church whose priests pronounced penances which had to be performed. These were usually prayers which were required of the sinner. So now you had two reasons to keep up church membership. The church found confession to be such a good drawing card that soon it declared to be a sin not to go to confession. Everybody had to do it at least once a year. If they didn't, God would have another reason to be angry. More and more rules - many of them arbitrary and capricious - began to be promulgated by the church, each rule having the power of God's eternal condemnation behind it, unless, of course, failure was confessed and then the person was forgiven by God and condemnation avoided. That led to another problem. People figured out that this must mean they could do anything as long as they confessed it. The church was in a quandary. Fear had left the hearts of the people. Church attendance and membership dropped. People came to confess once a year, said their penances, were absolved of their sins and went on with their lives. There was no question about it. A way had to be found to strike fear into the heart again, so purgatory was invented. Purgatory was described as a place something like hell, but not eternal. This new doctrine declared that God would make you suffer for your sins even if you confessed them. Under the doctrine, a certain amount of suffering was decreed by God for each nonperfect soul, based on the number and type of sins committed. There were mortal sins and venial sins. Mortal sins would send you right to hell if not confessed before death. Once more, Church attendance shot up, collections were up, too and especially contributions--for the doctrine of purgatory could buy one's way out of the suffering. According to the church's teaching, one could receive a special indulgence but not directly from God - only from an official of the church. These special indulgences freed one from the suffering in purgatory which they had earned with their sins or at least part of it. These reprieves were granted to very few like those who made a huge contribution to the church. For a really huge sum, one could obtain a plenary indulgence. This meant no time in purgatory at all - it was a non-stop ticket straight to heaven. This special favor from God was available for even fewer. Royalty, perhaps and the super rich. The amount of money, jewels and land given to the church in exchange for these plenary indulgences was enormous. The exclusivity of this brought great frustration and resentment to the masses. The poorest peasant had no hope of gaining a bishop's indulgence and so the rank and file lost faith in the system with attendance threatening to drop once again. Then they brought in the novena candles. People could come to the church and light a novena candle for the poor souls in purgatory and by saying a novena (a series of prayers in a particular order that took some time to complete), they could reduce by many years the sentence of the dearly departed, extricating them from purgatory sooner than God would otherwise have allowed. They couldn't do anything for themselves but at least they could pray for mercy for the departed. Of course, it would be helpful if a coin or two were dropped through the slot for each candle lit. A lot of little candles were flickering behind a lot of red glass and a lot of pesos and pennies were being dropped into a lot of tin boxes in an attempt to get God to ease up on the suffering being inflicted on the souls in purgatory (Book 3, Chapter7, pgs. 126-130).  Parallels in other belief systems  In the dialogue many philosophical ideas are presented that had already been advanced earlier by major Eastern and Western thinkers, but Walsch presents the information in language for modern readers and does not specifically cite any of these philosophers. In fact, Walsch claims that he had never known most of these ideas before his revelatory experiences. Since the beginning of the series, and especially in the latter volumes, Walsch and \\"God\\" acknowledge that most of the concepts presented are previously known to humanity, but are profound enough to warrant being explored repeatedly, and put into this cohesive unified form. Since humanity is still mired in strife and conflict, there is value in their restatement. Fundamental parts of Walsch's writings are also mirrored within other well known spiritual writings and traditions: * All things are one, there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one, and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator. (The Law of One/Advaita/Sikhism) * Souls reincarnate to eventually experience God- realization (Hinduism/' 'Bhagavad-Gita/Sikhism ). * Feelings are more important as a source of guidance than intellect (Rousseau/Sikhism). * We are not here to learn anything new but to remember what we already know (Hinduism/Plato/Sikhism). * Physical reality is an illusion (Hinduism/ Buddhism's concept of maya/Sikhism). * One cannot understand one thing unless he or she understands its opposite (Tao Te Ching). * God is everything. (Hinduism / Spinoza / Brahman/Sikhism) * God is self-experiential, in that it is the nature of the Universe to experience itself. (Hinduism/Hegel/Sikhism, and process theology as first outlined by Alfred North Whitehead) * God is not fear-inducing or vengeful, only our parental projections onto God are. (Sikhism) * Fear or love are the two basic alternative perspectives on life. 'Inspiration: a functional approach to creative practice', Paragraph 2 (Drewermann) * Good and evil do not exist (as absolutes, but can exist in a different context and for different reasons). (Nietzsche/Sikhism) * Reality is a representation created by will. (Schopenhauer/Sikhism) * Nobody knowingly desires evil. (Socrates/Stoicism/Sikhism) (see: Moral intellectualism ) Bibliography = Complete Title List of All CWG BooksConversations with God: Awaken the Species (Book 4) (2017) , pp. 286–288= Dialogue Books series The following are the ten books in the Conversations With God Dialogue Books series.

The trophy is named in honor of NFL coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowl games. History During lunch with NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle in 1966, Tiffany & Co. vice president Oscar Riedner made a sketch on a cocktail napkin of what would become the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The original trophy was produced by Tiffany & Co. in Newark, New Jersey. Others have since been handcrafted by the company in Parsippany, New Jersey. As of 2017, the trophy is produced at the Tiffany & Co Forrest Hills manufacturing facility in Cumberland, Rhode Island. The trophy was first awarded to the Green Bay Packers after they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 35–10 to win Super Bowl I on January 15, 1967. Even though it is a national tournament, the award was initially inscribed with the words \\"World Professional Football Championship\\". It was officially renamed in 1970 in memory of NFL head coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowl games, after his death from cancer. It was thus presented for the first time as the Vince Lombardi Trophy in Super Bowl V when the Baltimore Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys 16–13. It has also been referred to as the \\"Tiffany Trophy\\" after Tiffany & Co. Since Super Bowl XXX, the award has been presented to the winning team's owner on the field following the game. Previously, it was presented inside the winning team's locker room. In the case of the community-owned Packers' two titles since Super Bowl XXX, the team's President & CEO (Bob Harlan in Super Bowl XXXI and Mark Murphy in Super Bowl XLV) has accepted the trophy. Unlike trophies such as the Stanley Cup and the Grey Cup, a new Vince Lombardi Trophy is made every year and the winning team maintains permanent possession of that trophy, with one notable exception being Super Bowl V's, won by the then-Baltimore Colts. The city of Baltimore retained that trophy as part of the legal settlement between the team and the city after the Colts' infamous \\"Midnight Mayflower\\" relocation to Indianapolis, Indiana on March 29, 1984. Since then, both the relocated Colts and their replacement in Baltimore, the Ravens, have won the Super Bowl and earned trophies in their own right. Since Super Bowl XLV, the Vince Lombardi Trophy is also prominently featured in the standardized logo design now used for all future Super Bowl games. Appearance The Vince Lombardi Trophy stands tall, weighs and depicts a football in a kicking position on a three concave sided stand, and is entirely made of sterling silver. The words \\"Vince Lombardi Trophy\\" along with the Roman numerals of that year's Super Bowl are engraved on and the NFL shield is affixed onto the base. After the trophy is awarded, it is sent back to Tiffany's to be engraved with the names of the participating teams, the date, location, and the game's final score. It is then sent back to the winning team for them to keep. Smaller replicas are made for each person on the winning team. For the first four championship games, both the NFL and the AFL logos were in the center of the trophy. Starting from Super Bowl V, only the NFL shield was on the front. Beginning with Super Bowl XXXVIII, the shield took on a frosted appearance. Starting with Super Bowl XLIII, the slightly redesigned NFL shield began appearing on the trophy, still with a frosted appearance. Other than the logo, the trophy has had no significant changes made since the first Super Bowl. While no franchise possesses all four versions, the Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, New York Giants, and Pittsburgh Steelers have three of the four designs.Former New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski using the trophy as a bat (left), and the baseball-sized dent left after, April 2019 =Rob Gronkowski denting incident= On April 9, 2019, Rob Gronkowski (who had retired from the New England Patriots two weeks before) used the Super Bowl LIII Vince Lombardi trophy as a bat to bunt a practice pitch from wide receiver Julian Edelman during the Boston Red Sox season opener where he was to throw the ceremonial first pitch with his former teammates. It left a baseball-sized dent in Gronkowski's last championship trophy– his third overall– and his former team's sixth. The humorous documentary-style video released by the Patriots about the incident became popular, with special teamer Matthew Slater, who witnessed the incident first hand, saying that if anyone can get away with it, it would be the \\"[Super Bowl] MVP (Edelman) and the future Hall of Famer (Gronkowski).\\" Patriots vice president of media relations Stacey James stated that \\"Maybe they’ll [organization] fix it down the road. That’s something they can always fix in the future, but at least for now, we’re going to keep the dent and tell the story.\\" Teams with the most Vince Lombardi Trophies The Super Bowl is currently played in early February (the game originally took place in early to mid-January), culminating a regular season that generally begins in September of the previous calendar year. For example, Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, determined the league champion for the 2015 NFL season. The years shown below refer to the season, not the date that the Super Bowl was actually played. Former US President left The Pittsburgh Steelers (1974, 1975, 1978, 1979, 2005, 2008) are tied with the New England Patriots (2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, 2018) with six Vince Lombardi Trophies. The Dallas Cowboys (1971, 1977, 1992, 1993, 1995) and the San Francisco 49ers (1981, 1984, 1988, 1989, 1994) are tied for third with 5 each. The Green Bay Packers (1966, 1967, 1996, 2010) and the New York Giants (1986, 1990, 2007, 2011) are tied for fifth with four each. The Oakland Raiders (1976, 1980, 1983), the Washington Football Team (1982, 1987, 1991) and the Denver Broncos (1997, 1998, 2015) are tied for seventh with three each. Although none of these teams have ever won three straight Super Bowls, two teams have won three Lombardi trophies in four years and one team twice won the trophy two out of three consecutive years: The Dallas Cowboys (1992, 1993, 1995) and the New England Patriots (2001, 2003, 2004) and (2014, 2016) and (2016, 2018). The Pittsburgh Steelers won four Super Bowls in six years (1974, 1975, 1978, 1979). Presentation ceremony The trophy has been presented on a stage constructed on the field since Super Bowl XXX in 1996. A personality from the TV network broadcasting the game handles the presentation ceremony. Traditionally this has been Terry Bradshaw, a four-time Super Bowl champion with the Pittsburgh Steelers when the game is televised on FOX, the first being Super Bowl XXXI (except Super Bowl XLVIII, when Bradshaw had to return to his native Louisiana the day before the game after a death in his family; Michael Strahan substituted for Bradshaw. This change allowed Strahan to present the trophy at MetLife Stadium, the successor to Giants Stadium, where Strahan spent the entirety of his 15-year Hall of Fame career with the New York Giants). Jim Nantz has handled the duties for CBS since becoming the network's lead NFL play-by-play voice, beginning with Super Bowl XLI. The commissioner, winning owner, winning coach, winning quarterback, and-if not a QB-the MVP, are usually recognized. The Lombardi Trophy Theme, composed by David Robidoux in 2005, plays during the trophy hand-off. From Super Bowl XXX to Super Bowl XXXIX and Super Bowl LIV, the trophy was set on the stage to begin the ceremony. From Super Bowl XL to Super Bowl LIII, a former NFL player, usually a past Super Bowl MVP or notable figure of the host city's franchise, brings the Lombardi Trophy to the center of the stadium, as he walks past members of the winning team. Joe Namath has participated in the most Lombardi Trophy hand-off ceremonies with three appearances. The players, along with the Super Bowls in which they participated in the Lombardi Trophy presentation ceremony, are listed below. * Super Bowl XL Presentation – Bart Starr (MVP, Super Bowl I and Super Bowl II) * Super Bowl XLI Presentation – Don Shula (former Miami Dolphins head coach) * Super Bowl XLII Presentation – Doug Williams (MVP, Super Bowl XXII) * Super Bowl XLIII Presentation – Joe Namath (MVP, Super Bowl III) * Super Bowl XLIV Presentation – Len Dawson (MVP, Super Bowl IV) * Super Bowl XLV Presentation – Roger Staubach (former Dallas Cowboys quarterback and MVP, Super Bowl VI) * Super Bowl XLVI Presentation – Raymond Berry (former Baltimore Colts split end; coached New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX) * Super Bowl XLVII Presentation – Richard Dent (MVP, Super Bowl XX, played in New Orleans) * Super Bowl XLVIII Presentation – Marcus Allen (MVP, Super Bowl XVIII) * Super Bowl XLIX Presentation – Kurt Warner (former Arizona Cardinals quarterback and MVP, Super Bowl XXXIV) * Super Bowl 50 Presentation – Terrell Davis (MVP, Super Bowl XXXII), who handed it to Namath, who handed it to Lynn Swann (MVP, Super Bowl X) * Super Bowl LI Presentation – Willie McGinest (former New England Patriots linebacker), who handed it to Michael Strahan (former New York Giants defensive end). * Super Bowl LII Presentation – Darrell Green (former Washington Redskins cornerback, Super Bowl XVIII, Super Bowl XXII, Super Bowl XXVI (played in Minneapolis)) * Super Bowl LIII Presentation – Vince Wilfork (former New England Patriots nose tackle), who handed it to Emmitt Smith (MVP, Super Bowl XXVIII (played in Atlanta)), who handed it to Namath.

Career Rodgers was born in Ballymena and began her professional singing career at 13 when she opened for Michael Holliday. Her father, a dancehall tour promoter, helped her sign with Decca in 1962, where her earliest singles were produced by Shel Talmy. She made four singles before moving to EMI's Columbia label in 1965, where 'Cloda Rogers' made the 1966 single \\"Stormy Weather\\"/\\"Lonely Room\\".Sleeve notes, Backcomb 'n' Beat: Dream Babes Volume Three (RPM CD, 2001) Although none of her Decca or Columbia singles made the UK Singles Chart, Rodgers became a regular face on British television and appeared in the musical films Just for Fun (1963) and It's All Over Town (1964). She also appeared in various song festivals, finishing third in the European Song Cup competition in Greece with \\"Powder Your Face With Sunshine\\". In November 1963 she flew to Nashville, Tennessee at the invitation of the American singer Jim Reeves, to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. On his Irish tour earlier that year he had recognised that Rodgers was a promising artist with a bright future. Rodgers appeared with Honeybus on BBC Two's music programme Colour Me Pop on 12 October 1968. Her career changed dramatically when she married John Morris, who became her manager. She signed a three-single deal with RCA in 1968, but the first two failed to chart. When producer and songwriter Kenny Young saw her on Colour Me Pop he telephoned the BBC to find out who she was. Clodagh Rodgers finally shot to fame in 1969 under his creative wing and with Morris' management (Morris also later managed The Rubettes, Kenny and Fox),Wilde, Diana: The Glam Rock Files. Independent September 2017. . Pages 62-63 \\"Come Back and Shake Me\\" and \\"Goodnight Midnight\\" both were Top 5 hits and made her the best-selling female singles artist of 1969. Also, she won 'The Best Legs' in British showbusiness and insured her voice for one million pounds. Her next two single releases \\"Biljo\\" and \\"Everybody Go Home, The Party's Over\\", were less successful. Neither broke the top 20 and the latter failed to reach the top 40. Her next single, \\"Tangerines, Tangerines\\" in January 1970 didn't chart at all, despite heavy television promotion on such highly popular shows as The Morecambe & Wise Show, Frost On Sunday and The Des O'Connor Show. The single was re-released in April 1970 with the B-Side track \\"Wolf\\" promoted as the A-Side, but it still failed to chart. Young wrote and produced many of these songs. She also recorded \\"Scrapbook,\\" penned by Billy Ritchie, which appeared on her 1969 album Midnight Clodagh. In 1970 she recorded \\"Give Me Just a Little More Line\\" with Young under the name Moonshine; though it enjoyed moderate success, it failed to chart. Rodgers picked this track as one of her eight favourite discs when she appeared as the featured castaway on the BBC's Desert Island Discs in March 1971. In May 1970 Rodgers appeared on the bill at the NME poll-winner's concert, hosted by Tony Blackburn and Jimmy Savile. =Eurovision= By this time Rodgers had become a TV star and household name. In 1970 she was asked to represent the UK in the 1971 Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin. According to John Kennedy O'Connor's The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History, part of the reasoning behind the BBC's invitation was their concern over the reaction the UK entrant would get on the stage from the Irish public. As a Catholic Northern Irishwoman, she received death threats from the IRA, who regarded her as a traitor, as a result of her appearing for the UK.O'Connor, John Kennedy. (2007) The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History. London: Carlton. . Heralded by two separate front-cover features on the BBC listing's magazine, the Radio Times, Rodgers appeared as the resident guest on It's Cliff Richard, a prime-time variety show hosted by Cliff Richard on BBC One from January 1971, performing one shortlisted song a week for six weeks, followed by a performance of all six on week seven and with a repeat of the six songs immediately after. Viewers would normally have been asked to send in postcard votes for their favourites, but because of a postal strike, regional juries decided the winner, with \\"Jack in the Box\\", written by John Worsley and David Myers, being named the winner the following week. For the first time in the Eurovision Song Contest, broadcasters were required to prepare a 'preview' video of the song for broadcast in all the participating Eurovision countries to help promote the songs before the big night. For the performance in Dublin, Rodgers wore a pink frilly top and spangled hot pants. She finished in fourth place, behind Monaco, Spain and Germany. It was the first time since 1966 that the UK had not placed first or second. After Eurovision, the single reached number 4 on the UK Singles Chart, her third and last UK Top 10 success. It remains her most famous hit. At Eurovision, Rodgers' sister Lavinia joined The Breakaways as her four backing vocalists. In 1982, Lavinia and brother Louis attempted to represent the UK in the contest as part of the group 'Good Looks', but failed to come through the UK heat. At the time she featured in an advert for Bisto Gravy along with her first husband. =Post-Eurovision career= Rodgers admitted to Ken Bruce during his eponymous BBC Radio 2 show in an interview broadcast on Friday, 25 May 2012, that the intention had been to release Another Time, Another Place, which had placed fourth of the six entries in the Song for Europe contest as the follow up single to Jack in the Box and she began promoting it whilst in Dublin for the Eurovision final. However, Engelbert Humperdinck released a cover version before her track was available, denying her the opportunity to release it, but gaining himself a No.13 hit single. Despite only one more chart single, \\"Lady Love Bug\\" in autumn 1971, Rodgers continued to be a major TV star in the UK, guesting on many shows (including playing herself in the BBC sitcom Whack-O!), appearing in cabaret, and becoming the face of 'Bisto' in a series of television advertisements. On Irish television, The Clodagh Rodgers Show won an award at the Golden Rose TV festival in Montreux. She starred in many other shows, including Sunday Night at the London Palladium in 1974, singing three songs, including her latest single \\"Get It Together\\". Rodgers also appeared in Seaside Special for BBC Television in 1975 and The Morecambe and Wise Show in 1970. She was a regular guest of The Two Ronnies. In August 1973, Rodgers hosted the first edition of BBC2's Show Of The Week: The Young Generation Big Top, the forerunner of the later BBC1 series Seaside Special. Rodgers also made a mark with her impressions of fellow artists such as Cilla Black, often working with Mike Yarwood, Des O'Connor, Tommy Cooper, Bob Monkhouse, and Dickie Henderson in variety. She was a regular performer in UK resorts' summer seasons, sharing the bill with Mike and Bernie Winters, among others. This success was mirrored on stage, where she has starred in London's West End in her own show at the Talk of the Town (breaking Sammy Davis Jr.'s box office record) and in Cinderella at the London Palladium in 1971. Her stage career was damaged when she walked out on the show Meet Me in London at London's Adelphi Theatre in April 1971. The show, a fixed 10-week fill-in between the closure of the musical Charlie Girl and a new production of Showboat, was produced by Harold Fielding, and consisted of two halves. Clodagh was due to feature in the opening half, mainly with the 30-strong singing and dancing group, The Young Generation, with two interspersed spots, one with comics Hope and Keen, the other some songs from Rodgers. The second half was a Tommy Steele-centred spectacular that had originally been played in Las Vegas. After cuts to the running order to trim the show's length, Rodgers and her manager/husband walked out 15 minutes before curtain-up on opening night. Hope and Keen filled in for her and after a few shows singer Susan Maughan took over her spot. Despite this, Rodgers continued with TV work through the late 1970s. As part of BBC1's celebration of the UK and Ireland both joining the European Economic Community on January 1, 1973, Clodagh appeared on Top Of The Year on December 31, 1972, alongside Bruce Forsyth and with Jimmy Tarbuck in The Tarbuck Follies on January 1, 1973 to see in the new year. Having been dropped by RCA in early 1974, Clodagh released just one single for the Pye label, \\"Saturday Sunday\\" later that year. She signed to Polydor Records in 1976. Despite extensive radio airplay and television appearances, her 1977 single \\"Save Me\\" failed to chart. The track was covered in the US by Louise Mandrell who took it to number six on the US country chart in 1983. \\"Save Me\\" was also covered by the South African all-female band Clout (an SA no. 7 hit in 1979). Other artists who covered this song include Merrilee Rush and Helen Reddy. The failure of the Polydor album or any of the singles issued from it to reach the UK charts led to the label dropping her in 1978. In 1978, Rodgers hosted UK ITV's St. Patrick's Day variety show for the second time, appearing on the cover of the TVTimes to promote the show. Later that year, Rodgers teamed with Terry Wogan on the ITV game show 3-2-1 in the programme's first Christmas Special Celebrity edition, and the pair became the first contestants (celebrity or otherwise) to end up with the 'Dustbin' as their prize, losing the chance to attain a prize for their nominated charity. She split from her manager/husband not long after their son's birth and opted for motherhood over performing, although she released two singles on the Precision label in 1980. One of these tracks was \\"My Simple Heart,\\" which was placed on a B-side. Shortly after its release, The Three Degrees released their version of it, which reached the UK Top 10. Similarly, Rodgers had released \\"Stand by Your Man\\" as the B-side of her 1971 single \\"Lady Love Bug.\\" \\"Stand by Your Man\\" (co-written by Tammy Wynette and Billy Sherrill) had previously been a hit for Tammy Wynette in the U.S. Country charts in 1968 and later a number one hit single for Wynette when it was released the UK in 1975. Later years Her second husband, guitarist Ian Sorbie, died in 1995, not long after their Paignton-based restaurant business collapsed, leaving them bankrupt. She has appeared in two musicals in the West End. These are Pump Boys and Dinettes at the Piccadilly and Albery Theatres and in the lead role of Mrs Johnstone in the long-running hit Blood Brothers at the Phoenix Theatre. She appeared in the UK tour of Blood Brothers between 1995 and 1998. In 1996, the first of two CD retrospectives were issued, bringing Rodgers back into the limelight. In 1998, she made a rare TV appearance with other former Eurovision artists such as Johnny Logan and Lynsey de Paul, performing on comedian John Shuttleworth's Eurovision parody Europigeon on BBC Two, just before the 1998 contest in Birmingham. In 1999, Mint Royale issued the track \\"Shake Me,\\" which sampled Rodgers' original recording of \\"Come Back And Shake Me\\"; it was featured in the UK TV production Queer As Folk. In 2001, Rodgers played a recurring character in the ITV drama series The Bill. She retired from the music business in 2015 at the age of 68.

A member of the Democratic Party, he was an architect and champion of westward expansion by the United States, a cause that became known as Manifest Destiny. Benton served in the Senate from 1821 to 1851, becoming the first member of that body to serve five terms. Benton was born in Harts Mill, Orange County, North Carolina. After graduating from the University of North Carolina, he established a law practice and plantation near Nashville, Tennessee. He served as an aide to General Andrew Jackson during the War of 1812 and settled in St. Louis, Missouri, after the war. Missouri became a state in 1821 and Benton won election as one of its inaugural pair of United States Senators. The Democratic-Republican Party fractured after 1824 and Benton became a Democratic leader in the Senate, serving as an important ally of President Jackson and President Martin Van Buren. He supported Jackson during the Bank War and proposed a land payment law that inspired Jackson's Specie Circular executive order. Benton's prime concern was the westward expansion of the United States. He called for the annexation of the Republic of Texas, which was accomplished in 1845. He pushed for compromise in the partition of Oregon Country with the British and supported the 1846 Oregon Treaty, which divided the territory along the 49th parallel. He also authored the first Homestead Act, which granted land to settlers willing to farm it. Though he owned slaves, Benton came to oppose the institution of slavery after the Mexican–American War, and he opposed the Compromise of 1850 as too favorable to pro-slavery interests. This stance damaged Benton's popularity in Missouri, and the state legislature denied him re-election in 1851. Benton won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1852 but was defeated for re-election in 1854 after he opposed the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Benton's son-in-law, John C. Frémont, won the 1856 Republican Party nomination for president, but Benton voted for James Buchanan and remained a loyal Democrat until his death in 1858. Early life Thomas Hart Benton was born in Harts Mill, North Carolina, near the present- day town of Hillsborough. His father Jesse Benton, a wealthy lawyer and landowner, died in 1790. His grandfather Samuel Bentonhttp://mostateparks.com/page/55154/benton-genealogy (c. 1720–1770) was born in Worcester, England, and settled in the Province of North Carolina. Thomas H. Benton also studied law at the University of North Carolina where he was a member of the Philanthropic Society, but in 1799 he was dismissed from school after admitting to stealing money from fellow students. As Benton was leaving campus on the day he was expelled, he turned to the students who were jeering him and said, \\"I am leaving here now but damn you, you will hear from me again.\\" He then left school to manage the Benton family estate, but historians posit that Benton used the events as motivation to prove himself worthy in adulthood. Attracted by the opportunities in the West, the young Benton moved the family to a 40,000 acre (160 km²) holding near Nashville, Tennessee. Here he established a plantation with accompanying schools, churches, and mills. His experience as a pioneer instilled a devotion to Jeffersonian democracy which continued through his political career. He continued his legal education and was admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1805, and in 1809 served a term as state senator.Morrow, 261. He attracted the attention of Tennessee's \\"first citizen\\" Andrew Jackson, under whose tutelage he remained during the Tennessee years. At the outbreak of the War of 1812, Jackson made Benton his aide-de-camp, with a commission as a lieutenant colonel. Benton was assigned to represent Jackson's interests to military officials in Washington D.C.; he chafed under the position, which denied him combat experience. In 1813 Benton engaged in a frontier brawl with Jackson in which Jackson was wounded.Meacham, Jon. American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House. New York: Random House, 2009 (29–30). After the war, in 1815, Benton moved his estate to the newly opened Missouri Territory. As a Tennessean, he was under Jackson's shadow; in Missouri, he could be a big fish in the as-yet small pond. He settled in St. Louis, where he practiced law and edited the Missouri Enquirer, the second major newspaper west of the Mississippi River. In 1817 during a court case he and opposing attorney Charles Lucas accused each other of lying. When Lucas ran into him at the voting polls he accused Benton of being delinquent in paying his taxes and thus should not be allowed to vote. Benton accused Lucas of being a \\"puppy\\" and Lucas challenged Benton to a duel. They had a duel on Bloody Island with Lucas being shot through the throat and Benton grazed in the knee. Upon bleeding profusely, Lucas said he was satisfied and Benton released him from completing the duel. However, rumors circulated that Benton, a better shot, had made the rules of 30 feet apart to favor him. Benton challenged Lucas to a rematch on Bloody Island with shots fired from nine feet. Lucas was shot close to the heart and before dying initially told Benton, \\"I do not or cannot forgive you.\\" As death approached Lucas then stated, \\"I can forgive you—I do forgive you.\\" United States Senate career =Early Senate career= Senator Benton between 1844 and 1858 by Mathew Brady The Missouri Compromise of 1820 made the territory into a state, and Benton was elected as one of its first senators. The presidential election of 1824 was a four way struggle between Jackson, John Quincy Adams, William H. Crawford, and Henry Clay. Benton supported Clay. Jackson received a plurality but not a majority of votes, meaning that the election was thrown to the House of Representatives, which would choose among the top 3 candidates. Clay was the fourth vote getter. He was also Speaker of the House, and tried to maneuver the election in favor of Adams. Benton refused Clay's requests that he, despite not being in the House, support Adams, declaring that Jackson was the clear choice of the people. When Missouri's lone representative John Scott wrote to Benton saying he intended to vote for Adams, Benton urged him not to. \\"The vote which you intend thus to give is not your own—it belongs to the people of Missouri. They are against Mr. Adams. I, in their name, do solemnly protest against your intention, and deny your moral power thus to bestow your vote.\\" Benton first supported Crawford, but after determining that he could not win, supported Jackson. Nevertheless, Scott voted for Adams. Adams won the election and appointed Clay Secretary of State. The two were accused of making a \\"corrupt bargain,\\" in which Adams received the presidency in exchange for giving Clay a high office. =Jacksonian democracy= After this, Benton and Jackson put their personal differences behind them and joined forces. Benton became the senatorial leader for the Democratic Party and argued vigorously against the Bank of the United States. Jackson was censured by the Senate in 1834 for canceling the Bank's charter.Meacham, Jon. American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House. New York: Random House, 2009 (279). At the close of the Jackson presidency, Benton led a successful \\"expungement campaign\\" in 1837 to remove the censure motion from the official record.Meacham, Jon. American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House. New York: Random House, 2009 (335–337). Benton was an unflagging advocate for \\"hard money\\", that is gold coin (specie) or bullion as money—as opposed to paper money \\"backed\\" by gold as in a \\"gold standard\\". \\"Soft\\" (i.e. paper or credit) currency, in his opinion, favored rich urban Easterners at the expense of the small farmers and tradespeople of the West. He proposed a law requiring payment for federal land in hard currency only, which was defeated in Congress but later enshrined in an executive order, the Specie Circular, by Jackson (1836). His position on currency earned him the nickname Old Bullion.Violette, 262. Also, alliteratively, \\"Bullion Benton\\"; see Heidler and Heidler, 275. Senator Benton's greatest concern, however, was the territorial expansion of the United States to meet its \\"manifest destiny\\" as a continental power. He originally considered the natural border of the U.S. to be the Rocky Mountains but expanded his view to encompass the Pacific coast. He considered unsettled land to be insecure and tirelessly worked for settlement. His efforts against soft money were mostly to discourage land speculation, and thus encourage settlement. Benton was instrumental in the sole administration of the Oregon Territory. Since the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, Oregon had been jointly occupied by both the United States and the United Kingdom. Benton pushed for a settlement on Oregon and the Canada–US border favorable to the United States. The current border at the 49th parallel set by the Oregon Treaty in 1846 was his choice; he was opposed to the extremism of the \\"Fifty- four forty or fight\\" movement during the Oregon boundary dispute. Daguerreotype of Thomas Hart Benton, ca. 1850 Benton was the author of the first Homestead Acts, which encouraged settlement by giving land grants to anyone willing to work the soil. He pushed for greater exploration of the West, including support for his son-in-law John C. Frémont's numerous treks. He pushed hard for public support of the intercontinental railway and advocated greater use of the telegraph for long-distance communication. He was also a staunch advocate of the disenfranchisement and displacement of Native Americans in favor of European settlers. He was an orator and leader of the first class, able to stand his own with or against fellow senators Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun. Although an expansionist, his personal morals made him opposed to greedy or underhanded behavior—thus his opposition to Fifty-Four Forty. Benton advocated the annexation of Texas and argued for the abrogation of the 1819 Adams-Onís Treaty in which the United States relinquished claims to that territory, but he was opposed to the machinations that led to its annexation in 1845 and the Mexican–American War. He believed that expansion was for the good of the country, and not for the benefit of powerful individuals. On February 28, 1844, Benton was present at the USS Princeton explosion when a cannon misfired on the deck while giving a tour of the Potomac River. The incident killed more than seven people, including United States Secretary of State Abel P. Upshur and United States Secretary of the Navy Thomas W. Gilmer, and wounded over twenty. Benton was one of the injured, but his injury was not serious and he did not miss one day from the Senate. =Later Senate career and tension= His loyalty to the Democratic Party was legendary. Benton was the legislative right-hand-man for Andrew Jackson and continued this role for Martin Van Buren. With the election of James K. Polk, however, his power began to ebb, and his views diverged from the party's. His career took a distinct downturn with the issue of slavery. Benton, a southerner and slave owner, became increasingly uncomfortable with the topic. He was also at odds with fellow Democrats, such as John C. Calhoun, who he thought put their opinions ahead of the Union to a treasonous degree. With troubled conscience, in 1849 he declared himself \\"against the institution of slavery,\\" putting him against his party and popular opinion in his state. In April 1850, during heated Senate floor debates over the proposed Compromise of 1850, Benton was nearly shot by pistol-wielding Mississippi Senator Henry S. Foote, who had taken umbrage to Benton's vitriolic sparring with Vice- President Millard Fillmore. Foote was wrestled to the floor, where he was disarmed. Later life Statue of Benton by Harriet Hosmer erected in 1868 in St. Louis at Lafayette Park In 1851, Benton was denied a sixth term by the Missouri legislature; the polarization of the slavery issue made it impossible for a moderate and Unionist to hold that state's senatorial seat. In 1852 he successfully ran for the United States House of Representatives, but his opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act led to his defeat in 1854. He ran for Governor of Missouri in 1856, but lost to Trusten Polk. That same year, his son-in-law, John C. Frémont, husband of his daughter Jessie, ran for President on the Republican Party ticket; but Benton was a party loyalist to the end and voted for Democratic nomnee James Buchanan, who won the election. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1855.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory He published his autobiography, Thirty Years' View, in 1854, and Historical and legal examination of ... the decision of the Supreme Court ... in the Dred Scott case (arguing that the Court should have declined to decide the case, as political), in 1857. He died in Washington D.C. on April 10, 1858. His descendants have continued to be prominent in Missouri life; his great-grandnephew, also Thomas Hart Benton, was a 20th-century painter. Benton is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. Family connections Benton was related by marriage or blood to a number of 19th-century luminaries. Two of his nephews—Confederate Colonel and posthumous Brigadier General Samuel Benton of Mississippi, and Union Colonel and Brevet Brigadier General Thomas H. Benton, Jr. of Iowa—fought on opposite sides during the Civil War. He was brother-in-law of Senator/Governor James McDowell of Virginia; father-in-law of explorer, Union Major General, and presidential candidate John C. Frémont; and cousin-in-law of Senators Henry Clay, the Benton family children of former King Joseph BonaparteHeidler, David S. and Jeanne T. Heidler. Henry Clay: The Essential American. New York: Random House, 2010 (146). and James Brown, all of whom married cousins of Benton. His great-nephew was Congressman Maecenas Eason Benton, the father of painter Thomas Hart Benton. Legacy Benton depicted on an 1882 $100 Gold certificate Seven states (Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, and Washington) have counties named after Benton. Two counties (Calhoun County, Alabama and Hernando County, Florida) were formerly named Benton County in his honor. During Reconstruction, Benton County, Mississippi, was misrepresented by residents as being named after Benton. Bentonville, Indiana, was named for the senator, as were the towns of Bentonville, Arkansas, Benton Harbor, Michigan, and Benton, Illinois. Additionally, the fur trading post and now community of Fort Benton, Montana, for which bentonite is named, was named after Benton. In July 2018, the president of Oregon State University, Ed Ray, announced that three campus buildings would be renamed due to their namesakes' racism. One of these buildings, formerly known as the Benton Annex after Benton, became the Hattie Redmond Women and Gender Center. The choice to rename it after Redmond was made to recognize her efforts as an Oregonian suffragist. Uniquely, Benton has been the subject of biographical study by two men who later became presidents of the United States. In 1887, Theodore Roosevelt published a biography of Benton.Morris, Edmund. The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, Revised and Updated. New York: The Modern Library, 2001. (328). Morris attributes Roosevelt's belief in manifest destiny to Benton (see Morris, 392). Benton is also one of the eight senators profiled in John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage.John F. Kennedy. Profiles in Courage. Harper and Brothers, 1956.

This results in pain at the outside of the wrist. Pain is typically increased with gripping or rotating the wrist. The thumb may also be difficult to move smoothly. Onset of symptoms is gradual. Risk factors include certain repetitive movements, trauma, and rheumatic diseases. The diagnosis is generally based on symptoms and physical examination. Diagnosis is supported if pain increases when the wrist is bent inwards while a person is grabbing their thumb within a fist. Treatment involves avoiding activities that bring on the symptoms, pain medications such as NSAIDs, and splinting the thumb. If this is not effective steroid injections or surgery may be recommended. The condition affects about 0.5% of males and 1.3% of females. Those who are middle aged are most often affected. It was first described in 1895 by Fritz de Quervain. Signs and symptoms Symptoms are pain at the radial side of the wrist, spasms, tenderness, occasional burning sensation in the hand, and swelling over the thumb side of the wrist, and difficulty gripping with the affected side of the hand. The onset is often gradual. Pain is made worse by movement of the thumb and wrist, and may radiate to the thumb or the forearm. Causes Young people using their smartphones with their thumbs. The cause of de Quervain's disease is not established. Evidence regarding a possible relation with occupational risk factors is debated. A systematic review of potential risk factors discussed in the literature did not find any evidence of a causal relationship with occupational factors. However, researchers in France found personal and work- related factors were associated with de Quervain's disease in the working population; wrist bending and movements associated with the twisting or driving of screws were the most significant of the work-related factors. Proponents of the view that De Quervain syndrome is a repetitive strain injury consider postures where the thumb is held in abduction and extension to be predisposing factors. Workers who perform rapid repetitive activities involving pinching, grasping, pulling or pushing have been considered at increased risk. These movements are associated with many types of repetitive housework such as chopping vegetables, stirring and scrubbing pots, vacuuming, cleaning surfaces, drying dishes, pegging out washing, mending clothes, gardening, harvesting and weeding. Specific activities that have been postulated as potential risk factors include intensive computer mouse use, trackball use, and typing, as well as some pastimes, including bowling, golf, fly-fishing, piano-playing, sewing, and knitting. Women are affected more often than men. The syndrome commonly occurs during and after pregnancy. Contributory factors may include increased housework, hormonal changes, fluid retention and—more debatably—lifting. Pathophysiology The mucous sheaths of the tendons on the back of the wrist. De Quervain syndrome involves noninflammatory thickening of the tendons and the synovial sheaths that the tendons run through. The two tendons concerned are those of the extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus muscles. These two muscles run side by side and function to bring the thumb away from the hand; the extensor pollicis brevis brings the thumb outwards radially, and the abductor pollicis longus brings the thumb forward away from the palm. De Quervain tendinopathy affects the tendons of these muscles as they pass from the forearm into the hand via a fibro-osseous tunnel (the first dorsal compartment). Evaluation of histopathological specimens shows a thickening and myxoid degeneration consistent with a chronic degenerative process, as opposed to inflammation. The pathology is identical in de Quervain seen in new mothers. Diagnosis De Quervain syndrome is diagnosed clinically, based on history and physical examination, though diagnostic imaging such as X-ray may be used to rule out fracture, arthritis, or other causes, based on the person's history and presentation. The modified Eichoff maneuver, commonly called the Finkelstein's test, is a physical exam maneuver used to diagnose de Quervain syndrome. To perform the test, the examiner grasps and ulnar deviates the hand when the person has their thumb held within their fist. If sharp pain occurs along the distal radius (top of forearm, about an inch below the wrist), de Quervain's syndrome is likely. While a positive Finkelstein's test is often considered pathognomonic for de Quervain syndrome, the maneuver can also cause pain in those with osteoarthritis at the base of the thumb. =Differential diagnosis= Differential diagnoses include: # Osteoarthritis of the first carpo-metacarpal joint # Intersection syndrome—pain will be more towards the middle of the back of the forearm and about 2–3 inches below the wrist # Wartenberg's syndrome Treatment As with many musculoskeletal conditions, the management of de Quervain's disease is determined more by convention than scientific data. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2013 found that corticosteroid injection seems to be an effective form of conservative management of de Quervain's syndrome in approximately 50% of patients, although more research is needed regarding the extent of any clinical benefits. Efficacy data are relatively sparse and it is not clear whether benefits affect the overall natural history of the illness. Most tendinoses are self-limiting and the same is likely to be true of de Quervain's although further study is needed. Palliative treatments include a splint that immobilized the wrist and the thumb to the interphalangeal joint and anti- inflammatory medication or acetaminophen. Systematic review and meta-analysis do not support the use of splinting over steroid injections. Surgery (in which the sheath of the first dorsal compartment is opened longitudinally) is documented to provide relief in most patients. The most important risk is to the radial sensory nerve. Some occupational and physical therapists suggest alternative lifting mechanics based on the theory that the condition is due to repetitive use of the thumbs during lifting. Physical/Occupational therapy can suggest activities to avoid based on the theory that certain activities might exacerbate one's condition, as well as instruct on strengthening exercises based on the theory that this will contribute to better form and use of other muscle groups, which might limit irritation of the tendons. Some occupational and physical therapists use other treatments, in conjunction with Therapeutic Exercises, based on the rationale that they reduce inflammation and pain and promote healing: UST, SWD, or other deep heat treatments, as well as TENS, acupuncture, or infrared light therapy, and cold laser treatments. However, the pathology of the condition is not inflammatory changes to the synovial sheath and inflammation is secondary to the condition from friction. Teaching patients to reduce their secondary inflammation does not treat the underlying condition but may reduce their pain; which is helpful when trying to perform the prescribed exercise interventions. Getting Physical Therapy before surgery or injections has been shown to reduce overall costs to patients and is a viable option to treat a wide array of musculoskeletal injuries. History From the original description of the illness in 1895 until the first description of corticosteroid injection by Jarrod Ismond in 1955, it appears that the only treatment offered was surgery. Since approximately 1972, the prevailing opinion has been that of McKenzie (1972) who suggested that corticosteroid injection was the first line of treatment and surgery should be reserved for unsuccessful injections. =Eponym= It is named after the Swiss surgeon Fritz de Quervain who first identified it in 1895. It should not be confused with de Quervain's thyroiditis, another condition named after the same person. Society and culture BlackBerry thumb is a neologism that refers to a form of repetitive strain injury (RSI) caused by the frequent use of the thumbs to press buttons on PDAs, smartphones, or other mobile devices. The name of the condition comes from the BlackBerry, a brand of smartphone that debuted in 1999, although there are numerous other similar eponymous conditions that exist such as \\"Wiiitis\\", \\"Nintendinitis\\", \\"Playstation thumb\\", \\"texting thumb\\", \\"cellphone thumb\\", \\"smartphone thumb\\", \\"Android thumb\\", and \\"iPhone thumb\\". The medical name for the condition is De Quervain syndrome and is associated with the tendons connected to the thumb through the wrist. Causes for the condition extend beyond smartphones and gaming consoles to include activities like golf, racket sports, and lifting. Symptoms of BlackBerry thumb include aching and throbbing pain in the thumb and wrist. In severe cases, it can lead to temporary disability of the affected hand, particularly the ability to grip objects. One hypothesis is that the thumb does not have the dexterity the other four fingers have and is therefore not well-suited to high speed touch typing.

Non-radiative 'near-field' behaviors dominate close to the antenna or scattering object, while electromagnetic radiation 'far-field' behaviors dominate at greater distances. Far-field E (electric) and B (magnetic) field strength decreases as the distance from the source increases, resulting in an inverse-square law for the radiated power intensity of electromagnetic radiation. By contrast, near-field E and B strength decrease more rapidly with distance: the radiative field decreases by the inverse- distance squared, the reactive field by an inverse cubed law, resulting in a diminished power in the parts of the electric field by an inverse fourth-power and sixth-power, respectively. The rapid drop in power contained in the near- field ensures that effects due to the near-field essentially vanish a few wavelengths away from the radiating part of the antenna. Summary of regions and their interactions Near field: This dipole pattern shows a magnetic field \\\\overrightarrow{\\\\mathbf{B}} in red. The potential energy momentarily stored in this magnetic field is indicative of the reactive near field. Far field: The radiation pattern can extend into the far field, where the reactive stored energy has no significant presence. The far field is the region in which the field acts as \\"normal\\" electromagnetic radiation. In this region, it is dominated by electric or magnetic fields with electric dipole characteristics. The near field is governed by multipole type fields, which can be considered as collections of dipoles with a fixed phase relationship. The boundary between the two regions is only vaguely defined, and it depends on the dominant wavelength () emitted by the source and the size of the radiating element. In the far-field region of an antenna, radiated power decreases as the square of distance, and absorption of the radiation does not feed back to the transmitter. However, in the near-field region, absorption of radiation does affect the load on the transmitter. Magnetic induction as seen in a transformer can be seen as a very simple example of this type of near- field electromagnetic interaction. In the far-field region, each part of the EM field (electric and magnetic) is \\"produced by\\" (or associated with) a change in the other part, and the ratio of electric and magnetic field intensities is simply the wave impedance. However, in the near-field region, the electric and magnetic fields can exist independently of each other, and one type of field can dominate the other. In a normally-operating antenna, positive and negative charges have no way of leaving and are separated from each other by the excitation \\"signal\\" (a transmitter or other EM exciting potential). This generates an oscillating (or reversing) electrical dipole, which affects both the near field and the far field. In general, the purpose of antennas is to communicate wirelessly for long distances using far fields, and this is their main region of operation (however, certain antennas specialized for near-field communication do exist). Also known as the radiation-zone field, the far field carries a relatively uniform wave pattern. The radiation zone is important because far fields in general fall off in amplitude by . This means that the total energy per unit area at a distance is proportional to . The area of the sphere is proportional to , so the total energy passing through the sphere is constant. This means that the far-field energy actually escapes to infinite distance (it radiates). In contrast, the near field refers to regions such as near conductors and inside polarizable media where the propagation of electromagnetic waves is interfered with. One easy-to-observe example is the change of noise levels picked up by a set of rabbit ear antennas when one places a body part in close range. The near-field has been of increasing interest, particularly in the development of capacitive sensing technologies such as those used in the touchscreens of smart phones and tablet computers. The interaction with the medium (e.g. body capacitance) can cause energy to deflect back to the source, as occurs in the reactive near field. Or the interaction with the medium can fail to return energy back to the source, but cause a distortion in the electromagnetic wave that deviates significantly from that found in free space, and this indicates the radiative near-field region, which is somewhat further away. Another intermediate region, called the transition zone, is defined on a somewhat different basis, namely antenna geometry and excitation wavelength. Definitions The separation of the electric and magnetic fields into components is mathematical, rather than clearly physical, and is based on the relative rates at which the amplitude of parts of the electric and magnetic fields diminish as distance from the radiating element increases. The amplitudes of the far- field components fall off as 1/r, the radiative near-field amplitudes fall off as 1/r^2, and the reactive near-field amplitudes fall off as 1/r^3.Amplitude fall-off is not to be confused with the power fall-off; power falls off as the amplitude squared. Definitions of the regions attempt to characterize locations where the activity of the associated field components are the strongest. Mathematically, the distinction between field components is very clear, but the demarcation of the spatial field regions is subjective. All of the fields overlap everywhere, so for example, there are always substantial far-field and near-field radiative components in the closest-in near-field reactive region. The regions defined below categorize field behaviors that are variable, even within the region of interest. Thus, the boundaries for these regions are approximate rules of thumb, as there are no precise cutoffs between them: All behavioral changes with distance are smooth changes. Even when precise boundaries can be defined in some cases, based primarily on antenna type and antenna size, experts may differ in their use of nomenclature to describe the regions. Because of these nuances, special care must be taken when interpreting technical literature that discusses “far-field” and “near- field” regions. The term “near-field region” (also known as the “near field” or “near zone”) has the following meanings with respect to different telecommunications technologies: * The close-in region of an antenna where the angular field distribution is dependent upon the distance from the antenna. * In the study of diffraction and antenna design, the near field is that part of the radiated field that is below distances shorter than the Fraunhofer distance, which is given by d_\\\\text{F} = \\\\frac{2 D^2}{\\\\lambda} from the source of the diffracting edge or antenna of longitude or diameter . * In optical fiber communications, the region near a source or aperture that is closer than the Rayleigh length. (Presuming a Gaussian beam, which is appropriate for fiber optics.) =Regions according to electromagnetic length= The most convenient practice is to define the size of the regions or zones in terms of fixed numbers (fractions) of wavelengths distant from the center of the radiating part of the antenna, with the clear understanding that the values chosen are only approximate and will be somewhat inappropriate for different antennas in different surroundings. The choice of the cut-off numbers is based on the relative strengths of the field component amplitudes typically seen in ordinary practice. Electromagnetically short antennas Field regions for antennas equal to, or shorter than, one-half wavelength of the radiation they emit, such as the whip antenna of a citizen's band radio, or an AM radio broadcast tower. For antennas shorter than half of the wavelength of the radiation they emit (i.e., electromagnetically “short” antennas), the far and near regional boundaries are measured in terms of a simple ratio of the distance from the radiating source to the wavelength of the radiation. For such an antenna, the near field is the region within a radius , while the far- field is the region for which . The transition zone is the region between and . Note that , the length of the antenna is not important, and the approximation is the same for all shorter antennas (sometimes idealized as so- called “point antennas”). In all such antennas, the short length means that charges and currents in each sub-section of the antenna are the same at any given time, since the antenna is too short for the RF transmitter voltage to reverse before its effects on charges and currents are felt over the entire antenna length. Electromagnetically long antennas For antennas physically larger than a half-wavelength of the radiation they emit, the near and far fields are defined in terms of the Fraunhofer distance. Named after Joseph von Fraunhofer, the following formula gives the Fraunhofer distance: :d_\\\\text{F} \\\\; = \\\\; \\\\frac{2 D^2}{\\\\lambda} \\\\, , where is the largest dimension of the radiator (or the diameter of the antenna) and is the wavelength of the radio wave. Either of the following two relations are equivalent, emphasizing the size of the region in terms of wavelengths or diameters : :d_\\\\text{F} \\\\; = \\\\; 2 \\\\,{ \\\\left( { D \\\\over \\\\lambda } \\\\right) }^2 \\\\; \\\\lambda \\\\; = \\\\; 2 \\\\,{ \\\\left( { D \\\\over \\\\lambda } \\\\right) } \\\\, D \\\\, , This distance provides the limit between the near and far field. The parameter corresponds to the physical length of an antenna, or the diameter of a \\"dish\\" antenna. Having an antenna electromagnetically longer than one-half the dominated wavelength emitted considerably extends the near-field effects, especially that of focused antennas. Conversely, when a given antenna emits high frequency radiation, it will have a near-field region larger than what would be implied by the shorter wavelength. Additionally, a far-field region distance must satisfy these two conditions. :d_\\\\text{F} \\\\gg D\\\\, :d_\\\\text{F} \\\\gg \\\\lambda\\\\, where is the largest physical linear dimension of the antenna and is the far- field distance. The far-field distance is the distance from the transmitting antenna to the beginning of the Fraunhofer region, or far field.  Transition zone  The \\"transition zone\\" between these near and far field regions, extending over the distance from one to two wavelengths from the antenna, is the intermediate region in which both near-field and far-field effects are important. In this region, near-field behavior dies out and ceases to be important, leaving far-field effects as dominant interactions. (See the \\"Far Field\\" image above.) =Regions according to diffraction behavior= Near- and far-field regions for an antenna larger (diameter or length ) than the wavelength of the radiation it emits, so that Examples are radar dishes, satellite dish antennas, radio telescopes, and other highly directional antennas. Far-field diffraction As far as acoustic wave sources are concerned, if the source has a maximum overall dimension or aperture width () that is large compared to the wavelength , the far-field region is commonly taken to exist at distances, when the Fresnel parameter S is larger than 1: :S = {{4\\\\lambda}\\\\over D^2}r > 1,\\\\;\\\\text{for}\\\\; r > r_\\\\text{F}={D^2\\\\over {4\\\\lambda}}. For a beam focused at infinity, the far-field region is sometimes referred to as the \\"Fraunhofer region\\". Other synonyms are \\"far field\\", \\"far zone\\", and \\"radiation field\\". Any electromagnetic radiation consists of an electric field component and a magnetic field component . In the far field, the relationship between the electric field component and the magnetic component is that characteristic of any freely propagating wave, where and have equal magnitudes at any point in space (where measured in units where speed of light). Near-field diffraction In contrast to the far field, the diffraction pattern in the near field typically differs significantly from that observed at infinity and varies with distance from the source. In the near field, the relationship between and becomes very complex. Also, unlike the far field where electromagnetic waves are usually characterized by a single polarization type (horizontal, vertical, circular, or elliptical), all four polarization types can be present in the near field. The \\"near field\\" is a region in which there are strong inductive and capacitive effects from the currents and charges in the antenna that cause electromagnetic components that do not behave like far-field radiation. These effects decrease in power far more quickly with distance than do the far-field radiation effects. Non-propagating (or evanescent) fields extinguish very rapidly with distance, which makes their effects almost exclusively felt in the near-field region. Also, in the part of the near field closest to the antenna (called the \\"reactive near field\\", see below), absorption of electromagnetic power in the region by a second device has effects that feed back to the transmitter, increasing the load on the transmitter that feeds the antenna by decreasing the antenna impedance that the transmitter \\"sees\\". Thus, the transmitter can sense when power is being absorbed in the closest near- field zone (by a second antenna or some other object) and is forced to supply extra power to its antenna, and to draw extra power from its own power supply, whereas if no power is being absorbed there, the transmitter does not have to supply extra power.  Near-field characteristics  Differences between Fraunhofer diffraction and Fresnel diffraction. The near field itself is further divided into the reactive near field and the radiative near field. The \\"reactive\\" and \\"radiative\\" near-field designations are also a function of wavelength (or distance). However, these boundary regions are a fraction of one wavelength within the near field. The outer boundary of the reactive near- field region is commonly considered to be a distance of \\\\tfrac{1}{2\\\\pi} times the wavelength, i.e., \\\\tfrac{\\\\lambda}{2\\\\pi} or ) from the antenna surface. The reactive near-field is also called the \\"inductive\\" near-field. The radiative near field (also called the \\"Fresnel region\\") covers the remainder of the near-field region, from \\\\tfrac{\\\\lambda}{2\\\\pi} out to the Fraunhofer distance. = Reactive near field, or the nearest part of the near field = In the reactive near field (very close to the antenna), the relationship between the strengths of the and fields is often too complicated to easily predict, and difficult to measure. Either field component ( or ) may dominate at one point, and the opposite relationship dominate at a point only a short distance away. This makes finding the true power density in this region problematic. This is because to calculate power, not only and both have to be measured but the phase relationship between and as well as the angle between the two vectors must also be known in every point of space. In this reactive region, not only is an electromagnetic wave being radiated outward into far space but there is a \\"reactive\\" component to the electromagnetic field, meaning that the nature of the field around the antenna is sensitive to EM absorption in this region, and reacts to it. In contrast, this is not true for absorption far from the antenna, which has no effect on the transmitter or antenna near field. Very close to the antenna, in the reactive region, energy of a certain amount, if not absorbed by a receiver, is held back and is stored very near the antenna surface. This energy is carried back and forth from the antenna to the reactive near field by electromagnetic radiation of the type that slowly changes electrostatic and magnetostatic effects. For example, current flowing in the antenna creates a purely magnetic component in the near field, which then collapses as the antenna current begins to reverse, causing transfer of the field's magnetic energy back to electrons in the antenna as the changing magnetic field causes a self-inductive effect on the antenna that generated it. This returns energy to the antenna in a regenerative way, so that it is not lost. A similar process happens as electric charge builds up in one section of the antenna under the pressure of the signal voltage, and causes a local electric field around that section of antenna, due to the antenna's self-capacitance. When the signal reverses so that charge is allowed to flow away from this region again, the built-up electric field assists in pushing electrons back in the new direction of their flow, as with the discharge of any unipolar capacitor. This again transfers energy back to the antenna current. Because of this energy storage and return effect, if either of the inductive or electrostatic effects in the reactive near field transfer any field energy to electrons in a different (nearby) conductor, then this energy is lost to the primary antenna. When this happens, an extra drain is seen on the transmitter, resulting from the reactive near-field energy that is not returned. This effect shows up as a different impedance in the antenna, as seen by the transmitter. The reactive component of the near field can give ambiguous or undetermined results when attempting measurements in this region. In other regions, the power density is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the antenna. In the vicinity very close to the antenna, however, the energy level can rise dramatically with only a small decrease in distance toward the antenna. This energy can adversely affect both humans and measurement equipment because of the high powers involved. = Radiative near field (Fresnel region), or farthest part of the near field = The radiative near field (sometimes called the Fresnel region) does not contain reactive field components from the source antenna, since it is far enough from the antenna that back-coupling of the fields becomes out of phase with the antenna signal, and thus cannot efficiently return inductive or capacitive energy from antenna currents or charges. The energy in the radiative near field is thus all radiant energy, although its mixture of magnetic and electric components are still different from the far field. Further out into the radiative near field (one half wavelength to 1 wavelength from the source), the and field relationship is more predictable, but the to relationship is still complex. However, since the radiative near field is still part of the near field, there is potential for unanticipated (or adverse) conditions. For example, metal objects such as steel beams can act as antennas by inductively receiving and then \\"re-radiating\\" some of the energy in the radiative near field, forming a new radiating surface to consider. Depending on antenna characteristics and frequencies, such coupling may be far more efficient than simple antenna reception in the yet-more-distant far field, so far more power may be transferred to the secondary \\"antenna\\" in this region than would be the case with a more distant antenna. When a secondary radiating antenna surface is thus activated, it then creates its own near-field regions, but the same conditions apply to them. = Compared to the far field = The near field is remarkable for reproducing classical electromagnetic induction and electric charge effects on the EM field, which effects \\"die-out\\" with increasing distance from the antenna: The magnetic field component that’s in phase quadrature to electric fields is proportional to the inverse-cube of the distance () and electric field strength proportional to inverse-square of distance (). This fall-off is far more rapid than the classical radiated far- field ( and fields, which are proportional to the simple inverse-distance (). Typically near-field effects are not important farther away than a few wavelengths of the antenna. More-distant near-field effects also involve energy transfer effects that couple directly to receivers near the antenna, affecting the power output of the transmitter if they do couple, but not otherwise. In a sense, the near field offers energy that is available to a receiver only if the energy is tapped, and this is sensed by the transmitter by means of responding to electromagnetic near fields emanating from the receiver. Again, this is the same principle that applies in induction coupled devices, such as a transformer, which draws more power at the primary circuit, if power is drawn from the secondary circuit. This is different with the far field, which constantly draws the same energy from the transmitter, whether it is immediately received, or not. The amplitude of other components (non- radiative/non-dipole) of the electromagnetic field close to the antenna may be quite powerful, but, because of more rapid fall-off with distance than behavior, they do not radiate energy to infinite distances. Instead, their energies remain trapped in the region near the antenna, not drawing power from the transmitter unless they excite a receiver in the area close to the antenna. Thus, the near fields only transfer energy to very nearby receivers, and, when they do, the result is felt as an extra power draw in the transmitter. As an example of such an effect, power is transferred across space in a common transformer or metal detector by means of near-field phenomena (in this case inductive coupling), in a strictly \\"short-range\\" effect (i.e., the range within one wavelength of the signal).  Classical EM modelling  A \\"radiation pattern\\" for an antenna, by definition showing only the far field. Solving Maxwell's equations for the electric and magnetic fields for a localized oscillating source, such as an antenna, surrounded by a homogeneous material (typically vacuum or air), yields fields that, far away, decay in proportion to where is the distance from the source. These are the radiating fields, and the region where is large enough for these fields to dominate is the far field. In general, the fields of a source in a homogeneous isotropic medium can be written as a multipole expansion.John David Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd edition (Wiley: New York, 1998) The terms in this expansion are spherical harmonics (which give the angular dependence) multiplied by spherical Bessel functions (which give the radial dependence). For large , the spherical Bessel functions decay as , giving the radiated field above. As one gets closer and closer to the source (smaller ), approaching the near field, other powers of become significant. The next term that becomes significant is proportional to and is sometimes called the induction term. It can be thought of as the primarily magnetic energy stored in the field, and returned to the antenna in every half-cycle, through self- induction. For even smaller , terms proportional to become significant; this is sometimes called the electrostatic field term and can be thought of as stemming from the electrical charge in the antenna element. Very close to the source, the multipole expansion is less useful (too many terms are required for an accurate description of the fields). Rather, in the near field, it is sometimes useful to express the contributions as a sum of radiating fields combined with evanescent fields, where the latter are exponentially decaying with . And in the source itself, or as soon as one enters a region of inhomogeneous materials, the multipole expansion is no longer valid and the full solution of Maxwell's equations is generally required. = Antennas = If an oscillating electrical current is applied to a conductive structure of some type, electric and magnetic fields will appear in space about that structure. If those fields are lost to a propagating space wave the structure is often termed an antenna. Such an antenna can be an assemblage of conductors in space typical of radio devices or it can be an aperture with a given current distribution radiating into space as is typical of microwave or optical devices. The actual values of the fields in space about the antenna are usually quite complex and can vary with distance from the antenna in various ways. However, in many practical applications, one is interested only in effects where the distance from the antenna to the observer is very much greater than the largest dimension of the transmitting antenna. The equations describing the fields created about the antenna can be simplified by assuming a large separation and dropping all terms that provide only minor contributions to the final field. These simplified distributions have been termed the \\"far field\\" and usually have the property that the angular distribution of energy does not change with distance, although the energy levels still vary with distance and time. Such an angular energy distribution is usually termed an antenna pattern. Note that, by the principle of reciprocity, the pattern observed when a particular antenna is transmitting is identical to the pattern measured when the same antenna is used for reception. Typically one finds simple relations describing the antenna far-field patterns, often involving trigonometric functions or at worst Fourier or Hankel transform relationships between the antenna current distributions and the observed far-field patterns. While far-field simplifications are very useful in engineering calculations, this does not mean the near-field functions cannot be calculated, especially using modern computer techniques. An examination of how the near fields form about an antenna structure can give great insight into the operations of such devices. =Impedance= The electromagnetic field in the far-field region of an antenna is independent of the details of the near field and the nature of the antenna. The wave impedance is the ratio of the strength of the electric and magnetic fields, which in the far field are in phase with each other. Thus, the far field \\"impedance of free space\\" is resistive and is given by: :Z_0 \\\\ \\\\overset{\\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{def}}{}}{=}\\\\ \\\\mu_0 c_0 = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{\\\\varepsilon_0}} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\varepsilon_0 c_0} . With the usual approximation for the speed of light in free space , this gives the frequently used expression: :Z_0 = 119.92\\\\, \\\\pi\\\\ \\\\text{Ω} \\\\approx 120\\\\,\\\\pi\\\\ \\\\text{Ω} \\\\approx 377\\\\ \\\\text{Ω} The electromagnetic field in the near-field region of an electrically small coil antenna is predominantly magnetic. For small values of the impedance of a magnetic loop is low and inductive, at short range being asymptotic to: :Z_W \\\\approx 240\\\\pi^2 \\\\frac r{\\\\lambda} \\\\approx 2370 \\\\frac r{\\\\lambda} . The electromagnetic field in the near-field region of an electrically short rod antenna is predominantly electric. For small values of the impedance is high and capacitive, at short range being asymptotic to: :Z_W \\\\approx 60 \\\\frac {\\\\lambda}r . In both cases, the wave impedance converges on that of free space as the range approaches the far field.

He is venerated as a saint in the Oriental Orthodox Church and his feast day is 31 July.Livingstone (2006) Jacob's missionary efforts helped establish the non-Chalcedonian Syriac Orthodox Church, also known as the \\"Jacobite\\" Church after its eponymous founder, and ensured its survival despite persecution. Background Following the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the church in the Eastern Roman Empire suffered division between Chalcedonians, supporters of the council, and non-Chalcedonians, also known as miaphysites, who opposed the council. Non-Chalcedonians lost political support at the ascension of Emperor Justin I in 518,Saint-Laurent (2015), p. 3 who subsequently persecuted non-Chalcedonians.Saint-Laurent (2015), p. 68 Consequentially, the number of non-Chalcedonian religious leaders declined and, despite the widespread support they held in Syria, Armenia, and Egypt, non-Chalcedonianism faced extinction.Saint-Laurent (2015), p. 96 Biography Jacob was born in c. 500 in the city of Tall Mawzalt,Anderson (1999), p. 43 and was the son of Theophilus bar Manu, a priest. At the age of two, Jacob was left in the care of Eustathius, Abbot of the Monastery of Fsilta,Venables (1911) and studied Greek, Syriac, and religious and theological texts.Barsoum (2003), p. 100 Jacob's mother later returned to the monastery and attempted to bring him home, however, Jacob refused to return and declared his dedication to Christ.St. Jacob Baradaeus. Northeast American Diocese of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church After his parents' death, Jacob donated his inheritance to the poor and manumitted several slaves he had inherited, to whom he bestowed his parents' house. Later, Jacob was ordained a deacon and priest at the monastery. At this time, Jacob became renowned as a miracle-worker and people came to him seeking healing. Several miracles are attributed to Jacob, such as the resurrection of the dead, the healing of the blind, procurement of rain, and stopping the movement of the sun. He is also reputed to have ended the Siege of Edessa as Khosrow I was afflicted with a vision and abandoned the siege. Empress Theodora, a non-Chalcedonian, learned of Jacob and invited him to meet with her at Constantinople, however, he was reluctant to do so. In a vision, Jacob was instructed to travel to Constantinople, and thus, in c. 527, he arrived at the capital.Irvin & Sunquist (2001), pp. 248–249 Theodora received Jacob with honour, however, he was uninterested in life at court, and entered the Monastery of Sykai, where he remained for 15 years. Whilst at Constantinople, he gained the favour of Theodora and Al-Harith ibn Jabalah, King of the Ghassanids, both fellow non-Chalcedonians.Gregory (1991) An outbreak of persecution of non-Chalcedonians carried out by Ephraim, Patriarch of Antioch, spurred Empress Theodora and Al-Harith to urge Pope Theodosius I of Alexandria to consecrate bishops to counter Ephraim and ensure the survival of non- Chalcedonianism. Thus, Jacob was consecrated Bishop of Edessa by Pope Theodosius in Constantinople in 543/544. After his episcopal appointment, Jacob travelled to Alexandria, where he, with two non-Chalcedonian bishops, consecrated Conon as Bishop of Tarsus and Eugenius as Bishop of Seleucia. He then set about consecrating non-Chalcedonian clergymen throughout Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt.Treadgold (1997), p. 198 At this time, through his missionary work, Jacob aimed to restore non-Chalcedonianism as the official position of the church in the Eastern Roman Empire. The Roman government attempted to hinder the non-Chalcedonian revival and imprison Jacob, however, in his travels he wore a disguise and thus became known as Burde'ana, \\"man in ragged clothes\\", from which the sobriquet \\"Baradaeus\\" is derived. Jacob ordained Sergius bar Karya as Bishop of Harran and Sergius of Tella as Patriarch of Antioch in 544. After Sergius of Tella's death in 547, with Eugenius, Jacob ordained Paul as Patriarch of Antioch in 550. Differences between Jacob and Eugenius and Conon later emerged and Jacob anathematised the pair for their adherence to Tritheism, and they anathematised Jacob on the accusation of adherence to Sabellianism. In 553, Emperor Justinian I convened the Second Council of Constantinople in an attempt to unite Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians. However, the council was unconvincing to Syrian non- Chalcedonians, and Jacob began to form a separate, non-Chalcedonian church, that would later become the Syriac Orthodox Church.Gregory (2010), p. 318 Jacob ordained John of Ephesus as Bishop of Ephesus in 558.Saint-Laurent (2015), p. 74 In 559, Jacob consecrated Ahudemmeh as Metropolitan of the East.Barsoum (2003), p. 99 In 566, Jacob attended discussions held by Emperor Justin II at Constantinople between Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians with the goal of a compromise between the two factions.Treadgold (1997), pp. 219–220 At the end of the discussions in 567, Justin issued an edict which was agreed upon by all who attended, however, the edict was rejected by a non- Chalcedonian council at Raqqa. Later, in 571, Jacob Baradaeus and other non- Chalcedonian bishops gave their approval to an edict of union with the Chalcedonian church as they both agreed they held the same beliefs but expressed them differently.Treadgold (1997), p. 221 Jacob and the other bishops subsequently accepted communion from John Scholasticus, Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. This angered many non-Chalcedonians, however, and the bishops withdrew their approval of the edict. Unbeknownst to Jacob, Paul, Patriarch of Antioch, and several other non-Chalcedonian bishops, had been tortured by the Roman government and unwillingly agreed to adhere to Chalcedonianism. Jacob consequentially forbade Paul from receiving communion and Paul took refuge in the Kingdom of the Ghassanids. Three years later, Paul was brought before a non-Chalcedonian synod and Jacob restored him to communion for his penance. This angered Egyptian non-Chalcedonians, and, in 576, Pope Peter IV of Alexandria deposed Paul as Patriarch of Antioch, contrary to canon law. Jacob denounced Peter, however, in an effort to reunite non-Chalcedonians, he travelled to Alexandria and agreed to give his assent to Paul's deposition on the condition he was not excommunicated, thus restoring good relations between the Syrian and Egyptian non-Chalcedonians. Nevertheless, on Jacob's return to Syria, many Syrian non-Chalcedonians expressed anger at the compromise and violence erupted between Jacob and Paul's supporters. King Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Harith, Al-Harith's successor, and Paul attempted to discuss the conflict with Jacob, however, he refused to seek another compromise. Jacob, with several other bishops, abruptly left Syria with the intention of travelling to Alexandria. Whilst en route, Jacob and his group stopped at the Monastery of St. Romanus in Maiuma where they became ill and Jacob died on 30 July 578. According to Cyriacus, Bishop of Mardin, Jacob's remains were kept at the Monastery of St. Romanus until moved to the Monastery of Fsilta in 622.Barsoum (2003), p. 212 References Bibliography    * Category:6th-century Oriental Orthodox archbishops Category:6th-century Christian saints Category:6th-century Byzantine people Category:Bishops of Edessa Category:Syrian archbishops Category:Syriac Orthodox Church bishops Category:Syrian Oriental Orthodox Christians Category:Oriental Orthodox saints Category:500s births Category:578 deaths Category:Wonderworkers Category:Ancient Christians involved in controversies ","title":"Jacob Baradaeus"},{"id":"271723","text":"An off-by-one error or off-by-one bug (known by acronyms OBOE, OBO, OB1 and OBOB) is a logic error involving the discrete equivalent of a boundary condition. It often occurs in computer programming when an iterative loop iterates one time too many or too few. This problem could arise when a programmer makes mistakes such as using \\"is less than or equal to\\" where \\"is less than\\" should have been used in a comparison, or fails to take into account that a sequence starts at zero rather than one (as with array indices in many languages). This can also occur in a mathematical context. Looping over arrays Consider an array of items, and items m through n (inclusive) are to be processed. How many items are there? An intuitive answer may be n − m, but that is off by one, exhibiting a fencepost error; the correct answer is (n – m) + 1\\\\. For this reason, ranges in computing are often represented by half-open intervals; the range from m to n (inclusive) is represented by the range from m (inclusive) to n + 1 (exclusive) to avoid fencepost errors. For example, a loop that iterates five times (from 0 to 4 inclusive) can be written as a half-open interval from 0 to 5: for (index = 0; index < 5; index++) { /* Body of the loop */ } The loop body is executed first of all with \`index\` equal to 0; \`index\` then becomes 1, 2, 3, and finally 4 on successive iterations. At that point, \`index\` becomes 5, so \`index < 5\` is false and the loop ends. However, if the comparison used were \`<=\` (less than or equal to), the loop would be carried out six times: \`index\` takes the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Likewise, if \`index\` were initialized to 1 rather than 0, there would only be four iterations: \`index\` takes the values 1, 2, 3, and 4. Both of these alternatives can cause off-by-one errors. Another such error can occur if a do-while loop is used in place of a while loop (or vice versa.) A do-while loop is guaranteed to run at least once. Array-related confusion may also result from differences in programming languages. Numbering from 0 is most common, but some languages start array numbering with 1. Pascal has arrays with user-defined indices. This makes it possible to model the array indices after the problem domain. Fencepost error A straight fence with n sections has n+1 posts. A fencepost error (occasionally called a telegraph pole, lamp-post, or picket fence error) is a specific type of off- by-one error. An early description of this error appears in the works of Vitruvius.. The following problem illustrates the error: The naive answer 10 is wrong. The fence has 10 sections, but 11 posts. The reverse error occurs when the number of posts is known and the number of sections is assumed to be the same. The actual number of sections is one fewer than the number of posts. More generally, the problem can be stated as follows: The correct answer may be if the line of posts is open-ended, n if they form a loop, or if the posts do not occur at the end of the fence (for instance if the fence runs between two walls). The precise problem definition must be carefully considered, as the setup for one situation may give the wrong answer for other situations. Fencepost errors come from counting things rather than the spaces between them, or vice versa, or by neglecting to consider whether one should count one or both ends of a row. Fencepost errors can also occur in units other than length. For example, the Time Pyramid, consisting of 120 blocks placed at 10-year intervals between blocks, is scheduled to take 1,190 years to build (not 1,200), from the installation of the first block to the last block. One of the earliest fencepost errors involved time, where the Julian calendar originally calculated leap years incorrectly, due to counting inclusively rather than exclusively, yielding a leap year every three years rather than every four. \\"Fencepost error\\" can, in rare occasions, refer to an error induced by unexpected regularities in input values, which can (for instance) completely thwart a theoretically efficient binary tree or hash function implementation. This error involves the difference between expected and worst case behaviours of an algorithm. In larger numbers, being off by one is often not a major issue. In smaller numbers, however, and specific cases where accuracy is paramount committing an off-by-one error can be disastrous. Sometimes such an issue will also be repeated and, therefore, worsened, by someone passing on an incorrect calculation if the following person makes the same kind of mistake again (of course, the error might also be reversed). An example of this error can occur in the computational language MATLAB with the \`linspace()\` linear interpolation function, whose parameters are \`(lower value, upper value, number of values)\` and not \`(lower value, upper value, number of increments)\`. A programmer who misunderstands the third parameter to be the number of increments might hope that \`linspace(0,10,5)\` would achieve a sequence but instead would get .  Security implications  A common off-by- one error which results in a security-related bug is caused by misuse of the C standard library \`strncat\` routine. A common misconception with \`strncat\` is that the guaranteed null termination will not write beyond the maximum length. In reality it will write a terminating null character one byte beyond the maximum length specified. The following code contains such a bug: void foo (char *s) { char buf[15]; memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf)); strncat(buf, s, sizeof(buf)); // Final parameter should be: sizeof(buf)-1 } Off-by-one errors are common in using the C library because it is not consistent with respect to whether one needs to subtract 1 byte – functions like \`fgets()\` and \`strncpy\` will never write past the length given them (\`fgets()\` subtracts 1 itself, and only retrieves (length − 1) bytes), whereas others, like \`strncat\` will write past the length given them. So the programmer has to remember for which functions they need to subtract 1. On some systems (little endian architectures in particular) this can result in the overwriting of the least significant byte of the frame pointer. This can cause an exploitable condition where an attacker can hijack the local variables for the calling routine. One approach that often helps avoid such problems is to use variants of these functions that calculate how much to write based on the total length of the buffer, rather than the maximum number of characters to write. Such functions include \`strlcat\` and \`strlcpy\`, and are often considered \\"safer\\" because they make it easier to avoid accidentally writing past the end of a buffer. (In the code example above, calling \`strlcat(buf, s, sizeof(buf))\` instead would remove the bug.)

Description Quarrendon's site is now a large area of fields and riverside meadows that provide green space between modern housing developments on the outskirts of the town of Aylesbury. Visible in these fields and meadows are the remains of a medieval village, a church, a manor house and its moat and a Tudor water garden. These historic features are now nationally-protected as a Scheduled Monument. The area also has wildlife value with a mixture of habitats and the River Thame forming the southern boundary of the site. The deserted village The layout of the village of Quarrendon in the late middle ages is preserved among the earthworks which can be seen in the area today. At this time the village consisted of farmsteads which were clustered around irregularly shaped greens, linked to each other, to their fields and to Aylesbury by sunken roadways. This village had developed over a long period, centuries, during which time the layout and social structure may have changed. The earthworks which form the visible remains are important but below these there are probably more remnants and artefacts which could be excavated by archaeologists in the future. There are also areas that were significant to the village which are outside the boundaries of the scheduled monument, these areas should also be under appropriate management. An example is that of a field containing ridge- and-furrow, which is an indicator of a medieval open field system of farming. situated between the scheduled monument and Quarrendon House Farm. There are two deserted village sites which are considered to both belong a single medieval settlement which shifted, during the medieval period, from a less suitable location. The smaller of the two sites is west of the ruined building of Church Farm and consists of some platforms used to build houses on and a trackway which runs from east to west across the pasture. On the western edge of the pasture is a considerable flat area crossed by a wide street, this may represent pens and a drove way. The second village site is to the east of the smaller site and it is thought that the villagers of the original settlement shifted to this site. The village was probably abandoned around 1485. The layout of streets and houses is clearly represented by the visible earthworks and show a village which covers with the streets and crofts radiating out from a pond with a mill and a sunken main street, which runs westwards from the village up the hill to the manor. The ruins of a small 13th-century church, St Peters Chapel can also be made out The Tudor manor and water gardens Henry VII] confiscated the lands around Quarrendon from the Earl of Warwick in 1499 and a Crown lease of Quarrendon was granted to Richard Lee. Sir Robert Lee, Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, was Richard Lee's son, and he had a new moated house and garden built on the site, the moat survives and is still partially flooded. Sir Robert's grandson, Sir Henry Lee created an elaborate series of gardens delineated by canals and banks after he inherited Quarrendon in 1549. Sir Henry replaced parts of the deserted medieval village with an elaborate rabbit warren as well as a grand water garden with elevated embanked walkways. After Sir Henry died in 1611 Quarrendon declined and the mansion was replaced by a farm. Earthwork The Royalist forces in the Battle of Aylesbury on 1 November 1642 used an earthwork in the area of Quarrendon.

The series was Searle's most famous work and inspired a popular series of comedy films. Concept Searle published his first St Trinian's School cartoon in 1941 in the magazine Lilliput. Shortly afterward he entered the military as World War II raged on. He was captured at Singapore and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of the Japanese. After the war, in 1946 Searle started making new cartoons about the girls, but the content was much darker compared to the earlier years. The school is the antithesis of the type of posh girls' boarding school depicted by Enid Blyton or Angela Brazil; its female pupils are bad and often well armed, and mayhem is rife. The schoolmistresses are also disreputable. Cartoons often showed dead bodies of girls who had been murdered with pitchforks or succumbed to violent team sports, sometimes with vultures circling; girls drank, gambled and smoked. It is reputed that the gymslip style of dress worn by the girls was closely modelled on the school uniform of James Allen's Girls' School (JAGS) in Dulwich, which Searle's daughter Kate attended. In the 1950s, films were developed that were based on the cartoon series. These comedies implied that the girls at the school were the daughters of dubious characters, such as gangsters, crooks, and shady bookmakers. The institution is often referred to as a \\"female borstal\\", as if it were a reform school. The inspiration { align=right  St Leonard's Hall, Pollock Halls of Residence, University of Edinburgh.

Whilst visiting the family Johnston, he made a drawing to please their two schoolgirl daughters, Cécilé and Pat, (their school had been evacuated to New Gala House in Galashiels in the Scottish Borders owing to the war). Searle was puzzled as to why two schoolgirls should seem so keen to return to their school, an Academy for Young Ladies in Dalkeith Road known as St Trinnean's.Webb, K. The St. Trinian's Story (Penguin Books, 1959)Davies, Russell. Ronald Searle: A Biography (Sinclair-Stevenson, London, 1990) The school was of the experimental sort, and allowed its pupils a certain degree of freedom and autonomy in their own educational choices. The school's original building is now part of the University of Edinburgh. Searle's St Trinian's was based on two independent girls' schools in Cambridge – Perse School for Girls, now known as the co-educational Stephen Perse Foundation, and St Mary's School for girls, formerly a convent. Growing up in Cambridge, Searle regularly saw the girls on their way to and from school; they originally inspired his cartoons and characters. The Perse School for Girls' Archive area holds several original St Trinian's books, given to the school by Ronald Searle. He also based the school partly on the former Cambridgeshire High School for Girls (now Long Road Sixth Form College).here \\"The Cambridge Schoolgirls who inspired \\"St Trinian's\\" During his BBC interviewDessert Island Disks: Ronald Searle BBC - Sounds – Retrieved 20 April 2020 Searle agreed that the cruelty depicted at St Trinian's derived partly from his captivity during World War II but stressed that he included it only because the ignoble aspect to warfare in general had become more widely known.

Searle's cartoons appeared in the films' main title design. In the films the school became embroiled in various shady enterprises, thanks mainly to Flash, and, as a result, was always threatened with closure by the Ministry. (In the last of the original four, this became the \\"Ministry of Schools\\", possibly because of fears of a libel action from a real Minister of Education.) The first four films form a chronological quartet, and were produced by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat. They had earlier produced The Happiest Days of Your Life (1950), a stylistically similar school comedy, starring Alastair Sim, Joyce Grenfell, George Cole, Richard Wattis, Guy Middleton, and Bernadette O'Farrell, all of whom later appeared in the St Trinian's series, often playing similar characters. Barchester and Barset were used as names for the fictional towns near which St Trinian's School was supposedly located in the original films. In Blue Murder at St Trinian's, a signpost was marked as 2 miles to Barset, 8 miles to Wantage, indicating a location in what was then Berkshire, now Oxfordshire. St Trinian's is depicted as an unorthodox girls' school where the younger girls wreak havoc and the older girls express their femininity overtly, turning their shapeless schoolgirl dress into something sexy and risqué by the standards of the times. St Trinian's is often invoked in discussions about groups of schoolgirls running amok. The St Trinian's girls themselves come in two categories: the Fourth Form, most closely resembling Searle's original drawings of ink- stained, ungovernable pranksters, and the much older Sixth Form, sexually precocious to a degree that may have seemed alarming to some in 1954. In the films, the Fourth Form includes a number of much younger girls who are the most ferocious of them all. It is something of a rule of thumb that the smaller a St Trinian's is, the more dangerous she is—especially when armed, most commonly with a lacrosse or hockey stick—though none of them can ever be considered harmless. In the first two films, St Trinian's is presided over by the genial Miss Millicent Fritton (Sim in drag), whose philosophy is summed up as: \\"In other schools girls are sent out quite unprepared into a merciless world, but when our girls leave here, it is the merciless world which has to be prepared.\\" Later other headmistresses included Dora Bryan in The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery. In December 2007, a new film, St Trinian's, was released. The cast included Rupert Everett, Colin Firth, Russell Brand, Lily Cole, Talulah Riley, Stephen Fry, and Gemma Arterton. Reviews were mixed. A second new St Trinian's film, St Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold, was released in 2009. ; The first series # The Belles of St Trinian's (1954) # Blue Murder at St Trinian's (1957) # The Pure Hell of St Trinian's (1960) # The Great St Trinian's Train Robbery (1966) ; The first reboot * The Wildcats of St Trinian's (1980, with Maureen Lipman taking on the Joyce Grenfell role) ; The second reboot # St Trinian's (2007) # St Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold (2009) =Coat of arms= The school's coat of arms was originally shown as a black skull-and-crossbones on a field of white. This was later changed to a white tau cross (symbolising the \\"T\\" in Trinian's) on a black field bordered white. =School motto= The school has no fixed motto but has had several suggested ones. The school's motto is depicted in the original movies from the 1950s and 1960s as In flagrante delicto (\\"Caught in the Act\\"). This can be seen on the trophy shelf, above the stairs in The Belles of St Trinian's (1954). The lyrics of the original theme song by Sidney Gilliat (c. 1954) implies that the school's motto is \\"Get your blow in first\\" (Semper debeatis percutis ictu primo). A poem in one of Searle's books called \\"St Trinian's Soccer Song\\", by D. B. Wyndham Lewis and Johnny Dankworth, states the motto is Floreat St Trinian's (\\"May St Trinian's Bloom/Flourish\\"), a sly reference to the motto of Eton (Floreat Etona—\\"May Eton Flourish\\"). =School songs= The musical score for the St Trinian films was written by Malcolm Arnold and included the school song, with words accredited to Sidney Gilliat (1954). In the 2007 film, a new school song, written by Girls Aloud, was called \\"Defenders of Anarchy\\". The school also has a fight song.

The drive itself is the same size as a standard 3.5\\" floppy drive, but uses an ATA interface. On the right is the USB-to-ATA adapter, which plugs into an intermediate fan-out and power supply daughterboard that is inside the rear of the Mac drive's casing. This particular drive cannot function using USB power alone. This shows the technology of the SuperDisk drive. Two voice coil servomotors move the drive heads precisely across the disk surface. BLUE - The main servo with a large coil provides the primary force to move the head mechanism. YELLOW - A secondary smaller coil primarily acts to keep the head mechanism aligned parallel with the disk surface. RED - The drive eject motor allows the disk to be under computer control so that it normally will not eject until the computer has completed its read or writing tasks. The SuperDisk LS-120 is a high-speed, high-capacity alternative to the 90 mm (3.5 in), 1.44 MB floppy disk. The SuperDisk hardware was created by 3M's storage products group Imation in 1997, with manufacturing chiefly by Matsushita. The SuperDisk had little success in North America; with Compaq, Gateway and Dell being three of only a few OEMs who supported it. It was more successful in Asia and Australia, where the second-generation SuperDisk LS-240 drive and disk was released. SuperDisk worldwide ceased manufacturing in 2003. History The design of the SuperDisk system came from an early 1990s project at Iomega. It is one of the last examples of floptical technology, where lasers are used to guide a magnetic head which is much smaller than those used in traditional floppy disk drives. Iomega orphaned the project around the time they decided to release the Zip drive in 1994. The idea eventually ended up at 3M, where the concept was refined and the design was licensed to established floppy drive makers Matsushita and Mitsubishi. Other companies involved in the development of SuperDisk include Compaq and OR Technology. Matsushita continued development of the technology and released the LS-240. It has double the capacity of the LS-120 and the added feature of being able to format regular floppy disks to 32 MB capacity. However, this higher density comes at a price – the entire disk must be rewritten any time a change is made, much like early CD-RW media. A SuperDisk drive was used in two Panasonic digital cameras, the PV-SD4090 and PV-SD5000, which allowed them to use both SuperDisk (LS120) and 3.5\\" floppy disks as the memory media. Technical information The SuperDisk's format was designed to supersede the floppy disk with its higher-capacity media that imitated the ubiquitous format with its own 120 MB (and later 240 MB) disk storage while the SuperDisk drive itself was backwards compatible with 1.44 MB and 720 KB floppy formats (MFM). Superdisk drives read and write faster to these sorts of disks than conventional 1.44 MB or 720 KB floppy drives. The newer LS-240 drives also have the ability to read and write regular 1.44 MB floppies at much higher densities. The true capacity of these \\"SD120MB\\" driveshttps://lkml.org/lkml/2000/3/12/171 LKML Boot Messages is 120.375 MiB aka 126.22 MB (FAT16B with logical geometry 963/8/32 CHS × 512 bytes). The \\"SD240MB\\" drives have a capacity of 229.25 MiB aka 240.39 MB (FAT16B with logical geometry 262/32/56 CHS × 512 bytes). 1.44 MB HD floppies formatted to 32 MB as \\"FD32MB\\" (FAT16B with logical geometry 1024/2/32 CHS × 512 bytes) in the LS-240 show a dummy FAT12 file system (with logical geometries 160/2/9 or 80/2/18) when inserted into a normal floppy drive. SuperDisk drives have been sold in parallel port, USB, ATAPI and SCSI variants. All drives can read and write 1.44 MB and 720 KiB MFM floppies, as used on PCs, Apple Macintoshes (High Density format only, see below), and many workstations. 2.88 MB floppy formats are not supported. Imation also released a version of the SuperDisk with \\"Secured Encryption Technology\\", which uses Blowfish with a 64-bit key to encrypt the contents.

These disks could be used in a SuperDisk drive only if formatted to PC 720 KB MFM format. Note that almost no other USB floppy drives supported Mac GCR floppies. The biggest hurdle standing in the way of success was that Iomega's Zip drive had been out for three years when SuperDisk had been released. Zip had enough popularity to leave the public mostly uninterested in SuperDisk, despite its superior design and its compatibility with the standard floppy disk. By 2000, the entire removable magnetic disk category was finally obsoleted by the falling prices of CD-R and CD-RW drives, and later on solid- state (USB flash drives or USB keydrives). Over the next few years, SuperDisk was quietly discontinued, even in areas where it was popular. Today, disks are very hard to find. Under Windows XP, a USB SuperDisk drive will appear as a 3.5\\" floppy disk drive, receiving either the drive letter A: (if there is no floppy in the machine) or B: (if there already is one). This enables use by software that expects a floppy drive when 1.44 MB or 720 KB disks are inserted. 120 MB and 240 MB disks are also accessed via A: or B:. Practicality The USB models were quite popular for debugging and installing servers that did not have a CD drive available. They could both store massive numbers of drivers for installation purposes as well as be used to run live operating systems, such as ReactOS, which amounts to 150 MB.

He had been an opponent of John Chrysostom and helped Arsacius of Tarsus depose him, but later became a supporter of him after his death. He rebuilt the small church that was located on the site of the later Hagia Sophia, and was an opponent of the Pelagians, which helped increase his popularity among the citizens of Constantinople. Biography Born at Sebaste in Armenia, he early embraced a monastic life, and received his education from some Macedonian monks near that place. Removing to Constantinople, he adopted the orthodox faith, was ordained presbyter, and soon became known as a rising man. He proved himself one of Chrysostom's most bitter adversaries. If not, as Palladius of Galatia asserts, cites Palladius c. xi. the architect of the whole cabal, he certainly took a very leading part in carrying it into execution. The organization of the Synod of the Oak owed much to his practical skill. cites Phot. Cod. 59. The expulsion of Chrysostom took place 10 June 404. His successor, the aged Arsacius, died 5 November 405. Four months of intrigue ended in the selection of Atticus.Baring-Gould, Sabine. “Saint Atticus, Patriarch of Constantinople”. Lives of the Saints, 1897. CatholicSaints.Info. 7 January 2014 Vigorous measures were at once adopted by Atticus in conjunction with the other members of the triumvirate to which the Eastern church had been subjected, Theophilus of Alexandria, and Porphyry of Antioch, to crush the adherents of Chrysostom. An imperial rescript was obtained imposing the severest penalties on all who dared to reject the communion of the patriarchs. A large number of the bishops of the East persevered in the refusal, and suffered a cruel persecution; while even the inferior clergy and laity were compelled to keep themselves in concealment or to fly the country. The small minority of Eastern bishops who for peace's sake deserted Chrysostom's cause were made to feel the guilt of having once supported it, being compelled to leave their sees and take other dioceses in the inhospitable regions of Thrace, where they might be more under Atticus's eye and hand. cites Socr. vii. 36; Niceph. xiii. 30; Palled. c. xx. Unity seemed hardly nearer when the death of Chrysostom (14 September 407) removed the original ground of the schism. A large proportion of the Christian population of Constantinople still refused communion with the usurper, and continued to hold their religious assemblies, more numerously attended than the churches, in the open air in the suburbs of the city, cites Niceph. xiv. 23, 27. until Chrysostom's name took its place on the registers and in the public prayers of the church of Constantinople. Atticus's endeavours were vigorously directed to the maintenance and enlargement of the authority of the see of Constantinople. He obtained a rescript from emperor Theodosius II subjecting to it the whole of Illyria and the \\"Provincia Orientalis.\\" This gave great offence to Pope Boniface I and the emperor Honorius, and the decree was never put into execution. Another rescript declaring his right to decide on and approve of the election of all the bishops of the province was more effectual. Silvanus was named by him bishop of Philippopolis, and afterwards removed to Alexandria Troas. Atticus asserted his right to ordain in Bithynia, and put it in practice at Nicaea in 425. cites Socr. vii. 25, 28, 37. Teachings Atticus displayed great vigour in combating and repressing heresy. He wrote to the bishops of Pamphylia and to Amphilochius of Iconium, calling on them to drive out the Messalians (Phot. c. 52). The zeal and energy he displayed against the Pelagians are highly commended by Pope Celestine I, who goes so far as to style him \\"a true successor of St. Chrysostom\\".; Philippe Labbe, Concilia iii. 353, 361, 365, 1073; cf. S. Prosper. p. 549; S. Leo. Ep. xxi.Leo, the Great, Ep. XXI Theod. Ep. cxlv.Theodoret, Ep. 145). His writings were quoted as those of an orthodox teacher by the councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon. cites Labbe, iii. 518, iv. 831. Atticus was more an actor than a writer; and of what he did publish little remains. A treatise On Virginity, combating by anticipation the errors of Nestorius, addressed to emperor Theodosius I's daughters Pulcheria and her sisters, is mentioned by Marcellinus. cites Marcellinus Chron. sub ann. 416, and Gennadius, de Scrip. Eccl. c. 53Gennadius, ch. LIII Socrates Scholasticus, who is a partial witness, attributes to him a sweet and winning disposition which caused him to be regarded with much affection. Those who thought with him found in him a warm friend and supporter. Towards his theological adversaries he at first showed great severity, and after they submitted, changed his behaviour and won them by gentleness. cites Socr. vii. 41; Soz. viii. 27. Veneration He is highly regarded for his charity and piety and is venerated as a Saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, which observes his feast on 8 January.

Along with other Adventist leaders such as Joseph Bates and her husband James White, she was instrumental within a small group of early Adventists who formed what became known as the Seventh-day Adventist Church. White is considered a leading figure in American vegetarian history. The Smithsonian magazine named Ellen G. White among the \\"100 Most Significant Americans of All Time. White's writings still influence people today. White claimed to have received over 2,000 visions and dreams from God in public and private meetings throughout her life, which were witnessed by Adventist pioneers and the general public. She verbally described and published for public consumption the content of the alleged visions. The Adventist pioneers viewed these experiences as the Biblical gift of prophecy as outlined in and which describe the testimony of Jesus as the \\"spirit of prophecy.\\" Her Conflict of the Ages series of writings endeavor to showcase the hand of God in Biblical history and in church history. This cosmic conflict, referred to by Seventh-day Adventist theologians as the \\"Great Controversy theme,\\" became foundational to the development of Seventh-day Adventist theology. Her book on successful Christian living, Steps to Christ, has been published in more than 140 languages. The book Child Guidance, a compilation of her writings about child care, training and education, has been used as the foundation for the Seventh- day Adventist school system. White was considered a controversial figure by her critics, with much of the controversy centering on her reports of visionary experiences and on the use of other sources in her writings. Historian Randall Balmer has described White as \\"one of the more important and colorful figures in the history of American religion\\". Walter Martin described her as \\"one of the most fascinating and controversial personages ever to appear upon the horizon of religious history\\". Arthur L. White, her grandson and biographer, writes that Ellen G. White is the most translated female non- fiction author in the history of literature, as well as the most translated American non-fiction author of either gender. Her writings covered a broad range of subjects, including religion, social relationships, prophecy, publishing, nutrition, creationism, agriculture, theology, evangelism, Christian lifestyle, education, and health. She advocated vegetarianism. She promoted and has been instrumental in the establishment of schools and medical centers all over the world, with the most renowned being Andrews University in Michigan and the Loma Linda University and Medical Center in California. During her lifetime she wrote more than 5,000 periodical articles and 40 books. more than 200 White titles are available in English, including compilations from her 100,000 pages of manuscript published by the Ellen G. White Estate, which are accessible at the Adventist Book Center. Her most notable books are Steps to Christ, The Desire of Ages and The Great Controversy. Personal life =Early life= Ellen and her twin sister Elizabeth were born November 26, 1827, to Robert and Eunice Harmon at a home on Rte. 114 in Gorham, Maine. She was the seventh of eight children. Robert was a farmer who also made hats using mercuric nitrate. Charles E. Dudley, Sr., in his book The Genealogy of Ellen Gould Harmon White: The Prophetess of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and the Story of the Growth and Development of the Seventh-day Adventist Denomination As It Relates to African-Americans claims that Ellen White had an African-American ancestry. In March 2000, the Ellen G. White Estate commissioned Roger D. Joslyn, a professional genealogist, to research Ellen G. White's ancestry. Joslyn concluded that she was of Anglo-Saxon origin. At the age of nine, White was hit in the face with a stone. This occurred while she was living in Portland, Maine, and probably attending the Bracket Street School. This, she said, started her conversion: \\"This misfortune, which for a time seemed so bitter and was so hard to bear, has proved to be a blessing in disguise. The cruel blow which blighted the joys of earth, was the means of turning my eyes to heaven. I might never had known Jesus Christ, had not the sorrow that clouded my early years led me to seek comfort in him\\". A few years after her injury, Ellen, with her parents, attended a Methodist camp meeting at Buxton, Maine; and there, at the age of 12, a breakthrough occurred in which she had a conversion experience and felt at peace. =Millerite movement= In 1840, at age 12, her family became involved with the Millerite movement. As she attended William Miller's lectures, she felt guilty for her sins and was filled with terror about being eternally lost. She describes herself as spending nights in tears and prayer and being in this condition for several months. On June 26, 1842, she was baptized by John Hobart in Casco Bay in Portland, Maine, and eagerly awaited Jesus to come again. In her later years, she referred to this as the happiest time of her life. Her family's involvement with Millerism caused them to be disfellowshipped by the local Methodist church. =Marriage and family= Sometime in 1845 Ellen Harmon came in contact with her future husband James Springer White, a Millerite who became convinced that her visions were genuine. A year later James proposed and they were married by a justice of the peace in Portland, Maine, on August 30, 1846. James later wrote: > We were married August 30, 1846, and from that hour to the present she has > been my crown of rejoicing ... It has been in the good providence of God > that both of us had enjoyed a deep experience in the Advent movement ... > This experience was now needed as we should join our forces and, united, > labor extensively from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific ...Life Sketches, > 1880 edition, 126, 127. The Whites had four sons: Henry Nichols, James Edson (known as Edson), William Clarence (known as Willie or W. C.), and John Herbert. Only Edson and William lived to adulthood. John Herbert died of erysipelas at the age of two months, and Henry died of pneumonia at the age of 16 [White Estate Biography] in 1863. =Final years and death= left Oak Hill Cemetery-James and Ellen White White spent the final years of her life in Elmshaven, her home in Saint Helena, California after the death of her husband James White in 1881. During her final years she traveled less frequently as she concentrated upon writing her last works for the church. She died on July 16, 1915, at her home in Elmshaven, which is now an Adventist Historical Site. After three funerals, she was buried with her husband James White in Oak Hill Cemetery, Battle Creek, Michigan. Ministry =Visions= From 1844 to 1863 White allegedly experienced between 100 and 200 visions, typically in public places and meeting halls. She experienced her first vision soon after the Millerite Great Disappointment of 1844.Adventist History Library's Ellen White's First Vision includes the various printed editions of her first vision. She said she had one that led to the writing of The Great Controversy at an Ohio funeral service held on a Sunday afternoon in March 1858, in the Lovett's Grove (now Bowling Green) public school, an alleged vision of the ages-long conflict between Christ and His angels and Satan and his angels was given to Mrs. White. Physical phenomena during visions J. N. Loughborough, who had seen White in vision 50 times since 1852, and her husband, James White, listed several physical characteristics that marked the visions: #\\"In passing into vision, she gives three enrapturing shouts of \\"Glory!\\" which echo and re-echo, the second, and especially the third, fainter but more thrilling than the first, the voice resembling that of one quite a distance from you, and just going out of hearing.\\" #For a few moments she would swoon, having no strength. Then she would be instantly filled with superhuman strength, sometimes rising to her feet and walking about the room. She frequently moved hands, arms, and head in gestures that were free and graceful. But to whatever position she moved a hand or arm, it could not be hindered nor controlled by even the strongest person. In 1845, she held her parents' 18.5 pound family Bible in her outstretched left hand for half an hour. She weighed 80 pounds at the time. #She did not breathe during the entire period of a vision that ranged from fifteen minutes to three hours. Yet, her pulse beat regularly and her countenance remained pleasant as in the natural state. #Her eyes were always open without blinking; her head was raised, looking upward with a pleasant expression as if staring intently at some distant object. Several physicians, at different times, conducted tests to check her lack of breathing and other physical phenomena. #She was utterly unconscious of everything transpiring around her, and viewed herself as removed from this world, and in the presence of heavenly beings. #When she came out of vision, all seemed total darkness whether in the day time or a well-lighted room at night. She would exclaim with a long-drawn sigh, as she took her first natural breath, \\"D-a-r-k.\\" She was then limp and strengthless. Mrs. Martha Amadon added: \\"There was never an excitement among those present during a vision; nothing caused fear. It was a solemn, quiet scene.\\" First vision In December 1844, White allegedly experienced her first vision during a prayer meeting at the home of Mrs. Haines at 60 Ocean Street in South Portland, Maine, which later became the Griffin Club > At this time I visited one of our Advent sisters, and in the morning we > bowed around the family altar. It was not an exciting occasion, and there > were but five of us present, all females. While praying, the power of God > came upon me as I never had felt it before, and I was wrapt up in a vision > of God's glory, and seemed to be rising higher and higher from the earth and > was shown something of the travels of the Advent people to the Holy City > ...White, Arthur L. 1985, \\"Chapter 7 – (1846–1847) Entering Marriage Life\\", > Ellen G. White: The Early Years, Vol. 1 1827–1862, page 56 In this vision the \\"Advent people\\" were traveling a high and dangerous path towards the city of New Jerusalem [heaven]. Their path was lit from behind by \\"a bright (light) ... which an angel told me was the midnight cry.\\" Some of the travelers grew weary and were encouraged by Jesus; others denied the light, the light behind them went out, and they fell \\"off the path into the dark and wicked world below.\\"White, Arthur L. 1985, \\"Chapter 7 – (1846–1847) Entering Marriage Life\\", Ellen G. White: The Early Years, Vol. 1 1827–1862, page 57 The vision continued with a portrayal of Christ's second coming, following which the Advent people entered the New Jerusalem; and ended with her returning to earth feeling lonely, desolate and longing for that \\"better world.\\" As Godfrey T. Anderson said, \\"In effect, the vision assured the Advent believers of eventual triumph despite the immediate despair into which they had plunged.\\"Godfrey T. Anderson, \\"Sectarianism and Organisation, 1846–1864,\\" in Adventism in America: a History, ed. Gary Land (Berrien Springs: Andrews University Press, 1998), 31. Second and third visions In February 1845, White allegedly experienced her second vision in Exeter, Maine known as the \\"Bridegroom\\" vision. Together with the third vision about the new earth, the visions \\"gave continued meaning to the October 1844 experience and supported the developing sanctuary rationale. Additionally they played an important role in countering the spiritualizing views of many fanatical Adventists by portraying the Father and Jesus as literal beings and heaven as a physical place.\\"Merlin D. Burt, \\"The Historical Background, Interconnected Development, and Integration of the Doctrines of the Heavenly Sanctuary, the Sabbath, and Ellen G. White's Role in Sabbatarian Adventism from 1844–1849\\", PhD, Andrews University, 2002, 170. Public testimony Fearing people would not accept her testimony, White did not initially share her visions with the wider Millerite community. In a meeting at her parents' home when she received what she regarded as confirmation of her ministry: > While praying, the thick darkness that had enveloped me was scattered, a > bright light, like a ball of fire, came towards me, and as it fell upon me, > my strength was taken away. I seemed to be in the presence of Jesus and the > angels. Again it was repeated, 'Make known to others what I have revealed to > you.'White, Arthur L. 1985, \\"Chapter 7 – (1846–1847) Entering Marriage > Life\\", Ellen G. White: The Early Years, Vol. 1 1827–1862, page 63 Soon White was giving her testimony in public meetings — some of which she arranged herself — and in her regular Methodist class meetings in private homes. > I arranged meetings with my young friends, some of whom were considerably > older than myself, and a few were married persons. A number of them were > vain and thoughtless; my experience sounded to them like an idle tale, and > they did not heed my entreaties. But I determined that my efforts should > never cease till these dear souls, for whom I had so great an interest, > yielded to God. Several entire nights were spent by me in earnest prayer for > those whom I had sought out and brought together for the purpose of laboring > and praying with them.Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church Vol.1, > (1855–1868) News of her visions spread and White was soon traveling and speaking to groups of Millerite followers in Maine and the surrounding area. Her visions were not publicized further afield until January 24, 1846, when her account of the first vision: \\"Letter From Sister Harmon\\" was published in the Day Star, a Millerite paper published in Cincinnati, Ohio by Enoch Jacobs. White had written to Jacobs to encourage him and although she stated the letter was not written for publication,Day Star. Letter from Sister Harmon, Falmouth Mass., Feb., 15, 1846 Jacobs printed it anyway. Through the next few years it was republished in various forms and is included as part of her first book, Christian Experience and Views, published in 1851. Two Millerites claimed to have had visions prior to White – William Ellis Foy (1818–1893), and Hazen Foss (1818?–1893), White's brother-in-law. Adventists believe the prophetic gift offered to these two men was passed on to White when they rejected it. =Middle life= White described the vision experience as involving a bright light which would surround her and she felt herself in the presence of Jesus or angels who would show her events (historical and future) and places (on earth, in heaven, or other planets). The transcriptions of White's visions generally contain theology, prophecy, or personal counsels to individuals or to Adventist leaders. One of the best examples of her personal counsels is found in a 9-volume series of books entitled Testimonies for the Church, that contains edited testimonies published for the general edification of the church. The spoken and written versions of her visions played a significant part in establishing and shaping the organizational structure of the emerging Adventist Church. Her visions and writings continue to be used by church leaders in developing the church's policies and for devotional reading. On March 14, 1858, at Lovett's Grove, near Bowling Green, Ohio, White received a vision while attending a funeral service. On that day James White wrote that \\"God manifested His power in a wonderful manner\\" adding that \\"several had decided to keep the Lord's Sabbath and go with the people of God.\\" In writing about the vision, she stated that she received practical instruction for church members, and more significantly, a cosmic sweep of the conflict \\"between Christ and His angels, and Satan and his angels.\\" Ellen White would expand upon this great controversy theme which would eventually culminate in the Conflict of the Ages series. Personality and public persona White was seen as a powerful and sought after preacher.See Horace Shaw's doctoral dissertation, \\"A Rhetorical Analysis of the Speaking of Mrs. Ellen G. White, A Pioneer Leader and Spokeswoman of the Seventh-day Adventist Church\\" (Michigan State University, 1959), p282.Chapter 12: \\"The Sought-for Speaker\\" in Messenger of the Lord by Herbert Douglass While she has been perceived as having a strict and serious personality, perhaps due to her lifestyle standards, numerous sources describe her as a friendly person.See Walking With Ellen White: The Human Interest Story by George R.

White recounts happy childhood memories of her Major teachings =Theology= * Christ-centered salvation by grace\\"My soul was daily drinking rich draughts of salvation. I thought that those who loved Jesus would love His coming, so went to the class meeting and told them what Jesus had done for me and what a fullness I enjoyed through believing that the Lord was coming. The class leader interrupted me, saying, \\"Through Methodism\\"; but I could not give the glory to Methodism when it was Christ and the hope of His soon coming that had made me free.\\" Early Writings Pg. 13 * The Great Controversy theme * Obedience to revealed truth a sign of genuine faithA Word to the Little Flock Jerry Moon argues that White taught assurance of salvation.http://www.andrews.edu/~jmoon/Documents/GSEM_534/Class_outline/08.pdf Arthur Patrick believes that White was evangelical, in that she had high regard for the Bible, saw the cross as central, supported righteousness by faith, believed in Christian activism, and sought to restore New Testament Christianity.Arthur Patrick, \\"An Adventist and an Evangelical in Australia? The Case of Ellen White In The 1890s.\\" in Lucas: An Evangelical History Review No. 12, December 1991 Ellen White avoided using the word \\"Trinity\\", \\"and her husband stated categorically that her visions did not support the Trinitarian creed.\\" Her theology did not include a doctrine of the Trinity. It has however been demonstrated, by Jerry Moon in The Adventist Trinity Debate, that although her earlier visions and writings do not clearly reveal the Three Persons of the Godhead, her later works strongly bring out the teaching of \\"the Third Person of the Godhead.\\" =Education= White's earliest essays on education appeared in the 1872 autumn editions of the Health Reformer. In her first essay she stated that working with youthful minds was the most delicate of tasks. The manner of instruction should be varied. This would make it possible for the \\"high and noble powers of the mind\\" to have a chance to develop. To be qualified to educate the youth (she wrote), parents and teachers must have self-control, gentleness and love. White's idea of creating a Christian educational system and its importance in society is detailed in her writings Christian Education (1893, 1894) and Education (1903). =Health reform= White expounded greatly on the subjects of health, healthy eating and a balanced diet. In her book Counsels on Diet & Foods, she gives advice on the right foods and on moderation. She also warns against the use of tobacco, which was medically accepted in her day. Her views are expressed in the writings Healthful Living (1897, 1898) and The Health Food Ministry (1970) and The Ministry of Healing (1905). Major writings White's books include: * The Great Controversy, describing the history of sin from beginning to end. * Steps to Christ (1892), a classic, concise (evangelical) treatment of personal devotional topics. * Christ's Object Lessons (1900), about the parables of Jesus. * Education (1903), principles of Christian education * The Ministry of Healing (1905), instructions on healthy living and the care of others. * Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing (1896), about Christ's Sermon on the Mount. A survey conducted in 2016 found that White was the 11th most-read author in Brazil. Historic legacy According to one evangelical author, \\"No Christian leader or theologian has exerted as great an influence on a particular denomination as Ellen White has on Adventism.\\"CRI Journal – CRJ0005B Additional authors have stated \\"Ellen G. White has undoubtedly been the most influential Seventh-day Adventist in the history of the church.\\"Meeting Ellen White: a fresh look at her life, writings, and major themes by George R. KnightAdventist ABC Bookstore Last Day Events =Ellen G. White Estate= The Ellen G. White Estate, Inc., was formed as a result of White's will.Last Will and Testament of Ellen G. White It consists of a self- perpetuating board and a staff which includes a secretary (now known as the director), several associates, and a support staff. The main headquarters is at the Seventh-day Adventist General Conference headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland. Branch Offices are located at Andrews University, Loma Linda University, and Oakwood University. There are 15 additional research centers located throughout the 13 remaining divisions of the world church. The mission of the White Estate is to circulate Ellen White's writings, translate them, and provide resources for helping to better understand her life and ministry. At the Toronto General Conference Session (2000) the world church expanded the mission of the White Estate to include a responsibility for promoting Adventist history for the entire denomination. =Adventist historic sites= Elmshaven Historic Adventist Village-Home of James and Ellen White (lateral) Several of White's homes are historic sites. The first home that she and her husband owned is now part of the Historic Adventist Village in Battle Creek, Michigan.Adventist Heritage Site Her other homes are privately owned with the exception of her home in Cooranbong, Australia, which she named \\"Sunnyside,\\" and her last home in Saint Helena, California, which she named \\"Elmshaven\\".Elmshaven website These latter two homes are owned by the Seventh- day Adventist Church and the \\"Elmshaven\\" home is also a National Historic Landmark. =Avondale College= White inspired and guided the foundation of Avondale College, Cooranbong, leaving an educational legacy from her time in Australia. Avondale College is the main Seventh-day Adventist tertiary institution in the South-Pacific Division. Biographical writings Ellen White wrote her own biography first published in 1851 as A Sketch of the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G. White. This she expanded in 1880 as Life Sketches of James White and Ellen G. White which was later expanded again by White and several authors who covered the remainder of her life, published in 1915 it remains in print as Life Sketches of Ellen G. White (abbreviated as LS). The most comprehensive biography of White is an extensive six-volume work called \\"Ellen G. White: A Biography\\" written by her grandson, Arthur L. White. Thousands of articles and books have been written about various aspects of Ellen G. White's life and ministry. A large number of these can be found in the libraries at Loma Linda University and Andrews University, the two primary Seventh-day Adventist institutions with major research collections about Adventism. An \\"Encyclopedia of Ellen G. White\\" is being produced by two faculty at Andrews University: Jerry Moon,Jerry Moon Faculty bio at Andrews University chair of the church history department, and Denis Fortin,Denis Fortin Faculty bio at Andrews University dean of the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary. =Theatre= Red Books: Our Search for Ellen White is a play about White, a co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and the various perceptions of her throughout the history of the church. It was produced by the Dramatic Arts Society of Pacific Union College in California. It was based on interviews collected from over 200 individuals. The title derives from White's books, which were traditionally bound with a red cover.Red Books: Our Search for Ellen White. Reviewed by Adrian Zytkoskee =Film= Produced by the Seventh-Day Adventist church in 2016, the movie Tell the World chronicles the life of Ellen G. White, \\"Her guidance and advice, obtained through Bible studies, as well as dreams and visions revealed by God, guided the steps of the Church in becoming a worldwide movement of compassion in the areas of health, education, community development and disaster relief.\\" Today, the Seventh-day Adventist church has grown to nearly 20 million members in hundreds of countries. Examination of the prophetic value of her writings Most Adventists believe White's writings are inspired and continue to have relevance for the church today. Because of criticism from the evangelical community, in the 1940s and 1950s church leaders such as LeRoy Edwin Froom and Roy Allan Anderson attempted to help evangelicals understand Seventh-day Adventists better by engaging in extended dialogue that resulted in the publication of Questions on Doctrine (1956) that explained Adventist beliefs in evangelical language. Evangelical Walter Martin of the countercult Christian Research Institute \\"rejected White's prophetic claims,\\" yet saw her \\"as a genuine Christian believer,\\" unlike her contemporaries Joseph Smith, Mary Baker Eddy, and Charles Taze Russell. Kenneth Samples, a successor of Martin in his interaction with Adventism, also denies White's prophetic claims yet \\"believe[s] she, at minimum, had some good biblical and theological instincts.\\"Samples, Kenneth (2007). \\"Evangelical Reflections on Seventh-day Adventism: Yesterday and Today.\\" Questions on Doctrine 50th anniversary conference =Adventist statement of belief about the Spirit of Prophecy= White's writings are sometimes referred to as the Spirit of Prophecy by Adventists. The term is dually applied to the Holy Spirit which inspired her writings. Early Sabbatarian Adventists, many of whom had come out of the Christian Connexion, were anti-creedal. However, as early as 1872 Adventists produced a statement of Adventist beliefs. This list was refined during the 1890s and formally included in the SDA Yearbook in 1931 with 22 points. In 1980 a statement of 27 Fundamental Beliefs was adopted, to which one was added to in 2005 to make the current list of fundamental beliefs. White is referenced in the fundamental belief on spiritual gifts. This doctrinal statement says: > One of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying > mark of the remnant church and was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. > White. As the Lord's messenger, her writings are a continuing and > authoritative source of truth which provide for the church comfort, > guidance, instruction, and correction. They also make clear that the Bible > is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. (; ; ; > ; .)Fundamental Beliefs  Criticism  Critics have voiced doubts as to the reliability of Ellen G. White as a prophet and the authenticity of her visions. Ronald L. Numbers, an American historian of science and a graduate of the Loma Linda University School of Medicine, criticized Mrs. White for her views on health and masturbation, the gist of his criticism being that she followed the medical consensus of her epoch. Numbers argues that she plagiarized vitalist writers (such as Horace Mann and Larkin B. Coles) for her arguments against masturbation.Numbers (2008:213–214) White's book Appeal to Mothers states that she did not copy her text from the health reform advocates and that she independently reached such conclusions.Numbers (2008:211) Numbers' criticism is acknowledged as significant by the staff of the White Estate, which sought to refute it in A Critique of the Book Prophetess of Health.The Staff of the Ellen G. White Estate A Critique of the Book Prophetess of Health, 2008. Upon the criticism of Mrs. White's views on masturbation see p. 72 of the publication. Richard W. Schwarz from the Department of History, Andrews University argued that the similarities are due to supernatural inspiration influencing all those authors, which spoke in more or less the same words to all of them.The Staff of the Ellen G. White Estate A Critique of the Book Prophetess of Health, third edition (2008), p. 9 Roger Coon wrote a lecture arguing that certain followers of the religion were engaging in \\"equal but opposite dangers\\" in their view of White. He described one group that overdeified her, and one group that \\"picks and chooses\\" from what teachings they follow of hers. Critics have accused Ellen White of plagiarism. One such was Walter T. Rea, who argued against the \\"original\\" nature of her alleged revelations in his book The White Lie. In response, The White Estate released a document to refute claims presented in The White Lie. An attorney who specializes in patent, trademark, and copyright cases, Vincent L. Ramik, undertook a study of Ellen G. White's writings during the early 1980s, and concluded that they were \\"conclusively unplagiaristic.\\" When the plagiarism charge ignited a significant debate during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Adventist General Conference commissioned a major study by Dr. Fred Veltman. The ensuing project became known as the \\"'Life of Christ' Research Project.\\"General Conference Archives of the Seventh-day Adventist Church Dr. Roger W. Coon,Ellen G.

White as a Writer: Case Studies in the Issue of Literary BorrowingThe Ellen G. White Encyclopedia King and Morgan, among others, undertook the refutation of the accusations of plagiarism. At the conclusion of his report, Ramik states: > It is impossible to imagine that the intention of Ellen G. White, as > reflected in her writings and the unquestionably prodigious efforts involved > therein, was anything other than a sincerely motivated and unselfish effort > to place the understandings of Biblical truths in a coherent form for all to > see and comprehend.

Ramik cleared her of breaking the law of the land and time (copyright infringement/piracy).The Ramik Report Memorandum of Law Literary Property Rights 1790 – 1915 In 1911, more than 70 years before charges of plagiarism, White wrote in the introduction to The Great Controversy her reason for quoting, in some cases without giving due credit, certain historians whose \\"statements afford a ready and forcible presentation on the subject.\\" Cf. The Great Controversy, p. xi.4 1911 edition. That means that she acknowledged the charges of “uncredited paraphrasing,” a common literary practice of her time.McArthur (2008: 48). Quote: \\"Rather, he was always at pains to emphasize that Mrs. White herself acknowledged indebtedness in the book's Introduction:\\" Spectrum (magazine), a liberal Adventist publication known for its dissent and heterodoxy, claims that, due to the plagiarism scandal, \\"at least the educated mainstream church\\" (\\"church\\" meaning SDA church) no longer buys into the claim of White's \\"verbal inspiration\\".

It is situated about south of Wareham and west of Swanage. In 2013 the estimated population of the civil parish was 90. Kimmeridge is a coastal parish and its coastline forms part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. The coast is also part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and the whole parish is part of the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Kimmeridge is the type locality for Kimmeridge clay, the geological formation that covers most of the parish. Within the clay are bands of bituminous shale, which in the history of the village have been the focus of several attempts to create an industrial centre. An oil well has operated on the shore of Kimmeridge Bay since 1959. The roughly semi-circular Kimmeridge Bay is southwest of Kimmeridge village. It is backed by low cliffs of Kimmeridge clay, and beneath the cliffs is a large wave-cut platform and a rocky shore with rock pools and attendant ecology. Kimmeridge Bay is a surfer and diver area. History In the Iron Age and during the Roman occupation, ornaments and other objects were made from the black bituminous shale—known as blackstone or 'Kimmeridge coal'—that occurs in layers within the Kimmeridge clay that covers most of Kimmeridge parish. Armlets were manufactured from the shale using a lathe, which produced waste in the form of hard black discs; these have been discovered at several sites, and were thought by 18th-century antiquaries to be coins and therefore called 'coal money'. The Romans also used the shale as fuel for boiling sea water to produce salt. In the medieval period there were three settlements within the parish: Kimmeridge, Little Kimmeridge, and Smedmore. These each had their own rectangular strip of land stretching between the coast and Smedmore Hill. Only Kimmeridge survives as a settlement of any size. In the mid 16th century Lord Mountjoy attempted to make alum here and acquired a patent to do so, though the enterprise was unsuccessful. In the first half of the 17th century Sir William Clavell made several unsuccessful efforts to turn Kimmeridge into an industrial venture. He tried boiling seawater to make salt, using the shale as fuel as the Romans had done. He then followed in Mountjoy's footsteps and founded an alum works, though he failed to secure a patent and ran foul of alum merchants in London who had sole rights (granted by Charles I) to produce alum in England; the merchants took Clavell's property and demanded £1,000 per year, then destroyed the works and stole Clavell's cattle. Clavell took legal action but was unsuccessful. He then tried to turn Kimmeridge into a port, and finally tried to manufacture glass with assistance from Sir Robert Mansell and Abraham Bigo, but both these enterprises failed;http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=887353 the pier which Clavell built for the port became ruinous and was destroyed by a storm in 1745. Clavell had Smedmore House built less than a mile south-east of Kimmeridge village; referring to it as his \\"little newe House\\", he moved into it on its completion in 1632. Previously Clavell lived at Barnston Manor, near the neighbouring village of Church Knowle. In the mid 19th century the shale was used a source of oil, and in 1847 an Act of Parliament enabled causeways, inclined planes and tramways to be built so the shale could be transported to Weymouth for processing into various petroleum-based products, including varnish, pitch, naptha, and dyes. Gas was also extracted from the shale, though like the oil it burned with a strong sulphurous smell, which limited its suitability as a domestic fuel and prevented fulfilment of a contract to supply gas to Paris for lighting. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Kimmeridge in 1868 but it was removed in 1896. In 1959 an oil well was installed above the cliffs west of Gaulter Gap, overlooking Kimmeridge Bay. Comprising a nodding donkey pump that lifts crude oil from several hundred feet below the surface, in its early years it pumped more than 100,000 gallons per week, producing a total of 200,000 tonnes between 1961 and 1974. The \\"nodding donkey\\" oil pump beside the cliff west of the village Governance In the United Kingdom national parliament, Kimmeridge is in the South Dorset parliamentary constituency which is currently represented by Richard Drax of the Conservative party. For electoral purposes there are 24 electoral wards in the constituency; Kimmeridge is in Creech Barrow ward. In local government Kimmeridge is governed by Dorset Council at the highest tier, and Kimmeridge Parish Meeting at the lowest tier. In county council elections Kimmeridge is within the Purbeck Hills Electoral Division, one of 42 divisions that each elect councillors to Dorset Council. Geography Kimmeridge village is sited beside a small stream on a roughly southwest-facing slope between the English Channel coast less than to the southwest and a curving line of hills immediately to the north and east.Ordnance Survey (1981), 1:25,000 Outdoor Leisure Map No.15 (Purbeck) Measured directly it is about west of Swanage, south of Wareham and east of Weymouth.John Bartholomew and Sons Ltd (1980), National Map Series, Sheet 4 (Dorset), Kimmeridge civil parish covers land south and east of Kimmeridge village; it is bounded by the village stream and the copses of Higher and Lower Stonehips to the northwest, Smedmore Hill and the summit of Swyre Head to the northeast, field boundaries beyond Swalland Farm to the southeast, and the coastline between Rope Lake Head and Gaulter Gap to the southwest. The neighbouring parishes are Corfe Castle to the southeast, Church Knowle to the east, and Steeple to the north; this last parish includes the western half of Kimmeridge Bay and land very close to Kimmeridge village. A panoramic view of the village from the north, looking towards the English Channel coast, which forms the horizon. The slopes of Smedmore Hill are to the left, and the Clavell Tower can just be seen on the step-shaped hill above and to the right of the village. The small parish church is on the left edge of the main cluster of buildings. Kimmeridge civil parish covers the village and the land beyond and to the left; the land in the foreground, between the camera and village, is part of neighbouring Steeple parish. Kimmeridge civil parish has several protected landscape designations covering it either in whole or part. Its coastline forms part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site that was designated in 2001 due to the global significance of its geological features and earth science interest. The coast at Kimmeridge also forms part of the South Dorset Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest. All of Kimmeridge parish is within the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which is a national designation that signifies the highest level of protection in relation to landscape scenic beauty. All the buildings in Kimmeridge village are within the Kimmeridge Conservation Area, which was created by the local planning authority in 1975 because of the historic and architectural interest of the village. Over of the coast and underwater environment at Kimmeridge Bay are designated as the Purbeck Marine Wildlife Reserve, the UK's oldest Voluntary Marine Nature Reserve; although offering no legal wildlife protection, there is a visitor centre beside Kimmeridge Bay. Kimmeridge Bay viewed from the WNW at Tyneham Cap. Kimmeridge parish occupies the further half of the bay and most of the land beyond it. Kimmeridge village is out of shot to the left. =Geology= The geology of Kimmeridge civil parish comprises bedrock formed in the Late Jurassic epoch, overlain in many places by superficial Quaternary head deposits. The bedrock is mostly Kimmeridge clay, except for the top of Smedmore Hill and along to Swyre Head, which is formed from Portland stone. Between this and the Kimmeridge clay, and outcropping just beneath the top of the hill, is a thin band of Portland sand. Landslip deposits from the Portland stone cover most of the steep southwest-facing slopes of the hills. Within the Kimmeridge clay are bands of bituminous shale and dolomite, which form flat ledges within Kimmeridge Bay that are exposed at low tide. Kimmeridge gives its name to the Kimmeridgian, the division of the Jurassic period in which the beds were laid down, because of the quality of the cliffs and the fossils they yield. Kimmeridge is also the type locality for the Jurassic age Kimmeridge Clay formation, which is well represented in southern England, and provides one of the source rocks for hydrocarbons found in the Wessex and North Sea Basins. The Kimmeridge Oil Field is northwest of Kimmeridge Bay. On the cliff west of the village is the Perenco \\"nodding donkey\\" oil pump which has been pumping continually since the late 1950s, making it the oldest working oil pump in the UK. The well currently yields around from the Middle Jurassic strata that lie around below the cliff.Natural England – England's Geology – Dorset The well has been operating for this long because it has tapped into a network of connected reserves; however the yield is decreasing year on year. The oil is transported by tanker to the Perenco site at Wytch Farm from whence it is piped to the main refinery on Southampton Water. Demography In 2013 the estimated population of Kimmeridge civil parish was 90. In the 2001 census Kimmeridge parish had 55 dwellings and a population of 110. In the 2011 census results have been published for Kimmeridge parish combined with the neighbouring parishes of Steeple and Tyneham; this combined area contained 101 dwellings and had 87 households with a population of 206. Notable buildings Kimmeridge parish church Within Kimmeridge parish there are twenty-five structures that have been listed by Historic England for their historic or architectural interest. None has been listed as Grade I, but Smedmore House is Grade II*. Along the shore immediately eastwards of Kimmeridge Bay (above Hen Cliff) is a folly known as Clavell Tower which inspired P.D. James's novel The Black Tower. It had been in danger of falling down the eroding cliff, so recently the tower was dismantled and then reassembled further back from the cliff edge. The tower is available as a holiday let. The parish church was mostly rebuilt in 1872, though it has 12th- century origins; the south door and parts of the west wall of the nave are still original. The south porch is early 13th century and the bell-cote is 15th century. The Etches Collection In 2014 £2.7 million was secured from the Heritage Lottery Fund for the purpose of creating a new museum in Kimmeridge, on the site of the old village hall. The project cost a total of £5 million and also houses conservation workshops and a new village hall and community space with a capacity for 120 people. The museum, called the Museum of Jurassic Marine Life, displays the Etches Collection of over 2,000 fossils collected over 30 years by village resident Steve Etches. The museum opened in October 2016. Surfing Kimmeridge Bay is a surfing area which breaks infrequently due to its lack of exposure to Atlantic swells, but can produce walls of water when it is 'on'. Below the cliffs to the East is 'The Ledges', with slow left- and right-hand breaking waves; the right-handers can spiral for or more into the bay. To the West is 'Broad Bench', within the Ministry of Defence firing range and only accessible when the ranges are open to the public.

Meliorism is an idea in metaphysical thinking holding that progress is a real concept leading to an improvement of the world. It holds that humans can, through their interference with processes that would otherwise be natural, produce an outcome which is an improvement over the aforementioned natural one. Meliorism, as a conception of the person and society, is at the foundation of contemporary liberal democracy and human rights and is a basic component of liberalism. Another important understanding of the meliorist tradition comes from the American Pragmatic tradition. One can read about it in the works of Lester Frank Ward, William James, and John Dewey. In James' works, however, meliorism does not pinpoint to progressivism and/or optimism. For James William James. Pragmatism, 1978. Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. p.137. [1795] meliorism stands in the middle between optimism and pessimism, and treats the salvation of the world as a probability rather than a certainty or impossibility. Meliorism has also been used by Arthur Caplan to describe positions in bioethics that are in favor of ameliorating conditions which cause suffering, even if the conditions have long existed (e.g. being in favor of cures for common diseases, being in favor of serious anti-aging therapies as they are developed). A closely related concept discussed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Marquis de Condorcet is that of perfectibility of man. Condorcet's statement, \\"Such is the object of the work I have undertaken; the result of which will be to show, from reasoning and from facts, that no bounds have been fixed to the improvement of the human faculties; that the perfectibility of man is absolutely indefinite; that the progress of this perfectibility, henceforth above the control of every power that would impede it, has no other limit than the duration of the globe upon which nature has placed us.\\"Marie-Jean-Antoine-Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condorcet, \\"Outlines of an historical view of the progress of the human mind\\" [1795] anticipates James' meliorism. Rousseau's treatment is somewhat weaker.Rousseau, J. J., (1754). \\"Discourse on the Origin of Inequality\\"(Translated by G. D. H.

During World War II, the opposition Conservative Party ran under the name National Government in the 1940 election as a means of promoting their platform of creating a wartime national government coalition (evocative of the previous war's Union government). The party was not successful in the election, which re-elected the Liberal government of William Lyon Mackenzie King, whose party continued to rule alone for the duration of World War II. =Newfoundland= The Dominion of Newfoundland (not to be part of Canada for another three decades) had a National Government during World War I led by Edward Patrick Morris.  Croatia  Croatia formed a national unity government in 1991 under prime minister Franjo Gregurić in response to the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence. Even though the cabinet included ministers from minority parties, all heads of ministries were either from the majority Croatian Democratic Union or soon defected to it.  Estonia  Estonia had national unity governments during the Estonian War of Independence (Päts I—III Provisional cabinets) and after the 1924 communist coup d'état attempt (Jaakson cabinet).  Greece  A national unity government in Greece is often called ecumenical government: * 1926 under Alexandros Zaimis * 1944 under Georgios Papandreou * 1974 under Konstantinos Karamanlis * 1989 under Xenophon Zolotas * 2011 under Lucas Papademos  Hungary  There are five periods in Hungary when national unity governments emerged: * 1917–1918, during World War I (Móric Esterházy and Sándor Wekerle cabinets) * 1919–1920, cabinet of Károly Huszár, restoration of the Kingdom of Hungary * 1944–1945, meanwhile World War II, Government of National Unity (Ferenc Szálasi cabinet) * 1944–1947, opposition government meanwhile World War II (Béla Miklós) and after following Zoltán Tildy and Ferenc Nagy cabinets) * 1956, during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 (third cabinet of Imre Nagy)  Republic of Ireland A national unity government, following the failure of government formation after the 2020 general election, has been suggested to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.  Israel  Israel has had several national unity governments, in which major rival parties formed a ruling coalition. Such a coalition was notably formed in the days leading up to the Six-Day War, and after the 1984 and 2009 elections. Another was formed amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.  Italy  In the republican era, the first two cabinets, led by Alcide De Gasperi, were supported by all three of the following parties, the pro-American Christian Democrats and the pro-Soviet Italian Communist Party and Italian Socialist Party. Afterwards, the first government generally recognised as a national unity government was the third Andreotti Cabinet, also known as non- no confidence vote government, as the Italian Communist Party decided to not take part at the confidence vote. The communists voted in favour of the motion of confidence for the following cabinet, still led by Giulio Andreotti. During the Eurozone crisis, the two main parties, The People of Freedom and the Democratic Party, along with other minor political forces, supported the Monti cabinet, and eventually, after the 2013 general election, formed a grand coalition in support of the Letta Cabinet, which, however, was opposed by a new major political force in parliament, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement. Here is a list of national unity or grand coalition governments: *De Gasperi II Cabinet (14 July 1946 – 2 February 1947) *De Gasperi III Cabinet (2 February 1947 – 1 June 1947) *Andreotti III Cabinet (29 July 1976 – 11 March 1978) *Andreotti IV Cabinet (11 March 1978 – 20 March 1979) *Ciampi Cabinet (28 April 1993 – 10 May 1994) – Note: grand coalition support lasted only until 4 May 1993 *Monti Cabinet (16 November 2011 – 28 April 2013) *Letta Cabinet (28 April 2013 – 22 February 2014) – Note: grand coalition support lasted only until 15 November 2013 Kenya From 2008 to 2013, Kenya was governed by Government of National Unity between the rival Party of National Unity of Mwai Kibaki and the Orange Democratic Movement of Raila Odinga following the 2007 presidential election and subsequent violence. This was due to the ODM winning the majority of seats in the National Assembly, but controversially losing the presidential election by a margin that has since been called into question for its validity. Lebanon Since Lebanon is a multireligious state and consensus democracy, having a national unity government is more favorable in this country. Unlike other democracies, no group in Lebanon can govern alone.  Luxembourg  Luxembourg has had two National Union Governments. The first was formed in 1916, during World War I (in which Luxembourg was neutral, but occupied by Germany nonetheless). It was led by Victor Thorn and included all of the major factions in the Chamber of Deputies, but lasted for only sixteen months. The second National Union Government was formed in November 1945, in the aftermath of World War II, which had devastated Luxembourg. It was led by Pierre Dupong, who had been Prime Minister in the government in exile in the war, and included all four parties represented in the Chamber of Deputies. The government lasted until 1947, by which time, a normal coalition between two of the three largest parties had been arranged, thus maintaining the confidence of the legislature. In addition, Luxembourg had a Liberation Government between November 1944 and November 1945, also under Dupong. It served a similar emergency role to a national government, but included only the two largest parties, the CSV and the LSAP.  Namibia   Nepal  Following the devastating April 2015 Nepal earthquake, top political parties in Nepal have decided to form a national unity government in order to handle the crisis and draft a constitution that's been long overdue. The major political parties and unified political fronts have agreed to settle the disputed issues of the constitution drafting process by 3 June and to form a national unity government.http://setopati.net/politics/6831/  Palestine  The Palestinian Unity Government of June 2014 was a national unity government of the Palestinian National Authority under Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas formed on 2 June 2014 following the Fatah-Hamas Reconciliation Agreement that had been signed on 23 April 2014. The ministers were nominally independent, but overwhelmingly seen as loyal to President Abbas and his Fatah movement or to smaller leftist factions, none of whom were believed to have close ties to Hamas.[1] However, the Unity Government was not approved by the Legislative Council, leading to its legitimacy being questioned.[2][3] The Unity Government dissolved on 17 June 2015 after President Abbas said it was unable to operate in the Gaza Strip. South Africa The interim constitution negotiated by the multi-party negotiations that started in 1990 allowed all parties that gained more than 10% of the vote to participate in a Government of National Unity. The new government that was elected in 1994 therefore had members from many political parties in the cabinet. This government of national unity lasted until the general election in 1999, although a reported lack of shared decision-making prompted the second-largest party to withdraw from the GNU in 1996.  South Sudan  Sri Lanka Following the fall of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, the United National Party who won the 2015 elections formed a National Unity Government with the main opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party Under Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickramasinghe.  Sudan  Sweden Sweden has only had one national unity government; The Hansson III Cabinet during World War II. The government was made up of all parties in the parliament except the Communist party which was considered to be pro-Soviet and hence unreliable (the Communist party lost their parliamentary representation in 1940 election). The government consisted of six ministers from the Social Democratic party (including prime minister Per Albin Hansson), three from the Right Wing party, three from the Liberal People's party, three from the Farmer's League and two nonpartisan politicians. The ultimate goal of this government's policy was to keep Sweden out of the war, which they also succeeded with. The Hansson government introduced censorship of press, literature and culture, which was applied to both pro-nazi and pro-communist propaganda. The government also approved departures from the neutrality policy to keep Sweden out of the war.  United Kingdom  First-past-the-post voting, the British electoral system, has long increased the likelihood of a single party gaining a majority of members of Parliament, who have run most departments and the government legislation of the country since the early 20th century. After the formation of clear political parties in the Lords and Commons, the first national unity government in the country was the Ministry of All the Talents that led the United Kingdom for about a year after the death of William Pitt the Younger in 1806, during the Napoleonic Wars. This ministry had cross-party support, ranging from very socially conservative Tories, and the broad range of Whigs (among them Charles James Fox and his 'Foxites'), selected for their combined broad political support in both Houses of Parliament and known capabilities in a time of crisis. However, the ministry was frustrated in its attempts to make peace with France, and despite one major legislative success (banning the slave trade in Britain), it fell apart in 1807 over the question of Catholic Emancipation and was replaced following a general election by a Tory ministry led by the Duke of Portland. It proved that major wars and the long recovery to Great Depression would be the only further instances of National Governments. The Asquith coalition ministry presented a brief national coalition (1915–1916) during World War I. =Quasi-national governments= Thereafter a coalition that faced few opposition MPs under David Lloyd George lasted until 1922 when his National Liberal Party formally split with the Liberal Party. During the Great Depression the first of four consecutive National Governments was formed in 1931 by Ramsay MacDonald (Labour/National Labour) succeeded by Stanley Baldwin (Conservative) with their largest opponent and the Liberals. Most members of the Labour and Liberal Parties rejected the government, however, and moved to the opposition benches leaving MacDonald's supporters to rival mainstream party candidates in many cases as National Labour/National Labour Organisation or in Lloyd George's revived National Liberal Party. Notably candidates styled in this way contested the 1935 election; this long period of quasi-national government took in broader support and widened its selections of ministers in the war years, and its fourth transmutation persisted until the general election of 1945. In 2019, the idea of a government of National Unity was proposed by politicians including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson to stop a no-deal Brexit spearheaded by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.  United States  In hopes of bridging partisan politics during the American Civil War, Republican Abraham Lincoln ran his second term as a National Union government with Democrat Andrew Johnson as his vice president. The new National Union Party allowed members to retain affiliations with other political parties. Since the Civil War, there has never been a \\"national unity\\" government in the United States in the traditional sense. There have been several instances, however, during national disasters or wars, that the two parties have briefly \\"rallied around the President.\\" Such instances include the attack on Pearl Harbor, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and the September 11 attacks, all of which not only had a worldwide effect, but preceded a massive spike in the approval rating of the sitting president.  Zimbabwe  The 2008–2009 Zimbabwean political negotiations between the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (led by Morgan Tsvangirai), its small splinter group, the Movement for Democratic Change – Mutambara (led by Arthur Mutambara), and the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (led by Robert Mugabe) created a framework for a power-sharing executive government between the two parties. These negotiations followed the 2008 presidential election, in which Mugabe was controversially re-elected, as well as the 2008 parliamentary election, in which the MDC won a majority in the House of Assembly. The new national unity government, including Tsvangirai, was sworn in on 11 February 2009.

Situation puzzles are usually played in a group, with one person hosting the puzzle and the others asking questions which can only be answered with a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" answer. Depending upon the settings and level of difficulty, other answers, hints or simple explanations of why the answer is yes or no, may be considered acceptable. The puzzle is solved when one of the players is able to recite the narrative the host had in mind, in particular explaining whatever aspect of the initial scenario was puzzling. These puzzles are inexact and many puzzle statements have more than one possible fitting answer. The goal however is to find out the story as the host has it in mind. Critical thinking and reading, logical thinking, as well as lateral thinking may all be required to solve a situation puzzle. The term lateral thinking was coined by Edward De Bono to denote a creative problem- solving style that involves looking at the given situation from unexpected angles, and is typically necessary to the solution of situation puzzles. The term \\"lateral-thinking puzzle\\" was popularised by Paul Sloane in his 1992 book Lateral Thinking Puzzlers.Jed Hartman, Rec.puzzles archive 27 Aug 1998 http://www.kith.org/logos/things/sitpuz/lateral.html Example One situation puzzle would be: The question-and-answer segment might go something like this. #Question: Could the bartender hear him? Answer: Yes #Question: Was the bartender angry for some reason? A: No #Question: Was the gun a water pistol? A: No #Question: Did they know each other from before? A: No (or: \\"irrelevant\\" since either way it does not affect the outcome) #Question: Was the man's \\"thank you\\" sarcastic? A: No (or with a small hint: \\"No, he was genuinely grateful\\") #Question: Did the man ask for water in an offensive way? A: No #Question: Did the man ask for water in some strange way? A: Yes Eventually the questions lead up to the conclusion that the man had the hiccups, and that his reason for requesting a drink of water was not to quench his thirst but to cure his hiccups. The bartender realized this and chose instead to cure the hiccups by frightening the man with the gun. Once the man realized that his hiccups were gone, he no longer needed a drink of water, gratefully thanked the bartender, and left.  Terminology  * Yope is a word devised to answer a question with yes and no simultaneously, in a sense saying Yes, but ... and No, but ... at the same time. This would be used when it would be misleading to give a simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" answer to the player's question. It can be compared to the Japanese and Korean term mu, which is often translated as meaning that the question must be \\"unasked\\", as it cannot be answered. * N/a (or stating \\"irrelevant\\") is used when a question is not applicable to the current situation or when a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" answer would not provide any usable information to solving the puzzle. * Irrelevant, but assume yes is used when the situation is the same regardless of what the correct answer to the question is, but assuming one direction will make further questioning easier or the situation more likely. An example question that might have this answer from the puzzle above is: “Was the gun loaded?”  See also  *Twenty Questions Further reading * Edward De Bono, Lateral Thinking : Creativity Step by Step, Harper & Row, 1973, trade paperback, 300 pages, References Category:Puzzles ","title":"Situation puzzle"},{"id":"271821","title":"Dervla Murphy"},{"id":"271841","text":"Peter Frankenfeld (1975) Peter Frankenfeld (born Willi Julius August Frankenfeldt on 31 May 1913 in Berlin – 4 January 1979 in Hamburg) was a German comedian, radio and television personality. After World War II he became an interpreter with the U.S. military government. In 1948 he went into broadcasting. He pioneered quiz programs on West German radio and television, becoming the country's best-known programme host and entertainer. He is remembered for some classic sketches such as \\"Der Überzieher\\" (about a man getting in trouble in a restaurant because he has to constantly guard his overcoat), \\"Die Bürgschaft\\" (his bumbling attempt to recite Schiller's poem The Hostage), or \\"Die Wetterkarte\\" (The Weather Chart, where he speaks in a wide variety of German dialects). In 1962, he and director Heinz Dunkhase discovered the comedy sketch Dinner for One in Blackpool which was staged in Frankenfeld's live show shortly thereafter, and recorded on 8 July 1963. The show was re-run occasionally on German television until it got its fixed spot on New Year's Eve in 1972. He was married to the singer Lonny Kellner.

He was voted the 18th greatest stand-up comic of all time on Channel 4's 100 Greatest Stand-ups in 2007. In an updated 2010 poll he came 72nd. Much of Sayle's humour is in the tradition of Spike Milligan and Monty Python, with riffs based on often absurd and surreal premises. His act is noted for its cynicism and political awareness, as well as physical comedy. Early life Sayle was born and brought up in the Anfield suburb of Liverpool, Lancashire, the son of Molly (Malka) Sayle (née Mendelson), a pools clerk, and Joseph Henry Sayle, a railway guard, both of whom were members of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Sayle's mother was of Lithuanian Jewish descent, and some members of his family were devout Jews. From 1964 to 1969 he attended Alsop High School in Walton, and was expelled halfway through sixth form. After that, Sayle took a foundation course in art at Southport, before attending Chelsea College of Art and Design in London. He attended Garnett College, Roehampton, a training college for teachers in further education. Career =Stand-up comedy and theatre= When the Comedy Store opened in London in 1979, Sayle responded to an advert in Private Eye for would-be comedians and became its first master of ceremonies. In 1980, comedy producer Martin Lewis saw Sayle perform at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and became his manager. Sayle became the leading performer at the Comic Strip. He appeared on The Comic Strip Album (1981) and recorded Cak! (1982). He also appeared in the stage show, film and comedy album of The Secret Policeman's Other Ball (1981–1982). Sayle's material covered a broad range of topics, but one of his favourite subjects remained politics. His angry persona, coupled with his vociferous delivery, gave immense bite to his material. A typical example of Sayle's humour was his attack on American phrases: \\"If you travel to the States ... they have a lot of different words than like what we use. For instance: they say 'elevator', we say 'lift'; they say 'drapes', we say 'curtains'; they say 'president', we say 'seriously deranged git!'\\" In 1988, Sayle played the role of Trinculo in Shakespeare's The Tempest, directed by Jonathan Miller at the Old Vic theatre in London. Sixteen years on from his last stand-up comedy tour, Sayle returned in 2011 as an MC, compering the middle section of At Last! The 1981 Show, curated by Stewart Lee at the Royal Festival Hall. Although this was mainly a nostalgia night with comedians such as Nigel Planer and Norman Lovett revisiting their material from the 1980s, Sayle premiered some new material that was more anecdotal than his previous work. Sayle says of his old style: \\"What I was doing, which I hadn’t realised, was a comic persona. The guy in the tight suit was actually a creation. I thought it was me in a sense but it wasn’t.\\" Alongside artists such as Isy Suttie and Jim Bob, Sayle appeared at the fourth \\"Nine Lessons and Carols for Godless People\\" event at the Bloomsbury Theatre in December 2011. In January and February 2012, he compered four nights of stand-up comedy at the Soho Theatre. He completed a full UK stand-up tour in October and November 2012, and a sixteen-night residency at the Soho Theatre in January and February 2013, where he performed new material. He played a further ten nights at the Soho Theatre in April 2013. He also performed at the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. He has toured extensively in recent years. =Radio= Sayle's early work included several performances for Capital London. In 1979 he wrote and performed the radio series, Alexei Sayle and the Fish People, for which he won a Pye Radio Award (later known as the Sony Radio Awards). Sayle later released an album based on the show, The Fish People Tapes. This was followed by Alexei Sayle and the Dutch Lieutenant's Trousers in 1980, the name being a reference to John Fowles' book. He has since contributed to many other radio shows, including writing the five-part sitcom series, Sorry About Last Night (1999), in which he also played the leading role. On 3 November 2006 he presented Chopwell Soviet, a 30-minute programme on BBC Radio 4 that reviewed the Chopwell miners 80 years after the village of Chopwell became known as Little Moscow. Sayle returned to Radio 4 in 2016 with Alexei Sayle's Imaginary Sandwich Bar. In 2019, he narrated the dramatisation of four of his short stories in the series Alexei Sayle's The Absence of Normal, again on Radio 4. =Television= Sayle's first high-profile television appearances were on Central Independent Television's late-night alternative cabaret show O.T.T. (1982). He left nine weeks into the show's run to tour Australia with the Comic Strip. He played various roles in the situation comedy The Young Ones (1982–1984), along with Adrian Edmondson, Rik Mayall, Nigel Planer and Christopher Ryan. In the programme Sayle portrayed several members of an Eastern European family; the Balowskis. In 1985, he appeared in the Doctor Who serial Revelation of the Daleks. In a column for a British tabloid newspaper around the same time, he indicated that he wanted to become the \\"first Socialist Doctor.\\" He also appeared in several episodes of The Comic Strip Presents... between 1985 and 1993, most notably playing the two leading roles in \\"Didn't You Kill My Brother?\\" which he co-wrote with David Stafford and Pauline Melville. Sayle has co-written and starred in many other programmes, including three series of Alexei Sayle's Stuff (1988–1991), two series of The All New Alexei Sayle Show (1994–1995) and one series of Alexei Sayle's Merry-Go-Round (1998). In 1989, Sayle was awarded an International Emmy for Stuff. In conversation with Mark Thomas on BBC Radio 4's informal chat-show Chain Reaction, Sayle revealed that the first he knew of the award was when he watched Channel 4 News and saw, to his amazement, Benny Hill collecting the award on his behalf. In 1990, Sayle had a fatwa proclaimed against him by a Muslim cleric from Syria after a joke on his BBC comedy show Stuff. This fatwa has never been withdrawn. Sayle was signed in 1992 to a seven-year contract to play an Eastern European chef as a regular character on the American sitcom The Golden Palace, the sequel to The Golden Girls, but was fired and replaced by Cheech Marin before the pilot was shot. The series was cancelled after one season. In 1994 he presented the miniseries Drive, which gave advice for safe driving through Sayle's signature form of humour interspersed with serious pieces. In 2008, he wrote and presented Alexei Sayle's Liverpool, a three-part television series in which he reconnected with his home town. He stated in the programmes that on first hearing that Liverpool was to be awarded the European Capital of Culture, he received much criticism for describing the city as \\"philistine\\". He now feels that he does not know whether or not his original statement was true, but as a result of making the series he does now consider Liverpool to be his home, and he has vowed to go back there more often in the future. Sayle also narrated the PIF Moon Lighters about two moon creatures, Biblock and Hoblock and the dangers of lighters. Sayle replaced Rolf Harris as the narrator for the Nick Junior and Milkshake! series Olive The Ostrich. Episodes featuring Sayle's narration commenced broadcasting on 22 July 2013. =Film= Sayle alternates his comedy work with performances as a character actor ranging from serious (Gorky Park, 1983) to humorous (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, 1989). He appeared in the 1992 Carry On film, Carry On Columbus along with various modern comedians including Comic Strip founder Peter Richardson, as well as members of the original Carry On team. =Music= Sayle has released five comedy singles with full musical backing and one live recording from the Comedy Store in London 1981. This was a double A side with Alex Arundel the London based Scottish songwriter and founding member of Alternative Cabaret with the song \\"When The Gold Runs Dry\\", being the other A side. His most successful single was \\"'Ullo John! Gotta New Motor?\\" which achieved Top 20 chart success in the UK upon re-release in 1984. Produced by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley (who also produced for Madness and Elvis Costello), the record in its 12-inch version achieved notoriety owing to its extensive use of profane language. The two follow up singles, \\"Didn't You Kill My Brother?\\", and \\"Meanwhile\\", were taken from the album Panic, the cover of which parodies the cover of the Michael Jackson album Off the Wall. =Writing= Sayle has written two short story collections, five novels, including a graphic novel and a radio series spin-off book, as well as columns for various publications. His book Great Bus Journeys of the World, co-written with David Stafford, is mostly a collection of his columns for Time Out and the Sunday Mirror. He was one of eight contributory authors to the BBC Three competition End of Story, in which members of the public completed the second half of stories written by established authors. The winning entry to Sayle's story, Imitating Katherine Walker, was written by freelance writer Arthur Allan. Sayle's autobiography Stalin Ate My Homework, which deals with his early life and which he describes as a 'satirical memoir', was published in 2010. In 2012 he joined The Daily Telegraph as a motoring columnist. In early 2015 he toured giving readings from the second volume of his autobiography Thatcher Stole My Trousers, published in 2016. Personal life In 1974, Sayle married Linda Rawsthorn. He lives in Bloomsbury in central London and is a keen cyclist. He also owns a house near Granada, in southern Spain. Political views Around the age of 15, Sayle decided to join the Young Communist League, but only went to a few meetings. ‘The Soviet Union was going soft and…China with the Cultural Revolution was really the way to go...’. In 1968, he joined a Maoist organisation. In 2009, he said that, while no longer active in left politics, \\"I still would adhere to those philosophical and economic ideas of Marxism that I got when I was sixteen. ... it's seemed to me as true now as it did then\\". Sayle is a critic of fox hunting and was among more than 20 high- profile people who signed a letter to Members of Parliament in 2015 to oppose Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron's plan to amend the Hunting Act 2004. In February 2016, Sayle said of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn: \\"He's ascetic and morally incorruptible. The propaganda that's thrown against him is disgraceful. Until he appeared, you had to vote for one kind of Oxbridge twat or another, people who all go to the same dinner parties, people like the Ed Ballses and George Osbornes. Jeremy has shown that, within a democratic tradition, other things are possible.\\" In 2016, he wrote a comment piece for The Guardian saying that he was happy to mock New Labour in his act but now that Corbyn was about to \\"reform the party in his own image – ascetic, socialist, kindly and ethical\\" he would stop making jokes about Labour. In May 2018, regarding the expulsion of Marc Wadsworth from the Labour Party, Sayle commented: \\"The Party should walk over broken glass to beg people of Marc's calibre to work with them - they are very few and Marc is one of the best. There is a battle going on to destroy and reverse the unexpected and amazing gains the left has made in the last three years. Marc is a casualty in that battle and I am joining the fight to see him re-instated to the front line.\\" In November 2019, along with other public figures, Sayle signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as \\"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world\\" and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election. In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that \\"Labour's election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.\\" In January 2020, he was condemned by some Jewish groups after being one of thousands to sign an open letter criticising Rebecca Long-Bailey and other Labour leadership candidates for saying they would sign a ten point pledge by the Board of Deputies of British Jews intended to combat anti-semitism should they be elected. Opponents have stated that the pledges are political interference by an organisation overtly hostile to today’s Labour Party and everything it stands for. The letter was organised by Momentum activist, Jackie Walker and former Labour MP Chris Williamson, both of whom were expelled from Labour in relation to charges of anti- semitism.

Situated in the south-central Berlin borough of Tempelhof-Schöneberg, the airport ceased operating in 2008 amid controversy, leaving Tegel and Schönefeld as the two main airports serving the city, with the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport still under construction as of 2020. Tempelhof was designated as an airport by the Reich Ministry of Transport on 8 October 1923. The old terminal was originally constructed in 1927. In anticipation of increasing air traffic, the Nazi government began a massive reconstruction in the mid-1930s. While it was occasionally cited as the world's oldest operating commercial airport, the title was disputed by several other airports, and is no longer an issue since its closure. Tempelhof was one of Europe's three iconic pre-World War II airports, the others being London's now defunct Croydon Airport and the old Paris–Le Bourget Airport. It acquired a further iconic status as the centre of the Berlin Airlift of 1948–49. One of the airport's most distinctive features is its massive, canopy-style roof extending over the apron, able to accommodate most contemporary airliners in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, protecting passengers from the elements. Tempelhof Airport's main building was once among the twenty largest buildings on earth, but it also formerly contained the world's smallest duty-free shop.Airports International June 1975 (industry magazine) Tempelhof Airport closed all operations on 30 October 2008, despite the efforts of some protesters to prevent the closure. A non-binding referendum was held on 27 April 2008 against the impending closure but failed due to low voter turnout. The former airfield has subsequently been used as a recreational space known as Tempelhofer Feld. In September 2015 it was announced that Tempelhof would also become an emergency refugee camp. Function Tempelhof was often called the \\"City Airport\\". In its later years, it mostly had commuter flights to other parts of Germany and neighbouring countries; but it had in the past received long-haul, wide-bodied airliners, such as the Boeing 747, the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar and the Lockheed C-5A Galaxy. The first of these three first appeared at Tempelhof on 18 September 1976, when Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) flew in Boeing 747SP Clipper Great Republic to participate in the static exhibition of contemporary military, non-combat and civil aircraft at the annual \\"Day of Open House\\" of the United States Air Force (USAF) at the airport. The Galaxy had its first appearance at Tempelhof on 17 September 1971, when an aircraft of the USAF's 436th Military Airlift Wing flew in from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, United States, to participate in that year's \\"Day of Open House\\" static exhibition. These events respectively marked the debut at Tempelhof of the largest aircraft in commercial airline service at the time and the then-largest aircraft overall. It had two parallel runways. Runway 09L/27R was 2,094 metres (6,870 ft) long and runway 09R/27L was 1,840 m (6,037 ft). Both were paved with asphalt. The taxiway was in the shape of an oval around these two runways, with a single terminal on the northwest side of the airport. Other possible uses for Tempelhof have been discussed, and many people are trying to keep the airport buildings preserved. In September 2015, in the midst of the 2015 European migrant crisis, it was announced by the Berlin state government that Tempelhof would become an 'emergency refugee shelter', holding at least 1,200 people in two former hangars. History Adolf Hitler at Zentralflughafen Tempelhof-Berlin, 1932 The site of the airport was originally Knights Templar land in medieval Berlin, and from this beginning came the name Tempelhof. Later, the site was used as a parade field by Prussian forces, and by unified German forces from 1720 to the start of World War I. In 1909, Frenchman Armand Zipfel made the first flight demonstration in Tempelhof, followed by Orville Wright later that same year. Tempelhof was first officially designated as an airport on 8 October 1923. Deutsche Luft Hansa was founded in Tempelhof on 6 January 1926. The old terminal, originally constructed in 1927, became the world's first with an underground railway. The station has since been renamed Paradestraße, because the rebuilding of the airport in the 1930s required the airport access to be moved to a major intersection with a station now called Platz der Luftbrücke after the Berlin Airlift. As part of Albert Speer's plan for the reconstruction of Berlin during the Nazi era, Prof. Ernst Sagebiel was ordered to replace the old terminal with a new terminal building in 1934. The airport halls and the adjoining buildings, intended to become the gateway to Europe and a symbol of Hitler's \\"world capital\\" Germania, are still known as one of the largest built entities worldwide, and have been described by British architect Sir Norman Foster as \\"the mother of all airports\\". With its façades of shell limestone, the terminal building, built between 1936 and 1941, forms a quadrant. Arriving passengers walked through customs controls to the reception hall. Tempelhof was served by the U6 U-Bahn line along Mehringdamm and up Friedrichstraße (Platz der Luftbrücke station). Zentralflughafen Tempelhof-Berlin had the advantage of a central location just minutes from the Berlin city centre and quickly became one of the world's busiest airports. Tempelhof saw its greatest pre-war days during 1938–1939, when up to 52 foreign and 40 domestic flights arrived and departed daily from the old terminal while the new one was still under construction. The new air terminal was designed as headquarters for Deutsche Luft Hansa (moved in 1938), the German national airline at that time. As a forerunner of today's modern airports, the building was designed with many unique features, including giant arc-shaped aircraft hangars. Although under construction for more than ten years, it was never finished because of World War II. For passengers and freight, the 1927-built terminal stayed in use until 24 April 1945. The building complex was designed to resemble an eagle in flight with semicircular hangars forming the bird's spread wings. A hangar roof was to have been laid in tiers to form a stadium for spectators at air and ground demonstrations. Norman Foster called Tempelhof \\"one of the really great buildings of the modern age\\". =World War II= The airport in 1937, at the 1927-built terminal building. Fearing Allied bombing of airports, all German civil aviation was halted on 2 September 1939, but gradually restarted from 1 November.Laurenz Demps and Carl-Ludwig Paeschke, Flughafen Tempelhof: Die Geschichte einer Legende, Berlin: Ullstein, 1998, p. 68. . However, the 1927-built terminal remained closed to all civil aviation, and all Berlin- bound/-originating civilian aircraft movements transferred to an airfield in Rangsdorf until 7 March 1940, when the 1927 terminal was reopened and civil aviation continued until 24 April 1945. From January 1940 until early 1944, Weser Flugzeugbau assembled Junkers Ju 87 \\"Stuka\\" dive bombers; thereafter, it assembled Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter planes in the still unfurnished main hall and hangars 3 to 7 of the new terminal, which were supplied by a railway and trucks via a connecting tunnel.Laurenz Demps and Carl-Ludwig Paeschke, Flughafen Tempelhof: Die Geschichte einer Legende, Berlin: Ullstein, 1998, pp. 69seqq. . Hangars 1 and 2 were not used to assemble aircraft as these were already used by Luft Hansa for its own planes. Aircraft parts were brought in from all over the city while complete aircraft engines were trucked to Tempelhof. Once the airframes were complete and the engines had been installed, the finished aircraft were flown out. The Luftwaffe did not use Tempelhof as a military airfield during World War II, except for occasional emergency landings by fighter aircraft. On 21 April 1945, Deutsche Luft Hansa operated its last scheduled flights, and over the coming days laid on additional non-scheduled flights from Johannisthal Air Field which stopped over at Tempelhof to take on freight en route to Travemünde and Munich, where Luft Hansa had relocated its headquarters.Laurenz Demps and Carl-Ludwig Paeschke, Flughafen Tempelhof: Die Geschichte einer Legende, Berlin: Ullstein, 1998, pp. 78seq. . Two days later, on 23 April, the airline's last-ever flight to depart Tempelhof left for Madrid, but was later shot down over Southern Germany.Laurenz Demps and Carl-Ludwig Paeschke, Flughafen Tempelhof: Die Geschichte einer Legende, Berlin: Ullstein, 1998, p. 79. . Tempelhof's German commander, Oberst Rudolf Böttger, refused to carry out orders to blow up the base, choosing instead to kill himself. Soviet forces took Tempelhof in the Battle of Berlin on 28 and 29 April 1945 in the closing days of the war in Europe. Soviet forces combed through the old and the new terminal searching for treasures, hidden places and documents, opening all rooms. During their search, they blew up the fortified entrance to a three-level bomb shelter for celluloid films of the Hansa Luftbild GmbH, a Luft Hansa subsidiary specialising in aerial photography. The explosion immediately ignited the celluloid, turning the film shelter under the northern office wing of the new terminal into a furnace and making it impossible to enter for several weeks. The raging inferno led the Soviet commander to order the lower levels to be flooded with water. With no functioning water supply in war-torn Berlin, this was only possible because the new terminal, which had suffered only slight war damage, had its own electricity and groundwater utility with underground reservoirs under the northerly forecourt of the new terminal close to the film shelter. On 8 May 1945, Western Allied and German signatories of the German Surrender in Berlin and their entourage landed at Tempelhof airport.Laurenz Demps and Carl-Ludwig Paeschke, Flughafen Tempelhof: Die Geschichte einer Legende, Berlin: Ullstein, 1998, p. 80. . At the beginning of May, Weser Flugzeugbau opened a workshop in hangar 7 to repair streetcars. In the following weeks, Berliners raided all unguarded parts of the opened buildings searching for food or anything else useful in bartering in the black market. In accordance with the Yalta agreements, Zentralflughafen Berlin-Tempelhof was turned over to the United States Army 2nd Armored Division on 2 July 1945 by the Soviet Union as part of the American occupation sector of Berlin. This agreement was later formalised by the August 1945 Potsdam Agreement, which formally divided Berlin into four occupation sectors. The 852nd Engineer Aviation Battalion arrived at Tempelhof (Code Number R-95) on 10 July 1945 and conducted the original repairs in the new terminal. After the Allied Control Council had agreed upon West Berlin Air Corridors under control of the Berlin Air Safety Center, these opened in February 1946, enabling civil aviation at Tempelhof to restart.Laurenz Demps and Carl-Ludwig Paeschke, Flughafen Tempelhof: Die Geschichte einer Legende, Berlin: Ullstein, 1998, p. 83. . =Berlin Airlift= Douglas C-47 transport planes preparing to take off from Tempelhof during the Berlin Airlift, August 1948. On 20 June 1948, Soviet authorities, claiming technical difficulties, halted all traffic by land and by water into or out of the western-controlled sectors of Berlin. The only remaining access routes into the city were three -wide air corridors across the Soviet Zone of Occupation. Faced with the choice of abandoning the city or attempting to supply its inhabitants with the necessities of life by air, the Western Powers chose the latter course. 1949 stamp from West Berlin with a Douglas C-54 Skymaster over Tempelhof airport Berlin Airlift Memorial on Platz der Luftbrücke in front of the airport, displaying the names of the 39 British and 31 American pilots who lost their lives during the operation, and symbolising the three air corridors. Operation Vittles, as the airlift was unofficially named, began on 26 June when USAF Douglas C-47 Skytrains carried 80 tons of food into Tempelhof, far less than the estimated 4,500 tons of food, coal and other essential supplies needed daily to maintain a minimum level of existence. But this force was soon augmented by United States Navy and Royal Air Force cargo aircraft, as well as British European Airways (BEA) and many of Britain's fledgling wholly privately owned, independent airlines. The latter included Sir Freddie Laker's Air Charter, Eagle Aviation and Skyways. On 15 October 1948, to promote increased safety and cooperation between the separate US and British airlift efforts, the Allies created a unified command – the Combined Airlift Task Force under Maj. Gen. William H. Tunner, USAF – at Tempelhof. To facilitate the command and control, as well as the unloading of aircraft, the USAF 53d Troop Carrier Squadron was temporarily assigned to Tempelhof. The grass runways usual in Germany until then could not cope with the massive demand, and a subsequently built runway containing perforated steel mattingalso known as Pierced Steel Matting (PSP) began to crumble under the weight of the USAF's C-54 Skymasters.Laurenz Demps and Carl- Ludwig Paeschke, Flughafen Tempelhof: Die Geschichte einer Legende, Berlin: Ullstein, 1998, p. 88. . Hence, American engineers built a new runway at Tempelhof between July and September 1948 and another between September and October 1948 to accommodate the expanding requirements of the airlift. The old airport terminal of 1927 was demolished in 1948 in order to create additional space for unloading more planes. The last airlift transport touched down at Tempelhof on 30 September 1949. Tempelhof also became famous as the location of Operation Little Vittles: the dropping of candy to children living near the airport. The original Candy Bomber, Gail Halvorsen noticed children lingering near the fence line of the airport and wanted to share something with them. He eventually started dropping candy by parachute just before landing. His efforts were expanded by other pilots and eventually became a part of legend in the city of Berlin. =Cold War= As the Cold War intensified in the late 1950s and 1960s, access problems to West Berlin, both by land and air, continued to cause tension. Throughout the Cold War years, Tempelhof was the main terminal for American military transport aircraft accessing West Berlin. In 1969 one of the pilots during the Berlin Airlift, and the original Candy Bomber, Gail Halvorsen, returned to Berlin as the commander of Tempelhof airbase. With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany, the presence of American forces in Berlin ended. The USAF 7350th Air Base Group at Tempelhof was inactivated in June 1993. In July 1994, with President Clinton in attendance, the British, French, and American air and land forces in Berlin were deactivated in a ceremony on the Four Ring Parade field at McNair Barracks. The Western Allies returned a united city of Berlin to the unified German government. The U.S. Army closed its Berlin Army Aviation Detachment at TCA in August 1994, ending a 49-year American military presence in Berlin. = U.S. Army Aviation = In 1951 the US Army stationed an aviation element of the 6. Infantry Brigade-(6th Infantry Regiment?) with three Hiller OH-23A Raven helicopters at Tempelhof. Over the years it became known as the Berlin Brigade Aviation Detachment (BBDE Avn.Det.). The Hiller OH-23A was soon replaced by Bell OH-13 Sioux. Further helicopters stationed over the years where Sikorsky H-19 Chikasaw (1958–1964), Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw (1962–1964), Bell UH-1B (1964–1971)and finally Bell UH-1H (May 1971– August 1994).http://www.theberlinobserver.com/archive/1971V27/V27_N19_may14.pdfPage 3 Fixed wing aircraft stationed at Tempelhof were Cessna O-1 Bird Dog (1965–1975), De Havilland Canada U-6 Beaver (1968 – January 1980),url=http://www.theberlinobserver.com/archive/1980V36/V36_N7_feb15.pdf title=Page 5 Last two U-6s retired berlin Observer 15 February 1980 publisher=http://www.theberlinobserver.com accessdate=10 June 2019}} Cessna O-2A (1975–1979), Pilatus UV-20A Chiricahua (1979–1991), Beechcraft U-8D Seminole(1960s), Beechcraft U-21 (1970s–1986 and 1991–1994), as well as Beechcraft C-12C (1986–1991). =Postwar commercial use= DC 4 of Pan American World Airways in January 1954 Pan Am Douglas DC-4 seen parked in front of a hangar at Berlin Tempelhof in January 1954.

American Overseas Airlines (AOA), at the time the overseas division of American Airlines, inaugurated the first commercial air link serving Tempelhof after the war with a flight from New York via Shannon, Amsterdam and Frankfurt on 18 May 1946.Berlin Airport Company – Airline Portrait – Pan Am, January 1975 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1975Aircraft Illustrated (Airport Profile – Berlin-Tempelhof), Vol 42, No 1, p. 32, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, January 2009 This was followed by AOA's inauguration of West Berlin's first dedicated domestic air link between Tempelhof and Frankfurt's Rhein-Main Airport on 1 March 1948.Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, pp. 4, 8, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 AOA was the only commercial operator at Tempelhof to maintain its full flying programme for the entire duration of the Berlin Blockade (26 June 1948 – 12 May 1949). Following the end of the Berlin Blockade, AOA launched additional dedicated scheduled services linking Tempelhof with Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel and Düsseldorf Lohausen from 6 March and 1 June 1950 respectively.Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, p. 4, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 On 25 September 1950, Pan Am acquired AOA from American Airlines. This merger resulted in Pan Am establishing a growing presence at Tempelhof.Aviation News – Pan American World Airways: Part 2, Vol. 73, No. 11, p. 48, Key Publishing, Stamford, November 2011 (In addition to continuing AOA's original, multistop Berlin – New York route and dedicated internal German services connecting Berlin with Frankfurt, Hamburg and Düsseldorf, between 1955 and 1959, Pan Am commenced regular, year-round scheduled services to Cologne, Stuttgart, Hanover, Munich and Nuremberg from Tempelhof.) Pan Am's initial equipment for its new Berlin operation were unpressurised, 60-seat Douglas DC-4s, widely available at the time due to the large number of war-surplus C-54 Skymasters. 1950 was also the year Air France joined Pan Am at Tempelhof.Berlin Airport Company – Airline Portrait – Air France, March 1975 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1975 Air France resumed operations to Tempelhof following their cessation during the war years. This was furthermore the time Allied restrictions on the carriage of local civilians on commercial airline services from/to West Berlin were lifted. It entailed transferring responsibility for processing all commercial flights to West Berlin's city government, including the operation and maintenance of associated passenger, cargo and mail handling facilities. These changes gave a major boost to West Berlin's fledgeling post-war scheduled air services. On 8 July 1951, BEA transferred its operations from Gatow to Tempelhof, thus concentrating all West Berlin air services at Berlin's iconic city centre airport.Berlin Airport Company – Airline Portrait – British Airways, February 1975 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1975Aircraft Illustrated (Airport Profile – Berlin-Tempelhof), Vol 42, No 1, p. 33, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, January 2009 BEA's move to Tempelhof resulted in a significant increase in passenger numbers, as well as an increase in its Berlin-based fleet to six Douglas DC-3s.Classic Aircraft (Gone but not forgotten ... BEA: Internal German Services – Berlin-bound), Vol. 45, No. 6, p. 51, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, June 2012 From then on, several of the new, wholly privately owned UK independentindependent from government-owned corporations airlines and US supplemental carriersholders of supplemental air carrier certificates authorised to operate non-scheduled passenger and cargo services to supplement the scheduled operations of air carriers ( airlines holding these certificates are also known as \\"nonskeds\\" in the USA) started regular air services to Tempelhof from the UK, the US and West Germany. These airlines initially carried members of the UK and US armed forces stationed in Berlin and their dependants as well as essential raw materials, finished goods manufactured in West Berlin and refugees from East Germany and Eastern Europe, who were still able to freely enter the city prior to the construction of the infamous Berlin Wall. This operation was also known as the Little Berlin Airlift.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, p. 11 One of these airlines, UK independent Dan-Air Services would subsequently play an important role in developing commercial air services from Tegel for a quarter century.The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, pp. 9–11 During the early-to-mid-1950s, BEA leased in aircraft that were bigger than its Tempelhof-based fleet of DC-3/Pionair, Viking and Elizabethan piston-engined airliners from other operators to boost capacity, following a steady increase in the airline's passenger loads.Aeroplane – Letters, B.E.A.'s Berlin services, Vol. 104, No. 2649, p. 7, Temple Press, London, 26 July 1962Aeroplane – World Transport Affairs, B.E.A. leases B.O.A.C.

Compared with the DC-4, the new type had 16 additional seats.Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, pp. 4, 5, 8, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 In 1958, BEA began replacing its piston airliners with Vickers Viscount 701 turboprop aircraft, in a high-density 63-seat single class seating arrangement. Up to ten new, state-of-the-art Vickers Viscount 802s, which featured a more spacious 66-seat single-class seating arrangement, soon replaced the older series 701 aircraft. The greater range and higher cruising speed of the 802 series enabled BEA to inaugurate a non-stop London Heathrow – Berlin Tempelhof service on 1 November 1965. this was the only non-stop international scheduled air service from Tempelhofuntil 1973, the launch of daily, non-stop Berlin Tempelhof – Amsterdam Schiphol flights by Pan Am On 19 November 1959, a Pan Am DC-4 became the first aircraft to operate a scheduled all-cargo service from West Berlin. This service linked Tempelhof with Rhein-Main Airport once-nightly, all year round.Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, pp. 6, 8, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 On 2 January 1960, Air France, which had served Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Munich, Nuremberg and its main base at Paris Le Bourget/Orly during the previous decade with DC-4, Sud-Est Languedoc and Lockheed Constellation/Super Constellation piston-engined equipment, shifted its entire Berlin operation to Tegel because Tempelhof's runways were too short to permit the introduction of the Sud-Aviation Caravelle, their new short-haul jet, with a viable payload.Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, p. 5, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 (Air France's Caravelle IIIs lacked thrust reversers that would have permitted them to land safely on Tempelhof's short runways with a full commercial payload.) On 1 March 1960, Pan Am launched its second dedicated scheduled all-cargo flight from Berlin, linking Tempelhof with Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel.Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, p. 8, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 1960 was also the year Pan Am withdrew its last DC-4 from Tempelhof. As a result, all of the airline's Berlin routes were exclusively served with DC-6Bs as of 27 June of that year. Although the DC-6B was a less advanced aircraft than either the Viscount or the Caravelle, it was more economical. By the early 1960s, Pan Am had a fleet of 15 DC-6Bs stationed at its Tempelhof base,Aeroplane – Tempelhof trials prelude to Pan Am 727 order, Vol. 108, No. 2773, p. 11, Temple Press, London, 10 December 1964Aeroplane – Order Book continued, Pan Am 727s to serve Tempelhof, Vol. 109, No. 2788, p. 14, Temple Press, London, 25 March 1965 which were configured in a higher-density seating arrangement than competing airlines' aircraft. (Pan Am's DC-6Bs were originally configured in a 76-seat, all-economy layout. The subsequent introduction of subsidies for all scheduled internal German services from/to West Berlin resulted in steady network growth as well as service frequency and passenger load increases. To cope with the sharply higher traffic volumes, aircraft seat densities were increased twice – initially to 84 and subsequently 87 seats.) This fleet eventually grew to 17 aircraft, which gave Pan Am the biggest aircraft fleet among the three main scheduled operators flying from West Berlin. It furthermore enabled it to compensate for the DC-6's lack of sophistication with higher frequencies than its competitors, thereby attaining a higher market share (60%) and capturing a greater share of the lucrative business travel market than its rivals. During that period, Pan Am moreover achieved an ultra short-haul load factor of 70% on its eight scheduled internal routes from Berlin, making the airline's Berlin routes the most profitable in its worldwide scheduled network.Aircraft Illustrated (Airport Profile – Berlin-Tempelhof), Vol 42, No 1, p. 30, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, January 2009 Following the completion of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, the West German government introduced a route-specific subsidy of up to 20% for all internal German scheduled air services from and to West Berlin to help the airlines cope with the resulting falloff in traffic and maintain an economically viable operation on these lifeline routes. These came into effect on 1 March 1962 for all tickets sold in Germany, including Berlin.Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, pp. 5, 8, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 (To qualify for the subsidised rate under this system, the passenger was required to purchase a round-trip ticket for a scheduled internal German flight from/to West Berlin in Germany. Once he/she had checked-in at the airport, the airline collected a coupon attached to his/her ticket, which was subsequently handed in to the relevant German authorities for reimbursement.) By the early 1960s, a number of UK independents and US supplementals began operating regular charter flights from Tempelhof. These carried both inbound tourists from the US, the UK and other countries as well as local outbound tourists to the emerging holiday resorts in the Mediterranean. London Gatwick-based UK independent Overseas Aviation (CI) was among the first airlines the Allied Air Attachés in Bonnin the Cold War era the American, British and French embassies in West Germany's capital Bonn each had a military attaché attached, who was dealing with commercial aviation matters in West Berlin;the three Allied Air Attachés jointly exercised sole responsibility for commercial aviation in West Berlin on behalf of the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and France during this period licensed to operate a series of regular charter flights from West Berlin. It used Vikings and Argonauts on these services, which operated from Tempelhof under contract to the Berlin Senate and the city's Technical University as well as Berliner Flugring, a local package tour operator that began as a consortium of 70 West Berlin travel agents arranging IT flights to holiday resorts in Europe.Berlin Airport Company, April 1968 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1968 By 1964, BEA operated up to 20,000 flights each year from and to Berlin. These represented approximately half of the airline's total yearly flights to/from Germany and generated profits of £1 million per year. 1964 was also the year US supplemental Saturn Airways began operating a comprehensive inclusive tour (IT) charter flight programme from Tempelhof under contract to local package holiday consolidator Flug-Union Berlin,at the time, Flug-Union acted as a West Berlin consolidator for the big West German tour companies Neckermann (then part of the eponymous department store chain) and Touristik Union International (TUI), the travel arm of the Federal German Railway; it subsequently became a tour opeartor in its own right, when it launched its first dedicated package tour flight programme with Laker Airways from Tegel Airport in August 1968 using Douglas DC-6A/Cs and DC-7Cs.Aviation News – Saturn Airways, Vol. 74, No. 3, p. 49, Key Publishing, Stamford, March 2012Detour via Schönefeld (translated article title), Aviation (translated section title), Der Spiegel vol. 29, 1971, 12 July 1971, p. 41 Beyer, Morton S. Flying Higher: General Acceptance Corp. Buys Modern Air, 2009, p. 189 On 2 December of that year, a Boeing 727-100 became the first jet aircraft to land at Tempelhof. Boeing had leased the aircraft to Pan Am for a special flight from Frankfurt to Berlin to demonstrate to the airline the 727's ability to operate from Tempelhof's short runways. Pan Am indicated its intention to place an order for six 727s for its Berlin operation, as a result of the aircraft using only half the runway during landing.Aeroplane – The Battle of Berlin, Vol. 111, No. 2842, p. 15, Temple Press, London, 7 April 1966 26 October 1965 marked British Aircraft Corporation's new One-Eleven jet's first arrival at Tempelhof when a British United 200 series operating a trooping flight under contract to the UK Ministry of Defence diverted from Gatow.Aeroplane – Late News (Commercial), BAC One-Elevens are to take over trooping flights between the UK and Germany ..., Vol. 110, No. 2815, p. 34, Temple Press, London, 30 September 1965 22 January 1966 marked the first appearance of a British trijet at Tempelhof when Hawker Siddeley flew in its HS 121 Trident 1Ean improved version of the original Trident 1C BEA already operated, which lacked a short-field capability that would have made it suitable for the airline's Tempelhof operation demonstrator aircraftthe first production aircraft for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), with the aircraft's Pakistani registration AP-ATK and PIA titles being both temporarily replaced with British registration G-ATNA and BEA titles to comply with contemporary Allied access restrictions on air transport in West Berlin for evaluation by BEA.Classic Airliner (The Hawker Siddeley Trident: photographic captions), p. 40, Key Publishing, Stamford, 2014 A week later, on 29 January, BEA began evaluating the BAC One-Eleven's suitability for its Berlin operations, with the start of a series of test flights conducted on its behalf by BAC's 475 series demonstrator. This included a number of takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof to test the aircraft's short-field performance.Aeroplane – BEA Berlin services: new jet needed?, Vol. 111, No. 2834, p. 15, Temple Press, London, 10 February 1966 On 18 March 1966, Pan Am became the first airline to commence regular, year-round jet operations from Tempelhof with the first examples of a brand-new fleet of an initial eight Boeing 727-100 series, one of the first jet aircraft with a short-field capability.Aeroplane – Commercial continued, Pan Am 727s take over in Berlin, Vol. 111, No. 2853, p. 11, Temple Press, London, 23 June 1966Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, pp. 4, 5, 6, 8, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968Aircraft Illustrated (Airport Profile – Berlin-Tempelhof), Vol 42, No 1, p. 34, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, January 2009 These aircraft were configured in a single class featuring 128 economy seats. Pan Am's move put BEA at a considerable competitive disadvantage, especially on the busy Berlin–Frankfurt route where the former out-competed the latter with both modern jet planes as well as a higher flight frequency. BEA responded to Pan Am's competitive threat by increasing the Berlin-based fleet to 13 Viscounts by winter 1966/7 to enable it to offer higher frequencies.Aeroplane (Supplement: BEA's 20th anniversary) – BEA: German internals, Vol. 112, No. 2858, p. 42, Temple Press, London, 28 July 1966 This entailed re-configuring aircraft cabins in a lower- density seating arrangement, as a result of which the refurbished cabins featured only 53, Comet-type first-class seats in a four-abreast layout instead of 66, five-abreast economy seats. In addition, BEA sought to differentiate itself from its main competitor by providing a superior in- flight catering standard. (BEA's Silver Star service included complimentary hot meals on all flights whereas Pan Am merely offered free on-board snacks. Sections of the local press dubbed the contrasting strategies of the two main protagonists plying the internal German routes from Berlin – estimated to be worth £15–20 million in annual revenues – the Dinner oder Düsen? (Dinner or Jet?) battle.) Henceforth, the airline marketed these services as Super Silver Star.Aeroplane – The Battle of Berlin, Vol. 111, No. 2842, pp. 16/7, Temple Press, London, 7 April 1966Aeroplane – The Battle for Berlin: Round One a draw, Vol. 112, No. 2878, p. 4, Temple Press, London, 15 December 1966 The introduction of Pan Am's 727s to the Berlin market represented a major step change because of the aircraft's ability to carry more passengers than any other contemporary aircraft type used by scheduled carriers in the short-haul Berlin market, and its ability to take off from and land on Tempelhof's short runways with a full commercial payload as only light fuel loads were required on the short internal German services. Compared with BEA, Pan Am's 727s carried 20% more passengers than the British carrier's Comet 4Bsfrom August 1968 and up to 2½ times as many passengers as the latter's Viscounts.Silver Star configuration Within two years of Pan Am's introduction of jet equipment on the bulk of its internal German services from/to West Berlin, its market share rose from 58% to 68%. Despite the huge increase in capacity over the DC-6B (128 vs. 87 seats), load factors dropped during the first year of operations only. (Pan Am's second year of jet operations from Tempelhof saw load factors steadying while the third saw a slight increase.Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, p. 6, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968) The lower seat density in BEA's re-configured Viscounts combined with higher flight frequencies, superior catering and increased promotion proved insufficient to counter the appeal of Pan Am's new jets, which were laid out in a comparatively tight, pitch seating configuration. This resulted in BEA's market share declining from 38% at the beginning of this period to 27% at its end. On the other hand, BEA's reduced capacity in the domestic air travel market between West Berlin and West Germany enabled it to attain higher load factors than its competitors.Aeroplane – The Battle of Berlin, Vol. 111, No. 2842, p. 16, Temple Press, London, 7 April 1966Aeroplane – Pan Am and the IGS, Vol. 116, No. 2972, pp. 5–6, Temple Press, London, 2 October 1968 From August 1968, BEA supplemented its Tempelhof-based Viscount fleet with de Havilland Comet 4B series jetliners. Although these aircraft could operate from Tempelhof's short runways with a restricted payload, they were not suited to the airline's ultra short-haul operation from Berlin (average stage length: ) given the high fuel consumption of the Comet, especially when operating at the mandatory altitude inside the Allied air corridors.Classic Airliner (The Hawker Siddeley Trident: German internal services), p. 38, Key Publishing, Stamford, 2014\\"BEA in Berlin\\", Flight International, 10 August 1972, p. 181\\"En route with BEA, One-Eleven 500 into service\\", Flight International, 7 November 1968, p. 749 This measure was therefore only a stopgap until most of BEA's Berlin fleet was equipped with 97-seat, single-class BAC One-Eleven 500s.the temporary use of Comet 4Bs on BEA's Berlin routes enabled Viscount crews to undergo conversion training on the One-Eleven BEA's re-equipment of its Berlin fleet with brand-new One-Eleven 500 jets was central to the airline's competitive strategy to regain ground lost to Pan Am's 727s. The new One- Eleven 500, which BEA called the Super One-Eleven, operated its first scheduled service from Berlin on 1 September 1968.\\"One-Eleven 500 into service\\" Flight International, 7 November 1968, p. 744/5\\"Bespoke for BEA\\", One-Eleven 500 into service, Flight International, 7 November 1968, p. 746 It began replacing the airline's Berlin-based Viscounts from 17 November 1968. 1968 was also the year all non-scheduled services, i.e. primarily the rapidly growing number of inclusive tour charter flights, were concentrated at Tegel to alleviate increasing congestion at Tempelhof and to make better use of Tegel, which was underutilised at the time. Air France, West Berlin's third scheduled carrier, which had suffered a continuous traffic decline ever since the transfer of Berlin operations to more distant Tegel at the beginning of 1960 due to Tempelhof's operational limitations that made it unsuitable for its Caravelles,from a peak of 11% of all West Berlin scheduled air traffic prior to the move from Tempelhof was worst affected by the equipment changes at the latter airport during the mid-to-late 1960s. Over this period, the French airline's market share halved from 9% to less than 5% despite having withdrawn from Tegel–Düsseldorf in summer 1964Air France had already discontinued Berlin–Nuremberg services prior to its move to Tegel and concentrated its limited resources on Tegel–Frankfurt and Tegel–Munich to maximise the competitive impact on the latter two routes. To reverse growing losses on its Berlin routes resulting from load factors as low as 30%, Air France decided to withdraw from the internal German market entirely and instead enter into a joint venture with BEA. This arrangement entailed the latter taking over the former's two remaining German domestic routes to Frankfurt and Munich and operating these with its own aircraft and flightdeck crews from Tempelhof. It also entailed repainting the fins of the BEA One- Eleven 500s in a neutral, dark-blue scheme featuring Super One-Eleven titles instead of BEA's \\"Speedjack\\" motif. The Air France-BEA joint venture became operational in spring 1969 and terminated in autumn 1972.Berlin Airport Company, November 1972 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1972 Commercial air traffic from/to Berlin Tempelhof peaked in 1971 at just above 5½ million passengers (out of a total of 6.12 million passengers for all West Berlin airports during that yearTempelhof: 5,560,000; Tegel: 560,000). This represented more than 90% of West Berlin's commercial air traffic and made its iconic city centre airport Germany's second-largest.after Frankfurt, in terms of passengers handled per annum With 3½ million passengers, Pan Am accounted for the bulk of this traffic while almost all of the remaining 2 million accrued to BEA. 1971 was also the year the latter's last Berlin-based Viscount departed the city.Berlin Airport Company, November 1971 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1971 Nord 262 of Tempelhof Airways, Airport Berlin Tempelhof, 1988 A BAe 146 of Brussels Airlines, Airport Tempelhof, 2004 East Germany's relaxation of border controls affecting all surface transport modes between West Berlin and West Germany across its territory from 1972 onwards resulted in a decline of scheduled internal German air traffic from/to West Berlin. This was further compounded by the economic downturn in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis. The resulting fare increases that were intended to recover the airlines' higher operating costs caused by steeply rising jet fuel prices led to a further drop in demand. This in turn resulted in a major contraction of Pan Am's and BEA's/British Airways's internal German operations, necessitating a reduction in both airlines' Berlin-based fleets and workforces in an attempt to contain growing losses these once profitable routes generated by the mid-1970s. On 1 September 1975, Pan Am and British Airways moved their entire Berlin operation to the newly built terminal at Tegel Airport. Following Pan Am's and British Airways's move to Tegel, commercial operations at Tempelhof ceased, resulting in exclusive use by the US military. From 1978, Pan Am relocated its 727 flightdeck crew training from Miami International Airport to Berlin Tempelhof. This involved [re-]training all pilots and flight engineers who manned the flight decks of the airline's 727 fleet, which at the time operated out of Miami to the Caribbean and Central America, as well as on the IGS routes from Berlin and intra-European feeder routes serving Frankfurt and Heathrow.Berlin Airport Company – Summary of 1978 Annual Report, February 1979 Monthly Timetable Booklet for Berlin Tegel Airport, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1979 Dix, Barry, Fly Past: Happy landings, Skyport Heathrow.co.uk, 14 April 2011 Another airline that used Tempelhof to train its flightdeck crews was US supplemental Modern Air Transport. While all Modern Air commercial flights from and to Berlin principally used Tegel to take advantage of that airport's longer runways and the fact that it was not in a built-up area making for easier approaches, the airline conducted its training for Berlin-based flight deck crews at Tempelhof between 1968 and 1974. The latter was also the US supplemental's (and other Tegel-based operators') designated diversion airport in bad weather in the Tegel area.Airways (Proctor, J., Archive, Modern Air Transport), Vol. 24, No. 03, Iss. 255, p. 65, Airways International Inc., Miami, May 2017 Commercial operations restarted in 1981, when US-incorporated regional airline start-up Tempelhof Airways began a corporate shuttle between Tempelhof and Paderborn under contract to former German computer manufacturer Nixdorf whose main factories and offices were located in Paderborn and West Berlin respectively. Tempelhof Airways's initial equipment comprised Cessna Conquest and Piper Navajo executive aircraft. In 1985, the airline converted the Tempelhof–Paderborn corporate shuttle into a full-fledged scheduled service using a Nord 262 commuter turboprop. The end of the Cold War and German reunification opened Tempelhof for non-allied air traffic on 3 October 1990. US President Bill Clinton christened a new Boeing C-17 Globemaster III transport plane (serial number 96-0006) the Spirit of Berlin at Tempelhof on 12 May 1998, to commemorate the 49th anniversary of the end of the Berlin Blockade on 12 May 1949. Towards the end, commercial use was mostly in the form of small commuter aircraft flying regionally. Plans had been in place to shut down Tempelhof and Tegel, and make the new Brandenburg Airport the sole commercial airport for Berlin. =Closing down air traffic= 230px In 1996, the mayor of Berlin Eberhard Diepgen, Brandenburg minister-president Manfred Stolpe and the federal transport minister Wissmann established the so-called \\"Consensus resolution\\". The entire planning aimed at concentrating domestic and international air traffic in Berlin and Brandenburg at one airport: Berlin-Schönefeld International Airport.Official public information brochure of the pros and cons of the referendum . To ensure investment protection as well as to fend off opposition to Schönefeld International's expansion, it was mandated that first Tempelhof and then Tegel must be closed. On 4 December 2007, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany (Bundesverwaltungsgericht) made the final decision as court of last instance to close Tempelhof Airport.Grünes Licht für Schließung des Flughafens Berlin-Tempelhof.

A majority of the votes was necessary to support the referendum, but this had to be at least one quarter of all eligible Berlin voters.Official public information brochure of the pros and cons of the referendum Official press release on the referendum The initiative for keeping Tempelhof open was supported by the Interessengemeinschaft City-Airport Tempelhof (ICAT) along with a couple of opposition parties in the Berlin city parliament: the Christian Democratic Union and the Free Democratic Party citing primarily the need for an inner- city airport for business and private flyers as well as nostalgic reasons. Representatives from the ICAT suggested keeping the airport open up until Schönefeld Airport was to be completed in about 2012. The Berlin government insisted on the closure of the airport for legal, long-term economic, and environmental reasons, in particular to ensure the expansion of Schönefeld International. Environmental groups and the Green party supported them in this. Plans for the future would include for example a Berlin airlift museum in the old terminal building, commercial space for innovative businesses, new housing and industrial areas, sports facilities, and parks. Legally the decision in favour of closure at the end of October 2008 was irrevocableBBI Press release: Berlin Airports welcome BBI decision by the Federal Constitutional Court on BBI and the referendum was nonbinding. A subsequent reopening would have faced high legal barriers; but some legal experts claimed there may be means to circumvent this. The referendum of 27 April 2008 failed. Although 60.2% of the votes cast were for keeping the airport open, this was by only 21.7% of the eligible voters; short of the 25% required. Support had been highest in western districts of Berlin (up to 80%), but opposition (only 30% approval) and disinterest was prevalent in the eastern districts. Voter turnout of 36% was low.Official results of the referendum published by the municipal election supervisor Air traffic at Tempelhof Airport ceased for good on 30 October and the official licence expired in mid-December. A \\"Goodbye Tempelhof\\" gala was held at Tempelhof airport for eight hundred invited guests in the last hours of 30 October. Meanwhile, protesters against the closing held a candle vigil in front on the Platz der Lufbrücke. The last commercial flight was a Cirrus Airlines Dornier 328 that departed at 22:17 towards Mannheim.Klaus Kurpjuweit and Jan Oberländer, \\"Ende der Legende\\", Der Tagesspiegel 31 October 2008 \\"Time to say goodbye\\" was sung to the spectators on the apron at the conclusion.

The runway and air field lights were switched off at midnight. Three Antonov An-2 airplanes flying under VFR were left stranded at the airport, as weather conditions prevented them from taking off on 30 October. They were allowed to take off on 24 November 2008, making them the last aircraft to take off from the airport.\\"Abflug in die Geschichtsbücher\\", Tagesspiegel 25 November 2008 =Post-airport usage= An area of Tempelhof Airport in 2012, converted into open greenspace.

The first major events included a fashion tradeshow in JulyBREAD & BUTTER BERLIN Airport Berlin-Tempelhof and the Berlin Festival 2009 concert in August. Fairs were held in the hangar. In September 2010, Tempelhof hosted the Popkomm, international world's music and entertainment business meeting place and was one of the most important locations of the first Berlin Music Week. The place also hosted sports events. The Berlin Marathon fair, the main event preparation to runners, was held at Tempelhof every September. The FIA Formula E Championship raced on the airport runways in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2020 - the latter of which hosted 6 races in a nine day period to complete the 2019/20 season.The Red Bull Air Race World Championship by Red Bull, featuring aerial obstacle courses which pilots have to navigate under high velocity forces, was held at the airport in 2006.Berlin completes Formula E calendar – Autosport, 11 July 2013 The Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters executives were also discussing with government officials about hosting a round at Tempelhof.Tempelhof-Pläne doch noch nicht vom Tisch? – Motorsport Total, 17 June 2013 In August 2009, Berlin city officials announced that Tempelhof would be opened in May 2010 as a city park. The city planned to spend an estimated €60 million on developing the park from 2010 to 2017. On the weekend of 8/9 May 2010, the outfield was festively opened as Berlin's largest public park named \\"Tempelhofer Feld\\". More than 200,000 Berliners visited the park to enjoy its wide open spaces for recreation ranging from biking and skating to baseball and kiting.Article and photos \\"Riesiger Andrang auf dem Flugfeld Tempelhof\\" Berliner Morgenpost, 10 May 2010 \\"Flughafen Tempelhof: Die neue Rollbahn\\" flughafentempelhof.com, 9 May 2010 \\"Tempelhof Kiteflyers Meeting 2010 am 9.

The grounds are currently (mid-September 2015) maintained by Grün Berlin,Grün Berlin's Tempelhofer Feld Project a company that also looks after several other gated parks in Berlin. Originally the intention was for the Tempelhof fields to be used as a park indefinitely. This was manifested for instance by plans to host the 2017 IGA, Germany's world horticultural exhibition.\\"DBG elects Berlin as host for the 2017 IGA\\" FloraCulture International, 20 November 2009 There was a planned September 2013, kite-energy demonstration at the Tempelhof field like some kite festivals there.Kite festival in Tempelhof Field at Berlin Tempelhof field had been at risk of being closed down as a park and being opened to construction in 2014, but in a referendum, Berlin's citizens decided to keep using the field as a public park. In September 2015 it was announced that the airport would become an 'emergency refugee shelter' for at least 1,200 refugees, but they are free to come and go from the main terminal building and their presence has not affected public access to the park. About 80% of the former airfield is an important habitat for several redlisted birds, plants and insects.\\"Ein Lebensraum für Flora und Fauna\\" Usage of the park was restricted to limit disturbance of some of these habitats. When Eurovision came to Germany, the airport would have been where the contest would’ve taken place if Berlin was chosen as the host city. Later, Düsseldorf was chosen to host the contest. The defunct airport is intended to be known as \\"Berlin Creative District\\", similar to Meatpacking District, Manhattan or Brompton Design District in Brompton, London. For instance, the former US Army officers' hotel will be altered to be a digital innovation center for startups and creative businesses, while a new visitor center was due to open in 2019. Airlines and destinations Scandinavian Airlines McDonnell Douglas MD-87 at Berlin Tempelhof Airport in April 1995 Most airlines moved to Tegel or Schönefeld in the years before Tempelhof closed down. When it was actually closed down in 2008 there were only scheduled flights from Brussels Airlines and Cirrus Airlines still operating from there. Berlin Tempelhof also was an important base for air taxi services with the following operators flying from/to there: AAF Aviona Air, Air Service Berlin (scheduled sightseeing flights using a historic \\"raisin bomber\\" Douglas DC-3),operated from Berlin- Schönefeld Airport starting November 2008 AIRSHIP Air Service, Bizair Fluggesellschaft, Business Air Charter, Heli Unionair, Jet Club Deutschland Chartermanagement, Private Wings, Rotorflug, TAG Aviation and Windrose Air. Accidents and incidents On 12 June 1897, in one of the earliest recorded aircraft accidents, Friedrich Hermann Wölfert and his mechanic Robert Knabe were killed when Wölfert's lighter than air craft Deutschland caught fire at 200 m (670 ft) and crashed at Tempelhof Field. On 29 April 1952, an Air France Douglas C-54A (registration F-BELI) operating a scheduled service from Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport to Berlin Tempelhof came under sustained attack from two Soviet MiG 15 fighters while passing through one of the Allied air corridors over East Germany. Although the attack had severely damaged the plane, necessitating the shutdown of engines number three and four, the pilot in command of the aircraft managed to carry out a safe emergency landing at Tempelhof Airport. A subsequent inspection of the aircraft's damage at Tempelhof revealed that it had been hit by 89 shots fired from the Soviet MiGs during the preceding air attack. There were no fatalities among the 17 occupants (six crew, 11 passengers) despite the severity of the attack. The Soviet military authorities defended this attack on an unarmed civilian aircraft by claiming the Air France plane was outside the air corridor at the time of attack. On 19 January 1953, a Silver City Airways Bristol 170 Freighter Mark 21 (registration: G-AICM) operating a non-scheduled cargo flight from West Berlin crash-landed near Tempelhof Airport as a result of fuel starvation when bad weather at the destination forced it to return to Berlin. Although the accident damaged the aircraft beyond repair, both pilots survived. In 1978, LOT Polish Airlines flight 165 was hijacked and forced to land at Tempelhof. The US military authorities who were in charge of Tempelhof during the Cold War era arrested the East German hijacker on arrival. Following the hijacker's arrest, the US authorities returned the aircraft, its crew and those passengers who wished to resume their journey to Poland. In 1981, a LOT Polish Airlines Antonov AN-24 operating an internal scheduled service from Katowice to Gdańsk was hijacked en route and forced to land at Tempelhof. Jerzy Dygas, the hijacker, was on military service while taking over the aircraft. He was armed with a grenade and a single-shot pistol. The US military authorities arrested the hijacker on arrival and handed him over to the local police. At that time, he was expected to be sentenced to a five- and-a-half years prison term under West German law. Following the hijacker's arrest, the US authorities released the aircraft, its crew and all 50 passengers to resume their flight to Gdańsk. On 26 June 2010, a private Socata TB 10 Tobago had to perform an emergency landing on the now closed Tempelhof Airport due to engine failure. It was on a sightseeing flight and the pilot was looking for a free space to land safely. The aircraft was occupied by the pilot and three passengers and had taken off from Tegel Airport. Upon consultation with air traffic control in Schönefeld, it was agreed to land on a Tempelhof runway. No one was injured during the emergency landing as the visitors of the now Tempelhofer Park scurried aside to make room for the TB 10, which came to a halt after a very short distance.Jörn Hasselmann, Pilot: \\"Ich hatte Befürchtungen, dass ich nicht bis Tempelhof komme\\", Tagesspiegel 26 June 2010 (\\"I feared, I wouldn't reach Tempelhof\\") Four days later, the Socata TB 10 Tobago was transported – with wings removed – by lorry back to Tegel airport.

After petroleum jelly became a medicine chest staple, consumers began to use it for cosmetic purposes and for many ailments including toenail fungus, genital rashes (non-STD), nosebleeds, diaper rash, and common colds. Its folkloric medicinal value as a \\"cure-all\\" has since been limited by better scientific understanding of appropriate and inappropriate uses. It is recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an approved over-the-counter (OTC) skin protectant and remains widely used in cosmetic skin care (where it's often loosely referred to as mineral oil).  History  Original US patent application for the Vaseline product The raw material for petroleum jelly was discovered in 1859 in Titusville, Pennsylvania, US, on some of the country's first oil rigs. Workers disliked the paraffin-like material forming on rigs because it caused them to malfunction, but they used it on cuts and burns because they believed that it hastened healing.The History of Vaseline Petroleum Jelly began in the Pennsylvania Oil Fields!, Drake Well Museum pamphlet, copyright 1996 by Holigan Group Ltd, Dallas, Texas. Robert Chesebrough, a young chemist whose previous work of distilling fuel from the oil of sperm whales had been rendered obsolete by petroleum, went to Titusville to see what new materials had commercial potential. Chesebrough took the unrefined black \\"rod wax\\", as the drillers called it, back to his laboratory to refine it and explore potential uses. He discovered that by distilling the lighter, thinner oil products from the rod wax, he could create a light-colored gel. Chesebrough patented the process of making petroleum jelly by in 1872. The process involved vacuum distillation of the crude material followed by filtration of the still residue through bone char. Chesebrough traveled around New York demonstrating the product to encourage sales by burning his skin with acid or an open flame, then spreading the ointment on his injuries and showing his past injuries healed, he claimed, by his miracle product. He opened his first factory in 1870 in Brooklyn using the name Vaseline.  Physical properties  Petroleum jelly is a mixture of hydrocarbons, with a melting point that depends on the exact proportions. The melting point is typically between . It is flammable only when heated to liquid; then the fumes will light, not the liquid itself, so a wick material like leaves, bark, or small twigs is needed to ignite petroleum jelly. It is colorless or has a pale yellow color (when not highly distilled), translucent, and devoid of taste and smell when pure. It does not oxidize on exposure to the air and is not readily acted on by chemical reagents. It is insoluble in water. It is soluble in dichloromethane, chloroform, benzene, diethyl ether, carbon disulfide and turpentine.Vaseline (Petroleum Jelly) Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) (June 15, 2007). MakingCosmetics.com Inc. Retrieved August 5, 2011. It acts as a plasticizer on polypropylene (PP), but is compatible with most other plastics. It is a semi- solid, in that it holds its shape indefinitely like a solid, but it can be forced to take the shape of its container without breaking apart, like a liquid, though it does not flow on its own. Depending on the specific application of petroleum jelly, it may be USP, B.P., or Ph. Eur. grade. This pertains to the processing and handling of the petroleum jelly so it is suitable for medicinal and personal-care applications.  Uses  Most uses of petroleum jelly exploit its lubricating and coating properties, including use on dry lips and dry skin. Below are some examples of the uses of petroleum jelly. = Medical treatment = Vaseline brand First Aid Petroleum Jelly, or carbolated petroleum jelly containing phenol to give the jelly additional antibacterial effect, has been discontinued. During World War II, a variety of petroleum jelly called red veterinary petrolatum, or Red Vet Pet for short, was often included in life raft survival kits. Acting as a sunscreen, it provides protection against ultraviolet rays. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends keeping skin injuries moist with petroleum jelly to reduce scarring. A verified medicinal use is to protect and prevent moisture loss of the skin of a patient in the initial post-operative period following laser skin resurfacing. There is one case report published in 1994 indicating petroleum jelly should not be applied to the inside of the nose due to the risk of lipid pneumonia, but this was only ever reported in one patient. However, petroleum jelly is used extensively by otolaryngologists--ear, nose, and throat surgeons--for nasal moisture and epistaxis treatment, and to combat nasal crusting. Large studies have found petroleum jelly applied to the nose for short durations to have no significant side effects.Loughran S, Spinou E, Clement WA, et al. A prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial of petroleum jelly/Vaseline for recurrent paediatric epistaxis. Clin Otolaryngol 2004; 29:266–269. Historically, it was also consumed for internal use and even promoted as \\"Vaseline confection\\". = Skin and hair care = Most petroleum jelly today is used as an ingredient in skin lotions and cosmetics, providing various types of skin care and protection by minimizing friction or reducing moisture loss, or by functioning as a grooming aid, e. g. pomade.  Preventing moisture loss  By reducing moisture loss, petroleum jelly can prevent chapped hands and lips, and soften nail cuticles. This property is exploited to provide heat insulation: petroleum jelly can be used to keep swimmers warm in water when training or during channel crossings or long ocean swims. It can prevent chilling of the face due to evaporation of skin moisture during cold weather outdoor sports.  Hair grooming  In the first part of the twentieth century, petroleum jelly, either pure or as an ingredient, was also popular as a hair pomade. When used in a 50/50 mixture with pure beeswax, it makes an effective moustache wax.  Skin lubrication  Petroleum jelly can be used to reduce the friction between skin and clothing during various sport activities, for example to prevent chafing of the seat region of cyclists or the nipples of long distance runners wearing loose T-shirts, and is commonly used in the groin area of wrestlers and footballers. Petroleum jelly is commonly used as a personal lubricant because it does not dry out like water-based lubricants, and has a distinctive \\"feel\\", different from that of K-Y and related methylcellulose products. However, it is not recommended for use with condoms during sexual activity because it swells latex and thus increases the chance of rupture. = Product care and protection =  Coating  Petroleum jelly can be used to coat corrosion-prone items such as metallic trinkets, non-stainless steel blades, and gun barrels prior to storage as it serves as an excellent and inexpensive water repellent. It is used as an environmentally friendly underwater antifouling coating for motor boats and sailing yachts. It was recommended in the Porsche owner's manual as a preservative for light alloy (alleny) anodized Fuchs wheels to protect them against corrosion from road salts and brake dust. “Every three months (after regular cleaning) the wheels should be coated with petroleum jelly.”P. 61 Porsche Owner’s Manual 911 Turbo 911 Carrera WKD91102187  Finishing  It can be used to finish and protect wood, much like a mineral oil finish. It is used to condition and protect smooth leather products like bicycle saddles, boots, motorcycle clothing, and used to put a shine on patent leather shoes (when applied in a thin coat and then gently buffed off).  Lubrication  Petroleum jelly can be used to lubricate zippers and slide rules. It was also recommended by Porsche in maintenance training documentation for lubrication (after cleaning) of \\"Weatherstrips on Doors, Hood, Tailgate, Sun Roof\\". The publication states \\"…before applying a new coat of lubricant…\\" \\"Only acid-free lubricants may be used, for example: glycerine, Vaseline, tire mounting paste, etc. These lubricants should be rubbed in, and excessive lubricant wiped off with a soft cloth.\\"P.16 928S Maintenance and General Repairs - Service Training Center WKS006021 It is used in bullet lubricant compounds. Petrolatum is also used as a light lubricating grease as well as an anti-seize assembling grease.http://www.armitelabs.com/products/VV-P-236_Lubricating_Grease.html = Industrial production processes = Petroleum jelly is a useful material when incorporated into candle wax formulas. The petroleum jelly softens the overall blend, allows the candle to incorporate additional fragrance oil, and facilitates adhesion to the sidewall of the glass. Petroleum jelly is used to moisten nondrying modelling clay such as plasticine, as part of a mix of hydrocarbons including those with greater (paraffin wax) and lesser (mineral oil) molecular weights. It is used as a tack reducer additive to printing inks to reduce paper lint \\"picking\\" from uncalendered paper stocks. It can be used as a release agent for plaster molds and castings. It is used in the leather industry as a waterproofing cream. =Other= Explosives Petroleum jelly is mixed with a high proportion of strong inorganic chlorates due to it acting as a plasticizer and a fuel source. An example of this is Cheddite C which consists of a ratio of 9:1, KClO3 to petroleum jelly. This mixture is unable to detonate without the use of a blasting cap. It is also used as a stabiliser in the manufacture of the propellant Cordite.  Mechanical, barrier functions  Petroleum jelly can be used to fill copper or fibre- optic cables using plastic insulation to prevent the ingress of water, see icky-pick. Petroleum jelly can be used to coat the inner walls of terrariums to prevent animals crawling out and escaping. A stripe of petroleum jelly can be used to prevent the spread of a liquid. For example, it can be applied close to the hairline when using a home hair dye kit to prevent the hair dye from irritating or staining the skin. It is also used to prevent diaper rash.  Surface cleansing  Petroleum jelly is used to gently clean a variety of surfaces, ranging from makeup removal from faces to tar stain removal from leather.  Pet care  Petroleum jelly is used to moisturize the paws of dogs,. It is a common ingredient in hairball remedies for domestic cats. https://www.spca.org/Document.Doc?id=87 Petroleum jelly is slightly soluble in alcohol.  Health  In 2015, German consumer watchdog Stiftung Warentest analyzed cosmetics containing mineral oils. After developing a new detection method they found high concentrations of Mineral Oil Aromatic Hydrocarbons (MOAH) and even polyaromatics in products containing mineral oils with Vaseline products containing the most MOAH of all tested cosmetics (up to 9%). The European Food Safety Authority sees MOHA and polyaromatics as possibly carcinogenic. Based on the results, Stiftung Warentest warns not to use Vaseline or any product that is based on mineral oils for lip care. A study published in 2017 found at most 1% MOAH in petroleum jelly, and less than 1% in petroleum jelly based beauty products.

It is located 3 miles (4.9 km) from Aylesbury and 3.4 miles (5.5 km) from the market town of Wendover. Although a separate civil parish, the village falls within the Aylesbury Urban Area. According to the Census Report the area of this parish is . Stoke Mandeville Hospital, although named after the village, is located on the parish's border with Aylesbury. The hospital has the largest spinal injuries ward in Europe, and is the birthplace of the Paralympic movement. History The village was originally recorded as Stoches in the Domesday Book of 1086, from the Old English word stoc meaning an outlying farm or hamlet. The suffix Mandeville was first recorded in 1284 when the manor was listed as being in the hands of the powerful Norman de Mandeville family. The former medieval parish church on the outskirts of the village was condemned in the mid 20th Century and was demolished in January 1966. The newer red brick parish church of St Mary, consecrated in July 1866 by Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, remains as the only church in the village apart from the Methodist church in Eskdale Road. Stoke Mandeville was also the location of the Stoke Mandeville Games, which first took place in 1948 thanks to doctor Ludwig Guttmann and are now known as the IWAS World Games. The Games, which were held eight times at Stoke Mandeville, were the inspiration for the first Paralympic Games, also called The Stoke Mandeville Games, which were organised in Rome in 1960. The wheelchair aspects of the 1984 Paralympics were also held in the village. The London 2012 Summer Paralympics mascot, Mandeville, was named after the village due to its legacy with the Games. Stoke Mandeville Stadium was developed alongside the hospital and is the National Centre for Disability Sport in the United Kingdom, enhancing the hospital as a world centre for paraplegics and spinal injuries. On 13 May 2000, the new Stoke Mandeville Millennium sign was unveiled. It stands on a small brick plinth on the green outside the primary school. The sign shows aspects of village life over the centuries. Transport Stoke Mandeville railway station is on the London to Aylesbury Line between Aylesbury station and Wendover station, served by Chiltern Railways, which terminates at Aylesbury Vale Parkway northbound and London Marylebone southbound. Arriva Shires & Essex number 50 bus also serves the area on Station Road, as do services 164 and 300 - which stops in the centre of the village.http://www.arrivabus.co.uk/serviceInformation.aspx?id=12508 Education Stoke Mandeville Combined School is a mixed community school which takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The school has approximately 220 pupils. It also has a hearing impaired department, which currently helps up to 15 children through their school day.

Described as \\"the bard of American theater\\" and \\"one of the greatest contemporary playwrights the theater world has yet produced,\\" McNally was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1996. He received the 2019 Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement, the Dramatists Guild Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011, and the Lucille Lortel Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2018, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the highest recognition of artistic merit in the United States. He received the Tony Award for Best Play for Love! Valour! Compassion! and Master Class, as well as the Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical for Kiss of the Spider Woman and Ragtime. His other accolades included an Emmy Award, two Guggenheim Fellowships, a Rockefeller Grant, four Drama Desk Awards, two Lucille Lortel Awards, two Obie Awards, and three Hull-Warriner Awards. His career spanned six decades, and his plays, musicals, and operas were routinely performed all over the world. He also wrote screenplays, teleplays, and a memoir. Active in the regional and off-Broadway theatre movements as well as on Broadway, he was one of the few playwrights of his generation to have successfully passed from the avant-garde to mainstream acclaim. His work centered on the difficulties of and urgent need for human connection. He was vice-president of the Council of the Dramatists Guild from 1981 to 2001. He died of complications from COVID-19 on March 24, 2020, at a hospital in Florida. Early life and education McNally was born November 3, 1938, in St. Petersburg, Florida, to Hubert Arthur and Dorothy Katharine (Rapp) McNally, two transplanted New Yorkers from Irish Catholic backgrounds. His parents ran a seaside bar and grill called The Pelican Club, but after a hurricane destroyed the establishment, the family briefly relocated to Port Chester, New York, then to Dallas, Texas, and finally to Corpus Christi, Texas. There Hubert McNally purchased and managed a Schlitz beer distributorship, and McNally attended W.B. Ray High School. Despite his distance from New York City, McNally's parents enjoyed Broadway musicals. When McNally was eight years old, his parents took him to see Annie Get Your Gun, starring Ethel Merman, and on a subsequent outing, McNally saw Gertrude Lawrence in The King and I. McNally later said: \\"When I saw On the Town, with Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly and Jules Munshin with the Staten Island Ferry and the Empire State Building, I said: 'That's where I want to live.' I've never regretted it.\\" In high school McNally was encouraged to write by a gifted English teacher, Maurine McElroy (1913–2005). He enrolled at Columbia College in 1956. There he especially enjoyed Andrew Chiappe's two-semester course on Shakespeare in which students read Shakespeare's plays in roughly the order of their composition. He joined the Boar's Head Society and wrote Columbia's annual Varsity Show, which featured music by fellow student Edward L. Kleban and directed by Michael P. Kahn. He graduated in 1960 with a B.A. in English and membership in Phi Beta Kappa Society. In 1961, McNally was hired by novelist John Steinbeck to tutor his two teenage sons as the Steinbeck family took a cruise around the world. On the cruise McNally completed a draft of what became the opening act of And Things That Go Bump in the Night. Steinbeck asked McNally to write the libretto for a musical version of the novel East of Eden. Career =Early career= After graduation, McNally moved to Mexico to focus on his writing, completing a one-act play which he submitted to the Actors Studio in New York City for production. While the play was turned down by the acting school, the Studio was impressed with the script, and McNally was invited to serve as the Studio's stage manager so that he could gain practical knowledge of theater. His earliest full-length play, This Side of the Door, deals with a sensitive boy's battle of wills with his overbearing father and was produced in an Actor's Studio Workshop in 1962, featuring a young Estelle Parsons. Starting a career that covered both off- Broadway and Broadway, his plays cried out against Vietnam, satirized stale family dynamics, mocked sexual mores and became a part of the social protest movement of the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1964, his next play And Things That Go Bump in the Night put homosexuality squarely on stage which brought him the ire of New York City's conservative theatre critics. It opened at the Royale Theatre on Broadway to generally negative reviews. The play explores the psycho-social dynamic of anxiety that leads one to preemptively and defensively accuse others of creating problems that in actuality result from one's own insecurity. McNally later said, \\"My first play, Things That Go Bump in the Night, was a big flop. I had to begin all over again.\\" Nevertheless, the producer, Theodore Mann dropped the price of tickets to $1.00 which allowed the production to run with sold-out houses for three weeks. Next (1968), which brought him his greatest early acclaim and was directed by Elaine May and starred James Coco, follows a married, middle-aged, businessman who has been mistakenly drafted into the armed forces. Botticelli (1968) centers on two American soldiers standing guard in the jungle while making a game of the great names in Western Civilization. ¡Cuba Si! (1968) satirizes the disdain that many Americans feel for the idea of revolution though United Stats was itself born out of a revolution. It starred Melina Mercouri. In Where Has Tommy Flowers Gone? (1971) he celebrates while mourning the ineffectiveness of the American youth movement's conviction to \\"blow this country up so we can start all over again.\\" Sweet Eros (1968) is about a young man who professes his love to a naked woman he has gagged and bound to a chair. In Let It Bleed (1972) a young couple showers and becomes convinced an intruder is lurking on the other side of the shower curtain. These and his other early plays, including Tour (1967), Witness (1968), and Bringing It All Back Home (1970), and Whiskey (1973), form a dark satire on American moral complacency. McNally turned to comedy and farce, beginning with Noon (1968), a sexual farce revolving around five strangers who are lured to an apartment in lower Manhattan by a personal advertisement. Bad Habits, which satirizes American reliance upon psychotherapy, premiered at the John Drew Theatre in East Hampton, New York, in 1971 starring Linda Lavin. It transferred to the Booth Theatre on Broadway in 1974 and garnered an Obie Award. The Ritz is a farce centering on a straight man who inadvertently takes refuge in a Mafia- owned gay bathhouse. It opened at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C., and moved to the Longacre Theatre on Broadway in 1975. Robert Drivas, then McNally's romantic partner, directed both productions. McNally adapted the play for the motion picture, The Ritz (1976), directed by Richard Lester. In 1978, McNally wrote Broadway, Broadway, which failed in its Philadelphia try- out starring Geraldine Page. Rewritten and retitled It's Only a Play, it premiered in off-Broadway in 1985 at Manhattan Theatre Club directed by John Tillinger and starring Christine Baranski, Joanna Gleason, and James Coco. = Mid-career = After the failure of Broadway, Broadway and living briefly in Hollywood, he returned to New York City and formed an artistic relationship with Manhattan Theatre Club. The rapid spread of AIDS fundamentally changed his writing. McNally only became truly successful with works such as the off- Broadway production of Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune and its screen adaptation with stars Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer. His first Broadway musical was The Rink in 1984, a project he joined after the score by composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb had been written. In 1990, McNally won an Emmy Award for Best Writing in a Miniseries or Special for Andre's Mother, a drama about a woman coping with her son's death from AIDS. A year later, in Lips Together, Teeth Apart, two married couples spend the Fourth of July weekend at a summer house on Fire Island. They are all afraid to use the pool given that its owner who has just died of AIDS. It was written for Christine Baranski, Anthony Heald, Swoosie Kurtz (taking the place of Kathy Bates), and frequent McNally collaborator Nathan Lane, who had also starred in The Lisbon Traviata.\\"The Story\\" [ dramatists.com, accessed March 26, 2014 With Kiss of the Spider Woman (based on the novel by Manuel Puig) in 1992, McNally returned to the musical stage, collaborating with Kander and Ebb on a script which explores the complex relationship between two men jailed together in a Latin American prison. Kiss of the Spider Woman won the 1993 Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical, the first of McNally's four Tony Awards. He collaborated with Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens on Ragtime in 1997, a musical adaptation of the E. L. Doctorow novel, which tells the story of Coalhouse Walker Jr., a black musician who demands retribution when his Model T is destroyed by a mob of white troublemakers. The musical also features such historical figures as Harry Houdini, Booker T. Washington, J. P. Morgan, and Henry Ford. For his libretto, McNally won his third Tony Award. Ragtime finished its Broadway run on January 16, 2000. A revival in 2009 closed after only two months.\\"The Sondheim Review: Mutual admiration, Sondheim and playwright Terrence McNally began a collaboration in 1991, by Raymond-Jean Frontain readperiodicals.com, April 1, 2011 McNally's other plays from this period include 1994's Love!

In this retelling of the story of Jesus' birth, ministry, and death, he and his disciples are portrayed as homosexual. The play was initially canceled because of death threats against the board members of the Manhattan Theatre Club, which produced the play. The board relented after several other playwrights, including Athol Fugard, threatened to withdraw their plays if Corpus Christi was not produced. A crowd of almost 2,000 protested the play as blasphemous at its opening. After it opened in London in 1999, a group called the \\"Defenders of the Messenger Jesus\\" issued a fatwa sentencing McNally to death. In 2008, the play was revived in New York City at Rattlestick Playwrights Theatre. Reviewing this production for The New York Times, Jason Zinoman wrote that \\"without the noise of controversy, the play can finally be heard. Staged with admirable delicacy... the work seems more personal than political, a coming-of-age story wrapped in religious sentiment.\\" = Late career = In 2000, McNally partnered with composer and lyricist David Yazbek to write the musical The Full Monty, which was directed by Jack O’Brien and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell. It had an initial run at The Old Globe Theatre and then transferred to the Eugene O’Neill Theatre on Broadway. The opening night cast included Patrick Wilson, Andre De Shields, Jason Danieley, Kathleen Freeman, Emily Skinner, and Annie Golden. It was nominated for 12 Tony Awards including for McNally's book. It later transferred to the Prince of Wales Theater in London's West End. McNally collaborated on several new American operas. His voice may be more familiar with opera fans than theater-goers, as for nearly 30 years (1979-2008) he was a member of the Texaco Opera Quiz panel that fielded questions during the weekly Live from the Met radio broadcasts. He wrote the libretto for Dead Man Walking, his adaptation of Sister Helen Prejean's book, with a score by Jake Heggie. The opera had its world premiere at San Francisco Opera in 2000 and subsequently received two commercial recordings and over 40 productions worldwide, making it “one of the most successful American operas in recent decades.\\" In 2007, Heggie composed a chamber opera, Three Decembers, with a libretto by Gene Scheer based on a text McNally had created in 1999 for a Christmas concert to benefit Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, Some Christmas Letters (and a Couple of Phone Calls, Too). playbill.com In October 2015, Dallas Opera presented Great Scott with an original libretto by McNally and a score by Heggie. The new opera starred Joyce DiDonato and Frederica von Stade and was directed by Jack O’Brien. The Kennedy Center presented three of McNally's plays that focus on opera under the heading Nights at the Opera, in March 2010. It included a new play, Golden Age; Master Class, starring Tyne Daly; and The Lisbon Traviata, starring John Glover and Malcolm Gets.Hetrick, Adam. \\"Glover and Gets Open McNally's Lisbon Traviata in Washington, D.C.

The music is written by John Kander and the lyrics by Fred Ebb. Adapted from Friedrich Dürrenmatt’s 1956 satire, The Visit is the story of a widow who has amassed enormous sums of wealth and returns to her hometown to seek revenge on the villagers who scorned her in her youth. The project originally starred Angela Lansbury who departed the process to care for her ailing husband. Chita Rivera became the new star and The Visit had its first production at The Goodman Theater in Chicago in 2001. The first preview was held just ten days after the September 11 attacks, and the producers were unable to get many investors or critics from New York City to fly to Chicago. In 2004, Fred Ebb, the lyricist, died. Its next regional production occurred in 2008 at The Signature Theatre outside of Washington D.C. In 2014, under the direction of John Doyle and starring Chita Rivera and Roger Rees, The Visit had a new production at Williamstown Theatre and then transferred to Broadway at The Lyceum Theatre in 2015. The musical was nominated for five Tony awards including for McNally's book. Continuing his work on librettos, McNally partnered with his collaborators on Ragtime, Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, to write the musical A Man of No Importance which premiered at Lincoln Center in 2002 and was directed by Joe Mantello. He also wrote the libretto for Chita Rivera: The Dancer’s Life, in 2005, another collaboration with Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, which began at The Old Globe and subsequently transferred to Broadway at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre. In 2004, Primary Stages presented McNally’s The Stendhal Syndrome, which according to McNally explores “how art can affect us emotionally, psychologically, and erotically.” The play starred Isabella Rossellini and Richard Thomas and was directed by Leonard Foglia. In 2007, Philadelphia Theatre Company presented Some Men, which explores the evolution of gay relationships and same-sex marriage. It went on to Second Stage Theatre in New York and was directed by Trip Cullman. That same year McNally's drama Deuce ran on Broadway at the Music Box Theater for a limited engagement in 2007 for 121 performances. Directed by Michael Blakemore, the play starred Angela Lansbury, in her return to Broadway after more than 20 years, and Marian Seldes. And Away We Go premiered Off-Broadway at the Pearl Theatre in November 2013, with direction by Jack Cummings III and featured Donna Lynne Champlin, Sean McNall and Dominic Cuskern.Hetrick, Adam. \\"World Premiere of Terrence McNally's And Away We Go Opens Off-Broadway Nov. 24\\" playbill.com, November 24, 2013 The play takes place over several millennia covering the most pivotal moments in dramatic history entwined with a modern-day story of a struggling theatre company. McNally said that “It's very much written for the Pearl, the company that has kept the faith for the great classic plays. There are whole seasons in New York when I don't think a single classic play would have been performed if it hadn't been for the Pearl... I think it's really important. I write new plays for a living; I certainly don't think theatre should be just revivals, but there has always got to be a place for Chekhov, Ibsen, Shakespeare, Moliere and Aeschylus.” Mothers and Sons starring Tyne Daly and Frederick Weller opened on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre, where Master Class had its premiere, on March 24, 2014 (February 23, 2014 in previews).\\"The Verdict: Critics Review Terrence McNally's Mothers and Sons, Starring Tyne Daly\\" playbill.com, March 25, 2014 Mothers and Sons premiered at the Bucks County Playhouse (Pennsylvania) in June 2013.Gioia, Michael. \\"Tyne Daly and Frederick Weller Explore Relationships of Mothers and Sons, Beginning Feb. 23 On Broadway\\" playbill.com, February 23, 2014 Vermont Stage opened its production January 27, 2016 at FlynnSpace in Burlington, Vermont. The play is an expansion on his 1988 drama Andre’s Mother, which was set at a memorial service for a victim of the AIDS crisis. Mothers and Sons also marked the first time a legally wed gay couple was portrayed on Broadway. It was nominated for two Tony Awards including for Best Play. McNally's Fire and Air premiered Off-Broadway at Classic Stage Company on February 1, 2018. The play explores the history of the Ballets Russes, the Russian ballet company, with a particular focus on Sergei Diaghilev, the ballet impresario, and Vaslav Nijinsky, the dancer and choreographer. It featured the actors Douglas Hodge, Marsha Mason, Marin Mazzie, John Glover, and Jay Armstrong Johnson and was directed by Tony Award-winner John Doyle. On May 29, 2019, a revival of Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune opened on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre. The production starred Audra McDonald and Michael Shannon, and was directed by Arin Arbus in her Broadway debut. In June 2019, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, an event widely considered a watershed moment in the modern LGBTQ rights movement, Queerty named him one of the Pride50 \\"trailblazing individuals who actively ensure society remains moving towards equality, acceptance and dignity for all queer people\\". McNally received a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2019.  Personal life  In his early years in New York City, McNally's interest in theatre brought him to a party where, departing, he shared a cab with Edward Albee, who had recently written The Zoo Story and The Sandbox. They functioned as a couple for over four years during which Albee wrote The American Dream and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. He was frustrated by Albee's lack of openness about his sexuality. McNally later said: \\"I became invisible when press was around or at an opening night. I knew it was wrong. It’s so much work to live that way.\\" After his relationship with Albee, McNally entered into a long-term relationship with the actor and director Robert Drivas. Drivas and McNally broke up as a couple in 1976; they remained close friends until Drivas died of AIDS-related complications ten years later. McNally was partnered to Tom Kirdahy, a Broadway producer and a former civil rights attorney for not-for- profit AIDS organizations, following a civil union ceremony in Vermont on December 20, 2003. They married in Washington, D.C. on April 6, 2010. In celebration of the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states, they renewed their vows at New York City Hall with Mayor Bill de Blasio, Kirdahy's college roommate, officiating on June 26, 2015. When given his Tony for Lifetime Achievement in June 2019, he began his acceptance speech saying \\"Lifetime achievement. Not a moment too soon.\\" He wore a cannula and appeared short of breath. McNally died at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Florida, on March 24, 2020, at the age of 81, from complications of coronavirus disease 2019 during the COVID-19 pandemic. He had previously overcome lung cancer in the late 1990s that cost him both portions of his lungs due to the disease, and he was living with COPD at the time of his death. On theater For McNally, the most important function of theatre was to create community and bridge rifts opened between people by differences in religion, race, gender, and particularly sexual orientation. In an address to members of the League of American Theatres and Producers he remarked, \\"I think theatre teaches us who we are, what our society is, where we are going. I don't think theatre can solve the problems of a society, nor should it be expected to ... plays don't do that. People do. [But plays can] provide a forum for the ideas and feelings that can lead a society to decide to heal and change itself.\\"  Archive  McNally donated his papers covering the years from the 1950s to 2002 to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin in a series of gifts between 1999 and 2003. The archive includes all of his major works for stage, screen, and television, as well as correspondence, posters, production photographs, programs, reviews, awards, speeches, and recordings. It is an open archive. He had previously deposited his papers at the University of Michigan. His high school English teacher, Maurine McElroy, who had since become head of freshman English at the University of Texas, influenced his choice of Texas.  Documentary  Terrence McNally: Every Act of Life, a documentary about McNally's life and career, aired on PBS on June 14, 2019, as part of their American Masters series. The film features new interviews with McNally in addition to conversations with his friends and collaborators, including F. Murray Abraham, Christine Baranski, Tyne Daly, Edie Falco, John Kander, Nathan Lane, Angela Lansbury, Marin Mazzie, Audra McDonald, Rita Moreno, Billy Porter, Chita Rivera, Doris Roberts, John Slattery and Patrick Wilson, plus the voices of Dan Bucatinsky, Bryan Cranston and Meryl Streep. Charles McNulty, reviewing the film for the Los Angeles Times, wrote, \\"If you can know a person by the company he keeps, you can judge a playwright by the talent that sticks by him. By this measure, Terrence McNally was one of the most important dramatists of the last 50 years.\\" Writing credits Plays: * And Things That Go Bump in the Night (1964) * Botticelli (1968) * Sweet Eros (1968) * Witness (1968) * ¡Cuba Si!

A 16th-century manor house in origin, it is located near the village of Ellesborough, halfway between Princes Risborough and Wendover in Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom, at the foot of the Chiltern Hills. It is about north-west of central London. Coombe Hill, once part of the estate, is located northeast. Chequers has been the country home of the serving Prime Minister since 1921 after the estate was gifted to the nation by Sir Arthur Lee by a Deed of Settlement, given full effect in the Chequers Estate Act 1917. The house is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England. Origin of the name The name \\"Chequers\\" may derive from an early owner of the manor of Ellesborough in the 12th century, Elias Ostiarius (or de Scaccario). The name \\"Ostiarius\\" meant an usher of the Court of the Exchequer and scacchiera means a chessboard in Italian. Elias Ostiarius' coat of arms included the chequer board of the Exchequer, so the estate may be named after his arms and position at court. The house passed through generations of the Scaccario family (spelt many different ways) until it passed into the D'Awtrey family, whose name was eventually anglicised to Hawtrey. Alternatively, the house could have been named after the chequer trees (Sorbus torminalis) that grow in its grounds.M. W. Fletcher, Storm is Coming (London: Andrews, 2016), p. 92 There is a reference to this in the book Elizabeth: Apprenticeship by David Starkey, which describes the early life of Elizabeth I. History William Hawtrey built the current mansion around 1565, and it may have involved the reconstruction of an earlier building. A reception room in the house bears his name today. Soon after its construction, Hawtrey acted as a custodian at Chequers for Lady Mary Grey, younger sister of Lady Jane Grey and great-granddaughter of King Henry VII. Lady Mary had married without the monarch's consent and was banished from court by Queen Elizabeth I and kept confined as punishment.. Lady Mary remained at Chequers for two years. The room where she slept from 1565 to 1567 remains in its original condition. Through descent in the female line and marriages, the house passed through several families: the Wooleys, the Crokes and the Thurbanes. In 1715, the then owner of the house married John Russell, a grandson of Oliver Cromwell. The house is known for this connection to the Cromwells, and still contains a large collection of Cromwell memorabilia. In the 19th century, the Russells (by now the Greenhill-Russell family) employed Henry Rhodes to make alterations to the house in the Gothic style. The Tudor panelling and windows were ripped out and battlements with pinnacles installed. Towards the end of the 19th century, the house passed through marriage to the Astley family. In 1892–1901, Bertram Astley restored the house to its Elizabethan origins, with advice from Sir Reginald Blomfield. =20th century= In 1909, the house was taken on a long lease by Arthur Lee and his wife Ruth (an American heiress). Lee immediately re-engaged Blomfield to undertake a restoration of the interior. At the same time, Henry Avray Tipping undertook the design of several walled gardens from 1911 to 1912. In 1912, after the death of the last of the house's ancestral owners Henry Delavel Astley, Ruth Lee and her sister purchased the property and later gave it to Arthur Lee. During the First World War, the house became a hospital and then a convalescent home for officers. After the war, Chequers became a private home again (now furnished with many 16th century antiques and tapestries and the Cromwellian antiquities), and the childless Lees formed a plan. While previous Prime Ministers had always belonged to the landed classes, the post-First World War era was bringing in a new breed of politician. These men did not have the spacious country houses of previous prime ministers in which to entertain foreign dignitaries or a tranquil place to relax from the affairs of state. After long discussions with then Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Chequers was given to the nation as a country retreat for the serving Prime Minister under the Chequers Estate Act 1917. The Lees, by this time Lord and Lady Lee of Fareham, left Chequers on 8 January 1921 after a final dinner at the house. A political disagreement between the Lees and Lloyd George soured the handover, which went ahead nonetheless. A stained glass window in the long gallery of the house commissioned by Lord and Lady Lee of Fareham bears the inscription: > This house of peace and ancient memories was given to England as a thank- > offering for her deliverance in the great war of 1914–1918 as a place of > rest and recreation for her Prime Ministers for ever. The property houses one of the largest collections of art and memorabilia pertaining to Oliver Cromwell in the country. It also houses many other national antiques and books, held in the famous \\"long room\\", including a diary of Admiral Lord Nelson. However, the collection is not open to the public. Nearby Coombe Hill was part of the estate until the 1920s when it was given to the National Trust. Coombe Hill and the Chequers Estate are part of the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, designated in 1965. The landscaped park, woodlands and formal gardens surrounding Chequers are listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. During the early part of the Second World War, it was considered that security at Chequers was inadequate to protect the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. Therefore he used Ditchley in Oxfordshire until late 1942, by which time the approach road, clearly visible from the sky, had been camouflaged and other security measures had been put in place.Winston Churchill History Lives at Ditchley and Bletchley – The Churchill Centre Chequers under Neville Chamberlain had one telephone – in the kitchen; but Churchill \\"at once installed a whole battery on his desk and had them in constant use\\", according to Marshal of the Royal Air Force The 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, who served as Chief of the Air Staff during the Second World War. =21st century= On 1 June 2007, the Chequers estate was designated as a protected site under Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. This specifically criminalised trespass into the estate. In July 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May held a Cabinet meeting at Chequers to agree on the UK's approach to Brexit which became known as the proposed \\"Chequers plan\\".BBC News https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44749993 In April 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson chose to recover at Chequers after being hospitalised at St Thomas's, London, with respiratory complications from COVID-19 which included a three-night stay in ICU.  Chequers as a gift  Sir Arthur Lee donated the Chequers estate after discussions with the then Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Lee noted a new type of politician was emerging, one without large country homes to retreat to and entertain foreign dignitaries. The Chequers Estate Act 1917 contains his reasoning and thoughts for the gift: Location Downing Street and Chequers are about apart. The Ridgeway National Trail crosses the private drive.

The members formed \\"The Zombies\\", which was advertised as a \\"copy band\\" singing L'Arc-en-Ciel's songs. They also covered Marilyn Manson's \\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem\\". The return from the break was marked by a concert entitled \\"Reincarnation 97 Live in Tokyo Dome\\". During the concert, they also revealed their new drummer yukihiro, the former drummer of the groups Zi:Kill and Die in Cries. This concert was also the group's first performance at the Tokyo Dome and had an attendance of 56,000 people, with the tickets sold out in a record-breaking four minutes.

This was followed by the group's album, Smile, on March 31. Shortly after, on June 2, the single \\"Jiyuu e no Shoutai\\" was the first to feature a song by P'unk-en-Ciel. On July 31, 2004, L'Arc-en-Ciel made their North American debut at the anime convention Otakon. Approximately 12,000 people attended the concert, which was held at the 1st Mariner Arena. They were the first Japanese band to perform at the arena. On May 31, 2005, Tofu Records, Sony Music Japan's U.S. label, released a DVD of their 2004 Otakon concert. On June 25, 2007, L'Arc-en-Ciel signed a record deal with HMV America. =2005–2006: Asian tour and solo projects= In 2005, the band released various singles, including \\"Killing Me\\", \\"New World\\" and \\"Jojoushi\\". These were later complied onto the album Awake, which was released on June 22, 2005. It features twelve tracks, including \\"Lost Heaven\\", the ending theme song of Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: Conqueror of Shamballa. Another of the band's single, \\"Link\\", was released on July 20, 2005. This song was also featured in the movie as the opening theme song, and was included on their next album, entitled Kiss. In August 2005, the band went on a nationwide tour for their album Awake. It was followed by another tour titled Asia Live 2005, which had the band performing in Seoul and Shanghai and ended at the Tokyo Dome. Following these two tours, L'Arc-en-Ciel's members turned their attention back to their own solo projects. tetsuya began recording with, veteran metal vocalist of Dead End, Morrie for his solo project Creature Creature. yukihiro regrouped his band Acid Android and released the single \\"Let's Dance\\" on April 5, 2006. Acid Android joined Mucc to perform two concerts in Shanghai in April 2006. hyde composed \\"Glamorous Sky\\", the theme song of the film adaption of the manga Nana. The song was sung by pop singer Mika Nakashima, the first time hyde composed music for another vocalist. In addition, his own solo album, Faith, was released on April 26, 2006. hyde also went on a five-month tour throughout Japan to publicize his album. After signing with Tofu Records, he held four small concerts in the United States in July 2006, making his US debut. This was the first of L'Arc-en-Ciel's solo projects to be held outside Japan. On August 23, 2006, ken released a solo single entitled \\"Speed\\". =2006–2008: 15th Anniversary and Europe concert debut= On November 25 and 26, 2006, L'Arc-en-Ciel played two shows at the Tokyo Dome to celebrate their 15th anniversary. The tickets for these concerts were sold out in two minutes, breaking the previous record, which was also set by them. A poll was created on their official website, during the weeks before the concert, which allowed fans to pick the songs they would like to hear at the show. The concert was later broadcast on the WOWOW channel on December 23, 2006, and was subsequently broadcast on Korean MTV on February 8, 2007. L'Arc-en-Ciel recorded the song \\"Shine\\", which was to be used as the opening song for the NHK anime Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit. In the spring of 2007, the group kicked off their Mata Heart ni hi wo Tsukero 2007 tour in Japan. They also released the single \\"Seventh Heaven\\" on May 30, 2007, which topped the Oricon charts. Their song \\"My Heart Draws a Dream\\", which was used in a Subaru commercial, was also released as a single on August 29, 2007. This single also topped the Oricon charts. L'Arc-en-Ciel subsequently recorded the song \\"Daybreak's Bell\\", which was used as the first opening theme for the anime Mobile Suit Gundam 00. This song was released as a single on October 10, 2007, later topping the Oricon weekly charts. From November 14 to December 25, 2007, they released a limited edition single titled \\"Hurry Xmas\\", along with two new DVDs, titled 15th L'Anniversary Live and Chronicle 3. Their studio album Kiss was released on November 21, 2007, and debuted at number one on the Oricon charts. L'Arc-en-Ciel then performed the Theater of Kiss tour, which was held from December 22, 2007, to February 17, 2008. The song \\"Drink It Down\\" was used as the Japanese opening song for the PS3/Xbox 360 game Devil May Cry 4. It was released as a single on April 2, 2008, and topped the Oricon weekly charts. The band went on a tour, entitled Tour 2008 L'7: Trans Asia via Paris, which covered several major Asian cities, as well as Paris, France. On this tour, a live show hiatus until 2011 was announced, although new material would still continue to be released. Their double A-side single \\"Nexus 4/Shine\\" and the DVD Tour 2007-2008 Theater of Kiss were released together on August 27, 2008. =2009–2010: Live show hiatus= On May 20, 2009, L'Arc-en-Ciel released the DVD of their live concert in Paris, titled Live in Paris. hyde and K.A.Z formed the hard rock group Vamps and released their self-titled first album, Vamps, on June 10, 2009. On December 1, 2009, L'Arc-en-Ciel announced the release of a new single named \\"Bless\\" on January 27, 2010. This was used as the theme song for NHK's broadcast of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Also, tetsu announced that he had changed his stage name to \\"tetsuya\\" and released his first artist book. The book, which ranked number six amongst the Talent Book Charts, featured early live pictures and a 30,000 character interview with the bassist. On March 10, 2010, L'Arc-en-Ciel released their fifth \\"best of\\" album, entitled Quadrinity: Member's Best Selections. It contains 4 CDs with 7 tracks per band member, chosen and remastered by each of them. The first press edition of this compilation also came with a DVD that includes a variety quiz show with the band titled The L'Arquiz. =2011–2013: 20th Anniversary and world tour= On January 1, 2011, L'Arc-en-Ciel celebrated both their 20th anniversary and the New Year with the midnight concert L'A Happy New Year! at Makuhari Messe. On February 16, 2011, they released the compilation album Twenity. This album consists of three parts: Twenity 1991-1996, Twenity 1997-1999, and Twenity 2000-2010. A box set entitled Twenity Box was later released on March 9, 2011. The albums are an all-around \\"best of\\" collection of the band, covering everything from the formation of the group, including their hit singles till to their newest works. Twenity 1991-1996 covers their work from their album Dune until their album True. Twenity 1997-1999 covers the releases from their single \\"Niji\\" to the single \\"Love Flies\\". Twenity 2000-2010 covers their releases from the double A-side \\"Neo Universe/Finale\\" up to their commercial-only song from 2010, a cover of \\"I Love Rock 'n Roll\\". The Twenity Box released on March 9 contains all three of the albums. It also came with a special digest DVD that covered the 20-year history of the band, a deluxe booklet, and a special music box that contained either \\"Flower\\", \\"Anata\\", \\"New World\\", or \\"My Heart Draws a Dream\\" at random. Later, it was announced that L'Arc-en-Ciel would provide the theme song for Fullmetal Alchemist the Movie: The Sacred Star of Milos, entitled \\"Good Luck My Way\\". This is their fourth contribution to the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise. The song was released as their first 20th L'Anniversary single on June 29, 2011. To further celebrate their 20 years together, L'Arc-en-Ciel put on a \\"20th L'Anniversary Concert\\" at Ajinomoto Stadium in Tokyo on May 28–29, 2011, with each day dedicated to one half of their career. All of the proceeds from the concerts were donated to the Great East Japan earthquake relief efforts. Additionally, at the end of the concert, it was announced that there would be a L'Anniversary Japan Tour in 2011, as well as a world tour in 2012. On October 12, the second 20th L'Anniversary single was released, entitled \\"XXX\\" (Kiss Kiss Kiss). L'Arc-en-Ciel was subsequently approached by the producers of the Wild 7 live-action film to perform the movie's theme song. Entitled \\"Chase\\", the song was released as the group's third L'Anniversary single on December 21, 2011. L'Arc-en-Ciel then announced that they would be releasing their twelfth studio album, and gave fans who bought \\"Chase\\" a sneak peek with a live internet broadcast of the band mastering the album on December 26 on Ustream. They also announced that their alter ego band P'unk-en-Ciel would be releasing their first album, titled P'unk is Not Dead, the same day. The band's twelfth album, Butterfly, was released on February 8, 2012. It includes all their singles from the single \\"Drink it Down\\" onwards and four new songs. The band's 2012 world tour took them to Hong Kong on March 3, Bangkok on March 7, Shanghai on March 10, Taipei on March 17, New York on March 25, London on April 11, Paris on April 14, Singapore on April 28, Jakarta on May 2, Seoul on May 5, Yokohama on May 12–13, Osaka on May 19–20, Tokyo on May 26–27, and Honolulu on May 31. Their show in New York was originally scheduled to be at The Theater at Madison Square Garden on March 23, but was later moved to the main arena. Making L'Arc-en-Ciel the first Japanese artist to be the lead act at the legendary venue. They ended the tour by returning to the US for two nights in Honolulu, Hawaii on May 31 and June 1, the latter being for the group's fan club members only. At the first day, the mayor of Honolulu Peter Carlisle made a surprise appearance and declared May 31 \\"L’Arc~en~Ciel Day\\", saying he felt the band \\"made a great contribution to cultural activities, and built a bridge of friendship between Hawaii and Japan\\". =2014–2016: Return to the National Stadium and L'ArCasino= On March 21 and 22, the band played a two-day concert at the iconic National Stadium in Tokyo, where they also played and announced the future release of their new single \\"Everlasting\\".http://okmusic.jp/#!/news/34580 In June 2015, the band announced a two-day concert under the name of L'ArCasino, held on Umeshima Outdoor Special Stage, Osaka, on September 21 and 22. As they did with the previous live performances in Tokyo, they played a single for a Christmas release, \\"Wing's Flap\\". In December 2016, the single \\"Don't be Afraid\\" was released. The song was used as the main theme song for the film Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, and the video game Resident Evil 7. To promote their release, the band recorded a VR music video for the PlayStation 4, which features the band members fighting zombies in a location of Racoon City. The music video is available on the PlayStation Store in Japan. =2017–2019: 25th Anniversary & L'ArChristmas= L'Arc-en-Ciel celebrated their 25th anniversary with two shows (April 9 and 10) at Tokyo Dome. Only 110,000 seats were available for the almost 600,000 fans who signed up for the ticket lotteries. In December 2018, L'Arc~en~Ciel's first Christmas live was held at Tokyo Dome. The stage theme is about Ice Kingdom with a Frozen Christmas tree in the center of the stage. In late 2019 the band reinforced their presence in social media, opening an official account on Instagram, as well as an official channel in YouTube. They also released most of their music albums across different music streaming services, including Apple Music and Spotify. =2020: MMXX Arena Tour= The band started the year with a new arena tour, the first one in 8 years. A total of 12 live shows will be held across five cities between January and March, starting with their home town at the Osaka-jō Hall. P'unk-en-Ciel P'unk-en-Ciel (stylized as P'UNK~EN~CIEL) is an alter ego of L'Arc-en-Ciel. Introduced in 2004, hyde takes over the guitar, ken the drums, yukihiro plays the bass, while tetsuya performs the vocals. P'unk-en-Ciel's songs have a more punk sound and their music is usually heavier and faster with a different tone due to tetsuya's vocals. hyde wears a pirate patch over his left eye in P'unk-en-Ciel performances. yukihiro is known to wear a gas mask; however, this has only been seen once at a live concert during their Smile tour in 2004. Each member is called in capital letters; T.E.Z P'UNK (formerly TETSU P'UNK), KEN P'UNK, HYDE P'UNK and YUKI P'UNK. Each member produces one song of their choice, and they alternate their productions. P'unk-en-Ciel is the re-visitation of D'ark-en-Ciel (stylized as D'ARK~EN~CIEL), a special event that took place during concerts in the years when sakura was their drummer. The only material released from D'ark-en-Ciel is the 18-minute self-titled B-side found on the (then) unreleased \\"The Fourth Avenue Cafe\\" single. Each member was called; DARK TETSU, HYDE DARK, Suck・D'ark・La and Kën D'Ark. P'unk-en-Ciel songs have been recorded and used as B-sides on singles since 2004 and their performances can be found on live DVDs. They also featured television personality Sayaka Aoki (called P'UNK ) in the song \\"Round and Round 2005\\". On February 8, 2012 P'unk-en-Ciel released their first album P'unk is Not Dead, which contains all twelve songs they released up to that point. =P'unk-en-Ciel songs= Recorded versions released on singles: * \\"Milky Way\\", found on the \\"Jiyuu e no Shoutai\\" single (Produced by HYDE P'UNK). * \\"Round and Round 2005\\", found on the \\"Killing Me\\" single (Produced by KEN P'UNK). * \\"Kasou Heisei 17 Nen\\", found on the \\"New World\\" single (Produced by HYDE P'UNK). * \\"Heaven's Drive 2005\\", found on the \\"Jojoushi\\" single (Produced by YUKI P'UNK). * \\"Promised land 2005\\", found on the \\"Link\\" single (Produced by TETSU P'UNK). * \\"Honey 2007\\", found on the \\"Seventh Heaven\\" single (Produced by KEN P'UNK). * \\"Feeling Fine 2007\\", found on the \\"My Heart Draws a Dream\\" single (Produced by YUKI P'UNK). * \\"Natsu no Yuu-utsu [Sea in Blood 2007]\\", found on the \\"Daybreak's Bell\\" single (Produced by HYDE P'UNK). * \\"I Wish 2007\\", found on the \\"Hurry Xmas\\" single (Produced by TETSU P'UNK - it also has a PV). * \\"Dune 2008\\", found on the \\"Drink It Down\\" single (Produced by KEN P'UNK). * \\"Route 666 -2010-\\", found on the \\"Bless\\" single (Produced by YUKI P'UNK). * \\"Metropolis -2011-\\", found on the \\"Good Luck My Way\\" single (Produced by T.E.Z P'UNK).

It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because of its wide distribution. It is threatened by hunting for its meat and for the international pet trade. This nonvenomous constrictor is the smallest of the African pythons, growing to a maximum length of . The name \\"ball python\\" refers to its tendency to curl into a ball when stressed or frightened.  Taxonomy  Boa regia was the scientific name proposed by George Shaw in 1802 for a pale variegated python from an indistinct place in Africa. The generic name Python was proposed by François Marie Daudin in 1803 for non-venomous flecked snakes. Between 1830 and 1849, several generic names were proposed for the same zoological specimen described by Shaw, including Enygrus by Johann Georg Wagler, Cenchris and Hertulia by John Edward Gray. Gray also described four specimens that were collected in Gambia and were preserved in spirits and fluid. Description Close-up of head The ball python is black or dark brown with light brown blotches on the back and sides. Its white or cream belly is scattered with black markings. It is a stocky snake with a relatively small head and smooth scales. It reaches a maximum adult length of . Males typically measure eight to ten subcaudal scales, and females typically measure two to four subcaudal scales. Females reach an average snout-to-vent length of , a long jaw, an long tail and a maximum weight of . Males are smaller with an average snout-to-vent length of , a long jaw, an long tail and a maximum weight of . Both sexes have pelvic spurs on both sides of the vent. During copulation, males use these spurs for gripping females. Males tend to have larger spurs, and sex is best determined by manual eversion of the male hemipenes or inserting a probe into the cloaca to check the presence of an inverted hemipenis. Distribution and habitat The ball python is native to west Sub Saharan Africa from Senegal, Mali, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Benin, and Nigeria through Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic to Sudan and Uganda. It prefers grasslands, savannas, and sparsely wooded areas. Behavior and ecology This terrestrial species is known for its defense strategy that involves coiling into a tight ball when threatened, with its head and neck tucked away in the middle. In this state, it can literally be rolled around. Favored retreats include mammal burrows and other underground hiding places, where they also aestivate. In captivity, they are considered good pets, with their relatively small size and placid nature making them easy to handle. Males tend to display more semi- arboreal behaviours, whilst females tend towards terrestrial behaviours. =Diet= The diet of the ball python in the wild consists mostly of small mammals such as Natal multimammate mouse, shrews, gerbils, and striped mice, and birds. Young pythons less than total length and males prey almost exclusively on small bird nestlings and immature young. Pythons greater than 70 cm total length and females prey almost exclusively on small mammals. =Reproduction= Ball python eggs incubating Females are oviparous and lay three to 11 rather large, leathery eggs. They incubate them underground with a shivering motion. They hatch after 55 to 60 days. Young male pythons reach sexual maturity at 11–18 months, and females at 20–36 months. Age is only one factor in determining sexual maturity and the ability to breed; weight is the second factor. Males breed at or more, but in captivity are often not bred until they are , although in captivity, some males have been known to begin breeding at . Females breed in the wild at weights as low as though or more in weight is most common; in captivity, breeders generally wait until they are no less than . Parental care of the eggs ends once they hatch, and the female leaves the offspring to fend for themselves. In captivity albino ball python A ball python in the Bronx Zoo Python breeders have developed many morphs with altered colors and patterns.(P. regius) Base Mutations at Graziani Reptiles. Accessed 12 September 2007. Wild-caught specimens have greater difficulty adapting to a captive environment, which can result in refusal to feed, and they generally carry internal or external parasites. Specimens have survived for up to 60 years in captivity, with the oldest recorded ball python being kept in captivity 62 years, 59 of those at the Saint Louis Zoo. Although the popularity of python breeding has led to more captive-bred ball python pets, it is often cheaper to import them from the wild, and tens of thousands are exported from West Africa each year. The conservational impact on the native population is not well documented. Most captive ball pythons accept common rats and mice, and some eat birds, such as chicken and quail. Some keepers feed their ball pythons multimammate mice, which ball pythons would naturally feed on in the wild. Feeder animals are typically sold frozen and thawed by owners to feed to their pythons. Another option for feeding ball pythons is with live food, where the prey is purchased alive and is either killed by the owner and immediately offered to the snake, or set loose and allowed to be 'hunted' by the snake. Live feeding is rarely used in some areas, such as the United Kingdom, where, while not expressly prohibited, is considered a legal gray area due to animal welfare laws which prohibit the suffering of vertebrates. It is generally not recommended to allow the snake to 'hunt' its food as the prey's defensive instinct can cause the prey to fight back, causing injury, and even death to the snake. Younger ball pythons may eat as often as every 5 days, but as they mature, ball pythons tend to wait longer between meals, ranging from 7–14 days as adults. A ball python will typically not eat when it is shedding. =Breeding= Ball pythons are one of the most common reptiles bred in captivity. They usually are able to produce a clutch of six eggs on average, but clutch sizes also range from one to eleven. Ball pythons reach sexual maturity at the age of two to two and a half years and a weight of 1500 grams. These snakes usually lay one clutch per year and the eggs hatch around sixty days later. Usually, these eggs are artificially incubated in a captive environment at temperatures between 88–90 degrees Fahrenheit. Some captive breeders use ultra-sounding technology to verify the progress of reproductive development. This can help to increase the chances of successful fertilization as the ultra-sound can help predict the best times to introduce males and females during the breeding season. In captivity, ball pythons are often bred for specific patterns, or morphs. While most of them are solely cosmetic, some have come under controversy due to inherited physical or cognitive defects associated with the inherited pattern. It has been shown that the spider morph gene is connected with major neurological issues, specifically related to the snake's sense of balance. The International Herpetological Society banned the sale of such morphs at their events. Captive ball pythons are available in hundreds of different color patterns. Some of the most common are pastel, albino, mojave, lesser, and axanthic. Breeders are continuously creating new designer morphs, and over 6,500 different morphs currently exist. = General husbandry = While ball pythons can make excellent pets for those unfamiliar with keeping snakes as a pet, ball pythons still require specialized care and attention. Over the course of their life, a ball python requires a number of different sizes of enclosure in order to meet its needs as it grows; their enclosures can consist of designated reptile terrariums, plastic tubs, or aquarium tanks. Ball pythons can be adept at escaping from their enclosures, meaning that their habitat should be kept secure so as to prevent escape. The snake's enclosure should be kept well-ventilated, and it is recommended that the snake be able to stretch out fully within its enclosure without having to bend or curl up to fit; many keepers recommend a 30–50-gallon tank for an adult ball python. It is also recommended that ball pythons have some form of enrichment in their enclosure, generally defined as something that allows the snake to exhibit behaviors they would naturally display in the wild, such as exploration. This can be something as simple such as fake leaves and/or a cardboard roll, or a more extensive form of enrichment, such as live plants and sculpted backgrounds that allow the snake to climb. Enrichment is considered important, as captivity generally does not provide the same level of activity or positive stimulation as a ball python's natural habitat, and so must be added in by the keeper. Enrichment is generally thought to improve a captive snake's general health and wellbeing. In the wild, ball pythons are naturally found in tropical areas with relatively high temperatures, and as such, should be kept in a thermoregulated enclosure. Because snakes rely on their environment for thermoregulation, there should be a range of temperatures throughout the enclosure; this is best achieved with a heat mat placed underneath the enclosure, monitored with a thermostat. It is recommended that one side of the snake's enclosure stay at roughly , with the other measuring at roughly , mimicking shade and direct sunlight and allowing the snake to thermoregulate between the two. Like most snakes, ball pythons benefit from a 'hide' or a small cave, allowing them to the ability to retreat from the 'open ground' of their enclosure; this may simply be an upturned plastic bowl with a small entryway cut into it. It is recommended that ball pythons have a 'hide' on both the hot and cool sides of the temperature gradient so that they don't have to choose between a comfortable temperature and a safe, dark place, as they are nocturnal and prefer to sleep in the day. The humidity of a ball python's enclosure is also important and is recommended to be kept around 50–60%. This mimics the natural environment of the ball python. During shed, the humidity should be raised to 80% to assist the snake in shedding, allowing them to remove their skin entirely on their own. A ball python's enclosure is usually filled with a small layer of substrate – an earth-like substance allowing the snake to move easily through friction with the substrate itself, and also assisting in shedding by giving the snake something to rub against to help loosen dead skin. Substrate can consist of coconut husk and mulch, though paper towels and newspapers are also used; substrate choices must be considered as the type of substrate chosen for a ball python's environment will have an effect on the humidity of the enclosure. Bioactive enclosures imitate a natural environment and are becoming increasingly popular with ball python keepers. Bioactive enclosures rely on the inclusion of elements such as live plants, leaf litter, moss, and 'custodians' in the form of springtails and isopods such as tropical woodlice to mimic an ecosystem in the enclosure. The 'custodians' live in the substrate – typically a mixture of coconut husk and natural soil – and help to break down waste produced by the snake, including shed skin, which can help with cleanliness and upkeep. In culture The ball python is particularly revered by the Igbo people in southeastern Nigeria, who consider it symbolic of the earth, being an animal that travels so close to the ground. Even Christian Igbos treat ball pythons with great care whenever they come across one in a village or on someone's property; they either let them roam or pick them up gently and return them to a forest or field away from houses. If one is accidentally killed, many communities on Igbo land still build a coffin for the snake's remains and give it a short funeral. In northwestern Ghana, there is a taboo towards pythons as people consider them a savior and can not hurt or eat them. According to folklore a python once helped them flee from their enemies by transforming into a log to allow them to cross a river.

For unknown reasons, McCreight left Australia in 1859 and sailed first to San Francisco, and then to Victoria, British Columbia. Life and career in British Columbia At the time of McCreight's arrival in Victoria in 1860, it was the capital of the Colony of Vancouver Island, which at the time was governed by the powerful and autocratic Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, Sir James Douglas. In 1862, McCreight was called to the British Columbia bar and opened a practice in Victoria. By all accounts, he led a quiet and solitary life in the city, his main occupations outside of his work being his involvement in the local Masonic Lodge and as an active layperson in the congregation of the local Anglican cathedral. By 1866, the colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia had merged. Although the united colony did not join the Canadian confederation when it was effected in 1867, the worrisome economic and strategic situation soon made such an arrangement attractive. British Columbia joined confederation on July 20, 1871, and McCreight joined the interim transitional cabinet as Attorney General. During the first provincial general election that October, McCreight won a seat for Victoria City in the legislature, and Sir Joseph Trutch, the Lieutenant Governor, chose him to be British Columbia's first premier. He continued to hold the attorney-generalship as well. By all accounts, McCreight was temperamentally ill-suited to public life. His colleague, Henry Pering Pellew Crease, described the Premier as \\"bad tempered and queer...by fits & turns extremely credulous & extremely suspicious...excessively obstinate in the wrong places...close and reserved in his daily life...[and] utterly ignorant of politics\\".Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online at www.biographi.ca Nonetheless, McCreight's administration was a productive one, passing three dozen pieces of legislation in less than a year. His inability to form alliances and mollify the sometimes narrow and sectional interests of MLAs led to a loss of support, however, and in 1872, he resigned after losing a motion of no confidence following the Speech from the Throne. McCreight Lake, north west of Campbell River, British Columbia is named for him. Supreme Court Justice and retirement McCreight remained in the legislature until 1875, after which he returned to his law practice as a Queen's Counsel. Five years later, he was made a justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. In that capacity, he served in the Cariboo, Victoria, and finally in 1883 New Westminster before retiring in 1897, at the age of 70. McCreight returned to the United Kingdom, dying at Hastings, East Sussex at the age of 86.

During the 1970s, he was a media darling in Spain. Carrasco was crowned European Lightweight champion in 1967. This triumph was followed four years later, in 1971, with a victory over Mando Ramos in Madrid by disqualification in 11 rounds for the WBC's world Lightweight title. The victory was marred by controversy because Carrasco won the title while lying on the canvas: he had been hit in the head by Ramos. The fight's referee expressed confusion as to whether the blow was legal, but he decided to call it an illegal blow and raised Carrasco's hand in signal of victory. Carrasco immediately became a national hero in Spain, as Spain's second-ever world boxing champion.1971-11-05 : Mando Ramos 135 lbs lost to Pedro Carrasco 134¾ lbs by DQ in round 12 of 15. boxrec.com Carrasco, who was a culturally educated fighter, became a sensation with the media, especially with tabloid magazines, and he started to be seen with Spanish show business stars. His picture appeared on the covers of such magazines as ¡Hola! many times. He married the singer Rocío Jurado, with whom he had a daughter, Rocío Carrasco. He was also married to Raquel Mosquera for five years. In 1971, and because of the controversial nature of his world championship win over Ramos, the WBC ordered a rematch, and it was fought in Los Angeles. There, the fight was a controversy again because Carrasco was clearly the winner but the decision was favorable to Ramos and retook title. They had another rematch, and Ramos beat Carrasco again. Carrasco's career boxing record was 106–3–2 (66 KOs). After beginning his career 12–1–1, Carrasco had a streak on which he went 92–0–1. The draw came after Carrasco had won 83 consecutive fights. This undefeated streak was longer than Julio César Chávez's (90–0–1). Chávez's streak, however, was from the beginning of the career, and he was 87–0 before the draw.

Along with Grant Wood and John Steuart Curry, he was at the forefront of the Regionalist art movement. The fluid, sculpted figures in his paintings showed everyday people in scenes of life in the United States. His work is strongly associated with the Midwestern United States, the region in which he was born and which he called home for most of his life. He also studied in Paris, lived in New York City for more than 20 years and painted scores of works there, summered for 50 years on Martha's Vineyard off the New England coast, and also painted scenes of the American South and West. Early life and education Benton was born in Neosho, Missouri, into an influential family of politicians. He had two younger sisters, Mary and Mildred, and a younger brother, Nathaniel. His mother was Elizabeth Wise Benton and his father, Colonel Maecenas Benton, was a lawyer and four times elected as U.S. congressman. Known as the \\"little giant of the Ozarks\\", Maecenas named his son after his own great-uncle, Thomas Hart Benton, one of the first two United States Senators elected from Missouri. Given his father's political career, Benton spent his childhood shuttling between Washington, D.C. and Missouri. His father sent him to Western Military Academy in 1905–06, hoping to shape him for a political career. Growing up in two different cultures, Benton rebelled against his father's plans. He wanted to develop his interest in art, which his mother supported. As a teenager, he worked as a cartoonist for the Joplin American newspaper, in Joplin, Missouri.Dictionary of Missouri Biography, Lawrence O. Christensen, University of Missouri Press, 1999, pg. 62 With his mother's encouragement, in 1907 Benton enrolled at The School of The Art Institute of Chicago. Two years later, he moved to Paris in 1909 to continue his art education at the Académie Julian. His mother supported him financially and emotionally to work at art until he married in his early 30s. His sister Mildred said, \\"My mother was a great power in his growing up.\\" In Paris, Benton met other North American artists, such as the Mexican Diego Rivera and Stanton Macdonald-Wright, an advocate of Synchromism. Influenced by the latter, Benton subsequently adopted a Synchromist style.. Early career and World War I Camouflage pattern of the British ship S.S. Alban as documented by Thomas Hart Benton After studying in Europe, Benton moved to New York City in 1912 and resumed painting. During World War I, he served in the U.S. Navy and was stationed at Norfolk, Virginia. His war-related work had an enduring effect on his style. He was directed to make drawings and illustrations of shipyard work and life, and this requirement for realistic documentation strongly affected his later style. Later in the war, classified as a \\"camoufleur\\", Benton drew the camouflaged ships that entered Norfolk harbor. His work was required for several reasons: to ensure that U.S. ship painters were correctly applying the camouflage schemes, to aid in identifying U.S. ships that might later be lost, and to have records of the ship camouflage of other Allied navies. Benton later said that his work for the Navy \\"was the most important thing, so far, I had ever done for myself as an artist.\\"An Artist in America, Thomas Hart Benton, University of Missouri Press, p. 44 People of Chilmark (Figure Composition), 1920, in the Hirshhorn Museum collection in Washington, D.C. Marriage and family At the age of 33, Benton married Rita Piacenza, an Italian immigrant, in 1922. They met while Benton was teaching art classes for a neighborhood organization in New York City, where she was one of his students. They were married for almost 53 years until Benton's death in 1975; Rita died eleven weeks after her husband. The couple had a son, Thomas Piacenza Benton, born in 1926, and a daughter, Jessie Benton, born in 1939. Later career =Dedication to Regionalism= In 1924, Benton depicted three landmarks in New York City's Madison Square within his painting New York, Early Twenties. General Store (1922) drawing by Thomas Hart Benton, created during his 1920s tour of America On his return to New York in the early 1920s, Benton declared himself an \\"enemy of modernism\\"; he began the naturalistic and representational work today known as Regionalism. He toured America, making sketches and ink wash drawings of the things he saw. He would go back to these sketches again and again as reference for future paintings. He expanded the scale of his Regionalist works, culminating in his America Today murals at the New School for Social Research in 1930–31. In 1984 the murals were purchased and restored by AXA Equitable to hang in the lobby of the AXA Equitable Tower at 1290 Sixth Avenue in New York City.\\"The Collection\\" , AXA Gallery, accessed 2 August 2012 In December 2012 AXA donated the murals to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\\"AXA Equitable Donates America Today, Thomas Hart Benton's Epic Mural Cycle Celebrating Life in 1920s America, to Metropolitan Museum\\" The Met's exhibition \\"Thomas Hart Benton's 'America Today' Mural Rediscovered\\" ran until April 19, 2015. The murals were described as showing how Benton absorbed and used the influence of the Greek artist El Greco. Benton broke through to the mainstream in 1932. A relative unknown, he won a commission to paint the murals of Indiana life planned by the state in the 1933 Century of Progress Exhibition in Chicago. The Indiana Murals stirred controversy; Benton painted everyday people, and included a portrayal of events in the state's history which some people did not want publicized. Critics attacked his work for showing Ku Klux Klan (KKK) members in full regalia. The KKK reached its peak membership in 1925. In Indiana, 30% of adult males were estimated to be members of the Klan, and in 1924 KKK members were elected as governor, and to other political offices. These mural panels are now displayed at Indiana University in Bloomington, with the majority hung in the \\"Hall of Murals\\" at the Auditorium. Four additional panels are displayed in the former University Theatre (now the Indiana Cinema) connected to the Auditorium. Two panels, including the one with images of the KKK, are located in a lecture classroom at Woodburn Hall.. In 1932, Benton also painted The Arts of Life in America, a set of large murals for an early site of the Whitney Museum of American Art.. Major panels include Arts of the City, Arts of the West, Arts of the South and Indian Arts.. In 1953 five of the panels were purchased by the New Britain Museum of American Art in Connecticut, and have since been displayed there. On December 24, 1934, Benton was featured on one of the earliest color covers of Time magazine.For an online reproduction of the cover, see . Benton's work was featured along with that of fellow Midwesterners Grant Wood and John Steuart Curry in an article entitled \\"The U.S. Scene\\". The trio were featured as the new heroes of American art, and Regionalism was described as a significant art movement.. In 1935, after he had \\"alienated both the left-leaning community of artists with his disregard for politics and the larger New York-Paris art world with what was considered his folksy style\\",. Benton left the artistic debates of New York for his native Missouri. He was commissioned to create a mural for the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City. A Social History of Missouri is perhaps Benton's greatest work. In an interview in 1973, he said, \\"If I have any right to make judgments, I would say that the Missouri mural was my best work\\".American Heritage magazine, June 1973, page 87. As with his earlier work, controversy arose over his portrayal of the state's history, as he included the subjects of slavery, the Missouri outlaw Jesse James, and the political boss Tom Pendergast. With his return to Missouri, Benton embraced the Regionalist art movement. He settled in Kansas City and accepted a teaching job at the Kansas City Art Institute. This base afforded Benton greater access to rural America, which was changing rapidly. Because of his Populist political upbringing, Benton's sympathy was with the working class and the small farmer, unable to gain material advantage despite the Industrial Revolution. His works often show the melancholy, desperation and beauty of small-town life. In the late 1930s he created some of his best-known work, including the allegorical nude Persephone. It was considered scandalous by the Kansas City Art Institute, and was borrowed by the showman Billy Rose, who hung it in his New York nightclub, the Diamond Horseshoe. It is now held by the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City. Karal Ann Marling, an art historian, says it is \\"one of the great works of American pornography.\\" In 1937, Benton published his autobiography An Artist in America, which was critically acclaimed. The writer Sinclair Lewis said of it: \\"Here’s a rare thing, a painter who can write.\\"\\"Slim, Jim, and Lem\\", Newsweek, November 1, 1937, p. 25 During this period Benton also began to produce signed, limited- edition lithographs, which were sold at $5.00 each through the Associated American Artists Galleries based in New York.The Lithographs of Thomas Hart Benton. Compiled and edited by Creekmore Fath. University of Texas Press, 1969, p. 3. =Teaching career= Benton's autobiography indicates that his son was enrolled from age 3 to 9 at the City and Country School in New York in exchange for his teaching art there. \\"Learning from Children: The Life and Legacy of Caroline Pratt, p. 131 by Mary Huaser Peter Lang Publishers, 2006\\" He included the school's founder, Caroline Pratt, in \\"City Activities with Dance Hall\\", one of the ten panels in America Today. \\"Caroline Pratt and Thomas Hart Benton Go to the MET\\" Benton taught at the Art Students League of New York from 1926 to 1935 and at the Kansas City Art Institute from 1935 to 1941. His most famous student, Jackson Pollock, whom he mentored in the Art Students League, founded the Abstract Expressionist movement. Pollock often said that Benton's traditional teachings gave him something to rebel against.Abstract Expressionism: Creators and Critics, p. 137, ed. Clifford Ross, Abrahams Publishers, New York 1990 With another of his students, Glen Rounds, who went on to become a prolific author and illustrator of children's books, Benton spent a summer touring the Western United States in the early 1930s. Benton's students in New York and Kansas City included many painters who contributed significantly to American art. They included Pollock's brother Charles Pollock, Eric Bransby, Charles Banks Wilson, Frederic James, Lamar Dodd, Reginald Marsh, Charles Green Shaw, Margot Peet, Jackson Lee Nesbitt, Roger Medearis, Glenn Gant, Fuller Potter, and Delmer J. Yoakum.Marianne Berardi, Under the Influence: The Students of Thomas Hart Benton, Kansas City: The Albrecht-Kemper Museum of Art, 1993 Benton also briefly taught Dennis Hopper at the Kansas City Art Institute; Hopper was later known for being an independent actor, filmmaker, and photographer.. In 1941, Benton was dismissed from the Art Institute after he said the typical art museum was \\"a graveyard run by a pretty boy with delicate wrists and a swing in his gait.\\" He made additional disparaging references to what he said was the excessive influence of homosexuals (which he called \\"the third sex\\") in the art world.. Later life During World War II Benton created a series titled The Year of Peril, which portrayed the threat to American ideals by fascism and Nazism. The prints were widely distributed. Following the war, Regionalism fell from favor, eclipsed by the rise of Abstract Expressionism. Benton remained active for another 30 years, but his work included less contemporary social commentary and portrayed pre-industrial farmlands. Benton was hired in 1940, along with eight other prominent American artists, to document dramatic scenes and characters during the production of the film The Long Voyage Home, a cinematic adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's plays. Benton was also an accomplished harmonica musician, recording an album for Decca Records in 1942 titled Saturday Night at Tom Benton's. He continued to paint murals, including Lincoln (1953), for Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri; Trading At Westport Landing (1956), for The River Club in Kansas City; Father Hennepin at Niagara Falls (1961) for the Power Authority of the State of New York; Joplin at the Turn of the Century (1972) in Joplin; and Independence and the Opening of the West, for the Harry S. Truman Library in Independence. His commission for the Truman Library mural led to his developing a friendship with Harry S. Truman that lasted until the former U.S. President's death. Benton died in 1975 at work in his studio, as he completed his final mural, The Sources of Country Music, for the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tennessee. Legacy and honors Benton was elected into the National Academy of Design in 1954 as an Associate member and became a full member in 1956. In 1961, Benton was chosen as one of 50 outstanding Americans of meritorious performance in the fields of endeavor, to be honored as a Guest of Honor to the first annual Banquet of the Golden Plate in Monterey, California. Honor was awarded by vote of the National Panel of Distinguished Americans of the Academy of Achievement. Exterior of the Thomas Hart Benton Home and Studio State Historic SiteIn 1977, Benton's 2-1/2 story late-Victorian residence and carriage house studio in Kansas City was designated by Missouri as the Thomas Hart Benton Home and Studio State Historic Site. The historic site has been preserved nearly unchanged from the time of his death; clothing, furniture, and paint brushes are still in place. Displaying 13 original works of his art, the house museum is open for guided tours. Benton was the subject of the eponymous 1988 documentary, Thomas Hart Benton, directed by Ken Burns. In December 2019, a lawsuit was filed against the long-time Benton estate manager, UMB Bank. The suit alleges that \\"More than a hundred paintings gone, priceless works of art stored in subpar conditions, paintings sold for fire sale prices - those are the allegations put forward by a new lawsuit filed by the heirs of famous American artist Thomas Hart Benton.\\" The bank did not directly respond to the specific allegations in the lawsuit but characterized them as misguided. The bank's president, Jim Rine, said that it regrets that the Bentons chose to resolve the issue through litigation and that the bank takes its role as trustee of Benton's art very seriously.

It was founded in 1973 by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and features a \\"consciousness-based education\\" system that includes the practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique. Its founding principles include the development of the full potential of the individual, fulfilling economic aspirations while maximizing proper use of the environment and bringing spiritual fulfillment and happiness to humanity. The university is regionally accredited through the doctoral level by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) and offers degree programs in art, business, education, communications, mathematical science, literature, physiology & health, Vedic Science and sustainable living. The original campus was located in Goleta, California, and in 1974 moved to the current 370-acre campus in Fairfield, Iowa. During the 1990s many older buildings were demolished and replaced using green technology and the principles of ancient Vedic architecture. The university features an academic \\"block system\\" (only one subject for four weeks) and a diverse, multinational student body. It is said to offer an organic, vegetarian food program.Dorfman, Josh (2007) Harry N.

It was created with the belief that a school that incorporated the \\"philosophy and techniques of Transcendental Meditation\\" would create an \\"unusual contribution to higher education\\". It was inaugurated by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and Robert Keith Wallace assumed his position as the first university president in 1973. Its first location was an apartment complex in Goleta, California. The university enrolled 700 students during its first year of operation. In August 1974, the university purchased the campus of the bankrupt Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa, for $2.5 million and relocated there.Engel, Allison, \\"Maharishi International University mixes meditation and education\\", Change Vol 7 No 4 (May 1975) p. 19Nelson, Bryce (July 9, 1973) \\"The Death of a College—Grand Idea That Failed\\", Los Angeles Times, The college trustees asked for protection of the federal court under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act.

All students, regardless of their previous education, were required to attend 24 interdisciplinary courses, some of which consisted of pre-recorded video tapes of \\"resident faculty\\" who were not on campus, while graduate students and teaching assistants played the video tapes and conducted discussions. Nobel Prize winner Melvin Calvin said that, even though he participated in a symposium on SCI, the use of his name in the MIU catalogue was \\"perilously close to false advertising\\". John Lewis, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who created video-taped lectures for MIU, was supportive, saying that TM \\"unblocks the student's pathways to education\\". During this period, an open admissions policy was instituted, and transfer students were welcomed regardless of their academic history. In 1976, the accreditation evaluation team from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools said the 19 senior and 20 assistant faculty were \\"creative in their vision for higher education and eminently qualified\\", and the university was granted \\"candidate for accreditation\\" status. At that time, faculty and administrators were paid \\"approximately the same base salary of $275 per month\\", with additional compensation \\"on a sliding scale for those with spouses and children\\", plus free housing in university dormitories.Maeroff, Gene I., \\"College in Iowa flourishes on meditation\\", The New York Times (May 18, 1976) p. 16 Reprinted On campus, drugs and alcohol were \\"shunned\\" and a \\"strong sense of community\\" was said to pervade the institution. Bevan Morris was appointed president and chairman of Maharishi International University's board of trustees in 1979. The following year, the university received accreditation through the doctoral level by the Higher Learning Commission, and became a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCACS).Kapur, Kamlesh (2010) Sterling Publishers, History Of Ancient India (Portraits Of A Nation), pp. 462–463 1981 saw the completion of two 20,000 square foot meditation buildings called Golden Domes, that were built on campus for daily group practice of the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programs.Magician Mixes Marriage and Meditation; The Hour (Associated Press) Norwalk, CT, December 2, 1981 By this time the Henn Mansion, Trustee Gymnasium and Ballard Hall buildings, built in the early 1900s, showed rapid deterioration.

As a result, \\"many students\\" who were distributing Carlsen's literature on campus were asked to leave the campus and several were suspended with their meditation dome admission privileges revoked.Munns, Roger, \\"Upstart stirring up the karma\\", Owosso Argus-Press (Associated Press) (July 21, 1983) In December 1983, the university hosted a three-week \\"Taste of Utopia\\" conference with more than 7,000 participants and practitioners of the TM-Sidhi program \\"from around the world\\".

In 1995, Maharishi International University changed its name to Maharishi University of Management (MUM). As part of its master plan to rebuild and expand the campus using natural materials and Maharishi Vastu Architecture design principles, many of the Parsons College buildings, which had high maintenance costs, were demolished, including Foster Hall. In 2019, the name was changed back to the original Maharishi International University. In 2000, local preservationists protested the demolition of Parsons Hall, built in 1915, and Barhydt Chapel, designed in 1911 by Henry K. Holsman. University officials said that MIU would donate the buildings to any community group who could raise the $1 million needed to move what the local newspaper described as an \\"ailing building\\".Beth Dalby, \\"M.U.M. reveals plans for Barhydt Chapel, Fairfield Ledger, November 17, 2000, p. 1 In response to protests the university ensured the survival of the chapel's plaques, pipe organ, and stained glass windows, which are now displayed at the Fairfield Arts & Convention Center. Between 2000 and 2005, the university demolished Carnegie Hall, Parsons Hall (1915), Barhydt Chapel (1911), Blum Stadium (1966), Laser Tower, the dining hall, and 38 dormitory- style \\"pods\\". Seven student \\"residence halls\\" with single rooms were completed in 2005 using eco-friendly designs, natural materials and geo-thermal heating. Moby performing in 2008 A stabbing incident occurred in 2004, when MIU student Shuvender Sem attacked two other students in separate incidents on the same day. He stabbed the first student with a pen and, hours later, fatally stabbed Levi Butler with a knife. Sem was found not guilty due to insanity and the university settled a lawsuit that charged it with negligence. =2005–present= Beginning in 2005, film director David Lynch hosted an annual \\"David Lynch Weekend for World Peace and Meditation\\" at MIU.

In the book, she cites two former professors who in the late 1980s \\"testified against the research practices conducted at the university\\". In the book, she writes that former MIU professor of economics and business law Anthony DeNaro alleged in 1986 that there was \\"a very serious and deliberate pattern of fraud ... designed to misrepresent the TM movement as a science (not a cult), and fraudulently claim and obtain tax exempt status with the IRS\\". Williamson writes in her book that Dennis Roark, former dean of faculty and chair of the physics department in the 1970s, was a \\"witness to routine suppression of negative data\\" and that Roark wrote in a 1987 letter that it was his \\"belief that the many scientific claims both to the factual evidence of unique, beneficial effects of T.M. and physics are not only without any reasonable basis, but in fact in many ways fraudulent\\". Roark said \\"he had questioned\\" MIU faculty member Michael Dillbeck regarding his studies of brain wave coherence using EEG measurements during practice of the TM-Sidhi program, and that Dilbeck confirmed that it was impossible to make EEG measurements while the subjects are moving. Williamson writes in her book that Roark questioned other investigators \\"regarding the alleged reduction in crime if enough people practice TM or the TM-Sidhi program\\" and they \\"confirmed that they had suppressed negative evidence\\". The EEG research referred to by Roark, which required researchers to make EEG measurements during the TM-Sidhi program, was subsequently published in two separate studies in the International Journal of Neuroscience. The editor-in-chief, Sydney Weinstein, said that the studies published in his journal are reviewed by \\"a distinguished group of scientists from leading universities,\\" and added, \\"Not once have these scientists ever questioned the integrity or scientific validity of the papers on Transcendental Meditation.\\" In 2002, The Gazette (Cedar Rapids and Iowa City) and Chicago Sun-Times reported that although \\"a few years ago\\" many \\"major medical schools\\" would have \\"turned up their noses\\" at the studies MIU was conducting, \\"things have changed\\" and MIU has received so many offers that it has \\"turned away\\" collaboration proposals from a few institutions.Krantz, Colleen, (September 12, 2002) Schools team with Maharishi Gets requests to be partner on studies of alternative medicine, Chicago Sun-Times According to an MIU spokesperson, the university had received almost $18 million in grant support from the National Institutes of Health in the prior 15 years and \\"its researchers are strict about scientific standards because they work more often with other, larger universities\\" including the University of Iowa; University of California, Irvine; and University of Hawaii. The article reports that Maharishi University and the University of Iowa were working on a study that looked at the effects of holistic therapy on heart disease. According to news reports in 2003, MIU's Center for Natural Medicine and Prevention (CNMP) was in collaboration with a \\"growing list of mainstream universities\\" including Howard University, the Medical College of Wisconsin, the University of Pennsylvania, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science and the University of California at Irvine. According to the article, \\"mainstream medical researchers – including many scientists suspicious of spiritualism\\" no longer believe that MIU's research is junk science. Reception MIU has received both criticism and acclaim. Author Samuel Schuman reports that while many in the higher education community did not take the university seriously when it began in 1974, the college has \\"persisted cheerfully\\" for more than three decades and its achievements and results are \\"incontestably impressive\\". Some members of the local community were initially against the university with 540 residents signing a petition protesting the local school board for allowing four MIU students to visit the public schools as observers. However, author William Jefferson reports that by 1976, 200 local people had \\"taken up Transcendental Meditation themselves\\" and compared to the \\"wild and woolly\\" students of the prior college, \\"nearly all the residents now agree that they [MIU students] are nice people to have around\\". A 1976 article in The New York Times described the campus as a \\"cheerful, optimistic place where people smile a lot and tend to be considerate and trusting\\". In 1992 The New York Times reported that the university was a place where all students and faculty meditate, and all the Maharishi's teachings are woven into mathematics, physics and every other subject, similar to colleges with strong religious affiliations, while noting it is \\"an accredited university with grant-winning faculty members and competitive students\\". The article goes on to say that even as the university gains research grants and subsequent credibility, it also faces controversy. For example, one critic, 1979 alumnus Curtis Mailloux, called the campus a \\"coercive environment\\" with a \\"propensity for fraudulent research\\". Accreditation officials say they are aware of these accusations and \\"have been aggressive in checking Marahishi International's academic freedom\\". The deputy director of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCACS), Steven D. Crow, says \\"Every move the university's made has been monitored\\" and MIU's library, faculty, academic mission and classroom space have been deemed appropriate. At the same time John W. Patterson, a professor at Iowa State University has harshly criticized The North Central Association's evaluation, saying it \\"does nothing more than to lend credibility to these crackpots\\". The article also reports that many non- students have moved to the city of Fairfield \\"so they can meditate in the [campus meditation] domes\\". In 1986, seven \\"former devotees\\" filed a fraud suit against the Maharishi saying they paid thousands of dollars for lessons at Maharishi International University that were designed to reduce stress, improve memory, reverse aging, and develop clairvoyance and levitation. One plaintiff said that after ten years he had not acquired any of the special abilities that were promised. According to reviews of the 1992 book, Heaven on Earth – Dispatches from America’s Spiritual Frontier, author and reporter Michael D'Antonio wrote that the MIU physics department was teaching theories that he believed were \\"dead wrong\\" and alleged that the university had taken Transcendental Meditation \\"into a grandiose narcissistic dream, a form of intellectual bondage, that they call enlightenment\\". MIU is listed in Peterson's 440 Great Colleges for Top Students 2010. According to the National Survey of Student Engagement MIU scored in the top 3% for \\"active and collaborative learning,\\" in the top 4% for \\"enriching educational experience,\\" in the top 7% for \\"student/faculty interaction,\\" in the top 8% for \\"supportive campus environment,\\" and in the top 26% for \\"level of academic challenge.\\" MIU graduates also gave their college experience a \\"higher than average satisfaction\\" rating as recorded in the \\"annual ACT alumni survey.\\" Specifically, 73% said they would choose MIU again, more than twice the national average of 32%. The university has been categorized as a \\"Sierra Club Cool School\\" and in 2014 was ranked as the fourth best environmental science school by career guide website, Environmental Science. In popular culture The Beach Boys recorded their 1978 album M.I.U. Album on the campus, and named it after the university. Man on the Moon, a biopic of entertainer Andy Kaufman, includes a scene at Maharishi International University in which Kaufman is asked to leave a retreat because his behavior was unbecoming an enlightened individual. In October 2011, Oprah Winfrey visited MIU, toured the campus and attended a group meditation in the golden dome for ladies.\\"Oprah Winfrey visited Maharishi University in Fairfield (Iowa)Personal development and spiritual blog: AmAre happiness blog\\", October 21, 2011 Video footage of her visit to the MIU campus was shown on an episode of her show.Sundays at 9/8c on OWN #Nextchapter, Retrieved 27 March 2012\\"Fairfield's fame levitates after Oprah's meditation\\" Des Moines Register, March 24, 2012 Notable alumni and faculty Noted alumni include self-help author Peter McWilliams, Nat Goldhaber, an original founder of the University, ufologist Jeff Peckman who attended for one year, and Ron Parker, a Canadian Natural Law Party candidate who received his PhD in physics from MIU.

He served as U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense from 1969 to 1971 during the Nixon administration. Packard served as President of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) from 1976 to 1981 and chairman of its Board of Regents from 1973 to 1982. He was a member of the Trilateral Commission. Packard was the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1988 and is noted for many technological innovations and philanthropic endeavors. Personal life Packard was born in Pueblo, Colorado, the son of Ella (Graber) and Sperry Sidney Packard, an attorney.https://www.packard.org/insights/news/the-sperry-s-and-ella-graber- packard-fund-for-pueblo/ He attended Centennial High School, where early on he showed an interest in science, engineering, sports, and leadership. Packard earned his B.A. from Stanford University in 1934, where he earned letters in football and basketball and attained membership in the Phi Beta Kappa Society and was a Brother of the Alpha Delta Phi Literary Fraternity. Stanford is where he met two people who were important to his life, Lucile Salter and Bill Hewlett. Packard briefly attended the University of Colorado at Boulder before taking a position with the General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York. In 1938, he returned to Stanford, where he earned a master's degree in electrical engineering later that year. In the same year, he married Lucile Salter, with whom he had four children: David, Nancy, Susan, and Julie. Lucile Packard died in 1987 (age 72).  Hewlett-Packard  In 1939, Packard and Hewlett established Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Packard's garage with an initial capital investment of $538 (). Packard mentions in his book The HP Way that the name Hewlett-Packard was determined by the flip of a coin: HP, rather than PH! Their first product was an audio frequency oscillator sold to Walt Disney Studios for use on the soundtrack of Fantasia. The company grew into the world's largest producer of electronic testing and measurement devices. It also became a major producer of calculators, computers, and laser and ink jet printers. HP incorporated in 1947, with Packard becoming its first president, serving in that role until 1964. He was then elected Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, holding those positions through 1968. Packard left HP in 1969 to serve in the Nixon administration until 1971, at which time he returned to HP and was re-elected Chairman of the Board, serving from 1972 to 1993. In 1991, Packard oversaw a major reorganization at HP. He retired from HP in 1993. At the time of his death in 1996, Packard's stake in the company was worth more than $1 billion. At Packard's instruction, the domain name \\"HP.com\\" was registered on March 3, 1986, and as such was one of the earliest to be registered.  Department of Defense  Upon entering office in 1969, President Richard M. Nixon appointed Packard U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense under Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird. Packard resigned in December 1971 and returned to Hewlett-Packard in 1972 as Chairman of the Board. While serving in the Department of Defense (DoD), he brought concepts of resource management used in business to the military, as well as establishing the Defense Systems Management College. In 1970, Packard issued a memorandum that contained a number of major reforms designed to address \\"the real mess we have on our hands.\\" A key reform was elimination of Robert MacNamara's Total Package Procurement except in rare situations. Near the end of his time at DoD, Packard wrote the \\"Packard Memo\\" or \\"Employment of Military Resources in the Event of Civil Disturbances\\". Enacted in February 1972, the actTitle 32: National Defense -- Part 214-Employment of Military Resources in the Event of Civil Disturbances , February 18, 1972. describes exceptions to the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which limited the powers of the federal government to use the U.S. military for law enforcement, except where expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress -- noting that the Constitution provides an exception when needed \\"to prevent loss of life or wanton destruction of property and to restore governmental functioning and public order when sudden and unexpected civil disturbances, disasters, or calamities seriously endanger life and property and disrupt normal governmental functions to such an extent that duly constituted local authorities are unable to control the situations\\" and \\"to protect Federal property and Federal governmental functions when the need for protection exists and duly constituted local authorities are unable or decline to provide adequate protection\\".32 U.S.C. § 214.4 Legal consideration . § 214.5 states that \\"employment of DoD military resources for assistance to civil authorities in controlling civil disturbances will normally be predicated upon the issuance of a Presidential Executive order or Presidential directive authorizing\\", with exceptions \\"limited to: #Cases of sudden and unexpected emergencies as described in §215.4(c)(1)(i), which require that immediate military action be taken. #Providing military resources to civil authorities as prescribed in §215.9 of this part.\\"32 U.S.C. § 214.5 Policies According to Lindorff, these exceptions reinstate the possibility of martial law in the U.S., prohibited since 1878. In the 1970s and 1980s Packard was a prominent advisor to the White House on defense procurement and management. He served as chairman of The Business Council in 1973 and 1974.The Business Council, Official website, Background From 1985–86, he served as chairman of The Packard Commission.  Philanthropy  From the early 1980s until his death in 1996, Packard dedicated much of his time and money to philanthropic projects.The Philanthropy Hall of Fame, David Packard In 1964, Packard and his wife had established the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. In 1986, they donated $40 million toward building what became the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University; the new hospital opened in June 1991. Prompted by his daughters Nancy and Julie, in 1978 David and Lucile had created the Monterey Bay Aquarium Foundation. The couple eventually donated $55 million to build the new aquarium, which opened in 1984 with Julie Packard as its executive director. In 1987, Packard gave $13 million to create the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. Packard and Hewlett made a combined donation of $77 million to Stanford in 1994, for which the university named the David Packard Electrical Engineering Building in his honor. Packard was a member of the American Enterprise Institute's board of trustees. He died on March 26, 1996 at age 83 in Stanford, California, leaving approximately $4 billion (the bulk of his estate) to the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, including large amounts of valuable real property in Los Altos Hills. All three Packard daughters sit on the Foundation's board of trustees.

The second rider on the tandem is Lisette Marton, women's European Champion, one of Simpson-sponsored athletes. The Simpson Chain or Simpson Lever Chain was an English-made bicycle chain invented by William Spears Simpson in 1895. The design departed from the standard roller bicycle chain: it was composed of linked triangles forming two levels. The inner level was driven by the chainring and the outer drove the rear cog. Instead of teeth, the chainring and cog had grooves into which the rollers of the chain engaged. Simpson made claims, widely discredited, that the levers of this chain provided a mechanical advantage that could amplify energy produced by the cyclist. Simpson hired top cyclists such as Constant Huret, Lisette Marton, and Tom Linton (of Paris-Bordeaux fame), and the Gladiator Pacing Team from France to race for high stakes in England for the Chain Matches. His teams were largely successful. Jimmy Michael (depicted in the first draft of the Toulouse-Lautrec's advertisement) attended the so- called Chain Race at Catford track in 1896. Simpson was so insistent that it was an improvement over conventional chains that he staked part of his fortune on it.

This was the heyday of pacing, when the famous Dunlop team of quads and triplets was available. Dunlops arranged the pacing for the plain chain men, and turned out some 80 riders and £2 000-worth of pacing machines. Simpson's brought over the Gladiator team of pacemakers from Paris, consisting of 12 assorted quads and quints [five-man bicycles] and several triplets.\\" When the 1890s cycling boom ended, the Simpson Lever Chain company collapsed spectacularly, under the stewardship of the notorious entrepreneur and financier Ernest Terah Hooley, who had earlier acquired the rights to the chain from Simpson. The company was ultimately wound up in 1898, prompting the first of Hooley's four bankruptcies.Philip McCouat, \\"Toulouse-Lautrec, bicycling and the women's movement\\", Journal of Art in Society, http://www.artinsociety.com/toulouse-lautrec-the-bicycle-and-the- women's-movement.html This invention would probably have been long forgotten except that: * The Simpson Chain is portrayed in a work of the French post- impressionist artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. * The Simpson Lever Chain Racing Team employed the Belgian cyclist Hélène Dutrieu who became a stunt cyclist and pioneering aviator. * Simpson's promotions were so widespread and effective that much of his promotional material is collected today.

Distinct from traditional ayurveda, it emphasizes the role of consciousness, and gives importance to positive emotions.For a brief history of traditional ayurveda, and selected translations from the original Sanskrit sources, see Maharishi Ayur-Veda has been variously characterized as emerging from, and consistently reflecting, the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, representing the entirety of the ayurvedic tradition.Cynthia Ann Humes, \\"Maharishi Ayur-Veda\\", chapter 17 in A 1991 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that promoters of MVAH failed to disclose financial incentives when they submitted a letter for publication and that their marketing practices were misleading. A 2008 study published in JAMA reported that two of the 19 Maharishi Ayurveda products tested contained heavy metals. A 1991 British case found two physicians guilty of \\"serious professional misconduct\\" for using MVAH in the unsuccessful treatment of HIV. Theoretical basis Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health uses a model for understanding health and disease that is fundamentally different from that of modern medicine. According to MVAH researcher Hari Sharma, MVAH views the body as an abstract pattern of intelligence whereas he feels modern medicine views the body as a machine. He says that the world view of MVAH is closer to the reality described by 20th century physics, which challenged the reductionist materialist world view by finding that quantum mechanical phenomena contradict the idea of solid matter, that causality is less definite, that material existence is connected in unexpected and nonlocal ways, and that a reductionist view is untenable at the quantum level. Sharma says that \\"Vedic thought discusses a unified field of pure, non-material intelligence and consciousness whose modes of vibration manifest as the material universe.\\" Disease results from losing connection with this underlying field of intelligence.Hari Sharma, \\"Contemporary Ayurveda,\\" chapter 32 in Kenneth G Zysk, \\"Traditional Medicine of India,\\" chapter 29 in Components The approach does not use modern medicine or biology. According to Hari Sharma, MVAH views the body as an abstract pattern of intelligence.Hari Sharma, \\"Contemporary Ayurveda\\", chapter 32 in Proponents claim that through MVAH, the Maharishi revived the ancient Vedic system of health care. MVAH identifies 40 approaches, each said to be based on one of the 40 branches of Vedic literature. In Alternative Medicine and Ethics, Stephen Barrett describes 20 components to Maharishi Ayurveda: > The full range of the Maharishi Ayur-Veda program 'for creating healthy > individuals and a disease free society' has 20 components: development of > higher states of consciousness through advanced meditation techniques, use > of primordial sounds, correction of the \\"mistake of the intellect', > strengthening of the emotions, vedic structuring of language, music therapy, > enlivening of the senses, pulse diagnosis, psychophysiological integration, > neuromuscular integration, neurorespiratory integration, purification (to > remove 'impurities due to faulty diet or behavioral patterns'), dietary > measures, herbal food supplements, other herbal preparations, daily > behavioral routines, prediction of future imbalances, religious ceremonies, > nourishing the environment and promoting world health and peace. Most of > these cost several hundred dollars but some cost thousands and require the > service of an ayurvedic practitioner. A traditional vaidya treats patients individually, diagnosing them and then individually preparing or instructing the patient how to prepare treatments for the entire complexity of their individual symptoms, whereas Maharishi Ayur-Veda takes a mass-market approach.Manasi Tirodkar, \\"Cultural Loss and Remembrance in Contemporary Ayurvedic Medical Practice,\\" chapter 13 in =Technique= The TM technique is the main modality which proponents say improves mental health and promotes \\"collective health\\" in MVAH. A 2007 review of meditative practices that included Transcendental Meditation concluded that the definitive health effects of meditation cannot be determined as the scientific evidence was of poor quality, though the review has been criticized for using an inappropriate method for assessing quality. The review found that TM \\"had no advantage over health education to improve measures of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, body weight, heart rate, stress, anger, self-efficacy, cholesterol, dietary intake, and level of physical activity in hypertensive patients\\". Another review did find a reduction in diastolic and systolic blood pressure in those who practiced TM compared to controls. The review and its primary author were partially funded by Howard Settle, a proponent of TM. =Pulse diagnosis= Practitioners utilize pulse diagnosis (known in Sanskrit as \\"nadi vigyan\\"), which they say is like \\"plugging into the inner intelligence of the body\\". Based on \\"imbalances\\", recommendations related to herbal preparations, diet, daily and seasonal routines, exercise, and physiological purification are offered. Proponents say that the pulse can be used to detect \\"imbalances at early stages when there may be no other clinical signs and when mild forms of intervention may suffice\\". According to Deepak Chopra and Sharma, pulse diagnosis can detect a variety of diseases, including those unrelated to the cardiovascular system, including asthma, cancer, and diabetes. William Jarvis, president of The National Council Against Health Fraud, described pulse diagnosis as a variety of palm reading and that Chopra refused to have pulse diagnosis tested by JAMA in a blinded protocol \\"on the grounds that a blinded experiment would 'eliminate the most crucial component of the experiment, which is consciousness.'\\" =Multimodal therapies= MVAH health centers and spas offer a series of multimodal therapies including a purification therapy called panchakarma. Panchakarma means \\"five actions\\", and is intended to clear impurities from the body and to balance the doṣas. The first preparatory step is called \\"snehana\\", involving the ingestion of prescribed quantities of ghee over several days, followed by a purgative. The actual panchakarma then begins with \\"abhyanga\\", a herbalized full-body oil massage and continues with one or more additional treatments, including \\"svedana\\", a herbalized steam bath; \\"shirodhara\\", in which warm sesame oil is poured on the forehead; \\"nasya\\", an oil massage of head, neck and shoulders combined with steam inhalation and nasal drops; and \\"basti\\", a herbal enema. Additional therapies generally undertaken in association with panchakarma are \\"Maharishi Gandharva Veda\\" music therapy and aromatherapy. Typical panchakarma treatments take 2 hours per day, over the course of 3 to 14 days, and are recommended several times per year as ideal, usually in conjunction with the change of seasons. =Products= MAPI offices, in the Fairfield Business Park located north of Fairfield, Iowa.Fairfield Business Park It was built according to Maharishi Sthapatya Veda principles. Herbal products are manufactured and distributed by several Maharishi Ayurveda companies, including: Maharishi Ayurveda Products Pvt. Ltd. (MAPPL) in New Delhi, Maharishi Ayurveda Products International (MAPI) in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Maharishi Ayurveda Products Europe B.V., in the Netherlands. Maharishi Ayurveda Products International (MAPI) of Colorado Springs sells more than 400 products and in 2000, was said to be the largest ayurvedic company in North America, with reported sales of $20 million in 1999. Some ayurvedic herbal formulas are called rasayanas that use whole plants in various combinations.Marc Micozzi, \\"Ayurveda Medicine,\\" chapter 16 in Maharishi Amrit Kalash The original Maharishi Ayurveda product is Maharishi Amrit Kalash (MAK), a two-part ancient formula introduced by Balraj Maharishi based on classical ayurvedic texts and referred to as \\"nectar\\" and \\"ambrosia\\" or \\"MAK-4\\" and \\"MAK-5\\". It uses a combination of dozens of different herbs and fruits. Ingredients include herbs such as White Musali, Liquorice, Giant Potato, Aswagandha, Gum Arabic tree, Indian asparagus, caper, aloe, Curculigo orchioides, Amla, Tinospora cordifolia, simpleleaf chastetree and elephant creeper.Marc Micozzi, \\"Ayurveda Medicine,\\" chapter 16 in Heavy metals A 2008 study by Robert B. Saper, published in JAMA, found that one-fifth of 213 ayurvedic samples manufactured in either the U.S. or India and obtained via the Internet contained detectable levels of heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury or lead. Two of 19 MAPI products tested, \\"Vital Lady\\" and \\"Worry Free\\" were found to have detectable levels of lead, while the others had no detectable levels of lead, mercury, or arsenic. Ted Wallace, president of MAPI, stated that the company tests its products before and after shipment from India to the US, and that its products are examined for purity, heavy metals, residual pesticides, and biological contaminants. Michael McGuffin, president of the American Herbal Products Association said that eliminating every trace of arsenic, mercury or lead from products would require \\"an entirely new food supply\\". According to McGuffin, the government and professional agencies set widely different safety standards for lead, mercury and arsenic and that while most of the products in Saper's article have lead levels that exceed California's standard, only two violate the World Health Organization's standard. A 2008 review has stated that \\"adverse health outcomes at blood lead levels below this threshold have been well demonstrated\\", and concluded that \\"it is increasingly acknowledged there is no threshold for the adverse consequences of lead exposure\\". In 2008, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court against Maharishi Vedic Education Development Corporation (\\"MVED\\"), Maharishi Ayurveda Foundation and Maharishi Ayurveda Products Ltd. (\\"MAP Ltd\\"). The Plaintiff claims that she contracted lead poisoning from Garbhapal Ras, an herbo-mineral product she purchased in India. According to the Iowa Department of Public Health, Garbhapal Ras contained nearly 3% lead. The product was manufactured by MAP Ltd. in India, and prescribed for her by a physician at the Maharishi Ayurveda Arogyadham clinic in Delhi. A spokesperson said that MVED is not involved in the manufacturing, prescribing, or sale of products from the Indian clinic where the product was prescribed and purchased. The spokesperson said that products sold in the U.S. are subject to inspection, testing, and quality control. David Whitley, director of \\"Ayurveda Limited\\" in the United Kingdom, writes that the Maharishi Ayurveda Council of Vaidyas approves of the use of arsenic, lead, and mercury under the supervision of trained and certified vaidyas, in accordance with ancient Ayurvedic texts. He claims that the benefits of heavy metals are increased and the side effects are minimized when used properly. Whitley acknowledges that these compounds cannot be licensed for sale in the UK. =Maharishi Sthapatya Veda= Homes in Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa built using the principles of Maharishi Sthapatya Veda Maharishi Sthapatya Veda (MSV), is a system of Vedic architecture. Maharishi Global Construction in Fairfield, Iowa designs buildings which \\"connect the individual intelligence of the occupant of the house to the cosmic intelligence of the universe\\", saying that homes with entrances facing west invite \\"poverty, lack of creativity and vitality\\" and \\"anxiety, depression, bad luck and even criminal tendencies\\". In Maharishi Sthapatya Veda, the architect takes into account three major factors: the orientation of the structure, room placement and the proportion of the rooms, windows, doors, walls etc. and their dimensions. =Maharishi Vedic Astrology= Maharishi Vedic Astrology (also known as Maharishi Jyotish) premises that planets influence individual health. Jotyish is a vedanga within the field of vedic literature. Maharishi Jyotish is premised on the ability to precisely calculate mathematically the unfolding pattern of life, and to locate the trends and tendencies of an individual life within that pattern, making it possible to determine in advance whether a difficult period was coming, and to take action in the present to amend a future difficulty. Maharishi Jyotish asserts that the solar system has an influence on the human brain, cells and DNA. According to the Maharishi and his successor, Tony Nader, there is a correspondence between the nine Grahas of Vedic Astrology and the structure of DNA, the brain and the structure of cells. Each graha is associated with a gemstone: Maharishi Vedic Astrology associates the planets with the basal ganglia, thalmus and hypothalmus; the 12 Bhavas (astrological houses) with cortical areas; the 12 Rashis (zodiac signs) with the cranial nerves; and the 27 Nakshatras (lunar mansions) with groups of the brainstem. Yagyas Correction of imbalances discovered through Maharishi Jyotish is possible, the Maharishi said, through the performance of \\"yagyas\\" by vedic pandits in India. Yagyas are ceremonies designed to restore the balance between the individual and the environment. Yagyas performed on Maha Shivaratri, (the day of Shiva), are said to enliven spiritual and material aspects of one's consciousness, and to promote progress in all areas of life; those performed on Maha Lakshmi are said to bring prosperity, growth and good fortune; while those performed on Akshaya Tritiya are said to enhance lasting success in one's activities.Cynthia Ann Humes, \\"Maharishi Ayur-Ved,\\" chapter 16 in Andrew Skolnick describes Maharishi Yagyas as Hindu ceremonies to appease the gods and beseech their help on behalf of afflicted followers that can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and which the patient neither takes part in nor witnesses. He wrote that, while Chopra and Nancy Lonsdorf, medical director of the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Center in Washington, D.C. denied that they prescribed yagyas or that yagyas were part of Maharishi Ayur-Veda, Chopra's Lancaster Center did recommend yagyas for its patients, and a TM- Movement fundraising letter states that Lonsdorf prescribed an $11,500 yagya for a seriously ill patient of hers.Skolnick, Andrew A.. \\"The Maharishi Caper: Or How to Hoodwink Top Medical Journals\\", Science Writers (Fall, 1991) According to Skolnick, patients with serious illnesses often paid hundreds or thousands of dollars for gemstones prescribed by Maharishi Jyotish astrologers. The movement's company called \\"Jyotish Gems\\" sells gemstones prescribed by Maharishi Jyotish astrologers to ward off the effects of bad influences in one's horoscope. Nader writes that various gemstones correspond to the planets of Maharisi Jyotish, and also correspond to parts of the body. The Maharishi described Maharishi Light Therapy with Gems (MLG) as a vedic technology. According to Rainer Picha, Minister of Health for the Global Country of World Peace, training in the therapeutic use of gemstones is conducted at the Maharishi European Research University (MERU) in Holland. Maharishi Vedic Vibration Technology According to its website, Maharishi Vedic Vibration Technology (MVVT), \\"utilizes a refined impulse of Vedic sound, or Vedic vibration, to enliven the inner intelligence of the body and restore proper functioning\\". According to author Cynthia Ann Humes MVVT consists of the recitation of mantras from Vedic or other orthodox texts by the MVVT expert, while blowing on or touching the afflicted body part.Cynthia Ann Humes, \\"Maharishi Ayur-Ved,\\" chapter 16 in Frontiers in Bioscience published two studies online in 2001, including one by Tony Nader, the Lebanese neuro-scientist and researcher, who succeeded the Maharishi. Sound therapy A form of classical Indian music called Maharishi Gandharva Veda is purported to integrate and harmonize the cycles and rhythms of the listener's body. Gandharva Veda is an upavedaA history of Indian philosophy, Volume 2, Surendranath Dasgupta, page 274 (Please clarify- which edition?) and is codified in a number of texts that came to be known collectively at Gandharva Veda, an auxiliary text attached to Sama Veda. Mukund Lath writes that Gandharva Veda is a sacred corpus of music, derived from the still more ancient sama, a sacred Vedic form of music.A Study of Dattilam (1978), Mukund lath Compact discs of the music are published by the Maharishi University of Management Press.Cynthia Ann Humes, \\"Maharishi Ayur- Veda\\", chapter 17 in Listening to recitation in Sanskrit from a specific branch of the vedic literature that corresponds to the appropriate area of the body as determined by a MVAH expert. Health Centers The Raj, a Maharishi Ayurveda health spa in Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa. According to the movement's Global Good News website, there are 23 Maharishi Vedic Health Centres in 15 countries. In 2011, the Maharishi Ayurveda Hospital in New Delhi, India became the first ayurvedic hospital in Northern India to receive accreditation from the National Hospital Accreditation Board of Hospitals (NABH). The Raj is a health spa in Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa Deepak Chopra founded the spa in 1987 and was its medical director. Ayurvedic spas have also been established in two locations in Germany: Bad Ems in Rhineland-Palatinate, and Bissendorf in Lower Saxony. Training Courses to train physicians, nurses and health professionals in the principles and practices of Maharishi Ayurveda are offered by the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Association of America (MAAA) in various locations in the USA. These courses include Continuing Medical Education credit. The faculty and curriculum committee of the MAAA include: Stuart Rothenberg, Robert Schneider, Walter Moelk, Nancy Lonsdorf, Richard Averbach, Gary Kaplan, and Vaidya Manohar Palakurthi. Courses are offered in conjunction with the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in La Jolla, California. Courses in Maharishi Ayur-Veda for health professionals are also conducted at the Maharishi College of Perfect Health, International Maharishi Ayur-Veda Training Centre at MERU, Holland. These courses include: post graduate training, Maharishi Aroma Therapy, Maharishi Light Therapy with Gems, Maharishi Ayur-Veda Health Educator, Vedic Mind-Body program and Presentation of Medical Research. The faculty includes Rainer Picha, Walter Mölk, Robert Keith Wallace, Roswitha Margarete Geelvink-Tradel, and Bob Apon. The Maharishi College of Vedic Medicine was located at 2721 Arizona Street, NE Albuquerque, New Mexico in the 1990s and 2000s. There is now a campus in San Diego. Origin of Ayurveda and its relationship to Maharishi Ayurveda Maharishi Ayur-Veda is described as a modern restoration of the holistic perspective of the original texts of Ayurveda found in the Vedas.It is argued by medical historians that the earliest writings on ayurveda owe more to early Buddhism and Indian asceticism generally than to the Vedas . In MVAH, the Veda is said to be an \\"abstract blueprint of creation\\". The knowledge and technologies of MVAH are based on the understanding that the order displayed throughout the entire universe, including within the human physiology, is governed by a fundamental underlying intelligence.Maharishi's Vedic Approach to Health, Modern Science and Vedic Science, Vol. 7, No. 1 According to the Maharishi, illness comes about when there is a lack of coordination between the body's inner intelligence and its outer expression. As with traditional Ayurveda, Maharishi Ayur Veda describes material creation according to panchamahābhūtas theory, in which the five elements of earth, air, fire, water and ether combine to form three doṣas: vāta, pitta and kapha.Cynthia Ann Humes, \\"Maharishi Ayur-Ved,\\" chapter 16 in The theory of both traditional and Maharishi Ayurveda is that the body's function is governed by the three doṣas, which designate body types and the physical and mental traits they typify. An individual's doṣa contains various combinations of vāta, pitta and kapha, which can vary with the seasons and time of day. Disease symptoms are attributed to imbalances in one's doṣa, which can be detected through pulse diagnosis or a questionnaire. Balance is achieved through a variety of products and procedures, many of which are specific to one's doṣa. Maharishi Ayur-Veda does not stray from these traditional common interpretations of doṣa. Maharishi Ayur Veda emerges from and consistently reflects the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, and is the upaveda of Atharva Veda.Cynthia Ann Humes, \\"Maharishi Ayur-Ved,\\" chapter 16 in \\"A history of Indian philosophy, Volume 2, Surendranath Dasgupta, Page 275 Maharishi Ayur Veda represents itself as representing the entirety of the Ayurvedic tradition.Cynthia Ann Humes, \\"Maharishi Ayur-Ved,\\" chapter 16 in \\" The practices of Maharishi Ayur-Veda are said to be authentic, though Francis Zimmerman says that they are biased toward gentleness, avoiding violent or painful treatments that were historically part of ayurveda in early India. He also says that Maharishi Ayur-Veda involves an ideological confusion of Ayurvedic categories.Francis Zimmermann, \\"Gentle Purge: The Flower Power of Āyurveda\\", chapter 9 in In 1985, Maharishi Ayurveda doctors met with outside consultants, who suggested that some traditional Ayurvedic remedies would not be accepted by American consumers. The principal difference between Maharishi Ayur-Veda and traditional Ayurveda is the emphasis on the role of consciousness and the use of Transcendental Meditation, as well as the highlighting of the need to express positive emotions and attuning one's life to the natural rhythms of the body. Maharishi Ayur Veda also holds that perfect health is a state present within every person, that can be chosen by the individual, and that the physical body is a portal to a \\"quantum mechanical body\\" that exists at the subatomic level where matter and energy are one, and that every organ and process in the body has a quantum equivalent. Tony Nader, called Maharajadhiraj Raja Ram, who is the Sovereign Ruler of the Global Country of World Peace, identifies this concept of \\"quantum healing\\" with the Maharishi's theories of Vedic Science. Individual metabolic differences and seasonal variations as described in MAV are an important part of a healthy diet. MAV considers taste and quality to be central features in the classification of foods, and seasonal factors as crucial in determining nutritional needs. MAV also advises use of certain herbal nutritional supplements to maintain optimum health.Nutritional Insights From Maharishi Ayurveda, Journal of Applied Nutrition, Vol. 48, Nos. 1 and 2, pp. 34–41, 1996, Hari M. Sharma, MD, FRCPC, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University Deepak Chopra, founding president of Maharishi Ayur-Veda Products International, Inc (MAPI), the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine and former medical director of the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center for Stress Management and Behavioral Medicine, says, according to Stephen Barrett in an article in the journal Alternative Medicine and Ethics, that \\"If you have happy thoughts, then you make happy molecules. On the other hand, if you have sad thoughts, and angry thoughts, and hostile thoughts, then you make those molecules which may depress the immune system and make you more susceptible to disease.\\" Barrett goes on to say that, while the TM technique and other relaxation techniques may temporarily relieve stress, claims made by Chopra that happy or sad thought may affect the molecular levels of the body and the immune system have no scientific basis. Reception According to the book Global and Modern Ayurveda, while Maharishi Ayur-Veda was instrumental in the popularization of Ayurveda in the 1980s and early 1990s, its role in global Ayurveda has now been marginalized. Authors Smith and Wujastyk attribute the virtual disappearance of MAV as an influence in global Ayurveda to the following factors: (i) isolating and describing itself as being authentic, thereby inferring that other forms of Ayurveda are \\"disbarred from legitimacy\\"; (ii) raising \\"its prices stratospherically\\" for its medicines and treatments, which placed it beyond the means of all but \\"the most committed and enthusiastic (and wealthy) followers\\"; and (iii) \\"become stridently opposed to allopathic medicine\\". In the same volume, Suzanne Newcombe cites criticism of the commercial nature of Maharishi Ayur-Veda, but says that \\"Maharishi Ayur-Veda is an important part of the practice of Ayurveda in contemporary society, despite the ideological claims of those who oppose the system.\\"Suzanne Newcombe, \\"Ayurvedic Medicine in Britain and the Epistemology of Practicing Medicine in \\"Good Faith\\",\\" chapter 15 in Smith and Wujastyk write that previously it was a requirement that MAV practitioners have a medical degree, but in 2005, all medical doctors with MAV training were replaced by Maharishi Ayurveda practitioners from India. Author Philip Goldberg writes that Maharishi Ayurveda \\"attracted attention\\" due to the \\"TM movement's aggressive promotion\\". Author Frederick M. Smith, in his book Modern and Global Ayurveda writes that in the U.K. \\"the Maharishi organization had a clear marketing plan and a full-time public relations officer up until at least 1992.\\" According to Andrew Skolnick writes in a 1991 JAMA article characterizes the TM movement's marketing of Maharishi Ayurveda as a \\"widespread pattern of misinformation, deception, and manipulation of lay and scientific news media.\\" These were seen as efforts to gain \\"scientific respectability\\". According to a JAMA article by Ralph Smith, a similar concern was raised in the 1980 book TM and Cult Mania. =Chalmers and Davis= In October 1991, the Professional Conduct Committee of the British General Medical Council found Roger Chalmers, Dean of Medicine of the unrecognized Maharishi University of Natural Law, Mentmore and Leslie Davis, Dean of Physiology at that institution, guilty of \\"Serious Professional Misconduct\\" in connection with their use of Maharishi Ayur-Veda for the treatment of AIDS and HIV, and ordered them erased from the List of Registered Medical Practitioners. (Chalmers was subsequently reinstated.Suzanne Newcombe, \\"Ayurvedic Medicine in Britain and the Epistemology of Practicing Medicine in \\"Good Faith\\",\\" chapter 15 in ) The Committee found, among other things, that there were no proper and approved clinical trials for the treatments, there was inadequate scientific evidence to support the treatments, that they were prescribing and that they had made false and misleading statements on the value of MAV in the treatment of HIV and AIDS and about the TM-affiliated \\"World Medical Association for Perfect Health\\". Independent tests of the pills prescribed by Chalmers and Davis showed that they had, at best, a negligible effect on HIV, but were 100,000 times more toxic than AZT. According to a 1990 report in The Independent regarding the accusations, the claim that Maharishi Ayurvedic has no side effects \\"appears to be inaccurate.\\" The article says that separate warnings had been issued in the past on side-effects of both Transcendental Meditation and the Maharishi Ayurvedic diet, such as a warning by the British Dietetic Association on the potential dangers of the Maharishi Ayurvedic diet to AIDS patients.Suzanne Newcombe, \\"Ayurvedic Medicine in Britain and the Epistemology of Practicing Medicine in \\"Good Faith\\",\\" chapter 15 in \\"Cult doctors investigated over herbal anti-AIDS pills\\", The Independent (19 August 1990)Press Release: The General Medical Council, London, England (25 October 1991). According to Suzanne Newcombe, alternative treatments often receive little attention in the U.K. and MAV was the focus of GMC only because the treatments involved AIDS patients, which she characterized as a vulnerable and controversial group at the time.Suzanne Newcombe, \\"Ayurvedic Medicine in Britain and the Epistemology of Practicing Medicine in \\"Good Faith\\",\\" chapter 15 in =Sharma and Chopra= In 1991, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published an article on the benefits of Maharishi Ayur-Veda titled \\"Letter from New Delhi: Maharishi Ayur-Veda: Modern Insights into Ancient Medicine,\\" authored by Hari Sharma, then of The Ohio State University College of Medicine and now of The Ohio State University College of Medicine's Center for Integrative Medicine, Brihaspati Dev Triguna, of the All India Ayur-Veda Congress, and Deepak Chopra, of the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine A subsequent article in JAMA by Andrew A. Skolnick alleged that the authors of the first article had not disclosed their financial ties with organizations that sell the products and services about which they wrote. The article also investigated the marketing practices surrounding Ayur-Veda products and services. It was alleged there was a \\"widespread pattern of misinformation, deception, and manipulation of lay and scientific news media\\". It challenged the Sharma et al. claim that Maharishi Ayur-Veda was more cost effective than standard medical care. Additionally, the article reported that in the late 1980s, herbal researcher Tony Nader, at the time a PhD candidate in neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had been criticized for misrepresenting his research promoting Maharishi Ayurveda Products International (MAPI) herbal products as being sponsored by MIT and Harvard. The article reported that Nader and David Orme-Johnson were criticized by the organizers of the Annual Meeting of the Society for Economic Botany, which was held at the University of Illinois in Chicago in June 1987. According to the organizers, Nader and Orme-Johnson submitted research abstracts for the conference, but the presentation that they made had little to do with the abstracts. Instead it was a promotion for the herbal remedies of MAPI and for Transcendental Meditation. The JAMA article quotes a former TM teacher and chair of the TM center in Washington, D.C., as saying that he had been told to deceive the media. A letter to the editor by Chopra and Sharma was published in JAMA in October 1991. Chopra and Sharma wrote that many of the criticisms they had received in letters to the editor were inflammatory and had depended heavily on emotional and unfounded charges, without sound scientific backing and few references. They went on to say that the criticisms were directed largely at the TM organization, rather than to the approaches of Maharishi Ayur-Veda. Andrew Skolnick, in a letter to the editor of JAMA, says Chopra and Sharma did not deny and made no apology that they had concealed from JAMA their financial ties to organizations selling and marketing the products and services about which they wrote, and claimed to have no such conflicts of interest on their signed author's form. Skolnick later published an account of how JAMA was deceived. The journal Science summarized the issue as \\"an ugly episode that has implications for all scientific journals and for scientists who could possibly be construed as having a conflict of interest\\". JAMA gets into an Indian herbal jam: three authors who wrote about traditional Indian healing have conflicts of interest, the journal finds. (Journal of the American Medical Association; Hari Sharma, Deepak Chopra, Brihaspati Dev Triguna) 1991 In response, two TM organizations then headed by Deepak Chopra sued Skolnick, JAMA's editor George Lundberg, and the AMA in 1992, seeking an injunction and $194 million in damages. The suit alleged Skolnick's news report on TM's health care products and services was libelous and that it tortuously interfered with their business interests. In August 1992, in a noted decision, the trial court rejected the plaintiff’s motion to enjoin JAMA and Skolnick under the Illinois Deceptive Practices Act from publishing statements about them and Maharishi Ayurveda, observing that the plaintiffs did not allege that the statements about them had been false or misleading, and holding that \\"plaintiffs have little likelihood of prevailing on the merits of their disparagement claim\\", and that JAMA’s and Skolnick’s alleged defamatory statements were protected as \\"fair comment and criticism\\" on an issue of public concern.Current Developments in Media Libel and Invasion of Privacy Law, Libel Defense Resource Center Vol 11 p 558 (1994)Communications Law, Vol 2 (1994), Practicing Law Institute p 497Lancaster Foundation v Skolnick 21 Media Law Reporter, 1021 (ND Ill 1992) Shortly thereafter, the case was dismissed without prejudice in March 1993.The Lancaster Foundation, Inc., The American Association for Ayur-Vedic Medicine, Inc. vs. Andrew A.

Philip Goldberg's 2010 book American Veda says that the lawsuit was settled in 1993. =Flint= In 1994, Jonie Flint sued Chopra, the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Health Center in Palo Alto California and Brihaspati Dev Triguna over her husband David's death from leukemia. Two months following a visit to the center at which a primordial sound treatment was prescribed by Chopra, Triguna declared Flint cured of leukemia. Flint followed other Maharishi Ayur-Veda treatments at Triguna's directions over a period of nine months, at a cost of more than $10,000, but died of leukemia. Flint was assisted in filing her lawsuit by the National Council Against Health Fraud. Chopra's attorneys said that the suit against him would be dismissed before trial. They said that David Flint was desperate and that Chopra saw him for 45 minutes for spiritual counsel and gave him a primordial sound technique. They also said that Flint signed a form saying that he understood that sound therapy wasn't a substitute for conventional therapies, and that the form Flint signed also absolved Chopra and his organization of responsibility in the event the treatment was unsuccessful.

Paparazzi tend to make a living by selling their photographs to media outlets that focus on tabloid journalism and sensationalism (such as gossip magazines).  Description  Paparazzi tend to be independent contractors, unaffiliated with mainstream media organizations, and photos taken are usually done so by taking advantage of opportunities when they have sightings of high- profile people they are tracking. Some experts have described the behavior of paparazzi as synonymous with stalking, and anti-stalking bills in many countries address the issue by reducing harassment of public figures and celebrities, especially with their children. Some public figures and celebrities have expressed concern at the extent to which paparazzi go to invade their personal space. The filing and receiving of judicial support for restraining orders against paparazzi has increased, as have lawsuits with judgments against them.  Famous paparazzi  Walter Santesso portrays Paparazzo in the 1960 film La Dolce Vita, marking the character as the eponym of the word paparazzi. Ron Galella is most known for suing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis after the former First Lady ordered her Secret Service agents to destroy Galella’s camera and film following an encounter in New York City's Central Park in the early 1970s. Rino Barillari is an Italian paparazzo known as the \\"King of the Paparazzi\\" in Italy. He was awarded the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 1998.  Etymology  A news photographer named Paparazzo (played by Walter Santesso in the 1960 film La Dolce Vita directed by Federico Fellini) is the eponym of the word paparazzi. As Fellini said in his interview to Time magazine, \\"Paparazzo ... suggests to me a buzzing insect, hovering, darting, stinging.\\" Those versions of the word's origin are sometimes contested. For example, in the Abruzzo dialect spoken by Ennio Flaiano, co-scriptwriter of La Dolce Vita, the term paparazzo refers to the local clam, Venerupis decussata, and is also used as a metaphor for the shutter of a camera lens. Further, in an interview with Fellini's screenwriter Flaiano, he said the name came from the book Sulla riva dello Jonio (1957), a translation by Italian poet Margherita Guidacci of By the Ionian Sea, a 1901 travel narrative in southern Italy by Victorian writer George Gissing. He further states that either Fellini or Flaiano opened the book at random, saw the name of a restaurant owner, Coriolano Paparazzo, and decided to use it for the photographer. This story is further documented by a variety of Gissing scholars and in the book A Sweet and Glorious Land. Revisiting the Ionian Sea. By the late 1960s, the word, usually in the Italian plural form paparazzi, had entered English as a generic term for intrusive photographers. A person who has been photographed by the paparazzi is said to have been \\"papped\\". = In other languages = A transliteration of paparazzi is used in several languages that do not use the Latin alphabet, including Japanese (), Korean (), Ukrainian, Russian (), Thai and Hebrew. Chinese uses , meaning \\"puppy squad\\". Khmer uses (anak bramanh roub).  Legality  Due to the reputation of paparazzi as a nuisance, several states and countries restrict their activities by passing laws and curfews, and by staging events in which paparazzi are specifically not allowed to take photographs. In the United States, celebrity news organizations are protected by the First Amendment. To protect the children of celebrities, California passed Senate Bill No. 606 in September 2013. The purpose of the bill is to stop paparazzi from taking pictures of children or wards in a harassing manner because of their parent's occupation. This law increased the penalty for harassment of children. California Civil Code sections 1708.7 and 1708.8 explicitly address stalking and invasion of physical privacy. = Injunctions = photojournalists often known as paparazzi In 1972, paparazzo photographer Ron Galella sued Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis after the former First Lady ordered her Secret Service agents to destroy Galella's camera and film following an encounter in New York City's Central Park. Kennedy counter-sued claiming harassment. The trial lasted three weeks and became a groundbreaking case regarding photojournalism and the role of paparazzi. In Galella v. Onassis, Kennedy obtained a restraining order to keep Galella away from her and her children. The restriction later was dropped to . The trial is a focal point in Smash His Camera, a 2010 documentary film by director Leon Gast. In 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed were killed in a limousine crash as their driver was speeding, trying to escape paparazzi. An inquest jury investigated the involvement of paparazzi in the incident, and although several paparazzi were taken into custody, no one was convicted. The official inquests into the accident attributed the causes to the speed and manner of driving of the Mercedes, as well as the following vehicles, and the impairment of the judgment of the Mercedes driver, Henri Paul, through alcohol. In 1999, the Oriental Daily News of Hong Kong was found guilty of \\"scandalizing the court\\", an extremely rare law that the newspaper's conduct would undermine confidence in the administration of justice. The charge was brought after the newspaper had published abusive articles challenging the judiciary's integrity and accusing it of bias in a lawsuit the paper had instigated over a photo of a pregnant Faye Wong. The paper had also arranged for a \\"dog team\\" (slang for paparazzi in the Chinese language) to track a judge for 72 hours, to provide the judge with first-hand experience of what paparazzi do. Time magazine's Style & Design special issue in 2005 ran a story entitled \\"Shooting Star\\", in which Mel Bouzad, one of the top paparazzi in Los Angeles at the time, claimed to have made US$150,000 for a picture of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez in Georgia after their breakup. \\"If I get a picture of Britney and her baby,\\" Bouzad claimed, \\"I'll be able to buy a house in those hills (above Sunset Boulevard).\\" Paparazzi author Peter Howe told Time that \\"celebrities need a higher level of exposure than the rest of us so it is a two-way street. The celebrities manipulate.\\" In 2006, Daniella Cicarelli went through a scandal when a paparazzo caught video footage of her having sex with her boyfriend on a beach in Spain, which was posted on YouTube.Justiça mantém liminar que obriga sites a tirar vídeo de Cicarelli com namorado do ar After fighting in the court, it was decided in her favor, causing YouTube to be blocked in Brazil. This caused major havoc among Brazilians, including threatening a boycott against MTV Brasil unless Cicarelli was fired from that company. The block only lasted a few days, and Cicarelli was not dismissed. The legal action backfired as the court decided she had no expectation of privacy by having sex in a public location. The E! network program Celebrities Uncensored used often-confrontational footage of celebrities made by paparazzi. Following the publication of photographs showing Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge sunbathing whilst topless at her husband's cousin's (Viscount Linley's) holiday home in France, it was announced on September 14, 2012, that the Royal couple were to launch legal action against the French edition of Closer magazine. It was the first time that a senior royal has sued in a court outside the UK. The reason cited for the legal action is that the Duchess had a right of privacy whilst at the home—the magazine responded that the pictures had been taken from the public highway. The injunction was granted September 18, 2012 and the publishers of the magazine were ordered not to publish the photographs in France and not to sell the images. The publishers were also ordered to hand over the original material of the published pictures under threat of a €10,000 fine for every day delay in doing so. In the United Kingdom, Sienna Miller, Amy Winehouse, and Lily Allen won injunctions that prevent the paparazzi from following them and gathering outside their houses. Miller was awarded £53,000. In 2013, rapper Kanye West, facing assault charges for attacking a photojournalist, said he would fight to get the law changed so celebrities can profit from paparazzis' work. = Other measures = In addition to filing injunctions, celebrities have taken other measures to avoid paparazzi. When Daniel Radcliffe was performing in the play Equus in London, he often wore the same hat and jacket every day to make the photos \\"unpublishable\\". Taylor Swift walked backwards on a trail to avoid paparazzi.

It was issued to journalists on 3 February 2003 by Alastair Campbell, Blair's Director of Communications and Strategy, and concerned Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. Along with the earlier September Dossier, these documents were ultimately used by the British government to justify its involvement in the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Dossier The term Dodgy Dossier was first coined by online polemical magazine Spiked in relation to the September Dossier. The term was later employed by Channel 4 News when its reporter, Julian Rush, Article includes link to video clip of the associated Channel 4 News television programme. was made aware of Glen Rangwala's discovery that much of the work in the Iraq Dossier had been plagiarised from various unattributed sources including a thesis produced by a student at California State University. The most notable source was an article by then graduate student Ibrahim al-Marashi, entitled Iraq's Security and Intelligence Network: A Guide and Analysis. Whole sections of Marashi's writings on \\"Saddam's Special Security Organisation\\" were repeated verbatim including typographical errors, while certain amendments were made to strengthen the tone of the alleged findings (e.g., \\"monitoring foreign embassies in Iraq\\" became \\"spying on foreign embassies in Iraq\\", and \\"aiding opposition groups in hostile regimes\\" became \\"supporting terrorist organisations in hostile regimes\\"). In its opening paragraph the briefing document claimed that it drew \\"upon a number of sources, including intelligence material.\\" Before the document's release it had been praised by Tony Blair and United States Secretary of State Colin Powell as further intelligence and quality research. The day after Channel 4's exposé, Blair's office issued a statement admitting that a mistake was made in not crediting its sources, but did not concede that the quality of the document's content was affected. The claims contained in the September and 'Iraq' Dossiers were called into question when weapons of mass destruction (WMD) were not found in Iraq, and the dossiers were encompassed by House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee inquiry. The Committee subsequently reported that the sources should have been credited, and that the dossier should have been checked by ministers before being released. The dossier had only been reviewed by a group of civil servants operating under Alastair Campbell. The committee stated that the publication was \\"almost wholly counter-productive\\" and in the event only served to undermine the credibility of the government's case. The controversy over the Iraq Dossier was mentioned frequently in the government's conflict with the BBC over the claim in the September Dossier that Iraq could deploy biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so, and the controversy surrounding the death of Dr. David Kelly. Andrew Gilligan, the BBC journalist who wrote a report which claimed that the September Dossier had been deliberately exaggerated, stated before the Hutton Inquiry that recalling the February Dossier had led him to file his report based on his interview with Dr. Kelly without seeking confirmation from other sources. Whether or not the September Dossier was inconsistent with the original intelligence, it was altered in ways that made it inconsistent with itself. Based on analysis submitted to the Iraq Inquiry. See: Jones, Brian (2009) \\"Dossier demolished\\", Iraq Inquiry Digest website. The dossier became a point of amusement in British politics. During one Prime Minister's Questions, Michael Howard (then leader of the Opposition), informed Blair, \\"I have got a great big dossier on his past and I haven't even had to sex it up.\\" The term \\"Dodgy Dossier\\" was used again in January 2017, in reference to the \\"Steele Dossier\\" on a supposed sex scandal involving US President Donald Trump.

It was established as the National Conifer Collection in 1925 and is now recognised as the most complete collection of conifers on one site anywhere in the world. The collection has over 10,000 trees growing across , including rare, endangered and historically important specimens. Bedgebury National Pinetum conducts conservation work and is home to some 56 vulnerable or critically endangered species and houses five NCCPG National Plant Collections. History Bedgebury is first mentioned in an Anglo-Saxon charter in AD 841, the name deriving from the Old English bycgan, meaning \\"buy\\", and the Kentish , meaning \\"to bend or turn\\", possibly in reference to a stream. John de Bedgebury is listed as the earliest resident of Bedgebury, in the time of Edward II. In the 15th century Agnes de Bedgebury, sister and heir of John (died 1424) married John Colepeper,Thomas Downes Wilmot Dearn, An historical, topographical and descriptive account of the Weald of Kent 1814:97. whose Colepeper heirs, financed by mining clay- ironstone on the estate, were resident until at the time of the restoration of Charles II, and who created an ornamental park on the Bedgebury estate. Elizabeth I visited in August 1573. The current house was built in 1688 for Sir James Hayes, a little apart from the old house. The estate later passed to the Stephenson family, who retained it until it was left to a Miss Peach, who sold it in 1789 to John Cartier, Governor of Bengal and High Sheriff of Kent, who improved the plantings and the house.Dearn 1814. In the 1840s Viscount William Beresford developed the estate by creating the village of Kilndown and three lodges, one of which – Keepers Lodge, now known as Park House – became the centre of the Pinetum. Beresford initiated the pinetum in the 1850s and his successor, his stepson Alexander Beresford Hope, developed Lady Mildred's Drive to enable visitors in carriages to view the trees. The estate was sold in 1899 to Isaac Lewis, who allowed the collection to fall into neglect, and it was purchased by the Crown Estate in 1918 for its marshy land and drier ridges, as well as its streams, lakes and valleys. In 1919, the house was bought by the Church Education Corporation to operate as a school. The school closed in 2006.Country Seat blog http://countryhouses.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/schools-out-seats-of-learning- for-sale/ The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the Forestry Commission established the site as The National Pinetum in a joint venture in 1924, as the National Conifer Collection, because air pollution was rendering London unsuitable for growing conifers. A site at the southern end of Bedgebury Park was chosen, centred on Marshall's Lake and a stream-filled valley. The first plants for the pinetum were raised at Kew Gardens in 1921 and transferred to Bedgebury in 1925 and 1926, alongside Viscount Beresford's existing plantings. Development of the collection was managed by the Kew botanist William Dallimore, a world-renowned expert on conifers. In 1969 management of the pinetum reverted solely to the Forestry Commission, who extended it in 1977 and created two new lakes. In the Great Storm of 1987 almost a quarter of the trees were brought down. The collection Marshall's Lake. The aim of Bedgebury National Pinetum is \\"to grow as many species of conifers as the climatic conditions will allow, planted in generic groupings, using geographically associated plantings where possible.\\" (W. Dallimore, 1923) The pinetum holds 10,000 specimens of conifers and other species that grow in temperate zones, including 7,000 trees, as living gene banks and as a genetic resource for future restoration programmes. It holds 2,300 different species of conifer, specimens of which include the tallest tree in Kent (Abies grandis) and the three tallest Leyland Cypresses in the UK. The plan is for the pinetum to provide a mix of 70% conifers to 30% broadleaves, and to leave 40% of the site open to provide vistas and allow the trees to be appreciated. Bedgebury National Pinetum is home to six NCCPG National Plant Collections: Yew, Juniper, Thuja, Lawson's Cypress, Leyland Cypress and Cryptomeria japonica. The collection contains 56 species that have been officially declared vulnerable or critically endangered. Conservation Conifers at Bedgebury National Pinetum. The scale and quality of Bedgebury National Pinetum's conifer collection have made it an ideal site to take part in the International Conifer Conservation Programme (ICCP), run by the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. The ICCP aims to promote the conservation of conifers through conservation work, research and education, and work carried out at Bedgebury makes up part of the effort to conserve the genetic diversity of conifers, particularly those from temperate forests. The Bedgebury Conifer Conservation Project, initiated in 2007, is designed to use redundant forest plots to grow large numbers – up to 500 – of endangered conifers to provide an ex-situ genetic resource. The first plots were planted with Chilean plum yew by Boy Scouts celebrating their centenary in 2007, and future plantings will include samples from Europe, Asia, North America and Australasia.

The colony derived its title from the names of Agrippina and her husband, the emperor Claudius, and received the name Colonia Claudia Ara Augusta Agrippinensium, which is the origin of the city's modern name, Cologne. Alongside the allotment of land to veterans, the existing town of Ara Ubiorum was elevated to the status of a colonia, which would have conferred many privileges on the inhabitants.Barrett, Anthony A.

This movement included the Usipetes and Tencteri tribes, who wished to relocate to avoid contact with the Suevi. Caesar, concerned that fighting might break out in the region and draw troops away from his planned invasion, marched toward the Rhine. He met with ambassadors from the Germanic tribe and offered them land with the Ubii and an alliance against the Suevi; however, Caesar soon became worried that the tribes were delaying until their cavalry could return. Together with the Batavi, the Ubii furnished soldiers for the Germanic bodyguard, the personal bodyguard of the early Roman emperors.

Born in Huehuetenango, he was a dictator who took power as a result of a coup d'état on March 23, 1982.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/obituaries/efrain- rios-montt-guatemala-dead.html He was overthrown by his defense minister, Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores, in another coup d'état on August 8, 1983. In the 2003 presidential elections, Ríos Montt unsuccessfully ran as the candidate of the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG). In 2007 he returned to public office as a member of Congress, thereby gaining prosecutorial immunity. He was protected from a pair of long-running lawsuits alleging war crimes against him and a number of his former ministers and counselors during their term in the presidential palace in 1982-83. His immunity ended on January 14, 2012, with the end of his term in legislative office. On January 26, 2012, he appeared in court in Guatemala and was formally indicted for genocide and crimes against humanity. Background Ríos Montt enrolled in the Military Academy of Guatemala in 1946. He attended the School of the Americas in 1951. In 1954, the young officer played a minor role in the successful CIA-organized coup against President Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán. Following the coup, Ríos Montt rose swiftly through the army ranks, becoming deputy chief of staff in 1968. In 1970, under the military regime of President General Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio, he was promoted to brigadier general and chief of staff of Guatemalan Army. In 1973, Ríos Montt resigned from his post at the Washington embassy to participate in the March 1974 presidential elections as the candidate of the National Opposition Front (FNO). He lost the election to a rival right-wing candidate, General Kjell Eugenio Laugerud García, by 70,000 votes. Since Laugerud didn't get a majority, the election was thrown to the government- controlled National Congress, which promptly elected Laugerud. According to some accounts, Ríos Montt appeared to be on his way to a majority when the government abruptly halted the count and manipulated the results to make it appear Laugerud had won by a narrow plurality. Ríos Montt denounced a \\"massive electoral fraud\\", blaming his defeat on a conspiracy from the Catholic Church and the Mayan minority. Ríos Montt especially viewed Catholic priests as leftist agents who had questioned the mistreatment of the Catholic Mayas. Ríos Montt resolved and stated that \\"he would one day even the score.\\" It is alleged that he was given a payoff of several hundred thousand dollars along with the post of military attaché in the embassy in Madrid, Spain, where he stayed until retiring in 1977. In 1978, he left the Roman Catholic Church and joined a Guatemalan offshoot of the Gospel Outreach Church of Eureka, California, an evangelical Protestant sect Efrain Rios Montt, former Guatemalan military dictator charged with genocide, dies at 91, The Washington Post, John Otis, April 1, 2018. Retrieved April 2, 2018., National Security Archive, The George Washington University, Accessed 29 March 2013 later Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson became personal friends. Ríos Montt joined the movement and assumed the role of becoming a teacher of the religion. Ríos Montt's brother Mario Enrique Ríos Montt is a Catholic bishop, and in 1998 succeeded the assassinated Bishop Juan Gerardi as head of the human rights commission uncovering the truth of the disappearances associated with the military and his brother. Military regime =1982 coup= On March 7, 1982, General Ángel Aníbal Guevara, the official party candidate, won the presidential election, universally denounced as fraudulent by opposition parties. On March 23, with the support of fellow soldiers General Horacio Egberto Maldonado Schaad and Colonel Francisco Luis Gordillo Martínez, Ríos Montt deposed General Romeo Lucas García in a coup d'état and seized power, an act which the United States had not foreseen. The trio set up a military junta with Ríos Montt at its head. The junta immediately declared martial law and suspended the constitution, shut down the legislature, set up secret tribunals, and began a campaign against political dissidents that included kidnapping, torture, and extrajudicial assassinations. The coup was described as being composed of Oficiales jóvenes (\\"young officers\\"). It prevented the scheduled July 1, 1982 installation of Guevara as president. Ríos Montt was the change that some had sought as his tough approach sought to end corruption, and brought forth his vision of “education, nationalism, an end to want and hunger, and a sense of civic pride” was what some believed Guatemala needed. Because of repeated vote-rigging and the blatant corruption of the military establishment, the coup was initially welcomed. At first there was some expectation that the extremely poor human rights and security situation might improve under the new regime. In April 1982, U.S. Ambassador Frederick Chapin declared that thanks to the coup of Ríos Montt, \\"the Guatemalan government has come out of the darkness and into the light.\\"(Clair Apodaca. Understanding US human rights policy. CRC Press, 2006) Drawing on his Pentecostal beliefs, Ríos Montt invoked a modern apocalyptic vision comparing the four riders of the Book of Revelation to the four modern evils of hunger, misery, ignorance and subversion, as well as fighting corruption and what he described as the depredations of the rich. He said the true Christian had the Bible in one hand and a machine gun in the other. On April 10, he launched the National Growth and Security Plan whose stated goals were to end the extermination and teach the populace about nationalism. They wanted to integrate the campesinos and indigenous peoples into the state, declaring that because of their illiteracy and \\"immaturity\\" they were particularly vulnerable to the seductions of \\"international communism.\\" Ríos Montt's changes sparked a number of guerilla factions which then created a guerilla group known as the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity organization (URNG). Ríos Montt's military junta then began to intensify their efforts and on April 20, 1982 launched an operation known as Victoria 82. Victoria 82 sought first to destroy guerilla bases and forces through counter-insurgency efforts which were \\"scorched earth\\" tactics. The plan was most known for its solution to reduce the numbers of the indigenous Mayan people in Guatemala. Frijoles y fusiles On June 9, the other two members of the junta were forced to resign, leaving Ríos Montt as the sole leader, head of the armed forces, and minister of defense. Violence escalated in the countryside under the Guatemalan military's Plan Victoria 82, which included a rural pacification strategy known as frijoles y fusiles (beans and guns). This was an attempt by Ríos Montt to win over the large insurgent groups to his version of the rule of the law, unleashing a scorched earth campaign on the nation's Maya population, particularly in the departments of Quiché and Huehuetenango, that, according to the 1999 United Nations truth commission, resulted in the annihilation of nearly 600 villages. One example was the Plan de Sánchez massacre in Rabinal, Baja Verapaz, in July 1982, which saw over 250 people killed. The administration established special military courts that had the power to impose death penalties against criminals and suspected guerrillas. Tens of thousands of peasant farmers fled over the border into southern Mexico. Meanwhile, urban areas saw a period of relative calm. The June 1982 amnesty for political prisoners was replaced by a state of siege in the following month that limited the activities of political parties and labor unions under the threat of death by firing squad. In 1982, an Amnesty International report estimated that over 10,000 indigenous Guatemalans and peasant farmers were killed from March to July of that year, and that 100,000 rural villagers were forced to flee their homes. According to more recent estimates, tens of thousands of non-combatants were killed by the regime's death squads in the subsequent eighteen months. At the height of the bloodshed under Ríos Montt, reports put the number of disappearances and killings at more than 3,000 per month. =US and Israeli backing= Given Ríos Montt's staunch anticommunism and ties to the United States, the Reagan administration continued to support the general and his regime, with the U.S. president paying a visit to Guatemala City in December 1982.Richard Allen Greene. Critics question Reagan legacy. BBC News, June 9, 2004 During a meeting with Ríos Montt on December 4, Reagan declared: \\"President Ríos Montt is a man of great personal integrity and commitment. ... I know he wants to improve the quality of life for all Guatemalans and to promote social justice.\\" President Ronald Reagan claimed Guatemala's human rights conditions were improving and used this to justify several major shipments of military hardware to Ríos Montt; $4 million in helicopter spare parts and $6.3 million in additional military supplies in 1982 and 1983 respectively. The decision was taken in spite of records concerning human rights violations, and also bypassed seeking approval from the U. S. Congress. Meanwhile, a then-secret 1983 CIA cable noted a rise in \\"suspect right-wing violence\\" and an increasing number of bodies \\"appearing in ditches and gullies.\\"National Security Archive. February 1983. [Ríos Montt Gives Carte Blanche to Archivos to Deal with Insurgency] CIA, secret cable In turn, Guatemala was eager to resurrect the Central American Defense Council, defunct since 1969, to join forces with the right- wing governments of El Salvador and Honduras in retaliations against the leftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua. Like Guatemala's other suppliers of arms, Israel (which had been supplying arms to Guatemala since 1974) continued its aid provisions. The cooperation did not just involve material support, but also included providing intelligence and operational training, carried out both in Israel and in Guatemala. In 1982, Ríos Montt told ABC News that his success was due to the fact that \\"our soldiers were trained by Israelis.\\" There was not much outcry in Israel at the time about its involvement in Guatemala, though the support for Ríos Montt was no secret. The Israeli link was not lost on the average Guatemalan: at a cemetery in Chichicastenango, relatives of a man killed by the military told Perera, \\"In church they tell us that divine justice is on the side of the poor; but the fact of the matter is, it is the military who get the Israeli guns.\\" =Removal by coup= By the end of 1982, Ríos Montt, claiming that the war against the leftist guerrillas had been won, said the government's work was one of \\"techo, trabajo, y tortillas\\" (\\"roofs, work, and tortillas\\"). Three coups had been attempted since he came to power. On June 29, 1983, he declared a state of emergency, and announced elections for July 1984. On August 8, his own Minister of Defense General Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores overthrew the regime in a coup (during which seven people were killed). The unpopularity of Ríos Montt was widespread, exacerbated by his refusal to grant clemency to six guerrillas during the visit of Pope John Paul II. The military was offended by his promotion of young officers in defiance of the Army's traditional hierarchy. Many citizens in the middle class were alienated by his decision on August 1 to introduce the value-added tax, never before levied in Guatemala. The killings continued even after Ríos Montt was eased from office in 1983.Guatemala: Memoria del Silencio, Comision para Esclarecimiento Historico It has been documented that as many as one and a half million Maya peasants were uprooted from their homes, and that many were forced to live in re- education concentration camps and to work in the fields of Guatemalan land barons. The Maya Indian and campesino population suffered greatly under Ríos Montt's government. Ríos Montt along with several other men who served high positions in the military governments of the early 1980s were defendants in several lawsuits alleging genocide and crimes against humanity; one of these cases was filed in 1999 by Nobel Peace Prize-winning K'iche'-Maya activist, Rigoberta Menchú. Center for Justice and Accountability: human rights lawyers prosecuting the Spanish case In early 2008 the presiding judge, Santiago Pedraz, took testimony from a number of indigenous survivors. The genocide cases saw little progress due to a climate of ongoing and entrenched impunity in Guatemala. Information about the UN commission to investigate impunity in Guatemala: CICIG Attempted political comeback Ríos Montt founded the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG) political party in 1989. He tried to run for president in 1990, but was prohibited from entering the race by the constitutional court due to a constitutional provision banning people who had participated in military coups from becoming president. He was an FRG congressman between 1990 and 2004. In 1994, he was elected president of the unicameral legislature. He tried to run again in 1995, and was also barred from the race. Future president Alfonso Portillo was named to replace him as the FRG candidate, and narrowly lost. Guatemalan campaigners on behalf of Maya survivors of the civil war, such as Nobel laureate and Maya human rights advocate Rigoberta Menchú, were amazed, in March 1999, when U.S. President Bill Clinton apologised for U.S. support of Ríos Montt's regime. Clinton declared: \\"For the United States, it is important I state clearly that support for military forces and intelligence units which engaged in violence and widespread repression was wrong and the United States must not repeat that mistake.\\" The same August President Portillo admitted involvement of the Guatemalan government in human rights abuses over the previous 20 years, including for two massacres that took place during Ríos Montt's presidency. The first was in Plan de Sánchez, in Baja Verapaz, with 268 dead, and in Dos Erres in Petén, where 200 people were murdered. =2003 presidential candidate= The FRG nominated Ríos Montt, in May 2003, for the November presidential election, but his candidacy was initially, and once again, rejected by the electoral registry and by two lower courts. In July 2003, Guatemala's highest court, which had had several judges appointed from the FRG, overruled the lower courts and allowed Ríos Montt to run for president. Over the years, he'd claimed the ban on former dictators making a bid for the presidency had been written specifically to prevent him from standing. Later, the Supreme Court suspended his campaign for the presidency and agreed to hear a complaint brought by two right-of-center parties that the general was constitutionally barred from running for the presidency. Ríos Montt denounced the ruling as judicial manipulation and, in a radio address, called on his followers to take to the streets to protest this decision. On July 24, in a day known as jueves negro (black Thursday) thousands of masked FRG supporters invaded the streets of Guatemala City armed with machetes, clubs and guns. They had been bussed in from all over the country by the FRG amidst claims that people working in FRG-controlled municipalities were being blackmailed with being sacked if they did not attend the demonstration. The demonstrators blocked traffic, chanted threatening slogans, and waved their machetes about. They were led by well known FRG militants, including several known congressmen, who were photographed by the press early in the morning while co- ordinating the actions, and the personal secretary of Zury Ríos Montt, the general's daughter. Indeed, a picture of a prominent FRG congressman adjusting his mask to talk on his cell phone was seen around the world. The demonstrators marched on the courts, the opposition parties headquarters, and newspapers, torching buildings, shooting out windows and burning cars and tires in the streets. A television journalist, Héctor Fernando Ramírez, died of a heart attack running away from a mob. After two days of wreaking havoc on the main streets of Guatemala City, rioters disbanded when an audio recording of Ríos Montt was played in loudspeakers calling them to return to their homes. The situation was so chaotic over the weekend that both the UN mission and the U.S. embassy were closed. Following the rioting, the Constitutional Court, packed with allies of Ríos Montt and Portillo, overturned the Supreme Court decision. The legal reasoning behind the final decision was not immediately made public. However, Ríos Montt had argued that the ban on coup leaders, formalized in the 1985 Constitution, could not be applied retroactively to acts before that date. Many Guatemalans expressed anger over the Court's decision. In the post-Cold War environment, U.S. support for Ríos Montt had subsided. In June 2003, the State Department publicly announced that it would prefer to deal with a less tarnished figure. Additionally, his standing in opinion polls dwindled in the wake of the riots and never recovered. During tense but peaceful presidential elections held on November 9, 2003, Ríos Montt received just 11 percent of the votes, putting him a distant third behind businessman Óscar Berger, head of the conservative Grand National Alliance (GANA), and Álvaro Colom of the National Unity of Hope (UNE). As he was required to give up his seat in Congress to run for president, his 14-year tenure there ended as well. In March 2004, a court order forbade Ríos Montt from leaving the country to see if he was eligible for trial on charges related to jueves negro and the death of Ramírez. On November 20, 2004, Ríos Montt had to ask permission to travel to his country home for the wedding of his daughter Zury Ríos Montt, to U.S. Representative Jerry Weller (a Republican from Illinois). But Ríos Montt had not at this point been charged with any crime and, on January 31, 2006, manslaughter charges for the death of Ramírez were dropped against Ríos Montt. Charges of crimes against humanity Two Truth Commissions, the REMHI report, sponsored by the Roman Catholic Church, and the CEH report, conducted by the United Nations as part of the 1996 Accords of Firm and Durable Peace, documented widespread human rights abuses committed by Ríos Montt's military regime. These included widespread massacres, rapes, and torture against the indigenous population in what has been called a Guatemalan genocide. Ríos Montt said there was no government-ordered genocide, and that abuses were only the result of a long, violent civil war. During his time as president, he had close ties to the United States, receiving direct and indirect support from several of its agencies, including the CIA. Ríos Montt's military regime was held accountable for constraining the guerrillas through what was known as the \\"guns and beans\\" campaign, telling the people \\"If you are with us, we’ll feed you, if not, we’ll kill you.\\" Guatemala's 36-year civil war only ended with the signing of a peace treaty in 1996. The civil war pitted Marxist rebels against the Guatemalan state, including the army. Huge numbers of civilians, both indigenous Mayas and mestizo Ladinos, were caught in the crossfire. Up to 200,000 Guatemalans were declared missing or killed during the conflict, making it one of Latin America's most violent wars. Indigenous Mayas suffered disproportionately during Ríos Montt's rule. It is documented that his government deliberately targeted thousands of indigenous people since many were suspected of harboring sympathies for, supporting, or participating in the guerrilla movement. Under the Cold War-era strategy of containment the Guatemalan state sought to eliminate the spread of Communism inside its borders. The UN-backed Historical Clarification Commission found that the resulting counterinsurgency campaign, significantly designed and advanced during Ríos Montt's presidency, included deliberate \\"acts of genocide\\" against the indigenous population. On 28 January 2013, judge Miguel Angel Galves opened a pre-trial hearing against Ríos Montt and retired General José Mauricio Rodríguez Sánchez for genocide and crimes against humanity, in particular the killings of 1,771 Maya Ixil Indians, including children.

The Guardian. 25 August 2015. =In Spain= In 1999, Guatemalan Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Menchú presented charges for torture, genocide, illegal detention and state-sponsored terrorism against Ríos Montt and four other retired Guatemalan generals, two of them ex-presidents. Three other civilians that were high government official between 1978 and 1982 were also indicted. The Center for Justice and Accountability and Asociación Pro Derechos Humanos de España are co-counsel in the trial. In September 2005 Spain's Constitutional Court ruled that Spanish courts can try those accused of crimes against humanity even if the victims were not of Spanish origin. In June 2006, Spanish judge Santiago Pedraz traveled to Guatemala to interrogate Ríos Montt and the others named in the case. At least 15 appeals filed by the defense attorneys of the indicted prevented him from carrying out the inquiries. On July 7, Pedraz issued an international arrest warrant against Efraín Ríos Montt and former presidents Óscar Humberto Mejía Victores and Romeo Lucas García (the latter of whom had died in May 2006 in Venezuela). A warrant was also issued for the retired generals Benedicto Lucas García and Aníbal Guevara. Former minister of the interior Donaldo Álvarez Ruiz, who remains at large, and ex- chiefs of police German Chupina Barahona and Pedro García Arredondo are also named on the international arrest warrants. For his part, Ríos Montt admitted in a July 2006 press conference that there were \\"excesses\\" committed by the army during his rule, but strenuously denied his culpability. =In Guatemala= On January 17, 2007, Ríos Montt announced that he would run for a seat in Congress in the election to be held later in the year. As a member of Congress he would again be immune from prosecution unless a court suspended him from office. He won his seat in the election, which was held on September 9, and led the FRG's 15-member congressional delegation in the new legislature. His immunity ended on January 14, 2012, when his term in office ran out. On January 26, 2012, Ríos Montt appeared in court in Guatemala City and was formally indicted by Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz for genocide and crimes against humanity, along with three other former generals. During the court hearing he refused to comment. The court released him on bail, but placed him under house arrest pending commencement of his trial.Former Guatemalan dictator Efrain Ríos Montt faces trial for genocide The Christian Science Monitor, January 27, 2012Guatemala ex-leader Rios Montt to face genocide charge BBC News, January 27, 2012 On March 1, 2012, a judge declined to grant Ríos Montt amnesty from genocide charges, paving the way for a trial.\\"Judge denies former Guatemalan dictator amnesty\\" CNN, March 1, 2012 This marked the first time a former head of state was tried for genocide in his home country. On 19 March 2013, his trial for the genocide of at least 1,771 members of the Maya Ixils began. But the trial was suspended by Judge Carol Patricia Flores following a directive from the Supreme Court on 19 April 2013. The judge ordered the legal process to be set back to November 2011, before the retired general was charged with war crimes. A judge annulled the genocide trial in April 2013, a ruling that might have forced prosecutors to begin the case all over again.Judge in Guatemala Annuls Genocide Trial of Ex- Dictator April 19, 2013 The New York Times Efraín Ríos Montt in court On May 10, 2013, Ríos Montt was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to 80 years in prison (50 years for genocide and 30 years for crimes against humanity). Ríos Montt is the first former head of state to have been convicted of genocide by a court in his own country. Announcing the ruling, Judge Iris Yassmin Barrios Aguilar declared that \\"[t]he defendant is responsible for masterminding the crime of genocide\\". She continued: \\"We are convinced that the acts the Ixil suffered constitute the crime of genocide...[Ríos Montt] had knowledge of what was happening and did nothing to stop it.\\" The Court found that \\"[t]he Ixils were considered public enemies of the state and were also victims of racism, considered an inferior race... The violent acts against the Ixils were not spontaneous. They were planned beforehand.\\" Judge Iris Yassmin Barrios Aguilar referred to evidence that 5.5% of the Ixil people had been wiped out by the army. Ríos Montt's lawyers said he would appeal. On May 20, 2013, the Constitutional Court of Guatemala overturned the conviction, voiding all proceedings back to April 19 and ordering that the trial be \\"reset\\" to that point, pending a dispute over the recusal of judges. Ríos Montt's trial resumed in January 2015. The court decided, due to his alleged senility, that a closed door trial would begin in January 2016 and that if he were to be found guilty, a jail sentence would be precluded, given his condition.Closed genocide trial for former Guatemalean President in 2015 , Indian Country Today, Rick Kearns, September 15, 2015.

At the start-up, presenters included Liz Kershaw, Andrew Collins, Tom Robinson, Gideon Coe, Janice Long, Chris Hawkins, Gary Burton, Craig Charles, Stuart Maconie, Brinsley Forde, Suggs, Clare McDonnell, Bruce Dickinson, Tracey MacLeod, Sean Hughes, and Bob Harris. The first record played was Ash's Burn Baby Burn 6 Music attracted criticism for changing daytime schedules during late 2007 and early 2008. In response, Lesley Douglas, Controller of BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music at the time, said that the changes were intended to attract more female listeners. She claimed that \\"men tend to be more interested in the intellectual side of the music, the tracks, where albums have been made, that sort of thing\\". This in turn brought on more criticism of perceived sexism on Douglas' part. A BBC Radio 6 Music studio in Salford In March 2006, BBC 6 Music moved from Broadcasting House to new studios in the adjacent Wogan House (then called Western House) to allow the regeneration of Broadcasting House. In 2011, BBC Radio 6 Music started the process of moving some of its presenters, staff, and shows from London and elsewhere to the new studios at MediaCityUK in Salford near Manchester. The studios are located on the ground floor of Dock House.\\"BBC 6 Music moves to MediaCityUK\\" , How-Do, Monday, 14 November 2011Slade, Jane, \\"Weather girl tunes in to better life in the north\\", Daily Express, Property, 29 February 2012\\"BBC 6 Music teams move into MediaCityUK\\", Radio Today, November 2011 Among programmes broadcast there are Radcliffe & Maconie, The Craig Charles Funk and Soul Show, and Marc Riley's and Mary Anne Hobbs' shows. = Proposed closure = In February 2010, in anticipation of a review by the BBC Trust, newspaper reports suggested 6 Music might be axed. The review stopped short of recommending closure but noted that only one in five UK residents were aware the station existed, and that it lacked presenters with credibility as music experts. The Times claimed that Mark Thompson, Director General of the BBC, proposed closure as part of a bid to scale back BBC operations and allow commercial rivals more room. A high- profile campaign to oppose closure of the station attracted media attention and led to \\"#SaveBBC6Music\\" quickly becoming a trending topic on Twitter. A leading voice in the campaign was Jarvis Cocker, the lead singer for the British band Pulp who presented his own show on BBC 6 Music, Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service. A Facebook group set up by Jon and Tracy Morter to oppose the proposed closure gained nearly 180,000 members. A campaign was launched to get the song \\"Joy Division Oven Gloves\\" by Half Man Half Biscuit to No. 6 in the UK Singles Chart on 12 April 2010; it entered the Singles Chart that week at No. 56 and the Independent Singles Chart at No. 3. The Sunday Times reported that following the public outcry over the proposed closure, 6 Music would be rebranded as Radio 2 Extra, retaining a similar playlist but broadcasting for only 12 hours a day but Tim Davie, head of audio and music at the BBC, denied this was a possibility. Five months after rumours of closure first emerged, the BBC Trust announced that it was not convinced by the BBC Executive's plans and that the station would not be closed. In the first quarter of 2011 some BBC radio services, including 6 Music, were part of an efficiency review conducted by John Myers. His role, according to Andrew Harrison, the chief executive of RadioCentre, was \\"to identify both areas of best practice and possible savings.\\" The Telegraph suggested that this was due to 'commercial sector criticism' whilst The Guardian cited a National Audit Office report. BASCA was actively circulating petitions challenging the BBC's plan to close down 6 Music. Nominations and awards Several of BBC 6 Music's presenters and shows have won Sony Radio Academy Awards. In 2006 presenter Marc Riley won a Silver award for The Music Radio Personality of the Year. In April 2008, comedy duo Adam and Joe's 6 Music Saturday morning show won the Broadcasting Press Guild award for Radio Programme of the Year. George Lamb also won the Sony 'Rising Star' award. In May 2009, Adam and Joe won three Sony Radio Silver awards. Following the announcement that 6 Music was to be closed, Adam and Joe won the best comedy prize at the Sony Radio Academy Awards in May 2010, with Jarvis Cocker winning the rising star award, voted for by listeners, for their 6 Music shows. Two years later, the station was named UK Station of the Year at the Sonys, with the judges citing its \\"confidence across its schedule that not only reflects a real passion for music but also a firm understanding of the audience they are broadcasting to.\\"  Ratings and listenership  In February 2010, 6 Music was reported as showing growth in its audience, winning an audience of 695,000 listeners over the first quarter, up 12.3% year-on-year.\\"Jazz FM, 6Music and Radio 7 are bright spots amid digital radio's gloom\\" Retrieved 22 February 2010 However, in the quarter to December 2009, its 'reach' (proportion of the adult population who listen for at least 5 minutes in the course of an average week) was 1%, and Total Survey Area share (of total listening time) was 0.4%. According to the BBC's service review of Radio 2 and 6 Music, published in February 2010, the average age of 6 Music listeners was 36, which led the authors to suggest more might be done to attract older listeners, considering the station played a broad range of music from the 1960s to the present day. The review also claimed that the deficiency in appeal to female listeners apparent in 2007 was still in existence, and that there should be changes to attract more listeners from ethnic minorities and lower income groups. However, the review did not give details of the scale of these issues. Following the proposal to close the station, online listening figures rose significantly. The number of weekly unique online listeners rose to an average of 133,653 in March 2010, up 50 per cent on the previous March. When the RAJAR listening figures were released in May 2010, it was revealed that 6 Music had an average of 1.02 million listeners in the first three months of the year, compared to 695,000 the previous year. In 2011, 6 Music had a total audience of 1.3 million listeners in the three months to 27 March, up from 1.14m in the previous quarter, according to the latest data from the Radio Joint Audience Research (RAJAR) board. Buoyed by shows from high-profile DJs such as Jarvis Cocker, Huey Morgan and Lauren Laverne, 6 Music has also grown its audience from 1.02m in the first quarter of 2010. The station broke more records in 2012, with a total audience of 1.62 million in the third quarter of the year. For the last month of 2012 RAJAR reported 6 Music listening figures had overtaken BBC Radio 4 extra to become the most listened to digital only radio station in the United Kingdom. The same report also showed that 6 Music had surpassed BBC Radio 3 in listening share, an increase of 31% from the year previously. In 2014, a report was released stating that BBC 6 Music had overtaken BBC Radio 3 in numbers of listeners per week for the first time. The digital station's weekly average was 1.89m listeners (up 5.5% on 2013) while BBC Radio 3's average weekly listenership was only 1.884m. In 2018, BBC Radio 6 Music is the 10th most popular radio station (as measured by weekly reach) – between Talksport & Absolute Radio – and the 6th most popular (as measured by listener hours) – between BBC 5 Live & Kiss. Press coverage In 2007 BBC 6 Music was in the press because of scandals over rigged competitions. It emerged that in 2006 the Liz Kershaw Show faked a competition by using producers and their friends as 'competition winners', leading to the firing of a junior producer. On 20 September 2007, it was announced that the Head of Programmes, Ric Blaxill, had resigned.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bbc-radio-6-chief- quits-over-new-breaches-cdc9wdk6xpc In May 2008 George Lamb was reprimanded for using his programme to back Conservative candidate Boris Johnson for London mayor. 6 Music Festival In January 2014 the BBC launched 6 Music Festival, a new music festival featuring artists that \\"share the alternative spirit of the network\\". The festival takes place in a different city each year, with the first edition held in Manchester in February 2014 and headlined by Damon Albarn. Tickets sold out in six minutes for the event, but Albarn's headline set was criticised and it was claimed that the festival \\"just didn't work\\". 6 Music Festival returned in 2015 in Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, with performances from Neneh Cherry, Royal Blood, The Charlatans and Hot Chip. The festival was praised as a \\"triumphant celebration of the left-field\\", and compared favourably to the 2014 event. The 2016 event was held across three venues in Bristol with performances from Foals and Bloc Party. The 2017 edition took place in March 2017 (unlike previous festivals which took place in February) in Glasgow, and included major sets from Future Islands, Sparks, Depeche Mode, The Shins and Belle and Sebastian. It again included evening gigs, daytime gigs, talks and screenings. No festival took place in 2018. However, the station did curate the Belfast event of the Biggest Weekend. The 2019 edition of the festival took place in Liverpool. It ran for three days across four different venues and included sets from The Good, The Bad & The Queen, Anna Calvi, John Grant, Idles, Fontaines D.C. and She drew the gun. The 2020 edition took place at the London Roundhouse in Camden. Róisín Murphy headlined the Saturday night event.

How those other classes gain access to the mixin's methods depends on the language. Mixins are sometimes described as being \\"included\\" rather than \\"inherited\\". Mixins encourage code reuse and can be used to avoid the inheritance ambiguity that multiple inheritance can cause (the \\"diamond problem\\"), or to work around lack of support for multiple inheritance in a language. A mixin can also be viewed as an interface with implemented methods. This pattern is an example of enforcing the dependency inversion principle. History Mixins first appeared in the Symbolics's object-oriented Flavors system (developed by Howard Cannon), which was an approach to object-orientation used in Lisp Machine Lisp. The name was inspired by Steve's Ice Cream Parlor in Somerville, Massachusetts:Using Mix- ins with Python The owner of the ice cream shop offered a basic flavor of ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, etc.) and blended in a combination of extra items (nuts, cookies, fudge, etc.) and called the item a \\"mix-in\\", his own trademarked term at the time.Mix-Ins (Steve's ice cream, Boston, 1975) Definition Mixins are a language concept that allows a programmer to inject some code into a class. Mixin programming is a style of software development, in which units of functionality are created in a class and then mixed in with other classes.http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MixIn A mixin class acts as the parent class, containing the desired functionality. A subclass can then inherit or simply reuse this functionality, but not as a means of specialization. Typically, the mixin will export the desired functionality to a child class, without creating a rigid, single \\"is a\\" relationship. Here lies the important difference between the concepts of mixins and inheritance, in that the child class can still inherit all the features of the parent class, but, the semantics about the child \\"being a kind of\\" the parent need not be necessarily applied. Advantages # It provides a mechanism for multiple inheritance by allowing multiple classes to use the common functionality, but without the complex semantics of multiple inheritance.http://culttt.com/2015/07/08/working-with-mixins-in-ruby/ # Code reusability: Mixins are useful when a programmer wants to share functionality between different classes. Instead of repeating the same code over and over again, the common functionality can simply be grouped into a mixin and then included into each class that requires it.http://naildrivin5.com/blog/2012/12/19/re-use-in-oo-inheritance.html # Mixins allow inheritance and use of only the desired features from the parent class, not necessarily all of the features from the parent class. Implementations In Simula, classes are defined in a block in which attributes, methods and class initialization are all defined together; thus all the methods that can be invoked on a class are defined together, and the definition of the class is complete. In Flavors, a mixin is a class from which another class can inherit slot definitions and methods. The mixin usually does not have direct instances. Since a Flavor can inherit from more than one other Flavor, it can inherit from one or more mixins. Note that the original Flavors did not use generic functions. In New Flavors (a successor of Flavors) and CLOS, methods are organized in \\"generic functions\\". These generic functions are functions that are defined in multiple cases (methods) by class dispatch and method combinations. CLOS and Flavors allow mixin methods to add behavior to existing methods: \`:before\` and \`:after\` daemons, whoppers and wrappers in Flavors. CLOS added \`:around\` methods and the ability to call shadowed methods via . So, for example, a stream-lock-mixin can add locking around existing methods of a stream class. In Flavors one would write a wrapper or a whopper and in CLOS one would use an \`:around\` method. Both CLOS and Flavors allow the computed reuse via method combinations. \`:before\`, \`:after\` and \`:around\` methods are a feature of the standard method combination. Other method combinations are provided. An example is the \`+\` method combination, where the resulting values of each of the applicable methods of a generic function are arithmetically added to compute the return value. This is used, for example, with the border-mixin for graphical objects. A graphical object may have a generic width function. The border-mixin would add a border around an object and has a method computing its width. A new class \`bordered-button\` (that is both a graphical object and uses the \`border\` mixin) would compute its width by calling all applicable width methods—via the \`+\` method combination. All return values are added and create the combined width of the object. In an OOPSLA 90 paper,OOPSLA '90, Mixin based inheritance (pdf) Gilad Bracha and William Cook reinterpret different inheritance mechanisms found in Smalltalk, Beta and CLOS as special forms of a mixin inheritance. Programming languages that use mixins Other than Flavors and CLOS (a part of Common Lisp), some languages that use mixins are: *Ada (by extending an existing tagged record with arbitrary operations in a generic) *Cobra *ColdFusion (Class based using includes and Object based by assigning methods from one object to another at runtime) *Curl (with Curl RTE) *D (called \\"template mixins\\"; D also includes a \\"mixin\\" statement that compiles strings as code.) *Dart *Factor *Groovy *JavaScript Delegation - Functions as Roles (Traits and Mixins) *Kotlin *Less *OCaml *Perl (through roles in the Moose extension of the Perl 5 object system) *PHP's \\"traits\\" *Magik *Python *Racket (mixins documentation) *Raku *Ruby *Scala *XOTcl/TclOO (object systems builtin to Tcl)Mixin classes in XOTcl * Sass (A stylesheet language) *Smalltalk *Vala *Swift *SystemVerilog *TypeScript (mixins documentation) Some languages do not support mixins on the language level, but can easily mimic them by copying methods from one object to another at runtime, thereby \\"borrowing\\" the mixin's methods. This is also possible with statically typed languages, but it requires constructing a new object with the extended set of methods. Other languages that do not support mixins can support them in a round-about way via other language constructs. C# and Visual Basic .NET support the addition of extension methods on interfaces, meaning any class implementing an interface with extension methods defined will have the extension methods available as pseudo-members. Examples =In Common Lisp= Common Lisp provides mixins in CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) similar to Flavors. \`object-width\` is a generic function with one argument that uses the \`+\` method combination. This combination determines that all applicable methods for a generic function will be called and the results will be added. (defgeneric object-width (object) (:method-combination +)) \`button\` is a class with one slot for the button text. (defclass button () ((text :initform \\"click me\\"))) There is a method for objects of class button that computes the width based on the length of the button text. \`+\` is the method qualifier for the method combination of the same name. (defmethod object-width + ((object button)) (* 10 (length (slot-value object 'text)))) A \`border-mixin\` class. The naming is just a convention. There are no superclasses, and no slots. (defclass border-mixin () ()) There is a method computing the width of the border. Here it is just 4. (defmethod object-width + ((object border-mixin)) 4) \`bordered-button\` is a class inheriting from both \`border-mixin\` and \`button\`. (defclass bordered-button (border-mixin button) ()) We can now compute the width of a button. Calling \`object-width\` computes 80. The result is the result of the single applicable method: the method \`object-width\` for the class \`button\`. ? (object-width (make-instance 'button)) 80 We can also compute the width of a \`bordered-button\`. Calling \`object-width\` computes 84. The result is the sum of the results of the two applicable methods: the method \`object-width\` for the class \`button\` and the method \`object-width\` for the class \`border-mixin\`. ? (object-width (make- instance 'bordered-button)) 84 =In Python= In Python, the \`SocketServer\` moduleSource code for SocketServer in CPython 3.5 has both a \`UDPServer\` class and a \`TCPServer\` class. They act as servers for UDP and TCP socket servers, respectively. Additionally, there are two mixin classes: \`ForkingMixIn\` and \`ThreadingMixIn\`. Normally, all new connections are handled within the same process. By extending \`TCPServer\` with the \`ThreadingMixIn\` as follows: class ThreadingTCPServer(ThreadingMixIn, TCPServer): pass the \`ThreadingMixIn\` class adds functionality to the TCP server such that each new connection creates a new thread. Using the same method, a \`ThreadingUDPServer\` can be created without having to duplicate the code in \`ThreadingMixIn\`. Alternatively, using the \`ForkingMixIn\` would cause the process to be forked for each new connection. Clearly, the functionality to create a new thread or fork a process is not terribly useful as a stand-alone class. In this usage example, the mixins provide alternative underlying functionality without affecting the functionality as a socket server. =In Ruby= Most of the Ruby world is based around mixins via \`Modules\`. The concept of mixins is implemented in Ruby by the keyword \`include\` to which we pass the name of the module as parameter. Example: class Student include Comparable # The class Student inherits the Comparable module using the 'include' keyword attr_accessor :name, :score def initialize(name, score) @name = name @score = score end # Including the Comparable module requires the implementing class to define the <=> comparison operator # Here's the comparison operator. We compare 2 student instances based on their scores. def <=>(other) @score <=> other.score end # Here's the good bit - I get access to <, <=, >,>= and other methods of the Comparable Interface for free. end s1 = Student.new(\\"Peter\\", 100) s2 = Student.new(\\"Jason\\", 90) s1 > s2 #true s1 <= s2 #false =In JavaScript= The Object-Literal and \`extend\` Approach It is technically possible to add behavior to an object by binding functions to keys in the object. However, this lack of separation between state and behavior has drawbacks: # It intermingles properties of the model domain with that of implementation domain. # No sharing of common behavior. Metaobjects solve this problem by separating the domain specific properties of objects from their behaviour specific properties.http://raganwald.com/2014/04/10/mixins- forwarding-delegation.html An extend function is used to mix the behavior in: 'use strict'; const Halfling = function (fName, lName) { this.firstName = fName; this.lastName = lName; }; const mixin = { fullName() { return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName; }, rename(first, last) { this.firstName = first; this.lastName = last; return this; } }; // An extend function const extend = (obj, mixin) => { Object.keys(mixin).forEach(key => obj[key] = mixin[key]); return obj; }; const sam = new Halfling('Sam', 'Loawry'); const frodo = new Halfling('Freeda', 'Baggs'); // Mixin the other methods extend(Halfling.prototype, mixin); console.log(sam.fullName()); // Sam Loawry console.log(frodo.fullName()); // Freeda Baggs sam.rename('Samwise', 'Gamgee'); frodo.rename('Frodo', 'Baggins'); console.log(sam.fullName()); // Samwise Gamgee console.log(frodo.fullName()); // Frodo Baggins Mixin with using Object.assign() 'use strict'; // Creating an object const obj1 = { name: 'Marcus Aurelius', city: 'Rome', born: '121-04-26' }; // Mixin 1 const mix1 = { toString() { return \`\${this.name} was born in \${this.city} in \${this.born}\`; }, age() { const year = new Date().getFullYear(); const born = new Date(this.born).getFullYear(); return year - born; } }; // Mixin 2 const mix2 = { toString() { return \`\${this.name} - \${this.city} - \${this.born}\`; } }; // Adding the methods from mixins to the object using Object.assign() Object.assign(obj1, mix1, mix2); console.log(obj1.toString()); // Marcus Aurelius - Rome - 121-04-26 console.log(\`His age is \${obj1.age()} as of today\`); // His age is 1897 as of today The pure function and delegation based Flight-Mixin Approach Even though the firstly described approach is mostly widespread the next one is closer to what JavaScript's language core fundamentally offers - Delegation. Two function object based patterns already do the trick without the need of a third party's implementation of \`extend\`. 'use strict'; // Implementation const EnumerableFirstLast = (function () { // function based module pattern. const first = function () { return this[0]; }, last = function () { return this[this.length - 1]; }; return function () { // function based Flight-Mixin mechanics ... this.first = first; // ... referring to ... this.last = last; // ... shared code. }; }()); // Application - explicit delegation: // applying [first] and [last] enumerable behavior onto [Array]'s [prototype]. EnumerableFirstLast.call(Array.prototype); // Now you can do: const a = [1, 2, 3]; a.first(); // 1 a.last(); // 3 =In other languages= In the Curl web-content language, multiple inheritance is used as classes with no instances may implement methods. Common mixins include all skinnable \`ControlUI\`s inheriting from \`SkinnableControlUI\`, user interface delegate objects that require dropdown menus inheriting from StandardBaseDropdownUI and such explicitly named mixin classes as \`FontGraphicMixin\`, \`FontVisualMixin\` and \`NumericAxisMixin-of\` class. Version 7.0 added library access so that mixins do not need to be in the same package or be public abstract. Curl constructors are factories that facilitates using multiple-inheritance without explicit declaration of either interfaces or mixins. Interfaces and traits Java 8 introduces a new feature in the form of default methods for interfaces.https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html Basically it allows a method to be defined in an interface with application in the scenario when a new method is to be added to an interface after the interface class programming setup is done. To add a new function to the interface means to implement the method at every class which uses the interface. Default methods help in this case where they can be introduced to an interface any time and have an implemented structure which is then used by the associated classes. Hence default methods adds a possibility of applying the concept in a mixin sort of a way. Interfaces combined with aspect-oriented programming can also produce full-fledged mixins in languages that support such features, such as C# or Java. Additionally, through the use of the marker interface pattern, generic programming, and extension methods, C# 3.0 has the ability to mimic mixins. With C# 3.0 came the introduction of Extension Methods[2] and they can be applied, not only to classes but, also, to interfaces. Extension Methods provide additional functionality on an existing class without modifying the class. It then becomes possible to create a static helper class for specific functionality that defines the extension methods. Because the classes implement the interface (even if the actual interface doesn’t contain any methods or properties to implement) it will pick up all the extension methods also.Implementing Mix-ins with C# Extension MethodsI know the answer (it's 42) : Mix-ins and C#Mixins, generics and extension methods in C# C# 8.0 adds the feature of default interface methods.Mix functionality in when creating classes using interfaces with default interface methods ECMAScript (in most cases implemented as JavaScript) does not need to mimic object composition by stepwise copying fields from one object to another. It nativelyThe many talents of JavaScript for generalizing Role Oriented Programming approaches like Traits and Mixins, April 11, 2014. supports Trait and mixinAngus Croll, A fresh look at JavaScript Mixins, published May 31, 2011.JavaScript Code Reuse Patterns, April 19, 2013. based object composition via function objects that implement additional behavior and then are delegated via \`call\` or \`apply\` to objects that are in need of such new functionality. =In Scala= Scala has a rich type system and Traits are a part of it which helps implement mixin behaviour. As their name reveals, Traits are usually used to represent a distinct feature or aspect that is normally orthogonal to the responsibility of a concrete type or at least of a certain instance.https://gleichmann.wordpress.com/2009/07/19/scala-in- practice-traits-as-mixins-motivation For example, the ability to sing is modeled as such an orthogonal feature: it could be applied to Birds, Persons, etc. trait Singer{ def sing { println(\\" singing … \\") } //more methods } class Bird extends Singer Here, Bird has mixed in all methods of the trait into its own definition as if class Bird had defined method sing() on its own. As \`extends\` is also used to inherit from a super class, in case of a trait \`extends\` is used if no super class is inherited and only for mixin in the first trait. All following traits are mixed in using keyword \`with\`. class Person class Actor extends Person with Singer class Actor extends Singer with Performer Scala allows mixing in a trait (creating an anonymous type) when creating a new instance of a class. In the case of a Person class instance, not all instances can sing. This feature comes use then: class Person{ def tell { println (\\" Human \\") } //more methods } val singingPerson = new Person with Singer singingPerson.sing =In Swift= Mixin can be achieved in Swift by using a language feature called Default implementation in Protocol Extension. protocol ErrorDisplayable { func error(message:String) } extension ErrorDisplayable { func error(message:String) { // Do what it needs to show an error //... print(message) } } struct NetworkManager : ErrorDisplayable { func onError() { error(\\"Please check your internet Connection.\\") } } See also * Abstract type * Decorator pattern * Policy-based design * Trait, a similar structure that doesn't require linear composition References External links * MixIn at Portland Pattern Repository * Mixins in ActionScript * The Common Lisp Object System: An Overview by Richard P. Gabriel and Linda DeMichiel provides a good introduction to the motivation for defining classes by means of generic functions. Category:Object-oriented programming languages ","title":"Mixin"},{"id":"271971","text":"Figure of Christ from the Ghent Altarpiece (1432). In many historical societies, the position of kingship carries a sacral meaning, that is, it is identical with that of a high priest and judge. The concept of theocracy is related, although a sacred king need not necessarily rule through his religious authority; rather, the temporal position has a religious significance.  History  Sir James George Frazer used the concept of the sacred king in his study The Golden Bough (1890–1915), the title of which refers to the myth of the Rex Nemorensis. Frazer gives numerous examples, cited below, and was an inspiration for the myth and ritual school.R Fraser ed., The Golden Bough (Oxford 2009) p. 651 However, \\"the myth and ritual, or myth-ritualist, theory\\" is disputed; many scholars now believe that myth and ritual share common paradigms, but not that one developed from the other. According to Frazer, the notion has prehistoric roots and occurs worldwide, on Java as in sub-Saharan Africa, with shaman-kings credited with rainmaking and assuring fertility and good fortune. The king might also be designated to suffer and atone for his people, meaning that the sacral king could be the pre-ordained victim in a human sacrifice, either killed at the end of his term in the position, or sacrificed in a time of crisis (e.g. the Blót of Domalde). The Ashanti flogged a newly-selected king (Ashantehene) before enthroning him. From the Bronze Age in the Near East, the enthronement and anointment of a monarch is a central religious ritual, reflected in the titles \\"Messiah\\" or \\"Christ\\", which became separated from worldly kingship. Thus Sargon of Akkad described himself as \\"deputy of Ishtar\\", just as the modern Catholic Pope takes the role of the \\"Vicar of Christ\\". Kings are styled as shepherds from earliest times, e.g., the term applied to Sumerian princes such as Lugalbanda in the 3rd millennium BCE. The image of the shepherd combines the themes of leadership and the responsibility to supply food and protection, as well as superiority. As the mediator between the people and the divine, the sacral king was credited with special wisdom (e.g. Solomon or Gilgamesh) or vision (e.g. via oneiromancy).  Study  Study of the concept was introduced by Sir James George Frazer in his influential book The Golden Bough (1890–1915); sacral kingship plays a role in Romanticism and Esotericism (e.g. Julius Evola) and some currents of Neopaganism (Theodism). The school of Pan- Babylonianism derived much of the religion described in the Hebrew Bible from cults of sacral kingship in ancient Babylonia. The so-called British and Scandinavian cult-historical schools maintained that the king personified a god and stood at the center of the national or tribal religion. The English \\"myth and ritual school\\" concentrated on anthropology and folklore, while the Scandinavian \\"Uppsala school\\" emphasized Semitological study. = Frazer's interpretation = A sacred king, according to the systematic interpretation of mythology developed by Frazer in The Golden Bough (published 1890), was a king who represented a solar deity in a periodically re-enacted fertility rite. Frazer seized upon the notion of a substitute king and made him the keystone of his theory of a universal, pan-European, and indeed worldwide fertility myth, in which a consort for the Goddess was annually replaced. According to Frazer, the sacred king represented the spirit of vegetation, a divine John Barleycorn. He came into being in the spring, reigned during the summer, and ritually died at harvest time, only to be reborn at the winter solstice to wax and rule again. The spirit of vegetation was therefore a \\"dying and reviving god\\". Osiris, Dionysus, Attis and many other familiar figures from Greek mythology and classical antiquity were re-interpreted in this mold. The sacred king, the human embodiment of the dying and reviving vegetation god, was supposed to have originally been an individual chosen to rule for a time, but whose fate was to suffer as a sacrifice, to be offered back to the earth so that a new king could rule for a time in his stead. Especially in Europe during Frazer's early twentieth century heyday, it launched a cottage industry of amateurs looking for \\"pagan survivals\\" in such things as traditional fairs, maypoles, and folk arts like morris dancing. It was widely influential in literature, being alluded to by D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce, Ezra Pound, and in T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, among other works. Robert Graves used Frazer's work in The Greek Myths and made it one of the foundations of his own personal mythology in The White Goddess, and in the fictional Seven Days in New Crete he depicted a future in which the institution of a sacrificial sacred king is revived. Margaret Murray, the principal theorist of witchcraft as a \\"pagan survival,\\" used Frazer's work to propose the thesis that many kings of England who died as kings, most notably William Rufus, were secret pagans and witches, whose deaths were the re- enactment of the human sacrifice that stood at the centre of Frazer's myth. This idea used by fantasy writer Katherine Kurtz in her novel Lammas Night.

In fiction  Many of Rosemary Sutcliff's novels are recognized as being directly influenced by Frazer, depicting individuals accepting the burden of leadership and the ultimate responsibility of personal sacrifice, including Sword at Sunset, The Mark of the Horse Lord, and Sun Horse, Moon Horse.Article about Rosemary Sutcliff at the Historical Novels Info website; paragraph 15 In addition to its appearance in her novel Lammas Night noted above, Katherine Kurtz also uses the idea of sacred kingship in her novel The Quest for Saint Camber.Katherine Kurtz, The Quest for Saint Camber, , Ballantine Books, 1986, p 360-363.

It defined the border between the United States and Spanish Florida, and guaranteed the United States navigation rights on the Mississippi River. With this agreement, the first phase of the ongoing border dispute between the two nations in this region, commonly called the West Florida Controversy, came to a close. Thomas Pinckney negotiated the treaty for the United States and Don Manuel de Godoy represented Spain. It was presented to the United States Senate on February 26, 1796, and, after debate, was ratified on March 7, 1796. It was ratified by Spain on April 25, 1796 and ratifications were exchanged on that date. The treaty was proclaimed on August 3, 1796. Background In 1763, Great Britain established two colonies, East Florida and West Florida, out of territory along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast taken from France and Spain after the French and Indian War, part of the Seven Years' War. The British received all of Spanish Florida from Spain and received the portion of French Louisiana east of the Mississippi River, New Orleans, from France as well as all of French Louisiana west of the Mississippi that had been secretly given to Spain the previous year. Both East Florida and West Florida were never extensively colonized by the British and were ceded to Spain, which ruled both provinces as separate and apart from Louisiana) in the 1783 Treaty of Paris at the end of the American Revolutionary War. When the transaction was made however, the boundaries of West Florida, which had changed while under British sovereignty, were not specified. In 1763, West Florida's northern border was initially set at the 31st parallel north, but it was moved in 1764 to 32° 22′, the junction of the Mississippi River and the Yazoo River and now the location of Vicksburg, Mississippi, to give the West Floridians more territory, including the Natchez District and the Tombigbee District. After reacquiring the colony, Spain insisted that its West Florida claim extended fully to 32° 22′, but the U.S. asserted that the land between 31° and 32° 22′ had always been British territory and so rightfully belonged to the United States. In 1784, the Spanish closed New Orleans to American goods coming down the Mississippi River. In 1795, the border was settled, and the United States and Spain concluded a trade agreement. New Orleans was reopened, and Americans could transfer goods without paying cargo fees, the right of deposit, when they transferred goods from one ship to another.Gerard H. Clarfield,\\"Victory in the West: A Study of the Role of Timothy Pickering in the Successful Consummation of Pinckney's Treaty.\\" Essex Institute Historical Collections 101.4 (1965): 333+. Terms Thomas Pinckney Manuel Godoy =Article II= The southern boundary of the United States with the Spanish colonies of East Florida and West Florida was established as a line beginning on the Mississippi River at the 31st parallel north, the 1763 line, drawn due east to the middle of the Chattahoochee River, then downstream along the middle of the river to the junction with the Flint River, then due east to the headwaters of the St. Marys River, and then along the middle of the channel to the Atlantic Ocean. =Article III= A joint Spanish–American team was stipulated for surveying the boundary line. =Article IV= The western boundary of the United States with the Spanish colony of Louisiana was established as the middle of the Mississippi River from the northern boundary of the United States (how far north the Mississippi extended was still unknown) to the 31st degree north latitude, and both Spanish subjects and U.S. citizens would have free navigation along the full length of the Mississippi from its source to the ocean. =Article V= The United States and Spain agreed not to incite native tribes to warfare and to promote mutually- beneficial trade relationships by tribes on both sides of the border. Previously, Spain had been supplying weapons to local tribes for many years. The agreement put the lands of the Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations of American Indians in the new boundaries of the United States. =Articles VI and VII= Spain and the United States also agreed to protect and defend the vessels of the other party anywhere in their jurisdictions and not to detain or embargo each other's citizens or vessels. Ramifications \\"Ellicott's Stone\\" boundary marker along the 31st parallel now in northern Mobile County, Alabama A joint Spanish–American team surveyed the boundary line. Andrew Ellicott served as the head of the U.S. contingent. The region that Spain relinquished its claim by Pinckney's Treaty was organized by Congress as Mississippi Territory on April 7, 1798. Natchez was the territory's first and only capital. Grant (1997) argues that the treaty was critical for the emergence of American expansionism, later known as \\"Manifest Destiny,\\" because control of the Natchez and Tombigbee districts was needed for dominance of the Southwest by the United States. The collapse of Spanish power in the region was inevitable, as Americans poured into the district, and very few Spaniards lived there. Spain gave up the area because of international politics, not local unrest. Spanish rule was accepted by the French and British settlers near Natchez. Relations with the Indians were tranquil. However, with the loss of Natchez, Spain's frontier was no longer secure, and the rest of its territory was gradually lost. British and Spanish West Florida, 1767 to 1819. Under the secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso of October 1, 1800, Spanish Louisiana, comprising both the vast territory west of the Mississippi and New Orleans, was formally retroceded to France, but Spain continued to administer it. Again, as in 1783, the boundaries of the territory being exchanged were not specified. As a result, when France and the United States concluded the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, a new dispute, the second phase of the West Florida Controversy, arose. This time, the disagreement was over whether the portion of West Florida that was first under British and then Spanish control since 1763 (between the Mississippi and Perdido Rivers) was included in the 1801 treaty and thus the Louisiana Purchase. The United States laid claim to the region by asserting it to be included. Spain held that such a claim was baseless.Raymond A. Young, \\"Pinckney's Treaty—A New Perspective\\", Hispanic American Historical Review, November 1963, Vol. 43, Issue 4, pp. 526–539. . While the politicians squabbled, American and British settlers in the region declared an independent Republic of West Florida in 1810. Its capital was located at St. Francisville. It was quickly annexed by the United States and incorporated into the Territory of Orleans, which joined the Union as the state of Louisiana in 1812. The present-day Louisiana civil parishes (equivalent to counties elsewhere in the United States) within the former republic are referred to as the \\"Florida Parishes.\\" Also in 1812, the U.S. annexed the Mobile District of West Florida between the Perdido and Pearl Rivers and declared that it had been included in the Louisiana Purchase.\\"An Act to enlarge the boundaries of the Mississippi territory\\" Spain disputed that and maintained its claim over the area. The following year, a federal statute was secretly enacted authorizing the president to take full possession of the area with the use of military force as deemed necessary.\\"An Act authorizing the President of the United States to take possession of a tract of country lying south of the Mississippi territory and west of the river Perdido\\" Accordingly, General James Wilkinson occupied this district with a military contingent. The Spanish colonial commandant offered no resistance. The annexed land was incorporated into the Mississippi Territory and partitioned five years later when the Alabama Territory was established. In 1819 the United States and Spain negotiated the Adams–Onís Treaty in which Spain ceded all of both West Florida and East Florida into the United States. Since the mid-19th century, the southern (east–west) boundary established by Pinckney's Treaty has formed the state line between: * Florida and Georgia * Florida and Alabamabetween the Chattahoochee and Perdido Rivers * Louisiana and Mississippibetween the Pearl and Mississippi Rivers The line is not a state line between the Pearl and Perdido Rivers to provide Mississippi and Alabama with access to the Gulf of Mexico.

Al-Biruni was well versed in physics, mathematics, astronomy, and natural sciences, and also distinguished himself as a historian, chronologist and linguist. He studied almost all fields of science and was compensated for his research and strenuous work. Royalty and powerful members of society sought out Al-Biruni to conduct research and study to uncover certain findings. In addition to this type of influence, Al-Biruni was also influenced by other nations, such as the Greeks, who he took inspiration from when he turned to studies of philosophy. He was conversant in Khwarezmian, Persian, Arabic, Sanskrit, and also knew Greek, Hebrew and Syriac. He spent much of his life in Ghazni, then capital of the Ghaznavid dynasty, in modern-day central-eastern Afghanistan. In 1017 he travelled to the Indian subcontinent and authored a study of Indian culture Tārīkh al-Hind (History of India) after exploring the Hindu faith practiced in India. He was an impartial writer on customs and creeds of various nations, and was given the title al-Ustadh (\\"The Master\\") for his remarkable description of early 11th-century India. In Iran, Abu Rayhan Biruni's birthday is celebrated as the day of the surveying engineer. Name Al-Biruni is known as Biruni () in Persian and as Al-Biruni () in Arabic. His full name in Arabic is Abū Rayḥān Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad Al-Bīrūnī, and in Persian Abū Rayḥān Bērōnī; New Persian: Abū Rayḥān BīrūnīBĪRŪNĪ, ABŪ RAYḤĀN. Encyclopædia Iranica, (1989, December 15). Retrieved August 20, 2015.)  Life  He was born in the outer district (Bīrūn) of Kath, the capital of the Afrighid dynasty of Khwarezm in Central Asia (or Chorasmia). To conduct research, Al-Biruni used different methods to tackle the various fields he studied. He lived during the Islamic Golden Age, when the Abbasid Caliphs promoted the research of astronomy. Al-Biruni spent the first twenty-five years of his life in Khwarezm where he studied Islamic jurisprudence, theology, grammar, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, philosophy and also dabbled in the field of physics and most other sciences as well. The Iranian Khwarezmian language, which was the language of Biruni, survived for several centuries after Islam until the Turkification of the region, and so must some at least of the culture and lore of ancient Khwarezm, for it is hard to see the commanding figure of Biruni, a repository of so much knowledge, appearing in a cultural vacuum. in He was sympathetic to the Afrighids, who were overthrown by the rival dynasty of Ma'munids in 995. He left his homeland for Bukhara, then under the Samanid ruler Mansur II the son of Nuh. There he corresponded with Avicenna and there are extant exchanges of views between these two scholars. In 998, he went to the court of the Ziyarid amir of Tabaristan, Shams al-Mo'ali Abol-hasan Ghaboos ibn Wushmgir. There he wrote his first important work, al-Athar al-Baqqiya 'an al-Qorun al-Khaliyya (literally: \\"The remaining traces of past centuries\\" and translated as \\"Chronology of ancient nations\\" or \\"Vestiges of the Past\\") on historical and scientific chronology, probably around 1000 A.D., though he later made some amendments to the book. He also visited the court of the Bavandid ruler Al- Marzuban. Accepting the definite demise of the Afrighids at the hands of the Ma'munids, he made peace with the latter who then ruled Khwarezm. Their court at Gorganj (also in Khwarezm) was gaining fame for its gathering of brilliant scientists. In 1017, Mahmud of Ghazni took Rey. Most scholars, including al- Biruni, were taken to Ghazni, the capital of the Ghaznavid dynasty. Biruni was made court astrologer and accompanied Mahmud on his invasions into India, living there for a few years. He was forty-four years old when he went on the journeys with Mahmud of Ghazni. Biruni became acquainted with all things related to India. During this time he wrote his study of India, finishing it around 1030. Along with his writing, Al-Biruni also made sure to extend his study to science while on the expeditions. He sought to find a method to measure the height of the sun, and created a makeshift quadrant for that purpose. Al-Biruni was able to make much progress in his study over the frequent travels that he went on throughout the lands of India. Belonging to the Sunni Ash'ari school, al-Biruni nevertheless also associated with Maturidi theologians. He was however, very critical of the Mu'tazila, particularly criticising al-Jahiz and Zurqan.Watt, W. Montgomery, and Said Hakim M. \\"Al- Bīrūnī and the study of non-Islamic religions.\\" SAID 1979 (1979): 414-9. He also repudiated Avicenna for his views on the eternality of the universe.  Mathematics, astronomy and invention of minutes and seconds  An illustration from al-Biruni's astronomical works, explains the different phases of the moon. Diagram illustrating a method proposed and used by Al-Biruni to estimate the radius and circumference of the Earth Ninety-five of 146 books known to have been written by Bīrūnī were devoted to astronomy, mathematics, and related subjects like mathematical geography. His religion contributed to his research of astronomy, as in Islam, worship and prayer require knowing the precise directions of sacred locations, which can only be accurately found using astronomical data. Biruni's major work on astromomy is primarily an astronomical and mathematical text; he states: \\"I have begun with Geometry and proceeded to Arithmetic and the Science of Numbers, then to the structure of the Universe and finally to Judicial Astrology, for no one who is worthy of the style and title of Astrologer who is not thoroughly conversant with these for sciences.\\" In these earlier chapters he lays the foundations for the final chapter, on astrological prognostication, which he criticises. He made the first semantic distinction between astronomy and astrology.S. Pines (September 1964). \\"The Semantic Distinction between the Terms Astronomy and Astrology according to al-Biruni\\", Isis 55 (3): 343-349. In a later work, he wrote a refutation of astrology, as opposed to astronomy which he supports. Some suggest that his reasons for refuting astrology were due to the methods used by astrologers being based on pseudoscience rather than empiricism and also due to the views of astrologers conflicting with Sunni Islam.George Saliba (1980), \\"Al-Biruni\\", in Joseph Strayer, Dictionary of the Middle Ages, Vol. 2, pp. 60 & 67-69. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. He wrote an extensive commentary on Indian astronomy in the Taḥqīq mā li-l-Hind mostly translation of Aryabhatta's work, in which he claims to have resolved the matter of Earth's rotation in a work on astronomy that is no longer extant, his Miftah- ilm-alhai'a (Key to Astronomy): > [T]he rotation of the earth does in no way impair the value of astronomy, as > all appearances of an astronomic character can quite as well be explained > according to this theory as to the other. There are, however, other reasons > which make it impossible. This question is most difficult to solve. The most > prominent of both modern and ancient astronomers have deeply studied the > question of the moving of the earth, and tried to refute it. We, too, have > composed a book on the subject called Miftah-ilm-alhai'a (Key to Astronomy), > in which we think we have surpassed our predecessors, if not in the words, > at all events in the matter.Al-Biruni, trans. by Edward C. Sachau (1888), > Alberuni's India: an account of the religion, philosophy, and literature, > p.277 In his description of Sijzi's astrolabe he hints at contemporary debates over the movement of the earth. He carried on a lengthy correspondence and sometimes heated debate with Ibn Sina, in which Biruni repeatedly attacks Aristotle's celestial physics: he argues by simple experiment that vacuum must exist; he is \\"amazed\\" by the weakness of Aristotle's argument against elliptical orbits on the basis that they would create vacuum; he attacks the immutability of the celestial spheres; and so on. In his major astronomical work, the Mas'ud Canon, Biruni observed that, contrary to Ptolemy, the sun's apogee (highest point in the heavens) was mobile, not fixed. He wrote a treatise on the astrolabe, describing how to use it to tell the time and as a quadrant for surveying. One particular diagram of an eight geared device could be considered an ancestor of later Muslim astrolabes and clocks. More recently, Biruni's eclipse data was used by Dunthorne in 1749 to help determine the acceleration of the moon,Houtsma M. Th. in Encyclopaedia of Islam (Bearman, P.; Bianquis, Th.; Bosworth, C.E.; van Donzel, E.; Heinrichs, W.P., eds.), (2007). and his data on equinox times and eclipses was used as part of a study of Earth's past rotation. Al-Biruni was the person who first subdivided the hour sexagesimally into minutes, seconds, thirds and fourths in 1000 while discussing Jewish months. Refutation of Eternal Universe Similar to later Asharis, such as al-Ghazali, al-Biruni is famous for vehemently defendingHasr, S. H. \\"An introduction to Islamic cosmological doctrines. Conceptions of nature and methods used for its study by the Ikhwan al Safa, al Biruni and Ibn Sina.\\" (1964). the majority Sunni position that the universe has a beginning, being a strong supporter of creatio ex nihilo, specifically refuting the philosopher Avicenna in a multiple letter correspondence.Berjak R.

Al-Biruni stated the following,Sachau, C. Eduard, ed. The Chronology of Ancient Nations: An English Version of the Arabic Text of the Athâr-ul-Bâkiya of Albîrûni Or'Vestiges of the Past William H. Allen & Company, 1879. He further stated that Aristotle, whose arguments Avicenna uses, contradicted himself when he stated that the universe and matter has a start whilst holding on to the idea that matter is pre-eternal. In his letters to Avicenna, he stated the argument of Aristotle, that there is a change in the creator. He further argued that stating there is a change in the creator would mean there is a change in the effect (meaning the universe has change) and that the universe coming into being after not being is such a change (and so arguing there is no change - no beginning - means Aristotle believes the creator is negated). Al-Biruni was proud of the fact that he followed the textual evidence of the religion without being influenced by Greek philosophers such as Aristotle.  Physics  Al-Biruni contributed to the introduction of the scientific method to medieval mechanics. He developed experimental methods to determine density, using a particular type of hydrostatic balance. Geography and Geodesy  Four directions and Political divisions of Iran by Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī Bīrūnī devised a novel method of determining the earth's radius by means of the observation of the height of a mountain. He carried it out at Nandana in Pind Dadan Khan (present-day Pakistan). He used trigonometry to calculate the radius of the Earth using measurements of the height of a hill and measurement of the dip in the horizon from the top of that hill. His calculated radius for the Earth of 3928.77 miles was 2% higher than the actual mean radius of 3847.80 miles. His estimate was given as 12,803,337 cubits, so the accuracy of his estimate compared to the modern value depends on what conversion is used for cubits. The exact length of a cubit is not clear; with an 18 inch cubit his estimate would be 3,600 miles, whereas with a 22 inch cubit his estimate would be 4,200 miles.Douglas (1973, p.211) One significant problem with this approach is that Al-Biruni was not aware of atmospheric refraction and made no allowance for it. He used a dip angle of 34 arc minutes in his calculations, but refraction can typically alter the measured dip angle by about 1/6, making his calculation only accurate to within about 20% of the true value. In his Codex Masudicus (1037), Al-Biruni theorized the existence of a landmass along the vast ocean between Asia and Europe, or what is today known as the Americas. He argued for its existence on the basis of his accurate estimations of the Earth's circumference and Afro-Eurasia's size, which he found spanned only two-fifths of the Earth's circumference, reasoning that the geological processes that gave rise to Eurasia must surely have given rise to lands in the vast ocean between Asia and Europe. He also theorized that at least some of the unknown landmass would lie within the known latitudes which humans could inhabit, and therefore would be inhabited.  Pharmacology and mineralogy  Biruni wrote a pharmacopoeia, the \\"Kitab al-saydala fi al-tibb\\" (Book on the Pharmacopoeia of Medicine). It lists synonyms for drug names in Syriac, Persian, Greek, Baluchi, Afghan, Kurdi, and some Indian languages. He used a hydrostatic balance to determine the density and purity of metals and precious stones. He classified gems by what he considered their primary physical properties, such as specific gravity and hardness, rather than the common practice of the time of classifying them by colour.  History and chronology  Biruni's main essay on political history, Kitāb al-musāmara fī aḵbār Ḵᵛārazm (Book of nightly conversation concerning the affairs of Ḵᵛārazm) is now known only from quotations in Bayhaqī's Tārīkh-e Masʿūdī. In addition to this various discussions of historical events and methodology are found in connection with the lists of kings in his al-Āthār al-bāqiya and in the Qānūn as well as elsewhere in the Āthār, in India, and scattered throughout his other works. Al-Biruni's “Chronology of Ancient Nations” attempted to accurately establish the length of various historical eras.  History of religions  Bīrūnī is one of the most important Muslim authorities on the history of religion. Al-Biruni was a pioneer in the study of comparative religion. He studied Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and other religions. He assumed the superiority of Islam: \\"We have here given an account of these things in order that the reader may learn by the comparative treatment of the subject how much superior the institutions of Islam are, and how more plainly this contrast brings out all customs and usages, differing from those of Islam, in their essential foulness.\\" However he was happy on occasion to express admiration for other cultures, and quoted directly from other religions' sacred texts when reaching his conclusions. He strived to understand them on their own terms rather than trying to prove them wrong. His underlying concept was that all cultures are at least distant relatives of all other cultures because they are all human constructs. \\"Rather, what Al-Biruni seems to be arguing is that there is a common human element in every culture that makes all cultures distant relatives, however foreign they might seem to one another.\\" Al-Biruni divides Hindus into an educated and an uneducated class. He describes the educated as monotheistic, believing that God is one, eternal, and omnipotent and eschewing all forms of idol worship. He recognizes that uneducated Hindus worshiped a multiplicity of idols yet points out that even some Muslims (such as the Jabiriyya) have adopted anthropomorphic concepts of God.  Anthropology  Al-Biruni wrote about the peoples, customs and religions of the Indian subcontinent. According to Akbar S. Ahmed, like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive participant observation with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, presenting his findings with objectivity and neutrality using cross-cultural comparisons. Akhbar S. Ahmed concluded that Al-Biruni can be considered as the first Anthropologist, however, others argue that he hardly can be considered an anthropologist in the conventional sense.  Indology  Al-Biruni's fame as an Indologist rests primarily on two texts. Al-Biruni wrote an encyclopedic work on India called Taḥqīq mā li-l-Hind min maqūlah maqbūlah fī al-ʿaql aw mardhūlah (variously translated as \\"Verifying All That the Indians Recount, the Reasonable and the Unreasonable\\" or \\"The book confirming what pertains to India, whether rational or despicable\\") in which he explored nearly every aspect of Indian life, including religion, history, geography, geology, science, and mathematics. During his journey through India, military and political histories were not of Al-Biruni's main focus. Instead, he decided to document the more civilian and scholarly areas of Hindu life such as culture, science, and religion. He explores religion within a rich cultural context. He expresses his objective with simple eloquence: He also translated the works of Indian sage Patanjali with the title Tarjamat ketāb Bātanjalī fi’l-ḵalāṣ men al-ertebāk. An example of Al- Biruni's analysis is his summary of why many Hindus hate Muslims. Biruni notes in the beginning of his book how the Muslims had a hard time learning about Hindu knowledge and culture. He explains that Hinduism and Islam are totally different from each other. Moreover, Hindus in 11th century India had suffered waves of destructive attacks on many of its cities, and Islamic armies had taken numerous Hindu slaves to Persia, which—claimed Al-Biruni—contributed to Hindus becoming suspicious of all foreigners, not just Muslims. Hindus considered Muslims violent and impure, and did not want to share anything with them. Over time, Al-Biruni won the welcome of Hindu scholars. Al-Biruni collected books and studied with these Hindu scholars to become fluent in Sanskrit, discover and translate into Arabic the mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and other fields of arts as practiced in 11th-century India. He was inspired by the arguments offered by Indian scholars who believed earth must be globular in shape, which is the only way to fully explain the difference in daylight hours by latitude, seasons and earth's relative positions with moon and stars. At the same time, Al-Biruni was also critical of Indian scribes who he believed carelessly corrupted Indian documents while making copies of older documents. He also criticized the Hindus on what he saw them do and not do, like their deficiencies in curiosity about history and religion. One of the specific aspects of Hindu life that Al- Biruni studied was the Hindu calendar. His scholarship on the topic exhibited great determination and focus, not to mention the excellence in his approach of the in-depth research he performed. He developed a method for converting the dates of the Hindu calendar to the dates of the three different calendars that were common in the Islamic countries of his time period, the Greek, the Arab/Muslim, and the Persian. Biruni also employed astronomy in the determination of his theories, which were complex mathematical equations and scientific calculation that allows one to convert dates and years between the different calendars. The book does not limit itself to tedious records of battle because Al-Biruni found the social culture to be more important. The work includes research on a vast array of topics of Indian culture, including descriptions of their traditions and customs. Although he tried to stay away from political and military history, Biruni did indeed record important dates and noted actual sites of where significant battles occurred. Additionally, he chronicled stories of Indian rulers and told of how they ruled over their people with their beneficial actions and acted in the interests of the nation. But, his details are brief and mostly just list rulers without referring to their real names. He did not go on about deeds that each one carried out during their reign, which keeps in line with Al-Biruni's mission to try to stay away from political histories. Al-Biruni also described the geography of India in his work. He documented different bodies of water and other natural phenomena. These descriptions are useful to today's modern historians because they are able to use Biruni's scholarship to locate certain destinations in modern-day India. Historians are able to make some matches while also concluding that certain areas seem to have disappeared and been replaced with different cities. Different forts and landmarks were able to be located, legitimizing Al-Biruni's contributions with their usefulness to even modern history and archeology. The dispassionate account of Hinduism given by Al- Biruni was remarkable for its time. He stated that he was fully objective in his writings, remaining unbiased like a proper historian should. Biruni documented everything about India just as it happened. But, he did note how some of the accounts of information that he was given by natives of the land may not have been reliable in terms of complete accuracy, however, he did try to be as honest as possible in his writing. Dr. Edward C. Sachau compares it to \\"a magic island of quiet, impartial research in the midst of a world of clashing swords, burning towns, and plundered temples.\\" Biruni's writing was very poetic, which may diminish some of the historical value of the work for modern times. The lack of description of battle and politics makes those parts of the picture completely lost. However, Many have used Al-Biruni's work to check facts of history in other works that may have been ambiguous or had their validity questioned.  Works  Most of the works of Al-Biruni are in Arabic although he seemingly wrote the Kitab al-Tafhim in both Persian and Arabic, showing his mastery over both languages.S.H.

It was only hundreds of years later in the West, that his books became read and referenced again, especially his book on India which became relevant to the British Empire's activity in India from the 17th century. A film about his life, Abu Raykhan Beruni, was released in the Soviet Union in 1974.

Before the band was formed, Gira intended to call his post-Swans acoustic/song-based project The Pleasure Seekers.

His ancestry came from the region of Dinawar, in Kermanshah in modern-day western Iran. He was instructed in the two main traditions of the Abbasid-era grammarians of al-Baṣrah and of al- Kūfah. His principal teachers were Ibn al-Sikkīt and his own father. He studied grammar, philology, geometry, arithmetic, and astronomy and was known to be a reliable traditionist. His most renowned contribution is Book of Plants, for which he is considered the founder of Arabic botany. Dinawari was said to have been of Persian origin. Although he was also said to have been Kurdish, or Arab of Persian ancestry.Encyclopedia of Islam, ed., Th. Houtsma, Brill Academic, 1993 p. 977 He may have studied astronomy in Isfahan.. Works The tenth century biographical encyclopedia, \\"al-Fihrist\\" of Al- Nadim, lists sixteen book titles by Dinawari: =Mathematics and natural sciences= #Kitâb al-kusuf (\\"Book of Solar Eclipses\\") #Kitāb an-nabāt yufadiluh al-‘ulamā' fī ta’līfih (), ‘Plants, valued by scholars for its composition' #Kitāb Al-Anwā () 'Tempest' (weather) #Kitāb Al-qiblah wa'z-zawāl () \\"Book of Astral Orientations\\" #Kitāb ḥisāb ad-dūr (), \\"Arithmetic/Calculation of Cycles\\" #Kitāb ar-rud ‘alā raṣd al-Iṣbhānī () Refutation of Lughdah al-Iṣbhānī #Kitāb al-baḥth fī ḥusā al-Hind (), \\"Analysis of Indian Arithmetic\\" #Kitāb al-jam’ wa'l-tafrīq (); \\"Book of Arithmetic/Summation and Differentiation\\" #Kitāb al-jabr wa-l-muqabila (), \\"Algebra and Equation\\" #Kitāb nuwādr al-jabr (), \\"Rare Forms of Algebra\\" =Social sciences and humanities= #Kitāb al-akhbār al-ṭiwāl (), \\"General History\\" # Kitāb Kabīr () \\"Great Book\\" [in history of sciences] #Kitāb al- faṣāha (), \\"Book of Rhetoric\\" #Kitāb al-buldān (), \\"Book of Cities (Regions) (Geography)\\" #Kitāb ash-sh’ir wa-shu’arā’ (), \\"Poetry and the Poets\\" #Kitāb al-Waṣāyā (), Commandments (wills); #Kitāb ma yulahan fīh al’āmma (), How the Populace Errs in Speaking; #Islâh al-mantiq (\\"Improvement of Speech\\") #Ansâb al-Akrâd (\\"Ancestry of the Kurds\\"). Editions & Translations His General History (Al-Akhbar al-Tiwal) has been edited and published numerous times (Vladimir Guirgass, 1888; Muhammad Sa'id Rafi'i, 1911; Ignace Krachkovsky, 1912; 'Abd al-Munim 'Amir & Jamal al-din Shayyal, 1960; Isam Muhammad al-Hajj 'Ali, 2001), but has not been translated in its entirety into a European language. Jackson Bonner has recently prepared an English translation of the pre-Islamic passages of al-Akhbar al-Tiwal. Book of Plants Al-Dinawari is considered the founder of Arabic botany for his Kitab al-Nabat (Book of Plants), which consisted of six volumes. Only the third and fifth volumes have survived, though the sixth volume has partly been reconstructed based on citations from later works. In the surviving portions of his works, 637 plants are described from the letters sin to ya. He describes the phases of plant growth and the production of flowers and fruit., in The first part of the Book of Plants describes astronomical and meteorological concepts as they relate to plants, including the planets and constellations, the sun and moon, the lunar phases indicating seasons and rain, anwa, and atmospheric phenomena such as winds, thunder, lightning, snow, and floods. The book also describes different types of ground, indicating which types are more convenient for plants and the qualities and properties of good ground. Al-Dinawari quoted from other early Muslim botanical works that are now lost, such as those of al-Shaybani, Ibn al-Arabi, al-Bahili, and Ibn as-Sikkit.

', ) is a school of thought within fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence). The major Sunni madhhabs are Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali. They emerged in the ninth and tenth centuries CE and by the twelfth century almost all jurists aligned themselves with a particular madhhab. These four schools recognize each other's validity and they have interacted in legal debate over the centuries. Rulings of these schools are followed across the Muslim world without exclusive regional restrictions, but they each came to dominate in different parts of the world. For example, the Maliki school is predominant in North and West Africa; the Hanafi school in South and Central Asia; the Shafi'i school in East Africa and Southeast Asia; and the Hanbali school in North and Central Arabia. The first centuries of Islam also witnessed a number of short-lived Sunni madhhabs. The Zahiri school, which is commonly identified as extinct, continues to exert influence over legal thought. The development of Shia legal schools occurred along the lines of theological differences and resulted in formation of the Twelver, Zaidi and Ismaili madhhabs, whose differences from Sunni legal schools are roughly of the same order as the differences among Sunni schools. The Ibadi legal school, distinct from Sunni and Shia madhhabs, is predominant in Oman. The transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the madhhab system. With the spread of codified state laws in the Muslim world, the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system. State law codification commonly drew on rulings from multiple madhhabs, and legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional ulema as interpreters of the resulting laws. In the 20th century many Islamic jurists began to assert their intellectual independence from traditional madhhabs. The Amman Message, which was endorsed in 2005 by prominent Islamic scholars around the world, recognized four Sunni schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali), two Shia schools (Ja'fari, Zaidi), the Ibadi school and the Zahiri school.  History  =\\"Ancient\\" schools= According to John Burton, “modern research shows” that fiqh was first “regionally organized” with “considerable disagreement and variety of view”. In the second century of Islam, schools of fiqh were noted for the loyalty of their jurists to the legal practices of their local communities, whether Mecca, Kufa, Basra, Syria, etc.Burton, Islamic Theories of Abrogation, 1990: p.13 (Egypt's school in Fustat was a branch of Medina's school of law and followed such practices—up until the end of the 8th century—as basing verdict on one single witness (not two) and the oath of the claimant. Its principal jurist in the second half of the 8th century was al-Layth b. Sa'd.) Al-Shafi‘i writes that, \`every capital of the Muslims is a seat of learning whose people follow the opinion of one of their countrymen in most of his teachings\`. The \\"real basis\\" of legal doctrine in these \\"ancient schools\\" was not a body of reports of Muhammad's sayings, doings, silent approval (the ahadith) or even those of his Companions, but the \`living tradition\` of the school as \\"expressed in the consensus of the scholars\\", according to Joseph Schacht. =Al-Shafi‘i and after= It has been asserted that madhahib were consolidated in the 9th and 10th centuries as a means of excluding dogmatic theologians, government officials and non-Sunni sects from religious discourse. Historians have differed regarding the times at which the various schools emerged. One interpretation is that Sunni Islam was initially split into four groups: the Hanafites, Malikites, Shafi'ites and Zahirites.Mohammad Sharif Khan and Mohammad Anwar Saleem, Muslim Philosophy And Philosophers, pg. 34. New Delhi: Ashish Publishing House, 1994. Later, the Hanbalites and Jarirites developed two more schools; then various dynasties effected the eventual exclusion of the Jarirites;Christopher Melchert, The Formation of the Sunni Schools of Law: 9th-10th Centuries C.E., pg. 178. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997. eventually, the Zahirites were also excluded when the Mamluk Sultanate established a total of four independent judicial positions, thus solidifying the Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i and Hanbali schools. During the era of the Islamic Gunpowders, the Ottoman Empire reaffirmed the official status of these four schools as a reaction to Shi'ite Persia.Chibli Mallat, Introduction to Middle Eastern Law, pg. 116. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007. Some are of the view that Sunni jurisprudence falls into two groups: Ahl al-Ra'i (\\"people of opinions\\", emphasizing scholarly judgment and reason) and Ahl al- Hadith (\\"people of traditions\\", emphasizing strict interpretation of scripture).Murtada Mutahhari, The Role of Ijtihad in Legislation, Al-Tawhid volume IV, No.2, Publisher: Islamic Thought Foundation 10th century Shi'ite scholar Ibn al-Nadim named eight groups: Maliki, Hanafi, Shafi'i, Zahiri, Imami Shi'ite, Ahl al-Hadith, Jariri and Kharijite.Devin J. Stewart, THE STRUCTURE OF THE FIHRIST: IBN AL-NADIM AS HISTORIAN OF ISLAMIC LEGAL AND THEOLOGICAL SCHOOLS, International Journal of Middle East Studies, v.39, pg.369-387, Cambridge University Press, 2007 In the 12th century Jariri and Zahiri schools were absorbed by the Shafi'i school. Ibn Khaldun defined only three Sunni madhahib: Hanafi, Zahiri, and one encompassing the Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali schools as existing initially,Ignác Goldziher, The Zahiris, pg. 5. Trns.

Meinhaj Hussain, A New Medina, The Legal System, Grande Strategy, January 5th, 2012 noting that by the 14th- century historian the Zahiri school had become extinct, only for it to be revived again in parts of the Muslim world by the mid-20th century.Daniel W.

Ed. Ibrahim Abu-Rabi'. Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. Historically, the fiqh schools were often in political and academic conflict with one another, vying for favor with the ruling government in order to have their representatives appointed to legislative and especially judiciary positions. Geographer and historian Al-Muqaddasi once satirically categorized competing madhahib with contrasting personal qualities: Hanafites, highly conscious of being hired for official positions, appeared deft, well- informed, devout and prudent; Malikites, dull and obtuse, confined themselves to observance of prophetic tradition; Shafi'ites were shrewd, impatient, understanding and quick-tempered; Zahirites haughty, irritable, loquacious and well-to-do; Shi'ites, entrenched and intractable in old rancor, enjoyed riches and fame; and Hanbalites, anxious to practice what they preached, were charitable and inspiring.Louis Massignon, The Passion of al-Hallaj: Mystic and Martyr of Islam. Trans. Herbert W. Mason. Pg. 130. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. While such descriptions were almost assuredly humorous in nature, ancient differences were less to do with actual doctrinal opinions than with maneuvering for adherents and influence. = Modern era = The transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the madhhab system. Legal practice in most of the Muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law, so that the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system. State law codification commonly utilized the methods of takhayyur (selection of rulings without restriction to a particular madhhab) and talfiq (combining parts of different rulings on the same question). Legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional ulema as interpreters of the resulting laws. Global Islamic movements have at times drawn on different madhhabs and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence. The Hanbali school, with its particularly strict adherence to the Quran and hadith, has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation by the Salafi and Wahhabi movements. In the 20th century many Islamic jurists began to assert their intellectual independence from traditional schools of jurisprudence. Examples of the latter approach include networks of Indonesian ulema and Islamic scholars residing in Muslim-minority countries, who have advanced liberal interpretations of Islamic law.  List of schools  Some regions have a dominant or official madhhab; others recognize a variety.Jurisprudence and Law – Islam Reorienting the Veil, University of North Carolina (2009) Generally, Sunnis have a single preferred madhhab from region to region, but also believe that ijtihad must be exercised by the contemporary scholars capable of doing so. Most rely on taqlid, or acceptance of religious rulings and epistemology from a higher religious authority in deferring meanings of analysis and derivation of legal practices instead of relying on subjective readings.On Islam, Muslims and the 500 most influential figures Experts and scholars of fiqh follow the usul (principles) of their own native madhhab, but they also study the usul, evidences, and opinions of other madhahib. =Sunni= Sunni schools of jurisprudence are each named after the classical jurist who taught them. The four primary Sunni schools are the Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali rites. The Zahiri school remains in existence but outside of the mainstream, while the Jariri, Laythi, Awza'i, Thawri, & Qurtubi have become extinct. The extant schools share most of their rulings, but differ on the particular practices which they may accept as authentic and the varying weights they give to analogical reason and pure reason. * The Hanafi school was founded by Abu Hanifa an-Nu‘man. It is followed by Muslims in the Levant, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, most of Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, the Balkans and by most of Russia's Muslim community. There are movements within this school such as Barelvis and Deobandi, which are concentrated in South Asia. * The Maliki school was founded by Malik ibn Anas. It is followed by Muslims in North Africa, West Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, in parts of Saudi Arabia and in Upper Egypt. The Murabitun World Movement follows this school as well. In the past, it was also followed in parts of Europe under Islamic rule, particularly Islamic Spain and the Emirate of Sicily. * The Shafi'i school was founded by Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i. It is followed by Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Eastern Lower Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Jordan, Palestine, the Philippines, Singapore, Somalia, Thailand, Yemen, Kurdistan, and the Mappilas of Kerala and Konkani Muslims of India. It is the official school followed by the governments of Brunei and Malaysia. * The Hanbali school was founded by Ahmad ibn Hanbal. It is followed by Muslims in Qatar, most of Saudi Arabia and minority communities in Syria and Iraq. The majority of the Salafis follow this school. * The Zahiri school was founded by Dawud al-Zahiri. It is followed by minority communities in Morocco and Pakistan. In the past, it was also followed by the majority of Muslims in Mesopotamia, Portugal, the Balearic Islands, North Africa and parts of Spain. =Shia= * Twelvers (see also Imami) ** Ja'fari: associated with Ja'far al- Sadiq. The time and space bound rulings of early jurists are taken more seriously in this school, likely due to the more hierarchical structure of Shia Islam which is ruled by the Shi'ite Imams. The Ja'fari school is also more flexible in that every jurist has considerable power to alter a decision according to his reasoning. The Jafari school uses the intellect instead of analogy when establishing Islamic laws, as opposed to common Sunni practice. *** Usulism: forms the overwhelming majority within the Twelver Shia denomination. They follow a Marja-i Taqlid on the subject of taqlid and fiqh. They are concentrated in Iran, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, India, Iraq, and Lebanon. *** Akhbarism: similar to Usulis, however reject ijtihad in favor of hadith. Concentrated in Bahrain. *** Shaykhism: an Islamic religious movement founded by Shaykh Ahmad in the early 19th century Qajar dynasty, Iran, now retaining a minority following in Iran and Iraq. It began from a combination of Sufi and Shia and Akhbari doctrines. In the mid 19th-century many Shaykhis converted to the Bábí and Baháʼí religions, which regard Shaykh Ahmad highly. ** The Batiniyyah school consists of Alevis, Bektashis, and Alawites, who developed their own fiqh system and do not pursue the Ja'fari jurisprudence. *** Alawism is followed by Alawites, who are also called Nusayris, Nusairis, Namiriya or Ansariyya. Their madh'hab was established by Ibn Nusayr, and their aqidah is developed by Al-Khaṣībī. They follow Cillī aqidah of \\"Maymūn ibn Abu’l-Qāsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabarānī fiqh\\" of the ‘Alawis.\\"Muhammad ibn Āliyy’ūl Cillī aqidah\\" of \\"Maymūn ibn Abu’l-Qāsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabarānī fiqh\\" (Sūlaiman Affandy, Al-Bākūrat’ūs Sūlaiman’īyyah - Family tree of the Nusayri Tariqat, pp. 14-15, Beirut, 1873.)Both Muhammad ibn Āliyy’ūl Cillī and Maymūn ibn Abu’l-Qāsim’at-Tabarānī were the murids of \\"Al-Khaṣībī\\", the founder of the Nusayri tariqat. Slightly over one million of them live in Syria and Lebanon. *** Alevism, sometimes categorized as part of Twelver Shia Islam and sometimes as its own religious tradition, as it has markedly different philosophy, customs, and rituals. They have many Tasawwufī characteristics and express belief in the Qur'an and The Twelve Imams, but reject polygamy and accept religious traditions predating Islam, like Turkish shamanism. They are significant in East-Central Turkey. They are sometimes considered a Sufi sect, and have an untraditional form of religious leadership that is not scholarship oriented like other Sunni and Shia groups. They number around 24 million worldwide, of which 17 million are in Turkey, with the rest in the Balkans, Albania, Azerbaijan, Iran and Syria. *** Bektashism, similar to Alevism. Concentrated in Albania. * Ismaili Muslims who adhere to the Shi'a Ismaili Fatimid fiqh, follow the Daim al-Islam, a book on the rulings of Islam. It describes manners and etiquette, including Ibadat in the light of guidance provided by the Ismaili Imams. The book emphasizes what importance Islam has given to manners and etiquette along with the worship of God, citing the traditions of the first four Imams of the Shi'a Ismaili Fatimid school of thought. ** Nizari: the largest branch (95%) of Ismā'īlī, they are the only Shia group to have their absolute temporal leader in the rank of Imamate, which is invested in the Aga Khan. Nizārī Ismā'īlīs believe that the successor-Imām to the Fatimid caliph Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah was his elder son al-Nizār. While Nizārī belong to the Ja'fari jurisprudence, they adhere to the supremacy of \\"Kalam\\", in the interpretation of scripture, and believe in the temporal relativism of understanding, as opposed to fiqh (traditional legalism), which adheres to an absolutism approach to revelation. ** Tāyyebī Mustā'līyyah: the Mustaali group of Ismaili Muslims differ from the Nizāriyya in that they believe that the successor-Imām to the Fatimid caliph, al- Mustansir, was his younger son al-Mustaʻlī, who was made Caliph by the Fatimad Regent Al-Afdal Shahanshah. In contrast to the Nizaris, they accept the younger brother al-Mustaʻlī over Nizār as their Imam. The Bohras are an offshoot of the Taiyabi, which itself was an offshoot of the Mustaali. The Taiyabi, supporting another offshoot of the Mustaali, the Hafizi branch, split with the Mustaali Fatimid, who recognized Al-Amir as their last Imam. The split was due to the Taiyabi believing that At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim was the next rightful Imam after Al-Amir. The Hafizi themselves however considered Al-Hafiz as the next rightful Imam after Al-Amir. The Bohras believe that their 21st Imam, Taiyab abi al-Qasim, went into seclusion and established the offices of the Da'i al-Mutlaq (الداعي المطلق), Ma'zoon (مأذون) and Mukasir (مكاسر). The Bohras are the only surviving branch of the Mustaali and themselves have split into the Dawoodi Bohra, Sulaimani Bohra, and Alavi Bohra. * Zaidi jurisprudence follows the teachings of Zayd ibn Ali. In terms of law, the Zaidi school is quite similar to the Hanafi school from Sunni Islam.Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, التاريخ الصغير عن الشيعة اليمنيين (A short History of the Yemenite Shi‘ites, 2005) This is likely due to the general trend of Sunni resemblance within Zaidi beliefs. After the passing of Muhammad, Imam Jafar al-Sadiq, Imam Zayd ibn Ali, Imams Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik ibn Anas worked together in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina along with over 70 other leading jurists and scholars. Jafar al-Sadiq and Zayd ibn Ali did not themselves write any books. But their views are Hadiths in the books written by Imams Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik ibn Anas. Therefore, the Zaydis to this day and originally the Fatimids, used the Hanafi jurisprudence, as do most Sunnis. =Ibadi = The Ibadi school of Islam is named after Abd-Allah ibn Ibadh, though he is not necessarily the main figure of the school in the eyes of its adherents. Ibadism is distinct from both Sunni and Shi'ite Islam not only in terms of its jurisprudence, but also its core beliefs.  Amman Message  The Amman Message was a statement, signed in 2005 in Jordan by nearly 200 prominent Islamic jurists, which served as a \\"counter-fatwa\\" against a widespread use of takfir (excommunication) by jihadist groups to justify jihad against rulers of Muslim-majority countries. The Amman Message recognized eight legitimate schools of Islamic law and prohibited declarations of apostasy against them. The Three Points of The Amman Message V.1 # Hanafi (Sunni) # Maliki (Sunni) # Shafi'i (Sunni) # Hanbali (Sunni) # Ja\`fari (Shia) # Zaidiyyah (Shia) # Ibadiyyah # Zahiriyah The statement also asserted that fatwas can be issued only by properly trained muftis, thereby seeking to delegitimize fatwas issued by militants who lack the requisite qualifications.

Badīʿ az-Zaman Abu l-ʿIzz ibn Ismāʿīl ibn ar-Razāz al-Jazarī (1136–1206, , ) was a Muslim polymath: a scholar, inventor, mechanical engineer, artisan, artist and mathematician from Jazira in Mesopotamia. He is best known for writing The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices () in 1206, where he described 100 mechanical devices, some 80 of which are trick vessels of various kinds, along with instructions on how to construct them. He is credited with the inventions of the flush toilet and the elephant clock. Biography Diagram of a hydropowered perpetual flute from The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices by Al-Jazari in 1206. Al-Jazari was born in the area of Upper Mesopotamia in 1136. Sources state his exact location is unknown, but they speculate he could have been born in Jazirat ibn Umar, where he got the name Jazari from or Al-Jazira which was used to denote Upper Mesopotamia. The only biographical information known about him is contained in his Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices. Like his father before him, he served as chief engineer at the Artuklu Palace, the residence of the Mardin branch of the Artuqids which ruled across eastern Anatolia as vassals of the Zengid dynasty of Mosul and later of Ayyubid general Saladin.Donald Hill, \\"Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East\\", Scientific American, May 1991, pp. 64-9 (cf. Donald Hill, Mechanical Engineering ) Al-Jazari was part of a tradition of artisans and was thus more a practical engineer than an inventorDonald R. Hill, in Dictionary of scientific biography, 15, suppl. I, p. 254. who appears to have been \\"more interested in the craftsmanship necessary to construct the devices than in the technology which lay behind them\\" and his machines were usually \\"assembled by trial and error rather than by theoretical calculation\\". His Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices appears to have been quite popular as it appears in a large number of manuscript copies, and as he explains repeatedly, he only describes devices he has built himself. According to Mayr, the book's style resembles that of a modern \\"do-it-yourself\\" book.Otto Mayr (1970), The Origins of Feedback Control, MIT Press, , pp. 32–33. Some of his devices were inspired by earlier devices, such as one of his monumental water clocks, which was based on that of a Pseudo-Archimedes.Ahmad Y. al-Hassan, \\"al-Jazari And the History of the Water Clock\\" He also cites the influence of the Banū Mūsā brothers for his fountains, al-Saghani for the design of a candle clock, and Hibatullah ibn al-Husayn (d. 1139) for musical automata. Al-Jazari goes on to describe the improvements he made to the work of his predecessors, and describes a number of devices, techniques and components that are original innovations which do not appear in the works by his precessors. Mechanisms and methods The most significant aspect of al-Jazari's machines are the mechanisms, components, ideas, methods, and design features which they employ. =Camshaft= A camshaft, a shaft to which cams are attached, was introduced in 1206 by al-Jazari, who employed them in his automata,Georges Ifrah (2001). The Universal History of Computing: From the Abacus to the Quatum Computer, p. 171, Trans. E.F. Harding, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (See ) water clocks (such as the candle clock) and water-raising machines. The cam and camshaft also appeared in European mechanisms from the 14th century.A. Lehr (1981), De Geschiedenis van het Astronomisch Kunstuurwerk, p. 227, Den Haag. (See odur.let.rug.nl) =Crankshaft and crank-slider mechanism= The eccentrically mounted handle of the rotary quern-stone in fifth century BCE Spain that spread across the Roman Empire constitutes a crank.Tullia Ritti, Klaus Grewe, Paul Kessener: \\"A Relief of a Water-powered Stone Saw Mill on a Sarcophagus at Hierapolis and its Implications“, Journal of Roman Archaeology, Vol. 20 (2007), pp. 138–163 (159) The earliest evidence of a crank and connecting rod mechanism dates to the 3rd century AD Hierapolis sawmill in the Roman Empire. The crank also appears in the mid-9th century in several of the hydraulic devices described by the Banū Mūsā brothers in their Book of Ingenious Devices. In 1206, al-Jazari invented an early crankshaft, which he incorporated with a crank-connecting rod mechanism in his twin-cylinder pump. Like the modern crankshaft, al-Jazari's mechanism consisted of a wheel setting several crankpins into motion, with the wheel's motion being circular and the pins moving back-and-forth in a straight line. The crankshaft described by al- Jazari transforms continuous rotary motion into a linear reciprocating motion, and is central to modern machinery such as the steam engine, internal combustion engine and automatic controls.Paul Vallely, How Islamic Inventors Changed the World, The Independent, 11 March 2006. He used the crankshaft with a connecting rod in two of his water-raising machines: the crank-driven saqiya chain pump and the double-action reciprocating piston suction pump.Ahmad Y. al-Hassan, The Crank-Connecting Rod System in a Continuously Rotating Machine His water pump also employed the first known crank-slider mechanism. =Design and construction methods= English technology historian Donald Hill writes: =Escapement mechanism in a rotating wheel= Al-Jazari invented a method for controlling the speed of rotation of a wheel using an escapement mechanism.Donald Hill, \\"Engineering\\", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Vol. 2, pp. 751–795 [792]. Routledge, London and New York. =Mechanical controls= According to Donald Hill, al-Jazari described several early mechanical controls, including \\"a large metal door, a combination lock and a lock with four bolts\\". =Segmental gear= A segmental gear is \\"a piece for receiving or communicating reciprocating motion from or to a cogwheel, consisting of a sector of a circular gear, or ring, having cogs on the periphery, or face.\\"Segment gear, TheFreeDictionary.com Professor Lynn Townsend White, Jr. wrote: Water-raising machines al-Jazari's hydropowered saqiya chain pump device. Al-Jazari invented five machines for raising water, as well as watermills and water wheels with cams on their axle used to operate automata, in the 12th and 13th centuries, and described them in 1206. It was in these water-raising machines that he introduced his most important ideas and components. =Saqiya chain pumps= The first known use of a crankshaft in a chain pump was in one of al-Jazari's saqiya machines. The concept of minimizing intermittent working is also first implied in one of al-Jazari's saqiya chain pumps, which was for the purpose of maximising the efficiency of the saqiya chain pump. Al-Jazari also constructed a water-raising saqiya chain pump which was run by hydropower rather than manual labour, though the Chinese were also using hydropower for chain pumps prior to him. Saqiya machines like the ones he described have been supplying water in Damascus since the 13th century up until modern times,Ahmad Y. al-Hassan, al-Jazari and the History of the Water Clock and were in everyday use throughout the medieval Islamic world.Donald Hill, \\"Engineering\\", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Vol. 2, pp. 751–795 [776]. Routledge, London and New York. =Double-action suction pump with valves and reciprocating piston motion= Citing the Byzantine siphon used for discharging Greek fire as an inspiration, al-Jazari went on to describe the first suction pipes, suction pump, double-action pump, and made early uses of valves and a crankshaft- connecting rod mechanism, when he invented a twin-cylinder reciprocating piston suction pump. This pump is driven by a water wheel, which drives, through a system of gears, an oscillating slot-rod to which the rods of two pistons are attached. The pistons work in horizontally opposed cylinders, each provided with valve-operated suction and delivery pipes. The delivery pipes are joined above the centre of the machine to form a single outlet into the irrigation system. This water-raising machine had a direct significance for the development of modern engineering. This pump is remarkable for three reasons: *The first known use of a true suction pipe (which sucks fluids into a partial vacuum) in a pump. *The first application of the double-acting principle. *The conversion of rotary to reciprocating motion via the crank- connecting rod mechanism. Al-Jazari's suction piston pump could lift 13.6 metres of water, with the help of delivery pipes. This was more advanced than the suction pumps that appeared in 15th-century Europe, which lacked delivery pipes. It was not, however, any more efficient than the noria commonly used by the Muslim world at the time. =Water supply system= al-Jazari developed the earliest water supply system to be driven by gears and hydropower, which was built in 13th century Damascus to supply water to its mosques and Bimaristan hospitals. The system had water from a lake turn a scoop-wheel and a system of gears which transported jars of water up to a water channel that led to mosques and hospitals in the city.Howard R. Turner (1997), Science in Medieval Islam: An Illustrated Introduction, p. 81, University of Texas Press, Automata Al-Jazari built automated moving peacocks driven by hydropower.al-Jazari (Islamic artist), Encyclopædia Britannica. He also invented the earliest known automatic gates, which were driven by hydropower, created automatic doors as part of one of his elaborate water clocks, and invented water wheels with cams on their axle used to operate automata. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the Italian Renaissance inventor Leonardo da Vinci may have been influenced by the classic automata of al- Jazari. Mark E. Rosheim summarizes the advances in robotics made by Muslim engineers, especially al-Jazari, as follows: =Drink-serving waitress= One of al-Jazari's humanoid automata was a waitress that could serve water, tea or drinks. The drink was stored in a tank with a reservoir from where the drink drips into a bucket and, after seven minutes, into a cup, after which the waitress appears out of an automatic door serving the drink. =Hand-washing automaton with flush mechanism= Al-Jazari invented a hand washing automaton incorporating a flush mechanism now used in modern flush toilets. This device is another example of humanoid automata. It consisted of a human figure, made from jointed copper, holding a pitcher resembling a peacock in its right hand. The pitcher is made from brass and holds within it a chamber, divided into two parts by a metal plate. This mechanism aided the pouring of the water from the spout so that it was smooth and would not splutter. The reservoir in which the water is held is situated within the right-hand side of the human figure. An axle is fitted into the right elbow of the human figure so as to allow the liquid to pour from the reservoir through the spout of the pitcher. The left arm of the figure had a fixed weight which would raise and lower the arm which would hold a towel, comb and mirror. This automaton was designed to aid the king whilst he performed his ritual ablutions. A servant of the king would carry the figure and place it next to a basin that could hold liquid. The servant then turned a knob on the back of the figure which opened a valve resulting in the pouring of water from the right hand of the figure into the basin. When the reservoir is nearly empty and most of the water has been poured a mechanism is prompted and the left hand of the figure, holding the towel, comb and mirror, is extended out in the direction of the king so that he can dry himself and tend to his beard. =Peacock fountain with automated servants= Water and its usages holds particular importance in Islam; both as being an integral part of the pre-prayer washing processes wudu and ghusl, and a key feature in Islamic gardens – four fountains featuring in the Paradise Garden; the Islamic final resting place referenced in the Quran. Additionally, with Mesopotania being a naturally drought-ridden place, machines relating to water held a significant function; in both a divine and practical sense. An entire section of The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices was devoted to fountain mechanisms, titled: ‘On the construction in pools of fountains which change their shape, and of machines for the perpetual flute’. Al-Jazari's \\"peacock fountain\\" was a more sophisticated hand washing device featuring humanoid automata as servants which offer soap and towels. Mark E. Rosheim describes it as follows: Al-Jazari's Peacock Fountain The basin of the \\"peacock fountain\\" formed the basin for performing wudu, and it would have been operated by a servant, who would have pulled the plug and positioned the peacock's beak; allowing the mechanism to release the water into the basin in front of the user. However, whilst water moving objects such as the peacock fountain had ritualistic usage, there is suggestion that water-moving hydraulics were put to profane use. Ayhan Aytes suggests that: > Many of the devices also had additional functions that contradicted divine > omnipotence. The most profane purpose of several of his hydraulic and > pnuematic automata was to get guests at parties drunk as quickly as > possible. =Musical robot band= Al-Jazari's musical robot band. Al-Jazari's work described fountains and musical automata, in which the flow of water alternated from one large tank to another at hourly or half-hourly intervals. This operation was achieved through his innovative use of hydraulic switching. Al-Jazari created a musical automaton, which was a boat with four automatic musicians that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties. Professor Noel Sharkey has argued that it is quite likely that it was an early programmable automata and has produced a possible reconstruction of the mechanism; it has a programmable drum machine with pegs (cams) that bump into little levers that operated the percussion. The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around.Professor Noel Sharkey, A 13th Century Programmable Robot (Archive), University of Sheffield. =The water-clock of the drummers= The water-clock of the drummers The water-clock of the drummers, which differs from the Musical robot band in that it lacks a flute-playing doll and instead has two trumpeters, consists of seven wood-jointed male figures, including the aforementioned trumpeters as well as two dolls playing cymbals and the rest playing other percussive instruments.The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices by Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari Translated by Donald R. Hill, 01-01-1974 The mechanism in this specific automaton serves as a clock by producing a musical output once every hour, illustrating Al-Jazari’s ability to create multi-faceted automata that functioned on a practical and entertainment level. The motion of the automaton is initiated at daybreak by another male doll, who stands at the edge of the frieze element of the design, moving across until he reaches a specific point at which a carved falcon leans forward dropping a ball from its beak onto a cymbal.2\\\\. Prehistory of Musical Robots, Michael Krzyzaniak, Arizona State University, School of Arts, Media and Engineering https://michaelkrzyzaniak.com/Research/PrehistoryMusicalRobots.pdf All mechanical aspects of the automaton are then driven by water and a series of pistons and cables. Each hour water drains out of the main cistern to cause another bucket to tip over driving a water wheel that is connected to the musicians. The automaton is described to ‘perform a with a clamorous sound which is heard from afar’ and could play several different tunes.2\\\\. Prehistory of Musical Robots, Michael Krzyzaniak, Arizona State University, School of Arts, Media and Engineering https://michaelkrzyzaniak.com/Research/PrehistoryMusicalRobots.pdf Like many other automatons by Al-Jazari, this was created to entertain guests at the royal palace. Clocks Al-Jazari constructed a variety of water clocks and candle clocks. These included a portable water-powered scribe clock, which was a meter high and half a meter wide, reconstructed successfully at the Science Museum in 1976Donald Hill (1996), A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times, Routledge, p. 224Ibn al-Razzaz Al-Jazari (ed. 1974) The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices, Translated and annotated by Donald Hill, Dordrecht / D. Reidel, part II. Al-Jazari also invented monumental water-powered astronomical clocks which displayed moving models of the Sun, Moon, and stars. =Candle clocks= candle clocks. According to Donald Hill, al-Jazari described the most sophisticated candle clocks known to date. Hill described one of al-Jazari's candle clocks as follows: Al-Jazari's candle clock also included a dial to display the time and, for the first time, employed a bayonet fitting, a fastening mechanism still used in modern times. =Elephant clock= The elephant clock described by al-Jazari in 1206 is notable for several innovations. It was the first clock in which an automaton reacted after certain intervals of time (in this case, a humanoid robot striking the cymbal and a mechanical robotic bird chirping) and the first water clock to accurately record the passage of the temporal hours to match the uneven length of days throughout the year. Automatic castle clock of al- Jazari, 14th century copy. =Castle clock= Al-Jazari's largest astronomical clock was the \\"castle clock\\", which was a complex device that was about high, and had multiple functions besides timekeeping. It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and lunar orbits, and an innovative feature of the device was a pointer in the shape of the crescent moon which travelled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart, and caused automatic doors to open, each revealing a mannequin, every hour.Howard R. Turner (1997), Science in Medieval Islam: An Illustrated Introduction, p. 184. University of Texas Press, . Another innovative feature was the ability to reprogram the length of day and night in order to account for their changes throughout the year. Another feature of the device was five automata musicians who automatically play music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a water wheel. Other components of the castle clock included a main reservoir with a float, a float chamber and flow regulator, plate and valve trough, two pulleys, crescent disc displaying the zodiac, and two falcon automata dropping balls into vases. Al-Jazari's castle clock is considered to be the earliest programmable analog computer. =Weight-driven water clocks= Al-Jazari invented water clocks that were driven by both water and weights. These included geared clocks and a portable water-powered scribe clock, which was a meter high and half a meter wide. The scribe with his pen was synonymous to the hour hand of a modern clock. Al-Jazari's famous water-powered scribe clock was reconstructed successfully at the Science Museum, London in 1976. Miniature paintings Alongside his accomplishments as an inventor and engineer, al-Jazari was also an accomplished artist. In The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices, he gave instructions of his inventions and illustrated them using miniature paintings, a medieval style of Islamic art.

Sir Percivale took part in the Falklands War and the 1991 Gulf War. Background She originally entered British Army service in 1968, managed for the Ministry of Transport by British India Steam Navigation Company, but was taken over by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary along with the other members of the class in 1970. Operational history =Falklands War= The first twelve years of the ship's life were quiet, with some time spent in the Pacific, until the Falklands War broke out in April 1982. Along with all the Navy's other amphibious assault shipping, Sir Percivale went south to participate in the recapture of the Falkland Islands. At this time, all the RFA were manned by Hong Kong Chinese civilian crew. She pioneered the supply runs to Teal Inlet and was the first British ship to re-enter Stanley Harbour. Unlike the Sir Galahad, Sir Tristram and Sir Lancelot, the ship emerged unscathed from the conflict. =1991-1999= The ship served in the Gulf War in 1991 and twice deployed to the Adriatic to support British operations in the Balkans. In 1996 Sir Percivale took part in combined exercises with Jordan, followed by Green Wader 96, the first exercise of the then newly formed Amphibious Squadron of the Joint Rapid Deployment Force. In 1997, the ship took part in the large Ocean Wave 97 deployment to the far east and was present for the handover of Hong Kong to the Chinese. Following this ceremony, Sir Percivale escorted the ships of the former Hong Kong Squadron (3 Peacock class patrol vessel) to their new owners in the Philippines. During other parts of Ocean Wave, the ship took Royal Marines to Brunei, Singapore and Thailand for various exercises. 1998 saw further exercises as Sir Percivale took part in practice amphibious assaults in Norway, France and Spain. =2000-2004= Sir Percivale, 2004 In 2000, Sir Percivale was deployed to Sierra Leone to support British forces training the army of that country. In September 2000, the ship was alongside in Freetown when British forces who had been taken hostage were rescued in a raid by the Parachute Regiment and the SAS (\\"Operation Barras\\"). Since then the ship has been deployed during operations connected with Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. The ship was to have a SLEP overhaul, but an equivalent overhaul of Sir Bedivere proved so costly that plans were abandoned and new ships were procured instead. Sir Percivale was decommissioned on 17 August 2004 and was laid up alongside at Marchwood Military Port, Southampton. The ship was sold to Leavesley International and scrapping commenced in Canada Dock, Liverpool on 16 December 2009.

The ship saw service in the Falklands War of 1982, and was badly damaged at Fitzroy on 8 June. Early service In January 1972 RFA Sir Tristram was part of an anti-invasion task force for British Honduras, together with Sir Bedivere and Sir Geraint.

On 8 June, while transporting men and equipment to Fitzroy Cove alongside the , Sir Tristram was attacked by A-4 Skyhawks from Argentine Air Force's V Brigada Aérea (FAA), each loaded with three 500 lb Mark 82 bomb.Moro, Rubén Oscar (1985). La guerra inaudita: historia del conflicto del Atlántico Sur. Pleamar, p. 462. . At approximately 14:00 local time the decks were strafed and two crew were killed. A 500 lb bomb penetrated the deck, but failed to explode immediately, allowing the remaining crew to be evacuated. Following the later explosion, Sir Tristram was abandoned. Immediately following the end of the conflict, Sir Tristram was towed to Port Stanley, where she was used as an accommodation ship.http://www.historicalrfa.org/rfa- sir-tristram-ships-details Sir Tristram then returned to the United Kingdom in 1983 on a heavy lift ship and was extensively rebuilt.  Rebuilt Sir Tristram, 2016 Following the rebuild, Sir Tristram re-entered active service in 1985, and saw service in the Gulf War, and the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. The ship supported relief operations for Hurricane Mitch off Central America. In 2000 the ship was deployed to Sierra Leone in support of British operations there, followed by a cruise to the Baltic Sea in support of MCMVs. Early 2001 saw Sir Tristram return to Sierra Leone to take over from Sir Percivale as the ship supporting British forces ashore there. In 2003 the ship was deployed as part of the largest British fleet for 20 years in support of the invasion of Iraq. The ship was decommissioned on 17 December 2005 but continues to be used for training purposes by the Special Boat Service and other elements of UK Special Forces Group.

John was a member of the Kamateros family to which belonged the Empress Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera, wife of Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195–1203). An educated man, well versed in classical literature, rhetoric and philosophy, he occupied a series of ecclesiastical posts reaching the post of chartophylax, which he held at the time of his elevation to the patriarchal throne.Kazhdan (1991), p. 1054 In 1198–1200, he had an exchange of letters with Pope Innocent III on the issue of papal supremacy and the filioque clause. Notably, he disputed Rome's claim to primacy based on St. Peter, and asserted that in reality its primacy came from the fact that Rome was the old imperial capital.Kazhdan (1991), pp. 1054–1055 He intervened in the riots in Constantinople against the arrest of the banker Kalomodios, and secured his release,Kazhdan (1991), pp. 1055, 1096 but during the coup of John Komnenos the Fat on 31 July 1200, he hid in a cupboard as the rebels seized control of the Hagia Sophia. John remained in office after Alexios III's deposition in July 1203, and according to Western sources, both he and Alexios IV Angelos, threatened by the Fourth Crusade, acknowledged papal supremacy in the same year. After the capture of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204, he initially fled to Didymoteichon in Thrace. In 1206, Theodore I Laskaris invited him to Nicaea, where he had established the Empire of Nicaea, a Byzantine Greek successor state, but John refused, perhaps because of his advanced age, and died in April or May of the same year.Kazhdan (1991), p. 1055 The Crusaders then installed a Latin Patriarch in Constantinople, while Theodore simply created a new provisional seat of the Constantinoplitan Ecumenical Patriarchate in Nicaea, which was eventually restored in Constantinople with the rest of the Empire in 1261.

The population is 13,700 (2003). Flores is the seat of the municipality of Flores (population 22,600). Its Catedral Nuestra Señora de Los Remedios y San Pablo Itzá is the cathedral episcopal see of the Apostolic Vicariate of El Petén (formerly a territorial prelature). Catedral Nuestra Señora de Los Remedios y San Pablo Itzá The old part of the city is located on an island on Lake Petén Itzá, connected to the mainland by a short causeway. On the mainland is the suburb Santa Elena and, to the West, the contiguous municipality of San Benito.  History  In Pre-Columbian times, Flores was the Maya city of Nojpetén. = Nojpetén = View of Flores from Lake Peten Itza, Petén The Itza left the Yucatán region in the 13th century and built the city later known as Tayasal as their capital. They called it Nojpetén, (noj peten, literally \\"Great Island\\" in the Itza language).Reina 1966, p. 20. The Spanish called it Tayasal, possibly derived from ta Itza, or \\"Place of the Itza\\".Rice 2009, p. 43. It was here, on the island of Flores on the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, that the last independent Maya state held out against the Spanish conquerors. In 1541, Hernán Cortés came to the island, en route to Honduras, but needed to move on and did not try to conquer it. The Spanish did not manage to conquer the island until 1697, when they marched in, attacked via boats, and destroyed it. Those who could flee did so, and many Itzá people hid in the jungle for years. From the ruins of Nojpetén arose the modern city of Flores. The modern city can thus be regarded as the second oldest continuously inhabited settlement in the Americas, after Cholula.  Transportation  Flores is served by Mundo Maya International Airport. Several international flights land here but most stop first at Guatemala City's La Aurora International Airport. The Island is also very well connected by bus, with many companies running overnight buses to Guatemala City.

It was a large Maya city with a long history of occupation. Tayasal is a corruption of Tah Itza (\\"Place of the Itza\\"), a term originally used to refer to the core of the Itza territory in Petén.Jones et al 1981, p. 531. The name Tayasal was applied in error to the archaeological site, and originally applied to the Itza capital. However, the name now refers to the peninsula supporting both the archaeological site and the village of San Miguel. The site was occupied from the Middle Preclassic period (c. 1000–350 BC) through to the Late Postclassic (c. 1200–1539 AD).Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 6. The site is a protected national monument. Location The Tayasal archaeological site is situated on a peninsula on Lake Petén Itzá a short distance to the north of the modern town of Flores,Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 6. Chan Nieto et al 2012, p. 284. separated from it by a wide stretch of water,Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2010, p. 3. and falls within the municipality of Flores, in the department of Petén in northern Guatemala. The site covers an area of approximately . The southern portion of the peninsula also hosts the modern village of San Miguel, which probably covers a portion of the Postclassic occupation of the site. The peninsula fell within the core of the Postclassic Itza territory. The protected area of the archaeological site is defined by the lakeshore to the north and west, and by the modern village of San Miguel to the south and east. Site history Remains of a structure on the main plaza The Tayasal peninsula showed intense activity during the Late Preclassic (c. 400 BC - 250 AD).Chan Nieto et al 2012, pp. 283-4. At this time, the city fully reflected ongoing developments in the Maya region, such as monumental architecture that included typical Preclassic Maya architectural forms such as the triadic pyramid and the E-Group ceremonial complex.Chan Nieto et al 2012, pp. 284-5. Activity at the site continued right through to the Postclassic period. Investigations have identified that most Postclassic and colonial activity was concentrated on the southern shore of the peninsula.Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, pp. 6-7. Very little is known about the use of the peninsula during the time of first contact with the Spanish, although early colonial accounts reported that the Itza frequently conducted rituals there. Evidence of Spanish contact includes a musketball excavated at the site. In 1702 and 1703, shortly after the Spanish conquest of Petén, Spanish missions were established on the Tayasal peninsula at San Miguel and San Bernabé,Pugh et al 2012, p. 625. although the population of San Bernabé dropped off sharply through the course of the 18th century due to high infant mortality.Pugh et al 2012, p. 626. =Modern history= The Tayasal archaeological site was declared a national monument in 1931. The University of Pennsylvania mapped the site in 1971, and its limits were defined by the Instituto de Antropología e Historia (Institute of Anthropology and History) in 1994.Chan Nieto et al 2012, p. 284. Tayasal has been excavated sporadically since the 1920s, beginning with Guthe's excavations in 1921-1922,Chase 1985, p. 193. continuing with Morley's dig in 1937 to 1938, by several others in the 1950s and 60s.Chase 1979, pp. 86-119. The University of Pennsylvania undertook excavations in 1971, and again in 1977. The Proyecto Maya Colonial undertook a month-long investigation of the site in 1996.Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 8. The Proyecto Arqueológico Tayasal was launched in 2009, with particular emphasis on the period of contact with the Spanish, and the early colonial years.Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2010, p. 4. The project also remapped the site with the objective of correcting any errors from the 1971 mapping project.Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2010, p. 12. Site description The Mirador del rey Can'Ek was a triadic pyramid dating to the Late Preclassic The University of Pennsylvania project mapped 339 structures; the city possessed large open plazas, palaces, pyramid-temples, an acropolis, defensive walls, residential buildings, and a cenote. As many as fifty burials and twelve caches have been recovered from Tayasal.Chase 1983. The site core includes a number of large structures dating to the Classic period.Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 7. Mirador del rey Can'Ek \\"King Kan Ek's Lookout\\" (Structures T65-T67) was a triadic pyramid, consisting of a massive pyramidal platform with a single access stairway, supporting two lesser structures flanking a principal structure. This architectural form dates it to the Late Preclassic. It was built on the higher portion of the peninsula. Cerro Moo (Structures T256-T258) was another triadic pyramid, dating to the Late Preclassic, also built on the higher ground of the peninsula. Group 23 is located to the southwest of the acropolis. It appears to have been built in the Late Preclassic as an E-Group. The E-Group axis is oriented 9° to the south of the east-west line, leading investigators to conclude that it was never used as an astronomical observatory as at other sites, but rather served a purely ceremonial function. It consists of a radial structure to the west and a long basal platform to the east that supported three buildings.Chan Nieto et al 2012, p. 285. At Tayasal, the radial structure appears to have been covered by later construction, including a group of structures dating to the Late Postclassic.Chan Nieto et al 2012, p. 285. Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2010, p. 24. =San Bernabé= The San Bernabé portion of the site occupies the northwestern area of the Tayasal peninsula. Various structures in this area have been dated to the Late Preclassic.Chan Nieto et all 2012, pp. 286-287. After the Spanish conquest, San Bernabé was one of two Spanish missions established on the peninsula. Structure T29 was a platform measuring and has a height of . It was built in the Late Preclassic and was reused in the Postclassic. It continued in use into the colonial period,Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 14. and excavators recovered a number of colonial artefacts around the structure, including a silver Spanish coin, probably a real, Maiolica pottery, a lead bullet.Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, pp. 15-17. It is likely that the platform supported a colonial-period residence.Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 17. Structure T30 was a circular structure in the northwestern portion of the site. It was elongated, measuring east-west by north-south, and stood high. It dates to the Preclassic, and served as the basal platform for four structures (denominated T-30a to T30d).Chan Nieto et al 2012, p. 286. Structure T30a is a circular platform measuring across, and standing high. Its wall consists of three courses of soft limestone blocks, and its fill consists of a mix of soil and small stones. Recovered potsherds are dated to the Late Preclassic Chicanel Phase. A number of ritual deposits were excavated that date to the Late to Terminal Classic period, indicating continued use of the platform long after its construction. Although the majority of the building's fill was Late Preclassic, the fill on the east side was dated to the Terminal Classic.Pugh and Sánchez Polo 2011, p. 19. Estrada-Belli 2007, p. 40. Iconography Tayasal iconography is typical of Maya artefacts found in the surrounding Petén region that date approximately to the same time period. Examples of the imagery can be found on three excavated vases. The vases accompanied an individual who was interred at Tayasal during the Terminal Classic period; circa 8th century AD.Chase 1985, p. 194.Chase 1985, pp. 193-201. The vases' images are thought to represent the elite status concerns, similar to those as depicted on carved stelae at neighbouring sites.

It is from and from ; it is on both the South Western main line and Brighton main line as well as numerous other routes and branch lines passing through or diverging from the main lines at this station. Despite its name, Clapham Junction is not located in Clapham, a district situated approximately to the south-east. Routes from London's south and south-west termini, Victoria and Waterloo, funnel through the station, making it the busiest in EuropeGreat British Railway Journeys (Series 4, Episode 7): \\"Woking to Clapham Junction\\" BBC Two, 15 January 2013 by number of trains using it: between 100 and 180 per hour except for the five hours after midnight. The station is also the busiest UK station for interchanges between services,Office of Rail Regulation, Station Usage Estimates 2011–12 and the only railway station in Great Britain with more interchanges than entries or exits. History On 21 May 1838 the London and Southampton Railway became the London and South Western Railway (L&SWR;), and opened its line from as far as Woking. Details of roof support columns The second line, initially from Nine Elms to Richmond, opened on 27 July 1846. Nine Elms was replaced in 1848 as the terminus by Waterloo Bridge station, now Waterloo. The line to Victoria opened by 1860. Clapham Junction opened on 2 March 1863, a joint venture of the L&SWR;, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) and the West London Extension Railway (WLER) as an interchange station for their lines.The west London Railway and the W.L.E.R, H.V.Borley & R.W.Kidner, 1981 reprint, The Oakwood Press, Usk Monmouthshire. The railway companies, to attract a middle- and upper-class clientele, seized the nonindustrial parish calculating that being upon the slopes of Clapham's plateau would only reinforce this distinction, leading to a long-lasting misunderstanding that the station is in Clapham.Year's Art, published 1922, London, p. 500Directory of British Architects, 1834–1914: Vol. 2 (L-Z) A.

Overground, the change would have been at Clapham Junction. =Incidents and accidents= Clapham rail disaster On the morning of 12 December 1988, two collisions involving three commuter trains occurred slightly south west of the station due to a defective signal. Thirty-five people died and more than 100 were injured. Track bombing On the morning of 16 December 1991, a bomb ripped through tracks on one of the station's platforms, causing major disruption to the rail network. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) claimed responsibility. The Junction A 1912 Railway Clearing House map of lines around Clapham Junction. The station is named Clapham Junction because it is at the junction of several rail lines. The name is not given to any rail junction near the station which, without end-on intercompany junctions, are: * Falcon Junction at the south end of the station, where the West London Line (WLL) joins the Brighton Slow Lines * Ludgate Junction at the eastern end of the Windsor Line platforms to the WLL * Latchmere SW Junction connecting the WLL to the Windsor lines at Ludgate Junction. * Latchmere Main Junction connecting the WLL to the Brighton Line at Falcon Junction. * West London Extension Junction and Junction for Waterloo, relaid for Eurostar empty-stock moves from the Windsor Lines to the WLL. * Pouparts Junction where the low-level and high-level approaches to Victoria split. The station today Each day more than 2,000 trains, over half of them stopping, pass through the station, more than through any other station in Europe.\\"Great British Railway Journeys (Series 4, Episode 7): Woking to Clapham Junction\\" BBC2, UK TV Channel, 15/01/13 At peak times up to 200 trains per hour pass through of which 122 stop. It is not the busiest station by number of passengers, most of whom (about 430,000 on a weekday, of which 135,000 are at rush hours) pass through. Interchanges make some 40% of the activity and on that basis too it is the busiest station in the UK.Delta Rail, 2008–09 station usage report, Office of the Rail Regulation website In 2011 the station had three entrances, all with staffed ticket offices, though only the south-east entrance is open 24 hours a day. The most heavily used of the three, this leads from St John's Hill via a small indoor shopping centre into a subway some wide, that connects to the eastern ends of all platforms. The north entrance, which has restricted opening hours, leads from the Winstanley Estate on Grant Road to the same subway. The subway is crowded during rush hours, with the ticket barriers at the ends being pinch points. The south-west entrance, also known as the Brighton Yard entrance, as the buildings still bear signage for the London Brighton and South Coast Railway, is of a more traditional appearance, with a Victorian station building set at the back of a large forecourt. This entrance leads to a very wide covered footbridge, which joins the western ends of all platforms. This entrance includes cycle parking and a taxi rank. It was re-opened in May 2011 as part of a wider programme of access improvements that included installing lifts to the platforms.Route Plans 2007 – Route 3 – South West Main line published by Network Rail, 2007 – See page 20 There are public and disabled toilets at the south-west entrance. There are refreshment kiosks in the subway, on the footbridge and on some platforms; and a small shopping centre, including a small branch of Sainsbury's supermarket, in the south-east entrance. British Transport Police maintain a neighbourhood policing presence, whereas the Metropolitan Police Service and the part-Transport for London funded Safer Transport Command provides a police presence in the area outside the station. 9 December 2012 saw the opening of a new platform for the East London Line, creating an orbital railway around inner London. Overcrowding is most frequent in the often convenient but narrow cross-platform subway. Using this rather than the wide, elegant flying concourse for interchange, a visitors' eyes assessment of fabric and environment listed Clapham Junction in the most needy 10% of Department for Transport category B stations. =Platforms= The subway at Clapham Junction during the night. The station has 17 platforms, 1 to 17: * Platforms 1 and 2 are northeast-facing bay platforms, used by the London Overground services to and from and . Usually, platform 1 is served by trains via on the West London line, while platform 2 is used by services via on the South London line, although this usage can be reversed. * Platforms 3 to 6 are through platforms used by South Western Railway services going to or from and beyond. Sidings leading into railway sheds at the west of the station are located between platforms 6 and 7. * Platforms 7 to 11 are through platforms used by South Western Railway services going to or from and beyond.

Bruun in 1978 and generalized to arbitrary even composite sizes by H. Murakami in 1996. Because its operations involve only real coefficients until the last computation stage, it was initially proposed as a way to efficiently compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of real data. Bruun's algorithm has not seen widespread use, however, as approaches based on the ordinary Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm have been successfully adapted to real data with at least as much efficiency. Furthermore, there is evidence that Bruun's algorithm may be intrinsically less accurate than Cooley–Tukey in the face of finite numerical precision (Storn, 1993). Nevertheless, Bruun's algorithm illustrates an alternative algorithmic framework that can express both itself and the Cooley–Tukey algorithm, and thus provides an interesting perspective on FFTs that permits mixtures of the two algorithms and other generalizations.  A polynomial approach to the DFT  Recall that the DFT is defined by the formula: :X_k = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{N} nk } \\\\qquad k = 0,\\\\dots,N-1. For convenience, let us denote the N roots of unity by ωNn (n = 0, ..., N − 1): :\\\\omega_N^n = e^{-\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{N} n } and define the polynomial x(z) whose coefficients are xn: :x(z) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n z^n. The DFT can then be understood as a reduction of this polynomial; that is, Xk is given by: :X_k = x(\\\\omega_N^k) = x(z) \\\\mod (z - \\\\omega_N^k) where mod denotes the polynomial remainder operation. The key to fast algorithms like Bruun's or Cooley–Tukey comes from the fact that one can perform this set of N remainder operations in recursive stages.  Recursive factorizations and FFTs  In order to compute the DFT, we need to evaluate the remainder of x(z) modulo N degree-1 polynomials as described above. Evaluating these remainders one by one is equivalent to the evaluating the usual DFT formula directly, and requires O(N2) operations. However, one can combine these remainders recursively to reduce the cost, using the following trick: if we want to evaluate x(z) modulo two polynomials U(z) and V(z), we can first take the remainder modulo their product U(z) V(z), which reduces the degree of the polynomial x(z) and makes subsequent modulo operations less computationally expensive. The product of all of the monomials (z - \\\\omega_N^k) for k=0..N-1 is simply z^N-1 (whose roots are clearly the N roots of unity). One then wishes to find a recursive factorization of z^N-1 into polynomials of few terms and smaller and smaller degree. To compute the DFT, one takes x(z) modulo each level of this factorization in turn, recursively, until one arrives at the monomials and the final result. If each level of the factorization splits every polynomial into an O(1) (constant-bounded) number of smaller polynomials, each with an O(1) number of nonzero coefficients, then the modulo operations for that level take O(N) time; since there will be a logarithmic number of levels, the overall complexity is O (N log N). More explicitly, suppose for example that z^N-1 = F_1(z) F_2(z) F_3(z), and that F_k(z) = F_{k,1}(z) F_{k,2}(z), and so on. The corresponding FFT algorithm would consist of first computing xk(z) = x(z) mod Fk(z), then computing xk,j(z) = xk(z) mod Fk,j(z), and so on, recursively creating more and more remainder polynomials of smaller and smaller degree until one arrives at the final degree-0 results. Moreover, as long as the polynomial factors at each stage are relatively prime (which for polynomials means that they have no common roots), one can construct a dual algorithm by reversing the process with the Chinese Remainder Theorem. =Cooley–Tukey as polynomial factorization= The standard decimation-in-frequency (DIF) radix-r Cooley–Tukey algorithm corresponds closely to a recursive factorization. For example, radix-2 DIF Cooley–Tukey factors z^N-1 into F_1 = (z^{N/2}-1) and F_2 = (z^{N/2}+1). These modulo operations reduce the degree of x(z) by 2, which corresponds to dividing the problem size by 2. Instead of recursively factorizing F_2 directly, though, Cooley–Tukey instead first computes x2(z ωN), shifting all the roots (by a twiddle factor) so that it can apply the recursive factorization of F_1 to both subproblems. That is, Cooley–Tukey ensures that all subproblems are also DFTs, whereas this is not generally true for an arbitrary recursive factorization (such as Bruun's, below).  The Bruun factorization  The basic Bruun algorithm for powers of two N=2n factorizes z2n-1 recursively via the rules: :z^{2M}-1 = (z^M - 1) (z^M + 1) \\\\, :z^{4M} + az^{2M} + 1 = (z^{2M} + \\\\sqrt{2-a}z^M+1) (z^{2M} - \\\\sqrt{2-a}z^M + 1) where a is a real constant with a ≤ 2. If a=2\\\\cos(\\\\phi), \\\\phi\\\\in(0,\\\\pi), then \\\\sqrt{2+a}=2\\\\cos\\\\tfrac\\\\phi2 and \\\\sqrt{2-a}=2\\\\cos(\\\\tfrac\\\\pi 2-\\\\tfrac\\\\phi 2). At stage s, s=0,1,2,n-1, the intermediate state consists of 2s polynomials p_{s,0},\\\\dots,p_{s,2^s-1} of degree 2n-s \\\\- 1 or less , where :\\\\begin{align} p_{s,0}(z)&= p(z) \\\\mod \\\\left(z^{2^{n-s}}-1\\\\right)&\\\\quad&\\\\text{and}\\\\\\\\\\\\ p_{s,m}(z) &= p(z)\\\\mod \\\\left(z^{2^{n-s}}-2\\\\cos\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{m}{2^s}\\\\pi\\\\right)z^{2^{n-1-s}}+1\\\\right)&m;&=1,2,\\\\dots,2^s-1 \\\\end{align} By the construction of the factorization of z2n-1, the polynomials ps,m(z) each encode 2n-s values :X_k=p(e^{2\\\\pi i\\\\tfrac{k}{2^n}}) of the Fourier transform, for m=0, the covered indices are k=0, 2k, 2∙2s, 3∙2s,…, (2n-s-1)∙2s, for m>0 the covered indices are k=m, 2s+1-m, 2s+1+m, 2∙2s+1-m, 2∙2s+1+m, …, 2n-m. During the transition to the next stage, the polynomial p_{s,\\\\ell}(z) is reduced to the polynomials p_{s+1,\\\\ell}(z) and p_{s+1,2^s-\\\\ell}(z) via polynomial division. If one wants to keep the polynomials in increasing index order, this pattern requires an implementation with two arrays. An implementation in place produces a predictable, but highly unordered sequence of indices, for example for N=16 the final order of the 8 linear remainders is (0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 5). At the end of the recursion, for s=n-1, there remain 2n-1 linear polynomials encoding two Fourier coefficients X0 and X2n-1 for the first and for the any other kth polynomial the coefficients Xk and X2n-k. At each recursive stage, all of the polynomials of the common degree 4M-1 are reduced to two parts of half the degree 2M-1. The divisor of this polynomial remainder computation is a quadratic polynomial zm, so that all reductions can be reduced to polynomial divisions of cubic by quadratic polynomials. There are N/2=2n-1 of these small divisions at each stage, leading to an O (N log N) algorithm for the FFT. Moreover, since all of these polynomials have purely real coefficients (until the very last stage), they automatically exploit the special case where the inputs xn are purely real to save roughly a factor of two in computation and storage. One can also take straightforward advantage of the case of real-symmetric data for computing the discrete cosine transform (Chen and Sorensen, 1992). = Generalization to arbitrary radices = The Bruun factorization, and thus the Bruun FFT algorithm, was generalized to handle arbitrary even composite lengths, i.e. dividing the polynomial degree by an arbitrary radix (factor), as follows. First, we define a set of polynomials φN,α(z) for positive integers N and for α in [0,1) by: :\\\\phi_{N, \\\\alpha}(z) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} z^{2N} - 2 \\\\cos (2 \\\\pi \\\\alpha) z^N + 1 & \\\\mbox{if } 0 < \\\\alpha < 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ z^{2N} - 1 & \\\\mbox{if } \\\\alpha = 0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right. Note that all of the polynomials that appear in the Bruun factorization above can be written in this form. The zeroes of these polynomials are e^{2\\\\pi i ( \\\\pm\\\\alpha + k ) / N} for k=0,1,\\\\dots,N-1 in the \\\\alpha eq 0 case, and e^{2\\\\pi i k / 2N} for k=0,1,\\\\dots,2N-1 in the \\\\alpha=0 case. Hence these polynomials can be recursively factorized for a factor (radix) r via: :\\\\phi_{rM, \\\\alpha}(z) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{ll} \\\\prod_{\\\\ell=0}^{r-1} \\\\phi_{M,(\\\\alpha+\\\\ell)/r} & \\\\mbox{if } 0 < \\\\alpha \\\\leq 0.5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\prod_{\\\\ell=0}^{r-1} \\\\phi_{M,(1-\\\\alpha+\\\\ell)/r} & \\\\mbox{if } 0.5 < \\\\alpha < 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\prod_{\\\\ell=0}^{r-1} \\\\phi_{M,\\\\ell/(2r)} & \\\\mbox{if } \\\\alpha = 0 \\\\end{array} \\\\right.

He served in the court of Emperor Leo IV the Khazar before taking up the religious life. Theophanes attended the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 and resisted the iconoclasm of Leo V the Armenian, for which he was imprisoned. He died shortly after his release. Theophanes is venerated on March 12 in the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. (He should not be confused with Theophanes of Nicaea, whose is commemorated on October 11.) Biography Theophanes was born in Constantinople of wealthy and noble iconodule parents: Isaac, governor of the islands of the Aegean Sea, and Theodora, of whose family nothing is known. His father died when Theophanes was three years old, and the Byzantine Emperor Constantine V (740–775) subsequently saw to the boy's education and upbringing at the imperial court. Theophanes would hold several offices under Leo IV the Khazar.\\"Venerable Theophanes the Confessor of Sigriane\\", Pravoslavie He was married at the age of twelve, but convinced his wife to lead a life of virginity. In 779, after the death of his father-in- law, they separated with mutual consent to embrace the religious life. She chose a convent on an island near Constantinople, while he entered the Polychronius Monastery, located in the district of Sigiane (Sigriano), near Cyzicus on the Asian side of the Sea of Marmara. Later, he built a monastery on his own lands on the island of Calonymus (now Calomio) https://www.vintage- maps.com/en/antique-maps/europe/greece/bordone-greece-aegean-kalymnos- astypalaia-leros-patmos::12222 , where he acquired a high degree of skill in transcribing manuscripts. After six years he returned to Sigriano, where he founded an abbey known by the name \\"of the big settlement\\" and governed it as abbot. In this position of leadership, he was present at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, and signed its decrees in defense of the veneration of icons. When Emperor Leo V the Armenian (813–820) resumed his iconoclastic warfare, he ordered Theophanes brought to Constantinople. The Emperor tried in vain to induce him to condemn the same veneration of icons that had been sanctioned by the council. Theophanes was cast into prison and for two years suffered cruel treatment. After his release, he was banished to Samothrace in 817, where overwhelmed with afflictions, he lived only seventeen days. He is credited with many miracles that occurred after his death, which most likely took place on 12 March, the day he is commemorated in the Roman Martyrology. Chronicle At the urgent request of his friend George Syncellus, Theophanes undertook the continuation of Syncellus' Chronicle (, Chronographia), during the years 810 to 815. citing P.G., CVIII, 55 The language used occupies a place midway between the stiff ecclesiastical and the vernacular Greek.He arguably made use of three main sources: first, material already prepared by Syncellus; second, he probably made the use of a set of extracts made by Theodore Lector from the works of Socrates Scholasticus, Sozomenus, and Theodoret; and third, the city chronicle of Constantinople. Cyril Mango has argued that Theophanes contributed but little to the chronicle that bears his name, and that the vast bulk of its contents are the work of Syncellus; on this model, Theophanes' main contribution was to cast Syncellus' rough materials together in a unified form. Theophanes' part of the chronicle covered events from the accession of Diocletian in 284 (which is the point where the chronicle of George Syncellus ends) to the downfall of Michael I Rhangabes in 813. This part of the chronicle is valuable for having preserved the accounts of lost authorities on Byzantine history for the seventh and eighth centuries that would be otherwise have been lost.\\"Venerable Theophanes the Confessor of Sigriane\\", Orthodox Church in America The work consists of two parts, wherein the first provides a chronological history arranged per annum, and the second contains chronological tables that are regrettably full of inaccuracies. It seems that Theophanes had only prepared the tables, leaving vacant spaces for the proper dates, but that these had been filled out by someone else (Hugo von Hurter, Nomenlator literarius recentioris I, Innsbruck, 1903, 735). In the chronological first part, in addition to reckoning by the years of the world and the Christian era, Theophanes introduces in tabular form the regnal years of the Roman emperors, of the Persian kings and Arab caliphs, and of the five ecumenical patriarchs, a system which leads to considerable confusion, and therefore of little value. The first part, though lacking in critical insight and chronological accuracy, greatly surpasses the majority of Byzantine chronicles. citing . Theophanes's Chronicle is particularly valuable beginning with the reign of Justin II (565), as in his work, he then drew upon sources that have not survived his times citing Traianus Patricius, Theophilus of Edessa. Theophanes' Chronicle was much used by succeeding chroniclers, and in 873–875 a Latin compilation was made notes that it was published in vol. ii. of De Boor's edition. by the papal librarian Anastasius from the chronicles of Nicephorus, George Syncellus, and Theophanes for the use of a deacon named Johannes in the second half of the ninth century and thus was known to Western Europe. There also survives a further continuation, in six books, of the Chronicle down to the year 961 written by a number of mostly anonymous writers (called Theophanes Continuatus or Scriptores post Theophanem), who undertook the work at the instructions of Constantine Porphyrogenitus.

A general in the Guatemalan army, he was elected to the presidency in 1931, in an election where he was the only candidate. He continued his predecessors' policies of giving massive concessions to the United Fruit Company and wealthy landowners, as well as supporting their harsh labor practices. Ubico has been described as \\"one of the most oppressive tyrants Guatemala has ever known\\" who compared himself to Adolf Hitler. He was removed by a pro-democracy uprising in 1944, which led to the ten-year Guatemalan Revolution. Early years Arturo Ubico Urruela, father of General Ubico. Jorge Ubico was the son of Arturo Ubico Urruela, a lawyer and politician of the Guatemalan liberal party. Ubico Urruela was a member of the legislature that wrote the Guatemalan Constitution of 1879, and was subsequently the president of the Guatemalan Congress during the government of Manuel Estrada Cabrera (1898-1920). Jorge Ubico was privately tutored, and attended some of Guatemala's most prestigious schools, as well as receiving further education in the United States and Europe. By 1897 Ubico received his commission into the Guatemalan army as a second lieutenant, a commission which was largely due to his political connections. He rapidly established himself in the army and rose through the ranks, and, after a military campaign against El Salvador, held the rank of colonel at the age of 28. A year later, he was made the governor (jefe politico) of the province of Alta Verapaz, followed four years later as governor of Retalhuleu. During his tenure, he oversaw improvements in public works, the school system, public health, and youth organizations. In 1918, he drained swamps, ordered fumigation and distributed free medicine to combat a yellow fever epidemic, and won the praise of Major General William C. Gorgas, who had done the same in Panama. However, most of his reputation came from his harsh but effective punishment of banditry and smuggling across the Mexican border. He returned to Guatemala City in 1921 to participate in a coup that installed General José Orellana into the presidency, after the sitting president Carlos Herrera y Luna refused to ratify the concessions that Estrada Cabrera had made to the United Fruit Company. Under Orellana he was appointed Secretary of War in 1922, but quit a year later. In 1926, after the death of President Orellana, Ubico ran unsuccessfully for president as the candidate of the Political Progressive Party. He temporarily retired to his farm until the next election. Guatemalan instability National Police Headquarters during Ubico's regime. On December 1930, President Lazaro Chacón was forced to resign after having a stroke. By that time, Guatemala was in the midst of the Great Depression and bankrupt; Chacón's successor, Baudilio Palma, was deposed by a coup d'etat after only four days in office and was replaced by Gral. Manuel María Orellana. The United States opposed the new government and demanded Orellana resign; he was forced to leave the presidency in favor of José María Reina Andrade. Election  The Liberal Party allied with the Progressives to nominate Ubico as Andrade's successor, in an election where Ubico was the only candidate on the ballot. In February 1931 he was elected with 305,841 votes. In his inaugural address, he pledged a \\"march toward civilization\\". Once in office, he began a campaign of efficiency which included assuming dictatorial powers.  Government  = Military dictatorship = Ubico's rule has been characterized as totalitarian;Grieb, p. 42 John Gunther, who visited the country during 1941, described Guatemala as \\"a country 100 per cent dominated by a single man.\\"Gunther, John. Inside Latin America (1941), p. 118 Added Gunther: \\"He [Ubico] has spies and agents everywhere, and knows everyone's private business to an amazing degree. Not a pin drops in Guatemala without his knowing it.\\"Gunther, p. 120 Guatemala under Ubico was likened to \\"a modern jail.\\"Nyrop, Richard F. (ed.), Guatemala: A Country Study (1983), p. 21 He militarized numerous political and social institutions—including the post office, schools, and symphony orchestras—and placed military officers in charge of many government posts. He frequently traveled around the country performing \\"inspections\\" in dress uniform followed by a military escort, a mobile radio station, an official biographer, and cabinet members. = UFCO and relations with the US = Ubico considered Guatemala to be the closest ally of the United States in Central America. Adopting a pro-USA stance to promote economic development and recovery from depression, the United Fruit Company under Ubico became the most important company in Guatemala. It received import duty and real estate tax exemptions from the government and controlled more land than any other group or individual. It also controlled the sole railroad in the country, the sole facilities capable of producing electricity, and the port facilities at Puerto Barrios on the Atlantic coast. = Relations with Germany = As part of a goodwill worldwide tour promoting the Berlin 1936 Summer Olympics, in January of that year the German light cruiser Emden arrived to Guatemala. Its crew travelled by train to Guatemala City where they paraded in front of Ubico's Army staff and the general public. = Middle class = While the middle class grew substantially during Ubico's regime,Grieb, Kenneth J. Guatemalan Caudillo: The Regime of Jorge Ubico (1979), p. 282 the basic character of the regime remained oligarchical and his regime primarily benefited the landowning class.Griev, p. 34 The country's middle class, resentful of its exclusion from the government, later spearheaded the democratic revolution that removed Ubico from power.Grieb, p. 270-271 = Napoleon = Ubico considered himself to be \\"another Napoleon\\". He admired Napoleon Bonaparte extravagantly and preferred to have his photograph taken in his general's uniform. Although he was much taller and fatter than his hero, Ubico believed that he resembled Bonaparte, and his nickname was \\"the Little Napoleon of the Tropics\\". He dressed ostentatiously and surrounded himself with statues and paintings of Napoleon, regularly commenting on the similarities between their appearances. = Praise = Jorge Ubico in 1933. Ubico was commended by both his defenders and his detractors for his personal integrity and for virtually eliminating corruption in Guatemala;Grieb, p. 13Nyrop, p. 21 anyone found guilty of corruption was \\"instantly\\" and \\"severely\\"United States Office of Inter-American Affairs, Guatemala: Volcanic But Peaceful (1943), p. 10 punished. The so-called Probity Law mandated that all public officials publicly declare their assets before taking office and upon leaving it – and the law was rigorously enforced. = Repression and controversy = Police chief embezzlement accusation On 18 September 1934, Efraín Aguilar Fuentes, Juventino Sánchez, Humberto Molina Santiago, Rafael Estrada Guilles, and Colonel Luis Ortiz Guzmán were tortured and executed inside the Guatemala National Penitenciary, accused of planning a plot to overthrow president Ubico. In his book The paradox garden (Spanish: '), written in 1935, Guatemalan writer Efraín De los Ríos accused the police chief, General Roderico Anzueto Valencia, of making up the plot to get rid of the accused conspirators. According to De los Ríos, this is what really happened: In early September 1934, when Ubico announced a popular referendum to determine whether he should extend his presidential term for another six years, the lawyer Efraín Aguilar Fuentes, the Property Registry director, sternly declined to be in favor of the president. When Ubico summoned him to the presidential office to chastise him, Fuentes coldly replied he was aware Police Chief Anzueto Valencia had embezzled up to twenty eight properties and therefore he, Aguilar, was not going to support the president. But he did not know that Anzueto was only the front man and the real owner was Ubico himself. In the following weeks, Anzueto Valencia made up a list of people involved in a false plot to murder Ubico Castañeda, and among the people in the list he included Aguilar Fuentes. All the people on the list were imprisoned, tortured and forced to confess. Their \\"confessions\\" appeared in the semi-official newspaper El Liberal Progresista. De los Ríos was incarcerated once the government learned about these strong accusations. He remained in the National Penitenciary for most of the rest of Ubico's presidency.  Congress gift  In 1940, the Guatemalan Congress gave Ubico a gift of US$200,000. Nearly 90 people were jailed for criticizing the gift. =Resignation and continuation= School teacher María Chinchilla Recinos in 1940. Ubico's repressive policies and arrogant demeanor led to a widespread popular insurrection led by middle-class intellectuals, professionals, and junior army officers. School teacher María Chinchilla Recinos' death during a peaceful demonstration on 25 June 1944 sparked an outcry that led to Ubico's resignation on 1 July 1944, amidst a general strike and nationwide protests. Initially, he had planned to hand over power to the former director of police, General Roderico Anzueto, who he felt could control. But his advisors recognized that Anzueto's pro-Nazi sympathies had made him very unpopular, and that he would not be able to control the military. Instead, Ubico chose to select a triumvirate composed of Major General Buenaventura Piñeda, Major General Eduardo Villagrán Ariza, and General Federico Ponce Vaides. The three generals promised to convene the national assembly to hold an election for a provisional president, but when congress met on 3 July, soldiers held everyone at gunpoint and forced them to vote for General Ponce, rather than the popular civilian candidate Ramón Calderón. Ponce, who had previously retired from military service due to alcoholism, took orders from Ubico and kept many of the officials who had worked in the Ubico administration. The repressive policies of the Ubico administration continued. =Revolution and overthrow= Opposition groups began organizing again, this time joined by many prominent political and military leaders who deemed the Ponce regime unconstitutional. Among the military officers in the opposition were Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán and Major Francisco Javier Arana. Ubico had fired Árbenz from his teaching post at the Escuela Politécnica (Politechnic School), and since then Árbenz had been in El Salvador organizing a band of revolutionary exiles. On 19 October 1944, a small group of soldiers and students led by Árbenz and Arana attacked the National Palace, in what later became known as the \\"October Revolution\\". Ponce was defeated and driven into exile. Árbenz, Arana, and a lawyer named Jorge Toriello established a junta which held democratic elections before the end of the year, and were won by a professor named Juan José Arévalo. Exile and death Ubico went into exile to New Orleans in the US and died of lung cancer on 14 June 1946.

Example radiating devices A computer is a typical example, where spurious emissions may not be contained within the case. A radio receiver will often use an intermediate frequency which is detectable outside the radio--the concept behind at least one audience measurement concept for roadside detection of radio stations which passing motorists are listening to. Other examples include the motor, transformer, dimmer, and corona from electrical powerlines. Unintentional radiation from these devices can create interference on AM radio, and on the video of television stations. Regulatory overview In North America, active devices that are characterized as \\"unintentional radiators\\" are governed by Part 15 of the FCC regulations. In Canada, Innovation, Science and Economic Development considers them as interference-causing Equipment. Globally, most domestic regulation of unintentional radiators are based on ITU recommendations. Generally, this means the device leaks a signal at some level. Microprocessor-controlled appliances, anything with a clock signal, and switching voltage regulators all make some kind of noise, at the repetition frequency and at harmonics. In most countries, government agencies regulate how much leakage is tolerated. This prevents leakage from cable television systems, for example, from interfering with radio communications between aircraft and control towers. Because it costs money to filter out noise, there is always a balance struck between regulatory compliance and perfect filtering in these devices. Microwave ovens or devices with microprocessors may leak within allowable limits but may generate an undesired signal that interferes with a licensed communications device. It also generally means that users who intentionally radiate signals (TV stations and cell phone companies) can order the device turned off if it interferes with their licensed operations. Ferrite bead at the end of a USB cable There is an entire industry based on regulatory compliance: manufacturers shipping a product to a foreign country must comply with each country's limitations on leakage of interfering signals. For example, in Germany the TÜV issues regulatory rules for unintentional radiators. The big cylindrical bumps on the cable to monitors and laptop chargers are ferrite cores which reduce undesired signals.

The station is student- and listener-supported, with diverse programming from a wide variety of genres. History Like many other college radio stations, WGHR originally began as a carrier current low-power AM station in 1969, transmitting on 1280 kHz from a wire loop antenna run atop the circle of buildings at the center of campus. Although not an officially assigned callsign, it took the name WSTB, an acronym for Southern Tech Broadcasting. Nicknamed \\"Stubby\\", its studio was in a dormitory. In the mid-1970s, the station applied for a low-power FM station. First trying 91.7, it was initially rejected for being too close to 91.9 (WCLK) and 91.1 (WREK). It then selected 102.5, and was eventually given a construction permit in 1979 for that frequency. Since there was already a WSTB FM in Streetsboro, Ohio, the students selected WGHR to mean \\" _G_ reen _H_ ornet _R_ adio\\", after the school's mascot. The nickname, likewise, became \\"Wooger\\" (later mocked by the station's own promos). After an extra year's delay due to a recalled Harris Broadcast transmitter, it finally began FM broadcasting in 1981, serving most of Cobb County in the northwest metro Atlanta area. At that time, it shared an office in the student center with The STING, the student newspaper. In 1993, the expansion and renovation of the building was completed, and it moved from the old office to its own studio. While the size of the building doubled, the size of the new station was actually cut in half, which was seen by many as a sign of how the station was viewed by the administration. However, it did include its own restroom (a definite necessity), and a large window into the atrium, right at the main entrance where students and visitors could see into the broadcast studio. This is still the station's current facility. Programming Not much is known about what the station sounded like back in the AM days. When it went to FM, the first song played was Barry Manilow's \\"Looks Like We Made It\\", and it continued playing top 40. It gradually went to a \\"college rock\\" format during the 1980s, and diversified during the early 1990s, which it has continued since. Early on, empty time slots were filled by going off the air, because the FCC at the time required a licensed human attendant at all times. When this requirement was later dropped, the station purchased a multi-cassette tape player, like might be used in a department store. It had four replaceable decks which alternated playing one after the other, and had no controls except for eject buttons. Because it already received so much wear and tear, the station still went off the air during the prolonged breaks between academic quarters. During the 1980s, the station would remain on air during morning/afternoon academic hours, going off air in the evening and weekends unless DJs were willing to volunteer. The station at the time was not a high priority among student activities and volunteer participation was often sparse. In the early 1990s the station was popular with students living in the dormitories of what was then called The Southern College of Technology as volunteer DJs could play music for parties in dorm rooms, having access to a large umber of CDs that were sent to the radio station by record companies. Phone calls from the party dorm room to the studio for requests were common, being broadcast live. This changed when the 1996 Summer Olympics came to town. After a DJ went to Canada and heard CBC Radio running the World Radio Network overnight instead of going off-air, the amateur radio club helped revive the satellite dish atop the building. The station then started broadcasting international news from WRN at night, on weekends, and during breaks. A simple broadcast automation system SPSU students put together now runs the station 24/7 when nobody is there. License WGHR's 17-watt ERP class D (low-power) FM signal was later forced from the air by a sequence of events related to FCC rulings, and the evolution of the commercial band in metro Atlanta. When WGHR first applied, FM class D stations were considered equal to other full-power stations. That changed in 1980, when the National Association of Broadcasters (representing only large commercial stations), the then-new National Public Radio, and even the Corporation for Public Broadcasting convinced the FCC to demote class D stations to a second-class status, and to stop issuing new class D licenses altogether. The exception was for NPR and NAB-member stations, who could continue building new broadcast translators (also class D) however they liked. While the discrimination against technically identical stations just for originating their own programming seems appalling and unconstitutional to many, these small stations have never had the resources to challenge this in court. Because of the ruling, WGHR (among many) was left completely vulnerable to any full-power station that wanted its spot on the dial. FCC docket 80-90, introduced in 1980, allowed full-power stations to move in or fill in closer together, forcing many class Ds off the air with no other place to go. In the Atlanta area, two new docket 80–90 allotments were proposed in the early 1980s, one north of Atlanta on 107.5, and one west-northwest on 102.5: WGHR's exact frequency. Five proposals were submitted to the FCC for the latter: one for Forest Park, one for Douglasville, one for Lithia Springs, one for Mableton, and finally WGHR's for Marietta, reserved as non-commercial educational (NCE). At the time, the FCC had no rules to level the playing field for NCE stations, so WGHR lost out. The remaining proposals floated around until 1988, when Mableton was selected, and the new allotment was opened for applications. Those applicants battled it out in court for years, until one was finally selected in the mid-1990s. The allotment of a new class A station at 102.5 MHz in Mableton prompted WGHR to move from that frequency to 100.7 MHz in 1998. When WWWQ (now WNNX) began broadcasting on 100.5 MHz in Atlanta, WGHR moved back to 102.5 temporarily to avoid receiving and causing interference, and an application was filed with the FCC to move to 101.1 MHz. Shortly afterward however, the full-power station WAMJ (now WPZE) began broadcasting, and WGHR was again forced to move. Because they were still licensed for 100.7 MHz, WGHR resumed broadcasting there. The owners of 100.5 (Susquehanna Radio Corporation) strongly objected to this, and consequently, WGHR ceased over-the-air broadcasts in order to avoid trouble with the FCC. In January 2004, after being unable to broadcast for 12 consecutive months, the FM license for WGHR was automatically canceled by the FCC as required by Congress, and the application to move to 101.1 was dismissed as moot.http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/MB/Public_Notices/Brdcst_Actions/ac040305.txt It continued to webcast, in hopes that the LPFM rules will later be relaxed, allowing it to return to the airwaves. Southern Polytechnic State University was merged into Kennesaw State University in 2013. WGHR was then dissolved in favor of Owl Radio, the online-only student radio station at KSU.

(Tarski originally called them \\"not strongly incompact\\" cardinals.) Formally, a cardinal κ is defined to be weakly compact if it is uncountable and for every function f: [κ] 2 → {0, 1} there is a set of cardinality κ that is homogeneous for f. In this context, [κ] 2 means the set of 2-element subsets of κ, and a subset S of κ is homogeneous for f if and only if either all of [S]2 maps to 0 or all of it maps to 1. The name \\"weakly compact\\" refers to the fact that if a cardinal is weakly compact then a certain related infinitary language satisfies a version of the compactness theorem; see below. Every weakly compact cardinal is a reflecting cardinal, and is also a limit of reflecting cardinals. This means also that weakly compact cardinals are Mahlo cardinals, and the set of Mahlo cardinals less than a given weakly compact cardinal is stationary.  Equivalent formulations  The following are equivalent for any uncountable cardinal κ: # κ is weakly compact. # for every λ<κ, natural number n ≥ 2, and function f: [κ]n → λ, there is a set of cardinality κ that is homogeneous for f. # κ is inaccessible and has the tree property, that is, every tree of height κ has either a level of size κ or a branch of size κ. # Every linear order of cardinality κ has an ascending or a descending sequence of order type κ. # κ is \\\\Pi^1_1-indescribable. # κ has the extension property. In other words, for all U ⊂ Vκ there exists a transitive set X with κ ∈ X, and a subset S ⊂ X, such that (Vκ, ∈, U) is an elementary substructure of (X, ∈, S). Here, U and S are regarded as unary predicates. # For every set S of cardinality κ of subsets of κ, there is a non-trivial κ-complete filter that decides S. # κ is κ-unfoldable. # κ is inaccessible and the infinitary language Lκ,κ satisfies the weak compactness theorem. # κ is inaccessible and the infinitary language Lκ,ω satisfies the weak compactness theorem. # κ is inaccessible and for every transitive set M of cardinality κ with κ \\\\in M, {}^{<\\\\kappa}M\\\\subset M, and satisfying a sufficiently large fragment of ZFC, there is an elementary embedding j from M to a transitive set N of cardinality κ such that ^{<\\\\kappa}N\\\\subset N, with critical point crit(j)=κ. A language Lκ,κ is said to satisfy the weak compactness theorem if whenever Σ is a set of sentences of cardinality at most κ and every subset with less than κ elements has a model, then Σ has a model. Strongly compact cardinals are defined in a similar way without the restriction on the cardinality of the set of sentences.

The number of components represents the minimum number of independent species necessary to define the composition of all phases of the system.Peter Atkins and Julio de Paula, \\"Physical Chemistry\\" 8th Edition (W.H. Freeman 2006), p.175-176 Calculating the number of components in a system is necessary when applying Gibbs' phase rule in determination of the number of degrees of freedom of a system. The number of components is equal to the number of distinct chemical species (constituents), minus the number of chemical reactions between them, minus the number of any constraints (like charge neutrality or balance of molar quantities). Calculation Suppose that a chemical system has elements and chemical species (elements or compounds). The latter are combinations of the former, and each species can be represented as a sum of elements: : A_i = \\\\sum_j a_{ij}E_j, where is the symbol for element and are the components of an matrix. Each species is determined by a vector (a row of this matrix), but the rows are not necessarily linearly independent. If the rank of the matrix is , then there are linearly independent vectors, and the remaining vectors can be obtained by adding up multiples of those vectors. The chemical species represented by those vectors are components of the system. If, for example, the species are C (in the form of graphite), CO2 and CO, then : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix}C \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\ O\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}C \\\\\\\\\\\\ CO_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ CO\\\\end{bmatrix}. Since CO can be expressed as CO = (1/2)C + (1/2)CO2, it is not independent and C and CO can be chosen as the components of the system. There are two ways that the vectors can be dependent. One is that some pairs of elements always appear in the same ratio in each species. An example is a series of polymers that are composed of different numbers of identical units. The number of such constraints is given by . In addition, some combinations of elements may be forbidden by chemical kinetics. If the number of such constraints is , then :C = M - Z + R'. Equivalently, if is the number of independent reactions that can take place, then :C = N - Z - R. The constants are related by . Examples =CaCO3 \\\\- CaO - CO2 system= This is an example of a system with several phases, which at ordinary temperatures are two solids and a gas. There are three chemical species (CaCO3, CaO and CO2) and one reaction: : CaCO3 CaO + CO2. The number of components is then 3 - 1 = 2. =Water - Hydrogen - Oxygen= The reactions included in the calculation are only those that actually occur under the given conditions, and not those that might occur under different conditions such as higher temperature or the presence of a catalyst. For example, the dissociation of water into its elements does not occur at ordinary temperature, so a system of water, hydrogen and oxygen at 25 °C has 3 independent components.

It was renamed the Southern Technical Institute in 1949 and moved to its present campus in Marietta, Georgia in 1962. It went through another name change in 1987 and became the Southern College of Technology. In the summer of 1996, the university adopted its polytechnic name. It was one among a small group of polytechnic universities in the United States that tend to be primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences. On November 1, 2013, plans were announced by the Georgia Board of Regents for Southern Polytechnic and Kennesaw State University to be consolidated into one university. On January 6, 2015, the Georgia Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia approved the consolidation of Southern Poly and Kennesaw State, with Kennesaw State as the surviving institution. On July 1, 2015, Kennesaw State established the Southern Polytechnic College of Engineering and Engineering Technology in honor of the former SPSU.  History  =Establishment= Globe After World War II, the need for technicians spiked due to a major economic shift in Georgia from being a largely agricultural state to one that is more industry heavy.The Macon Telegraph, 3 March 1948 The new industries required technicians to bridge the growing gap between engineers and craftsmen, effectively the gap between research/development and building/implementing. At the time, most technical institutes in the United States were in the northeastern states; thus the need for a technical institute in the south was great.W. L. Hughes, \\"A Brief Chronology of the Technical Institute Movement in America.\\" The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), 1947. In response to the growing demand, the president of the Georgia Institute of Technology, Colonel Blake R. Van Leer, sought to establish a technical institute program in Georgia. In 1945 he was approached by the Associated Industries of Georgia (AIG) who shared their common desire to have such a program and offered Van Leer their support. It took years for Van Leer to convince the Board of Regents to give Georgia Tech authorization to establish a technical institute. On October 8, 1947 the authorization was granted. The location chosen for the fledgling institute was a Naval Air Station in Chamblee, GA, which eventually became the site of DeKalb–Peachtree Airport. The first director was to be Professor Lawrence V. Johnson, and it was going to open under the name of The Technical Institute. On March 24, 1948 The Technical Institute held registration for the spring quarter and 116 students enrolled (all but 10 World War II veterans), including one young woman named Barbara Hudson. The institute had a staff of 12. =Progression= Southern Polytechnic State University's official university logo, 1996 to 2008 In 1949, The Technical Institute became the Southern Technical Institute and was recognized as a college-level school by the U.S. Department of Education. Twelve years later, the college migrated to its present campus in Marietta, Georgia, which was previously part of Dobbins Air Reserve Base. The General Lucius D. Clay National Guard Center (then known as Naval Air Station Atlanta) also moved to the opposite (south) end of Dobbins Air Reserve Base around the same time. In 1961, Hoyt McClure was named acting director and led the movement to build eight new buildings on of land. The Southern Technical Institute became accredited as a four-year college in 1970 and was one of the first colleges in the nation to offer the Bachelor of Engineering Technology degree. It also earned independence in the University System of Georgia, separating ties with Georgia Tech. In the summer of 1980, the college officially became the fourteenth senior college and the thirty-third independent unit of the University System of Georgia. The college's first president, Dr. Stephen R. Cheshier of Purdue University, was named in that same year. He saw the college through two name changes -- Southern College of Technology (often called Southern Tech) in 1987 and Southern Polytechnic State University in the summer of 1996, when the school became a university. Dr. Cheshier retired as president of the university in June 1997. Dr. Daniel S. Papp served as interim president from July 1997 to August 1998, when the university welcomed Dr. Lisa Rossbacher, formerly of Dickinson College, as its president. In 2005, Georgia Highlands College established a satellite campus hosted on the SPSU campus.Marietta Site  Georgia Highlands College.

Given that public comments are only allowed with fifteen days notice the Regents consolidation plans were perceived as a deceitful and secretive move by faculty and students. The presidents of the two universities were not told of the consolidation plans until \\"a week and a half\\" before the public announcement. Reasons given for the consolidation effort focused on cost savings despite the merger of eight other colleges into four only saving an estimated 0.1%. = Post-consolidation = Since the completion of the merger several scandals have plagued the newly augmented Kennesaw State. Less than two years after the consolidation President Dan Papp announced that he was stepping down as president of the university. His replacement, Sam Olens, was appointed amidst controversy over his total lack of education experience or background. This appointment came on the heels of an audit that revealed that outgoing president Papp had violated financial policy in receiving more than a half million dollars in early retirement payment. Before Papp's retirement announcement a seven-figure embezzlement scheme was uncovered and five KSU staffers and contractors were arrested. The amount lost equated to nearly 15% of the merger-based savings of 2013. Campus ;Student housing :Dormitory facilities were provided at Southern Tech's first location in Chamblee, Georgia. They were created from former bachelor officers' quarters in facilities leased from the Atlanta Naval Air Station. When the campus moved in Marietta, housing was provided in residences originally built to house employees at the Bell Bomber plant (now the Lockheed Martin facility). The facilities were at that time being managed by the Marietta Housing Authority as low-income residences and were known as \\"Marietta Place.\\" Construction for the Marietta campus' first dormitory began in 1964.

When the tub became difficult to move they attached wheels to it. Some time after, other fraternities acquired their own cast-iron tubs, attached wheels, and the fraternities began to hold races around the perimeter of the school. In light of a growing liability risk the school ended the annual tub races in the early 1990s. In 2010 the SPSU alumni group resurrected the Bathtub Race, under the stipulation that the tubs be motorless. =Athletics= Southern Poly was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and competed in the Southern States Athletic Conference (SSAC). Men's sports included baseball, basketball and soccer; while women's sports include basketball. The university's athletic teams were known as the Runnin' Hornets, although \\"Runnin' Hornets\\" is often shortened to \\"Hornets\\" in use. The university's mascot was Sting, a green and black, anthropomorphic hornet bearing the stylized version of the university's logo on its chest.\\"Members\\". Southern States Athletic Conference.

Al- Kindi was the first of the Islamic peripatetic philosophers, and is hailed as the \\"father of Arab philosophy\\". Al-Kindi was born in Kufa and educated in Baghdad. He became a prominent figure in the House of Wisdom, and a number of Abbasid Caliphs appointed him to oversee the translation of Greek scientific and philosophical texts into the Arabic language. This contact with \\"the philosophy of the ancients\\" (as Hellenistic philosophy was often referred to by Muslim scholars) had a profound effect on him, as he synthesized, adapted and promoted Hellenistic and Peripatetic philosophy in the Muslim world. He subsequently wrote hundreds of original treatises of his own on a range of subjects ranging from metaphysics, ethics, logic and psychology, to medicine, pharmacology, mathematics, astronomy, astrology and optics, and further afield to more practical topics like perfumes, swords, jewels, glass, dyes, zoology, tides, mirrors, meteorology and earthquakes. In the field of mathematics, al- Kindi played an important role in introducing Indian numerals to the Islamic world, and subsequently, relabeled as Arabic numerals, to the Christian world, along with Al-Khwarizmi. Al-Kindi was also one of the fathers of cryptography. Building on the work of Al-Khalil (717–786), Al-Kindi's book entitled Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages gave rise to the birth of cryptanalysis, was the earliest known use of statistical inference, and introduced several new methods of breaking ciphers, notably frequency analysis. Using his mathematical and medical expertise, he was able to develop a scale that would allow doctors to quantify the potency of their medication. The central theme underpinning al-Kindi's philosophical writings is the compatibility between philosophy and other \\"orthodox\\" Islamic sciences, particularly theology. And many of his works deal with subjects that theology had an immediate interest in. These include the nature of God, the soul and prophetic knowledge. But despite the important role he played in making philosophy accessible to Muslim intellectuals, his own philosophical output was largely overshadowed by that of al-Farabi and very few of his texts are available for modern scholars to examine. Early life Al-Kindi was born in Kufa to an aristocratic family of the Kinda tribe, descended from the chieftain al-Ash'ath ibn Qays, a contemporary of Prophet Muhammad The family belonged to the most prominent families of the tribal nobility of Kufa in the early Islamic period, until it lost much of its power following the revolt of Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath. His father Ishaq was the governor of Kufa, and al-Kindi received his preliminary education there. He later went to complete his studies in Baghdad, where he was patronized by the Abbasid caliphs al-Ma'mun (ruled 813–833) and al-Mu'tasim (r. 833–842). On account of his learning and aptitude for study, al-Ma'mun appointed him to the House of Wisdom, a recently established centre for the translation of Greek philosophical and scientific texts, in Baghdad. He was also well known for his beautiful calligraphy, and at one point was employed as a calligrapher by al- Mutawakkil. When al-Ma'mun died, his brother, al-Mu'tasim became Caliph. Al- Kindi's position would be enhanced under al-Mu'tasim, who appointed him as a tutor to his son. But on the accession of al-Wāthiq (r. 842–847), and especially of al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861), al-Kindi's star waned. There are various theories concerning this: some attribute al-Kindi's downfall to scholarly rivalries at the House of Wisdom; others refer to al-Mutawakkil's often violent persecution of unorthodox Muslims (as well as of non-Muslims); at one point al-Kindi was beaten and his library temporarily confiscated. Henry Corbin, an authority on Islamic studies, says that in 873, al-Kindi died \\"a lonely man\\", in Baghdad during the reign of al-Mu'tamid (r. 870–892). After his death, al-Kindi's philosophical works quickly fell into obscurity and many of them were lost even to later Islamic scholars and historians. Felix Klein- Franke suggests a number of reasons for this: aside from the militant orthodoxy of al-Mutawakkil, the Mongols also destroyed countless libraries during their invasion. However, he says the most probable cause of this was that his writings never found popularity amongst subsequent influential philosophers such as al-Farabi and Avicenna, who ultimately overshadowed him. His philosophical career peaked under al-Mu‘tasim, to whom al-Kindi dedicated his most famous work, On First Philosophy, and whose son Ahmad was tutored by al-Kindi. Accomplishments According to Ibn al-Nadim, al-Kindi wrote at least two hundred and sixty books, contributing heavily to geometry (thirty- two books), medicine and philosophy (twenty-two books each), logic (nine books), and physics (twelve books). Although most of his books have been lost over the centuries, a few have survived in the form of Latin translations by Gerard of Cremona, and others have been rediscovered in Arabic manuscripts; most importantly, twenty-four of his lost works were located in the mid- twentieth century in a Turkish library. =Philosophy= His greatest contribution to the development of Islamic philosophy was his efforts to make Greek thought both accessible and acceptable to a Muslim audience. Al-Kindi carried out this mission from the House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikma), an institute of translation and learning patronized by the Abbasid Caliphs, in Baghdad. As well as translating many important texts, much of what was to become standard Arabic philosophical vocabulary originated with al-Kindi; indeed, if it had not been for him, the work of philosophers like Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and al-Ghazali might not have been possible. In his writings, one of al-Kindi's central concerns was to demonstrate the compatibility between philosophy and natural theology on the one hand, and revealed or speculative theology on the other (though in fact he rejected speculative theology). Despite this, he did make clear that he believed revelation was a superior source of knowledge to reason because it guaranteed matters of faith that reason could not uncover. And while his philosophical approach was not always original, and was even considered clumsy by later thinkers (mainly because he was the first philosopher writing in the Arabic language), he successfully incorporated Aristotelian and (especially) neo-Platonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world. =Astronomy= Al-Kindi took his view of the solar system from Ptolemy, who placed the Earth at the centre of a series of concentric spheres, in which the known heavenly bodies (the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and the stars) are embedded. In one of his treatises on the subject, he says that these bodies are rational entities, whose circular motion is in obedience to and worship of God. Their role, al-Kindi believes, is to act as instruments for divine providence. He furnishes empirical evidence as proof for this assertion; different seasons are marked by particular arrangements of the planets and stars (most notably the sun); the appearance and manner of people varies according to the arrangement of heavenly bodies situated above their homeland. However, he is ambiguous when it comes to the actual process by which the heavenly bodies affect the material world. One theory he posits in his works is from Aristotle, who conceived that the movement of these bodies causes friction in the sub-lunar region, which stirs up the primary elements of earth, fire, air and water, and these combine to produce everything in the material world. An alternative view found his treatise On Rays is that the planets exercise their influence in straight lines. In each of these, he presents two fundamentally different views of physical interaction; action by contact and action at a distance. This dichotomy is duplicated in his writings on optics. Some of the notable astrological works by al-Kindi include: *The Book of the Judgement of the Stars, including The Forty Chapters, on questions and elections. *On the Stellar Rays. *Several epistles on weather and meteorology, including De mutatione temporum, (\\"On the Changing of the Weather\\"). *Treatise on the Judgement of Eclipses. *Treatise on the Dominion of the Arabs and its Duration (used to predict the end of Arab rule). *The Choices of Days (on elections). *On the Revolutions of the Years (on mundane astrology and natal revolutions). *De Signis Astronomiae Applicitis as Mediciam 'On the Signs of Astronomy as applied to Medicine' *Treatise on the Spirituality of the Planets. =Optics= De radiis, manuscript, 17th century. Cambridge, Trinity College Library, Medieval manuscripts, MS R.15.17 (937). Al-Kindi was the first major writer on optics since antiquity. Roger Bacon placed him in the first rank after Ptolemy as a writer on the topic. In a work known in the west as De radiis stellarum, al- Kindi developed a theory \\"that everything in the world ... emits rays in every direction, which fill the whole world.\\" This theory of the active power of rays had an influence on later scholars such as Ibn al-Haytham, Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon. Two major theories of optics appear in the writings of al-Kindi; Aristotelian and Euclidean. Aristotle had believed that in order for the eye to perceive an object, both the eye and the object must be in contact with a transparent medium (such as air) that is filled with light. When these criteria are met, the \\"sensible form\\" of the object is transmitted through the medium to the eye. On the other hand, Euclid proposed that vision occurred in straight lines when \\"rays\\" from the eye reached an illuminated object and were reflected back. As with his theories on Astrology, the dichotomy of contact and distance is present in al-Kindi's writings on this subject as well. The factor which al-Kindi relied upon to determine which of these theories was most correct was how adequately each one explained the experience of seeing. For example, Aristotle's theory was unable to account for why the angle at which an individual sees an object affects his perception of it. For example, why a circle viewed from the side will appear as a line. According to Aristotle, the complete sensible form of a circle should be transmitted to the eye and it should appear as a circle. On the other hand, Euclidean optics provided a geometric model that was able to account for this, as well as the length of shadows and reflections in mirrors, because Euclid believed that the visual \\"rays\\" could only travel in straight lines (something which is commonly accepted in modern science). For this reason, al-Kindi considered the latter preponderant. Al-Kindi's primary optical treatise \\"De aspectibus\\" was later translated into Latin. This work, along with Alhazen's Optics and the Arabic translations of Ptolemy and Euclid's Optics, were the main Arabic texts to affect the development of optical investigations in Europe, most notably those of Robert Grosseteste, Vitello and Roger Bacon. =Medicine= There are more than thirty treatises attributed to al-Kindi in the field of medicine, in which he was chiefly influenced by the ideas of Galen. His most important work in this field is probably De Gradibus, in which he demonstrates the application of mathematics to medicine, particularly in the field of pharmacology. For example, he developed a mathematical scale to quantify the strength of drug and a system, based the phases of the moon, that would allow a doctor to determine in advance the most critical days of a patient's illness. According to Plinio Prioreschi, this was the first attempt at serious quantification in medicine. =Chemistry= As an advanced chemist, Al-Kindi was also an opponent of alchemy; he debunked the myth that simple, base metals could be transformed into precious metals such as gold or silver. Al-Kindi unambiguously described the distillation of wine. In a book titled as Kitab al-Taraffuq fi al-'itr (The Book of the chemistry of Perfume and distillations), he says, after describing the method and apparatus needed for distillation: \\"In this way one can distill wine using a water-bath, and it comes out the same color as rose-water\\". Also in the same book, he describes the distillation process for extracting rose oils, and provides the recipes for 107 different kinds of perfumes. =Mathematics= Al-Kindi authored works on a number of important mathematical subjects, including arithmetic, geometry, the Indian numbers, the harmony of numbers, lines and multiplication with numbers, relative quantities, measuring proportion and time, and numerical procedures and cancellation. He also wrote four volumes, On the Use of the Indian Numerals ( Kitāb fī Isti\`māl al-'A\`dād al-Hindīyyah) which contributed greatly to diffusion of the Indian system of numeration in the Middle-East and the West. In geometry, among other works, he wrote on the theory of parallels. Also related to geometry were two works on optics. One of the ways in which he made use of mathematics as a philosopher was to attempt to disprove the eternity of the world by demonstrating that actual infinity is a mathematical and logical absurdity. =Cryptography= The first page of al- Kindi's manuscript \\"On Deciphering Cryptographic Messages\\", containing the oldest known description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis. Al-Kindi is credited with developing a method whereby variations in the frequency of the occurrence of letters could be analyzed and exploited to break ciphers (i.e. cryptanalysis by frequency analysis). His book on this topic is Risāla fī Istikhrāj al-Kutub al-Mu'ammāh (رسالة في استخراج الكتب المعماة; literally: On Extracting Obscured Correspondence, more contemporarily: On Decrypting Encrypted Correspondence). In his treatise on cryptanalysis, he wrote: > One way to solve an encrypted message, if we know its language, is to find a > different plaintext of the same language long enough to fill one sheet or > so, and then we count the occurrences of each letter. We call the most > frequently occurring letter the \\"first\\", the next most occurring letter the > \\"second\\", the following most occurring letter the \\"third\\", and so on, until > we account for all the different letters in the plaintext sample. Then we > look at the cipher text we want to solve and we also classify its symbols. > We find the most occurring symbol and change it to the form of the \\"first\\" > letter of the plaintext sample, the next most common symbol is changed to > the form of the \\"second\\" letter, and the following most common symbol is > changed to the form of the \\"third\\" letter, and so on, until we account for > all symbols of the cryptogram we want to solve. Al-Kindi was influenced by the work of Al-Khalil (717–786), who wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages, which contains the first use of permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels. =Meteorology= In a treatise entitled as Risala fi l-Illa al-Failali l-Madd wa l-Fazr (Treatise on the Efficient Cause of the Flow and Ebb), Al-Kindi presents a theory on tides which \\"depends on the changes which take place in bodies owing to the rise and fall of temperature.\\" In order to support his argument, he gave a description of a scientific experiment as follows: > One can also observe by the senses... how in consequence of extreme cold air > changes into water. To do this, one takes a glass bottle, fills it > completely with snow, and closes its end carefully. Then one determines its > weight by weighing. One places it in a container... which has previously > been weighed. On the surface of the bottle the air changes into water, and > appears upon it like the drops on large porous pitchers, so that a > considerable amount of water gradually collects inside the container. One > then weighs the bottle, the water and the container, and finds their weight > greater than previously, which proves the change. [...] Some foolish persons > are of opinion that the snow exudes through the glass. This is impossible. > There is no process by which water or snow can be made to pass through > glass. In explaining the natural cause of the wind, and the difference for its directions based on time and location, he wrote: > When the sun is in its northern declination northerly places will heat up > and it will be cold towards the south. Then the northern air will expand in > a southerly direction because of the heat due to the contraction of the > southern air. Therefore most of the summer winds are merits and most of the > winter winds are not. =Music theory= Al-Kindi was the first great theoretician of music in the Arab-Islamic world. He is known to have written fifteen treatises on music theory, but only five have survived. He added a fifth string to the 'ud. His works included discussions on the therapeutic value of music and what he regarded as \\"cosmological connections\\" of music. Philosophical thought =Influences= While Muslim intellectuals were already acquainted with Greek philosophy (especially logic), al-Kindi is credited with being the first real Muslim philosopher. His own thought was largely influenced by the Neo-Platonic philosophy of Proclus, Plotinus and John Philoponus, amongst others, although he does appear to have borrowed ideas from other Hellenistic schools as well. He makes many references to Aristotle in his writings, but these are often unwittingly re-interpreted in a Neo-Platonic framework. This trend is most obvious in areas such as metaphysics and the nature of God as a causal entity. Earlier experts had suggested that he was influenced by the Mutazilite school of theology, because of the mutual concern both he and they demonstrated for maintaining the singularity (tawhid) of God. However, such agreements are now considered incidental, as further study has shown that they disagreed on a number of equally important topics. =Metaphysics= According to al-Kindi, the goal of metaphysics is knowledge of God. For this reason, he does not make a clear distinction between philosophy and theology, because he believes they are both concerned with the same subject. Later philosophers, particularly al- Farabi and Avicenna, would strongly disagree with him on this issue, by saying that metaphysics is actually concerned with being qua being, and as such, the nature of God is purely incidental. Central to al-Kindi's understanding of metaphysics is God's absolute oneness, which he considers an attribute uniquely associated with God (and therefore not shared with anything else). By this he means that while we may think of any existent thing as being \\"one\\", it is in fact both \\"one\\" and many\\". For example, he says that while a body is one, it is also composed of many different parts. A person might say \\"I see an elephant\\", by which he means \\"I see one elephant\\", but the term 'elephant' refers to a species of animal that contains many. Therefore, only God is absolutely one, both in being and in concept, lacking any multiplicity whatsoever. Some feel this understanding entails a very rigorous negative theology because it implies that any description which can be predicated to anything else, cannot be said about God. In addition to absolute oneness, al- Kindi also described God as the Creator. This means that He acts as both a final and efficient cause. Unlike later Muslim Neo-Platonic philosophers (who asserted that the universe existed as a result of God's existence \\"overflowing\\", which is a passive act), al-Kindi conceived of God as an active agent. In fact, of God as the agent, because all other intermediary agencies are contingent upon Him. The key idea here is that God \\"acts\\" through created intermediaries, which in turn \\"act\\" on one another – through a chain of cause and effect – to produce the desired result. In reality, these intermediary agents do not \\"act\\" at all, they are merely a conduit for God's own action. This is especially significant in the development of Islamic philosophy, as it portrayed the \\"first cause\\" and \\"unmoved mover\\" of Aristotelian philosophy as compatible with the concept of God according to Islamic revelation. =Epistemology= Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle were highly respected in the medieval Islamic world. Al-Kindi theorized that there was a separate, incorporeal and universal intellect (known as the \\"First Intellect\\"). It was the first of God's creation and the intermediary through which all other things came into creation. Aside from its obvious metaphysical importance, it was also crucial to al-Kindi's epistemology, which was influenced by Platonic realism. According to Plato, everything that exists in the material world corresponds to certain universal forms in the heavenly realm. These forms are really abstract concepts such as a species, quality or relation, which apply to all physical objects and beings. For example, a red apple has the quality of \\"redness\\" derived from the appropriate universal. However, al-Kindi says that human intellects are only potentially able to comprehend these. This potential is actualized by the First Intellect, which is perpetually thinking about all of the universals. He argues that the external agency of this intellect is necessary by saying that human beings cannot arrive at a universal concept merely through perception. In other words, an intellect cannot understand the species of a thing simply by examining one or more of its instances. According to him, this will only yield an inferior \\"sensible form\\", and not the universal form which we desire. The universal form can only be attained through contemplation and actualization by the First Intellect. The analogy he provides to explain his theory is that of wood and fire. Wood, he argues, is potentially hot (just as a human is potentially thinking about a universal), and therefore requires something else which is already hot (such as fire) to actualize this. This means that for the human intellect to think about something, the First Intellect must already be thinking about it. Therefore, he says that the First Intellect must always be thinking about everything. Once the human intellect comprehends a universal by this process, it becomes part of the individual's \\"acquired intellect\\" and can be thought about whenever he or she wishes. =The soul and the afterlife= Al-Kindi says that the soul is a simple, immaterial substance, which is related to the material world only because of its faculties which operate through the physical body. To explain the nature of our worldly existence, he (borrowing from Epictetus) compares it to a ship which has, during the course of its ocean voyage, temporarily anchored itself at an island and allowed its passengers to disembark. The implicit warning is that those passengers who linger too long on the island may be left behind when the ship sets sail again. Here, al-Kindi displays a stoic concept, that we must not become attached to material things (represented by the island), as they will invariably be taken away from us (when the ship sets sail again). He then connects this with a Neo-Platonist idea, by saying that our soul can be directed towards the pursuit of desire or the pursuit of intellect; the former will tie it to the body, so that when the body dies, it will also die, but the latter will free it from the body and allow it to survive \\"in the light of the Creator\\" in a realm of pure intelligence. =The relationship between revelation and philosophy= In the view of al-Kindi, prophecy and philosophy were two different routes to arrive at the truth. He contrasts the two positions in four ways. Firstly, while a person must undergo a long period of training and study to become a philosopher, prophecy is bestowed upon someone by God. Secondly, the philosopher must arrive at the truth by his own devices (and with great difficulty), whereas the prophet has the truth revealed to him by God. Thirdly, the understanding of the prophet – being divinely revealed – is clearer and more comprehensive than that of the philosopher. Fourthly, the way in which the prophet is able to express this understanding to the ordinary people is superior. Therefore, al-Kindi says the prophet is superior in two fields: the ease and certainty with which he receives the truth, and the way in which he presents it. However, the crucial implication is that the content of the prophet's and the philosopher's knowledge is the same. This, says Adamson, demonstrates how limited the superiority al-Kindi afforded to prophecy was. In addition to this, al-Kindi adopted a naturalistic view of prophetic visions. He argued that, through the faculty of \\"imagination\\" as conceived of in Aristotelian philosophy, certain \\"pure\\" and well-prepared souls, were able to receive information about future events. Significantly, he does not attribute such visions or dreams to revelation from God, but instead explains that imagination enables human beings to receive the \\"form\\" of something without needing to perceive the physical entity to which it refers. Therefore, it would seem to imply that anyone who has purified themselves would be able to receive such visions. It is precisely this idea, amongst other naturalistic explanations of prophetic miracles that al-Ghazali attacks in his Incoherence of the Philosophers. =Critics and patrons= While al- Kindi appreciated the usefulness of philosophy in answering questions of a religious nature, there would be many Islamic thinkers who were not as enthusiastic about its potential. But it would be incorrect to assume that they opposed philosophy simply because it was a \\"foreign science\\". Oliver Leaman, an expert on Islamic philosophy, points out that the objections of notable theologians are rarely directed at philosophy itself, but rather at the conclusions the philosophers arrived at. Even al-Ghazali, who is famous for his critique of the philosophers, was himself an expert in philosophy and logic. And his criticism was that they arrived at theologically erroneous conclusions. The three most serious of these, in his view, were believing in the co-eternity of the universe with God, denying the bodily resurrection, and asserting that God only has knowledge of abstract universals, not of particular things (not all philosophers subscribed to these same views). During his life, al-Kindi was fortunate enough to enjoy the patronage of the pro-Mutazilite Caliphs al-Ma'mun and al-Mu'tasim, which meant he could carry out his philosophical speculations with relative ease. In his own time, al- Kindi would be criticized for extolling the \\"intellect\\" as being the most immanent creation in proximity to God, which was commonly held to be the position of the angels.Black, p168 He also engaged in disputations with the Mutazilites, whom he attacked for their belief in atoms.Black, p169 But the real role of al-Kindi in the conflict between philosophers and theologians would be to prepare the ground for debate. His works, says Deborah Black, contained all the seeds of future controversy that would be fully realized in al-Ghazali's Incoherence of the Philosophers.Black, p171 Legacy Al-Kindi was a master of many different areas of thought and was held to be one of the greatest Islamic philosophers of his time. His influence in the fields of physics, mathematics, medicine, philosophy and music were far-reaching and lasted for several centuries. Ibn al-Nadim in his al-Fihrist praised Al-Kindi and his work stating: > The best man of his time, unique in his knowledge of all the ancient > sciences. He is called the Philosopher of the Arabs. His books deal with > different sciences, such as logic, philosophy, geometry, arithmetic, > astronomy etc. We have connected him with the natural philosophers because > of his prominence in Science. Al-Kindi major contribution was his establishment of philosophy in the Islamic world and his efforts in trying to harmonize the philosophical investigation along with the Islamic theology and creed. The philosophical texts which were translated under his supervision would become the standard texts in the Islamic world for centuries to come, even after his influence has been eclipsed by later Philosophers. Al-Kindi was also an important figure in medieval Europe. Several of his books got translated into Latin influencing western authors like Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon. The Italian Renaissance scholar Geralomo Cardano (1501–1575) considered him as one of the twelve greatest minds.

Human survival in bushland has a whole mythology evolving around it, with the legendary stories of Aboriginal trackers and bushrangers deeply entrenched in Australian folklore. Bushland has been a traditional source of wood for fuel and bushfood. Bushland provides a number of ecosystem services including the protection of water quality, stopping erosion, acting as a windbreak, and trapping nutrients. Bushland is prone to bushfires. This presents a challenge to authorities as infrastructure and habitations encroach into bushland areas. Preservation Until recently Australia had a very high rate of land clearing which resulted in the destruction of bushland. Since 2006 the rate of land clearing has declined significantly. This is partially attributed to legislation which placed a ban on broadscale clearing of mature bushland in Queensland in 2006 and an expansion of those bans to regrowing bushland with a high conservation value in 2009. In New South Wales bushfires cause the greatest destruction of bushland, followed by land clearing for crops, grazing, road and buildings. Bushland preservation has become the focus of some conservation efforts. In Brisbane, the Brisbane City Council has established a Bushland Acquisition Program which is funded by a small levy paid by rate-payers. The program began in 1990 and aims to protect koala habitat from urban development. It is estimate that the koala population in the area has declined from 6,240 in 1996 to 1,500 in 2012.

Yossef Rapoport and Shahab Ahmed (Karachi: Oxford University Press, 2010), 6 Ibn Taymiyyah has become one of the most influential medieval writers in contemporary Islam, where his particular interpretations of the Qur'an and the Sunnah and his rejection of some aspects of classical Islamic tradition are believed to have had considerable influence on contemporary ultra-conservative ideologies such as Wahhabism, Salafism, and Jihadism. Particular aspects of his teachings had a profound influence on Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of the Hanbali reform movement practiced in Saudi Arabia, and on other later Wahabi scholars. Moreover, Ibn Taymiyyah's controversial fatwa allowing jihad against other Muslims is referenced by al-Qaeda and other jihadi groups. Their reading of Ibn Taymiyyah's thought has been challenged by recent scholarship.  Name  Ibn Taymiyyah's full name is Ahmad ibn \`Abd al-Ḥalīm ibn \`Abd as-Salām ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Khidr ibn Muhammad ibn al-Khidr ibn Ibrahim ibn \`Ali ibn ʿAbd Allāh al-Numayri al-Ḥarrānī (). Ibn Taymiyyah's () name is unusual in that it is derived from a female member of his family as opposed to a male member, which was the normal custom at the time and still is now. Taymiyyah was a prominent woman, famous for her scholarship and piety and the name Ibn Taymiyyah was taken up by many of her male descendants.  Overview  Ibn Taymiyyah had a simple life, most of which he dedicated to learning, writing, and teaching. He never married nor did he have a female companion, throughout his years. Al-Matroudi says that this may be why he was able to engage fully with the political affairs of his time without holding any official position such as that of a judge. An offer of an official position was made to him but he never accepted. His life was that of a religious scholar and a political activist. In his efforts he was persecuted and imprisoned on six occasions with the total time spent inside prison coming to over six years. Other sources say that he spent over twelve years in prison. His detentions were due to certain elements of his creed and his views on some jurisprudential issues. However according to Yahya Michot, \\"the real reasons were more trivial\\". Michot gives five reasons as to why Ibn Taymiyyah was imprisoned, they being: not complying with the \\"doctrines and practices prevalent among powerful religious and Sufi establishments, an overly outspoken personality, the jealousy of his peers, the risk to public order due to this popular appeal and political intrigues.\\" Baber Johansen, a professor at the Harvard Divinity School, says that the reasons for Ibn Taymiyyah's incarcerations were, \\"as a result of his conflicts with Muslim mystics, jurists, and theologians, who were able to persuade the political authorities of the necessity to limit Ibn Taymiyyah's range of action through political censorship and incarceration.\\" Ibn Taymiyyah's own relationship, as a religious scholar, with the ruling apparatus was not always amicable. It ranged from silence to open rebellion. On occasions when he shared the same views and aims as the ruling authorities, his contributions were welcomed but when Ibn Taymiyyah went against the status quo, he was seen as \\"uncooperative\\" and on occasions spent much time in prison. Ibn Taymiyyah's attitude towards his own rulers, was based on the actions of Muhammad's companions when they made an oath of allegiance to him as follows; \\"to obey within obedience to God, even if the one giving the order is unjust; to abstain from disputing the authority of those who exert it; and to speak out the truth, or take up its cause without fear in respect of God, of blame from anyone.\\"  Early years  = Background = His father had the Hanbali chair in Harran and later at the Umayyad Mosque. Harran was a city part of the Sultanate of Rum, now Harran is a small city on the border of Syria and Turkey, currently in Şanlıurfa province. At the beginning of the Islamic period, Harran was located in the land of the Mudar tribe (Diyar Mudar). Before its destruction by the Mongols, Harran was also well known since the early days of Islam for its Hanbali school and tradition, to which Ibn Taymiyyah's family belonged. His grandfather, Abu al-Barkat Majd ad-Din ibn Taymiyyah al-Hanbali (d. 1255) and his uncle, Fakhr al-Din (d. 1225) were reputable scholars of the Hanbali school of law. Likewise, the scholarly achievements of his father, Shihab al-Din Abd al-Halim ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1284) were also well known. = Immigration to Damascus = In 1269, aged seven, Ibn Taymiyyah, left Harran together with his father and three brothers. The city was completely destroyed by the ensuing Mongol invasion. Ibn Taymiyyah's family moved and settled in Damascus, Syria, which at the time was ruled by the Mamluk Sultanate. = Education = In Damascus, his father served as the director of the Sukkariyya Madrasa, a place where Ibn Taymiyyah also received his early education. Ibn Taymiyyah acquainted himself with the religious and secular sciences of his time. His religious studies began in his early teens, when he committed the entire Qur'an to memory and later on came to learn the Islamic disciplines of the Qur'an. From his father he learnt the religious science of fiqh (jurisprudence) and usul al-fiqh (principles of jurisprudence). Ibn Taymiyyah learnt the works of Ahmad ibn Hanbal, al- Khallal, Ibn Qudamah and also the works of his grandfather, Abu al-Barakat Majd ad-Din. His study of jurisprudence was not limited to the Hanbali tradition but he also learnt the other schools of jurisprudence. The number of scholars under which he studied hadith is said to number more than two hundred, four of whom were women. Those who are known by name amount to forty hadith teachers, as recorded by Ibn Taymiyyah in his book called Arba\`un Hadithan. Serajul Haque says, based on this, Ibn Taymiyyah started to hear hadith from the age of five. One of his teachers was the first Hanbali Chief Justice of Syria, Shams ud-Din Al-Maqdisi who held the newly created position instituted by Baibars as part of a reform of the judiciary. Al-Maqdisi later on, came to give Ibn Taymiyyah permission to issue Fatawa (legal verdicts) when he became a mufti at the age of 17. Ibn Taymiyyah's secular studies led him to devote attention to Arabic language and Arabic literature by studying Arabic grammar and lexicography under Ali ibn \`Abd al-Qawi al-Tuft. He went on to master the famous book of Arabic grammar, Al-Kitab, by the Persian grammarian Sibawayhi. He also studied mathematics, algebra, calligraphy, theology (kalam), philosophy, history and heresiography.see aqidatul- waasitiyyah daarussalaam publications The knowledge he gained from history and philosophy, he used to refute the prevalent philosophical discourses of his time, one of which was Aristotelian philosophy. Ibn Taymiyyah learnt about Sufism and stated that he had reflected on the works of; Sahl al-Tustari, Junayd of Baghdad, Abu Talib al-Makki, Abdul-Qadir Gilani, Abu Hafs Umar al- Suhrawardi and Ibn Arabi. At the age of 20 in the year 1282, Ibn Taymiyyah completed his education.  Life as a scholar  Umayyad Mosque, a place where Ibn Taimiyya used to give lessons. After his father died in 1284, he took up the then vacant post as the head of the Sukkariyya madrasa and began giving lessons on Hadith. A year later he started giving lessons, as chair of the Hanbali Zawiya on Fridays at the Umayyad Mosque, on the subject of tafsir (exegesis of Qur'an). In November 1292, Ibn Taymiyyah performed the Hajj and after returning 4 months later, he wrote his first book aged twenty nine called Manasik al-Hajj (Rites of the Pilgrimage), in which he criticized and condemned the religious innovations he saw take place there. Ibn Taymiyyah represented the Hanbali school of thought during this time. The Hanbali school was seen as the most traditional school out of the four legal systems (Hanafi, Maliki and Shafii) because it was \\"suspicious of the Hellenist disciplines of philosophy and speculative theology.\\" He remained faithful throughout his life to this school, whose doctrines he had mastered, but he nevertheless called for ijtihad (independent reasoning by one who is qualified) and discouraged taqlid. = Relationship with authorities = Ibn Taymiyyah's emergence into the public and political sphere began in 1293 at the age of 30, when he was asked by the authorities to issue a fatwa (legal verdict) on Assaf al-Nasrani, a Christian cleric accused of insulting Muhammad. He accepted the invitation and delivered his fatwa, calling for the man to receive the death penalty. Despite the fact that public opinion was very much on Ibn Taymiyyah's side, the Governor of Syria attempted to resolve the situation by asking Assaf to accept Islam in return for his life, to which he agreed. This resolution was not acceptable to Ibn Taymiyyah who then, together with his followers, protested outside the governor's palace demanding Assaf be put to death, on the grounds that any person—Muslim or non-Muslim—who insults Muhammad must be killed. This unwillingness to compromise coupled with his attempt to protest against the governor's actions, resulted in him being punished with a prison sentence, the first of many such imprisonments to come. The French orientalist Henri Laoust says that during this incarceration Ibn Taymiyyah \\"wrote his first great work, al-Ṣārim al-maslūl ʿalā s̲h̲ātim al-Rasūl (The Drawn Sword against those who insult the Messenger).\\" Ibn Taymiyyah, together with the help of his disciples, continued with his efforts against what, \\"he perceived to be un-Islamic practices\\" and to implement what he saw as his religious duty of commanding good and forbidding wrong. Yahya Michot says that some of these incidences included: \\"shaving children's heads\\", leading \\"an anti-debauchery campaign in brothels and taverns\\", hitting an atheist before his public execution, destroying what was thought to be a sacred rock in a mosque, attacking astrologers and obliging \\"deviant Sufi Shaykhs to make public acts of contrition and to adhere to the Sunnah.\\" Ibn Taymiyyah and his disciples used to condemn wine sellers and they would attack wine shops in Damascus by breaking wine bottles and pouring them onto the floor. A few years later in 1296, he took over the position of one of his teachers (Zayn al-Din Ibn al- Munadjdjaal), taking the post of professor of Hanbali jurisprudence at the Hanbaliyya madrasa, the oldest such institution of this tradition in Damascus. This is seen by some to be the peak of his scholarly career. The year he began his post at the Hanbaliyya madrasa, was a time of political turmoil. The Mamluk sultan Al-Adil Kitbugha was deposed by his vice-sultan Al-Malik al- Mansur Lajin who then ruled from 1297 to 1299. Lajin had a desire to commission an expedition against the Christians of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia who formed an alliance with the Mongol Empire and taking part of the military campaign which lead to the destruction of Baghdad the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate and Harran the birthplace of Ibn Taymiyyah, for that purpose he urged Ibn Taymiyyah to call the Muslims to Jihad. In 1298, Ibn Taymiyyah wrote an explanation of the ayat al-mutashabihat (the unclear verses of the Qur'an) called Al-\`Aqidat al-Hamawiyat al-Kubra (The creed of the great people of Hama). The book is about divine attributes and it served as an answer to a question from the city of Hama, Syria. At that particular time Ash'arites held prominent positions within the Islamic scholarly community in both Syria and Egypt, and they held a certain position on the divine attributes of God. Ibn Taymiyyah in his book strongly disagreed with their views and this heavy opposition to the common Ash'ari position, caused considerable controversy. Ibn Taymiyyah collaborated once more with the Mamluks in 1300, when he joined the expedition against the Alawites and Shiites, in the Kasrawan region of the Lebanese mountains. Ibn Taymiyyah thought of the Alawites as \\"more heritical yet than Jews and Christians\\", (بالنصيرية هم وسائر أصناف القرامطة الباطنية أكفر من اليهود والنصارى ; بل وأكفر من كثير من المشركين),Ibn Taymiyyah [Majmoo\` al-Fatawa 35/145] إبن تيمية مجموع الفتاوي ٣٥/١٤٥ English translation of the Fatwa and according to Carole Hillenbrand, the confrontation with the Alawites resulted because they \\"were accused of collaboration with Christians and Mongols.\\" Ibn Taymiyya had further active involvements in campaigns against the Mongols and their alleged Alawite allies. = Second expedition against the Alawites = Ibn Taymiyyah took part in a second military offensive in 1305 against the Alawites and the Isma\`ilis in the Kasrawan region of the Lebanese mountains where they were defeated. The majority of the Alawis and Ismailis eventually converted to Twelver Shiism and settled in south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley, with a few Shia pockets that survived in the Lebanese mountains.  Involvement in Mongol invasion  Mongol invasion of Syria = First invasions = The first invasion took place between December 1299 and April 1300 due to the military campaign by the Mamluks against the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia who were allied with the Mongols. The Ilkhanate army managed to reach Damascus by the end of December 1299. Ibn Taymiyyah went with a delegation of Islamic scholars to talk to Ghazan Khan, who was the Khan of the Mongol Ilkhanate of Iran, to plead clemency and to stop his attack on the Muslims. It is reported that none of the scholars said anything to the Khan except Ibn Taymiyyah who said: > You claim that you are Muslim and you have with you Mu'adhdhins, Muftis, > Imams and Shaykhs but you invaded us and reached our country for what? While > your father and your grandfather, Hulagu were non-believers, they did not > attack and they kept their promise. But you promised and broke your promise. By early January 1300, the Mongol allies, the Armenians and Georgians, had caused widespread damage to Damascus and they had taken Syrian prisoners. The Mongols effectively occupied Damascus for the first four months of 1303. Most of the military had fled the city, including most of the civilians. Ibn Taymiyyah however, stayed and was one of the leaders of the resistance inside Damascus and he went to speak directly to the Ilkhan, Mahmud Ghazan, and his vizier Rashid al-Din Tabib. He sought the release of Muslim and dhimmi prisoners which the Mongols had taken in Syria, and after negotiation, secured their release.An artist illustrated of Ghazan Khan, a historical figure harshly rebuked by Ibn Taymiyyah, mainly due to his constant state of hostility towards the Mamluks of Egypt. = Second Mongol invasion = The second invasion lasted between October 1300 and January 1301. Ibn Taymiyyah at this time began giving sermons on jihad at the Umayyad mosque. Ibn Taymiyyah also spoke to and encouraged the Governor of Damascus, al-Afram, to achieve victory over the Mongols. He became involved with al-Afram once more, when he was sent to get reinforcements from Cairo. = Third invasion and fatwa = The year 1303 saw the third Mongol invasion of Syria by Ghazan Khan. What has been called Ibn Taymiyyah's \\"most famous\\" fatwāJanin, Hunt. Islamic Law: The Sharia from Muhammad's Time to the Present by Hunt Janin and Andre Kahlmeyer, McFarland and Co. Publishers, 2007 p.79 was issued against the Mongols in the Mamluk's war. Ibn Taymiyyah declared that jihad against the Mongol attack on the Malmuk sultanate was not only permissible, but obligatory. The reason being that the Mongols could not, in his opinion, be true Muslims despite the fact that they had converted to Sunni Islam because they ruled using what he considered 'man-made laws' (their traditional Yassa code) rather than Islamic law or Sharia, whilst believing that the Yassa code was better than the Sharia law. Because of this, he reasoned they were living in a state of jahiliyyah, or pre-Islamic pagan ignorance.Kepel, Gilles, The Prophet and the Pharaoh, (2003), p.194 The fatwa broke new Islamic legal ground because \\"no jurist had ever before issued a general authorization for the use of lethal force against Muslims in battle\\", and was to influence modern Islamists in the use of violence against self-proclaimed Muslims. Ibn Taymiyyah called on the Muslims to jihad once again and personally participated Battle of Marj al-Saffar against the Ilkhanid army. The battle began on 20 April of that year. On the same day, Ibn Taymiyyah declared a fatwa which exempted Mamluk soldiers from fasting during Ramadan so that they could preserve their strength. Within two days the Mongols were severely defeated and the battle was won.  Facing charges against his anthropomorphism  Ibn Taymiyyah was imprisoned several times for conflicting with the prevailing opinions of the jurists and theologians of his day. A judge from the city of Wasit, Iraq, requested that Ibn Taymiyyah write a book on creed. His subsequent creedal work, Al-Aqidah Al-Waasitiyyah, caused him trouble with the authorities. Ibn Taymiyyah adopted the view that God should be described as he was literally described in the Qur'an and in the hadith, and that all Muslims were required to believe this because according to him it was the view held by the early Muslim community (salaf). Within the space of two years (1305–1306) four separate religious council hearings were held to assess the correctness of his creed. = 1305 hearing = The first hearing was held with Shafi‘i scholars who accused Ibn Taymiyyah of anthropomorphism. At the time Ibn Taymiyyah was 42 years old. He was protected by the then Governor of Damascus, Aqqush al-Afram, during the proceedings. The scholars suggested that he accept that his creed was simply that of the Hanbalites and offered this as a way out of the charge. However, if Ibn Taymiyyah ascribed his creed to the Hanbali school of law then it would be just one view out of the four schools which one could follow rather than a creed everybody must adhere to. Uncompromising, Ibn Taymiyyah maintained that it was obligatory for all scholars to adhere to his creed. = 1306 hearings and imprisonment = Two separate councils were held a year later on 22 and 28 of January 1306. The first council was in the house of the Governor of Damascus Aqqush al-Afram, who had protected him the year before when facing the Shafii scholars. A second hearing was held six days later where the Indian scholar Safi al-Din al-Hindi found him innocent of all charges and accepted that his creed was in line with the \\"Qur'an and the Sunnah\\". Regardless, in April 1306 the chief Islamic judges of the Mamluk state declared Ibn Taymiyyah guilty and he was incarcerated. He was released four months later in September. = Further objections after release = After his release in Damascus, the doubts regarding his creed seemed to have resolved but this was not the case. A Shafii scholar, Ibn al-Sarsari, was insistent on starting another hearing against Ibn Taymiyyah which was held once again at the house of the Governor of Damascus, Al-Afram. His book Al-Aqidah Al-Waasitiyyah was still not found at fault. At the conclusion of this hearing, Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Sarsari were sent to Cairo to settle the problem.  Life in Egypt  = Debate on anthropomorphism and imprisonment = On arrival of Ibn Taymiyyah and the Shafi'ite scholar in Cairo in 1306, an open meeting was held. The Mamluk sultan at the time was Al-Nasir Muhammad and his deputy attended the open meeting. Ibn Taymiyyah was found innocent. Despite the open meeting, objections regarding his creed continued and he was summoned to the Citadel in Cairo for a munazara (legal debate), which took place on 8 April 1306. During the munazara, his views on divine attributes, specifically whether a direction could be attributed to God, were debated by the Indian scholar Safi al-Din al-Hindi, in the presence of Islamic judges. Ibn Taymiyyah failed to convince the judges of his position and so was incarcerated for the charge of anthropomorphism on the recommendation of al-Hindi. Thereafter, he together with his two brothers were imprisoned in the Citadel of the Mountain (Qal'at al-Jabal), in Cairo until 25 September 1307. He was freed due to the help he received from two amirs; Salar and Muhanna ibn Isa, but he was not allowed to go back to Syria. He was then again summoned for a legal debate, but this time he convinced the judges of his views and was allowed to go free. = Trial for intercession and imprisonment = Citadel of Cairo, the place where Ibn Taymiyyah was imprisoned for 18 months Ibn Taymiyyah continued to face troubles for his views which were found to be at odds with those of his contemporaries. His strong opposition to what he believed to be religious innovations, caused upset among the prominent Sufis of Egypt including Ibn Ata Allah and Karim al-Din al-Amuli, and the locals who started to protest against him. Their main contention was Ibn Taymiyyah's stance on tawassul (intercession). In his view, a person could not ask anyone other than God for help except on the Day of Judgement when intercession in his view would be possible. At the time, the people did not restrict intercession to just the Day of Judgement but rather they said it was allowed in other cases. Due to this, Ibn Taymiyyah, now aged 45, was ordered to appear before the Shafi'i judge Badr al-Din in March 1308 and was questioned on his stance regarding intercession. Thereafter, he was incarcerated in the prison of the judges in Cairo for some months. After his release, he was allowed to return to Syria, should he so wish. Ibn Taymiyyah however stayed in Egypt for a further five years. = House arrest in Alexandria = 1309, the year after his release, saw a new Mamluk sultan accede to the throne, Baibars al-Jashnakir. His reign, marked by economical and political unrest, only lasted a year. In August 1309, Ibn Taymiyyah was taken into custody and placed under house arrest for seven months in the new sultan's palace in Alexandria. He was freed when al-Nasir Muhammad retook the position of sultan on 4 March 1310. Having returned to Cairo a week later, he was received by al-Nasir. The sultan would sometimes consult Ibn Taymiyyah on religious affairs and policies during the rest of his three-year stay in Cairo. During this time he continued to teach and wrote his famous book Al-Kitab al-Siyasa al-shar'iyya (Treatise on the Government of the Religious Law), a book noted for its account of the role of religion in politics.  Return to Damascus and later years  He spent his last fifteen years in Damascus. Aged 50, Ibn Taymiyyah returned to Damascus via Jerusalem on 28 February 1313. Damascus was now under the governorship of Tankiz. There, Ibn Taymiyyah continued his teaching role as professor of Hanbali fiqh. This is when he taught his most famous student, Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya, who went on to become a noted scholar in Islamic history. Ibn Qayyim was to share in Ibn Taymiyyah's renewed persecution. Three years after his arrival in the city, Ibn Taymiyyah became involved in efforts to deal with the increasing Shia influence amongst Sunni Muslims. An agreement had been made in 1316 between the amir of Mecca and the Ilkhanid ruler Öljaitü, brother of Ghazan Khan, to allow a favourable policy towards Shi'ism in the city. Around the same time the Shia theologian Al-Hilli, who had played a crucial role in the Mongol ruler's decision to make Shi'ism the state religion of Persia, wrote the book Minhaj al-Karamah' (The Way of Charisma'), which dealt with the Shia doctrine of the Imamate and also served as a refutation of the Sunni doctrine of the caliphate. In response, Ibn Taymiyyah wrote his famous book, Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah, as a refutation of Al-Hilli's work. = Fatwa on divorce and imprisonment = In 1318, Ibn Taymiyyah wrote a treatise that would curtail the ease with which a Muslim man could divorce his wife. Ibn Taymiyyah's fatwa on divorce was not accepted by the majority of scholars of the time and this continued into the Ottoman era. However, almost every modern Muslim nation- state has come to adopt Ibn Taymiyyah's position on this issue of divorce. At the time he issued the fatwa, Ibn Taymiyyah revived an edict by the sultan not to issue fatwas on this issue but he continued to do so, saying, \\"I cannot conceal my knowledge\\". As in previous instances, he stated that his fatwa was based on the Qur'an and hadith. His view on the issue was at odds with the Hanbali position. This proved controversial among the people in Damascus as well as the Islamic scholars who opposed him on the issue. According to the scholars of the time, an oath of divorce counted as a full divorce and they were also of the view that three oaths of divorce taken under one occasion counted as three separate divorces. The significance of this was, that a man who divorces the same partner three times is no longer allowed to remarry that person until and if that person marries and divorces another man. Only then could the man, who took the oath, remarry his previous wife. Ibn Taymiyyah accepted this but rejected the validity of three oaths taken under one sitting to count as three separate divorces as long as the intention was not to divorce. Moreover, Ibn Taymiyyah was of the view that a single oath of divorce uttered but not intended, also does not count as an actual divorce. He stated that since this is an oath much like an oath taken in the name of God, a person must expiate for an unintentional oath in a similar manner. Due to his views and also by not abiding to the sultan's letter two years before forbidding him from issuing a fatwa on the issue, three council hearings were held, in as many years (1318, 1319 and 1320), to deal with this matter. The hearing were overseen by the Viceroy of Syria, Tankiz. This resulted in Ibn Taymiyyah being imprisoned on 26 August 1320 in the Citadel of Damascus. He was released about five months and 18 days later, on 9 February 1321, by order of the Sultan Al-Nasir. Ibn Taymiyyah was reinstated as teacher of Hanbali law and he resumed teaching. = Risāla on visiting tombs and final imprisonment = In 1310, Ibn Taymiyyah had written a risāla (treatise) called Ziyārat al- Qubūr or according to another source, Shadd al-rihal. It dealt with the validity and permissibility of making a journey to visit the tombs of prophets and saints. It is reported that in the book \\"he condemned the cult of saints\\" and declared that visiting Muhammad's grave was a blameworthy religious innovation. For this, Ibn Taymiyyah, was imprisoned in the Citadel of Damascus sixteen years later on 18 July 1326, aged 63, along with his student Ibn Qayyim. The sultan also prohibited him from issuing any further fatwas.. Hanbali scholar Ahmad ibn Umar al-Maqdisi accused Ibn Taymiyah of apostasy over the treatise. = Life in prison = The Citadel of Damascus, the prison Ibn Taymiyyah died in Ibn Taymiyyah referred to prison as \\"a divine blessing\\". During his incarceration he wrote that, \\"when a scholar forsakes what he knows of the Book of God and of the sunnah of His messenger and follows the ruling of a ruler which contravenes a ruling of God and his messenger, he is a renegade, an unbeliever who deserves to be punished in this world and in the hereafter.\\" Whilst in prison he faced opposition from the Maliki and Shafii Chief Justices of Damascus, Taḳī al-Dīn al-Ik̲h̲nāʾī. He remained in prison for over two years and ignored the sultan's prohibition, by continuing to deliver fatwas. During his incarceration Ibn Taymiyyah wrote three works which are extant; Kitāb Maʿārif al-wuṣūl, Rafʿ al-malām, and Kitāb al-Radd ʿala 'l-Ik̲h̲nāʾī (The response to al-Ik̲h̲nāʾī). The last book was an attack on Taḳī al-Dīn al-Ik̲h̲nāʾī and explained his views on saints (wali).  Death  Ibn Taymiyyah fell ill in early September 1328 and died at the age of 65, on 26 September of that year, whilst in prison at the Citadel of Damascus. Once this news reached the public, there was a strong show of support for him from the people. After the authorities had given permission, it is reported that thousands of people came to show their respects. They gathered in the Citadel and lined the streets up to the Umayyad Mosque. The funeral prayer was held in the citadel by scholar Muhammad Tammam, and a second was held in the mosque. A third and final funeral prayer was held by Ibn Taymiyyah's brother, Zain al- Din. He was buried in Damascus, in Maqbara Sufiyya (\\"the cemetery of the Sufis\\"). His brother Sharafuddin had been buried in that cemetery before him.George Makdisi, A Sufi of the Qadiriya Order, p 123.Juan Eduardo Campo, Encyclopedia of Islam, p 340. Oliver Leaman says that being deprived of the means of writing led to Ibn Taymiyyah's death. It is reported that two hundred thousand men and fifteen to sixteen thousand women attended his funeral prayer. Ibn Kathir says that in the history of Islam, only the funeral of Ahmad ibn Hanbal received a larger attendance. This is also mentioned by Ibn \`Abd al-Hadi. Caterina Bori says that, \\"In the Islamic tradition, wider popular attendance at funerals was a mark of public reverence, a demonstration of the deceased's rectitude, and a sign of divine approbation.\\" Ibn Taymiyya is said to have \\"spent a lifetime objecting to tomb veneration, only to cast a more powerful posthumous spell than any of his Sufi contemporaries.\\" On his death, his personal effects were in such demand \\"that bidders for his lice- killing camphor necklace pushed its price up to 150 dirhams, and his skullcap fetched a full 500.\\" A few mourners sought and succeeded in \\"drinking the water used for bathing his corpse.\\"Laoust, Henri, Essai sur les doctrines sociales et politiques de Taki-d-Din Ahmad b Timiya, Cairo, 1939, pp.149–50 His tomb received \\"pilgrims and sightseers\\" for 600 years. Almost 600 years after his death, the large Sufi cemetery where he was buried in was razed for redevelopment by French colonial authorities. His grave alone was left untouched after the Arab demolition teams \\"insisted\\" that his grave \\"was too holy to touch.\\" His resting place is now \\"in the parking lot of a maternity ward\\", though as of 2009 its headstone was broken, according to author Sadakat Kadri.Yahya Michot, [www.saphirnews.com/Pour-une-tombe-a-Damas_a4483.html Pour une tombe a Damas]Rédigé par Yahya Michot  Jeudi 21 Septembre 2006  Students  Several of Ibn Taymiyyah's students became scholars in their own right. His students came from different backgrounds and belonged to various different schools (madhabs). His most famous students were Ibn Qayyim Al- Jawziyya and Ibn Kathir. His other students include: * Al-Dhahabi * Al-Mizzi * Ibn Abd al-Hadi * Ibn Muflih * ʿImad al-Din Aḥmad al-Wasiti * Najm al-Din al- Tufi * Al Baʿlabakki * Al Bazzar * Ibn Qadi al-Jabal * Ibn Fadlillah al-Amri * Muhammad Ibn al-Manj * Ibn Abdus-Salam al-Batti * Ibn al-Wardi * Umar al- Harrani  Legacy  Many scholars have argued that Ibn Taymiyyah did not enjoy popularity among the intelligentsia of his day.Ibn Taymiyya, Radical Polymath, Part I: Scholarly Perceptions (Religion Compass, 2015), p. 101 Yossef Rapoport and Shahab Ahmed assert that he was a minority figure in his own times and the centuries that followed.Yossef Rapoport and Shahab Ahmed, Introduction in Ibn Taymiyya and His Times, eds. Yossef Rapoport and Shahab Ahmed (Karachi: Oxford University Press, 2010), 6. Caterina Bori goes further, arguing that despite popularity Ibn Taymiyya may have enjoyed among the masses, he appears to have been not merely unpopular among the scholars of his day, but somewhat of an embarrassment. Khalid El-Rouayheb notes similarly that Ibn Taymiyyah had \\"very little influence on mainstream Sunni Islam until the nineteenth century\\" and that he was \\"a little-read scholar with problematic and controversial views.\\" He also comments \\"the idea that Ibn Taymiyyah had an immediate and significant impact on the course of Sunni Islamic religious history simply does not cohere with the evidence that we have from the five centuries that elapsed between his death and the rise of Sunni revivalism in the modern period.\\" On the other hand, Prof. Al-Matroudi of SOAS university says that Ibn Taymiyyah, \\"was perhaps the most eminent and influential Hanbali jurist of the Middle Ages and one of the most prolific among them. He was also a renowned scholar of Islam whose influence was felt not only during his lifetime but extended through the centuries until the present day.\\" Ibn Taymiyyah's followers often deemed him as Sheikh ul-Islam, an honorific title with which he is sometimes still termed today.R.

In the pre-modern era, Ibn Taymiyyah was considered a controversial figure within Sunni Islam and had a number of critics during his life and in the centuries thereafter. The Shafi'i scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami stated that, He also stated that, Taqi al-Din al-Hisni condemned Ibn Taymiyya in even stronger terms by referring to him as the \\"heretic from Harran\\" and similarly, Munawi considered Ibn Taymiyyah to be an innovator though not an unbeliever. Taqi al-Din al-Subki criticised Ibn Taymiyyah for \\"contradicting the consensus of the Muslims by his anthropomorphism, by his claims that accidents exist in God, by suggesting that God was speaking in time, and by his belief in the eternity of the world.\\" Ibn Battūta (d. 770/1369) famously wrote a work questioning Ibn Taymiyyah's mental state.Little, Did Ibn Taymiyya Have a Screw Loose? 95 The possibility of psychological abnormalities not with-standing, Ibn Taymiyya's personality, by multiple accounts, was fiery and oftentimes unpredictable.Antony Black, The History of Islamic Political Thought (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2001), 154.Ibn Taymiyya, Radical Polymath, Part I: Scholarly Perceptions (Religion Compass, 2015), p. 105 The historian Al-Maqrizi said, regarding the rift between the Sunni Ash'ari's and Ibn Taymiyyah, \\"People are divided into two factions over the question of Ibn Taymiyyah; for until the present, the latter has retained admirers and disciples in Syria and Egypt.\\" Both his supporters and rivals grew to respect Ibn Taymiyyah because he was uncompromising in his views. Dhahabi's views towards Ibn Taymiyya were ambivalent.Little, Donald P. \\"Did Ibn Taymiyya Have a Screw Loose?\\" Studia Islamica, no. 41, 1975, pp. 103-104. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1595400 . His praise of Ibn Taymiyya is invariably qualified with criticism and misgivings and he considered him to be both a \\"brilliant Shaykh\\" and also \\"cocky\\" and \\"impetuous\\".Little, Donald P. \\"Did Ibn Taymiyya Have a Screw Loose?\\" Studia Islamica, no. 41, 1975, pp. 105. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1595400 .Caterina Bori. \\"A New Source for the Biography of Ibn Taymiyya.\\" Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, vol. 67, no. 3, 2004, pp. 321–348. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4145798 The Hanafi-Maturidi scholar 'Ala' al-Din al-Bukhari said that anyone that gives Ibn Taymiyya the title Shaykh al-Islām is a disbeliever. As a reaction, his contemporary Nasir ad-Din ad-Dimashqi wrote a refutation in which he quoted the 85 greatest scholars, from Ibn Taymiyyah's till his time, who called Ibn Taymiyyah with the title Shaykh al- Islam. Ibn Taymiyyah's works served as an inspiration for later Muslim scholars and historical figures, who have been regarded as his admirers or disciples. In the contemporary world, he may be considered at the root of Wahhabism, the Senussi order and other later reformist movements.\\"He has strongly influenced modern Islam for the last two centuries. He is the source of the Wahhābīyah, a reformist movement founded by Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhāb (died 1792), who took his ideas from Ibn Taymiyyah's writings. Ibn Taymiyyah also influenced various reform movements that have posed the problem of reformulating traditional ideologies by a return to sources. Ibn Taymiyyah has been noted to have influenced Rashid Rida, Abul A\`la Maududi, Sayyid Qutb, Hassan al-Banna, Abdullah Azzam, and Osama bin Laden. The terrorist organization Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant used a fatwa of Ibn Taymiyyah to justify the burning alive of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh. Ibn Taymiyyah's fatwa on Alawites as \\"more infidel than Christians and Jews\\" has been recited by Muslim Brotherhood affiliated scholar Yusuf al-Qaradawi and former Jaysh al-Islam leader Zahran Alloush.  Influences  Ibn Taymiyyah was taught by scholars who were renowned in their time. However, there is no evidence that any of the contemporary scholars influenced him. A strong influence on Ibn Taymiyyah was the founder of the Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence, Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Ibn Taymiyyah was trained in this school and he had studied Ibn Hanbal's Musnad in great detail, having studied it over multiple times. Though he spent much of his life following this school, in the end he renounced taqlid (blind following). His work was most influenced by the sayings and actions of the Salaf (first 3 generation of Muslims) and this showed in his work where he would give preference to the Salaf over his contemporaries. The modern Salafi movement derives its name from this school of thought. In what may justifiably be described as an unscrupulous attempt of magnifying the purported influence of Ibn Taymiyyah on Jewish theology, the claim of the late Pakistani Islamic scholar Mawdudi deserves to be mentioned; if only for the purpose of correcting the published record. In his treatise Tajdīd-o-Ahyā-e-Dīn (Lahore: Islamic Publications, 31st Printing: 1999, p. 76; English edition translated by Al-Ash\`ari titled: A Short History of the Revivalist Movement in Islam, Lahore: Islamic Publications, 9th edition: 2004, p. 43), Mawdudi advances the following claim about the influence of Ibn Taymiyyah by appealing to the authority of the great scholar Goldziher: \\"... he had acquired such an insight into the Jewish and Christian literatures and the differences between their religious sects that, according to Goldziher, no scholar who wanted to deal with the characters of the Bible could lose sight of and set aside the researches of Ibn-i-Taimiyyah.\\" As a matter of fact Goldziher expressed his views and analyses about Ibn Taymiyyah's influence in his The Zāhirīs (Engl. tr. 2008, pp. 173–177) as well as in his article on Ibn Taymiyyah in the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (Vol. 7, p. 72). In neither of the mentioned writings does Goldziher say anything amounting to what Mawdudi attributed to him in his above-cited claim. What Goldziher did write was the following: \\" In his writings he [i.e. Ibn Taymiyyah] is a zealous adversary of Greek philosophy, Judaism, and Christianity. By way of inciting the Muslims against them, he pointed to the Mongol invasion which had just swept over Syria, asserting that the visitation was in part due to the laxity of his co-religionists. He issued a fatwa demanding that the Jewish synagogues in Cairo should be destroyed, and urging his people not to allow the chapels of other faiths to exist in their midst...\\"''  Views  = God's Attributes = Ibn Taymiyyah said that God should be described as he has described himself in the Qur'an and the way Prophet Muhammad has described God in the Hadith. He rejected; the Ta'tili's who denied these attributes, those who compare God with the creation (Tashbih) and those who engage in esoteric interpretations (ta'wil) of the Qur'an or use symbolic exegesis. Ibn Taymiyyah said that those attributes which we know about from the two above mentioned sources, should be ascribed to God. Anything regarding God's attributes which people have no knowledge of, should be approached in a manner, according to Ibn Taymiyyah, where the mystery of the unknown is left to God (called tafwid) and the Muslims submit themselves to the word of God and the Prophet (called taslim). Henri Laoust says that through this framework, this doctrine, \\"provides authority for the widest possible scope in personal internationalization of religion.\\" In 1299, Ibn Taymiyyah wrote the book Al-Aqida al-hamawiyya al-kubra, which dealt with, among other topics, theology and creed. When he was accused of anthropomorphism, a private meeting was held between scholars in the house of Al-Din \`Umar al-Kazwini who was a Shafii judge. After careful study of this book, he was cleared of those charges. Ibn Taymiyyah also wrote another book dealing with the attributes of God called, Al-Aqidah Al-Waasitiyyah. He faced considerable hostility towards these views from the Ash'ari's of whom the most notable were, Taqi al-Din al-Subki and his son Taj al-Din al-Subki who were influential Islamic jurists and also chief judge of Damascus in their respective times. Ibn Taymiyyah's highly intellectual discourse at explaining \\"The Wise Purpose of God, Human Agency, and the Problems of Evil & Justice\\" using God's attributes as a means has been illustrated by Dr. Jon Hoover in his work Ibn Taymiyyah's Theodicy of Perpetual Optimism. = Duration of Hellfire = Ibn Taymiyyah held the belief that Hell was not eternal even for unbelievers. According to Ibn Taymiyyah, Hell is therapeutic and reformative, and God's wise purpose in chastising unbelievers is to make them fit to leave the Fire. This view contradicted the mainstream Sunni doctrine of eternal hell-fire for unbelievers. Ibn Taymiyyah was criticised for holding this view by the chief Shafi scholar Taqi al-Din al-Subki who presented a large body of Qur'anic evidence to argue that unbelievers will abide in hell-fire eternally. Ibn Taymiyyah was partially supported in his view by the Zaydi Shi'ite Ibn al- Wazir. = Sources of Shari'a = Of the four fundamental sources of the sharia accepted by thirteenth century Sunni jurists— #Qur'an, #sunnah, #consensus of jurists (ijma), and #qiyas (analogical reasoning), —Ibn Taymiyyah opposed the use of consensus of jurists, replacing it with the consensus of the \\"companions\\" (sahaba). Like all Islamic jurists Ibn Taymiyyah believed in a hierarchy sources for the Sharia. Most important was the Quran, and the sunnah or any other source could not abrogate a verse of the Qur'an. (For him, an abrogation of a verse, known in Arabic as Naskh, was only possible through another verse in the Qur'an.) Next was sunnah which other sources (besides the Quran) must not contradict.  Consensus (ijma)  Concerning Consensus (ijma), he believed that consensus of any Muslims other than that of the companions of Muhammad could not be \\"realistically verifiable\\" and so was speculative, and thus not a legitimate source of Islamic law (except in certain circumstances). The consensus (ijma) used must be that of the companions found in their reported sayings or actions. According one supporter, Serajul Haque, his rejection of the consensus of other scholars was justified, on the basis of the instructions given to the jurist Shuraih ibn al-Hârith from the Caliph Umar, one of the companions of Muhammad; to make decisions by first referring to the Qur'an, and if that is not possible, then to the sayings of the Prophet and finally to refer to the agreement of the companions like himself. An example of Ibn Taymiyyah use of his interpretation was in defense of the (temporary) closing of all Christian churches in 1299 in the Mamluk Sultanate. The closing was in violation of a 600-year-old covenant with Christian dhimmis known as the Pact of Umar. But as Ibn Taymiyyah pointed out, while venerable, the pact was written 60 years or so after the time of the companions and so had no legal effect.  Analogy (qiyas)  Ibn Taymiyyah considered the use of analogy (qiyas) based on literal meaning of scripture as a valid source for deriving legal rulings. Analogy is the primary instrument of legal rationalism in Islam. He acknowledged its use as one of the four fundamental principles of Islamic jurisprudence. Ibn Taymiyyah argued against the certainty of syllogistic arguments and in favour of analogy. He argues that concepts founded on induction are themselves not certain but only probable, and thus a syllogism based on such concepts is no more certain than an argument based on analogy. He further claimed that induction itself depends on a process of analogy. His model of analogical reasoning was based on that of juridical arguments., pp. 16–36 Work by John F. Sowa have, for example, have used Ibn Taymiyyah's model of analogy. He attached caveats however to the use of analogy because he considered the use of reason to be secondary to the use of revelation. Ibn Taymiyyah's view was that analogy should be used under the framework of revelation, as a supporting source. There were some jurists who thought rulings derived through analogy could contradict a ruling derived from the Qur'an and the authentic hadith. However, Ibn Taymiyyah disagreed because he thought a contradiction between the definitive canonical texts of Islam, and definitive reason was impossible and that this was also the understanding of the salaf. Racha el-Omari says that on an epistemological level, Ibn Taymiyyah considered the Salaf to be better than any other later scholars in understanding the agreement between revelation and reason. One example for this is the use of analogy in the Islamic legal principle of maslaha (public good) about which Ibn Taymiyya believed, if there were to be any contradiction to revelation then it is due to a misunderstanding or misapplication of the concept of utility. He said that to assess the utility of something, the criteria for benefit and harm should come from the Qur'an and sunnah, a criterion which he also applied to the establishment of a correct analogy. An example of Ibn Taymiyyah's use of analogy was in a fatwa forbidding the use of hashish one the grounds that it was analogous to wine, and users should be given 80 lashes in punishment. \\"Anyone who disagreed was an apostate, he added, whose corpse ought not to be washed or given a decent burial.\\" = Prayer (Duʿāʾ) = Ibn Taymiyyah issued a fatwa deeming it acceptable to perform dua in languages other than Arabic: > It is permissible to make du’aa’ in Arabic and in languages other than > Arabic. Allaah knows the intention of the supplicant and what he wants, no > matter what language he speaks, because He hears all the voices in all > different languages, asking for all kinds of needs. This view was also shared by an earlier theologian and jurist, Abu Hanifa. = Reason (\`Aql) = Issues surrounding the use of reason ('Aql) and rational came about in relation to the attributes of God for which he faced much resistance. At the time, Ashari and Maturidi theologians thought the literal attributes of God as stated in the Qur'an were contradictory to reason so sought to interpret them metaphorically. Ibn Taymiyyah believed that reason itself validated the entire Qur'an as being reliable and in light of that he argued, if some part of the scripture was to be rejected then this would render the use of reason as an unacceptable avenue through which to seek knowledge. He thought that the most perfect rational method and use of reason was contained within the Qur'an and sunnah and that the theologians of his time had used rational and reason in a flawed manner. = Criticism of the grammarians = Ibn Taymiyyah had mastered the grammar of Arabic and one of the books which he studied was the book of Arabic grammar called Al-Kitab, by Sibawayh. In later life he met the Quranic exegete and grammarian Abu Hayyan al-Gharnati to whom he expressed that, \\"Sibawayh was not the prophet of syntax, nor was he infallible. He committed eighty mistakes in his book which are not intelligible to you.\\" Ibn Taymiyyah is thought to have severely criticized Sibawayh but the actual substance of those criticisms is not known because the book within which he wrote the criticisms, al-Bahr, has been lost. He stated that when there is an explanation of an Ayah of the Qur'an or a Hadith, from the Prophet himself, the use of philology or a grammatical explanation becomes obsolete. He also said one should refer only to the understanding of the Salaf (first three generations of Muslims) when interpreting a word within the scriptural sources. However he did not discount the contributions of the grammarians completely. Ibn Taymiyyah stated that the Arabic nouns within the scriptural sources have been divided by the fuqaha (Islamic jurists) into three categories; those that are defined by the shari'a, those defined by philology (lugha) and finally those that are defined by social custom (\`urf). For him each of these categories of nouns had to be used in their own appropriate manner. = Maddhabs = Ibn Taymiyyah censured the scholars for blindly conforming to the precedence of early jurists without any resort to the Qur'an and Sunnah. He contended that although juridical precedence has its place, blindly giving it authority without contextualization, sensitivity to societal changes, and evaluative mindset in light of the Qur'an and Sunnah can lead to ignorance and stagnancy in Islamic Law. Ibn Taymiyyah likened the extremism of Taqlid (blind conformity to juridical precedence or school of thought) to the practice of Jews and Christians who took their rabbis and ecclesiastics as gods besides God. In arguing against taqlid, he said the salaf, who in order to better understand and live according to the commands of God, had to make ijtihad using the scriptural sources. The same approach, in his view, was needed in modern times. Ibn Taymiyyah believed that the best role models for Islamic life were the first three generations of Islam (Salaf); which constitute Muhammad's companions, referred to in Arabic as Sahaba (first generation), followed by the generation of Muslims born after the death of Muhammad known as the Tabi'un (second generation) which is then followed lastly by the next generation after the Tabi'un known as Tabi' Al-Tabi'in (third generation). Ibn Taymiyyah gave precedence to the ideas of the Sahaba and early generations, over the founders of the Islamic schools of jurisprudence. For Ibn Taymiyyah it was the Qur'an, the sayings and practices of Muhammad and the ideas of the early generations of Muslims that constituted the best understanding of Islam. Any deviation from their practice was viewed as bid'ah, or innovation, and to be forbidden. He also praised and wrote a commentary on some speeches of Abdul-Qadir Gilani. = Islamic law and policy = Ibn Taymiyya believed that Islamic policy and management was based on , and that the goal of al-siyasa (politics, the political) should be to protect al-din (religion) and to manage al-dunya (worldly life and affairs). Religion and the State should be inextricably linked, in his view, as the state was indispensable in providing justice to the people, enforcing Islamic law by enjoining good and forbidding evil, unifying the people and preparing a society conducive to the worship of God. He believed that \\"enjoining good and forbidding wrong\\" was the duty of every state functionary with charge over other Muslims, from the caliph to \\"the schoolmaster in charge of assessing children's handwriting exercises.\\"Ibn Taymiyya, Le traite de droit public d'ibn Taimiya. Translated by Henri Laoust. Beirut, 1948, p.12 Ibn Taymiyyah supported giving broad powers to the state. In Al-siyasa al-Shar\`iyah, he focused on duties of individuals and punishments rather than rules and procedural limits of authorities. Suspected highway robbers who would not reveal their accomplices or the location of their loot, for example should be held in detention and lashed for indefinite periods. He also allowed the lashing of imprisoned debtors, and \\"trials of suspicion\\" (da\`sawi al-tuham) where defendants could be convicted without witnesses or documentary proof. Henri Laoust said that Ibn Taymiyyah never propagated the idea of a single caliphate but believed the Muslim ummah or community would form into a confederation of states. Laoust further stated that Ibn Taymiyyah called for obedience only to God, and the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, and he did not put a limit on the number of leaders a Muslim community could have. However Mona Hassan, in her recent study of the political thoughts of Ibn Taymiyyah, questions this and says laoust has wrongly claimed that Ibn Taymiyyah thought of the caliphate as a redundant idea. Hassan has shown that Ibn Taymiyyah considered the Caliphate that was under the Rashidun Caliphs; Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali, as the moral and legal ideal. The Caliphate in his view could not be ceded \\"in favour of secular kingship (mulk). = Jihad = Ibn Taymiyyah was noted for emphasis he put on the importance of jihad and for the \\"careful and lengthy attention\\" he gave \\"to the questions of martyrdom\\" in jihad, such as benefits and blessings to be had for martyrs in the afterlife. He asserted that martyrdom and eternal rewards and blessings, . He wrote that, \\"It is in jihad that one can live and die in ultimate happiness, both in this world and in the Hereafter. Abandoning it means losing entirely or partially both kinds of happiness.\\" He defined jihad as: > It comprehends all sorts of worship, whether inward or outward, including > love for Allah, being sincere to Him, relying on Him, relinquishing one's > soul and property for His sake, being patient and austere, and keeping > remembrance of Almighty Allah. It includes what is done by physical power, > what is done by the heart, what is done by the tongue through calling to the > way of Allah by means of authoritative proofs and providing opinions, and > what is done through management, industry, and wealth.Bin Bayyah, The > Concept of Jihad . He gave a broad definition of what constituted \\"aggression\\" against Muslims and what actions by non-believers made jihad against them permissible. He declared > It is allowed to fight people for (not observing) unambiguous and generally > recognized obligations and prohibitions, until they undertake to perform the > explicitly prescribed prayers, to pay zakat, to fast during the month of > Ramadan, to make the pilgrimage to Mecca and to avoid what is prohibited, > such as marrying women in spite of legal impediments, eating impure things, > acting unlawfully against the lives and properties of Muslims and the like. > It is obligatory to take the initiative in fighting those people, as soon as > the Prophet's summons with the reasons for which they are fought has reached > them. But if they first attack the Muslims then fighting them is even more > urgent, as we have mentioned when dealing with the fighting against > rebellious and aggressive bandits. In the modern context, his rulings have been used by some Islamist groups to declare jihad against various governments. = Innovation (Bid\`ah) = Even though Ibn Taymiyyah has been called a theologian, he claimed to reject \`ilm al-kalam, known as Islamic theology, as well as some aspects of Sufism and Peripatetic philosophy, as an innovation (Bid'ah). Despite this, Ibn Taymiyyah's works contained numerous arguments that openly refer to rational arguments (kalam) for their validity and therefore he must be included amongst the Mutakallimin. Ibn Taymiyyah opposed giving any undue religious honors to mosques (even that of Jerusalem, the Al-Aqsa Mosque), to approach or rival in any way the Islamic sanctity of the two most holy mosques within Islam, Masjid al-Haram (in Mecca) and Al-Masjid al-Nabawi (in Madina).\\"A Muslim Iconoclast (Ibn Taymiyyeh) on the 'Merits' of Jerusalem and Palestine\\", by Charles D. Matthews, Journal of the American Oriental Society, volume 56 (1935), pp. 1–21. [Includes Arabic text of manuscript of Ibn Taymiyya's short work Qa'ida fi Ziyarat Bayt-il-Maqdis قاعدة في زيارة بيت المقدس] As to the practice of making journey for the sole purpose of visiting a mosque, Ibn Taymiyyah has said in his books; Majmu'at al-Rasail al-Kubra, Minhaj al-Sunna and Majmu'at Fatawa, that, \\"Journey must not be made except to three mosques; Masjid al- Haram, Masjid al-Nabawi and Masjid Al-Aqsa\\". Regarding this Serajul Haque says that, \\"In the opinion of Ibn Taymiyyah only these three mosques have been accepted by the Prophet as the object of journeys, on account of their excellence over all other mosques and places of prayer. Ibn Taymiyyah uses a saying (hadith) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in Bukhari and Muslim to justify his view that it is not permitted to journey exclusively to any mosque than Mecca, Medina, or Jerusalem. =Existence of saints= Although it is sometimes supposed that Ibn Taymiyyah rejected the very idea of saints, which had become a cardinal Sunni belief in the medieval period,Jonathan A.C. Brown, \\"Faithful Dissenters: Sunni Skepticism about the Miracles of Saints\\", Journal of Sufi Studies 1 (2012), p. 123Christopher Taylor, In the Vicinity of the Righteous (Leiden: Brill, 1999), pp. 5-6John Renard, Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008); Idem., Tales of God Friends: Islamic Hagiography in Translation (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009, et passim). scholarship has shown that this is not true.Josef W. Meri, The Cult of Saints among Muslims and Jews in Medieval Syria (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 68 Nevertheless, it's important to note that the term saint (wali) in Islam is not equal to the Catholic definition of it. Saint in islamic theology designates righteous people from the past, who became well-known for their piety. There is, though, no process of canonization or veneration of icons, which is strongly condemned in Islam as violations of the basic monotheism. Indeed, while Ibn Taymiyyah did indeed reject widely-established orthodox practices associated with the veneration of saints in Islam at his time, like the visitation to their graves and the seeking of their intercession, he never rejected the actual existence of saints as such. On the contrary, he explicitly states: \\"The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars. And the Qur'an has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are only people who are innovators and their followers.\\"Ibn Taymiyyah, al-Mukhtasar al- Fatawa al-Masriyya, 1980, p. 603 In this particular respect, he differed little from all his contemporaries; for just as practically all of the era's scholars believed that \\"the lives of saints and their miracles were incontestable\\", so also did Ibn Taymiyyah. Ibn Taymiyyah's most categorical declaration of accepting the existence of saints and their miracles appears in his famous creed 'Aqīda al-Wāsitīya, in which he states: \\"Among the fundamentals of the belief of the People of the Sunna is belief in the miracles of the saints (karāmāt al-awliyā) and the supernatural acts which God achieves through them in all varieties of knowledge, illuminations (mukāshafāt), power, and impressions as it is handed down about the ancient nations in the chapter of the Cave and in other Quranic chapters and is known of the early men among this Community of Believers among the Companions and Followers and the rest of the generations of this Community of Believers. It [the blessing of having saints and saintly miracles] will be with them until the Day of Resurrection.\\" Although Ibn Taymiyyah was critical of some of the developments within Sufism, he never rejected the practice outright, and actually enumerated a list of early Sufis whom he considered to be among the greatest Islamic saints.See Ibn Taymiyyah, Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya (Cairo: Dar ar-Rahmat, u.d.), Vol. 10, p. 516 In this list, he included Bayazid Bastami, Junayd of Baghdad, Abdul-Qadir Gilani, Hasan of Basra, Ibrahim ibn Adham, Maruf Karkhi, Sirri Saqti, and several other venerable personages who have always been venerated in mainstream Sunni Islam as being among the greatest saints of all.See Ibn Taymiyyah, Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya (Cairo: Dar ar-Rahmat, u.d.), Vol. 10, p. 516; for the traditional narratives of these saints, see: John Renard, Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008). Regarding all these early saints, Ibn Taymiyyah even declares: \\"These great Sufi people were the leaders of humanity, and they were calling to what is right and forbidding what is wrong.\\"Ibn Taymiyyah, Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya (Cairo: Dar ar-Rahmat, u.d.), Vol. 10, p. 516 While Ibn Taymiyyah did indeed reject the veneration of saints who promulgated the Akbari doctrine of wahdat al- wajud, he never rejected the venerability of saints who belonged to all the other Sufi orders.See Ibn Taymiyyah, Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya (Cairo: Dar ar-Rahmat, u.d.), Vol. 10 =Visitation of the tombs of the Prophets and the saints= Ibn Taymiyyah considered the visitation of the tombs of Prophets and saints as impermissible, a blameworthy innovation and comparable to worshiping something besides God (shirk). This view was vigorously rejected by Sunni scholars both during his life and after his death. The Shafi'i scholar Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani stated that \\"This is one of the ugliest positions that has been reported of Ibn Taymiyya\\" and also added that travelling to visit the tomb of the Prophet was \\"one of the best of actions and the noblest of pious deeds with which one draws near to God, and its legitimacy is a matter of consensus.\\" The Hanafi hadith scholar Ali al-Qari stated that, \\"Amongst the Hanbalis, Ibn Taymiyya has gone to an extreme by prohibiting travelling to visit the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace\\" Qastallani stated that \\"The Shaykh Taqi al-Din Ibn Taymiyya has abominable and odd statements on this issue to the effect that travelling to visit the Prophet is prohibited and is not a pious deed.\\" Other scholars in opposition to Ibn Taymiyyah's views include Ghazali, Nawawi, Munawi and Qadi Ayyad who stated that visiting the Prophet was \\"a sunna of the Muslims on which there was consensus, and a good and desirable deed.\\" =Intercession= Ibn Taymiyyah said that seeking the assistance of God through intercession is allowed, as long as the other person is still alive. However, he believed that those who ask assistance from the grave of the Prophet or saints, are mushrikin (polytheists), someone who is engaged in shirk. This view was also vigorously rejected by mainstream Sunni scholars. For example, the chief judge of Damascus, Taqi al-Din al-Subki stated that, \\"It is proper to entreat and ask for the help and intercession of the Prophet ﷺ with God. No one from amongst the salaf and khalaf denied this, until Ibn Taymiyya came along and disapproved of this, and deviated from the straight path, and invented a position that no scholar has said before, and he became a deterrent example for Muslims\\". Similarly, Ibn Hajar rejected Ibn Taymiyya's view on intercession and held that he had broken with the established consensus of Sunni scholars, as did many other scholars such as Zurqani and Khalil ibn Ishaq. = Mutakallimun = The mutakallimun are scholars who engage in ilm al-Kalam (rationalist theology) and they were criticised by Ibn Taymiyyah for their use of rationalist theology and philosophy. He said that the method of kalam was used by the Mu\`tazilites, Jahmites and Ash\`ari's. Ibn Taymiyyah considered the use of philosophical proofs and kalam to be redundant because he saw the Qur'an and the Sunna as superior rational proofs. Ibn Taymiyyah said that these explanations were not grounded in scriptural evidence such as the philosophical explanation of the divine attributes of God or the proof of God using the cosmological argument. He said that the call to Islam was not made using such methods by the Qur'an or the Prophet and that these theories have only caused errors and corruption. The mutakallimun called their use of rationalist theology \\"Usul al-Din\\" (principles of religion) but Ibn Taymiyyah said that the use of rationalist theology has nothing to do with the true usul al-din which comes from God and to state otherwise is to say that the Prophet neglected an important aspect of Islam. Ibn Taymiyyah says that the usul al-din of the mutakallimun, deserve to be named usul din al-shaytan (principles of Satanic religion). Ibn Taymiyyah's attempts to focus attention onto Qur'anic rationality was taken up by his student Ibn Qayyim, to the exception of his other followers. This focus on traditionlist rationlism was also taken up by Musa Bigiev. Despite his critical stance, one of Ibn Taymiyyah's last direct students, Ibn Qadi al- Jabal (d. 1370), says that \\"Ibn Taymiyya used to praise the expansiveness of al-Ash'ari’s knowledge and would quote the latter’s works by memory in public lessons (al-majalis al-a'mma), in particular al-Iba'na\\", that he talked highly of later Ash'ari scholars like Al-Baqillani and Al-Juwayni and as for Al- Ghazali, having studied his books with Ibn Taymiyyah, he says that \\"Ibn Taymiyyah told those present how impressed he was by al-Ghazali’s eloquence and the extent of his knowledge.\\"Rodrigo Adem, \\"Ibn Taymiyya as Avicennan? Fourteenth‐Century Cosmological Controversies in Damascus\\" in The Muslim World, Volume 108, Issue 1, January 2018, Page 147 = Sufism = Ibn Taymiyyah belonged to the Qadiriyya tariqa (order) of Sufism and claimed to inherit the khirqa (spiritual mantle) of the founder of the Qadiriyya order 'Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani. Among his explicit positive references to Sufism and the Qadiriyya tariqa in particular, Ibn Taymiyyah referred to Jilani as \\"Shaykhuna\\" (our Shaykh) and \\"Sayyidi\\" (my master). He spoke highly of a great many other Sufi Shaykhs also such as Abu Yazid al-Bistami and al-Junayd, and went to great lengths to state that Sufism is not a heretical innovation (bid'ah). Gibril Haddad, a contemporary Sunni scholar who's often critical of Ibn Taymiyyah's doctrinal positions, notes, after cementing his affiliation with the Qadiri order, that \\"insofar as the goal of tasawwuf is the purification of the heart by progress through states (ahwal) and stations (maqamat), Ibn Taymiyya in al-Tuhfat al-'Iraqiyya (al-Zarqa’ Jordan 1978, p. 18) imitated Imam al-Ghazali's fatwa in al-Munqidh min al-Dalal in considering tasawwuf obligatory upon every Muslim, naming it a'mal al-qulub.\\"Gibril Fouad Haddad's introduction in Ibn Jahbal Al-Kilabi, The Refutation Of Him [Ibn Taymiyya] Who Attributes Direction To Allah, Aqsa Publications (2008), p. 47 Despite this, Ibn Taymiyyah rejected two views associated with some extreme Sufis. Firstly, he rejected monism which he believed was similar to the pantheistic belief that God \\"encompasses all things\\". This rejection included denouncing the views of Ibn Arabi. Secondly he said that the view that spiritual enlightenment is of a greater importance than obeying the sharia was a failure to properly follow the example of Muhammad. On Ibn Arabi, and Sufism in general, Henri Laoust says that Ibn Taymiyyah never condemned Sufism in itself, but only that which he considered to be, inadmissible deviations in doctrine, ritual or morals, such as monism, antinomianism or esotericism. Scholar Arjan Post, in the introduction to the edition and English translation of Risālat al-sulūk (Epistle on the Spiritual Way) by al-Baʿlabakkī (d. 734/1333), a Lebanon-born Hanbali Sufi and direct student of Ibn Taymiyyah, talks of a \\"Sufi circle\\" among his students, notably through ʿImād al-Dīn Aḥmad al-Wāsiṭī, who \\"fulfilled the role of Sufi shaykh in the Taymiyyan circle until he passed away in 711/1311\\", and who was appreciated by other famous direct or indirect students of Ibn Taymiyyah who became famous scholars, notably Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya, Ibn Rajab and Al-Dhahabi.Arjan Post, \\"A Glimpse of Sufism from the Circle of Ibn Taymiyya: An Edition and Translation of al-Baʿlabakkī’s (d. 734/1333) Epistle on the Spiritual Way (Risālat al-Sulūk)\\" in Journal of Sufi studies 5 (2016) 162–163 = Shi'a Islam = Ibn Taymiyyah was extremely critical of Shia and considered them religiously bankrupt, among the most morally depraved people and the root cause of many Islamic ills. His severe critique of Twelver Shia in his book, Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah, was written in response to the book Minhaj al- karama fi ma'rifat al-imama, by the Shia theologian Al-Hilli. He focused his criticisms to the similarity between Shia, Christians and Jews. Regarding the Shia mourning for Husayn on Ashura, Ibn Taymiyyah considered Husayn's martyrdom as a divinely bestowed honour—not a major tragedy. He also argued that such mourning was never instructed by Muhammad and that the Islamic response to recent (let alone ancient) loss is not extravagant mourning but to endure the loss with patience and trust in God. However, he also believed those who celebrated on Ashura were anti-Shia zealots (\\"an-Nāṣibiyyah\\") or ignorant people. Fathi Shaqaqi, the Sunni Islamist inspired by the Islamic revolution of Iran who founded the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, said that Ibn Taymiyyah didn't consider Twelver Shi'as, that is the majority of the Shi'as, to be heretics, but mainly sects like the Ismailis, also precising that the geopolitical context of the day played a role in his thinking, and that, among Sunni scholars, \\"fatwas such as his were not disseminated, despite the fact that the Shi‘a had by then been in existence for some 600 years.\\"Meir Hatina, \\"Debating the “Awakening Shi‘a”: Sunni Perceptions of the Iranian Revolution\\" in O. Bengio & Meir Litvak, \\"The Sunna and Shi'a in History: Division and Ecumenism in the Muslim Middle East\\", Springer (2010), p. 210 Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, one of the most influential modern jihadi ideologues, bases himself on Ibn Taymiyyah to say that the laypeople among the Shi'as are not to be considered disbelievers.\\"A Virulent Ideology in Mutation: Zarqawi Upstages Maqdisi\\" , September 2015, Hudson Institute. = Christianity = He wrote polemics against Christians. His book is the largest refutation of Christian dogmas ever written in Islamic history. = Druze = Ibn Taymiyya dismissed the Druze as non-Muslims, which in that setting would have legitimized violence against them as apostates. = Non-Muslims = Ibn Taymiyyah witnessed conversions to Islam as a growing trend among many Mongols.Ibn Taymiyyah strongly opposed borrowing from Christianity or other non-Muslim religions. In his text On the Necessity of the Straight Path (kitab iqtida al-sirat al-mustaqim) he preached that the beginning of Muslim life was the point at which \\"a perfect dissimilarity with the non-Muslims has been achieved.\\" To this end he opposed the celebration of the observance of the birthday of the Islamic prophet Muhammad or the construction of mosques around the tombs of Muslim saints saying: \\"Many of them (the Muslims) do not even know of the Christian origins of these practices.\\"Muhammad \`Umar Memon, Ibn Taymiyya's Struggle against Popular Religion, with an annotated translation of Kitab Iqitada, the Hague, (1976) p.78, 210 = Economic views = He elaborated a circumstantial analysis of market mechanism, with a theoretical insight unusual in his time. Regarding the power of supply and demand, Ibn Taymiyyah said, \\"If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down.\\" His discourses on the welfare advantages and disadvantages of market regulation and deregulation, have an almost contemporary ring to them. However, he also advocated a policy of \\"fair prices\\" and \\"fair profits\\", with the implication that anything higher would be impious. Such forms of price fixing was detrimental to entrepreneurship. =Eternity of Species= He argued that there was an alternate view to the view held by philosophers, like Ibn Sina, who claimed the universe was eternal in its entirety, and Islamic scholars, like Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, who claimed that the universe was created from nothing by God. In his Sharh Hadith Imran ibn Hasan, Ibn Taymiyya distinguishes between species and elements, asserting that the former are eternal with God. He states: \\"If it is supposed that the species [of things done] has been with Him from eternity, neither revelation nor reason denies this 'withness' (ma^iyya). On the contrary, it is part of His perfection.\\" In fact, Ibn Taymiyya draws this assertion from his belief that God perpetually creates, i.e. in preeternity. John Hoover, in his Perpetual Creativity In The Perfection Of God: Ibn Taymiyya's Hadith Commentary On God's Creation Of This World, elaborates, \\"Following in the footsteps of Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd, Ibn Taymiyya then roots God's perpetual creativity in a Neoplatonic concept of God's perfection. Power and creativity are necessary concomitants of God's perfection. If God's creativity were not perpetual, God would have been devoid of His creativity, as well as other attributes of perfection, in pre- eternity.\\" = View on non-Arabs = Ibn Taymiyyah was also known to believe that non-Arab Muslims were inferior to Arab Muslims.  Assessment  = Salafism = Ibn Taymiyyah is thought by some to be the main influence behind the emergence of Salafism. He placed an emphasis on understanding Islam as it was understood by the salaf (first three generations of Muslims). = Modern Islamism = Various concepts within modern Islamism can be attributed to Ibn Taymiyyah. His influence is noted by Yahya Michot who says Ibn Taymiyyah \\"has thus become a sort of forefather of al-Qaeda.\\" One reason for this was his categorising the world into distinct territories: the domain of Islam (dar al- Islam), where the rule is of Islam and sharia law is enforced; the domain of unbelief (dar-al-kufr) ruled by unbelievers; and the domain of war (dar al- harb) which is territory under the rule of unbelievers who are involved in an active or potential conflict with the domain of Islam. (Ibn Taymiyyah included a fourth. When the Mongols, whom he considered unbelievers, took control of the city of Mardin the population included many Muslims. Believing Mardin was neither the domain of Islam, as Islam was not legally applied with an armed forces consisting of Muslims, nor the domain of war because the inhabitants were Muslim, Ibn Taymiyyah created a new \\"composite\\" category, known as dar al-\`ahd.) A second concept is making a declaration of apostasy (takfir) against a Muslim who does not obey Islam. But at the same time Ibn Taymiyyah maintained that no one can question anothers faith and curse them as based on one's own desire, because faith is defined by God and the Prophet. He said, rather than cursing or condemning them, an approach should be taken where they are educated about the religion. A further concept attributed to Ibn Taymiyyah is, \\"the duty to oppose and kill Muslim rulers who do not implement the revealed law (shari'a). Ibn Taymiyyah's role in the Islamist movements of the twentieth and twenty first century have also been noted by, the previous Coordinator for Counterterrorism at the United States Department of State, Daniel Benjamin who labels the chapter on the history of modern Islamic movements in his book The Age of Sacred Terror, as \\"Ibn Taymiyya and His children\\". Yossef Rapoport, a reader in Islamic history at Queen Mary, however, says this is not a probable narrative. = Mardin fatwa and the Mardin Conference = One of Ibn Taymiyyah's most famous fatwas is regarding the Mongols who had conquered and destroyed the Abbasid caliphate in 1258 and had then converted to Islam. Once they were in control of Mardin, they behaved unjustly with their subjects so the people of Mardin asked Ibn Taymiyyah for a legal verdict regarding the classification of the territory under which they live. He categorized the territory as dar al-\`ahd which in some ways is similar to dar al-kufr (domain of unbelievers). Included in his verdict was declaring the Mongol ruler Ghazan and other Mongols who did not accept shari'a in full, as unbelievers. According to Nettler and Kéchichian, Ibn Taymiyyah affirmed that Jihad against the Mongols, \\"was not only permissible but obligatory because the latter ruled not according to Sharīʿah but through their traditional, and therefore manmade, Yassa code. This essentially meant that Mongols were living in a state of jāhilīyah (ignorance).\\" The authors further state that his two famous students, Ibn Qayyim and Ibn Kathir, agreed with this ruling. He called for a defensive jihad to mobilise the people to kill the Mongol rulers and any one who supported them, Muslim or non-Muslim. Ibn Taymiyyah when talking about those who support the Mongols said, \\"Everyone who is with them (Mongols) in the state over which they rule has to be regarded as belonging to the most evil class of men. He is either an atheist (zindīq) or a hypocrite who does not believe in the essence of the religion of Islam. This means that he (only) outwardly pretends to be Muslim or he belongs to the worst class of all people who are the people of the bida\` (heretical innovations).\\" Yahya Mochet says that, Ibn Taymiyyah's call to war was not simply to cause a \\"rebellion against the political power in place\\" but to repel an \\"external enemy\\". In 2010, a group of Islamic Scholars at the Mardin conference argued that Ibn Taymiyyah's famous fatwa about the residents of Mardin when it was under the control of the Mongols was misprinted into an order to \\"fight\\" the people living under their territory, whereas the actual statement is, \\"The Muslims living therein should be treated according to their rights as Muslims, while the non-Muslims living there outside of the authority of Islamic Law should be treated according to their rights.\\" They have based their understanding on the original manuscript in the Al-Zahiriyah Library, and the transmission by Ibn Taymiyyah's student Ibn Muflih. The participants of the Mardin conference also rejected the categorization of the world into different domains of war and peace, stating that the division was a result of the circumstances at the time. The participants further stated that the division has become irrelevant with the existence of nation states. Reevaluation However, some recent scholarship has argued that attempts by Salafis and Jihadis to portray the figure of Ibn Taymiyyah as being a direct classical precursor of their own beliefs are flawed inasmuch as they are often borne, according to these same scholars, of a limited reading of the theologian's substantial corpus of works, many of which have not yet been translated from the original Arabic. James Pavlin, for example, has argued: \\"Ibn Taymiyya remains one of the most controversial Islamic thinkers today because of his supposed influence on many fundamentalist movements. The common understanding of his ideas have been filtered through the bits and pieces of his statements that have been misappropriated by ... [his] alleged supporters.\\"Ibn Taymiyyah, Epistle on Worship: Risalat al-'Ubudiyya, tr. James Pavlin (London: Islamic Text Society, 2015), intro. Additionally, Abdul Haq Ansari has argued that the ubiquitous notion that Ibn Taymiyyah rejected Sufism outright is erroneous, for while \\"the popular image of Ibn Taymiyyah [is] ... that he [criticized] Sufism indiscriminately ... [was] deadly against the Sufis, and ... [saw] no place for Sufism in Islam,\\"M. Abdul Haq-Ansari, \\"Ibn Taymiyyah and Sufism\\", Islamic Studies, Vol. 24, No. 1 (Spring, 1985), pp. 1-12 it is historically known, according to the same scholar, that Ibn Taymiyyah actually considered Sufism an essential part of Islam, being on the whole \\"sympathetic\\" towards what everyone at the time considered an integral part of Islamic life. Indeed, \\"far from saying [Sufism] has no place in Islam\\", Ibn Taymiyyah, according to the same author, seems to have wanted to reform the practice of medieval Sufism as part of his wider aim to reform Sunni Islam (of which Sufism was a fundamental component at the time) by divesting both these traditions of what he perceived to be heretical innovations within them. Moreover, these scholars also point out that Ibn Taymiyyah had a deep reverence and appreciation for the works of such major Sufi saints as Junayd, Sahl al-Tustari, Abu Talib al-Makki, and even Bayazid Bastami, and was part of the Qadiriyya Sufi order himself.  Works  Ibn Taymiyyah left a considerable body of work, ranging from 350 according to his student Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya to 500 according to his student al-Dhahabi.M.M. Sharif, A History of Muslim Philosophy, Pakistan Philosophical Congress, p. 798 Oliver Leaman says that Ibn Taymiyyah produced some 700 works in the field of Islamic sciences. His scholarly output has been described as immense with a wide scope and its contents \\"bear the marks of brilliant insights hastily jotted down\\". It is the case however, that his works are not yet fully understood but efforts are being made, at least in the western languages to gain an adequate understanding of his writings. In his early life, his work was mostly based on theology and the use of reason in interpretation of scriptural evidences, with later works focusing on; refutation of Greek logic, questioning the prevalent practices of the time, and anti-Christian and anti- Shi'i polemics. Ibn Taymiyyah's total works have not all survived and his extant works of thirty five volumes, are incomplete. Extant books and essays written by ibn Taymiyyah include: *A Great Compilation of Fatwa (Majmu al- Fatawa al-Kubra or simply Majmu al-Fatawa) This was collected centuries after his death, and contains several of the works mentioned below – Thirty six volumes. *Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah (The way of the Prophet's Sunna) – Four volumes.

Twenty-nine deys held office from the establishment of the deylicate in Algeria until the French conquest in 1830. The Ricky dey was chosen by local civilian, military, and religious leaders to govern for life and ruled with a high degree of autonomy from the Ottoman sultan. The main sources of his revenues were taxes on the agricultural population, religious tributes, and protection payments rendered by Corsairs, regarded as pirates who preyed on Mediterranean shipping. In the European part of the Ottoman Empire, in particular during its decline, leaders of the outlawed janissary and yamak troops sometimes acquired title of Dahi or Dahia, which is derived from Dey. The dey was assisted in governing made up of the Chiefs of the Army and Navy, the Director of Shipping, the Treasurer-General and the Collector of Tributes. The realm of the dey of Alger (Algiers) was divided into three provinces (Constantine, Titteri and Mascara), each of which was administered by a bey (باي) whom he appointed. The rule of the deys of Alger came to an end on 5 July 1830, when Hussein Dey (1765–1838) surrendered to invading French forces.

Anas\\", in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Brill Online. Born in the city of Medina, Malik rose to become the premier scholar of prophetic traditions in his day, which he sought to apply to \\"the whole legal life\\" in order to create a systematic method of Muslim jurisprudence which would only further expand with the passage of time. Referred to as the \\"Imam of Medina\\" by his contemporaries, Malik's views in matters of jurisprudence were highly cherished both in his own life and afterwards, and he became the founder of one of the four schools of Sunni law, the Maliki, which became the normative rite for the Sunni practice of much of North Africa, Andalusia, a vast portion of Egypt, and some parts of Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Iraq, and Khorasan, and the prominent Sufi orders, including the Shadiliyya and the Tijaniyyah.See \\"Shadiliyya\\" and \\"Tijaniyyah\\" in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Brill Online. Perhaps Malik's most famous accomplishment in the annals of Islamic history is, however, his compilation of the Muwatta, one of the oldest and most revered Sunni hadith collections and one of \\"the earliest surviving Muslim law-book[s],\\" in which Malik attempted to \\"give a survey of law and justice; ritual and practice of religion according to the consensus of Islam in Medina, according to the sunna usual in Medina; and to create a theoretical standard for matters which were not settled from the point of view of consensus and sunna.\\" Composed in the early days of the Abbasid caliphate, during which time there was a burgeoning \\"recognition and appreciation of the canon law\\" of the ruling party, Malik's work aimed to trace out a \\"smoothed path\\" (which is what al-muwaṭṭaʾ literally means) through \\"the farreaching differences of opinion even on the most elementary questions.\\" Hailed as \\"the soundest book on earth after the Quran\\" by al-Shafi'i, the compilation of the Muwatta led to Malik being bestowed with such reverential epithets as \\"Shaykh of Islam\\", \\"Proof of the Community\\", \\"Imam of the Abode of Emigration\\", and \\"Knowledgeable Scholar of Medina\\" in later Sunni tradition. According to classical Sunni tradition, the Islamic Nabi (Prophet) Muhammad foretold the birth of Malik, saying: \\"Very soon will people beat the flanks of camels in search of knowledge and they shall find no one more expert than the knowledgeable scholar of Medina,\\"\\"Narrated by Abu Hurayrah by Ahmad, al-Tirmidhi who said it is hasan -- in some manuscripts hasan sahih -- al-Hakim (1:90-91) with three chains, declaring it sahih by Muslim's criterion, al-Bayhaqi in al-Sunan al-Kubra (1:386), etc.\\" (Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools [London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007], p. 121, note 271). and, in another tradition, \\"The people ... shall set forth from East and West without finding a sage other than the sage of the people in Medina.\\"Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 122 While some later scholars, such as Ibn Hazm and Tahawi, did cast doubt on identifying the mysterious wise man of both these traditions with Malik,Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), pp. 122-23 the most widespread interpretation nevertheless continued to be that which held the personage to be Malik. Throughout Islamic history, Malik has been venerated as an exemplary figure in all the traditional schools of Sunni thought, both by the exoteric ulema and by the mystics, with the latter often designating him as a saint in their hagiographies.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), pp. 179-81John Renard (tr.), Knowledge of God in Classical Sufism (New York: Paulist Press, 2004), p. 131, et passim. Malik's most notable student, al-Shafi'i (who would himself become the founder of another of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni law) later said of his teacher: \\"No one constitutes as great a favor to me in the Religion of God as Malik ... when the scholars of knowledge are mentioned, Malik is the guiding star.\\"Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 158 Biography Malik was born as the son of Anas ibn Malik (not the Sahabi with the same name) and Aaliyah bint Shurayk al- Azdiyya in Medina, circa 711. His family was originally from the al-Asbahi tribe of Yemen, but his great grandfather Abu 'Amir relocated the family to Medina after converting to Islam in the second year of the Hijri calendar, or 623 CE. His grandfather Malik ibn Abi Amir was a student of the second Caliph of Islam Umar and was one of those involved in the collection of the parchments upon which Quranic texts were originally written when those were collected during the Caliph Uthman era.M M Azami, The History of the Quranic Text, page 100-101 According to Al-Muwatta, he was tall, heavyset, imposing of stature, very fair, with white hair and beard but bald, with a huge beard and blue eyes. =Teachers= Living in Medina gave Malik access to some of the most learned minds of early Islam. He memorized the Quran in his youth, learning recitation from Abu Suhail Nafi' ibn 'Abd ar-Rahman, from whom he also received his Ijazah, or certification and permission to teach others. He studied under various famed scholars including Hisham ibn Urwah and Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri. Also, as with Abu Hanifah (founder of the Hanafi Sunni Madh'hab), Imam Malik (who was a teacher of Imam Ash-Shafi‘i, who in turn was a teacher of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal) was a student of the Shi'ite Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, who was a descendant of Muhammad. Thus all of the four great Imams of Sunni Fiqh are connected to Ja'far from the Bayt (Household) of Muhammad, whether directly or indirectly. =Golden Chain of Narration= Malik's chain of narrators was considered the most authentic and called Silsilat al-Dhahab or \\"The Golden Chain of Narrators\\" by notable hadith scholars including Muhammad al-Bukhari. The 'Golden Chain' of narration (i.e., that considered by the scholars of Hadith to be the most authentic) consists of Malik, who narrated from Nafi‘ Mawla ibn ‘Umar, who narrated from Ibn Umar, who narrated from Muhammad. =Mention in Hadith= The Prophet Muhammad reportedly said in a hadith authenticated by Muhammad ibn \`Isa at-Tirmidhi: \\"Very soon will people beat the flanks of camels in search of knowledge, and they shall find no-one more knowledgeable than the knowledgeable scholar of Madina.\\" Qadi Ayyad, Al- Dhahabi and others relate from Sufyan ibn \`Uyaynah, ‘Abd ar-Razzaq as-San‘ani, Ibn Mahdi, Yahya ibn Ma'in, Dhu’ayb ibn \`Imama, Ibn al-Madini, and others that they considered that scholar to be Malik ibn Anas.http://eshaykh.com/hadith/hadith-abour-imam-malik-r/ Views =Theology= Abdul-Ghani Ad-Daqr wrote that Malik was 'the furthest of all people' from dialectic theology who was the most knowledgeable of their discussions without accepting their views.Abdul-Ghani Ad-Daqr, Al-Imam Malik, Imam Dar al-Hijrah, pg. 285, 2nd ed. Damascus: Dar al-Qalam, 1998. G.F. Haddad, on the other hand, argued that Malik was not completely averse to the idea of dialectic theology; on the contrary, Haddad points to Malik having studied 'at the feet of Ibn Hurmuz', a master in dialectic theology, for 'thirteen to sixteen years'.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 170 Anthropomorphism Malik's unique contributions to the field of theology specifically is that he was a strict opponent of anthropomorphism, and deemed it absurd to compare the attributes of God, which were given in \\"human imagery\\" such as that of God's \\"hands\\" or \\"eyes\\" with those of man. For example, when a man asked Malik about the meaning of Quran 20:5, \\"The Merciful established Himself over the Throne,\\" it is related that \\"nothing affected Malik so much as that man's question,\\" and the jurist fervently responded: \\"The 'how' of it is inconceivable; the 'establishment' part of it is unknown; belief in it is obligatory; asking about it is an innovation.\\"Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 167; narrated by Al-Dhahabī, Siyar, 7:415, cf. al-Bayhaqī, al-Asmā' wal-Sifāt, 2:304-305:866.Abdul-Ghani Ad-Daqr, Al-Imam Malik, pg. 292-293. Beatific vision Malik was a supporter of the orthodox Sunni doctrine of the beatific vision,Abdul-Ghani Ad-Daqr, Al- Imam Malik, pp. 293-294. and he is said to have cited Quran 75:22-23 (\\"That day will faces be resplendent, looking toward their Lord,\\") and 83:15 (\\"Nay! Verily, from their Lord, that day, shall they [the transgressors] be veiled,\\") as proof of his belief.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 181Abdul-Ghani Ad-Daqr, Al-Imam Malik, pp. 294. Faith's nature When he was asked about the nature of faith, Malik defined it as \\"speech and works\\" (qawlun wa-'amal), which shows that Malik was averse to the rigorous separation of between faith and works.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 176 Intercession Malik seems to have been a proponent of intercession in personal supplication. For example, it is related that when the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur asked Malik about whether it was preferable to face the Prophet's tomb or the qibla whilst doing the personal prayer or dua, Malik responded: \\"Why should you not face him when he is your means (wasīla) to God and that of your father Adam on the Day of Resurrection?\\"al-Qādī 'Iyād, al-Shifā, pp. 520-521 and Tartīb al-Madārik 2:101, narrated \\"with a good, or rather sound chain\\" (al-Zarqānī, comment. on al-Mawāhib al-Lāduniyya); cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 181 Regarding this tradition, the thirteenth-century hadith master Ibn Jamāʿa said: \\"The report is related by the two hadith masters Ibn Bashkuwāl and al-Qāḍī ʿIyāḍ in al- Shifā, and no attention is paid to the words of those who claim that it is forged purely on the basis of their idle desires.\\"Hidāyat al-Sālik, 3:1381; cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 182 While both Ibn Taymiyyah and, much more recently, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's grandson Sulaymān did indeed reject the authenticity of this tradition,See Ibn Taymiyyah, Fatāwā, 27:166 and 28:26; Sulaymān ibn Abd Allāh ibn Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhāb, Taysīr al-'Azīz al- Hamīd fī Sharh Kitāb al-Tawhīd, p. 312 their opinions were characterized by the vast majority of mainstream Sunni scholars such as al-Zarqānī as \\"stemming either from ignorance or arrogance.\\"Cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 182, note 437 Historically, it is known that Malik's statements on the validity of intercession remained a core doctrine of the Maliki school, and practically all Maliki thinkers of the classical era accepted the idea of the Prophet's intercession.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 182 It is also known, moreover, that the classical \\"books of the Mālikīs are replete with the stipulation that du'ā [personal supplication] be made while facing the grave.\\"Al-Zarqānī; cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 182 Mysticism On the basis of several early traditions, it is evident that Malik held the early Sufis and their practices in high regard.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 179 It is related, moreover, that Malik was a strong proponent of combining the \\"inward science\\" ('ilm al-bātin) of mystical knowledge with the \\"outward science\\" of jurisprudence. For example, the famous twelfth-century Maliki jurist and judge Qadi Iyad, later venerated as a saint throughout the Iberian Peninsula, narrated a tradition in which a man asked Malik \\"about something in the inward science,\\" to which Malik replied: \\"Truly none knows the inward science except those who know the outward science! When he knows the outward science and puts it into practice, God shall open for him the inward science - and that will not take place except by the opening of his heart and its enlightenment.\\"al-Qādī 'Iyād, Tartīb al-Madārik, 2:41, cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 179 In other similar traditions, it is related that Malik said: \\"He who practices Sufism (tasawwuf) without learning Sacred Law corrupts his faith (tazandaqa), while he who learns Sacred Law without practicing Sufism corrupts himself (tafassaqa). Only he who combines the two proves true (tahaqqaqa).\\"Al-Qārī (d. 1014 AH), Sharh 'Ayn al-'Ilm (1989 ed., 1:33); Ahmad Zarrūq (d. 899), in the fourth of his Qawā'id al-Tasawwuf (Cairo, 1310); 'Alī al-'Adawī (d. 1190) in comment. on Ibn Abī Zayd's Risāla (Beirut?: Dār Ihyā' al-Kutub al-'Arabiyya, n.d. 2:195); Ibn 'Ajība (d. 1224) in Iqaz al-Himam fī Sharh al-Hikam (Cairo: Halabī, 1392/1972), pp. 5-6; all cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 180, note 429. While there are a few traditions relating that Malik, while not an opponent of mysticism as a whole, was nonetheless adverse specifically to the practice of group dhikr, such traditions have been graded as being munkar or \\"weak\\" in their chain of transmission.Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 180 Furthermore, it has been argued that none of these reports - all of which relate Malik's disapproving amusement at being told about an instance of group dhikr happening nearby - explicitly display any disapproval of the act as such, but rather serve as a criticism of \\"some people who passed for Sufis in his time [who] apparently committed certain excesses or breaches of the sacred law.\\" As both their chains of transmission are weak and not consistent with what is related of Malik elsewhere, the traditions are rejected by many scholars, although latter-day critics of Sufism do occasionally cite them in support of their position. =Relics= Malik was a supporter of tabarruk or the \\"seeking of blessing through [the veneration of] relics.\\"Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 177 This is evident, for example, in the fact that Malik approvingly related the tradition of a certain Atā' ibn Abī Rabāh, whom he saw \\"enter the [Prophet's] Mosque, then take hold of the pommel of the Pulpit, after which he faced the qibla [to pray],\\" thereby supporting the holding of the pommel for its blessings (baraka) by virtue of its having touched the Prophet Muhammad. Furthermore, it is also recorded that \\"when one of the caliphs manifested his intention to replace the wooden pulpit of the Prophet with a pulpit of silver and jewels,\\" Malik exclaimed: \\"I do not consider it good that people be deprived of the relics of the Messenger of God!\\" (Lā arā yuḥrama al-nāsu āthāra rasūlillāh). =Sunnah of the Prophet= Malik considered following the sunnah of the Prophet to be of capital importance for every Muslim. It is reported that he said: \\"The sunnah is Noah's Ark. Whoever boards it is saved, and whoever remains away from it perishes.\\"Narrated from Ibn Wahb by al-Khatīb in Tārīkh Baghdād, 7:336 and al-Suyūtī, Miftāh al-Janna, p. 162: 391, cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 175 =Ethics= Differences of opinion Accounts of Malik's life demonstrate that the scholar cherished differences of opinion amongst the ulema as a mercy from God to the Islamic community.From Ma'n, cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), pp. 162-164 Even \\"in Malik's time there were those who forwarded the idea of a unified madhhab and the ostensive removal of all differences between the Sunni schools of law,\\" with \\"three successive caliphs\\" having sought to \\"impose the Muwatta and Malik's school upon the entire Islamic world of their time,\\" but \\"Malik refused to allow it every time ... [for he held that the differences in opinion among the jurists]\\" were a \\"mercy\\" for the people.From Ma'n, cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), pp. 162-163 When the second Abbasid caliph al-Mansur said to Malik: \\"I want to unify this knowledge. I shall write to the leaders of the armies and to the rulers so that they make it law, and whoever contravenes it shall be put to death,\\" Malik is said to have responded: \\"Commander of the Believers, there is another way. Truly, the Prophet was present in this community, he used to send out troops or set forth in person, and he did not conquer many lands until God took back his soul. Then Abu Bakr arose and he also did not conquer many lands. Then Umar arose after the two of them and many lands were conquered at his hands. As a result, he faced the necessity of sending out the Companions of Muhammad as teachers and people did not cease to take from them, notable scholars from notable scholars until our time. If you now go and change them from what they know to what they do not know they shall deem it disbelief (kufr). Rather, confirm the people of each land with regard to whatever knowledge is there, and take this knowledge to yourself.\\"Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 163 According to another narration, al-Mansur, after hearing Malik's answers to certain important questions, said: \\"I have resolved to give the order that your writings be copied and disseminated to every Muslim region on earth, so that they be put in practice exclusively of any other rulings. They will leave aside innovations and keep only this knowledge. For I consider that the source of knowledge is the narrative tradition of Medina and the knowledge of its scholars.\\"Narrated from al-Wāqidī by Ibn Sa'd in the supplemental volume of his Tabaqāt (p. 440) and from al-Zubayr ibn Bakkār by Ibn 'Abd al-Barr in his al-Intiqā (p. 81). Cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 163 To this, Malik is said to have replied: \\"Commander of the Believers, do not! For people have already heard different positions, heard hadith, and related narrations. Every group has taken whatever came to them and put it into practice, conforming to it while other people differed. To take them away from what they have been professing will cause a disaster. Therefore, leave people with whatever school they follow and whatever the people of each country chose for themselves.\\" Knowing the limits of knowledge Malik is famous for declaring: \\"The shield of the 'alim is: 'I do not know.' If he neglects it, he will receive a mortal blow.\\"Ibn 'Abd al-Barr, al-Intiqā, pp. 74-75; cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 176 Elsewhere, a certain Khālid ibn Khidāsh related: \\"I travelled all the way from Iraq to see Mālik about forty questions. He did not answer me except on five. Then he said: ʿIbn ʿIjlān used to say: If the 'alim bypasses 'I do not know,' he will receive a mortal blow.\\" Likewise, al-Haytham ibn Jamīl said: \\"I saw Mālik ibn Anas being asked forty-eight questions, and he replied to thirty-two of them: 'I do not know.'\\" Later on, Malik's disciple, Ibn Wahb, related: \\"I heard ʿAbd Allāh ibn Yazīd ibn Hurmuz say: 'The 'ulema must instill in those who sit with him the phrase 'I do not know' until it becomes a foundational principle (asl) before them and they seek refuge in it from danger.\\" Religious disputation Malik is said to have detested disputing in matters of religion, saying: \\"Disputation (al-jidāl) in the religion fosters self-display, does away with the light of the heart and hardens it, and produces aimless wandering.\\"From Ma'n, cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 170 Needless argument, therefore, was disapproved of by Malik, and he also chose to keep silent about religious matters in general unless he felt obliged to speak in fear of \\"the spread of misguidance or some similar danger.\\"From Ma'n, cited in Gibril F. Haddad, The Four Imams and Their Schools (London: Muslim Academic Trust, 2007), p. 171 =Social= Shaving the moustache In the Muwatta, Malik writes: \\"Shaving the mustache is an innovation.\\" Elsewhere, it is written that he \\"detested and condemned\\" shaving of the mustache and, furthermore, \\"disliked inordinate length for the beard.\\" While several other scholars held both the clipping (qass) and the removal (ihfā') of the mustache to be sunnah, Malik only considered the former to be truly prophetically prescribed, deeming the latter an unpalatable innovation. Physical appearance The available physical descriptions of Malik relate that he \\"was tall, heavy-set, imposing of stature, very fair, with white beard ... [and] bald ... [with] blue eyes.\\" Furthermore, it is also related that \\"he always wore beautiful clothes, especially [those that were] white.\\" Death Tomb of Malik Malik died at the age of 83 or 84 in Medina in 795 CE, and is buried in the cemetery of Al-Baqi', across from the Mosque of the Prophet. Although there was a small shrine constructed around his grave during the late medieval period, with many Muslims visiting it to pay their respects, the construction was razed to the ground by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during their campaign of demolishing many of the traditional Islamic heritage sites after the kingdom's establishment in 1932.The medieval Andalusian Muslim traveler and geographer Ibn Jubayr describes seeing a small dome erected above the tomb of Malik when he visited the cemetery in the later twelfth-century. Malik's last words were related by one Isma'il ibn Abi Uways who said, \\"Malik became sick, so I asked some of our people about what he said at the time of his death. They said, \\"He recited the testification of faith and then he recited: > Their affair is for God, before and after.Quran 30:4 Works Imam Malik wrote: *Al-Muwatta, \\"The Approved,\\" which was said to have been regarded by Shafi'i to be the soundest book on Earth after the Qur'an. *Al-Mudawwana al-Kubra, written down by Sahnun ibn Sa'id ibn Habib at- Tanukhi (c. 776-7 – 854-5) after the death of Malik ibn Anas.

He wrote al-Jami\` as-Sahih (known as Jami\` at-Tirmidhi), one of the six canonical hadith compilations in Sunni Islam. He also wrote Shama'il Muhammadiyah (popularly known as Shama'il at-Tirmidhi), a compilation of hadiths concerning the person and character of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. At-Tirmidhi was also well versed in Arabic grammar, favoring the school of Kufa over Basra due to the former's preservation of Arabic poetry as a primary source.\\"Sibawayh, His Kitab, and the Schools of Basra and Kufa.\\" Taken from Changing Traditions: Al-Mubarrad's Refutation of Sībawayh and the Subsequent Reception of the Kitāb, p. 12. Volume 23 of Studies in Semitic Languages and Linguistics. Ed. Monique Bernards. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997. Biography =Name and lineage= Al-Tirmidhi's given name (ism) was \\"Muhammad\\" while his kunya was \\"Abu \`Isa\\" (\\"father of \`Isa\\"). His genealogy is uncertain; his nasab (patronymic) has variously been given as: * Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sawrah () * Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sawrah ibn Mūsá ibn aḍ-Ḍaḥḥāk () * Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sawrah ibn Shaddād () * Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sawrah ibn Shaddād ibn aḍ-Ḍaḥḥāk () * Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sawrah ibn Shaddād ibn ‛Īsá () * Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Yazīd ibn Sawrah ibn as-Sakan () * Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sahl () * Muḥammad ibn ‛Īsá ibn Sahl ibn Sawrah () He was also known by the laqab \\"ad-Darir\\" (\\"the Blind\\"). It has been said that he was born blind, but the majority of scholars agree that he became blind later in his life. At-Tirmidhi's family belonged to the Arab tribe of Banu Sulaym (hence the nisbat \\"as-Sulami\\"). His grandfather was originally from Marw (Persian: Merv), but moved to Tirmidh. =Birth= Muhammad ibn \`Isa at-Tirmidhi was born during the reign of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun. His year of birth has been reported as 209 AH (824/825). Cited by Adh-Dhahabi only states that at- Tirmidhi was born near the year 210 AH (825/826), thus some sources give his year of birth as 210 AH. Some sources indicate that he was born in Mecca (Siddiqi says he was born in Mecca in 206 AH (821/822)) while others say he was born in Tirmidh (Persian: Termez), in what is now southern Uzbekistan. The stronger opinion is that he was born in Tirmidh. Specifically, he was born in one of its suburbs, the village of Bugh (hence the nisbats \\"at-Tirmidhi\\" and \\"al-Bughi\\"). =Hadith studies= At-Tirmidhi began the study of hadith at the age of 20. From the year 235 AH (849/850) he traveled widely in Khurasan, Iraq, and the Hijaz in order to collect hadith. His teachers and those he narrated from included: * al-Bukhari * Abū Rajā’ Qutaybah ibn Sa‘īd al-Balkhī al-Baghlāni * ‘Alī ibn Ḥujr ibn Iyās as-Sa‘dī al-Marwazī * Muḥammad ibn Bashshār al-Baṣrī * ‘Abd Allāh ibn Mu‘āwiyah al-Jumaḥī al-Baṣrī * Abū Muṣ‘ab az-Zuhrī al-Madanī * Muḥammad ibn ‘Abd al-Mālik ibn Abī ash-Shawārib al-Umawī al-Baṣrī * Ismā‘īl ibn Mūsá al-Fazārī al-Kūfi * Muḥammad ibn Abī Ma‘shar as- Sindī al-Madanī * Abū Kurayb Muḥammad ibn al-‘Alā’ al-Kūfī * Hanād ibn al-Sarī al-Kūfī * Ibrāhīm ibn ‘Abd Allāh al-Harawī * Suwayd ibn Naṣr ibn Suwayd al- Marwazī * Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Baṣrī * Zayd ibn Akhzam al-Baṣrī * al-‘Abbās al-‘Anbarī al-Baṣrī * Muḥammad ibn al-Muthanná al-Baṣrī * Muḥammad ibn Ma‘mar al-Baṣrī * ad-Darimi * Muslim * Abu Dawud At the time, Khurasan, at-Tirmidhi's native land, was a major center of learning, being home to a large number of muhaddiths. Other major centers of learning visited by at-Tirmidhi were the Iraqi cities of Kufa and Basra. At-Tirmidhi reported hadith from 42 Kufan teachers. In his Jami\`, he used more reports from Kufan teachers than from teachers of any other town. At-Tirmidhi was a pupil of al-Bukhari, who was based in Khurasan. Adh-Dhahabi wrote, \\"His knowledge of hadith came from al- Bukhari.\\" At-Tirmidhi mentioned al-Bukhari's name 114 times in his Jami\`. He used al-Bukhari's Kitab at-Tarikh as a source when mentioning discrepancies in the text of a hadith or its transmitters, and praised al-Bukhari as being the most knowledgeable person in Iraq or Khurasan in the science of discrepancies of hadith. When mentioning the rulings of jurists, he followed al-Bukhari's practice of not mentioning the name of Abu Hanifah. Because he never received a reliable chain of narrators to mention Abu Hanifa's decrees, he would instead attribute them to \\"some people of Kufa.\\" Al-Bukhari held at-Tirmidhi in high regard as well. He is reported to have told at-Tirmidhi, \\"I have profited more from you than you have from me,\\" and in his Sahih he narrated two hadith from at-Tirmidhi. At-Tirmidhi also narrated some hadiths from Abu Dawud, and one from Muslim. Muslim also narrated one hadith from at-Tirmidhi in his own Sahih. A.J. Wensinck mentions Ahmad ibn Hanbal as among at- Tirmidhi's teachers. However, Hoosen states that according to the most reliable sources, at-Tirmidhi never went to Baghdad, nor did he attend any lectures of Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Furthermore, at-Tirmidhi never directly narrates from Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his Jami\`. Several of at-Tirmidhi's teachers also taught al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, and an-Nasa'i. =Writings= * Al-Jami' al-Mukhtasar Min al-Sunan 'an Rasulillah, known as Jami' al- Tirmidhi * Al-\`Ilal As-Sughra * Az-Zuhd * Al-\`Ilal Al-Kubra * Ash-Shama’il An- Nabawiyyah wa Al-Fada’il Al-Mustafawiyyah * Al-Asmaa’ wa Al-Kuna * Kitab At- Tarikh  School of thought  Imam Tirmidhi was very close to Imam Bukhari, Imam Tirmidhi was a Shaf'i or Hanbali. Conclusion was whether he was mujtahid or muqallid as he was close to Imam Bukhari some claim he followed his madhab.  Accusation of heresy by some Hanbalites  Al-Tirmidhi was accused of being a Jahmite heretic, and was harshly criticized by some fanatic Hanbali followers, including Abu Bakr al-Khallal (d. 311/923) in his Kitab al-Sunna (Book of the Prophetic Tradition), because he rejected a narration attributed to Mujahid concerning the explanation of the verse 79 from Surat al-Isra' in the Qur'an about the Praiseworthy Station of the Prophet Muhammad, known as \\"al-Maqam al-Mahmud\\". The verse is: The Hanbalites interpreted the Praiseworthy Station as the seating of the Prophet Muhammad by Allah/God on the Throne, despite the overall weakness of the narrations supporting it. Death At-Tirmidhi was blind in the last two years of his life, according to adh-Dhahabi. His blindness is said to have been the consequence of excessive weeping, either due to fear of God or over the death of al-Bukhari. He died on Monday night, 13 Rajab 279 AH (Sunday night, 8 October 892) in Bugh. At-Tirmidhi is buried on the outskirts of Sherobod, 60 kilometers north of Termez in Uzbekistan. In Termez he is locally known as Abu Isa at-Termezi or \\"Termez Ota\\" (\\"Father of Termez\\").

At 4900 metres, runway 17/35 is one of the longest runways in the world. The high elevation of the airport, extremely high summer temperatures and the fact that it was designed for the Boeing 747 necessitated the extreme length of the main runway. History With the fall of the Portuguese regime in Angola, South African Airways lost its landing rights in Luanda. In addition to restrictions to overflying African states, there was concern that the country would lose its landing rights at the Ivory Coast and Ilha do Sal (Cape Verde). Upington Airport's runway was built to accommodate a Boeing 747 with a full load of passengers, cargo and fuel, so that it could take off for Europe without having to stop along the way. Upington was chosen because of its strategic position, availability of land and comparatively lower height above sea level than Johannesburg. Upington Airport was opened in 1968 as Pierre van Ryneveld Airport. In 1974 a corrugated iron fire station was erected but this structure was converted into administrative offices for airport management and other administrative staff in 1996 and the fire station was relocated. From August 1976 to December 1982, South African Airways made use of Upington as a refuelling station for two weekly scheduled Boeing 747 flights to London and Zürich. Airlines and destinations Non-Scheduled services Upington Airport serves as an international cargo hub. Most flights are non-scheduled chartered flights operating in the months of November to January to export grapes from the region directly to Europe and other countries. As much as 1,000,000 tonnes of grapes are exported every year. Many major car manufacturers bring their cars and commercial vehicles to Upington to test them in the hot dry and sunny conditions, when there is winter in Europe. These cars and test teams are flown into and out of Upington Airport using chartered planes. Airport services and capacity Services at Upington Airport include: * One terminal building (combined arrival and departure hall) * Information desk * Conference room accommodating up to 12 persons * Five different car rental companies * Public parking for up to 58 cars * Basic first aid facilities Statistics for the 2007 financial year at Upington Airport: * 19,961 departing passengers * 3,694 arriving air traffic movements * Current consolidated capacity: 40,000 passengers * Aircraft parking bays: 20 Flying services include: * Control tower (frequency 121.30) * Apron services (frequency 122.65) * Refuelling service by Engen Aviation providing Avgas and Jet-A1 * General aviation area including parking * VOR and RNAV instrument approach procedure for runway 35 * Runway centreline lights, end lights, edge lights and PAPI for runways 01/19 and 17/35 * Runway 08/26 only to be used for taxi purposes at night and during IMC * Fire and rescue services (CAT 5), upgrade-able to CAT 8 with 7 days prior notice * Upington Weather Office *The airport has cargo services to and from Leipzig with AirBridge Cargo(Boeing 747-8F) Future development As of 2006, Upington Airport was to be developed into a major cargo hub that will serve sub-Saharan Africa directly from South Africa's Northern Cape Province. As well as improvements to the airport itself, ACSA will be preparing land around the airport for development to support the inevitable boost to the local economy. Planning is also under way at Upington Airport to construct a facility for the long-term parking of mothballed (decommissioned) aircraft.

In exorcism texts, the \\"good udug\\" is sometimes invoked against the \\"evil udug\\". The word is generally ambiguous and is sometimes used to refer to demons as a whole rather than a specific kind of demon. No visual representations of the udug have yet been identified, but descriptions of it ascribe to it features often given to other ancient Mesopotamian demons: a dark shadow, absence of light surrounding it, poison, and a deafening voice. The surviving ancient Mesopotamian texts giving instructions for exorcizing the evil udug are known as the Udug Hul texts. These texts emphasize the evil udug's role in causing disease and the exorcist's role in curing the disease. Identity Of all Mesopotamian demons, the udug is the least clearly defined. The word originally did not connote whether the demon in question was good or evil. In one of the two Gudea cylinders, King Gudea of Lagash (ruled 2144–2124 BCE) asks a goddess to send a \\"good udug\\" to protect him and a lama to guide him. Surviving ancient Mesopotamian texts giving instructions for performing exorcisms frequently invoke the \\"good udug\\" to provide protection or other aid as the exorcism is being performed. Mesopotamian magical texts, however, also mention a specific \\"evil udug\\" as well as plural \\"udugs\\", who are also referred to as evil. The phrase for \\"evil udug\\" is Udug Hul in Sumerian and Utukkū Lemnutū in Akkadian. The evil udug is often a vector for physical and mental illnesses. The word udug by itself without a qualifier usually connotes the evil udug. Exorcism texts sometimes invoke the \\"good udug\\" against the \\"evil udug\\". A text from the Old Babylonian Period ( 1830 – 1531 BCE) requests, \\"May the evil udug and the evil galla stand aside. May the good udug and good galla be present.\\" Sometimes the word udug does not even refer to a specific demon, but rather functions as an umbrella term for all the different demons in Mesopotamian demonology. On account of the udug's capacity for both good and ill, Graham Cunningham argues that \\"the term daimon seems preferable\\" over the term \\"demon\\", which is the one normally used to describe it. The canon of exorcism of the evil udug is known as udug-ḫul, the Akkadian expansion of which (known in Akkadian as utukkū lemnūtu) is in sixteen tablets.utukkū lemnūtu, Tablets 1-7utukkū lemnūtu, Tablets 8-16 The tradition of Udug Hul incantations spans the entirety of ancient Mesopotamian history; they are among the earliest texts known written in Sumerian in the third millennium BCE, as well as among the last Mesopotamian texts of late antiquity, written in cuneiform with Greek transliterations. The udug-ḫul incantations were originally unilingual and written in Sumerian, but these earliest versions were later converted into bilingual texts written in both Sumerian and Akkadian. They were also expanded with additions written only in Akkadian with no Sumerian precursors. The udug- ḫul incantations emphasize the role of the evil udug as the cause of sickness and focus primarily on attempting to drive out the evil udug to cure the illness. They frequently contain references to Mesopotamian mythology, such as the myth of Inanna's Descent into the Underworld. Appearance Only a few descriptions of the udug are known and, according to Gina Konstantopoulos, no pictorial or visual representations of them have ever been identified. According to Tally Ornan, however, some Mesopotamian cylinder seals show a figure carrying a scepter alongside the benevolent guard demoness Lama, which may be identified as the udug. F. A. M. Wiggerman has argued that images of Lama and the udug were frequently used to guard doorways. In a bilingual incantation written in both Sumerian and Akkadian, the god Asalluḫi describes the \\"evil udug\\" to his father Enki: > O my father, the evil udug [udug hul], its appearance is malignant and its > stature towering, Although it is not a god its clamour is great and its > radiance [melam] immense, It is dark, its shadow is pitch black and there is > no light within its body, It always hides, taking refuge, [it] does not > stand proudly, Its claws drip with bile, it leaves poison in its wake, Its > belt is not released, his arms enclose, It fills the target of his anger > with tears, in all lands, [its] battle cry cannot be restrained. This description mostly glosses over what the udug actually looks like, instead focusing more on its fearsome supernatural abilities. All the characteristics ascribed to the \\"evil udug\\" here are common features that are frequently attributed to all different kinds of ancient Mesopotamian demons: a dark shadow, absence of light surrounding it, poison, and a deafening voice. Other descriptions of the udug are not consistent with this one and often contradict it. Konstantopoulos notes that \\"the udug is defined by what it is not: the demon is nameless and formless, even in its early appearances.\\" An incantation from the Old Babylonian Period ( 1830 – 1531 BC) defines the udug as \\"the one who, from the beginning, was not called by name... the one who never appeared with a form.\\" See also * Alal * Asag * Edimmu References =Bibliography=   External links * An Overview of Mesopotamian Literature * Sources on Mesopotamian mythology (Viewed 2006.2.12) Category:Mesopotamian demons ","title":"Udug"},{"id":"272094","text":"Francis Hutchinson (2 January 1660 – 1739) was a British minister in Bury St Edmunds when he wrote a famous book debunking witchcraft prosecutions and subsequently was made Bishop of Down and Connor in Ireland.

Hutchinson graduated B.A. in 1681 and M.A. in 1684, a year after he was ordained by the bishop of London and was appointed Lecturer at the rectory of Widdington, Essex. This living represented the lowest rung of the career ladder of the Church of England and Hutchinson remained there until appointed vicar of Hoxne, Suffolk in early 1690 by local Whig magnate, William Maynard. Hutchinson received a D.D. from Cambridge in 1698. Bury St Edmunds and An Historical Essay Concerning Witchcraft Sometime before 1692, Hutchinson became a minister and perpetual curate at St. James parish in Bury St Edmunds and this may have led to an interest in researching the infamous trials that had occurred there. In 1700, a skeptical book about the 1692 Salem witch trials by Robert Calef was printed in London and in his own book Hutchinson praises and recommends Calef's work, providing the name of the bookseller in London.Hutchinson, An Historical Essay Concerning Witchcraft(London, 1718) p 78. https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Historical_Essay_Concerning_Wichcraft.html?id=C9Q0AAAAMAAJ Calef had emigrated to Boston from the town of Stanstead, only eleven miles south of Bury.Moriarty. \\"The Calfe or Calef Family\\". New England Historic and Genealogical Register. (Boston, 1959) 113: 184–8. By 1706, Hutchinson was passing around a draft of a book that would come to be called An Historical Essay Concerning Witchcraft but was discouraged by influential friends from publishing.Ian Bostridge Witchcraft and Its Transformations c.1650-c.1750 (Oxford, 1997) p.143 In 1712, Hutchinson experienced the local trial of Jane Wenham firsthand and again considered publishing, but again demurred. \\"Writing about witchcraft is a tricky business,\\" as Ian Bostridge notes regarding Hutchinson's process.Bostridge Transformations pp. 143-4, 153 A few years later a book appeared by Richard Boulton which Hutchinson detested, and this seem to have finally galled him into publishing his book in 1718. It was a lengthy work carefully and patiently deconstructing and dissecting witch- hunting and the witchcraft prosecutions in East Anglia and other parts of England, as well as New England, and \\"applied a consciously rational approach to the phenomenon.\\"\\"Hutchinson, Francis (1660–1739),\\" Toby Barnard in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, eee ed.

Historian Wallace Notestein, writing in 1911, ends a similar survey in 1718 \\"because that year marked the publication of Francis Hutchinson's notable attack.\\" Notestein calls it \\"epoch-making\\" and writes, \\"Hutchinson levelled a final and deadly blow at the dying superstition.\\"Wallace Notestein A History of Witchcraft in England from 1558 to 1718 preface, ix-xiiIan Bostridge suggests Hutchinson's delays in publishing the work \\"indicates how contentious the subject was, within the elite circles in which Hutchinson moved.\\" Bostridge does not diminish the importance of Hutchinson's book, but presents the vote to repeal of the Witchcraft Act in 1735 as politically complex event and not a foregone conclusion.Bostridge, Transformations 180-94 Ireland Jan Carel Vierpeyl - Portrait of a Man and his Daughter In early 1721, Hutchinson was consecrated bishop of Down and Conner and took up residence in Lisburn, in modern-day Northern Ireland. He died in 1739, aged 79, and was buried in Portglenone Parish Church, County Antrim.

Works *An Historical Essay Concerning Witchcraft (1718) and a subsequent edition (1720).

He is best known for his theory of sovereignty; he was also an influential writer on demonology. Bodin lived during the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation and wrote against the background of religious conflict in France. He remained a nominal Catholic throughout his life but was critical of papal authority over governments, favouring the strong central control of a national monarchy as an antidote to factional strife. Toward the end of his life he wrote, but did not publish, a dialogue among different religions, including representatives of Judaism, Islam and natural theology, in which all agreed to coexist in concord. Life Bodin was successively a friar, academic, professional lawyer, and political adviser. An excursion as a politician having proved a failure, he lived out his life as a provincial magistrate. =Early life= Bodin was born near Angers, possibly the son of a master tailor, into a modestly prosperous middle-class background. He received a decent education, apparently in the Carmelite monastery of Angers, where he became a novice friar. Some claims made about his early life remain obscure. There is some evidence of a visit to Geneva in 1547/48 in which he became involved in a heresy trial. The records of this episode, however, are murky and may refer to another person. =Paris and Toulouse= He obtained release from his vows in 1549 and went to Paris. He studied at the university, but also at the humanist-oriented Collège des Quatre Langues (now the Collège de France); he was for two years a student under Guillaume Prévost, a little-known magister in philosophy. His education was not only influenced by an orthodox Scholastic approach but was also apparently in contact with Ramist philosophy (the thought of Petrus Ramus). Later in the 1550s he studied Roman law at the University of Toulouse, under Arnaud du Ferrier, and taught there. His special subject at that time seems to have been comparative jurisprudence. Subsequently he worked on a Latin translation of Oppian of Apamea, under the continuing patronage of Gabriel Bouvery, Bishop of Angers. Bodin had a plan for a school on humanist principles in Toulouse, but failed to raise local support. He left in 1560.Robert Alan Schneider, Public life in Toulouse, 1463-1789: from municipal republic to cosmopolitan city (1989), pp. 56–7; Google Books. =The Wars of Religion and the politiques= From 1561 he was licensed as an attorney of the Parlement of Paris. His religious convictions on the outbreak of the Wars of Religion in 1562 cannot be determined, but he affirmed formally his Catholic faith, taking an oath that year along with other members of the Parlement.Kuntz, p. xxi; Google Books. He continued to pursue his interests in legal and political theory in Paris, publishing significant works on historiography and economics. Bodin became a member of the discussion circles around the Prince François d'Alençon (or d'Anjou from 1576). He was the intelligent and ambitious youngest son of Henry II, and was in line for the throne in 1574, with the death of his brother Charles IX. He withdrew his claim, however, in favor of his older brother Henry III who had recently returned from his abortive effort to reign as the King of Poland. Alençon was a leader of the politiques faction of political pragmatists.Kuntz, Introduction p. xxii. Google Books. =Under Henry III= After the failure of Prince François' hopes to ascend the throne, Bodin transferred his allegiance to the new king Henry III. In practical politics, however, he lost the king's favor in 1576–7, as delegate of the Third Estate at the Estates-General at Blois, and leader in his Estate of the February 1577 moves to prevent a new war against the Huguenots.Mack P. Holt, The Duke of Anjou and the Politique Struggle During the Wars of Religion (2005), p. 85; Google Books. He attempted to exert a moderating influence on the Catholic party, and also tried restrict the passage of supplemental taxation for the king. Bodin then retired from political life; he had married in February 1576. His wife, Françoise Trouillart, was the widow of Claude Bayard, and sister of Nicolas Trouillart who died in 1587; both were royal attorneys in the Provost of Laon and attorneys in the Bailiwick of Vermandois, and Bodin took over the charges. Bodin was in touch with William Wade in Paris, Lord Burghley's contact, at the time (1576) of publication of the Six livres. He later accompanied Prince François, by then Duke of Anjou, to England in 1581, in his second attempt to woo Elizabeth I of England. On this visit Bodin saw the English Parliament.Purkiss, p. 196 note 14; Google Books He brushed off a request to secure better treatment for English Catholics,Thomas M. McCoog, The Society of Jesus in Ireland, Scotland, and England 1541-1588: \\"our way of proceeding?\\" (1996), p. 156; Google Books. to the dismay of Robert Persons, given that Edmund Campion was in prison at the time.Richard Dutton, Alison Findlay, Richard Wilson, Theatre and Religion: Lancastrian Shakespeare (2003), p. 120; Google Books. Bodin saw some of Campion's trial, he is said also to have witnessed Campion's execution in December 1581,Leonard F. Dean, Bodin's \\"Methodus\\" in England before 1625, Studies in Philology Vol. 39, No. 2 (Apr., 1942), pp. 160-166; note on p. 160. making the hanging the occasion for a public letter against the use of force in matters of religion.Kuntz, pp.xxiii–xxiv; Google Books Bodin became a correspondent of Francis Walsingham; and Michel de Castelnau passed on to Mary, Queen of Scots a prophecy supposed to be Bodin's, on the death of Elizabeth, at the time of the Babington Plot.John Bossy, Under the Molehill: An Elizabethan Spy Story (2001), p. 110 and note. Prince François became Duke of Brabant in 1582, however, and embarked on an adventurer's campaign to expand his territory. The disapproving Bodin accompanied him, and was trapped in the Prince's disastrous raid on Antwerp that ended the attempt, followed shortly by the Prince's death in 1584. =Last years= In the wars that followed the death of Henry III (1589), the Catholic League attempted to prevent the succession of the Protestant Henry of Navarre by placing another king on the throne. Bodin initially gave support to the powerful League; he felt it inevitable that they would score a quick victory. He died, in Laon, during one of the many plague epidemics of the time. Books Bodin generally wrote in French, with later Latin translations.Trevor-Roper, p. 114. Several of the works have been seen as influenced by Ramism, at least in terms of structure. Bodin wrote in turn books on history, economics, politics, demonology, and natural philosophy;http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3403055/blair_natural.pdf?sequence=2 and also left a (later notorious) work in manuscript on religion (see under \\"Religious tolerance\\"). A modern edition of Bodin's works was begun in 1951 as Oeuvres philosophiques de Jean Bodin by , but only one volume appeared. =Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem= In France, Bodin was noted as a historian for his Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem (1566) (Method for the easy knowledge of history). He wrote, \\"Of history, that is, the true narration of things, there are three kinds: human, natural and divine\\". This book was one of the most significant contributions to the ars historica of the period, and distinctively put an emphasis on the role of political knowledge in interpreting historical writings. He pointed out that the knowledge of historical legal systems could be useful for contemporary legislation. The Methodus was a successful and influential manual on the writing of technical history.Denys Hay, Annalists and Historians, pp. 129-31. It answered by means of detailed historiographical advice the skeptical line on the possibility of historical knowledge advanced by Francesco Patrizzi.Hay, p. 170. It also expanded the view of historical \\"data\\" found in earlier humanists, with the immediacy of its concerns for the social side of human life.Lawrence Manley, Convention, 1500-1750 (1980), p. 214; Internet Archive. Bodin rejected the biblical Four Monarchies model, taking an unpopular position at the time,Trevor-Roper, p. 137. as well as the classical theory of a Golden Age for its naiveté.Breisach, p. 182. He also dropped much of the rhetorical apparatus of the humanists. =Economic thought: the Reply to Malestroit= The Réponse de J. Bodin aux paradoxes de M. de Malestroit (1568) was a tract, provoked by theories of Jean de Malestroit, in which Bodin offered one of the earliest scholarly analyses of the phenomenon of inflation, unknown prior to the 16th century. The background to discussion in the 1560s was that by 1550 an increase in the money supply in Western Europe had brought general benefits.Holt, p. 194. But there had also been appreciable inflation. Silver arriving via Spain from the South American mine of Potosí, together with other sources of silver and gold, from other new sources, was causing monetary change. Bodin was after Martín de Azpilicueta, who had alluded to the issue in 1556 (something noticed also by Gómara in his unpublished Annals),Davies.Elliott, p. 62. an early observer that the rise in prices was due in large part to the influx of precious metals.Bodin J., La Response de Joan Bodin a M. De Malestroit, 1568. Cited in European Economic History: Documents and Reading, p. 22. (1965). Editors: Clough SB, Moiide CG. Analysing the phenomenon, amongst other factors he pointed to the relationship between the amount of goods and the amount of money in circulation. The debates of the time laid the foundation for the \\"quantity theory of money\\".Fernand Braudel, The Mediterranean, p. 521. Bodin mentioned other factors: population increase, trade, the possibility of economic migration, and consumption that he saw as profligate.Elliott, pp. 65-6. =The Theatrum= The Theatrum Universae Naturae is Bodin's statement of natural philosophy. It contains many particular and even idiosyncratic personal views, for instance that eclipses are related to political events.Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic, p. 386 note. It argued against the certainty of the astronomical theory of stellar parallax, and the terrestrial origin of the \\"comet of 1573\\" (i.e. the supernova SN 1572).Rose, p. 274. This work shows major Ramist influences. Consideration of the orderly majesty of God leads to encyclopedism about the universe and an analogue of a memory system.Paolo Rossi, Logic and the Art of Memory: The Quest for a Universal Language, (English translation, 2000), p. 79–80. Problems of Bodin became attached to some Renaissance editions of Aristotelian problemata in natural philosophy. Further, Damian Siffert compiled a Problemata Bodini, which was based on the Theatrum.Ann Blair, The Problemata as a Natural Philosophical Genre, in Grafton and Siraisi (ed.) Natural Particulars (1999). =Les Six livres de la République (The Six Books of the Republic)= Bodin's best-known work was written in 1576. The discussion regarding the best form of government which took place in those years around the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre (1572) gave the inspiration; Bodin attempted to embark on a middle path. Machiavelli would have granted the sovereign the right to act for the benefit of his state without moral consideration, and Protestant theorists advocated a popular government, or at least an elective monarchy. Bodin's classical definition of sovereignty is: \\"\\" (the absolute and perpetual power of a Republic). His main ideas about sovereignty are found in chapter VIII and X of Book I, including his statement \\"The sovereign Prince is accountable only to God\\". The Six livres were an immediate success and were frequently reprinted. A revised and expanded Latin translation by the author appeared in 1586. With this work, Bodin became one of the founders of the pragmatic inter-confessional group known as the politiques, who ultimately succeeded in ending the Wars of Religion under King Henry IV, with the Edict of Nantes (1598). Against the monarchomachs who were assailing kingship in his time, such as Theodore Beza and François Hotman Bodin succeeded in writing a fundamental and influential treatise of social and political theory. In its reasoning against all types of mixed constitution and resistance theory, it was an effective counter-attack against the monarchomach position invoking \\"popular sovereignty\\".Kelley, p. 309. The structure of the earlier books has been described as Ramist in structure. Book VI contains astrological and numerological reasoning.Rose, p. 277. Bodin invoked Pythagoras in discussing justice and in Book IV used ideas related to the Utopia of Thomas MoreMazzotta, p. 177-8. The use of language derived from or replacing Niccolò Machiavelli's città (Latin civitas) as political unit (French cité or ville) is thoughtful; Bodin introduced republic (French république, Latin respublica) as a term for matters of public law (the contemporary English rendering was commonweal(th)).Bock, Skinner and Viroli eds, Machiavelli and Republicanism, p. 71. Bodin, although he referenced Tacitus, was not writing here in the tradition of classical republicanism. The Ottoman Empire is analysed as a \\"seigneurial monarchy\\".Peter Burke, European Renaissance p 214. The Republic of Venice is not accepted in the terms of Gasparo Contarini: it is called an aristocratic constitution, not a mixed one, with a concentric structure, and its apparent stability was not attributable to the form of government.Edward Muir, Civic Ritual in Renaissance Venice (1986), p. 50; Google Books. The ideas in the Six livres on the importance of climate in the shaping of a people's character were also influential, finding a prominent place in the work of Giovanni Botero (1544–1617) and later in Baron de Montesquieu's (1689–1755) climatic determinism. Based on the assumption that a country's climate shapes the character of its population, and hence to a large extent the most suitable form of government, Bodin postulated that a hereditary monarchy would be the ideal regime for a temperate nation such as France. This power should be \\"sovereign\\", i.e., not be subject to any other branch, though to some extent limited by institutions like the high courts (Parlement) and representative assemblies (États). Above all, the monarch is \\"responsible only to God\\", that is, must stand above confessional factions. The work soon became widely known. Gaspar de Anastro made a Spanish translation in 1590.J. H. Elliott, The Count-Duke of Olivares (1986), p. 182. Richard Knolles put together an English translation (1606); this was based on the 1586 Latin version, but in places follows other versions. It appeared under the title The Six Bookes of a Common-weale.Rose, p. 288 note 26. Title page of De la démonomanie des sorciers (1580) =De la démonomanie des sorciers (Of the Demon-mania of the Sorcerers)= Bodin's major work on sorcery and the witchcraft persecutions was first issued in 1580, ten editions being published by 1604.1580 ed. of De la Demonomanie des Sorciers In it he elaborates the influential concept of \\"pact witchcraft\\" based on a deal with the DevilPurkiss, p. 64. and the belief that the evil spirit would utilize a strategy to impose doubt on judges to look upon magicians as madmen and hypochondriacs deserving of compassion rather than chastisement. The book relates histories of sorcerers,E. M. Butler, The Fortunes of Faust (1998), p. 7. but does not mention Faust and his pact.E. M. Butler, Myth of the Magus, p. 129. It gave a report of a 1552 public exorcism in Paris,Sarah Ferber, Demonic Possession and Exorcism in Early Modern France (2004), p. 30. and of the case of Magdalena de la Cruz of Cordova, an abbess who had confessed to sexual relations with the Devil over three decades.Ferber, p.118. Bodin cited Pierre Marner on werewolf accounts from Savoie.s:The Book of Were-Wolves/Chapter V He denounced the works of Cornelius Agrippa, and the perceived traffic in \\"sorceries\\" carried out along the Spanish Road, running along eastern France for much of its length.Owen Davies, Grimoires: A History of Magic Books (2009), p. 68 and p. 78. He wrote in extreme terms about procedures in sorcery trials, opposing the normal safeguards of justice.Pennethorne Hughes, Witchcraft (1969), p. 181. This advocacy of relaxation was aimed directly at the existing standards laid down by the Parlement of Paris (physical or written evidence, confessions not obtained by torture, unimpeachable witnesses).Barbara L. Bernier, The Praxis of Church and State in the (Under)Development of Women's Religion from France to the New World (PDF) p. 676–7 of article. He asserted that not even one witch could be erroneously condemned if the correct procedures were followed, because rumours concerning sorcerers were almost always true. Bodin's attitude has been called a populationist strategy typical of mercantilism.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246957308_Inflation_and_witchcraft_The_case_of_Jean_Bodin\\"Inflation and Witchcraft - The Case of Jean Bodin,\\" by Gunnar Heinsohn and Otto Steiger The book was influential in the debate over witchcraft; it was translated into German by Johann Fischart (1581),Peter Burke, European Renaissance, p. 137. online text. and in the same year into Latin by François Du Jon as De magorum dæmonomania libri IV. BVH page It was quoted by Jean de Léry, writing about the Tupinamba people of what is now Brazil.Purkiss, p. 252. One surviving copy of the text, located in the University of Southern California's Special Collections Library, is a rare presentation copy signed by Bodin himself, and is one of only two known surviving texts that feature such an inscription by the author. The USC Démonomanie dedication is to a C.L. Varroni, thought to be a legal colleague of Bodin's. Views =Law and politics= Bodin became well known for his analysis of sovereignty, which he took to be indivisible, and to involve full legislative powers (though with qualifications and caveats). With François Hotman (1524–1590) and François Baudouin (1520–1573), on the other hand, Bodin also supported the force of customary law, seeing Roman law alone as inadequate.General Crisis, p. 124Elliott, p. 92. He hedged the absolutist nature of his theory of sovereignty, which was an analytical concept; if later his ideas were used in a different, normative fashion, that was not overtly the reason in Bodin.Glenn Burgess, Ancient Constitution p. 123. Sovereignty could be looked at as a \\"bundle of attributes\\";Holt, p. 160. in that light the legislative role took centre stage, and other \\"marks of sovereignty\\" could be discussed further, as separate issues. He was a politique in theory, which was the moderate position of the period in French politics; but drew the conclusion that only passive resistance to authority was justified.Elliott, p. 224. Bodin's work on political theory saw the introduction of the modern concept of \\"state\\" but was in the fact on the cusp of usage (with that of Corasius), with the older meaning of a monarch \\"maintaining his state\\" not having dropped away.Ball etc Political Innovation, p. 120. Public office belonged to the commonwealth, and its holders had a personal responsibility for their actions.Wernham, p. 502. Politics is autonomous, and the sovereign is subject to divine and natural law, but not to any church; the obligation is to secure justice and religious worship in the state.Wernham, p. 490. Bodin studied the balance of liberty and authority.Isaiah Berlin, Freedom and Betrayal, p. 29. He had no doctrine of separation of powers and argued in a traditional way about royal prerogative and its proper, limited sphere. His doctrine was one of balance as harmony, with numerous qualifications; as such it could be used in different manners, and was. The key was that the central point of power should be above faction.Nicholas Henshall, The Myth of Absolutism (1992), pp. 126-127, p. 204. Rose sees Bodin's politics as ultimately theocratic,Rose, p. 276. and misunderstood by the absolutists who followed him. Where Aristotle argued for six types of state, Bodin allowed only monarchy, aristocracy and democracy. He advocated, however, distinguishing the form of state (constitution) from the form of government (administration).Wernham, p. 503-4. Bodin had a low opinion of democracy.Sheldon Wolin (2003), Tocqueville, Between Two Worlds, pp. 59-60. Families were the basic unit and model for the state;Kelley, p. 72. on the other hand John Milton found in Bodin an ally on the topic of divorce.Hill, Milton and the English Revolution, p. 123. Respect for individual liberty and possessions were the hallmark of the orderly state, a view Bodin shared with Hotman and George Buchanan.Wernham, p. 506. He argued against slavery.Peter Gay, The Enlightenment 2: The Science of Freedom (1996), p. 408. In matters of law and politics, Bodin saw religion as a social prop, encouraging respect for law and governance. =On change and progress= He praised printing as outshining any achievement of the ancients.Kelley, p. 232. The idea that the Protestant Reformation was driven by economic and political forces is attributed to him.Hill, Economic Problems of the Church, p. ix. He is identified as the first person to realize the rapid rate of change of early modern Europe.Glacken 446. In physics, he is credited as the first modern writer to use the concept of physical laws to define change,Rose, p. 273, citing d'Entrèves. but his idea of nature included the action of spirits. In politics, he adhered to the ideas of his time in considering a political revolution in the nature of an astronomical cycle: a changement (French) or simply a change (as translated 1606) in English;Perez Zagorin, Court & Country, p. 14. from Polybius Bodin took the idea of anacyclosis, or cyclic change of constitution.Kelley, p. 64. Bodin's theory was that governments had begun as monarchical, had then been democratic, before becoming aristocratic.Mazzotta, p. 168. =Religious tolerance= Public position In 1576 Bodin was engaged in French politics, and then argued against the use of compulsion in matters of religion, if unsuccessfully. Wars, he considered, should be subject to statecraft, and matters of religion did not touch the state. Bodin argued that a state might contain several religions; this was a very unusual position for his time, if shared by Michel de l'Hôpital and William the Silent. It was attacked by Pedro de Rivadeneira and Juan de Mariana, from the conventional opposing position of a state obligation to root out religious dissent.Davies, p. 134 note and p. 278. He argued in the Six livres that the Trial of the Knights Templar was an example of unjustified persecution, similar to that of the Jews and medieval fraternities.Marsha Keith Schuchard, Restoring the Temple of Vision: cabalistic freemasonry and Stuart culture (2002), p. 212; Google Books. Private position in the Colloquium In 1588 Bodin completed in manuscript a Latin work Colloquium heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis abditis (Colloquium of the Seven about Secrets of the Sublime). It is a conversation about the nature of truth between seven educated men, each with a distinct religious or philosophical orientation - a natural philosopher, a Calvinist, a Muslim, a Roman Catholic, a Lutheran, a Jew, and a skeptic.Kuntz. Because of this work, Bodin is often identified as one of the first proponents of religious tolerance in the western world. Truth, in Bodin's view, commanded universal agreement; and the Abrahamic religions agreed on the Old Testament (Tanakh).Wernham, p. 486. Vera religio (true religion) would command loyalty to the point of death; his conception of it was influenced by Philo and Maimonides.Rose, p. 281-2. His views on free will are also bound up with his studies in Jewish philosophy.Rose, p. 269. Some modern scholars have contested his authorship of the text. The \\"Colloquium of the Seven regarding the hidden secrets of the sublime things\\" offers a peaceful discussion with seven representatives of various religions and worldviews, who in the end agree on the fundamental underlying similarity of their beliefs. Bodin's theory, as based in considerations of harmony, resembles that of Sebastian Castellio.Rose, p. 270. He has been seen as a scriptural relativist, and deist, with Montaigne and Pierre Charron;Bedford, p. 244. also in the group of learned Christian Hebraists with John Selden, Carlo Giuseppe Imbonati, and Gerhard Vossius.Mazzotta, p. 102. By reputation, at least, Bodin was cited as an unbeliever, deist or atheist by Christian writers who associated him with perceived free-thinking and sceptical tradition of Machiavelli and Pietro Pomponazzi, Lucilio Vanini, Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza: Pierre-Daniel Huet,Israel, p. 454 . Nathaniel Falck,Israel, p. 632. Claude-François Houtteville.Israel, p. 498. Pierre Bayle attributed to Bodin a maxim about the intellectual consequences of the non-existence of God (a precursor of Voltaire's, but based on a traditional commonplace of French thinkers).Jonathan Israel, Enlightenment Contested (2006), p. 364. Wilhelm Dilthey later wrote that the protagonists in the Colloquium anticipate those of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's Nathan der Weise.Peter Gay, The Enlightenment I: The Rise of Modern Paganism (1973) p. 298. The Colloquium was one of the major and most popular manuscripts in clandestine circulation in the early modern period, with more than 100 copies catalogued.Israel, p. 690 it had an extensive covert circulation, after coming into intellectual fashion. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica states \\"It is curious that Leibniz, who originally regarded the Colloquium as the work of a professed enemy of Christianity, subsequently described it as a most valuable production\\". Its dissemination increased after 1700, even if its content was by then dated.Israel, p. 695. It was interpreted in the 18th century as containing arguments for natural religion, as if the views expressed by Toralba (the proponent of natural religion) were Bodin's; wrongly, according to Rose, whose reconstruction of Bodin's religious views is a long way from belief in a detached deity.Rose. Grotius had a manuscript. Gottfried Leibniz, who criticized the Colloquium to Jacob Thomasius and Hermann Conring, some years later did editorial work on the manuscript. Henry Oldenburg wanted to copy it, for transmission to John Milton and possibly John Dury,Garber and Ayers I, pp. 415-6 or for some other connection in 1659.Lewalski, p. 670 note 35. In 1662 Conring was seeking a copy for a princely library.Lewalski, p. 406. It was not to be published in full until 1857, by Ludwig Noack, from manuscripts collected by Heinrich Christian von Seckenberg.Kurtz p. lxx. Personal religious convictions Bodin was influenced by philosophic Judaism to believe in the annihilation of the wicked 'post exacta supplicia'.D. P. Walker The decline of hell Seventeenth-Century Discussions of Eternal Torment (9780226871066) Page 74 footnoted 1857 Megaloburgiensium p341-4. =Cultural and universal history and geography= Bodin was a polymath, concerned with universal history which he approached as a jurist. He belonged to an identifiable French school of antiquarian and cultural history, with Lancelot Voisin de La Popelinière, Louis Le Caron, Louis Le Roy, Étienne Pasquier and Nicolas Vignier.Isaiah Berlin, Proper Study, p. 333. Historical disciples included Jacques Auguste de Thou and William Camden. The genre thus founded, drawing social conclusions, identified itself as \\"civil history\\", and was influenced particularly by Polybius.Trevor-Roper, p. 135-6 The Methodus has been called the first book to advance \\"a theory of universal history based on a purely secular study of the growth of civilisation\\".Paul D. L. Avis, Foundations of modern historical thought: from Machiavelli to Vico (1986), p. 56; Google Books Bodin's secular attitude to history therefore goes some way to explain his perceived relationship to Machiavelli. While Bodin's common ground with Machiavelli is not so large, and indeed Bodin opposed the Godless vision of the world in Machiavelli,Mazzotta, p. 194. they are often enough paired, for example by A. C. Crombie as philosophical historians with contemporary concerns; Crombie also links Bodin with Francis Bacon, as rational and critical historians.Crombie, p. 35 and p. 383. Both Bodin and Machiavelli treat religion as situated historically.Shlomo Avineri, 16. Bodin drew largely on Johann Boemus, and also classical authors, as well as accounts from Leo Africanus and Francisco Álvares. He showed little interest, however, in the New World.Hodgen, p. 133 and pp. 113-4. In terms of theories of cultural diffusion he influenced Nathanael Carpenter, and many subsequently, with his \\"south-eastern origin\\" theory of the transmission from peoples of the Middle East to Greece and Rome (and hence to Northern Europe).Hodgen, p. 256) Another follower was Peter Heylyn in his Microcosmus (1621).Hodgen, pp. 284-5. In anthropology Bodin showed indications of polygenism as theory of human origins.Hodgen, p. 272. In clearer terms, on the other hand, he believed that mankind was unifying, the drivers being trade, and the indications of the respublica mundana (world commonwealth) and international law as developing. This was within a scheme of Vaticinium Eliae or three periods of 2000 years for universal history, to which he had little commitment, though indicating its connection with the three climate regions and their predominance.Ernst Breisach, Historiography: ancient, medieval, and modern (2007), p. 183–4; Google Books. The \\"south-eastern\\" theory depended for its explanation on Bodin's climate theory and astrology: it was given in the Methodus, and developed in Book VI of the Six Livres. He made an identification of peoples and geographical sectors with planetary influences, in Book V of the Six Livres.Bull, The Mirrors of the Gods, p. 26. His astrological theory is combined with the Hippocratic tradition; but not in the conventional way of Ptolemy. It has been suggested that he took them from a follower of Cardano, Auger Ferrier.Glacken, p. 435 note. Reception Bodin's conception of sovereignty was widely adopted in Europe. In a form simplified and adapted by others, such as the French jurists Charles Loyseau (1564–1627) and Cardin Le Bret (1558–1655), it played an important role in the development of absolutism.http://www.answers.com/topic/theory-of-sovereignty =In France= Influentially, Bodin defended an orderly Gallican monarchy against Huguenots, and any external interference.Holt, p. 102.Elliott, pp. 341-2. These general ideas became political orthodoxy, in the reign of Henry IV of France, tending to the beginnings of absolutism. Bodin had numerous followers as political theorist, including Pierre Grégoire, in whom with François Grimaudet legislative authority starts to become closer to the divine right of kings, and William Barclay.Richard Tuck (1993), Philosophy and Government (1572–1651), p. 28; Google Books.Douglas M. Johnston, The Historical Foundations of World Order: the tower and the arena (2008), p. 413; Google Books. Pierre Charron in La Sagesse of 1601 uses the idea of state from Bodin but with fewer limitations on royal power;J. H. Elliott, Richelieu and Olivares (1991), p. 44 Charron in this work argued for a secular neo-stoicism, putting together ideas of Montaigne and Lipsius with those of Bodin.McCrea, p. 27. Charles Loyseau in the years 1608-10 published absolutist works with the emphasis on orderliness in society, going much beyond Bodin's writing of thirty years earlier, a trend that continued into the 17th century.Mack P. Holt, The French Wars of Religion, 1562-1629 (1995), pp. 215-6. As a demonologist, his work was taken to be authoritative and based on experience as witch-hunting practitioner. As historian, he was prominently cited by Nicolas Lenglet Du Fresnoy in his 1713 Methode pour etudier l'Histoire.Herbert Butterfield, Man and his Past (1969), p. 3. Montesquieu read Bodin closely; the modern sociology hinted at in Bodin, arising from the relationship between the state apparatus on the one hand, and society on the other, is developed in Montesquieu.W. G. Runciman (1963), Social Science and Political Theory, p. 26. =In Germany= Bodin's rejection of the Four Monarchies model was unpopular, given the German investment in the Holy Roman Emperor as fourth monarch,Breisach, p. 181. the attitude of Johannes Sleidanus. The need to accommodate the existing structure of the Empire with Bodin as theorist of sovereignty led to a controversy running over nearly half a century; starting with Henning Arnisaeus, it continued unresolved to 1626 and the time of Christopher Besoldus. He drew a line under it, by adopting the concept of composite polyarchy, which held sway subsequently.J. H. Franklin, Sovereignty and the Mixed Constitution: Bodin and his critics, Chapter 10 in Burns. Leibniz rejected Bodin's view of sovereignty, stating that it might amount only to territorial control, and the consequence drawn by writers in Bodin's tradition that federalism was chimeric.Patrick Riley, The Political Writings of Leibniz (1981), p. 27 and p. 117 note. =In England= Generally the English took great interest in the French Wars of Religion; their literature came into commonplace use in English political debate,Wernham, p. 505. and Amyas Paulet made immediate efforts to find the Six livres for Edward Dyer. Shortly Bodin's works were known in England: to Philip Sidney, Walter Ralegh, and to Gabriel Harvey who reported they were fashionable in Oxford. His ideas on inflation were familiar by 1581.Elliott, p. 63. Somerville makes the point that not all those who discussed sovereignty in England at this period necessarily took their views from Bodin: the ideas were in the air at the time, and some such as Hadrian à Saravia and Christopher Lever had their own reasoning to similar conclusions.J. P. Somerville, Politics and Ideology in England 1603–1640 (1986), p. 38. Richard Hooker had access to the works, but doesn't reference them.Secor, Richard Hooker, p. 246 and p. 274. John Donne cited Bodin in his Biathanatos.Johann Somerville in Colclough (editor), John Donne's Professional Life, p. 88. Bodin's view of parallelism of French and English monarchies was accepted by Ralegh.Cooper, p. 100. Roger Twysden dissented: in his view, the English monarchy had never fitted Bodin's definition of sovereignty.Cooper, p. 109. Richard Beacon in Solon His Follie (1594), directed towards English colonisation in Ireland, used text derived from the Six livres, as well as much theory from Machiavelli; he also argued, against Bodin, that France was a mixed monarchy.Sydney Anglo, A Machiavellian Solution to the Irish Problem: Richard Beacon's Solon His Follie (1594), pp. 154–5 and note, in Edward Chaney and Peter Mack (editors), England and the Continental Renaissance (1990). Bodin influenced the controversial definitions of John Cowell, in his 1607 book The Interpreter, that caused a furore in Parliament during 1610.G. R. Elton, Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government I (1974), p. 268. Edward Coke took from Bodin on sovereignty; and like him opposed the concept of mixed monarchy.Cooper, p. 98-102. While Bodin's ideas on authority fitted with the theory of divine right of kings, his main concern was not with the choice of the sovereign. But that meant they could cut both ways, being cited by parliamentarians as well as royalists. Henry Parker in 1642 asserted the sovereignty of Parliament by Bodinian reasoning.Derek Hirst, England in Conflict 1603-1660 (1999), p. 24. James Whitelocke used Bodin's thought in discussing the King-in-Parliament. The royalist Robert Filmer borrowed largely from Bodin for the argument of his Patriarcha. John Locke in arguing decades later against Filmer in Two Treatises of Government didn't go behind his work to attack Bodin; but his ally James Tyrrell did, as did Algernon Sidney.John Locke, editor Peter Laslett, Two Treatises of Government (1990), p. 181 note. Another royalist user of Bodin was Michael Hudson. John Milton used Bodin's theory in defending his anti-democratic plan for a Grand Council, after Oliver Cromwell's death.Lewalski, p. 393. Sir John Eliot summarized work of Arnisaeus as critic of Bodin, and wrote in the Tower of London following Bodin that a lawful king, as opposed to a tyrant, \\"will not do what he may do\\", in his De iure majestatis.John Morrill, The Nature of the English Revolution, pp/ 288-9. Robert Bruce Cotton quoted Bodin on the value of money;Joyce Oldham Appleby, Economic Thought and Ideology in Seventeenth-Century England (1978) p. 49. Robert Burton on politics in the Anatomy of Melancholy.Trevor-Roper, p. 247. Richard Knolles in the introduction to his 1606 translation commended the book as written by a man experienced in public affairs.Kenneth Charlton, Education in Renaissance England (1965) pp. 250-1. William Loe complained, in preaching to Parliament in 1621, that Bodin with Lipsius and Machiavelli was too much studied, to the neglect of Scripture.McCrea, p. 31. Richard Baxter on the other hand regarded the reading of Bodin, Hugo Grotius and Francisco Suárez as a suitable training in politics, for lawyers.William Lamont, Richard Baxter and the Millennium (1979), p. 114. Bodin's views on witchcraft were taken up in England by the witch-hunter Brian Darcy in the early 1580s, who argued for burning rather than hanging as a method of execution, and followed some of Bodin's suggestions in interrogating Ursula Kemp.Barbara Rosen, Witchcraft in England, 1558-1618 (1969), p. 121–2 note; Google Books. They were also radically opposed by Reginald Scott in his sceptical work Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584). Later Francis Hutchinson was his detractor, criticising his methodology. =In Italy= Bodin mentioned on the title page of Fabio Albergati's Discorsi politici, in 1602. Albergati wrote against Bodin from 1595, comparing his political theories unfavourably with those of Aristotle.Bouwsma, p. 300 and p. 330. In Italy Bodin was seen as a secular historian like Machiavelli. At the time of the Venetian Interdict, Venetians agreed with the legislative definition of sovereignty. In particular Paolo Sarpi argued that Venice's limited size in territorial terms was not the relevant point for the actions it could undertake on its own authority.Bouwsma, p. 438. Later Giambattista Vico was to take Bodin's cultural history approach noticeably further.Isaiah Berlin, Against the Current p. 104. =The Papacy= Works of Bodin were soon placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum for various reasons, including discussion of Fortune (against free will), and reason of state. The Methodus went on the Index in 1590;Bouwsma, p. 305. Robert Bellarmine as censor found it of some merit in its learning, but the author to be a heretic or atheist, critical of the papacy and much too sympathetic to Charles Du Moulin in particular.Peter Godman, The Saint as Censor: Robert Bellarmine between inquisition and index (2000), pp. 123–4; Google Books. Other works followed in 1593.Bouwsma, p. 330. All his work was placed on the Index in 1628; the prohibition on the Theatrum continued into the 20th century. Venetian theologians were described as followers of Machiavelli and Bodin by Giovanni Amato.Bouwsma, p. 445. Bellarmine's Tractatus de potestate summi pontificis in temporalibus reiterated, against Bodin's sovereignty theory, an indirect form of the traditional papal deposing power to release subjects from the duty of obedience to tyrants.Roland Mousnier, The Assassination of Henry IV, (English translation 1973), p. 253. Jakob Keller, in an apologetical work on behalf of limited justifications for tyrannicide, treated Bodin as a serious opponent on the argument that subjects can only resist a tyrant passively, with views on the Empire that were offensive.Harro Höpfl, Jesuit Political Thought: the Society of Jesus and the state, c. 1540-1630 (2004), p. 332; Google Books. =In Spain= On 1583 Bodin was placed on the Quiroga Index.Henry Kamen, Inquisition and Society in Spain, p. 85. Against tyrannicide, Bodin's thought was out of step of conventional thinking in Spain at the time.Cooper, p. 101. It was recognized, in an unpublished dialogue imagined between Bodin and a jurist of Castile, that the government of Spain was harder than that of France, the other major European power, because of the more complex structure of the kingdom.J. H. Elliott, Richelieu and Olivares (1991), p. 118. Bodin's view of witchcraft was hardly known in Spain until the 18th century.Ankarloo and Henningsen (editors), Early Modern European Witchcraft, p. 34. Notes References * Blair, Ann. (1997).

By utilizing additional digital subcarriers or sidebands, digital information is \\"multiplexed\\" on an AM or FM analog signal, thus avoiding re-allocation of the broadcast bands. However, by putting RF energy outside of the normally-defined channel, interference to adjacent channel stations is increased when using digital sidebands. The addition of the digital sidebands works better in the United States, where the FM broadcast band channels have a spacing of 200 kHz, as opposed to the 100 kHz that is normal elsewhere. The 200 kHz spacing means that in practice, stations having concurrent or adjacent coverage areas will not be spaced at less than 400 kHz. Outside of the US, spacing can be 300 kHz, which causes problems with the IBOC digital sidebands. IBOC does allow for multiple program channels, though this can entail taking some existing subcarriers off the air to make additional bandwidth available in the modulation baseband. On FM, this could eventually mean removing stereo. On AM, IBOC is incompatible with analog stereo, and any additional channels are limited to highly compressed voice, such as traffic and weather. Eventually, stations can go from hybrid mode (both analog and digital) to all-digital, by eliminating the baseband monophonic audio. FM methods On FM there are currently three methods of IBOC broadcasting in use, mainly in the United States. =HD Radio Broadcasting= The first, and currently only, digital technology approved for use on AM and FM broadcast frequencies by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, is the proprietary HD Radio system developed by iBiquity Digital Corporation, which transmits energy beyond the allotted ±100 kHz FM channel. This creates potential interference issues with adjacent channels. This is the most widespread system in use, with approximately 1,556 stations transmitting HD radio in the US, plus over 800 new multicast channels (as of Jan 2010). There is a one-time license fee to iBiquity Digital, for the use of its intellectual property, as well as costs for new equipment which range from $50,000 to $100,000 US (2010) per station. =FMeXtra= The other system is FMeXtra by Digital Radio Express, which instead uses subcarriers within the existing signal. This system was introduced more recently. The system is compatible with HD Radio in hybrid mode, but not in all-digital mode, and with RBDS. The stereo subcarrier can be removed to make more space available for FMeXtra in the modulation baseband. However, the system is not compatible with other existing 67–92 kHz subcarriers which have mostly fallen into disuse. The system is far less expensive and less complicated to implement, needing only to be plugged into the existing exciter, and requiring no licensing fees. FMeXtra has generally all the user features of HD Radio, including multicast capability; the ability to broadcast several different audio programs simultaneously. It uses the aacPlus (HE-AAC) codec. FMeXtra can control listening with conditional access and encryption. =DRM= Digital Radio Mondiale allows for simultaneous transmission of multiple data streams alongside an audio signal. The DRM mode for VHF provides bandwidths from between 35 kbit/s to 185 kbit/s and up to four simultaneous data streams, allowing 5.1 surround DVD quality audio to be broadcast alongside other multimedia content - images, video or HTML content are typical examples.http://www.owdjim.gen.nz/chris/radio/DRM/ While it is not backwardly compatible with existing FM receiver equipment, with broadcasts digitally encoded using HE-AAC or xHE-AAC, this ability to operate within the internationally agreed FM spectrum of 88-108 MHz makes DRM a viable candidate for future adoption when countries begin to switch off their analogue broadcasts. AM methods =HD Radio Broadcasting= iBiquity also created a mediumwave HD Radio system for AM, which is the only system approved by the Federal Communications Commission for digital AM broadcasting in the United States. The HD Radio system employs use of injected digital sidebands above and below the audible portion of the analog audio on the primary carrier. This system also phase modulates the carrier in quadrature and injects more digital information on this phase-modulated portion of the carrier. It is based on the principle of AM stereo where it puts a digital signal where the C-QUAM system would put the analog stereo decoding information. =DRM= Digital Radio Mondiale has had much more success in creating an AM system, and one that could be much less expensive to implement than any proprietary HD Radio system, although it requires new frequency. It is the only one to have been accepted mediumwave but also shortwave (and possibly longwave) by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for use in regions I and III, but not yet in region II, the Americas. The HD Radio system has also been approved by International Telecommunication Union. =CAM-D= CAM-D is yet another method, though it is more of an extension of the current system. Developed by AM stereo pioneer Leonard R. Kahn, It encodes the treble on very small digital sidebands which do not cause interference to adjacent channels, and mixes it back with the analog baseband. Unlike the other two, it is not intended to be capable of multichannel, opting for quality over quantity. Unlike the HD system iBiquity calls \\"hybrid digital\\" the CAM-D system truly is a direct hybrid of both analog and digital. Some engineers believe that CAM-D may be compatible with analog AM stereo with the right engineering. Critics of CAM-D point to several drawbacks: #being primarily analog, the system will be just as subject to artificial interference and noise as the current AM system #there are virtually no receivers available for the system and at present, no major manufacturer has announced even the intention to begin production of them; and #the cost of retrofitting with CAM-D is more than that of simply buying a new, HD-ready solid state transmitter.  IBOC Versus DAB  While the United Kingdom and many other countries have chosen the Eureka 147 standard of digital audio broadcasting (DAB) for creating a digital radio service, the United States has selected IBOC technology for its digital AM and FM stations. The band commonly used for terrestrial DAB is part of VHF band III, which does not suffer from L-band's significant line-of-sight problems. However, it is not available in North America since that span is occupied by TV channels 7 to 13 and the amateur radio 1.25 meter (222 MHz) band. The stations currently occupying that spectrum did not wish to give up their space, since VHF offers several benefits over UHF: relatively lower power, long distance propagation (up to 100 miles (160 km) with a rooftop antenna), and a longer wavelength that is more robust and less affected by interference. In Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) is continuing to follow the analog standard, so the channels remain unavailable there as well. HD Radio testing has been authorized in Canada, as well as other countries around the world. There was also concern that AM and FM stations' branding, using their current frequencies, would be lost to new channel numbers, though virtual channels such as on digital television would eliminate this. Also, several competing stations would have to share a transmitter that multiplexes them all into one ensemble with the same coverage area (though many FM stations are already diplexed in large cities such as New York). A further concern to FM station operators was that AM stations could suddenly be in competition with the same high audio quality, although FM would still have the advantage of higher data rates (300 kbit/s versus 60 kbit/s in the HD Radio standard) due to greater bandwidth (100 kHz versus 10 kHz). The most significant advantage for IBOC is its relative ease of implementation. Existing analog radios are not rendered obsolete and the consumer and industry may transition to digital at a rational pace. In addition, the technology infrastructure is in place: most major broadcast equipment manufacturers are implementing IBOC technology and 60+ receiver manufacturers are selling IBOC reception devices. In the UK, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland, which are the leading countries with regard to implementing DAB, the first-generation MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (MP2) codec stereo radio stations on DAB have a lower sound- quality than FM, prompting a number of complaints. (Norwegian) The typical bandwidth for DAB programs is only 128 kbit/s using the first generation CODEC, the less-robust MP2 standard which requires at least double that rate to be considered near-CD quality. An updated version of the Eureka-147 standard called DAB+ has been implemented. Using the more efficient high quality MPEG-4 CODEC HE-AAC v2, this compression method allows the DAB+ system to carry more channels or have better sound quality at the same bit rate as the original DAB system. It is the DAB+ implementation which will be under consideration for new station designs and not the earlier DAB scheme using the MUSICAM CODEC. The DAB+ system was coordinated and developed by the World DAB Forum, formed in 1997 from the old organization. It gives the Eureka-147 system a similar quality per bit rate as the IBOC system and hence (arguably) a better sound quality than FM. Challenges AM IBOC in the United States still faces some serious technological challenges of its own, including nighttime interference with other stations. iBiquity was previously using PAC (also used at a higher bitrate in Sirius satellite radio, see Digital Audio Radio Service), but in August 2003 a switch to HDC (based-upon ACC) was made to rectify these problems. HDC has been customized for IBOC, and it is also likely that the patent rights and royalties for every transmitter and receiver can be retained longer by creating a more proprietary system. Digital Radio Mondiale is also developing an IBOC system, likely to be used worldwide with AM shortwave radio, and possibly with broadcast AM and FM. Neither of those have been approved yet for ITU region 2 (the Americas). The system, however, unlike HD Radio, does not permit the existing analog signal and the digital signal to live together in the same channel. DRM requires an additional channel to maintain both signals. Both AM and FM IBOC signals cause interference to adjacent-channel stations, but not within the station’s interference-free protected contours designated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). It has led to derogatory terms such as IBAC (In-band adjacent-channel) and IBUZ (since the interference sounds like a buzz.) The range of a station on an HD Radio receiver is somewhat less than its analog signal. However, in June, 2008, a group of US broadcasters and equipment manufacturers requested that the U.S. FCC increase the permissible FM IBOC power from 1% (currently) to a maximum of 10% of the analog power. On January 29, 2010, the FCC approved the request. In addition, tropospheric ducting and e-skip can reduce the range of the digital signal, as well as the analog. In-band on-channel digital radios using iBiquity's standard are being marketed under the brand \\"HD Radio\\" to highlight the purported quality of reception. As of June 2008, over 60 different receiver models have been made, and stations have received blanket (no longer individual and experimental) authorization from the U.S. FCC to transmit in a multiplexed multichannel mode on FM. Originally, the use of HD Radio transmission on AM was limited to daytime only, and not allowed at night due to potential problems with skywave radio propagation. The FCC lifted this restriction in early 2007. DRM, however, is being used across Europe on shortwave, which is entirely AM skywave, without issue. With the proper receiver, many of those stations can be heard in North America as well, sans the analog signal. IBOC around the world = Argentina = HD Radio technology was tested in 2004 with initial trials in Buenos Aires. Further testing of the technology began in early 2007. = Bangladesh = Government broadcaster BETAR began broadcasting HD Radio on their 100.0 MHz frequency on 9 November 2016 from their Agargaon site in Dhaka. The transmission uses a 10 kW GatesAir system. The 100.0 MHz carries programs from BBC World Service amongst others. HD 1, 2, 3 and 4 are configured. A second transmission will also have HD radio added on 88.8 MHz from the same site. = Bosnia = Trial and tests of HD Radio technology began in Sarajevo in March 2007. = Brazil = HD Radio and DRM trials in Brazil started in the mid 2000s. No regular HD Radio or DRM transmissions are allowed in Brazil as the digital radio standard in that country is not yet defined. One or two year experimental licenses were given to some Broadcasters. A joint study by the government (Ministry of Communications and ANATEL) and the National Metrology Institute (Inmetro) was done and the Digital Radio Consultative Council concluded that HD Radio and DRM do not meet the same analog transmission coverage with 20db less power. New trials are expected to occur before any decision about the Brazilian Digital Radio standard. Brazil is considering for adoption Digital Radio Mondiale or HD Radio. = Canada = After having L-band DAB for several years, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) have also looked at the use of HD Radio, given its gradual progress in the neighbouring U.S. The CBC began HD Radio testing in September 2006, focusing on transmissions from Toronto and Peterborough, Ontario. The CRTC has since revised its policy on digital radio to allow HD Radio operations.Public Notice CRTC 2006-160 = Czech Republic = Initial testing of the HD Radio system commenced in Prague in February 2007. = China = In China, Hunan Broadcasting Company started FMeXtra transmissions in Changsha in April 2007, and plans to put others throughout the Hunan province.

After conducting several military campaigns, he was elected King of Bohemia in 1469 and adopted the title Duke of Austria in 1487. He was the son of John Hunyadi, Regent of Hungary, who died in 1456. In 1457, Matthias was imprisoned along with his older brother, Ladislaus Hunyadi, on the orders of King Ladislaus the Posthumous. Ladislaus Hunyadi was executed, causing a rebellion that forced King Ladislaus to flee Hungary. After the King died unexpectedly, Matthias's uncle Michael Szilágyi persuaded the Estates to unanimously proclaim Matthias king on 24 January 1458. He began his rule under his uncle's guardianship, but he took effective control of government within two weeks. As king, Matthias waged wars against the Czech mercenaries who dominated Upper Hungary (today parts of Slovakia and Northern Hungary) and against Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who claimed Hungary for himself. In this period, the Ottoman Empire conquered Serbia and Bosnia, terminating the zone of buffer states along the southern frontiers of the Kingdom of Hungary. Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463, acknowledging the Emperor's right to style himself King of Hungary. The Emperor returned the Holy Crown of Hungary with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464. In this year, Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia. He soon realized he could expect no substantial aid from the Christian powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy. Matthias introduced new taxes and regularly collected extraordinary taxes. These measures caused a rebellion in Transylvania in 1467, but he subdued the rebels. The next year, Matthias declared war on George of Poděbrady, the Hussite King of Bohemia, and conquered Moravia, Silesia, and Lausitz, but he could not occupy Bohemia proper. The Catholic Estates proclaimed him King of Bohemia on 3 May 1469, but the Hussite lords refused to yield to him even after the death of their leader George of Poděbrady in 1471. Instead, they elected Vladislaus Jagiellon, the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland. A group of Hungarian prelates and lords offered the throne to Vladislaus's younger brother Casimir, but Matthias overcame their rebellion. Having routed the united troops of Casimir IV and Vladislaus at Breslau in Silesia (now Wrocław in Poland) in late 1474, Matthias turned against the Ottomans, who had devastated the eastern parts of Hungary. He sent reinforcements to Stephen the Great, Prince of Moldavia, enabling Stephen to repel a series of Ottoman invasions in the late 1470s. In 1476, Matthias besieged and seized Šabac, an important Ottoman border fort. He concluded a peace treaty with Vladislaus Jagiellon in 1478, confirming the division of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown between them. Matthias waged a war against Emperor Frederick and occupied Lower Austria between 1482 and 1487. Matthias established one of the earliest professional standing armies of medieval Europe (the Black Army of Hungary), reformed the administration of justice, reduced the power of the barons, and promoted the careers of talented individuals chosen for their abilities rather than their social statuses. Matthias patronized art and science; his royal library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was one of the largest collections of books in Europe. With his patronage, Hungary became the first country to embrace the Renaissance from Italy. As Matthias the Just, the monarch who wandered among his subjects in disguise, he remains a popular hero of Hungarian folk tales. Early life house where Matthias Corvinus was born in Kolozsvár (present-day Cluj-Napoca, Romania) Matthias Corvinus as young monarch. Museum of Sforza Castle, Milan, Italy. =Childhood (1443–1457)= Matthias was born in Kolozsvár (now Cluj- Napoca in Romania) on 23 February 1443. He was the second son of John Hunyadi and his wife, Elizabeth Szilágyi. Matthias' education was managed by his mother due to his father's absence. Many of the most learned men of Central Europeincluding Gregory of Sanok and John Vitézfrequented John Hunyadi's court when Matthias was a child. Gregory of Sanok, a former tutor of King Vladislaus III of Poland, was Matthias's only teacher whose name is known. Under these scholars' influences, Matthias became an enthusiastic supporter of Renaissance humanism. As a child, Matthias learnt many languages and read classical literature, especially military treatises. According to Antonio Bonfini, Matthias \\"was versed in all the tongues of Europe\\", with the exceptions of Turkish and Greek. Although this was an exaggeration, it is without doubt that Matthias spoke Hungarian, Latin, Italian, Polish, Czech, and German. The late 16th-century Polish historian Krzystoff Warszewiecki wrote that Matthias had also been able to understand the Romanian language of the envoys of Stephen the Great, Prince of Moldavia. According to a treaty between John Hunyadi and Đorđe Branković, Despot of Serbia, Matthias and the Despot's granddaughter Elizabeth of Celje were engaged on 7 August 1451. Elizabeth was the daughter of Ulrich II, Count of Celje, who was related to King Ladislaus the Posthumous and an opponent of Matthias's father. Because of new conflicts between Hunyadi and Ulrich of Celje, the marriage of their children only took place in 1455. Elizabeth settled in the Hunyadis' estates but Matthias was soon sent to the royal court, implying that their marriage was a hidden exchange of hostages between their families. Elizabeth died before the end of 1455. John Hunyadi died on 11 August 1456, less than three weeks after his greatest victory over the Ottomans in Belgrade. John's elder sonMatthias's brotherLadislaus became the head of the family. Ladislaus's conflict with Ulrich of Celje ended with Ulrich's capture and assassination on 9 November. Under duress, the King promised he would never take his revenge against the Hunyadis for Ulrich's killing. However, the murder turned most baronsincluding Palatine Ladislaus Garai, Judge royal Ladislaus Pálóci, and Nicholas Újlaki, Voivode of Transylvaniaagainst Ladislaus Hunyadi. Taking advantage of their resentment, the King had the Hunyadi brothers imprisoned in Buda on 14 March 1457. The royal council condemned them to death for high treason and Ladislaus Hunyadi was beheaded on 16 March. Matthias was held in captivity in a small house in Buda. His mother and her brother Michael Szilágyi staged a rebellion against the King and occupied large territories in the regions to the east of the river Tisza. King Ladislaus fled to Vienna in mid-1457, and from Vienna to Prague in September, taking Matthias with him. The civil war between the rebels and the barons loyal to the monarch continued until the sudden death of the young King on 23 November 1457. Thereafter the Hussite Regent of BohemiaGeorge of Poděbradyheld Matthias captive. King Matthias' arrival in Buda - a painting by Henrik Weber =Election as king (1457–1458)= King Ladislaus died childless in 1457. His elder sister, Anna, and her husband, William III, Landgrave of Thuringia, laid claim to his inheritance but received no support from the Estates. The Diet of Hungary was convoked to Pest to elect a new king in January 1458. Pope Calixtus III's legate Cardinal Juan Carvajal, who had been John Hunyadi's admirer, began openly campaigning for Matthias. The election of Matthias as king was the only way of avoiding a protracted civil war. Ladislaus Garai was the first baron to yield. At a meeting with Matthias's mother and uncle, he promised that he and his allies would promote Matthias's election, and Michael Szilágyi promised that his nephew would never seek vengeance for Ladislaus Hunyadi's execution. They also agreed that Matthias would marry the Palatine's daughter Annahis executed brother's bride. Michael Szilágyi arrived at the Diet with 15,000 troops, intimidating the barons who assembled in Buda. Stirred up by Szilágyi, the noblemen gathered on the frozen River Danube and unanimously proclaimed the 14-year-old Matthias king on 24 January. At the same time, the Diet elected his uncle as regent. Reign =Early rule and consolidation (1458–1464)= George of Poděbrady and Matthias Corvinusa painting by Mikoláš Aleš Matthias's election was the first time that a member of the nobility mounted the royal throne in Hungary. Michael Szilágyi sent John Vitéz to Prague to discuss the terms of Matthias's release with George of Poděbrady. Poděbradywhose daughter Kunigunda Matthias promised to marryagreed to release his future son-in-law for a ransom of 60,000 gold florins. Matthias was surrendered to the Hungarian delegates in Strážnice on 9 February. With Poděbrady's mediation, he was reconciled with John Jiskra of Brandýs, the commander of the Czech mercenaries who dominated most of Upper Hungary. Matthias made his state entry into Buda five days later. He ceremoniously sat on the throne in the Church of Our Lady, but was not crowned, because the Holy Crown of Hungary had been in the possession of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor for almost two decades. The 14-year-old monarch administered state affairs independently from the outset, although he reaffirmed his uncle's position as Regent. For instance, Matthias instructed the citizens of Nagyszeben (now Sibiu in Romania) to reconcile their differences with Vlad Dracula, Prince of Wallachia on 3 March. Jiskra was the first baron who turned against Matthias. He offered the throne to Casimir IV of Polandthe husband of King Ladislaus V's younger sister Elisabethin late March but the General sejm of Poland rejected his offer. Matthias's commander Sebastian Rozgonyi defeated Jiskra's soldiers at Sárospatak but the Ottomans' invasion of Serbia in April forced Matthias to conclude an armistice with the Czechs. They were allowed to keep Sáros Castle (now Šariš Castle, Slovakia) and other fortified places in Upper Hungary. Matthias sent two prelatesAugust Salánki, Bishop of Győr, and Vincent Szilasi, Bishop of Vácto Prague to crown George of Poděbrady king. Upon their demand, the \\"heretic\\" Poděbrady swore loyalty to the Holy See. Matthias's golden florin depicting Madonna and Child, and King Saint Ladislaus Matthias's first Diet assembled in Pest in May 1458. The Estates passed almost fifty decrees that were ratified by Matthiasinstead of the Regenton 8 June. One decree prescribed that the King \\"must call and hold, and order to be held, a diet of all the gentlemen of the realm in person\\" every year on Whitsunday. Matthias held more than 25 Diets during his reign and convoked the Estates more frequently than his predecessors, especially between 1458 and 1476. The Diets were controlled by the barons, whom Matthias appointed and dismissed at will. For instance, he dismissed Palatine Ladislaus Garai and persuaded Michael Szilágyi to resign from the Regency after they entered into a league in the summer of 1458. The King appointed Michael Ország, who had been his father's close supporter, as the new Palatine. Most of Matthias's barons were descended from old aristocratic families but he also promoted the careers of members of the lesser nobility, or even of skilful commoners. For instance, the noble Zápolya brothers Emeric and Stephen owed their fortunes to Matthias's favour. Matthias's ordinary revenues amounted around 250,000 golden florins per year when his reign began. A decree passed at the Diet of 1458 explicitly prohibited the imposition of extraordinary taxes. However, an extraordinary taxone golden florin per each porta or peasant householdwas levied late that year. The Ottomans occupied the fort of Golubac in Serbia in August 1458; Matthias ordered the mobilization of all noblemen. He made a raid into Ottoman territory and defeated the enemy forces in minor skirmishes. King Stephen Thomas of Bosnia accepted Matthias's suzerainty. Matthias authorized his new vassal's son Stephen Tomašević to take possession of the parts of Serbia that had not been occupied by the Ottomans. At the turn of 1458 and 1459, Matthias held a Diet at Szeged to prepare for a war against the Ottoman Empire. However, gossip about a conspiracy compelled him to return to Buda. The rumours proved to be true because at least 30 baronsincluding Ladislaus Garai, Nicholas Újlaki, and Ladislaus Kanizsaimet in Németújvár (now Güssing in Austria) and offered the throne to Emperor Frederick III on 17 February 1459. Although the joint troops of the Emperor and the rebellious lords defeated a royal army at Körmend on 27 March, Garai had by that time died and Újlaki soon entered into negotiations with Matthias' envoys. Skirmishes along the western borderlands lasted for several months, preventing Matthias from providing military assistance to Tomašević against the Ottomans. The latter took Smederevo on 29 June, completing the conquest of Serbia. John Jiskra of Brandýsa picture by Mikoláš Aleš Jiskra swore an oath of loyalty to Emperor Frederick on 10 March 1461. Pope Pius II offered to mediate a peace treaty between the Emperor and Matthias. George of Poděbrady also offered his assistance. The representatives of the Emperor and Matthias signed a truce in Olomouc in April 1460. The Pope soon offered financial support for an anti- Ottoman campaign. However, John Jiskra returned from Poland, renewing the armed conflicts with Czech mercenaries in early 1460. Matthias seized a newly erected fort from the Czechs but he could not force them to obey him. The costs of his five-month-long campaign in Upper Hungary were paid for by an extraordinary tax. Matthias entered into an alliance with the Emperor's rebellious brother Albert VI, Archduke of Austria. George of Poděbrady sided with the Emperor, although the marriage of his daughterwho became known as Catherine in Hungaryto Matthias was celebrated on 1 May 1461. Relations between Matthias and his father-in-law deteriorated because of the Czech mercenaries' continued presence in Upper Hungary. Matthias launched a new campaign against them after the Diet authorized him to collect an extraordinary tax in mid-1461. However, he did not defeat Jiskra, who even captured Késmárk (now Kežmarok, Slovakia). The envoys of Matthias and Emperor Frederick agreed a peace treaty on 3 April 1462. According to the agreement, the Emperor was to return the Holy Crown of Hungary for 80,000 golden florins, but his right to use the title King of Hungary along with Matthias was confirmed. In accordance with the treaty, the Emperor adopted Matthias, which granted him the right to succeed his \\"son\\" if Matthias died without a legitimate heir. Within a month, Jiskra yielded to Matthias. He surrendered all the forts he held in Upper Hungary to the King's representatives; as compensation he received a large domain near the Tisza and 25,000 golden florins. To pay the large amounts stipulated in his treaties with the Emperor and Jiskra, Matthias collected an extraordinary tax with the consent of the Royal Council. The Diet, which assembled in mid-1462, confirmed this decision but only after 9 prelates and 19 barons promised that no extraordinary taxes would be introduced thereafter. Through hiring mercenaries among Jiskra's companions, Matthias began organizing a professional army, which became known as the \\"Black Army\\" in following decades. The Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II invaded Wallachia in early 1462. He did not conquer the country but the Wallachian boyars dethroned the anti-Ottoman Vlad Dracula, replacing him with the Sultan's favorite, Radu the Fair. The new Prince was willing to grant concessions to the Transylvanian Saxon merchants, who had come into bitter conflict with Vlad Dracula. The latter sought assistance from Matthias and they met in Brassó (now Brașov, Romania) in November. However, the Saxons presented Matthias with a letter allegedly written by Vlad Dracula to Sultan Mehmed, in which the Prince offered his support to the Ottomans. Convinced of Vlad Dracula's treachery, Matthias had him imprisoned. In preparation for a war against the Ottomans, Matthias held a Diet at Tolna in March 1463. Although the Estates authorized him to levy a one-florin extraordinary tax, he did not intervene when Mehmed II invaded Bosnia in June. In a month, the Ottomans murdered King Stephen Tomašević and conquered the whole country. Matthias only adopted an offensive foreign policy after the terms of his peace with Emperor Frederick were ratified in Wiener Neustadt on 19 July 1463. He led his troops to Bosnia and conquered Jajce and other forts in its northern parts. The conquered regions were organized into new defensive provinces, the banates of Jajce and Srebrenik. Matthias was assisted by Stefan Vukčić, Duke of Saint Sava, who controlled the area of modern and Old Hercegovina. A former vassal to the Bosnian kings, Stefan accepted Matthias's suzerainty. Queen Catherine died in early 1464 during preparations for her husband's coronation with the Holy Crown, which had been returned by Emperor Frederick. The ceremony was carried out in full accordance with the customary law of Hungary on 29 March 1464; Archbishop of Esztergom Dénes Szécsi ceremoniously put the Holy Crown on Matthias's head in Székesfehérvár. At the Diet assembled on this occasion, the newly crowned King confirmed the liberties of the nobility. Hereafter the legality of Matthias's reign could not be questioned. =First reforms and internal conflicts (1464–1467)= Matthias's signature and royal stamp Matthias's golden florin depicting King Saint Ladislaus and Matthias's coat-of-arms Matthias dismissed his Chief Chancellor Archbishop Szécsi, replacing him with Stephen Várdai, Archbishop of Kalocsa, and John Vitéz. Both prelates bore the title of Chief and Secret Chancellor, but Várdai was the actual leader of the Royal Chancery. Around the same time, Matthias united the superior courts of justicethe Court of Royal Special Presence and the Court of Personal Presenceinto one supreme court. The new supreme court diminished the authority of the traditional courts presided over by the barons and contributed to the professionalization of the administration of justice. He appointed Albert Hangácsi, Bishop of Csanád as the first Chief Justice. Sultan Mehmed II returned to Bosnia and laid siege to Jajce in July 1464. Matthias began assembling his troops along the river Száva, forcing the Sultan to raise the siege on 24 August. Matthias and his army crossed the river and seized Srebrnica. He also besieged Zvornik but the arrival of a large Ottoman army forced him to withdraw to Hungary. The following year, Matthias forced Stefan Vukčić, who had transferred Makarska Krajina to the Republic of Venice, to establish Hungarian garrisons in his forts along the river Neretva. Dénes Szécsi died in 1465 and John Vitéz became the new Archbishop of Esztergom. Matthias replaced the two Voivodes of TransylvaniaNicholas Újlaki and John Pongrác of Dengelegwith Counts Sigismund and John Szentgyörgyi, and Bertold Ellerbach. Although Újlaki preserved his office of Ban of Macsó, the King appointed Peter Szokoli to administer the province together with the old Ban. Matthias convoked the Diet to make preparations for an anti-Ottoman campaign in 1466. For the same purpose, he received subsidies from Pope Paul II. However, Matthias had realized that no substantial aid could be expected from the Christian powers and tacitly gave up his anti-Ottoman foreign policy. He did not invade Ottoman territory and the Ottomans did not make major incursions into Hungary, implying that he signed a peace treaty with Mehmed II's envoy who arrived in Hungary in 1465. Matthias visited Slavonia and dismissed the two Bans Nicholas Újlaki and Emeric Zápolya, replacing them with Jan Vitovec and John Tuz in 1466. Early the following year, he mounted a campaign in Upper Hungary against a band of Czech mercenaries who were under the command of Ján Švehla and had seized Kosztolány (now Veľké Kostoľany in Slovakia). Matthias routed them and had Švehla and his 150 comrades hanged. At the Diet of March 1467, two traditional taxes were renamed; the chamber's profit was thereafter collected as tax of the royal treasury and the thirtieth as the Crown's customs. Because of this change, all previous tax exemptions became void, increasing state revenues. Matthias set about centralizing the administration of royal revenues. He entrusted the administration of the Crown's customs to John Ernuszt, a converted Jewish merchant. Within two years, Ernuszt was responsible for the collection of all ordinary and extraordinary taxes, and the management of the salt mines. Matthias's tax reform caused a revolt in Transylvania. The representatives of the \\"Three Nations\\" of the provincethe noblemen, the Saxons and the Székelysformed an alliance against the King in Kolozsmonostor (now Mănăștur district in Cluj- Napoca, Romania) on 18 August, stating that they were willing to fight for the freedom of Hungary. Matthias assembled his troops immediately and hastened to the province. The rebels surrendered without resistance but Matthias severely punished their leaders, many of whom were impaled, beheaded, or mercilessly tortured upon his orders. Suspecting that Stephen the Great had supported the rebellion, Matthias invaded Moldavia. However, Stephen's forces routed Matthias's at the Battle of Baia on 15 December 1467. Matthias suffered severe injuries, forcing him to return to Hungary. =War for the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1468–1479)= Matthias's former brother-in-law Victor of Poděbrady invaded Austria in early 1468. Emperor Frederick appealed to Matthias for support, hinting at the possibility of Matthias's election as King of the Romansfirst step towards the imperial throne. Matthias declared war on Victor's father King George of Bohemia on 31 March. He said he also wanted to help the Czech Catholic lords against their \\"heretic monarch\\" whom the Pope had excommunicated. Matthias expelled the Czech troops from Austria and invaded Moravia and Silesia. He took an active part in the fighting; he was injured during the siege of Třebíč in May 1468 and was captured at Chrudim while spying out the enemy camp in disguise in February 1469. On the latter occasion, he was released because he made his custodians believe he was a local Czech groom. The Diet of 1468 authorized Matthias to levy an extraordinary tax to finance the new war, but only after 8 prelates and 13 secular lords pledged on the King's behalf that he would not demand such charges in the future. Matthias also exercised royal prerogatives to increase his revenues. For instance, he ordered a Palatine's eyre in a county, the cost of which were to be covered by the local inhabitants but soon authorized the county to redeem the cancellation of this irksome duty. The Czech Catholics, who were led by Zdeněk of Šternberk, joined forces with Matthias in February 1469. Their united troops were encircled at Vilémov by George of Poděbrady's army. In fear of being captured, Matthias opened negotiations with his former father-in-law. They met in a nearby hovel, where Matthias persuaded George of Poděbrady to sign an armistice promising that he would mediate a reconciliation between the moderate Hussites and the Holy See. Their next meeting took place in Olomouc in April. Here the papal legates came forward with demands including the appointment of a Catholic Archbishop to the See of Prague, which could not be accepted by George of Poděbrady. The Czech Catholic Estates elected Matthias King of Bohemia in Olomouc on 3 May but he was never crowned. Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia soon accepted his rule but Bohemia proper remained faithful to George of Poděbrady. The Estates of Bohemia even acknowledged the right of Vladislaus Jagiello, the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland, to succeed king George of Poděbrady. Conquests of Matthias Corvinus in Central Europe Matthias's relations with Frederick III had in the meantime deteriorated because the Emperor accused Matthias of allowing the Ottomans to march through Slavonia when raiding the Emperor's realms. The Frangepan family, whose domains in Croatia were exposed to Ottoman raids, entered into negotiations with the Emperor and the Republic of Venice. In 1469, Matthias sent an army to Croatia to prevent the Venetians from seizing the Adriatic coastal town Senj. Matthias expelled George of Poděbrady's troops from Silesia. Matthias's army was encircled and routed at Uherský Brod on 2 November, forcing him to withdraw to Hungary. Matthias soon ordered the collection of an extraordinary tax without holding a Diet, raising widespread discontent among the Hungarian Estates. He visited Emperor Frederick in Vienna on 11 February 1470, hoping the Emperor would contribute to the costs of the war against Poděbrady. Although the negotiations lasted for a month, no compromise was worked out. The Emperor also refused to commit himself to promoting Matthias's election as King of the Romans. After a month, Matthias left Vienna without taking formal leave of Frederick III. Having realised the Hungarian Estates' growing dissatisfaction, Matthias held a Diet in November. The Diet again authorized him to levy an extraordinary tax, stipulating that the sum of all taxes payable per porta could not exceed one florin. The Estates also made it clear that they opposed the war in Bohemia. George of Poděbrady died on 22 March 1471. The Diet of Bohemia proper elected Vladislaus Jagiello king on 27 May. The papal legate Lorenzo Roverella soon declared Vladislaus's election void and confirmed Matthias's position as King of Bohemia, but the Imperial Diet refused Matthias's claim. Matthias was staying in Moravia when he was informed that a group of Hungarian prelates and barons had offered the throne to Casimir, a younger son of King Casimir IV of Poland. The conspiracy was initiated by Archbishop John Vitéz and his nephew Janus Pannonius, Bishop of Pécs, who opposed war against the Catholic Vladislaus Jagiellon. Initially, their plan was supported by the majority of the Estates, but nobody dared to rebel against Matthias, enabling him to return to Hungary without resistance. Matthias held a Diet and promised to refrain from levying taxes without the consent of the Estates and to convoke the Diet in each year. His promises remedied most of the Estates' grievances and almost 50 barons and prelates confirmed their loyalty to him on 21 September. Casimir Jagiellon invaded on 2 October 1471. With Bishop Janus Pannonius's support, he seized Nyitra (now Nitra in Slovakia), but only two barons, John Rozgonyi and Nicholas Perényi, joined him. Within five months Prince Casimir withdrew from Hungary, Bishop Janus Pannonius died while fleeing, and Archbishop John Vitéz was forbidden to leave his see. Matthias appointed the Silesian Johann Beckensloer to administer the Archdiocese of Esztergom. Vitéz died and Beckensloer succeeded him in a year. The Ottomans had meanwhile seized the Hungarian forts along the river Nertva. Matthias nominated the wealthy baron Nicholas Újlaki as King of Bosnia in 1471, entrusting the defence of the province to him. Uzun Hassan, head of the Aq Qoyunlu Turkmens, proposed an anti-Ottoman alliance to Matthias but he refrained from attacking the Ottoman Empire. Matthias supported the Austrian noblemen who rebelled against Emperor Frederick in 1472. The following year, Matthias, Casimir IV and Vladislaus entered into negotiations on the terms of a peace treaty, but the discussions lasted for months. Matthias tried to unify the government of Silesia, which consisted of dozens of smaller duchies, through appointing a captain-general.

The next month, the envoys of Matthias and Casimir IV signed a peace treaty and a three-year truce between Matthias and Vladislaus Jagiellon was also declared. Within a month, however, Vladislaus entered into an alliance with Emperor Frederick and Casimir IV joined them. Casimir IV and Vladislaus invaded Silesia and laid siege to Matthias in Breslau (now Wrocław in Poland) in October. He prevented the besiegers from accumulating provisions, forcing them to raise the siege. Thereafter the Silesian Estates willingly elected Matthias's new candidate Stephen Zápolya as captain-general. The Moravian Estates elected Ctibor Tovačovský as captain- general. Matthias confirmed this decision, although Tovačovský had been Vladislaus Jagiellon's partisan. The Ottomans invaded Wallachia and Moldavia at the end of 1474. Matthias sent reinforcements under the command of Blaise Magyar to Stephen the Great. Their united forces routed the invaders in the Battle of Vaslui on 10 January 1475. Fearing a new Ottoman invasion, the Prince of Moldavia swore fealty to Matthias on 15 August. Sultan Mehmed II proposed peace but Matthias refused him. Instead, he stormed into Ottoman territory and captured Šabac, an important fort on the river Száva, on 15 February 1476. During the siege, Matthias barely escaped capture while he was watching the fortress from a boat. For unknown reasons, Archbishop Johann Beckensloer left Hungary, taking the treasury of the Esztergom See with him in early 1476. He fled to Vienna and offered his funds to the Emperor. Matthias accused the Emperor of having incited the Archbishop against him. Mehmed II launched a campaign against Moldavia in the summer of 1476. Although he won the Battle of Valea Albă on 26 July, the lack of provisions forced him to retreat. Matthias sent auxiliary troops to Moldavia under the command of Vlad Draculawhom he had releasedand Stephen Báthory The allied forces defeated an Ottoman army at the Siret River in August. With Hungarian and Moldavian support, Vlad Dracula was reinstalled as Prince of Wallachia but he was killed fighting against his opponent Basarab Laiotă. Matthias's bride Beatrice of Naples arrived in Hungary in late 1476. Matthias married her in Buda on 22 December that year. The Queen soon established a rigid etiquette, making direct contacts between the King and his subjects more difficult. According to Bonfini, Matthias also \\"improved his board and manner of life, introduced sumptuous banquets, disdaining humility at home and beautified the dining rooms\\" after his marriage. According to a contemporaneous record, around that time Matthias's revenues amounted about 500,000 florins, half of which derived from the tax of the royal treasury and the extraordinary tax. Matthias concluded an alliance with the Teutonic Knights and the Bishopric of Ermland against Poland in March 1477. However, instead of Poland, he declared war on Emperor Frederick after he learnt that the Emperor had confirmed Vladislaus Jagiellon's position as King of Bohemia and Prince-elector. Matthias invaded Lower Austria and imposed a blockade on Vienna. Vladislaus Jagiellon denied to support the Emperor, forcing him to seek reconciliation with Matthias. With the mediation of Pope Sixtus IV, Venice, and Ferdinand I of Naples, Matthias concluded a peace treaty with Frederick III, which was signed on 1 December. The Emperor promised to confirm Matthias as the lawful ruler of Bohemia and to pay him an indemnity of 100,000 florins. They met in Korneuburg where Frederick III installed Matthias as King of Bohemia and Matthias swore loyalty to the Emperor. Negotiations between the envoys of Matthias and Vladislaus Jagiellon accelerated during the next few months. The first draft of a treaty was agreed upon on 28 March 1478, and the text was completed by the end of 1477. The treaty authorized both monarchs to use the title of King of Bohemiaalthough Vladislaus could omit to style Matthias as such in their correspondenceand the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were divided between them; Vladislaus ruled in Bohemia proper and Matthias in Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia. They solemnly ratified the peace treaty at their meeting in Olomouc on 21 July. =War for Austria (1479–1487)= Coat of arms of Matthias Corvinus, guarded by Black Army heavy infantry. Matthias Church, Budapest. The damaged art relic was renovated in 1893. Emperor Frederick only paid off half of the indemnity due to Matthias according to their treaty of 1477. Matthias concluded a treaty with the Swiss Confederacy on 26 March 1479, hindering the recruitment of Swiss mercenaries by the Emperor. He also entered into an alliance with Archbishop of Salzburg Bernhard II of Rohr, who allowed him to take possession of the fortresses of the Archbishopric in Carinthia, Carniola and Styria. An Ottoman army supported by Basarab Țepeluș of Wallachia invaded Transylvania and set fire to Szászváros (now Orăștie in Romania) in late 1479. Stephen Báthory and Paul Kinizsi annihilated the marauders in the Battle of Breadfield on 13 October. Matthias united the command of all forts along the Danube to the west of Belgrade in the hand of Paul Kinizsi to improve the defence of the southern frontier. Matthias sent reinforcements to Stephen the Great, who invaded pro-Ottoman Wallachia in early 1480; Matthias launched a campaign as far as Sarajevo in Bosnia in November. He set up five defensive provinces, or banates, centred around the forts of Szörényvár (now Drobeta- Turnu Severin in Romania), Belgrade, Šabac, Srebrenik and Jajce. The next year, Matthias initiated a criminal case against the Frankapans, the Zrinskis and other leading Croatian and Slavonian magnates for their alleged participation in the 1471 conspiracy. Most barons were pardoned as soon as they consented to the introduction of a new land tax. In 1481, for a loan of 100,000 florins, Matthias seized the town of Mautern in Styria and Sankt Pölten in Lower Austria from Friedrich Mauerkircher, one of the two candidates to the Bishopric of Passau. Sultan Mehmed II died on 3 May 1481. A civil war ensued in the Ottoman Empire between his sons Bayezid II and Cem. Defeated, Cem fled to Rhodes, where the Knights Hospitaller kept him in custody. Matthias claimed Cem's custody in the hope of using him to gain concessions from Bayezid, but Venice and Pope Innocent VIII strongly opposed this plan. In late 1481, Hungarian auxiliary troops supported Matthias's father-in-law Ferdinand I of Naples to reoccupy Otranto, which had been lost to the Ottomans the year before. Although the \\"Black Army\\" had already laid siege to Hainburg an der Donau in January 1482, Matthias officially declared a new war on Emperor Frederick three months later. He directed the siege in person from the end of June and the town fell to him in October. In the next three months, Matthias also captured Sankt Veit an der Glan, Enzersdorf an der Fischa, and Kőszeg. The papal legate, Bartolomeo Maraschi tried to mediate a peace treaty between Matthias and the Emperor, but Matthias refused. Instead, he signed a five-year truce with Sultan Bayezid. Matthias's marriage to Beatrice of Naples did not produce sons; he tried to strengthen the position of his illegitimate son John Corvinus. The child received Sáros Castle and inherited the extensive domains of his grandmother Elizabeth Szilágyi with his father's consent. Matthias also forced Victor of Poděbrady to renounce the Duchy of Troppau in Silesia in favour of John Corvinus in 1485. Queen Beatrice opposed Matthias's favouritism towards his son. Even so, Matthias nominated her eight-year-old nephew Ippolito d'Este Archbishop of Esztergom. The Pope refused to confirm the child's appointment for years. The \\"Black Army\\" encircled Vienna in January 1485. The siege lasted for five months and ended with the triumphal entry of Matthias, at the head of 8,000 veterans, into Vienna on 1 June. The King soon moved the royal court to the newly conquered town. He summoned the Estates of Lower Austria to Vienna and forced them to swear loyalty to him. Upon the monarch's initiative, the Diet of 1485 passed the so-called Decretum maius, a systematic law-code which replaced many previous contradictory decrees. The law-code introduced substantial reforms in the administration of justice; the Palatine's eyre and the extraordinary county assemblies were abolished, which strengthened the position of the county courts. Matthias also decreed that in cases of the monarch's absence or minority, the Palatine was authorized to rule as Regent. Emperor Frederick persuaded six of the seven Prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire to proclaim his son Maximilian King of the Romans on 16 February 1486. The Emperor, however, had failed to invite the King of Bohemiaeither Matthias or Vladislaus Jagiellonto the assembly. In an attempt to prevail on Vladislaus to protest, Matthias invited him to a personal meeting. Although they formed an alliance in Jihlava in September, the Estates of Bohemia refused to confirm it and Vladislaus recognized Maximilian's election. In the meantime Matthias continued his war against the Emperor. The \\"Black Army\\" seized several towns in Lower Austria, including Laa an der Thaya, and Stein in 1485 and 1486. He set up his chancery for Lower Austria in 1486 but he never introduced a separate seal for this realm. Matthias assumed the title of Duke of Austria at the Diet of the Lower Austrian Estates in Ebenfurth in 1487. He appointed Stephen Zápolya captain- general, Urban Nagylucsei administrator of the Archdiocese of Vienna, and entrusted the defence of the occupied towns and forts to Hungarian and Bohemian captains, but otherwise continued to employ Emperor Frederick's officials who accepted his rule. Wiener Neustadt, the last town resisting Matthias in Lower Austria, fell to him on 17 August 1487. He started negotiations with Duke Albert III of Saxony, who arrived at the head of the imperial army to fight for Emperor Frederick III. They signed a six-month armistice in Sankt Pölten on 16 December, which ended the war. =Last years (1487–1490)= Europe at the end of the reign of King Matthias According to the contemporaneous Philippe de Commines, Matthias's subjects feared their King in the last years of his life because he rarely showed mercy towards those he suspected of treachery. He had Archbishop Peter Váradi imprisoned in 1484 and ordered the execution of his Chancellor of Bohemia Jaroslav Boskovic in 1485. He also imprisoned Nicholas Bánfi, a member of a magnate family, in 1487, although he had earlier avoided punishing the old aristocracy. Bánfi's imprisonment seems to have been connected to his marriage to a daughter of John the Mad, Duke of Glogau because Matthias tried to seize this duchy for John Corvinus. John the Mad entered into an alliance with the Duke of Münsterberg Henry of Poděbrady, and declared a war on Matthias on 9 May. Six month later, the Black Army invaded and occupied his duchy. In the meantime, the citizens of Ancona, a town in the Papal States, hoisted Matthias's flag in the hope he would protect them against Venice. Pope Innocent VIII soon protested, but Matthias refused to reject the overture, stating that the link between him and the town would never harm the interests of the Holy See. He also sent an auxiliary troop to his father-in-law, who was waging a war against the Holy See and Venice. The 1482 truce between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire was prolonged for two years in 1488. On this occasion, it was stipulated that the Ottomans were to refrain from invading Wallachia and Moldavia. The following year, Matthias granted two domains to Stephen the Great of Moldavia in Transylvania. Matthias, who suffered from gout, could not walk and was carried in a litter after March 1489. Hereafter, his succession caused bitter conflicts between Queen Beatrice and John Corvinus. Matthias asked Beatrice's brother Alfonso, Duke of Calabria, to persuade her not to strive for the Crown, stating that the \\"Hungarian people are capable of killing up unto the last man rather than submit to the government of a woman\\". To strengthen his illegitimate son's position, Matthias even proposed withdrawing from Austria and to confirm Emperor Frederick's right to succeed him, provided the Emperor was willing to grant Croatia and Bosnia to John Corvinus with the title of king. Matthias participated in the lengthy Palm Sunday ceremony in Vienna in 1490, although he had felt so ill that morning that he could not eat breakfast. Around noon, he tasted a fig that proved to be rotten and he became very agitated and suddenly felt faint. The next day he was unable to speak. After two days of suffering, Matthias died in the morning of 6 April. According to Professor Frigyes Korányi, Matthias died of a stroke; Dr. Herwig Egert does not exclude the possibility of poisoning. Matthias's funeral was held in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna and he was buried in Székesfehérvár Cathedral on 24 or 25 April 1490. Patronage =Renaissance king= Matthias's illegitimate son, John Corvinus triumphed in Vienna in 1485 Matthias was the first non-Italian monarch promoting the spread of Renaissance style in his realm. His marriage to Beatrice of Naples strengthened the influence of contemporaneous Italian art and scholarship, and it was under his reign that Hungary became the first land outside Italy to embrace the Renaissance. The earliest appearance of Renaissance style buildings and works outside Italy were in Hungary. The Italian scholar Marsilio Ficino introduced Matthias to Plato's ideas of a philosopher-king uniting wisdom and strength in himself, which fascinated Matthias. Matthias is the main character in Aurelio Lippo Brandolini's Republics and Kingdoms Compared, a dialogue on the comparison of the two forms of government. According to Brandolini, Matthias said a monarch \\"is at the head of the law and rules over it\\" when summing up his own concepts of state. Matthias also cultivated traditional art. Hungarian epic poems and lyric songs were often sung at his court. He was proud of his role as the defender of Roman Catholicism against the Ottomans and the Hussites. He initiated theological debates, for instance on the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, and surpassed both the Pope and his legate \\"with regard to religious observance\\", according to the latter. Matthias issued coins in the 1460s bearing an image of the Virgin Mary, demonstrating his special devotion to her cult. Upon Matthias's initiative, Archbishop John Vitéz and Bishop Janus Pannonius persuaded Pope Paul II to authorize them to set up a university in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) on 29 May 1465. The Academia Istropolitana was closed shortly after the Archbishop's death. Matthias was contemplating establishing a new university in Buda but this plan was not accomplished. =Building projects and arts= Matthias started at least two major building projects. The works in Buda and Visegrád began in about 1479. Two new wings and a hanging garden were built at the royal castle of Buda, and the palace at Visegrád was rebuilt in Renaissance style. Matthias appointed the Italian Chimenti Camicia and the Dalmatian Giovanni Dalmata to direct these projects. Matthias commissioned the leading Italian artists of his age to embellish his palaces: for instance, the sculptor Benedetto da Majano and the painters Filippino Lippi and Andrea Mantegna worked for him. A copy of Mantegna's portrait of Matthias survived. In the spring of 1485, Matthias decided to commission Leonardo da Vinci to paint a Madonna to him. Matthias also hired the Italian military engineer Aristotele Fioravanti to direct the rebuilding of the forts along the southern frontier. He had new monasteries built in Late Gothic style for the Franciscans in Kolozsvár, Szeged and Hunyad, and for the Paulines in Fejéregyháza. =Royal library= The Royal Palace in Buda, engraving from the 1480s The Renaissance palaces of the summer residence at Visegrád, engraving from the 1480s Matthias started the systematic collection of books after the arrival of his first librarian, Galeotto Marzio, a friend of Janus Pannonius from Ferrara in around 1465. The exchange of letters between Taddeo Ugoleto, who succeeded Marzio in 1471, and Francesco Bandini contributed to the development of the royal library because the latter regularly informed his friend of new manuscripts. Matthias also employed scriptors, illuminators, and book-binders. Although the exact number of his books is unknown, his Bibliotheca Corviniana was one of Europe's largest collections of books when he died. According to Marcus Tanne, the surviving 216 volumes of the King's library \\"show that Matthias had the literary tastes of a classic 'alpha male'\\", who preferred secular books to devotional works. For instance, a Latin translation of Xenophon's biography of Cyrus the Great, Quintus Curtius Rufus's book of Alexander the Great, and a military treatise by the contemporaneous Roberto Valturio survived. Matthias enjoyed reading, as demonstrated by a letter in which he thanked the Italian scholar Pomponio Leto who had sent him Silius Italicus's work of the Second Punic War. =Patron of scholars= Matthias enjoyed the company of Humanists and had lively discussions on various topics with them. The fame of his magnanimity encouraged many scholarsmostly Italianto settle in Buda. Antonio Bonfini, Pietro Ranzano, Bartolomeo Fonzio, and Francesco Bandini spent many years in Matthias's court. This circle of educated men introduced the ideas of Neoplatonism to Hungary. Like all intellectuals of his age, Matthias was convinced that the movements and combinations of the stars and planets exercised influence on individuals' life and on the history of nations. Galeotto Marzio described him as \\"king and astrologer\\", and Antonio Bonfini said Matthias \\"never did anything without consulting the stars\\". Upon his request, the famous astronomers of the age, Johannes Regiomontanus and Marcin Bylica, set up an observatory in Buda and installed it with astrolabes and celestial globes. Regiomontanus dedicated his book on navigation that was used by Christopher Columbus to Matthias. The King appointed Bylica as his advisor in 1468. According to Scott E. Hendrix, \\"establishing a prominent astrologer as his political advisor provided an anxiety-reduction mechanism that boosted morale for the political elites within his realm while strengthening his sense of control in the face of the multiple adversities the Hungarians faced\\" in his reign. Family Matthias's first wife Elizabeth of Celje was a child when their marriage took place in 1455. She died in September before the marriage was consummated. His second wife Catherine of Poděbrady was born in 1449. She died in childbirth in January or February 1464. The child did not survive. Matthias approached Emperor Frederick to suggest a new bride for him among Frederick's relatives. Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg proposed one of his daughters to Matthias but the Hungarian Estates opposed this plan. In an attempt to enter into an alliance with King Casimir IV of Poland, Matthias proposed to the King's daughter Hedvig but he was refused. During the 1470 meeting of Emperor Frederick and Matthias, a marriage between Matthias and the Emperor's five-year-old daughter Kunigunde of Austria was also discussed, but the Emperor was not willing to commit himself to the marriage. Matthias's third wife Beatrice of Naples was born in 1457. Their engagement was announced in Breslau on 30 October 1474, during the siege of the town by Casimir IV and Vladislaus Jagiellon. Her dowry amounted to 200,000 gold pieces. Beatrice survived her husband and returned to Naples where she died in 1508. Matthias's only known child John Corvinus was born out of wedlock in 1473. His mother Barbara Edelpöckthe daughter of a citizen of Stein in Lower Austriamet the King in early 1470. John Corvinus died on 12 October 1504. Legacy Matthias Corvinus Monument in front of St. Michael's Church (Cluj-Napoca) According to Marcus Tanner, Matthias ruled \\"a European superpower\\" at the end of his reign. His conquests, however, were lost within months of his death. The burghers of Breslau soon murdered his captain Heinz Dompnig. The Emperor's rule in Vienna and Wiener Neustadt was restored without resistance. Stephen Zápolya said the King's death relieved \\"Hungary of the trouble and oppression from which it had suffered so far\\". Royal authority quickly diminished because various claimantsJohn Corvinus, Maximilian of the Romans, Vladislaus Jagiellon, and the latter's younger brother, John Albertwere fighting for the crown. Vladislaus Jagiellon triumphed because the barons regarded him as a weak ruler and he gained the support of Matthias's wealthy widow by promising to marry her. Vladislaus was elected king after he promised he would abolish all \\"harmful innovations\\" introduced by Matthias, especially the extraordinary tax. Vladislaus could not finance the maintenance of the Black Army and the unpaid mercenaries began plundering the countryside. A royal force led by Paul Kinizsi eliminated them on the river Száva in 1492. The burden of Matthias's wars and splendid royal court mainly fell on the peasants, who paid at least 85% of the taxes. The Chronicle of Dubnic, written in eastern Hungary in 1479, says \\"widows and orphans\\" cursed the King for the high taxes. However, stories about \\"Matthias the Just\\", who wandered in disguise throughout his realm to deliver justice to his subjects, seem to have spread during Matthias's reign. The saying \\"Dead is Matthias, lost is justice\\" became popular soon after his death, reflecting that commoners were more likely to have received a fair trial in Matthias's reign than under his successors. Matthias is also the subject of popular folk tales in Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, and Slovenia. For instance, King Matjaž is one of the sleeping kings of Slovenian folklore.

As a field of applied statistics concentrating on human-research surveys, survey methodology studies the sampling of individual units from a population and associated techniques of survey data collection, such as questionnaire construction and methods for improving the number and accuracy of responses to surveys. Survey methodology targets instruments or procedures that ask one or more questions that may or may not be answered. Researchers carry out statistical surveys with a view towards making statistical inferences about the population being studied; such inferences depend strongly on the survey questions used. Polls about public opinion, public-health surveys, market-research surveys, government surveys and censuses all exemplify quantitative research that uses survey methodology to answer questions about a population. Although censuses do not include a \\"sample\\", they do include other aspects of survey methodology, like questionnaires, interviewers, and non-response follow-up techniques. Surveys provide important information for all kinds of public-information and research fields, such as marketing research, psychology, health-care provision and sociology. Overview A single survey is made of at least a sample (or full population in the case of a census), a method of data collection (e.g., a questionnaire) and individual questions or items that become data that can be analyzed statistically. A single survey may focus on different types of topics such as preferences (e.g., for a presidential candidate), opinions (e.g., should abortion be legal?), behavior (smoking and alcohol use), or factual information (e.g., income), depending on its purpose. Since survey research is almost always based on a sample of the population, the success of the research is dependent on the representativeness of the sample with respect to a target population of interest to the researcher. That target population can range from the general population of a given country to specific groups of people within that country, to a membership list of a professional organization, or list of students enrolled in a school system (see also sampling (statistics) and survey sampling). The persons replying to a survey are called respondents, and depending on the questions asked their answers may represent themselves as individuals, their households, employers, or other organization they represent. Survey methodology as a scientific field seeks to identify principles about the sample design, data collection instruments, statistical adjustment of data, and data processing, and final data analysis that can create systematic and random survey errors. Survey errors are sometimes analyzed in connection with survey cost. Cost constraints are sometimes framed as improving quality within cost constraints, or alternatively, reducing costs for a fixed level of quality. Survey methodology is both a scientific field and a profession, meaning that some professionals in the field focus on survey errors empirically and others design surveys to reduce them. For survey designers, the task involves making a large set of decisions about thousands of individual features of a survey in order to improve it. The most important methodological challenges of a survey methodologist include making decisions on how to: * Identify and select potential sample members. * Contact sampled individuals and collect data from those who are hard to reach (or reluctant to respond) * Evaluate and test questions. * Select the mode for posing questions and collecting responses. * Train and supervise interviewers (if they are involved). * Check data files for accuracy and internal consistency. * Adjust survey estimates to correct for identified errors. Selecting samples The sample is chosen from the sampling frame, which consists of a list of all members of the population of interest. The goal of a survey is not to describe the sample, but the larger population. This generalizing ability is dependent on the representativeness of the sample, as stated above. Each member of the population is termed an element. There are frequent difficulties one encounters while choosing a representative sample. One common error that results is selection bias. Selection bias results when the procedures used to select a sample result in over representation or under representation of some significant aspect of the population. For instance, if the population of interest consists of 75% females, and 25% males, and the sample consists of 40% females and 60% males, females are under represented while males are overrepresented. In order to minimize selection biases, stratified random sampling is often used. This is when the population is divided into sub- populations called strata, and random samples are drawn from each of the strata, or elements are drawn for the sample on a proportional basis. Modes of data collection There are several ways of administering a survey. The choice between administration modes is influenced by several factors, including # costs, # coverage of the target population, # flexibility of asking questions, # respondents' willingness to participate and # response accuracy. Different methods create mode effects that change how respondents answer, and different methods have different advantages. The most common modes of administration can be summarized as:Mellenbergh, G.J. (2008). Chapter 9: Surveys. In H.J. Adèr & G.J. Mellenbergh (Eds.) (with contributions by D.J. Hand), Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion (pp. 183–209).

Research designs There are several different designs, or overall structures, that can be used in survey research. The three general types are cross-sectional, successive independent samples, and longitudinal studies. =Cross-sectional studies= In cross-sectional studies, a sample (or samples) is drawn from the relevant population and studied once. A cross-sectional study describes characteristics of that population at one time, but cannot give any insight as to the causes of population characteristics because it is a predictive, correlational design. =Successive independent samples studies= A successive independent samples design draws multiple random samples from a population at one or more times. This design can study changes within a population, but not changes within individuals because the same individuals are not surveyed more than once. Such studies cannot, therefore, identify the causes of change over time necessarily. For successive independent samples designs to be effective, the samples must be drawn from the same population, and must be equally representative of it. If the samples are not comparable, the changes between samples may be due to demographic characteristics rather than time. In addition, the questions must be asked in the same way so that responses can be compared directly. =Longitudinal studies= Longitudinal studies take measure of the same random sample at multiple time points. Unlike with a successive independent samples design, this design measures the differences in individual participants’ responses over time. This means that a researcher can potentially assess the reasons for response changes by assessing the differences in respondents’ experiences. Longitudinal studies are the easiest way to assess the effect of a naturally occurring event, such as divorce that cannot be tested experimentally. However, longitudinal studies are both expensive and difficult to do. It's harder to find a sample that will commit to a months- or years-long study than a 15-minute interview, and participants frequently leave the study before the final assessment. This attrition of participants is not random, so samples can become less representative with successive assessments. To account for this, a researcher can compare the respondents who left the survey to those that did not, to see if they are statistically different populations. Respondents may also try to be self- consistent in spite of changes to survey answers. Questionnaires A basic questionnaire in the Thai language Questionnaires are the most commonly used tool in survey research. However, the results of a particular survey are worthless if the questionnaire is written inadequately. Questionnaires should produce valid and reliable demographic variable measures and should yield valid and reliable individual disparities that self-report scales generate. =Questionnaires as tools= A variable category that is often measured in survey research are demographic variables, which are used to depict the characteristics of the people surveyed in the sample. Demographic variables include such measures as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, race, and age. Surveys often assess the preferences and attitudes of individuals, and many employ self-report scales to measure people's opinions and judgements about different items presented on a scale. Self-report scales are also used to examine the disparities among people on scale items. These self-report scales, which are usually presented in questionnaire form, are one of the most used instruments in psychology, and thus it is important that the measures be constructed carefully, while also being reliable and valid. =Reliability and validity of self-report measures= Reliable measures of self-report are defined by their consistency. Thus, a reliable self-report measure produces consistent results every time it is executed. A test's reliability can be measured a few ways. First, one can calculate a test-retest reliability. A test-retest reliability entails conducting the same questionnaire to a large sample at two different times. For the questionnaire to be considered reliable, people in the sample do not have to score identically on each test, but rather their position in the score distribution should be similar for both the test and the retest. Self-report measures will generally be more reliable when they have many items measuring a construct. Furthermore, measurements will be more reliable when the factor being measured has greater variability among the individuals in the sample that are being tested. Finally, there will be greater reliability when instructions for the completion of the questionnaire are clear and when there are limited distractions in the testing environment. Contrastingly, a questionnaire is valid if what it measures is what it had originally planned to measure. Construct validity of a measure is the degree to which it measures the theoretical construct that it was originally supposed to measure. =Composing a questionnaire= Six steps can be employed to construct a questionnaire that will produce reliable and valid results. First, one must decide what kind of information should be collected. Second, one must decide how to conduct the questionnaire. Thirdly, one must construct a first draft of the questionnaire. Fourth, the questionnaire should be revised. Next, the questionnaire should be pretested. Finally, the questionnaire should be edited and the procedures for its use should be specified. =Guidelines for the effective wording of questions= The way that a question is phrased can have a large impact on how a research participant will answer the question. Thus, survey researchers must be conscious of their wording when writing survey questions. It is important for researchers to keep in mind that different individuals, cultures, and subcultures can interpret certain words and phrases differently from one another. There are two different types of questions that survey researchers use when writing a questionnaire: free response questions and closed questions. Free response questions are open-ended, whereas closed questions are usually multiple choice. Free response questions are beneficial because they allow the responder greater flexibility, but they are also very difficult to record and score, requiring extensive coding. Contrastingly, closed questions can be scored and coded more easily, but they diminish expressivity and spontaneity of the responder. In general, the vocabulary of the questions should be very simple and direct, and most should be less than twenty words. Each question should be edited for \\"readability\\" and should avoid leading or loaded questions. Finally, if multiple items are being used to measure one construct, the wording of some of the items should be worded in the opposite direction to evade response bias. A respondent's answer to an open-ended question can be coded into a response scale afterwards, or analysed using more qualitative methods. =Order of questions= Survey researchers should carefully construct the order of questions in a questionnaire. For questionnaires that are self-administered, the most interesting questions should be at the beginning of the questionnaire to catch the respondent's attention, while demographic questions should be near the end. Contrastingly, if a survey is being administered over the telephone or in person, demographic questions should be administered at the beginning of the interview to boost the respondent's confidence. Another reason to be mindful of question order may cause a survey response effect in which one question may affect how people respond to subsequent questions as a result of priming. Nonresponse reduction The following ways have been recommended for reducing nonresponseLynn, P. (2008) \\"The problem of non-response\\", chapter 3, 35-55, in International Handbook of Survey Methodology (ed.s Edith de Leeuw, Joop Hox & Don A. Dillman). Erlbaum. in telephone and face-to-face surveys:Dillman, D.A. (1978) Mail and telephone surveys: The total design method. Wiley. * Advance letter. A short letter is sent in advance to inform the sampled respondents about the upcoming survey. The style of the letter should be personalized but not overdone. First, it announces that a phone call will be made, or an interviewer wants to make an appointment to do the survey face-to-face. Second, the research topic will be described. Last, it allows both an expression of the surveyor's appreciation of cooperation and an opening to ask questions on the survey. * Training. The interviewers are thoroughly trained in how to ask respondents questions, how to work with computers and making schedules for callbacks to respondents who were not reached. * Short introduction. The interviewer should always start with a short introduction about him or herself. She/he should give her name, the institute she is working for, the length of the interview and goal of the interview. Also it can be useful to make clear that you are not selling anything: this has been shown to lead to a slightly higher responding rate.De Leeuw, E.D. (2001). \\"I am not selling anything: Experiments in telephone introductions\\". Kwantitatieve Methoden, 22, 41–48. * Respondent-friendly survey questionnaire. The questions asked must be clear, non-offensive and easy to respond to for the subjects under study. Brevity is also often cited as increasing response rate. A 1996 literature review found mixed evidence to support this claim for both written and verbal surveys, concluding that other factors may often be more important. A 2010 study looking at 100,000 online surveys found response rate dropped by about 3% at 10 questions and about 6% at 20 questions, with drop-off slowing (for example, only 10% reduction at 40 questions). Other studies showed that quality of response degraded toward the end of long surveys. Interviewer effects Survey methodologists have devoted much effort to determining the extent to which interviewee responses are affected by physical characteristics of the interviewer. Main interviewer traits that have been demonstrated to influence survey responses are race, gender, and relative body weight (BMI). These interviewer effects are particularly operant when questions are related to the interviewer trait. Hence, race of interviewer has been shown to affect responses to measures regarding racial attitudes, interviewer sex responses to questions involving gender issues, and interviewer BMI answers to eating and dieting-related questions. While interviewer effects have been investigated mainly for face-to-face surveys, they have also been shown to exist for interview modes with no visual contact, such as telephone surveys and in video-enhanced web surveys. The explanation typically provided for interviewer effects is social desirability bias: survey participants may attempt to project a positive self-image in an effort to conform to the norms they attribute to the interviewer asking questions. Interviewer effects are one example survey response effects.

Examples include the provision of colour in a black and white television system or the provision of stereo in a monophonic radio broadcast. There is no physical difference between a carrier and a subcarrier; the \\"sub\\" implies that it has been derived from a carrier, which has been amplitude modulated by a steady signal and has a constant frequency relation to it. FM stereo Stereo broadcasting is made possible by using a subcarrier on FM radio stations, which takes the left channel and \\"subtracts\\" the right channel from it -- essentially by hooking up the right- channel wires backward (reversing polarity) and then joining left and reversed-right. The result is modulated with suppressed carrier AM, more correctly called sum and difference modulation or SDM, at 38 kHz in the FM signal, which is joined at 2% modulation with the mono left+right audio (which ranges 50 Hz ~ 15 kHz). A 19 kHz pilot tone is also added at a 9% modulation to trigger radios to decode the stereo subcarrier, making FM stereo fully compatible with mono. Once the receiver demodulates the L+R and L−R signals, it adds the two signals ([L+R] + [L−R] = 2L) to get the left channel and subtracts ([L+R] − [L−R] = 2R) to get the right channel. Rather than having a local oscillator, the 19 kHz pilot tone provides an in-phase reference signal used to reconstruct the missing carrier wave from the 38 kHz signal. For AM broadcasting, different analog (AM stereo) and digital (HD Radio) methods are used to produce stereophonic audio. Modulated subcarriers of the type used in FM broadcasting are impractical for AM broadcast due to the relatively narrow signal bandwidth allocated for a given AM signal. On standard AM broadcast radios, the entire 9 kHz to 10 kHz allocated bandwidth of the AM signal may be used for audio. Television Likewise, analog TV signals are transmitted with the black and white luminance part as the main signal, and the color chrominance as the subcarriers. A black and white TV simply ignores the extra information, as it has no decoder for it. To reduce the bandwidth of the color subcarriers, they are filtered to remove higher frequencies. This is made possible by the fact that the human eye sees much more detail in contrast than in color. In addition, only blue and red are transmitted, with green being determined by subtracting the other two from the luminance and taking the remainder. (See: YIQ, YCbCr, YPbPr) Various broadcast television systems use different subcarrier frequencies, in addition to differences in encoding. For the audio part, MTS uses subcarriers on the video that can also carry three audio channels, including one for stereo (same left-minus-right method as for FM), another for second audio programs (such as descriptive video service for the vision-impaired, and bilingual programs), and yet a third hidden one for the studio to communicate with reporters or technicians in the field (or for a technician or broadcast engineer at a remote transmitter site to talk back to the studio), or any other use a TV station might see fit. (See also NICAM, A2 Stereo.) In RF-transmitted composite video, subcarriers remain in the baseband signal after main carrier demodulation to be separated in the receiver. The mono audio component of the transmitted signal is in a separate carrier and not integral to the video component. In wired video connections, composite video retains the integrated subcarrier signal structure found in the transmitted baseband signal, while S-Video places the chrominance and luminance signals on separate wires to eliminate subcarrier crosstalk and enhance the signal bandwidth and strength (picture sharpness and brightness). Private audio Before satellite, Muzak and similar services were transmitted to department stores on FM subcarriers. The fidelity of the subcarrier audio was limited compared to the primary FM radio audio channel. The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also allowed betting parlors in New York state to get horse racing results from the state gaming commission via the same technology. Many non-commercial educational FM stations in the US (especially public radio stations affiliated with NPR) broadcast a radio reading service for the blind, which reads articles in local newspapers and sometimes magazines. The vision-impaired can request a special radio, permanently tuned to receive audio on a particular subcarrier frequency (usually 67 kHz or 92 kHz), from a particular FM station. Services like these and others on broadcast FM subcarriers are referred to as a Subsidiary Communications Authority (SCA) service by the FCC in the United States, and as Subsidiary Communications Multiplex Operations (SCMO) by the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in Canada. Datacasting Subcarries in the OFDMA scheme The RDS/RBDS subcarrier (57 kHz) allows FM radios to display what station they are on, pick another frequency on the same network or with the same format, scroll brief messages like station slogans, news, weather, or traffic—even activate pagers or remote billboards. It can also broadcast EAS messages, and has a station \\"format\\" name ALERT to automatically trigger radios to tune in for emergency info, even if a CD is playing. While it never really caught on in North America, European stations frequently rely on this system.The radio station Heart FM used this service to cause people's radio sets to switch over to adverts for commercial vehicles during the morning and evening rush hours An upgraded version is built into digital radio. xRDS is a system with which broadcasters can multiply the speed of data transmission in the FM channel by using further normal RDS subcarriers, shifted into the higher frequencies of the FM multiplex. The extra RDS subcarriers are placed in the upper empty part of the multiplex spectrum and carry the extra data payload. xRDS has no fixed frequencies for the additional 57 kHz carriers. Until 2012, MSN Direct used subcarriers to transmit traffic, gas prices, movie times, weather and other information to GPS navigation devices, wristwatches, and other devices. Many of the subcarriers were from stations owned by Clear Channel. The technology was known as DirectBand. FMeXtra on FM uses dozens of small COFDM subcarriers to transmit digital radio in a fully in-band on-channel manner. Removing other analog subcarriers (such as stereo) increases either the audio quality or channels available, the latter making it possible to send non-audio metadata along with it, such as album covers, song lyrics, artist info, concert data, and more. Telemetry and foldback Many stations use subcarriers for internal purposes, such as getting telemetry back from a remote transmitter, often located in a difficult-to-access area at the top of a mountain. A station's engineer can carry a decoder around with him and know anything that's wrong, as long as the station is on the air and he is within range. This is the essence of a wireless transmitter/studio link. On wireless studio/transmitter links (STLs), not only are the broadcast station's subcarriers transmitted, but other remote control commands as well. Interruptible foldback, such as for remote broadcasting, is also possible over subcarriers, though its role is limited. MCPC satellites Analog satellite television and terrestrial analog microwave relay communications rely on subcarriers transmitted with the video carrier on a satellite transponder or microwave channel for the audio channels of a video feed. There are usually at frequencies of 5.8, 6.2, or 6.8 MHz (the video carrier usually resides below 5 MHz on a satellite transponder or microwave relay). Extra subcarriers are sometimes transmitted at around 7 or 8 MHz for extra audio (such as radio stations) or low-to-medium-speed data. This is referred to as multiple channel per carrier (MCPC). This is now mostly superseded by digital TV (usually DVB-S, DVB-S2 or another MPEG-2-based system), where audio and video data are packaged together (multiplexed) in a single MPEG transport stream.

He served from 1965 to 1971 as a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and from 1971 to 1981 as a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate representing the state's 50th district. Dwyer then served as the 30th Treasurer of Pennsylvania from January 20, 1981, to January 22, 1987, when he committed suicide during a live press conference. In the early 1980s, Pennsylvania discovered its state workers had overpaid federal taxes due to errors in state withholding prior to Dwyer's administration. A multi-million-dollar recovery contract was required to determine the compensation to be given to each employee. In 1986, Dwyer was convicted for accepting a bribe from the California firm that won the contract. He was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury, and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and was scheduled to be sentenced on January 23, 1987. On January 22, Dwyer called a news conference in the Pennsylvania state capital of Harrisburg where he fatally shot himself with a .357 Magnum revolver in front of reporters. Dwyer's suicide was broadcast later that day to a wide television audience across Pennsylvania. Throughout Dwyer's trial and after his conviction, Dwyer maintained that he was not guilty of the charges for which he was convicted, and that his conviction resulted from political persecution. In 2010, the prosecution's main witness, William Trickett Smith, maintained that his testimony at Dwyer's 1986 trial—in which he stated that he offered Dwyer a bribe, and that Dwyer accepted this offer—was truthful, and that he had committed perjury at his own 1985 trial when he denied offering Dwyer a bribe (and instead stated that it was John Torquato, Jr. who offered Dwyer the bribe). Moreover, Smith admitted in October 1984—the year before his own trial—that he offered Dwyer a bribe, which Dwyer accepted. In 2010, former U.S. Attorney James West, who prosecuted Dwyer, affirmed Dwyer's guilt, stating that \\"the evidence against Dwyer was overwhelming and indisputable\\". All posthumous appeals made by Dwyer's lawyers on Dwyer's behalf were denied, and his convictions were upheld. Early life and education Dwyer with his family R. Budd Dwyer was born on November 21, 1939 in St. Charles, Missouri. Dwyer graduated in 1961 with an A.B. in Political Science and Accounting from Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he was a member of the Beta Chi chapter of Theta Chi Fraternity. After earning a master's degree in education in 1963, he taught social studies and coached football at Cambridge Springs High School. Career Dwyer in the 1970s, with U.S. President Gerald Ford A Republican, Dwyer became active in politics. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 6th district (although seats were apportioned by county before 1969) in 1964 and was reelected in 1966 and 1968. In 1970, while still a sitting State Representative, Dwyer ran for a seat in the Pennsylvania State Senate from its 50th district and won. Shortly after his victory he resigned his seat in the State House and was sworn in as Senator in January 1971. After being elected to additional terms in 1974 and 1978, Dwyer decided to try for a state office and in 1980 ran for and won the office of Pennsylvania Treasurer that had been held by Robert E. Casey since 1976. He ran for a second and last term in 1984 and won reelection to the seat. =Bribery investigation and conviction= From 1979 to 1981, before Dwyer was state treasurer, public employees of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania overpaid millions of dollars in Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes (FICA). As a result, the state required an accounting firm to determine refunds for its employees. The no-bid US$4.6 million contract was awarded to Computer Technology Associates (CTA), a California-based firm, owned by John Torquato, Jr, a native of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in May 1984. In June 1984 the Office of the Pennsylvania Auditor General informed the FBI of bribery that occurred during the awarding of the contract. Upon learning that the FBI was investigating the circumstances of the awarding of the CTA contract, it was cancelled by Dwyer on July 11, 1984. An investigation was undertaken by federal prosecutors. Dwyer repeatedly tried to stop, divert and forestall this investigation, stating that the US attorney had neither the authority nor evidence to pursue prosecution. Dwyer later admitted to telling his staff to withhold request for proposal (RFP) information from the U.S. Attorney and the FBI during the investigation. Dwyer was finally charged with agreeing to receive a kickback of $300,000 in return for awarding CTA the contract. Prior to Dwyer's indictment, The U.S. Attorney indicted Torquato, Torquato's attorney William T. Smith, and Smith's wife. At Smith's 1985 trial, Smith testified that Torquato offered Dwyer a campaign contribution in return for the CTA contract, yet Dwyer rejected Torquato's offer. In contrast, Torquato testified that it was Smith who offered Dwyer $300,000 in return for the CTA contract. Dwyer, acting as a defense witness for Smith at Smith's trial, denied that he was offered any contribution at all. However, prior to Smith's trial, on October 27, 1984 (four days after Smith's indictment), Smith confessed to offering Dwyer a bribe, and stated that Dwyer accepted this offer. However, Bob Asher, the then Republican Party Chairman for the State of Pennsylvania, objected to this, and requested that the $300 000 be directed entirely to the Republican State Committee, since Asher \\"did not want Dwyer to go to jail\\". Dwyer, along with Asher, were indicted by a federal grand jury on May 13, 1986. In the hopes of reducing his twelve year sentence stemming from his 1985 conviction, Smith testified on behalf of the federal government against Dwyer and Asher at their 1986 trial. Ultimately, Smith did not receive any reduction in his sentence for testifying against Dwyer (although his wife, Judy Smith, was granted immunity from prosecution). It was revealed at Dwyer's trial that he sought and won approval for special legislation—Act 38 of 1984 (House Bill 1397)—that authorized him to recover the FICA overpayments, and that coded computer tape seized from CTA's office in July 1984 showed that Dwyer was to receive a $300,000 pay-off for awarding CTA the contract. Moreover, Smith and Torquato's claims about Dwyer being bribed were corroborated by four independent and impartial witnesses. and Smith's testimony against Dwyer was virtually identical to written statements Smith made long before entering into a plea agreement. Additionally, FBI agents testified that Dwyer attempted to conceal his involvement in the scheme when, after learning of the FBI investigation, he erased the entry in his appointment book of the meeting with Torquato and Smith in which he was first offered a bribe. Dwyer maintained that he awarded CTA the contract on the basis of his treasury task force recommendation, yet this conflicted with the fact that Dwyer personally handled all matters relating to the contract six days prior to awarding it to CTA. Furthermore, his task force's contribution merely consisted in the making of a single phone call to David I. Herbert (the former State Director for Social Security, who controlled FICA recovery for Pennsylvania's public employees, and who was subsequently convicted for conspiring with CTA). Dwyer awarded the contract to CTA—an obscure California firm with three employees, little equipment, and little experience—despite being informed in May 1984 by the major Pennsylvania-based accounting firm Arthur Young and Associates (who had two-hundred-and-fifty employees and submitted a proposal eight days prior to CTA's proposal) that they could perform the FICA recovery as fast as CTA for half the cost. Charles Collins, Arthur Young's former director of Management Consulting in Pittsburgh, testified at Dwyer's trial that Arthur Young and Associates, who unlike CTA had experience in identical tax recovery work, was prepared to negotiate the FICA recovery contract (that was half the cost of the CTA contract) and that Dwyer was clearly aware of Arthur Young's position before committing the contract to CTA. Additionally, sixteen other competitors were willing to be considered for the FICA recovery contract and many had communicated with Treasurer Dwyer's office to request an opportunity to bid on the contract, yet Dwyer did not respond. Dwyer repeatedly stated that he awarded the contract to CTA (via his task force's recommendation) on the basis of CTA's providing \\"immediate credit\\", yet the contract between CTA and Dwyer contained no information regarding CTA's ability to provide such credit. Moreover, Dwyer admitted that he did not mention the concept of \\"immediate credit\\" to Arthur Young and Associates when officials from the firm asked why CTA was chosen over them.In contradiction to Dwyer's statements about awarding CTA the contact on the basis of their providing \\"immediate credit\\", Arthur Young and Associates were told that CTA got the contract since they first recognized that the overpayments could be recovered, and that they supported legislation that gave Dwyer the sole power to award the contract. Nevertheless, Dwyer denied any wrongdoing, stating that after the CTA contract was signed, Smith merely made a \\"generic\\" offer to help him with his campaign. Dwyer's lawyer spoke to the prosecutor, acting U.S. Attorney West, asking him if he would drop all charges against Dwyer if Dwyer resigned as state treasurer. West declined the offer. He instead offered to let Dwyer plead guilty to a single charge of bribe receiving, which would have meant up to a maximum of five years' imprisonment, as long as he resigned from his office as Treasurer of Pennsylvania and cooperated fully with the government's investigation, but Dwyer refused and went to trial. At his trial, Dwyer did not take the stand, and his lawyer, Paul Killion, presented no defense witnesses since he thought that the government did not sufficiently prove its case. It is possible that Dwyer did not testify in his own defense since he did not want to be questioned regarding his involvement in a 1980 conspiracy involving his wife's business \\"Poli-Ed,\\" and two Pennsylvania State Education Association (PSEA) employees. One of these employees was Dwyer's close friend and campaign manager Fred Mckillop, who was subsequently fired by the PSEA for his involvement in the scheme, and who later featured in a 2010 documentary about Dwyer. In this conspiracy, which was investigated by the office of the Pennsylvania Attorney General, Dwyer allegedly siphoned money from his campaign into his personal funds.Observer-Reporter, August 30, 1984 On December 18, 1986, Dwyer was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and consequently faced a sentence of up to 55 years imprisonment and a $300,000 fine. His sentencing was scheduled for January 23, 1987, to be performed by U.S. District Court Judge Malcolm Muir. One mail-fraud charge against Dwyer was dismissed by Judge Muir. One juror, Carolyn Edwards of Williamsport, found it emotionally difficult to convict Dwyer (and Asher) since they were men of \\"very high integrity ... they just made a mistake\\". Bob Asher, Dwyer's co- defendant, was sentenced to one year in jail. He later returned to politics and served as a Republican national committeeman for Pennsylvania. =Dwyer's status as state treasurer= Pennsylvania law stated that Dwyer could not officially be removed from office until his sentencing in January. Given this, Dwyer stated that until his legal appeal was resolved, he would stay on as Treasurer under leave of absence without pay and would not resign before having the opportunity to appeal his conviction. In the interim, the treasury department would be run by Deputy Treasurer Donald L. Johnson. Dwyer continued to profess his innocence after being convicted, as did others close to him. On December 23, he wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan seeking a presidential pardon, and to Senator Arlen Specter seeking support in this effort. The week of Dwyer's sentencing, Pennsylvania State Attorney General LeRoy Zimmerman and state prosecutors were investigating a provision of the Pennsylvania state constitution where removal of a civil worker from office who has been convicted of a crime is \\"self-executing\\", thus, automatic upon that person's sentencing. A decision confirming this constitutional point was expected on January 22, the day before Dwyer's sentencing hearing. Public suicide In a meeting in his home, Dwyer discussed the idea of a press conference with his press secretary James \\"Duke\\" Horshock (1939-2020) and Deputy Treasurer Don Johnson, on January 15, 1987. At the time, Johnson cautioned Dwyer not to use such a forum to attack the governor or other individuals involved with his criminal conviction, and Dwyer assured him that he would not do so. Both men left assuming Dwyer would ultimately resign if the press conference were held. Dwyer finally reached Senator Specter by telephone on January 21, two days before his sentencing. A Specter aide stated that the two of them talked for 8 to 10 minutes. Following up on his letter to the senator asking for help, he personally wrote to President Ronald Reagan asking for a presidential pardon. In his letter, Dwyer once again professed his innocence and stated that the concept of immediate credit was not understood by the uneducated, unsophisticated \\"rural\\" jury at his trial. The senator responded that this request to President Reagan was \\"not realistic\\" because the judicial process, including appeals, had not yet run its course. On the same day, Dwyer asked his press secretary Horshock and deputy press secretary Gregory Penny to set up a news conference for the next day without telling them what he was to discuss. Horshock arranged the press conference for 10:30 a.m. EST the next day, January 22. The press secretary called dozens of reporters asking them to attend, and told them he did not know its subject. Initially, Dwyer wanted to ban certain reporters from the press conference who he believed wrote biased accounts about him and even suggested that a guard should be in attendance to prevent entry to those who were not on his authorized list. Horshock, who was unconvinced about Dwyer's claims that he was being conspired against, objected, stating to Dwyer that he could not \\"use state government facilities to manipulate the free flow of information\\". Leading up to the press conference, acting U.S. Attorney West, who had secured the conviction against Dwyer, remarked that the Treasurer's resignation \\"sounds like the appropriate thing to do under the circumstances. It seems like it would save everybody a lot of time and aggravation.\\" Similarly, Harrisburg Patriot-News reporter Kenn Marshall described the consensus among reporters: they would be attending to see Dwyer announce his resignation from office. \\"My mission was to stay there until he said those words, then call in a new top for our story.\\" The night before the press conference, Dwyer wrote the following note: =Dwyer's press statement= The next morning, Dwyer went to his press conference as planned. Appearing nervous and agitated, he again professed his innocence and began reading from a 21-page prepared text later described as a \\"rambling polemic about the criminal justice system\\". It singled out former Governor Thornburgh, Acting U.S. Attorney West, agents in the FBI, Judge Muir, and others for tarnishing the justice system and ruining him. Dwyer stated that Attorney West purposely had Dwyer's trial not in Harrisburg but in Williamsport, since in Williamsport the jury pool was the most uneducated in the state of Pennsylvania. Dwyer spoke out against the death penalty and expressed regret for voting in favor of it while he was in the Pennsylvania assembly. This speech lasted nearly 30 minutes, and approximately halfway into it, with no apparent end in sight, some of the gathered press began to pack up and leave. Dwyer spotted this and interrupted himself to say, \\"Those of you who are putting your cameras away, I think you ought to stay because we're not, we're not finished yet.\\" Given the inflammatory nature of portions of Dwyer's text, press secretary Horshock had considered interrupting him outright to stop him but concluded that he would hold his own press conference after Dwyer's. \\"I had to make it known that I was not aware of the content of the statement. I didn't want it to be thought that I wrote that for him.\\" Upon reaching the final page of his statement, which had not been distributed to the press nor press secretary Horshock in advance, Dwyer paused. \\"...and I'm on the last page now, and I don't have enough to pass out, but Duke [Horshock], I'll leave this here, and you can make copies for the people; there's a few extra copies here right now.\\" Dwyer continued, At this point, Dwyer stopped reading from his prepared remarks, with the gathered press still waiting on his expected resignation. There was still a significant portion remaining, which detailed what he was actually planning to do, and it read as follows: After deciding to break from his speech, Dwyer called to three of his staffers, giving each a sealed envelope with the insignia of the treasury department. The first envelope, given to Bob Holste, contained a letter addressed to then-Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey, who had taken office just two days earlier. The second, given to deputy press secretary Gregory Penny, contained an organ donor card and other related materials. The last, given to Deputy Treasurer Don Johnson, contained materials intended for Dwyer's family, including three letters: one for his wife Joanne, and one for each of his children, Rob and DeeDee (Dyan), and suggested funeral arrangements. Freelance photographer Gary Miller, one of the reporters in attendance, described the scene at this point, stating: \\"It was just kind of a long-winded, sad event.\\" =Suicide= A video still showing Dwyer holding a .357 Magnum revolver, a few seconds before the shooting After he had finished speaking and handing out the notes to his staffers, Dwyer then produced a manila envelope with either a Smith & Wesson Model 27 or Model 19 .357 Magnum revolver in it. When the crowd in the room saw what Dwyer had pulled out of the envelope, the mood changed immediately from one of waiting to see whether he would resign his office to one of panic as nobody knew what he was planning to do with the gun. People gasped, and Dwyer backed up against the wall, holding the weapon close to his body. Dwyer calmly stated to his audience, \\"Please, please leave the room if this will ... if this will affect you.\\" Some people in the room left to call for help. Among those who stayed, some pleaded with Dwyer to surrender the gun while others tried to approach him and seize the weapon. Dwyer warned against either action, exclaiming in his final words, \\"Don't, don't, don't, this will hurt someone. Sit down.” A moment later, Dwyer quickly fired one shot through the roof of his mouth and into his brain, and collapsed to the floor, dead. Five news cameras recorded the events. One of the cameras remained focused on Dwyer and captured close up footage of the aftermath of the shooting; as his body slumped, blood streamed from the exit wound in the back of his head as well as from his nostrils and mouth. Horshock took the podium and asked the media to leave and for someone to call for medical assistance and the police. Dwyer died instantly from the gunshot shortly before 11:00 a.m. EST but was not pronounced dead until 11:31 a.m. An aide later stated that Dwyer's corneas were made available for transplant per his organ donation wishes, but that no other organs were usable by the time his body reached a hospital. =Graphic footage and television media= Many television stations throughout Pennsylvania broadcast taped footage of Dwyer's suicide to a midday audience. Philadelphia station WPVI (Channel 6) showed Dwyer pulling the trigger and falling backwards, but did not show the bullet path. Over the next several hours, news editors had to decide how much of the graphic footage to air. Many chose not to air the final moments of the suicide and WPVI also chose not to show the gunshot a second time. Many stations, including WCAU and Pennsylvania's Group W stations KYW and KDKA, froze the action just before the gunshot. However, the latter two allowed the audio of the shooting to continue under the frozen image. Group W's news cameraman William L. \\"Bill\\" Martin and reporter David Sollenberger had a camera set up at the conference. They chose to air the audio with a freeze-frame of the gun in Dwyer's mouth. Only a handful aired the unedited press conference. WPVI in Philadelphia re-broadcast the suicide footage in full on their 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. Action News broadcast without warning the viewers. That station's broadcast is a source for copies circulating on the Internet. WPXI in Pittsburgh is reported by the Associated Press to have broadcast the footage uncensored on an early newscast. In explaining the decision to air, WPXI operations manager By Williams said, \\"It's an important event [about] an important man.\\" Williams avoided airing the footage in the evening newscasts, explaining, \\"Everyone knows by then that he did it. There are children out of school.\\" However, in central Pennsylvania, many children were home from school during the day of Dwyer's suicide due to a snowstorm. Harrisburg TV station WHTM-TV opted to broadcast uncut video of the suicide twice that day, defending the decision (despite hundreds of viewer complaints afterward) due to the important nature of the story. Many older students reacted to the event by creating black comedy jokes similar to those that circulated after the Challenger disaster. A study of the incidence of the jokes showed that they were told only in areas where stations showed uncensored footage of the press conference. At least one reporter present at Dwyer's suicide suffered from being a witness. Tony Romeo, a radio reporter, was standing a few feet from Dwyer. After the suicide, Romeo developed depression and took a break from journalism. =Letter to Governor Bob Casey= Dwyer's deep mistrust of outgoing Republican Governor Thornburgh was spelled out in detail in his press conference statement. The timing of Dwyer's press conference and suicide meant that Thornburgh was not empowered to appoint a Treasurer to replace him. Instead, this fell to Thornburgh's successor, Democrat Bob Casey, who had taken office on January 20. The letter Dwyer had sent to Casey stated, among other things, \\"By the time you receive this letter ... the office of State Treasurer of Pennsylvania will be vacant. I stress to you that I did not resign but was State Treasurer of Pennsylvania to the end.\\" It also stated that Casey \\"will be the great Governor that Pennsylvania needs at this time in our history.\\" He suggested his wife Joanne as his successor, describing her as \\"very talented, personable, organized and hard-working.\\" Governor Casey did not take Dwyer's suggestion. Regardless of the events of January 22, the governor and legislature of Pennsylvania already expected Dwyer to either resign or be removed from office. As such, a deal had already been brokered wherein the next treasurer, a Democrat, would serve out Dwyer's term and step down at its end. This was G. Davis Greene Jr., who was appointed as the 31st Treasurer of Pennsylvania on January 23, 1987, the day after Dwyer's suicide. =Response to allegations made by Dwyer in his final press statement= Following Dwyer's public suicide, the National Association of State Treasurers called for Dwyer's allegations (contained in his final press statement) to be reviewed by the United States Department of Justice. After a thorough investigation, the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility cleared attorney James West and everyone else involved in Dwyer's investigation and prosecution, of any wrongdoing. The FBI also investigated Dwyer's claims regarding impropriety on behalf of FBI personnel. They ultimately found Dwyer's claims to be \\"lacking in substance and specificity\\" and warranting no further action. =Death benefits= Since Dwyer died in office, his widow Joanne was able to collect full survivor benefits totaling over $1.28 million, which at the time was the largest death benefit payment ever made by the state system. If Dwyer had been sentenced, state law would have prohibited the payment of his state-provided pension benefits. A spokesman for Dwyer suggested that he may have killed himself to preserve the pension benefits for his family, whose finances had been ruined by legal defense costs. Other statements made by friends and family also suggest that this was Dwyer's motivation. Appeals On January 27, 1987, Dwyer's lawyers filed an appeal in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking the dismissal of all post-trial motions that were then pending against Dwyer, abatement of Dwyer's conviction and the dismissal of his May 13, 1986 indictment. On March 5, 1987, the district court denied all motions, and ordered to \\"close this file as to R. Budd Dwyer.\\" Dwyer's lawyers appealed this decision, and The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit subsequently vacated the judgement. On remand, the district court was instructed to dismiss Dwyer's motions (since the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction) and Dwyer's convictions for mail fraud and conspiracy were upheld. Six years after Dwyer's death, efforts were made to clear Dwyer's name when a retrial request was filed in U.S. District Court in July 1993. This request was denied in October of the same year.

The poem, written in some 7,400 dactylic hexameters, is divided into six untitled books, and explores Epicurean physics through poetic language and metaphors.Greenblatt (2011). Namely, Lucretius explores the principles of atomism; the nature of the mind and soul; explanations of sensation and thought; the development of the world and its phenomena; and explains a variety of celestial and terrestrial phenomena. The universe described in the poem operates according to these physical principles, guided by fortuna (\\"chance\\"),In particular, De rerum natura 5.107 (fortuna gubernans, \\"guiding chance\\" or \\"fortune at the helm\\"). See: Gale (1996) [1994], pp. 213, 22324. and not the divine intervention of the traditional Roman deities. Background De rerum natura was written by the Roman poet Lucretius. To the Greek philosopher Epicurus, the unhappiness and degradation of humans arose largely from the dread which they entertained of the power of the deities, from terror of their wrath. This wrath was supposed to be displayed by the misfortunes inflicted in this life and by the everlasting tortures that were the lot of the guilty in a future state (or, where these feelings were not strongly developed, from a vague dread of gloom and misery after death). Epicurus thus made it his mission to remove these fears, and thus to establish tranquility in the minds of his readers. To do this, Epicurus invoked the atomism of Democritus to demonstrate that the material universe was formed not by a Supreme Being, but by the mixing of elemental particles that had existed from all eternity governed by certain simple laws. He argued that the deities (whose existence he did not deny) lived forevermore in the enjoyment of absolute peacestrangers to all the passions, desires, and fears, which affect humansand totally indifferent to the world and its inhabitants, unmoved alike by their virtues and their crimes. This meant that humans had nothing to fear from them. Lucretius's task was to clearly state and fully develop these views in an attractive form; his work was an attempt to show through poetry that everything in nature can be explained by natural laws, without the need for the intervention of divine beings.Ramsay (1867), pp. 82930. Lucretius identifies the supernatural with the notion that the deities created our world or interfere with its operations in some way. He argues against fear of such deities by demonstrating, through observations and arguments, that the operations of the world can be accounted for in terms of natural phenomena. These phenomena are the result of regular, but purposeless motions and interactions of tiny atoms in empty space. Contents Latin reading of De rerum natura by Lucretius =Synopsis= The poem consists of six untitled books, in dactylic hexameter. The first three books provide a fundamental account of being and nothingness, matter and space, the atoms and their movement, the infinity of the universe both as regards time and space, the regularity of reproduction (no prodigies, everything in its proper habitat), the nature of mind (animus, directing thought) and spirit (anima, sentience) as material bodily entities, and their mortality, since, according to Lucretius, they and their functions (consciousness, pain) end with the bodies that contain them and with which they are interwoven. The last three books give an atomic and materialist explanation of phenomena preoccupying human reflection, such as vision and the senses, sex and reproduction, natural forces and agriculture, the heavens, and disease. Venus (center), urging her to pacify her lover, Mars (right). Given Lucretius's relatively secular philosophy and his eschewing of superstition, his invocation of Venus has caused much debate among scholars. Lucretius opens his poem by addressing Venus not only as the mother of Rome (Aeneadum genetrix) but also as the veritable mother of nature (Alma Venus), urging her to pacify her lover Mars and spare Rome from strife.Leonard (1916). By recalling the opening to poems by Homer, Ennius, and Hesiod (all of which begin with an invocation to the Muses), the proem to De rerum natura conforms to epic convention. The entire proem is also written in the format of a hymn, recalling other early literary works, texts, and hymns and in particular the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite.Keith (2012), p. 39. The choice to address Venus may have been due to Empedocles's belief that Aphrodite represents \\"the great creative force in the cosmos\\".Sedley (2013) [2004]. Given that Lucretius goes on to argue that the gods are removed from human life, many have thus seen this opening to be contradictory: how can Lucretius pray to Venus and then deny that the gods listen to or care about human affairs? In response, many scholars argue that the poet uses Venus poetically as a metonym. For instance, Diskin Clay sees Venus as a poetic substitute for sex, and Bonnie Catto sees the invocation of the name as a metonym for the \\"creative process of natura\\".Catto (1988), p. 98. After the opening, the poem commences with an enunciation of the proposition on the nature and being of the deities, which leads to an invective against the evils of superstition. Lucretius then dedicates time to exploring the axiom that nothing can be produced from nothing, and that nothing can be reduced to nothing (Nil fieri ex nihilo, in nihilum nil posse reverti). Following this, the poet argues that the universe comprises an infinite number of Atoms, which are scattered about in an infinite and vast void (Inane). The shape of these atoms, their properties, their movements, the laws under which they enter into combination and assume forms and qualities appreciable by the senses, with other preliminary matters on their nature and affections, together with a refutation of objections and opposing hypotheses, occupy the first two books. In the third book, the general concepts proposed thus far are applied to demonstrate that the vital and intellectual principles, the Anima and Animus, are as much a part of us as are our limbs and members, but like those limbs and members have no distinct and independent existence, and that hence soul and body live and perish together; the book concludes by arguing that the fear of death is a folly, as death merely extinguishes all feelingboth the good and the bad. The fourth book is devoted to the theory of the senses, sight, hearing, taste, smell, of sleep and of dreams, ending with a disquisition upon love and sex. The fifth book is described by Ramsay as the most finished and impressive, while Stahl argues that its \\"puerile conceptions\\" is proof that Lucretius should be judged as a poet, not as a scientist.Stahl (1962), pp. 8283. This book addresses the origin of the world and of all things therein, the movements of the heavenly bodies, the changing of the seasons, day and night, the rise and progress of humankind, society, political institutions, and the invention of the various arts and sciences which embellish and ennoble life. The sixth book contains an explanation of some of the most striking natural appearances, especially thunder, lightning, hail, rain, snow, ice, cold, heat, wind, earthquakes, volcanoes, springs and localities noxious to animal life, which leads to a discourse upon diseases. This introduces a detailed description of the great pestilence that devastated Athens during the Peloponnesian War. With this episode, the book closes; this abrupt ending suggests that Lucretius might have died before he was able to finalize and fully edit his poem. =Purpose= Lucretius wrote this epic poem to \\"Memmius\\", who may be Gaius Memmius, who in 58 BC was a praetor, a judicial official deciding controversies between citizens and the government.Englert (2003), p. xii. There are over a dozen references to \\"Memmius\\" scattered throughout the long poem in a variety of contexts in translation, such as \\"Memmius mine\\", \\"my Memmius\\", and \\"illustrious Memmius\\". According to Lucretius's frequent statements in his poem, the main purpose of the work was to free Gaius Memmius's mind of the supernatural and the fear of death—and to induct him into a state of ataraxia by expounding the philosophical system of Epicurus, whom Lucretius glorifies as the hero of his epic poem. However, the purpose of the poem is subject to ongoing scholarly debate. Lucretius refers to Memmius by name four times in the first book, three times in the second, five in the fifth, and not at all in the third, fourth, or sixth books. In relation to this discrepancy in the frequency of Lucretius's reference to the apparent subject of his poem, Kannengiesse advances the theory that Lucretius wrote the first version of De rerum natura for the reader at large, and subsequently revised in order to write it for Memmius. However, Memmius' name is central to several critical verses in the poem, and this theory has therefore been largely discredited.Stearns (1931), p. 67. The German classicists Ivo Bruns and Samuel Brandt set forth an alternative theory that Lucretius did at first write the poem with Memmius in mind, but that his enthusiasm for his patron cooled over time.Bruns (1884).Brandt (1885). Stearns suggests that this is because Memmius reneged on a promise to pay for a new school to be built on the site of the old Epicurean school. Memmius was also a tribune in 66, praetor in 58, governor of Bithynia in 57, and was a candidate for the consulship in 54 but was disqualified for bribery, and Stearns suggests that the warm relationship between patron and client may have cooled (sed tua me virtus tamen et sperata voluptas / suavis amicitiae quemvis efferre laborem, \\"But still your merit, and as I hope, the joy / Of our sweet friendship, urge me to any toil\\").Stearns (1931), p. 68.Lucretius, De rerum natura 1.140. There is a certain irony to the poem, namely that while Lucretius extols the virtue of the Epicurean school of thought, Epicurus himself had advised his acolytes from penning poetry because he believed it to make that which was simple overly complicated.Lucretius & de May (2009), v. Near the end of his first book, Lucretius defends his fusion of Epicureanism and poetry with a simile, arguing that the philosophy he espouses is like a medicine: life-saving but often unpleasant. Poetry, on the other hand, is like honey, in that it is a \\"a sweetener that sugarcoats the bitter medicine of Epicurean philosophy and entices the audience to swallow it.\\"Lucretius, De rerum natura 1.93650.Keith (2013), p. 46. (Of note, Lucretius repeats these 25 lines, almost verbatim, in the introduction to the fourth book.)Lucretius, De rerum natura 4.125. =Completeness= The state of the poem as it currently exists suggests that it was released in an unfinished state.Butterfield (2013), p. 2. For instance, the poem concludes rather abruptly while detailing the Plague of Athens, there are redundant passages throughout (e.g., 1.820–821 and 2.1015–1016) alongside other aesthetic “loose ends”, and at 5.155 Lucretius mentions that he will spend a great deal of time discussing the nature of the gods, which never comes to pass.Butterfield (2013), p. 2, note 7.Lucretius & Trevelyan (1937), p. xii. Some have suggested that Lucretius died before being able to edit, finalize, and publish his work.West (2007), p. 13. Main ideas =Metaphysics= Lack of divine intervention After the poem was rediscovered and made its rounds across Europe and beyond, numerous thinkers began to see Lucretius's Epicureanism as a \\"threat synonymous with atheism.\\" Some Christian apologists viewed De rerum natura as an atheist manifesto and a dangerous foil to be thwarted.Sheppard (2015), p. 31. However, at that time the label was extremely broad and did not necessarily mean a denial of divine entities (for example, some large Christian sects labelled dissenting groups as atheists).Sheppard (2015), pp. 21–23. What is more, Lucretius does not deny the existence of deities;Palmer (2014), p. 26. \\"Lucretius was a theist.\\"Bullivant & Ruse 2013. \\"To be sure, Lucretius and Epicurus are not professed atheists [but] the resulting theism is one that denies providence and rejects transcendentalism.\\" he simply argues that they did not create the universe, that they do not care about human affairs, and that they do not intervene in the world. Regardless, due to the ideas espoused in the poem, much of Lucretius's work was seen by many as direct a challenge to theistic, Christian belief.Sheppard (2015), p. 29. The historian Ada Palmer has labelled six ideas in Lucretius's thought (viz. his assertion that the world was created from chaos, and his denials of Providence, divine participation, miracles, the efficacy of prayer, and an afterlife) as \\"proto- atheistic\\".Palmer (2014), p. 25.Palmer (2014), p. 26. She qualifies her use of this term, cautioning that it is not to be used to say that Lucretius was himself an atheist in the modern sense of the word, nor that atheism is a teleological necessity, but rather that many of his ideas were taken up by 19th, 20th, and 21st century atheists. Repudiation of immortality De rerum natura does not argue that the soul does not exist; rather, the poem claims that the soul, like all things in existence, is made up of atoms, and because these atoms will one day drift apart, the human soul is not immortal. Lucretius thus argues that death is simply annihilation, and that there is no afterlife. He likens the physical body to a vessel that holds both the mind (mens) and spirit (anima). To prove that neither the mind nor spirit can survive independent of the body, Lucretius uses a simple analogy: when a vessel shatters, its contents spill everywhere; likewise, when the body dies, the mind and spirit dissipate. And as a simple ceasing-to-be, death can be neither good nor bad for this being, since a dead personbeing completely devoid of sensation and thoughtcannot miss being alive. To further alleviate the fear of non-existence, Lucretius makes use of the symmetry argument: he argues that the eternal oblivion awaiting all humans after death is exactly the same as the infinite nothingness that preceded our birth. Since that nothingness (which he likens to a deep, peaceful sleep) caused us no pain or discomfort, we should not fear the same nothingness that will follow our own demise: > :Look back againhow the endless ages of time comes to pass :Before our birth > are nothing to us. This is a looking glass :Nature holds up for us in which > we see the time to come :After we finally die. What is there that looks so > fearsome? :What's so tragic? Isn't it more peaceful than any > sleep?Lucretius, De rerum natura 3.97276. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Lucretius sees those who fear death as embracing the fallacious assumption that they will be present in some sense \\"to regret and bewail [their] own non-existence.\\" =Physics= Lucretius maintained that he could free humankind from fear of the deities by demonstrating that all things occur by natural causes without any intervention by the deities. Historians of science, however, have been critical of the limitations of his Epicurean approach to science, especially as it pertained to astronomical topics, which he relegated to the class of \\"unclear\\" objects.Lloyd (1973), p. 26.Stahl (1962), pp. 8183. Thus, he began his discussion by claiming that he would > explain by what forces nature steers the courses of the Sun and the > journeyings of the Moon, so that we shall not suppose that they run their > yearly races between heaven and earth of their own free will [i.e., are gods > themselves] or that they are rolled round in furtherance of some divine > plan....Lucretius, De rerum natura 5.7681. However, when he set out to put this plan into practice, he limited himself to showing how one, or several different, naturalistic accounts could explain certain natural phenomena. He was unable to tell his readers how to determine which of these alternatives might be the true one.Alioto (1987), p. 97. For instance, when considering the reason for stellar movements, Lucretius provides two possible explanations: that the sky itself rotates, or that the sky as a whole is stationary while constellations move. If the latter is true, Lucretius, notes, this is because: \\"either swift currents of ether whirl round and round and roll their fires at large across the nocturnal regions of the sky\\"; \\"an external current of air from some other quarter may whirl them along in their course\\"; or \\"they may swim of their own accord, each responsive to the call of its own food, and feed their fiery bodies in the broad pastures of the sky\\". Lucretius concludes that \\"one of these causes must certainly operate in our world... But to lay down which of them it is lies beyond the range of our stumbling progress.\\"Lucretius, De rerum natura 5.510533. Despite his advocacy of empiricism and his many correct conjectures about atomism and the nature of the physical world, Lucretius concludes his first book stressing the absurdity of the (by then well-established) round earth theory, favor instead a flat earth cosmology. Drawing on these, and other passages, William Stahl considered that \\"The anomalous and derivative character of the scientific portions of Lucretius' poem makes it reasonable to conclude that his significance should be judged as a poet, not as a scientist.\\"Stahl (1962), p. 83. His naturalistic explanations were meant to bolster the ethical and philosophical ideas of Epicureanism, not to reveal true explanations of the physical world. The swerve Determinism appears to conflict with the concept of free will. Lucretius attempts to allow for free will in his physicalistic universe by postulating an indeterministic tendency for atoms to veer randomly (, literally \\"the turning aside of a thing\\", but often translated as \\"the swerve\\").Lewis & Short (1879). According to Lucretius, this unpredictable swerve occurs at no fixed place or time: > When atoms move straight down through the void by their own weight, they > deflect a bit in space at a quite uncertain time and in uncertain places, > just enough that you could say that their motion has changed. But if they > were not in the habit of swerving, they would all fall straight down through > the depths of the void, like drops of rain, and no collision would occur, > nor would any blow be produced among the atoms. In that case, nature would > never have produced anything.Lucretius, De rerum natura 2.216224.Lucretius, > Inwood, & Gerson (1994), pp. 6566. This swerving provides the indeterminacy that Lucretius argues allows for the \\"free will which living things throughout the world have\\" (libera per terras ... haec animantibus exstat ... voluntas).Lucretius, De rerum natura 2.25657. Textual history =Classical antiquity to the Middle Ages= St. Jerome contended in his Chronicon that Cicero amended and edited De rerum natura. This assertion has been hotly debated, with most scholars thinking it was a mistake on Jerome's part. Martin Ferguson Smith notes that Cicero's close friend, Titus Pomponius Atticus, was an Epicurean publisher, and it is possible his slaves made the very first copies of De rerum natura.Smith (1992) [1924], pp. xiiixiv. If this were the case, then it might explain how Cicero came to be familiar with Lucretius's work.Smith (1992) [1924], p. xiii. In c. AD 380, St. Jerome would contend in his Chronicon that Cicero amended and edited De rerum natura,Jerome, Chronicon. although most scholars argue that this is an erroneous claim; the classicist David Butterfield argues that this mistake was likely made by Jerome (or his sources) because the earliest reference to Lucretius is in the aforementioned letter from Cicero.Butterfield (2013), p. 1, note 4. Nevertheless, a small minority of scholars argue that Jerome's assertion may be credible. The oldest purported fragments of De rerum natura were published by K. Kleve in 1989 and consist of sixteen fragments. These remnants were discovered among the Epicurean library in the Villa of the Papyri, Herculaneum. Because, as W. H. D. Rouse notes, \\"the fragments are so minute and bear so few certainly identifiable letters\\", at this point in time \\"some scepticism about their proposed authorship seems pardonable and prudent.\\" However, Kleve contends that four of the six books are represented in the fragments, which he argues is reason to assume that the entire poem was at one time kept in the library. If Lucretius's poem were to be definitely placed at the Villa of the Papyri, it would suggest that it was studied by the Neapolitan Epicurean school.Rouse (1992) [1924], pp. livlv. Copies of the poem were preserved in a number of medieval libraries, with the earliest extant manuscripts dating to the ninth century.Butterfield (2013), pp. 613. The oldestand, according to David Butterfield, most famousof these is the Codex Oblongus, often called O. This copy has been dated to the early ninth century and was produced by a Carolingian scriptorium (likely a monastery connected to the court of Charlemagne).Butterfield (2013), pp. 68. O is currently housed at Leiden University.Butterfield (2013), p. 8. The second of these ninth-century manuscripts is the Codex Quadratus, often called Q. This manuscript was likely copied after O, sometime in the mid-ninth century.Butterfield (2013), pp. 89. Today, Q is also housed at Leiden University.Butterfield (2013), p. 312. The third and final ninth-century manuscriptwhich comprises the Schedae Gottorpienses fragment (commonly called G and located in the Kongelige Bibliotek of Copenhagen) and the Schedae Vindobonenses fragments (commonly called V and U and located in the Austrian National Library in Vienna)was christened by Butterfield as S and has been dated to the latter part of the ninth century.Butterfield (2013), pp. 1011.Butterfield (2013), pp. 31314. Scholars consider manuscripts O, Q, and S to all be descendants of the original archetype, which they dub Ω.Butterfield (2013), p. 17. However, while O is a direct descendant of the archetype, Q and S are believed to have both been derived from a manuscript (Ψ) that in turn had been derived from a damaged and modified version of the archetype (ΩI).Butterfield (2013), pp. 1516.Butterfield (2013), pp. 1819. =Rediscovery to the present= De rerum natura was rediscovered by Poggio Bracciolini c.14161417. While there exist a handful of references to Lucretius in Romance and Germanic sources dating between the ninth and fifteenth centuries (references that, according to Ada Palmer, \\"indicate a tenacious, if spotty knowledge of the poet and some knowledge of [his] poem\\"), no manuscripts of De rerum natura currently survive from this span of time.Palmer (2014), p. 100. Rather, all the remaining Lucretian manuscripts that are currently extant date from or after the fifteenth century.Smith (1992) [1924], p. lvi. This is because De rerum natura was rediscovered in January 1417 by Poggio Bracciolini, who probably found the poem in the Benedictine library at Fulda. The manuscript that Poggio discovered did not survive, but a copy (the \\"Codex Laurentianus 35.30\\") of it by Poggio's friend, Niccolò de' Niccoli, did, and today it is kept at the Laurentian Library in Florence. Machiavelli made a copy early in his life. Molière produced a verse translation which does not survive; John Evelyn translated the first book. The Italian scholar Guido Billanovich demonstrated that Lucretius' poem was well known in its entirety by Lovato Lovati (1241–1309) and some other Paduan pre-humanists during the thirteenth century.Billanovich (1958). This proves that the work was known in select circles long before the official rediscovery by Poggio. It has been suggested that Dante (1265–1321) might have read Lucretius's poem, as a few verses of his Divine Comedy exhibit a great affinity with De rerum natura, but there is no conclusive evidence that Dante ever read Lucretius. The first printed edition of De rerum natura was produced in Brescia, Lombardy, in 1473. Other printed editions followed soon after. Additionally, although only published in 1996, Lucy Hutchinson's translation of De rerum natura was in all likelihood the first in English and was most likely completed some time in the late 1640s or 1650s.Goldberg (2006), p. 275. Reception =Classical antiquity= alt=Bust of Cicero The earliest recorded critique of Lucretius's work is in a letter written by the Roman statesman Cicero to his brother Quintus, in which the former claims that Lucretius's poetry is \\"full of inspired brilliance, but also of great artistry\\" (Lucreti poemata, ut scribis, ita sunt, multis luminibus ingeni, multae tamen artis).Lucretius & Lee (1893), p. xiii.Cicero, Epistulae ad Quintum Fratrem 2.10.3. It is also believed that the Roman poet Virgil referenced Lucretius and his work in the second book of his Georgics when he wrote: \\"Happy is he who has discovered the causes of things and has cast beneath his feet all fears, unavoidable fate, and the din of the devouring Underworld\\" (felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas/atque metus omnis et inexorabile fatum/subiecit pedibus strepitumque Acherontis avari).Virgil, Georgics 2.490–492.Smith (1992) [1924], p. xx. According to David Sedley of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \\"With these admiring words, Virgil neatly encapsulates four dominant themes of the poemuniversal causal explanation, leading to elimination of the threats the world seems to pose, a vindication of free will, and disproof of the soul's survival after death.\\" Lucretius was almost certainly read by the imperial poet Marcus Manilius (fl. 1st century AD), whose didactic poem Astronomica (written c. AD 1020), alludes to De rerum natura in a number of places.Volk (2009), p. 192. However, Manilius's poem, espouses a Stoic, deterministic understanding of the universe,Volk (2009) (2009), p. 1. and by its very nature attacks the very philosophical underpinnings of Lucretius's worldview. This has led scholars like Katharina Volk to argue that \\"Manilius is a veritable anti-Lucretius\\". What is more, Manilius also seems to suggest throughout this poem that his work is superior to that of Lucretius's.Volk (2009), p. 193. (Coincidentally, De rerum natura and the Astronomica were both rediscovered by Poggio Bracciolini in the early 15th century.)\\"Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini\\" (2013). Additionally, Lucretius's work is discussed by the Augustan poet Ovid, who in his Amores writes \\"the verses of the sublime Lucretius will perish only when a day will bring the end of the world\\" (Carmina sublimis tunc sunt peritura Lucreti / exitio terras cum dabit una dies),Ovid, Amores 1.15.2324. and the Silver Age poet Statius, who in his Silvae praises Lucretius as being highly \\"learned\\".Statius, Silvae 2.7.76. David Butterfield also writes that \\"clear echoes and/or responses\\" to De rerum natura can be detected in the works of the Roman elegiac poets Catullus, Propertius, and Tibullus, as well as the lyric poet Horace.Butterfield (2013), pp. 4748. In regards to prose writers, a number either quote from Lucretius's poem or express great admiration for De rerum natura, including: Vitruvius (in De Architectura),Vitruvius, De Architectura 9.pr.1718.Butterfield (2013), p. 49. Marcus Velleius Paterculus (in the Historiae Romanae),Marcus Velleius Paterculus, Historiae Romanae 2.36.2. Quintilian (in the Institutio Oratoria),Butterfield (2013), pp. 5051.Quintilian, Institutio Oratoria 1.4.4; 3.1.4; 10.1.87; 12.11.27. Tacitus (in the Dialogus de oratoribus),Tacitus, Dialogus de oratoribus 23.1. Marcus Cornelius Fronto (in De eloquentia),Butterfield (2013), pp. 5253.Marcus Cornelius Fronto, De eloquentia 3.2. Cornelius Nepos (in the Life Of Atticus),Cornelius Nepos, Vitae, \\"Atticus\\" 12.4. Apuleius (in De Deo Socratis),Butterfield (2013), pp. 5354.Apuleius, De Deo Socratis 1.7; 10.7. and Gaius Julius Hyginus (in the Fabulae).Gaius Julius Hyginus, Fabulae 57, 151.Butterfield (2013), p. 54. Additionally, Pliny the Elder lists Lucretius (presumably referring to his De rerum natura) as a source at the beginning of his Naturalis Historia, and Seneca the Younger quoted six passages from De rerum natura across several of his works.Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia 1.Butterfield (2013), pp. 4950. =Late antiquity and the Middle Ages= Because Lucretius was critical of religion and the claim of an immortal soul, his poem was disparaged by most early Church Fathers.Butterfield (2013), p. 56. The Early Christian apologist Lactantius, in particular, heavily cites and critiques Lucretius in his The Divine Institutes and its Epitome, as well as his De ira Dei. While he argued that Lucretius's criticism of Roman religion were \\"sound attacks on paganism and superstition\\", Lactantius claimed that they were futile against the \\"True Faith\\" of Christianity. Lactantius also disparages the science of De rerum natura (as well as of Epicureanism in general), calls Lucretius \\"the most worthless of the poets\\" (poeta inanissimus), notes that he is unable to read more than a few lines of De rerum natura without laughing, and sarcastically asks, \\"Who would think that [Lucretius] had a brain when he said these things?\\"Palmer (2014), p. 125. After Lactantius's time, Lucretius was almost exclusively referenced or alluded to in a negative manner by the Church Fathers. The one major exception to this was Isidore of Seville, who at the start of the 7th century produced a work on astronomy and natural history dedicated to the Visigothic king Sisebut that was entitled De natura rerum. In both this work, and as well as his more well-known Etymologiae (c. AD 600625), Isidore liberally quotes from Lucretius a total of twelve times, drawing verses from all of Lucretius's books except his third.Dronke (1984), p. 459.Butterfield (2013), p. 89. (About a century later, the British historian and Doctor of the Church Bede produced a work also called De natura rerum, partly based on Isidore's work but apparently ignorant of Lucretius's poem.)Kendall & Wallis (2010), p. 191. =Renaissance to the present= Montaigne owned a Latin edition published in Paris, in 1563, by Denis Lambin which he heavily annotated. His Essays contain almost a hundred quotes from De rerum natura. Additionally, in his essay \\"Of Books\\", he lists Lucretius along with Virgil, Horace, and Catullus as his four top poets.Montaigne, Essays, \\"Of Books\\". Notable figures who owned copies include Ben Jonson whose copy is held at the Houghton Library, Harvard; and Thomas Jefferson, who owned at least five Latin editions and English, Italian and French translations. Lucretius has also had a marked influence upon modern philosophy, as perhaps the most complete expositor of Epicurean thought.Gillespie & MacKenzie (2007), p. 322. His influence is especially notable in the work of the Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana, who praised Lucretiusalong with Dante and Goethein his book Three Philosophical Poets,Santayana (1922) [1910], pp. 19–72. although he openly admired the poet's system of physics more so than his spiritual musings (referring to the latter as \\"fumbling, timid and sad\\").Gray (2018), p. 127. In 2011, the historian and literary scholar Stephen Greenblatt wrote a popular history book about the poem, entitled The Swerve: How the World Became Modern. In the work, Greenblatt argues that Poggio Bracciolini's discovery of De rerum natura reintroduced important ideas that sparked the modern age.Garner (2011).Owchar (2011). The book was well- received, and later earned the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction and the 2011 National Book Award for Nonfiction.

An inn is a tavern that has a license to put up guests as lodgers. The word derives from the Latin taberna whose original meaning was a shed, workshop, stall, or pub. Over time, the words \\"tavern\\" and \\"inn\\" became interchangeable and synonymous. In England, inns started to be referred to as public houses or pubs and the term became standard for all drinking houses. Australia \\"Wowser\\" was a negative term for Christian moralists in Australia, especially activists in temperance groups such as the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Historian Stuart Macintyre argues, \\"the achievements of the wowsers were impressive.\\" They passed laws that restricted obscenity and juvenile smoking, raised the age of consent, limited gambling, closed down many pubs, and in 1915–16 established a 6pm closing hour for pubs, which lasted for decades.Stuart Macintyre, The Oxford History of Australia: vol 4: 1901–42 (2002) pp. 112–3 France From at least the 14th century, taverns, along with inns and later cabarets, were the main places to dine out. Typically, a tavern offered various roast meats, as well as simple foods like bread, cheese, herring and bacon. Some offered a richer variety of foods, though it would be cabarets and later traiteurs which offered the finest meals before the restaurant appeared in the 18th century. Their stated purpose, however, was to serve wine (not beer or cider, which had other outlets) and they were so disreputable that women of any standing avoided them.Jim Chevallier, A History of the Food of Paris: From Roast Mammoth to Steak Frites, 2018, , pp. 67-80 After 1500, taxes on wine and other alcoholic beverages grew increasingly more burdensome, not only because of the continual increase in the level of taxation, but also because of the bewildering variety and multiplicity of the taxes. This chaotic system was enforced by an army of tax collectors. The resultant opposition took many forms. Wine growers and tavern keepers concealed wine and falsified their methods of selling it to take advantage of lower tax rates. The retailers also refilled their casks secretly from hidden stocks. Wine merchants stealthily circumvented inspection stations to avoid local import duties. When apprehended, some defrauders reacted with passive resignation, while others resorted to violence. Situated at the heart of the country town or village, the tavern was one of the traditional centers of social and political life before 1789, a meeting place for both the local population and travelers passing through, and a refuge for rogues and scoundrels. Taverns symbolized opposition to the regime and to religion. Taverns sometimes served as restaurants. In 1765, in Paris was founded the first restaurant in the modern sense of the term. However, the first Parisian restaurant worthy of the name was the one founded by Beauvilliers in 1782 in the Rue de Richelieu, called the Grande Taverne de Londres. Émile Zola's novel L'Assommoir (\\"The tavern\\") (1877) depicted the social conditions typical of alcoholism in Paris among the working classes. The drunk destroyed not only his own body, but also his employment, his family, and other interpersonal relationships. The characters Gervaise Macquart and her husband Coupeau exemplified with great realism the physical and moral degradation of alcoholics. Zola's correspondence with physicians reveals that he used authentic medical sources for his realistic depictions in the novel.  Germany  German tavern circa 1470 A common German name for German taverns or pubs is Kneipe. Drinking practices in 16th-century Augsburg, Germany, suggest that the use of alcohol in early modern Germany followed carefully structured cultural norms. Drinking was not a sign of insecurity and disorder. It helped define and enhance men's social status and was therefore tolerated among men as long as they lived up to both the rules and norms of tavern society and the demands of their role as householder. Tavern doors were closed to respectable women unaccompanied by their husbands, and society condemned drunkenness among women, but when alcohol abuse interfered with the household, women could deploy public power to impose limits on men's drinking behavior.Tlusty, Bacchus and Civic Order: The Culture of Drink in Early Modern Germany (2001) Great Britain A scene in an unspecified tavern at Portsmouth after one or more ships have been paid off Taverns were popular places used for business as well as for eating and drinking – the London Tavern was a notable meeting place in the 18th and 19th centuries, for example. However, the word tavern is no longer in popular use in the UK as there is no distinction between a tavern and an inn. Both establishments serve wine and beer/ale. The term 'pub' (an abbreviation of 'public house') is now used to describe these houses. The legacy of taverns and inns is now only found in the pub names, e.g. Fitzroy Tavern, Silver Cross Tavern, Spaniards Inn, etc. The word also survives in songs such as \\"There is a Tavern in the Town\\".Anon (1952). YHA Songbook. Youth Hostels Association (England and Wales), St Albans, Herts. Song 61: \\"There is a tavern in the town\\". The range and quality of pubs varies wildly throughout the UK as does the range of beers, wines, spirits and foods available. Most quality pubs will still serve cask ales and food. In recent years there has been a move towards \\"gastro\\" pubs where the menu is more ambitious. Originally, taverns served as rest stops about every fifteen miles and their main focus was to provide shelter to anyone who was traveling. Such taverns would be divided into two major parts – the sleeping quarters and the bar. There is generally a sign with some type of symbol, often related to the name of the premises, to draw in customers. The purpose of this is to indicate that the establishment sells alcohol and to set it apart from the competition. Iraq One of the earliest references to a tavern is found in Hammurabi's code.https://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp North America  Scandinavia  Scandinavia had very high drinking rates, which led to the formation of a powerful prohibition movement in the 19th century. Magnusson (1986) explains why consumption of spirits was so high in a typical preindustrial village (Eskilstuna) in Sweden, 1820–50. An economic feature of this town of blacksmiths was the Verlag, or outwork production system, with its complex network of credit relationships. The tavern played a crucial role in cultural and business life and was also the place where work and leisure were fused. Heavy drinking facilitated the creation of community relationships in which artisans and workers sought security. Buying drinks rather than saving money was a rational strategy when, before adjustment to a cash economy, it was essential to raise one's esteem with fellow craftsmen to whom one could turn for favors in preference to the Verlag capitalist.  Southern Europe  = Greece = A taverna in Greece is commonly known as a restaurant. Their history begins in Classical times, with the earliest evidence of a taverna discovered at the Ancient Agora of Athens; the style remains the same to this day. Greek tavernes (plural of taverna) are the most common restaurants in Greece. A typical menu includes portion dishes, or small dishes of meat and fish, as well as salads and appetizers. Mageirefta is the menu section that includes a variety of different casserole cooked dishes every day. The other choices are mainly prepared roasted (tis oras) or fried. Orektika (appetizers) include small dishes of Greek sauces, alifes, usually eaten on bites of bread. Tavernes offer different kinds of wines and retsina in barrels or in bottles, ouzo or tsipouro, with beer and refreshments being a recent addition. In Byzantine times, tavernes were the place for a social gathering, to enjoy a meal, live music and friendly talk with a drink accompanied by small variety dishes (mezes). =Former Yugoslavia= In former Yugoslavia, the kafana served food and alcoholic beverages.

They were originally chest high, and a bar, often brass, ran the length of the table, just above floor height, for customers to rest a foot on, which gave the table its name. Over many years, heights of bars were lowered, and high stools added, and the brass bar remains today. The name bar became identified with the business, (also known as a saloon or a tavern or sometimes as a pub or club, referring to the actual establishment, as in pub bar or club bar etc.) is a retail business establishment that serves alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine, liquor, cocktails, and other beverages such as mineral water and soft drinks. Bars often also sell snack foods such as crisps (also referred to as potato chips) or peanuts, for consumption on their premises.Cocktail Lounge definition from The Free Dictionary Some types of bars, such as pubs, may also serve food from a restaurant menu. The term \\"bar\\" also refers to the countertop and area where drinks are served. The term \\"bar\\" derives from the metal or wooden bar (barrier) that is often located along the length of the \\"bar\\". \\\\- 'bar[:] \\"tavern,\\" 1590s, so called in reference to the bars of the barrier or counter over which drinks or food were served to customers [...].' Bars provide stools or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. Bars that offer entertainment or live music are often referred to as \\"music bars\\", \\"live venues\\", or \\"nightclubs\\". Types of bars range from inexpensive dive bars to elegant places of entertainment, often accompanying restaurants for dining. Many bars operate a discount period, designated a \\"happy hour\\" or discount of the day to encourage off-peak-time patronage. Bars that fill to capacity sometimes implement a cover charge or a minimum drink- purchase requirement during their peak hours. Bars may have bouncers to ensure that patrons are of legal age, to eject drunk or belligerent patrons, and to collect cover charges. Such bars often feature entertainment, which may be a live band, vocalist, comedian, or disc jockey playing recorded music. Patrons may sit or stand at the counter and be served by the bartender. Depending on the size of a bar and its approach, alcohol may be served at the bar by bartenders, at tables by servers, or by a combination of the two. The \\"back bar\\" is a set of shelves of glasses and bottles behind the counter. In some establishments, the back bar is elaborately decorated with woodwork, etched glass, mirrors, and lights. History Depression-era bar in Melrose, Louisiana There have been many different names for public drinking spaces throughout history. In the colonial era of the United States, taverns were an important meeting place, as most other institutions were weak. During the 19th century saloons were very important to the leisure time of the working class.John M. Kingsdale, \\"The 'Poor Man's Club': Social Functions of the Urban-Working Class Saloon\\", in American Quarterly, Vol. 25, No. 4. (Oct. 1973) Today, even when an establishment uses a different name, such as \\"tavern\\" or \\"saloon\\" or, in the United Kingdom, a \\"pub\\", the area of the establishment where the bartender pours or mixes beverages is normally called \\"the bar\\". The sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages was prohibited in the first half of the 20th century in several countries, including Finland, Iceland, Norway, and the United States. In the United States, illegal bars during Prohibition were called \\"speakeasies\\", \\"blind pigs\\", and \\"blind tigers\\". Legal restrictions Laws in many jurisdictions prohibit minors from entering a bar. If those under legal drinking age are allowed to enter, as is the case with pubs that serve food, they are not allowed to drink. In some jurisdictions, bars cannot serve a patron who is already intoxicated. Cities and towns usually have legal restrictions on where bars may be located and on the types of alcohol they may serve to their customers. Some bars may have a license to serve beer and wine, but not hard liquor. In some jurisdictions, patrons buying alcohol must also order food. In some jurisdictions, bar owners have a legal liability for the conduct of patrons who they serve (this liability may arise in cases of driving under the influence which cause injuries or deaths). Many Islamic countries prohibit bars as well as the possession or sale of alcohol for religious reasons, while others, including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, allow bars in some specific areas, but only permit non-Muslims to drink in them. Types Gunpowder Cellar of Tartu, a former 18th-century gunpowder cellar and current beer restaurant in Tartu, Estonia Drinking at the bar, Raceland, Louisiana, September 1938 Example of a typical home bar in New York City, USA A bar's owners and managers choose the bar's name, décor, drink menu, lighting, and other elements which they think will attract a certain kind of patron. However, they have only limited influence over who patronizes their establishment. Thus, a bar originally intended for one demographic profile can become popular with another. For example, a gay or lesbian bar with a dance or disco floor might, over time, attract an increasingly heterosexual clientele, or a blues bar may become a biker bar if most its patrons are bikers. Bars can also be an integral part of larger venues. For example, hotels, casinos and nightclubs are usually home to one or several bars. A cocktail lounge is an upscale bar that is typically located within a hotel, restaurant or airport. A full bar serves liquor, cocktails, wine, and beer. A wine bar is a bar that focuses on wine rather than on beer or liquor. Patrons of these bars may taste wines before deciding to buy them. Some wine bars also serve small plates of food or other snacks. A beer bar focuses on beer, particularly craft beer, rather than on wine or liquor. A brew pub has an on-site brewery and serves craft beers. \\"Fern bar\\" is an American slang term for an upscale or preppy (or yuppie) bar. A music bar is a bar that presents live music as an attraction, such as a piano bar. A dive bar, often referred to simply as a \\"dive\\", is a very informal bar which may be considered by some to be disreputable. A non- alcoholic bar is a bar that does not serve alcoholic beverages. A strip club is a bar with nude entertainers. A bar and grill is also a restaurant. Some persons may designate either a room or an area of a room as a home bar. Furniture and arrangements vary from efficient to full bars that could be suited as businesses. =Entertainment= Many sports bars sell food such as chicken wings. Bars categorized by the kind of entertainment they offer: *Arcade bars, in which the bar have video games on cabinets and consoles *Blues bars, specializing in the live blues style of music *Comedy bars, specializing in stand-up comedy entertainment *Dance bars, which have a dance floor where patrons dance to recorded music. Typically, if a venue has a large dance floor, focuses primarily on dancing rather than seated drinking, and hires professional DJs, it is considered to be a nightclub or discothèque rather than a bar. *Karaoke bars, with nightly karaoke as entertainment *Music bars, specializing in live music (i.e. concerts). Piano bars are one example. *Drag bars, which specialize in drag performances as entertainment *Salsa bars, where patrons dance to Latin salsa music *Sports bars, which are furnished with sports-related memorabilia and theming, and typically contain a large number of televisions used to broadcast major sporting events for their patrons. *A tiki bar offers a fully immersive and entertaining environment, including tropical cocktails, tiki carvings, exotica music, a dark, windowless space with light fixtures lending a soft glow, and nautical brick-a-brac that hints at romantic travels to exotic lands. *Topless bars, where topless female employees dance or serve drinks. In India, these bars are called dance bars, which is distinct from the type of \\"dance bar\\" discussed above. =Patrons= The alt= A two-story building with brick on the first floor, with two arched doorways, and gray stucco on the second floor, off of which hang numerous rainbow flags. Bars can categorized by the kind of patrons who frequent them: *Bicycle messenger bars, where bike messengers congregate; these are found only in cities with large bike messenger communities *Biker bars, which are bars frequented by motorcycle enthusiasts and (in some regions) motorcycle club members. *Cop bars, where off-duty law enforcement agents gather. *College bars, usually located in or near universities, where most of the patrons are students *Gay bars, where gay men or women dance and socialize *Hipster bars, where hipsters are the patrons of this bar *Lesbian bars *Neighborhood bars, a bar that most of the patrons know each other; it is generally close to home and is frequented regularly *\\"Old man\\" bars, whose clientele are mainly long-time male patrons who know each other well; since most patrons are retired, they often begin drinking much earlier in the day, consume inexpensive beer/whisky and may spend much of the day chatting, reading the newspaper, and watching television *Sailor bars, usually located in waterfront areas near commercial docks or naval bases *Singles bars where (mostly) unmarried people of both sexes can meet and socialize *Sports bars, where sports fans gather to cheer on their favorite teams with other like- minded fans. Sports bars generally have a dozen or more televisions, in order to display simultaneous games or sports *Women's bars Bar (counter) liquor bottles behind a bar Liquor and wine bottles displayed in a cabinet behind a bar in Baden, Austria The counter at which drinks are served by a bartender is called \\"the bar\\". This term is applied, as a synecdoche, to drinking establishments called \\"bars\\". This counter typically stores a variety of beers, wines, liquors, and non-alcoholic ingredients, and is organized to facilitate the bartender's work. Counters for serving other types of food and drink may also be called bars. Examples of this usage of the word include snack bars, sushi bars, juice bars, salad bars, dairy bars, and ice cream sundae bars. Locations =Australia= In Australia, the major form of licensed commercial alcohol outlet from the colonial period to the present was the pub, a local variant of the English original. Until the 1970s, Australian pubs were traditionally organised into gender-segregated drinking areas—the \\"public bar\\" was only open to men, while the \\"lounge bar\\" or \\"saloon bar\\" served both men and women (i.e. mixed drinking). This distinction was gradually eliminated as anti-discrimination legislation and women's rights activism broke down the concept of a public drinking area accessible to only men. Where two bars still exist in the one establishment, one (that derived from the \\"public bar\\") will be more downmarket while the other (deriving from the \\"lounge bar\\") will be more upmarket. Over time, with the introduction of gaming machines into hotels, many \\"lounge bars\\" have or are being converted into gaming rooms. Beginning in the mid-1950s, the formerly strict state liquor licensing laws were progressively relaxed and reformed, with the result that pub trading hours were extended. This was in part to eliminate the social problems associated with early closing times—notably the infamous \\"six o'clock swill\\"—and the thriving trade in \\"sly grog\\" (illicit alcohol sales). More licensed liquor outlets began to appear, including retail \\"bottle shops\\" (over-the-counter bottle sales were previously only available at pubs and were strictly controlled). Particularly in Sydney, a new class of licensed premises, the wine bar, appeared; there alcohol could be served on the proviso that it was provided in tandem with a meal. These venues became very popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s and many offered free entertainment, becoming an important facet of the Sydney music scene in that period. In the major Australian cities today there is a large and diverse bar scene with a range of ambiences, modes and styles catering for every echelon of cosmopolitan society. =Canada= Public drinking began with the establishment of colonial taverns in both the U.S and Canada. While the term changed to Public house especially in the U.K., the term Tavern continued to be used instead of Pub in both the U.S and Canada. Public drinking establishments were banned by the Prohibition of alcohol, which was (and is) a provincial jurisdiction. Prohibition was repealed, province by province in the 1920s. There was not a universal right to consume alcohol, and only males of legal age were permitted to do so. \\"Beer parlours\\" were common in the wake of prohibition, with local laws often not permitting entertainment (such as the playing of games or music) in these establishments, which were set aside for the purpose solely of consuming alcohol. Since the end of the Second World War, and exposure by roughly one million Canadians to the public house traditions common in the UK by servicemen and women serving there, those traditions became more common in Canada. These traditions include the drinking of dark ales and stouts, the \\"pub\\" as a social gathering place for both sexes, and the playing of games (such as darts, snooker or pool). Tavern became extremely popular during the 1960s and 1970s, especially for working-class people. Canadian taverns, which can still be found in remote regions of Northern Canada, have long tables with benches lining the sides. Patrons in these taverns often order beer in large quart bottles and drink inexpensive \\"bar brand\\" Canadian rye whisky. In some provinces, taverns used to have separate entrances for men and women. Even in a large city like Toronto the separate entrances existed into the early 1970s. Canada has adopted some of the newer U.S. bar traditions (such as the \\"sports bar\\") of the last decades. As a result, the term \\"bar\\" has come to be differentiated from the term \\"pub\\", in that bars are usually 'themed' and sometimes have a dance floor. Bars with dance floors are usually relegated to small or Suburban communities. In larger cities bars with large dance floors are usually referred to as clubs and are strictly for dancing, Establishments which call themselves pubs are often much more similar to a British pub in style. Before the 1980s, most \\"bars\\" were referred to simply as \\"tavern\\". Often, bars and pubs in Canada will cater to supporters of a local sporting team, usually a hockey team. There is a difference between the sports bar and the pub; sports bars focus on TV screens showing games and showcasing uniforms, equipment, etc. Pubs will generally also show games but do not exclusively focus on them. The Tavern was popular until the early 1980s, when American-style bars, as we know them today became popular. In the 1990s imitation British- and Irish-style pubs become popular and adopted names like \\"The Fox and Fiddle\\" and \\"The Queen and Beaver\\" reflect naming trends in Britain. Tavern or pub style mixed food and drink establishment are generally more common than bars in Canada, although both can be found. Legal restrictions on bars are set by the Canadian provinces and territories, which has led to a great deal of variety. While some provinces have been very restrictive with their bar regulation, setting strict closing times and banning the removal of alcohol from the premises, other provinces have been more liberal. Closing times generally run from 2:00 to 4:00 a.m. In Nova Scotia, particularly in Halifax, there was, until the 1980s, a very distinct system of gender-based laws were in effect for decades. Taverns, bars, halls, and other classifications differentiated whether it was exclusively for men or women, men with invited women, vice versa, or mixed. After this fell by the wayside, there was the issue of water closets. This led to many taverns adding on \\"powder rooms\\"; sometimes they were constructed later, or used parts of kitchens or upstairs halls, if plumbing allowed. This was also true of conversions in former \\"sitting rooms\\", for men's facilities. =Italy= The bar in the coach terminal at Udine, Italy In Italy, a \\"bar\\" is a place more similar to a café, where people go during the morning or the afternoon, usually to drink a coffee, a cappuccino, or a hot chocolate and eat some kind of snack such as sandwiches (panini or tramezzini) or pastries. However, any kind of alcoholic beverages are served. Opening hours vary: some establishments are open very early in the morning and close relatively early in the evening; others, especially if next to a theater or a cinema, may be open until late at night. Many larger bars are also restaurants and disco clubs. Many Italian bars have introduced a so-called \\"aperitivo\\" time in the evening, in which everyone who purchases an alcoholic drink then has free access to a usually abundant buffet of cold dishes such as pasta salads, vegetables, and various appetizers. =Poland= The oldest bar serving pasztecik szczeciński in Szczecin In modern Polish, in most cases a bar would be referred to as pub (plural puby), a loan from English. Polish puby serve various kinds of alcoholic drinks as well as other beverages and simple snacks such as crisps, peanuts or pretzel sticks. Most establishments feature loud music and some have frequent live performances. While Polish word bar can be also applied to this kind of establishment, it is often used to describe any kind of inexpensive restaurant, and therefore can be translated as diner or cafeteria. Both in bary and in puby, the counter at which one orders is called bar, itself being another obvious loanword from English. Bar mleczny (literally 'milk bar') is a kind of inexpensive self-service restaurant serving wide range of dishes, with simple interior design, usually opened during breakfast and lunch hours. It is very similar to Russian столовая in both menu and decor. It can be also compared to what is called greasy spoon in English-speaking countries. Bary mleczne rarely serve alcoholic beverages. The term bar szybkiej obsługi (lit. 'quick service restaurant') also refers to eating - not drinking - establishments. It is being gradually replaced by the English term fast food. Another name, bar samoobsługowy may be applied for any kind of self-service restaurant. Some kinds of Polish bar serve only one type of meal. An example are restaurants serving pasztecik szczeciński, a traditional specialty of the city of Szczecin. It can be consumed at the table or take-out. =Spain= Bars are common in Spain and form an important part in Spanish culture. In Spain, it is common for a town to have many bars and even to have several lined up on the same street. Most bars have a section of the street or plaza outside with tables and chairs with parasols if the weather allows it. Spanish bars are also known for serving a wide range of sandwiches (bocadillos), as well as snacks called tapas or pinchos. Tapas and pinchos may be offered to customers in two ways, either complementary to order a drink or in some cases there are charged independently, either case this is usually clearly indicated to bar customers by display of wall information, on menus and price lists. The anti-smoking law has entered in effect January 1, 2011 and since that date it is prohibited to smoke in bars and restaurants as well as all other indoor areas, closed commercial and state owned facilities are now smoke-free areas. Spain is the country with the highest ratio of bars/population with almost six bars per thousand inhabitants, three times UK's ratio and four times Germany's, and it alone has double the number of bars than the oldest of the 28 members of the European Union. The meaning of the word 'bar' in Spain, however, does not have the negative connotation inherent in the same word in many other languages. For Spanish people a bar is essentially a meeting place, and not necessarily a place to engage in the consumption of alcoholic beverages. As a result, children are normally allowed into bars, and it is common to see families in bars during week-ends of the end of the day. In small towns, the 'bar' may constitute the very center of social life, and it is customary that, after social events, people go to bars, including seniors and children alike. =United Kingdom= Jimmy Wales at the bar during Wikimania 2014 in the Barbican Centre, London In the UK, bars are either areas that serve alcoholic drinks within establishments such as hotels, restaurants, universities, or are a particular type of establishment which serves alcoholic drinks such as wine bars, \\"style bars\\", private membership only bars. However, the main type of establishment selling alcohol for consumption on the premises is the pub. Some bars are similar to nightclubs in that they feature loud music, subdued lighting, or operate a dress code and admissions policy, with inner city bars generally having door staff at the entrance. 'Bar' also designates a separate drinking area within a pub. Until recent years most pubs had two or more bars – very often the public bar or tap room and the saloon bar or lounge, where the decor was better and prices were sometimes higher. The designations of the bars varied regionally. In the last two decades, many pub interiors have been opened up into single spaces, which some people regret as it loses the flexibility, intimacy, and traditional feel of a multi-roomed public house. One of the last dive bars in London was underneath the Kings Head Pub in Gerrard Street, Soho. =United States= Anaconda, Montana In the United States, legal distinctions often exist between restaurants and bars, and even between types of bars. These distinctions vary from state to state, and even among municipalities. Beer bars (sometimes called taverns or pubs) are legally restricted to selling only beer, and possibly wine or cider. Liquor bars, also simply called bars, also sell hard liquor. Bars are sometimes exempt from smoking bans that restaurants are subject to, even if those restaurants have liquor licenses. The distinction between a restaurant that serves liquor and a bar is usually made by the percentage of revenue earned from selling liquor, although increasingly, smoking bans include bars as well. A bar named \\"Bar\\" in New Haven, Connecticut In most places, bars are prohibited from selling alcoholic beverages to go, and this makes them clearly different from liquor stores. Some brewpubs and wineries can serve alcohol to go, but under the rules applied to a liquor store. In some areas, such as New Orleans and parts of Las Vegas and Savannah, Georgia, open containers of alcohol may be prepared to go. This kind of restriction is usually dependent on an open container law. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, bars may sell six-packs of beer \\"to-go\\" in original (sealed) containers by obtaining a take-out license. New Jersey permits all forms of packaged goods to be sold at bars, and permits packaged beer and wine to be sold at any time on-premises sales of alcoholic beverages are allowed. During the 19th century, drinking establishments were called saloons. In the American Old West the most popular establishment in town was usually the Western saloon. Many of these Western saloons survive, though their services and features have changed with the times. Newer establishments have sometimes been built in Western saloon style for a nostalgic effect. In American cities there were also numerous saloons, which allowed only male patrons and were usually owned by one of the major breweries. Drunkenness, fights, and alcoholism made the saloon into a powerful symbol of all that was wrong with alcohol.Burns, Ken, and Novick, Lynn, Prohibition, 2011 Saloons were the primary target of the Temperance movement, and the Anti-Saloon League, founded in 1892, was the most powerful lobby in favor of Prohibition. When Prohibition was repealed, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked the states not to permit the return of saloons.Prohibition Repeal is Ratified at 5:32 P.M., The New York Times, December 5, 1933 Many Irish- or British-themed \\"pubs\\" exist throughout United States and Canada and in some continental European countries. As of May, 2014, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania had the most bars per capita in the United States. =Former Yugoslavia= In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia, modern bars overlap with coffeehouses and larger ones are sometimes also nightclubs. Since the 1980s, they have become similar in social function to the bars of Italy, Spain and Greece, as meeting places for people in a city.

It was the 28th novel in the Discworld series but the first written for children. The story is a new take on the German fairy tale about the Pied Piper of Hamelin and a parody of the folk tale genre. Pratchett won the annual Carnegie Medal from the British librarians, recognising the year's best children's book published in the U.K. It was his first major award.  Series  Discworld had been a comic fantasy series for adults, beginning with The Colour of Magic in 1983. Amazing Maurice was marketed as a children's book, to be followed in that respect by The Wee Free Men (2003, #30). It differs from earlier Discworld novels also by its division into chapters, though chapters become far more common in later books of the series. Contrary to the contrast between adult and child markets, reflected in catalogues, The Guardian observed on the occasion of the Carnegie Medal that \\"[t]he main audience for Pratchett's 48 books, all busily in print, is teenagers, who are drawn by his irrepressible invention and sense of mischief.\\" Maurice and His Educated Rodents were not entirely new; they had been mentioned as early as Reaper Man (1991, #11). Plot summary The book opens with Amazing Maurice (a sentient cat), a group of talking rats (the Clan), and the human boy Keith travelling in a mail coach to a small town called Bad Blintz. The group plans to enact a scheme they have used many times before, where in the rats pretend to infest the town and Keith poses as a rat piper to lead the \\"vermin\\" away for a small sum of cash. Although Maurice sees nothing wrong with this hustling business, the rats find it immoral, and convince Maurice that this town will be the last one they rob. Upon arriving in town, the group discovers that the people are convinced of a massive rat infestation, and have spent much of their savings on two rat catchers. Despite their efforts, food continues to disappear from the town. As the rats move into the town's underground, they discover an overwhelmingly large number of rat traps, but no live keekees (rats who can't talk or think). Aboveground, Maurice makes similar observations, including that many of the rat tails the rat catchers display as proof of their successful hunting are in fact shoelaces. Maurice and Keith meet the mayor's daughter Malicia and introduce her to the talking rats. Malicia believes that the rat catchers are up to something and so she, Maurice, and Keith break into the rat catchers' hut. They discover a great deal of food stolen by the men and large cages when the local keekees are being bred for coursing. The rat catchers return and lock up the humans, taking away the rat leader Hamnpork who had met up with them. Maurice hides and feels a voice trying to enter his mind, inciting a great sense of fear. The rats of the Clan feel it too, and many become so afraid that they all but forget how to think and reason. Dangerous Beans, the rats' spiritual leader, is crushed by the realization that the rats are just mindless animals at heart, and leaves with his assistant Peaches. Darktan, the rats' trap expert, leads a group to rescue Hamnpork, and succeeds after nearly dying in a trap. Hamnpork dies of injuries sustained while fighting in the rat coursing pit, and Darktan reluctantly assumes control of the Clan. Malicia and Keith, after freeing themselves, trick the rat catchers into admitting their crimes. The rat catchers have created a powerful rat king named Spider, which is the source of the mysterious voice that has been plaguing the rats and Maurice. Using its mental control over the rat catchers, Spider plans to wage war on the humans that created it. It sends the rats it controls to attack Maurice, Peaches, and Dangerous Beans. However, Maurice (so terrified that he stops thinking and acts instinctively) pounces on the rat king and destroys it. Maurice emerges from Spider's chamber carrying the body of Dangerous Beans. When he is safely out, he collapses and dies. In ghostly form, he sees the Bone Rat coming for Dangerous Beans and makes a deal with the reoccurring personality in Discworld, Death – two of his remaining lives in exchange for both his life and the albino rat's. The rats corral all the keekees and block their ears. When the real rat piper arrives in town, Keith challenges him to a duel. The piper plays his \\"magic\\" rat pipe but none of the rats come out. Keith plays on a trombone and Sardines (an intelligent rat) emerges and dances for the crowd. Keith is proclaimed the winner, and leads the keekees out of town with the piper. After the piper leaves, the Clan rats emerge from hiding and tell the humans about the rat catchers' duplicity. The humans bargain with the rats: if the Clan will keep the keekees out of the town, the rats may stay and live as though they were just smaller humans. Keith decides to stay behind as Bad Blintz's ceremonial rat piper, while Maurice moves on to find a new scheme. =Characters= * Maurice – an intelligent cat who leads the group of rats. He is cunning and manipulative and has a very good (but cynical) understanding of how the world works. Late in the novel, he guiltily admits that he accidentally ate one of the intelligent rats of the Clan early in their history, and thus became sentient himself. * Malicia – the daughter of Bad Blintz's mayor, perennially obsessed with fairy tales, having adventures, and storytelling. * Keith – called the \\"stupid-looking kid\\", Keith is an orphan raised by the Musician's Guild. He goes along with Maurice's scheme mainly to have something to do, although he is very defensive of his rat family. * Dangerous Beans – an albino rat who has acted as a kind of spiritual leader for the Clan since they became intelligent after eating rubbish from behind Unseen University. Darktan observes that Dangerous Beans is the Clan's much-needed philosopher, finding and \\"disarming\\" dangerous ideas for the group. For example, Dangerous Beans is the one who they all turn to for answers to questions of rat cannibalism, stealing, and the phenomenon of dreaming. He is also the interpreter of the rats' \\"bible\\", a children's book called Mr Bunnsy Has An Adventure, which depicts rats and other animals living in harmony with humans, speaking and dressing like them. When Malicia observes that this book's utopian society is entirely fictional, Dangerous Beans and his assistant Peaches run off in despair. * Peaches – a small female rat who acts as Dangerous Beans' assistant and the Clan's scribe. * Hamnpork – the aging leader of the Clan, leftover from before they could think. Hamnpork resists the idea of \\"thinking\\" and leads the Clan through the brute force and cunning that traditional kee kee leaders use. * Darktan – the leader of the rats' Trap Disposal Squad. After his near-death experience and the death of Hamnpork, Darktan becomes the Clan's new leader. Darktan, although an older rat, is much more progressive than Hamnpork. He is well-respected by all the rats because his knowledge of how to disarm traps helps keep them alive. * Sardines – an older rat who wears a hat and tap dances. Sardines epitomizes the group of rats who harass the humans into thinking they have a full-blown infestation. He does not seek to lead but provides insightful help to Darktan after the latter becomes the leader of the Clan. He understands how to read both humans and rats and can manipulate both (but much more kindly than Maurice).  Recognition  Karen Usher, who chaired the panel of Carnegie judges, declared that the selection was unanimous: \\"This is an outstanding work of literary excellencea brilliant twist on the tale of the Pied Piper that is funny and irreverent, but also dark and subversive.\\" The Carnegie Medal for Maurice was Pratchett's first major award. The Guardian alluded to \\"16 years of disdain by the British literary establishment\\" and reported about his acceptance speech that he \\"rounded on\\" that establishment, \\"tilted at\\" Tolkien, and showed ambivalence about the fantasy label: \\"though his work dealt with profound themes, 'stick in one lousy dragon and they call you a fantasy writer'.\\" Ideas and themes All the rats' names derive from the words they have seen written on tins before they knew what the words meant, and they have called themselves whatever they thought sounded good. Pratchett puns on this, such as the doubting rat, who was called \\"Tomato\\" (as in Doubting Thomas). Adaptations * BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 90-minute dramatisation on 23 August 2003, which was repeated on BBC 7 on 2 June 2007 and 27 April 2008. The character of Dangerous Beans was voiced by David Tennant. Darktan's voice was a spoof version of Sean Connery's Scottish burr. The narrator in the adaptation was Maurice himself, describing to Dangerous Beans how they arrived at the perilous situation near the end of the plot. Quotes from Mr. Bunnsy Has an Adventure, which appear as chapter heads in the book, were read by Rebecca Norfolk, aged 8, who played \\"Child reader\\" in the BBC Radio 4 production. To mark the occasion of Terry Pratchett's knighthood, it was broadcast on BBC 7 again, along with other dramatizations of his work, in February 2009. * The book has been adapted for the stage twice: first by Stephen Briggs in 2003 and published by Oxford Playscripts, then in 2011 as a musical by Matthew Holmes, published by Collins Musicals. Both versions are designed for use in schools. * In June 2019, it was announced that an animated film adaptation is in the works. It will be a co-production between Ulysses Filmproduktion and Cantilever Media, with Terry Rossio writing the screenplay. The budget will be €15 million ($17 million).

He pursued a successful career as an actor-manager, specialising in debonair, often disreputable, parts in popular comedies. He occasionally played in Sheridan and other classics, but was generally associated with new works by writers including Oscar Wilde and Somerset Maugham. Born to a long-established county family, Hawtrey was one of three of his parents' five sons to pursue a theatrical career. Before going on the stage he had considered joining the army, but failed to apply himself to the necessary studies to qualify for a commission. Once established as an actor he quickly took on the additional role of a manager, boosted by an early success with his own adaptation of a German farce presented in London as The Private Secretary, which made his fortune. A lifelong gambler, both with theatrical productions and on horseracing, to which he was addicted, he was bankrupted several times during his career. Regarded as Britain's leading comedy actor of his generation, Hawtrey was mentor and role model to younger actors including Noël Coward. Towards the end of his career Hawtrey starred in a handful of silent movies. Early life Hawtrey was born at Slough and educated at Eton College, the fifth son and eighth of the ten children of the Rev. John William Hawtrey and his first wife, Frances Mary Anne, née Procter. The Hawtrey family had a long association with Eton; at the time of Hawtrey's birth his father was a housemaster there, and a cousin, Edward Craven Hawtrey, was Provost.Read, Michael, \\"Hawtrey, Sir Charles Henry (1858–1923)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, online edition, May 2008, accessed 27 Sept 2013 At the age of eight Hawtrey entered the lower school of the college. Three years later John Hawtrey left Eton to found St Michael's School, Slough; Hawtrey was educated there from 1869 to 1872, when he returned to Eton for a year, before moving to Rugby. As a schoolboy he became known as \\"a sportsman of dash and endurance\\". At the age of fourteen he became a keen follower of horse-racing, a lifelong obsession that continually disrupted his finances. He commented that his first encounter with racing was \\"a fatal day for me. I had one bet and lost half-a-crown, and I have been trying for fifty years to win it back.\\"Hawtrey, p. 32 From Rugby, Hawtrey went briefly to a crammer in London, to study for a career in the army, but soon abandoned the idea. He worked as a private tutor from 1876 to 1879 and then he began his theatrical career. It started badly: he broke his collar-bone while playing football and had to withdraw from the cast before the opening night.Hawtrey, p. 88 In February 1881 he matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, but withdrew in October, having been cast in the supporting role of Edward Langton in F. C. Burnand's The Colonel at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, London. Uncertain of success, he temporarily adopted the stage name Charles Bankes. He was well received in the play, and was given valuable lessons in stagecraft from the producer: Actor-manager In early 1882 Hawtrey played Jack Merryweather in The Marble Arch, which starred Herbert Beerbohm Tree. Later in that year he toured in The Colonel in a cast headed by Charles Collette.Morley, p. Two of Hawtrey's brothers, William and George, had also become actors, and in early 1883, Charles and William led a small touring company to towns in south-east England.Child, H H. \\"Hawtrey, Sir Charles Henry\\", Dictionary of National Biography, 1937, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography archive, accessed 27 September 2013 Hawtrey in what the Illustrated London News called \\"essentially a Charles Hawtrey part\\", in Inconstant George (1910) In 1884 Hawtrey had a huge success in London presenting his own adaptation of a German farce by Gustav von Moser, Der Bibliothekar, rewritten as The Private Secretary with the action moved to an English setting. It opened in March to disparaging reviews and at first played to small audiences, but Hawtrey persisted and further rewrote the play. It moved from the Prince's to the Globe Theatre, the principal roles were recast (with Hawtrey playing the crusty old Cattermole), and in the words of The Manchester Guardian \\"the audiences steadily laughed it into a success.\\"\\"Theatre Royal\\", The Manchester Guardian, 14 April 1885, p. 6 The production ran for 785 performances,Parker, p. 1198 and Hawtrey made £123,000 from it – an enormous sum for those days. The play was revived in London eight times during his life.Parker, p. 1153 Hawtrey pursued a career as an actor-manager, making a speciality of suave, sometimes immoral, but likable characters. His managerial career was chequered: great successes were often followed by expensive failures, and he was bankrupt several times. He was in charge over the years at eighteen London theatres – including the Globe until 1887 and two spells at the Comedy Theatre, 1887–93 and 1896–98. He staged, \\"with great attention to detail\\", about a hundred plays. His biographers H H Child and Michael Read list his most celebrated productions as two more adaptations from Moser (The Pickpocket, 1886, adapted by George Hawtrey, and The Arabian Nights, 1887, by Sydney Grundy); Jane (1890) by Harry Nicholls and William Lestocq; One Summer's Day (1897) by H. V. Esmond; Lord and Lady Algy (1898) by R. C. Carton; A Message from Mars (1899) by Richard Ganthony; The Man from Blankley's (1906) by F. Anstey; and Ambrose Applejohn's Adventure (1921) by Walter Hackett, in which Hawtrey played two roles: a respectable modern man and his disreputable ancestor. Hawtrey's career was long enough to allow him to create leading roles in plays by Oscar Wilde in the 1890s and Somerset Maugham after the First World War – he was Wilde's Lord Goring in An Ideal Husband (1895) and William in Maugham's Home and Beauty (1919). In between his successes he went bankrupt several times, and on one occasion discharged his debts by successfully gambling at baccarat.Morley, pp. 167–168 After the war Hawtrey appeared occasionally in silent films: A Message From Mars (1913) as Horace Parker, Honeymoon for Three (1915) as Prince Ferdinand, and Masks and Faces (1918) with George Alexander, George Bernard Shaw and J. M. Barrie. Poster from a performance of Hawtrey's The Private Secretary at the Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh in 1886 Hawtrey was generous in fostering talent. Among the young actors whose careers he encouraged was Noël Coward, who wrote in his memoirs about \\"the kindness and care of Hawtrey's direction. He took endless trouble with me ... and taught me during those two short weeks many technical points of comedy acting which I use to this day.\\"Coward, p. 66 Of the dramatists that he promoted was Horace Newte whose one act drama A Labour of Love Hawtrey presented at The Comedy Theatre in 1897.At the Play.

In 1909 his then partner, Olive Morris, bore him a son, Anthony Hawtrey. On 10 November 1919 Hawtrey married the Hon Mrs Albert Petre (née Katherine Elsie Clark), daughter of the Rev William Robinson Clark and widow of the youngest son of the 11th Baron Petre. There were no children of either of his marriages. His second wife died on 14 November 1930. According to Ada Coleman, head bartender at the Savoy Hotel London, Hawtrey was responsible for naming the Hanky-Panky cocktail, which she created specifically for him. Last years and posterity From 1920 Hawtrey's health deteriorated.Morley, p. 169 He was knighted in 1922 and died on 30 July 1923 and is buried at Richmond. His memoirs were edited by Maugham and published in 1924 as The Truth at Last.Hawtrey, passim The later comic actor named Charles Hawtrey was no relation of Hawtrey; he was born George Hartree, and took Hawtrey's name as a stage name.Lewis, Roger.

Sections of the story were adapted from Egan's 1992 short story \\"Dust\\", which dealt with many of the same philosophical themes.Aurealis Interview (2009) by Russell Blackford . Permutation City won the John W. Campbell Award for the best science-fiction novel of the year in 1995 and was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award the same year. The novel was also cited in a 2003 Scientific American article on multiverses by Max Tegmark.Max Tegmark, Parallel Universes, Scientific American, May 2003.Max Tegmark, Parallel Universes. Themes and setting Permutation City asks whether there is a difference between a computer simulation of a person and a \\"real\\" person. It focuses on a model of consciousness and reality, the Dust Theory, similar to the Ultimate Ensemble Mathematical Universe hypothesis proposed by Max Tegmark. It uses the assumption that human consciousness is Turing-computable: that consciousness can be produced by a computer program. The book deals with consequences of human consciousness being amenable to mathematical manipulation, as well as some consequences of simulated realities. In this way, Egan attempts to deconstruct notions of self, memory, and mortality, and of physical reality. The Autoverse is an artificial life simulator based on a cellular automaton complex enough to represent the substratum of an artificial chemistry. It is deterministic, internally consistent and vaguely resembles real chemistry. Tiny environments, simulated in the Autoverse and filled with populations of a simple, designed lifeform, Autobacterium lamberti, are maintained by a community of enthusiasts obsessed with getting A. lamberti to evolve, something the Autoverse chemistry seems to make extremely difficult. Related explorations go on in virtual realities (VR), which make extensive use of patchwork heuristics to crudely simulate immersive and convincing physical environments, albeit at a maximal speed of seventeen times slower than \\"real\\" time, limited by the optical crystal computing technology used at the time of the story. Larger VR environments, covering a greater internal volume in greater detail, are cost-prohibitive even though VR worlds are computed selectively for inhabitants, reducing redundancy and extraneous objects and places to the minimal details required to provide a convincing experience to those inhabitants; for example, a mirror not being looked at would be reduced to a reflection value, with details being \\"filled in\\" as necessary if its owner were to turn their model-of-a-head towards it. Within the story, \\"Copies\\" – digital renderings of human brains with complete subjective consciousness, the technical descendants of ever more comprehensive medical simulations – live within VR environments after a process of \\"scanning\\". Copies are the only objects within VR environments that are simulated in full detail, everything else being produced with varying levels of generalisation, lossy compression, and hashing at all times. Copies form the conceptual spine of the story, and much of the plot deals directly with the \\"lived\\" experience of Copies, most of whom are copies of wealthy billionaires suffering terminal illnesses or fatal accidents, who spend their existences in VR worlds of their creating, usually maintained by trust funds, which independently own and operate large computing resources for their sakes, separated physically and economically from most of the rest of the world's computing power, which is privatized as a fungible commodity. Although the wealthiest copies face no financial difficulties, they can still be threatened because copies lack political and legal rights (they are considered software), especially where the global economy is in recession. Hence they cannot afford to retreat into solipsism and ignore what is happening in the real world. At the opposite end from the wealthy Copies are those who can only afford to live in the virtual equivalent of \\"Slums\\", being bounced around the globe to the cheapest physical computing available at any given time in order to save money, while running at much slower speeds compared to the wealthy Copies. Their slowdown rate depends on how much computer power their meager assets can afford, as computer power is traded on a global exchange and goes to the highest bidder at any point in time. When they cannot afford to be \\"run\\" at all, they can be frozen as a \\"snapshot\\" until computer power is relatively affordable again. A Copy whose financial assets can only generate sufficient interest to run at a very slow rate is stuck in a rut because he/she/it becomes unemployable and is unable to generate new income, which may lead to a downward spiral. By creating this scenario, Egan postulates a world where economic inequality can persist even in one's (virtual) afterlife. The concept of solipsism is also examined prominently, with many less-wealthy Copies attending social functions called Slow Clubs, where socialising Copies agree to synchronise with the slowest person present. Many of these less-wealthy Copies become completely deracinated from their former lives and from world events, or else become Witnesses, who spend their time observing (at considerable time lapse) world events unfold, at the cost of any meaningful relationships with their fellow Copies. A subculture of lower/middle-class Copies, calling themselves Solipsist Nation after a philosophical work by their nominal founder, choose to completely repudiate the \\"real\\" world and any Copies still attached to it, reprogramming their models-of-brains and their VR environments in order to design themselves into their own personal vision of paradise, of whatever size and detail, disregarding slowdown in the process. Egan's later novels Diaspora and Schild's Ladder deal with related issues from other perspectives. Story The plot of Permutation City follows the lives of several people in a near future reality where the Earth is ravaged by the effects of climate change, the economy and culture are largely globalised, and civilisation has accumulated vast amounts of cloud computing power and memory which is distributed internationally and is traded in a public market called the QIPS Exchange (Quadrillion Instructions Per Second, see MIPS). Most importantly, this great computing capacity has enabled the creation of Copies, whole brain emulations of \\"scanned\\" humans which are detailed enough to allow for subjective conscious experience on the part of the emulation. Scanning has become safe enough and common enough to allow for a few wealthy or dedicated humans to afford to create backups of themselves. Copies do not yet possess human rights under the laws of any nation or international body. =Part one= In 2050, Paul Durham, a Sydney man having experimented on Copies of himself, offers wealthy Copies prime real estate in an advanced supercomputer which, according to his pitch, will never be shut down and never experience any slowdown whatsoever. Durham predicts that efforts to utilise chaotic effects will clash with Copy rights, as both Copies and weather simulations will demand increasing QIPS Exchange shares. All that each Copy must do is to make the comparatively small investment of two million euros in order to bring Durham's fantasy computer into existence. Durham hires Maria Deluca, an Autoverse enthusiast, to design an Autoverse program which, given a powerful enough computer, could generate a planet's worth of evolvable Autoverse life. He also clandestinely commissions a famous virtual reality architect, Malcolm Carter, to build a full scale VR city; outside of Durham's knowledge, Carter secretly hacks two Slum-dwelling Solipsist Nation Copies (Peer and Kate) into this city's machine code. When Maria learns of a computer fraud investigation on Durham, she confronts him. Durham reveals that his self-experiments convinced him that there is no difference, even in principle, between physics and mathematics, and that all mathematically possible structures exist, among them our physics and therefore our spacetime, a belief he refers to as \\"Dust Theory\\". The dust theory implies that all possible universes exist and are equally real, emerging spontaneously from their own mathematical self- consistency. Because Copies exist in virtual realities held together by heuristics merely for the sake of their experience, it should be the case that when a Copy is terminated and deleted, its own conscious experience will continue. Indeed, Durham himself claims to have been through such a process dozens of times. Durham uses the money from his financial backing to simulate a minute or two of a \\"Garden of Eden\\" configuration of an infinitely- expanding, massively complex cellular automaton universe, in which each iteration of the expansion serves to \\"manufacture\\" an extra layer of blocks of a computing configuration.This is similar to what is known as a \\"Spacefiller\\" configuration in Conway's Game of Life) based on a fictional, Turing-complete cellular automaton and referred to as a TVC (\\"Turing/Von Neumann/Chiang\\"), named after its conceiver and designer. According to his Dust Theory, such a simulation would create a self-consistent \\"TVC universe\\" to persist in its own terms even after its termination and deletion. His and his investors' Copies would therefore persist indefinitely in the simulation. The Autoverse planetary seed program designed by Maria is included in the TVC universe package for his investors to explore once life had evolved there after it had been run on a significantly large segment of the TVC universe (referred to as \\"Planet Lambert\\"). After a successful launch, simulation, termination, and deletion of the TVC universe, Durham and Maria have uncomfortable sex in awkward celebration, and later that night, while Maria is asleep, Durham disembowels himself with a kitchen knife in his bathtub, believing his role as the springboard for his deleted TVC Copy to discover its true identity to be fulfilled. =Part two= Maria wakes in Permutation City seven thousand years of subjective time after the launch, furious at Durham for awakening her. He explains to her that intelligent life has arisen on Planet Lambert in the form of complex swarms of insect-like eusocial beings, evolved from Maria's original Autobacterium hydrophilus. He wishes to use Maria's slice of the universe's processing power (as a founder of the world she was given de facto control of a continuously-growing zone of the processor network as well) to make forbidden first contact with Lambertians. He believes this is necessary because he has lost the ability to pause the Autoverse simulation or slow it down past a constant multiple of the size of the processor network it occupies. Durham is worried that the rules of their simulated universe are breaking down. They discover that the combined intelligence of Lambertians has exceeded that of Permutation City; as such, the TVC universe is being overwritten into a system existing solely as a byproduct of the self- perpetuation of the Autoverse. Durham, Maria, and some other companions quickly launch an emergency expedition into the Autoverse to attempt to convince the Lambertians of the validity of the creator hypothesis and its methodological preferentiality over their own newly formulated theory. Unfortunately, the Lambertians reject the creator theory, prompting Permutation City and the entirety of TVC processor-networks to begin collapsing into nothing. Durham and Maria inform the inhabitants of Permutation City, who launch a new TVC Garden of Eden in their universe's final moments. Maria convinces a reluctant Durham to come along to a new universe, pledging to work with her to discover the underlying rules that governed the Autoverse's takeover of Permutation City.

The various annexes define hazardous waste in Canada, and also deem any waste that is \\"...considered or defined as hazardous under the legislation of the country receiving it and is prohibited by that country from being imported or conveyed in transit\\" to be covered under Canadian regulation and therefore subject to prior informed consent procedures.Export and Import of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Recyclable Material Regulations. Laws- lois.justice.gc.ca (May 2, 2012).Environment Canada – Pollution and Waste – Basel Convention. Ec.gc.ca. The loophole in the regulations that allows tons of e-waste to be exported from Canada is the use of the definition of \\"intact\\" vs \\"functional\\". A non-functioning electronic device that is intact can be exported under the current legislation. What can't be exported without prior informed consent is a non-functioning but no longer intact electronic device (if the component pieces are deemed hazardous). The principal problem being, the non-functioning but intact electronic device is at high risk of being disassembled in some far away e-waste dumping ground. The Canadian government's use of a unique interpretation of the Basel Convention obligations \\"intact\\" and \\"not intact\\" opens the door to uncontrolled e-waste exports as long as the device is intact. See Canadian fact sheet and associated links. Since Canada ratified the Basel Convention on August 28, 1992, and as of August 2011, the Enforcement Branch has initiated 176 investigations for violations under EIHWHRMR, some of which are still in progress. There have been 19 prosecutions undertaken for non-compliance with the provisions of the EIHWHRMR some of which are still before the courts. Electronic waste by country  2012 Budget Bill C-38, the Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act  Bill C-38, (June 2012), replaced the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA 1992, 1999) with the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012. The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, Species at Risk Act, The National Energy Board Act, the Canadian Oil and Gas Operations Act, the Nuclear Safety and Control Act, the Fisheries Act (for example, closing the Experimental Lakes Area) all underwent major changes under Bill-38. By placing the emphasis on jobs, growth and prosperity significant changes have been made to the federal environmental assessment regime (EA) and environmental regulatory framework.  Minister of the Environment and the Kyoto Accord  In December 2011, Minister of the Environment Peter Kent announced Canada's withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol one day after negotiators from nearly 200 countries meeting in Durban, South Africa at the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference (November 28 – December 11), completed a marathon of climate talks to establish a new treaty to limit carbon emissions.[1] The Durban talks were leading to a new binding treaty with targets for all countries to take effect in 2020. Kent argued that, \\"The Kyoto protocol does not cover the world's largest two emitters, the United States and China, and therefore cannot work.\\" In 2010 Canada, Japan and Russia said they would not accept new Kyoto commitments. Canada is the only country to repudiate the Kyoto Accord. Kent argued that since Canada could not meet targets, it needed to avoid the $14 billion in penalties for not achieving its goals. This decision drew widespread international response.CBC News http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2011/12/canadas-kyoto-withdrawal-draws- international-response.html States for which the emissions are not covered by the Kyoto Protocol (the US and China) have the largest emissions, being responsible for 41% of the Kyoto Protocol. China's emissions increased by over 200% from 1990 to 2009.

The typical cost for an hour of play ranges from 500 to 1500 KRW (approximately $0.43 to $1.29 USD in October 2020), with 1000 KRW per hour being the most common rate. Although the per capita penetration of personal computers and broadband internet access in South Korea is one of the highest in the world, PC bangs remain popular as they provide a social meeting place for gamers (especially school-aged gamers) to play together with their peers. Aside from the social aspect, PC bangs' ability to offer access to expensive and powerful high-end personal computers (better known as Gaming PCs), designed specifically for video gaming, at a comparatively low price has also bolstered their popularity. History The origin of PC bang starts with 전자 카페('jeonja kape', which literally translates to 'electronic cafe') in South Korea opened in March 1988, which was then closed in 1991. The original creators of the junja kappeh, Ahn Sang-Soo and Geum Nu-Ree, launched this electronic cafe next to Hongik University. At the time, people were able to use two 16-bit computers, which were connected by a telephone line. However, it was only known to locals and not widely known, yet. In April 1994, the first Internet cafe was opened. Jung Min-Ho founded the first public Internet cafe, named BNC, in 서초구 (Seocho District). It gained immense popularity, a first for such type of cafe. From 1988 to 1993, the press had labeled such cafes as \\"electronic cafe\\"; however, after the opening of BNC, labels such as \\"modem cafe\\", \\"network cafe\\", and \\"cyber cafe\\" have been introduced by the press. Industry The most played games in PC bangs are known as massively multiplayer online role-playing games, in which more than 100,000 people around the globe can play at the same time. PC bangs rose to popularity following the release of the PC game StarCraft in 1998. At the time South Korea had a thriving computer industry with Internet use reaching over 50% of the population. , 25 million citizens were using the Internet, and 14.4 million Korean homes were equipped with Internet access. Accompanying this high rate of home Internet access it is estimated the number of PC bangs grew from 100 to 25,000 between 1997 and 2011.Larissa Hjorth. Games and Gaming: An Introduction to New Media. Bloomsbury, 2011 Many popular Korean multiplayer games provide players with incentives which encourage them to play from a PC bang. For example, the Nexon games Kart Rider and BnB reward players with bonus \\"Lucci\\" — the games' virtual currencies — when they log on from a PC bang. Demographics Although PC bangs are used by all ages and genders, they are most popular with male gamers in their teens and twenties. Throughout the day, the demographics of the PC room change. Most PC rooms are open 24 hours. In the mornings, the primary type of user is an adult male, between 30 and 50. During the afternoons, young males come in groups between 1-3 pm. During this time is when PC bangs are the noisiest. Around dinner time, teenagers and young adults come in. They usually play online card, arcade, or MMORPG games. Competitive game players (ages 18 and up) start coming in at 8pm and usually stay for several hours or all night. League of Legends, Lineage II, Sudden Attack and Starcraft are the most popular games for late-night players. Social aspect PC bang industry has created a culture that is participated in by most youth in South Korea. Gamers have turned the PC bang into a socialization facility, becoming a huge part in the lives of the Korean youth today. Many students have suggested that the PC-Bang provides a stress free, fun and youth dominated environment where groups of friends can meet and engage in a cooperative game. They have suggested that the games themselves may promote a social environment by promoting the development of squads or groups of players to play the game more effectively. Addiction With computer and Internet access so readily available to the public, both at home and at PC bangs, gaming addiction has become a concern. The consequences of several hours spent at the PC bang gaming and the strong need to compete causes increased addiction and displacement problems of the Korean PC bang users. The biggest displacements due to addiction include sleep, school, homework, promises to meet with friends and time spent with friends. As part of its efforts to battle online game addictions among teenagers, South Korea introduced a law that prohibits those aged 16 and under from playing online games between midnight and 6 a.m. The law mainly targets PC online games as well as consoles with online features. It allows a two-year grace period for smartphone and tablet PC games before reconsidering if they should be included, as online game addictions on those platforms are not currently considered a serious problem.S. korea implements law to combat teenagers computer game addictions. (November 21, 2011). Retrieved from http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-11/21/c_131260602.htm Industry impact South Korean PC bangs have been identified as the source of a large number of players that use software tools to cheat in the video game Overwatch, effectively making play on Asian servers for the game unenjoyable for others. The game's publisher Blizzard Entertainment has arranged deals with many PC bangs to allow anyone using the site to play Overwatch without purchasing the game as part of the hourly fee. Because of the competitive and youthful nature of the average PC bang user, many of these players use tools like aimbots to gain the upper edge in Overwatch matches as to show off to friends. While Blizzard does ban accounts from using these types of hacks, PC bang users can quickly make a new Battle.net account and jump back into the game, using the same tools. Blizzard reports handling thousands of such bans a day from South Korea. From February 2017 onward, Blizzard requires Korean players to log into a Battle.net account as to other play Overwatch and other Blizzard games. As creating a Battle.net account requires unique personal information including difficult-to-spoof Korean social security numbers, Blizzard anticipates this will limit creation of throwaway accounts and alleviate the situation.

He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Tipperary North constituency from 1969 to 1981, 1982 to 1992 and 1997 to 2002. He was a Senator for the Cultural and Educational Panel from 1965 to 1969, and for the Administrative Panel from 1993 to 1997. Early life O'Kennedy was born in Nenagh, County Tipperary into a family that had strong links to Sinn Féin and the Old IRA. He was educated locally at St. Mary's national school before later attending St. Flannan's College in Ennis, County Clare. He briefly studied for the priesthood at St Patrick's College, Maynooth, where he was a contemporary of future Social Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume. After securing first place in a university scholarship in 1953, O'Kennedy obtained an MA degree from University College Dublin. He taught in Switzerland for a while, before resuming his legal studies; he was subsequently called to the Bar in 1961. Twelve years later he was appointed Senior Counsel. Political career =Beginnings= O'Kennedy joined Fianna Fáil in 1957, and became an active member of the party. He contested the 1965 general election in Tipperary North, however, he narrowly failed to win a seat. He later secured election to Seanad Éireann where he became party spokesperson on a range of issues including finance and education. O'Kennedy contested the 1969 general election and was successful in securing a seat in Dáil Éireann. He remained on the backbenches until 1970, when the Arms Crisis resulted in a major reshuffle at cabinet and junior ministerial levels. O'Kennedy became Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education. In December 1972, a cabinet reshuffle by Taoiseach Jack Lynch saw O'Kennedy join the cabinet as Minister without portfolio. There was much speculation as to what portfolio he would take, however, the new year saw him become Minister for Transport and Power. His tenure was short-lived, for the 1973 general election saw a Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition government come to power. Immediately after Fianna Fáil's loss of power O'Kennedy was appointed Spokesperson on Foreign Affairs. He retained the same brief in a 1975 front bench reshuffle. It was after this reshuffle that he revealed his future leadership aspirations as he became associated with a hardline policy document regarding Northern Ireland. The document called for a complete and immediate withdrawal of the British Government from Northern Ireland. This new policy opened up the old divisions in Fianna Fáil that had come to light during the Arms Crisis in 1970. It was also against the wishes of the party and was at odds with party policy; however, O'Kennedy's new policy was welcomed by the hardline Republican element at grassroots level within the party. =Cabinet Minister and European Commissioner= The 1977 general election saw Fianna Fáil return to power with a massive twenty-seat majority in the Dáil. O'Kennedy was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in Jack Lynch's new cabinet. In 1979, Lynch suddenly announced his resignation as Taoiseach and as Fianna Fáil leader. The subsequent leadership contest was a straight battle between George Colley and Charles Haughey. Colley was the favoured choice of the outgoing leadership and of the majority of the cabinet, while Haughey had the backing of a large rump of backbench TDs who had become disillusioned with the party leadership. On the day before the crucial vote, O'Kennedy came out as the only cabinet minister to publicly endorse Haughey. Many believe that it was because of this support that Haughey was successful in becoming Taoiseach, albeit by a narrow margin of just six votes. O'Kennedy's loyalty was rewarded when he was appointed Minister for Finance in the new government. O'Kennedy's tenure as Minister for Finance was short- lived, delivering a stringent budget, as he took up the position of European Commissioner in January 1981. Because of his new appointment in Brussels he also resigned his Dáil seat. O'Kennedy took over as European Commissioner for Personnel, Administration and the Statistics Office and was disappointed not to be made Vice-President in the Thorn Commission. He was, however, made delegate to the President. O'Kennedy's tenure in the European Commission was an unhappy one. He quickly grew bored of the mundane day-to-day work as a Commissioner and missed the cut-and-thrust nature of Irish politics, which was going through a particularly unstable period. A general election was called for February 1982 and O'Kennedy decided to return to contest his old seat. His gamble paid off as he was returned to the Dáil for Tipperary North once again and he resigned as a European Commissioner. O'Kennedy's return was seen as an attempt to assert his claim to the future leadership of Fianna Fáil, something that had been a contentious issue under Haughey and his failure to secure an overall majority in two elections. Fianna Fáil returned to power with the help of a number of Independent TDs and O'Kennedy demanded a senior government position. His request was refused. Haughey did offer him the post of Attorney General but O'Kennedy declined. As a result, he was left out of the short- lived administration. The government fell in October of that same year, and Fianna Fáil lost power at the subsequent general election. A period of instability followed within Fianna Fáil as a number of TDs attempted to oust Charles Haughey as party leader. Desmond O'Malley was seen as the clear front- runner to succeed Haughey, however, O'Kennedy's name was also mentioned alongside other party stalwarts like Gerry Collins and Brian Lenihan. In the end Haughey survived as party leader. =Return to cabinet= Following the 1987 general election, Haughey was again Taoiseach and O'Kennedy returned to the cabinet as Minister for Agriculture and Food. For someone with the experience of O'Kennedy this may have seemed like a demotion, however, his near five-year tenure received praise from farming circles. In November 1991, tensions arose within Fianna Fáil regarding the continued leadership of Haughey. Minister for Finance Albert Reynolds directly challenged the party leader and Taoiseach, however, the challenge failed. O'Kennedy supported the incumbent leader throughout the heave, and took over as Minister for Labour in the subsequent reshuffle. Once again this was viewed as a demotion, however, O'Kennedy viewed his role as one of the most important in the cabinet considering the high rate of unemployment. In February 1992, Haughey eventually stepped down as Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader and Albert Reynolds won the subsequent leadership election by a large majority. The formation of his new cabinet caused widespread shock as O'Kennedy and seven of his cabinet colleagues were effectively sacked in favour of supporters of the new Taoiseach. This effectively brought his cabinet career to an end. =Later years= Worse was to follow as O'Kennedy lost his seat at the 1992 general election, in what turned out to be a disaster for Fianna Fáil. He subsequently secured election to Seanad Éireann for the second time in his career. O'Kennedy was re-elected to the Dáil at the 1997 general election. That same year he sought the Fianna Fáil nomination for President of Ireland, but received only 21 votes out of a total of 112, as Mary McAleese became the party's nominee and eventual victor of the election. After the 2002 general election O'Kennedy retired from national politics. He returned to work as a barrister and subsequently became a member of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.

It is often distinguished from \\"micropower broadcasting\\" (more commonly \\"microbroadcasting\\") and broadcast translators. LPAM, LPFM and LPTV are in various levels of use across the world, varying widely based on the laws and their enforcement. Canada Radio communications in Canada are regulated by the Radio Communications and Broadcasting Regulatory Branch, a branch of Industry Canada, in conjunction with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Interested parties must apply for both a certificate from Industry Canada and a license from CRTC in order to operate a radio station. Industry Canada manages the technicalities of spectrum space and technological requirements whereas content regulation is conducted more so by CRTC. LPFM is broken up into two classes in Canada, Low (50 watts) and Very Low (10 watts). The transmitters therefore range from 1 to 50 watts, as opposed to 1 to 100 watts in the U.S. , 500 licenses (very low and low-power FM) have been issued. These transmitters are generally only allowed in remote areas. Stations in the low- power class are subject to the same CRTC licensing requirements, and will generally follow the same call sign format, as full-power stations. Stations in the very low-power class formerly had to have CRTC licenses as well, although a series of CRTC regulation changes in the early 2000s exempted most such stations from licensing; a station in this class will usually not have a conventional call sign, but will instead be identified in a naming format consisting of a four-digit number preceded by the letters CH for a television station or VF for a radio station. The regulation of spectrum space is strict in Canada, as well having restrictions on second and third adjacent channels, along with other protections for AM and FM commercial radio. In addition, because there have been a few cases that found that FM frequencies have caused interference to the aeronautical navigation and communications (NAV/COM) spectrum (though evidence is not very concrete presently), pirate radio regulation has remained very strict as well. However, the two regulating bodies do have certain exemptions. For example, low-power announcement transmitters that meet the requirement of Broadcasting Equipment Technical Standards 1, Limited Duration Special Events Distribution Undertakings, Temporary Resource Development Distribution Undertakings, and Public Emergency Radio Undertakings are a few instances, which according to certain criteria, may be exempt from certificate/license requirements. In Canada, there is no formal transmission power below which a television transmitter is broadcasting at low power. Industry Canada, in most cases, considers a television transmitter to be low-power if the noise-limited bounding contours are less than 20 km from the antenna. New Zealand In New Zealand residents are allowed to broadcast licence free-of-charge at a maximum of 1 watt EIRP in the FM guardbands from 87.6 to 88.3 and from 106.7 to 107.7 MHz under a General User Radio License (GURL), which is issued by Radio Spectrum Management, managed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Prior to June 2010, the lower band was located between 88.1 and 88.8 and a maximum of 500 mW EIRP allowed. Broadcasters on these frequencies are required to cease operations if they interfere with other, licensed broadcasters and have no protection from interference from other licensed or unlicensed broadcasters. Contact details must also be broadcast every hour. Further restrictions are in place for the protection of aeronautical services. Use of the following frequencies is not permitted within certain boundaries approaching Auckland and Wellington airports:https://www.rsm.govt.nz/about-rsm/pdf-and-documents- library/spectrum-policy/official-information-notices-gazette/gurl-notices/low- power-fm-broadcasting/radiocommunications-regulations-general-user-radio- licence-for-low-power-fm-broadcasting-notice-2010.pdf 107.5 to 107.7 FM and 107.0 to 107.3, respectively. There exists a 25 km broadcast translator rule: one licensee may operate two transmitters anywhere (close together), but a third transmitter must be at least 25 km away from at least one of the first two transmitters. There are efforts on self-regulation of the broadcasters themselves. The NZRSM Radio Inspectors do, however, regularly monitor and make random unannounced visits to broadcasters, and will impose fines for violations of the regulations. New broadcasters are also subject to an initial compulsory inspection. United Kingdom Temporary low-power stations are allowed at times via a Restricted Service Licence. Since 2001, long-term LPFM licences have been available in remote areas of the country. These are currently used for many establishments, including military bases, universities and hospitals with fixed boundaries. United States =FM radio= Low Power FM (LPFM) is a non-commercial educational broadcast radio service created by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States in 2000. LPFM licenses, which are limited to a maximum effective radiated power (ERP) of 100 watts, may be issued to non-commercial educational entities, as well as public safety and transportation organizations. Individuals and holders of other types of broadcast licenses are not eligible. In addition, LPFM stations are not protected from interference from other classes of FM stations. LPFM classes * Class L1 (LP100) is to 100 watts effective radiated power (ERP). () * Class L2 (L10) is at least 1 and up to 10 watts ERP. () In addition, Class D educational licenses exist for stations of 10 watts transmitter power output (TPO) or less, regardless of ERP. These stations are all grandfathered operations, as no new licenses of this type have been issued since 1978, except in Alaska. They are not considered to be LPFM stations, although they operate noncommercially and have similar coverage areas to Class L2 stations. Legislation =Origins of LPFM= In January 2000, the Federal Communications Commission established Low Power FM (LPFM) as a new designated class of radio station. These stations were allowed to operate at 1–10 or 50–100 watts of power, compared to the minimum requirement for commercial stations at 100 watts. (). Originally, it was supported by activists and groups associated with American progressivism; music artists (such as Bonnie Raitt); religious leaders/churches (such as the United Church of Christ); and educators (for example, American Library Association, the Communication Workers of America labor union, the National League of Cities). The original purpose of LPFM was to serve as an alternative to \\"radio homogenization\\", as described in the J&MC; Quarterly Journal, as \\"... Necessary to offset the growing consolidation of station ownership in the wake of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which removed caps on radio ownership, as well as the decline of locally produced radio programming.\\" The main opposition to LPFMs came from the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), which opposed the act on grounds to \\"maintain spectrum integrity\\" for commercial broadcasting, according to NAB President Edward O. Fritts. =Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000= Pressure from the National Association of Broadcasters urged Congress to slip the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000 into a general spending bill that circulated through Congress. President Bill Clinton signed the bill in December 2000. The actual bill that went through Congress was meant to tighten standards for LPFM stations, in an effort to make it harder for stations to be approved in order to protect full-power FM stations had these provisions: # The FCC has the ability and jurisdiction to license LPFM stations. # Third adjacent channel interference protections require LPFM stations to be separated by at least 0.6 MHz from all other stations with the intent of preventing signal interference. # Applicants who have engaged in the unlicensed operation of any station cannot receive LPFM licenses. # The FCC agreed to commission studies on the interference effects and economic impact of LPFM on full-power stations (the findings, later published in the MITRE Corporation Report, suggest that third adjacent channel interference protections may not be necessary). This act shifted policy making from the FCC to Congress, which was considered an insult against the FCC. (Stavisky, Alan G., Robert K. Avery, and Helena Vanhala. \\"From Class D to LPFM: The High- Powered Politics of Low-Power Radio.\\" Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly 78 (2001): 340–54.) =Local Community Radio Act of 2005= The Local Community Radio Act of 2005 was introduced by Senators John McCain, Maria Cantwell and Patrick Leahy. After the FCC complied with the provisions of the Radio Broadcasting Act of 2000 by commissioning the MITRE Report to test if there was significant interference from LPFM stations on the full- power stations, the study showed that the interference of LPFM is minimal and would not have a significant effect on other stations. According to Sen. Leahy, \\"This bill will open up the airwaves to truly local broadcasting while protecting full-power broadcasters from unreasonable interference and preserving important services such as reading services for the blind.\\" =Local Community Radio Act of 2007= Sponsored in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressmen Mike Doyle and Lee Terry and in the United States Senate by Senators Maria Cantwell and John McCain, the Local Community Radio Act of 2007 failed to be voted on. The House bill, H.R. 2802, was referred to the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet on June 21, 2007. Since the bill was not passed in FY 2007, the bill was removed from the docket as Never Passed. =Local Community Radio Act of 2009= This bill was an update of the Local Community Radio Act of 2007. It would have required the FCC to alter current rules in order to get rid of the minimum distance separation between low-power FM stations and third-adjacent channel stations. Previously, there was a minimum distance requirement; however the FCC found that LPFM stations did not cause any interference on third-adjacent channel stations, thus eliminating the need for such a requirement. The Local Community Radio Act of 2009 also would have required that the FCC keep the rules that offer interference protection to third-adjacent channels that offer a radio reading service (the reading of newspapers, books or magazines for those who are blind or hearing impaired). This protection will ensure that such channels are not subject to possible interference by LPFM stations. The final part of the bill required that when giving out licenses to FM stations, the FCC must make sure that these licenses are also available to LPFM stations and that licensing decisions are made with regard to local community needs. The bill had unanimous bipartisan support from FCC leadership. It was passed by the House and referred to the Senate. =Local Community Radio Act of 2010= The Local Community Radio Act of 2010 (based upon the legislation originally introduced in 2005) was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 4, 2011 as , after passage in the House on December 17, 2010, and the U.S. Senate on December 18, 2010. In a statement after the bill became law, Federal Communications Commission chairman Julius Genachowski said, \\"Low power FM stations are small, but they make a giant contribution to local community programming. This important law eliminates the unnecessary restrictions that kept these local stations off the air in cities and towns across the country.\\" The Act states that the Federal Communications Commission, when licensing new FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations, should ensure that licenses are available to FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations; such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community; and FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations remain equal in status and secondary to existing and modified full-service FM stations. In general, the FCC was to modify its rules to eliminate third- adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between low-power FM stations; and full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations. Arguments for LPFM *Free Press, a non-partisan advocacy organization pushing for media reform, specifically in promoting \\"diversity and independent media ownership, strong public media, and universal access to communications,\\" voiced its support of LPFM for a variety of reasons: ** It strengthens community identity. ** It creates an outlet for amateur musicians to get their music heard. ** It creates diversity on the air because women and racial minorities are represented. ** It creates an opportunity for young people, especially college students, who are interested in radio to learn about the business. ** It provides farmers with up to date agricultural information. *Prometheus Radio Project, a non-profit organization that \\"builds, supports, and advocates for community radio stations which empower participatory community voices and movements for social change,\\" also supported LPFM, citing these reasons: ** The media should not limit democratic participation but should provide a way for communities and movements to express themselves ** Public airwaves shouldn't be concentrated in private/corporate hands ** Low Power FM gives a voice to communities ** Low Power FM needs to be protected from big broadcasters A New York Times article focusing on a LPFM station, KOCZ-LP, highlights a number of key arguments favoring low-powered broadcasting: * \\"In Louisiana, a large African-American community appreciates how LPFM plays a genre of music called zydeco, a potent blend of Cajun, rhythm and blues and, among a younger generation, hip-hop, often features accordion and washboard.“ * LPFM influences commercial radio to offer listeners a wider range of music. “Commercial stations had started playing more zydeco since KOCZ started broadcasting in 2002. 'They know that we make them better,' an advocate said.” * Because LPFM is non-commercial, schools and organizations are able to promote many projects that help serve the local community. \\"KOCZ is licensed to the Southern Development Foundation, a civil rights group that grants scholarships and runs a business incubator but has fallen on hard times. The foundation treats the station as a 24-hour form of community outreach. \\" * LPFM promotes a very close community. \\"A woman walked into the station ... asked for an announcement to be broadcast about her lost dog... 'She was able to get her dog back the next day’” * LPFM is crucial for small communities in times of emergencies. “A low power FM radio station can stay on the air even if the power goes out. Low power FM saved lives during Katrina.” Former President Bill Clinton has also become an advocate of LPFM for \\"giving voice to the voiceless\\", including schools, community-based organizations, churches, and ethnic groups. Brown Paper Tickets CEO Steve Butcher supports LPFM, stating in a letter to the FCC, \\"We hear from event producers frequently who can't afford radio ad buys on commercial stations. These local entrepreneurs can afford underwriting on smaller stations that can help build awareness about their events.\\" LPFM stations are considered to be affordable compared to an average FM station, whose operating costs can run up to a million dollars, and could only afforded by businesses and the very wealthy. An antenna and transmitter can cost between $2,000 and $5,000. Arguments against LPFM * Signal interference on FM station – High-power FM stations express concern that LPFM stations may cause interference with their signals if third adjacent-channel interference protections are not observed. While the Mitre Report suggests that the likelihood for interference is not as threatening as previously thought, high-power FM stations question the methodology, scope and validity of the study and its results. * FM translators – These devices allow a radio station to rebroadcast its signal to reach a greater area. FM translators could benefit religious broadcasters wishing to reach a larger audience, as well as many AM radio stations who, due to ionospheric refraction, are required to emit weaker signals during the night. FM translators are low- power, so compete with LPFM for limited space on the airwaves. * In some states, the local Department of Transportation operates large networks of LPFM stations that act as highway advisory radio stations – a service traditionally operated at the fringes of the AM band – restricting the number of available channels (these systems can be licensed to the entire AM band, but the LPFM service provides considerably greater coverage at 100 watts than the 10-watt limit on AM – hence the considerable appeal for government agencies). * Some investors in radio believe LPFM services prevent the development of digital radio. * NPR is a major opponent to low-power FM. Their stance is that allowing more flexible rules for LPFM would burden other stations by forcing them to deal with interference problems and because full-power broadcasters reach a broader audience and provide a greater service, they should be favored regarding spectrum availability. * The National Association of Broadcasters is the other major source of opposition. Its stance is that full-power FM broadcasters “enhance localism” by providing community-responsive information such as emergency information. Allowing low-power FM stations to have equal spectrum rights could be detrimental to these necessary programs. LPFM vs. broadcast translators Unlike the former FM class D license, an LPFM station has no priority over broadcast translators in the allocation of available spectrum. This is problematic insofar as the regulations for broadcast translators exempts non-commercial stations from the requirement that translators be within the coverage area of the original station that they rebroadcast. However, this provision only affects translators in the non- commercial portion of the band. Stations in the commercial part of the spectrum must be fed over the air unless they are within the actual service area of the primary station. Since the translator window of 2003 was only open for commercial channels, the use of directly-fed via satellite FM translators, commonly called \\"Satellators\\", was never a factor in the 2003 window. The FCC licensing window for new translator applications in 2003 resulted in over 13,000 applications being filed, most of them coming from a few religious broadcasters. However even though all translators on commercial frequencies must be fed by a direct, over-the-air source, regardless of who owns the translator per FCC rule 74.1231(b), the actual over-the-air source (the primary station) can be satellite fed, just as commercial stations can be fed by satellite. This leads to programming from a single station (retransmitted by many others) ending up on several hundred different translators. One station cannot apply for hundreds or thousands of translators nationwide, using automated means to generate license applications for all available channels, unless all of their applications are exclusively on the non- commercial part of the broadcast band (88–91.9 MHz). () As with any new service that shares the FM spectrum, when translators are added to an area, they can reduce or eliminate the availability of channels both for new LPFM applicants and for relocation of any existing LPFM stations displaced by full- service broadcasters. Unlike an LPFM station, a translator is not required to (and legally not authorized to) originate any local content except as permitted by . Thus there is competition for spectrum in some locations between the LPFM service and the FM translator service. In May 2018, several groups supporting community-based low-power FM stations filed objections with the FCC, citing the Local Community Radio Act, accusing it of favoring existing station coverage expansion with translator licenses - \\"a spectrum grab\\" - over new LPFM spectrum licenses. =AM radio= The acronym 'LPAM' is not a legal term in the United States and is only used in this article as a (conventional) abbreviation. Unlike LPFM stations, which have legal and regulatory status, FCC rules do not define \\"LPAM\\" nor issue licenses for low- power AM transmission. LPAM is only an acronym applied to licensed low-power AM operations and to Part 15 transmissions as well. Any \\"low power AM\\" in FCC licensing for stations in the United States is the requirement for higher- power licensed AM stations to reduce their transmit power at nighttime or post-sunset / pre-sunrise as part of their FCC broadcast authorization. There is a category Class D for AM broadcast licenses, which limited stations to daytime-only transmission before regulations changed in the 1980s. Many, but not all, Class D stations have been granted authority to broadcast at night with enough power to be heard within a few miles of their transmitters. Other LPAM operations are known as Travelers' Information Stations (TIS), sometimes also called highway advisory radio (HAR). Authorized under FCC Part 90.242, these are stations licensed to local transportation departments or other governmental or quasi-governmental agencies to provide bulletins to motorists regarding traffic conditions. These are often near highways and airports, and occasionally other tourism attractions such as national parks. Some are used by chemical and nuclear facilities for emergency evacuation information systems, others by public safety entities for mobile operations. Music is not allowed on TIS/HAR stations and they are restricted to only 3 kHz wide, \\"low- fidelity audio\\" as well, compared to the 10 kHz audio for standard AM broadcasters and 15 kHz audio permitted on FM stations. (Modern AM stations in the US actually restrict their audio to 5 kHz down to 2.5 kHz - roughly the same as to TIS stations. TIS transmissions are normally authorized for 10 Watts or less, although some higher authorizations exist, primarily in locations where emergency evacuation may become necessary. The 60-watt TIS stations on 1640 and 1680 kHz at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport have the highest licensed power among full-time TIS stations.http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/letterPdf/LetterPdfController?licId=1236825&letterVersionId;=52&autoLetterId;=0&letterCode;=AZ&radioServiceCode;=PW&op;=LetterPdf&licSide;=Y&letterTo;=L%20%20%20%20&archive;=nul =Television= Low Power Television stations in the US by community of license There are more than 2,450 licensed low-power television (LPTV) stations in the U.S., which are located in markets of all sizes, from New York City (five stations, though more exist in the market from other cities of license) down to Junction City, Kansas (two stations). LPTV (-LP) and LPTV Digital (-LD) are common in the U.S., Canada and most of the Americas, where most stations originate their own programming. Stations that do not originate their own programming are designated as translators (-TX). The Community Broadcasters Act of 1998 directed the FCC to create a classification of LPTV licenses called Class A (-CA). Digital low-power and Class-A television stations have an ERP limit of 3,000 watts (3 kW) for VHF, and 15 kilowatts for UHF. The LPTV service is considered a secondary service by the FCC, which means the licensee is not guaranteed protection from interference or displacement. An LPTV station must accept harmful interference from full- service television stations and may not cause harmful interference to any full-service television station (the FCC defines interference levels deemed to be \\"harmful\\"). The problem with potential displacement was made evident during the transition of broadcasting in the United States from analog to digital. All television stations operating on UHF channels 52 and above were required to move to channel 51 or below. Full-service stations were guaranteed a place to land in the new compressed band while LPTV stations operating on channels 52 and above were required to either find their own channel or lose their license. Class A LPTV stations The FCC provided a one-time filing opportunity for existing LPTV stations to become Class A stations. The designation was only available to LPTV stations that were producing two hours per week of local programming. Class A stations had to maintain a production studio within their Grade B contour, and comply with many of the requirements placed on full-service television stations. This allowed them to obtain protected channel status. Must-carry One of the key distinctions between full-service television stations and low-power stations is cable television and direct broadcast satellite (DBS) carriage. Full-service stations are guaranteed carriage in their local television market through \\"must-carry\\" whereas LPTV stations are not. In 2008, there was an effort put forward by FCC chairman Kevin Martin to grant must-carry rights to Class A LPTV stations. The effort failed due to a lack of support from the other FCC Commissioners. Network affiliates Though many low-power television stations are either unaffiliated, or broadcast programming from small networks meant for their use, some LPTV stations are affiliated with major broadcast networks like Fox, The CW or MyNetworkTV. Examples include in Boston, Massachusetts with NBC on WBTS-CD; Youngstown, Ohio, where a pair of LPTV stations based at WYFX-LD broadcast Fox programming, along with the digital subchannel of the co-owned CBS affiliate, WKBN-TV; or in the Lima, Ohio area, whose low-power stations are affiliates of major networks, such as CBS and ABC. Digital transition On July 15, 2011, the FCC issued an order to low-power broadcasters that effectively requires all remaining television transmitters to vacate channels 52 to 69 by December 31, 2011. In that same order, the FCC effectively required all remaining analog transmitters to have shut down by March 29, 2016. Unlike AM and FM, unlicensed use of television bands is prohibited for broadcasting. The amateur television channels do allow for some very limited non-entertainment transmissions however, with some repeaters airing NASA TV during Space Shuttle missions when they are not in local use. The low-power television industry was represented by the Community Broadcasters Association (CBA), which held its annual convention each year in October and an annual meeting each year in April at the National Association of Broadcasters Convention in Las Vegas. The meeting was always held on the Monday night of the NAB convention in Ballroom B of the Las Vegas Hilton and was open to anyone interested in the low-power television industry. On August 13, 2009, the CBA announced in a statement that it would shut down after 20 years of representing LPTV stations. One reason given was the \\"restrictive regulations that kept the Class A and LPTV industry from realizing its potential\\". Another was the inability to reach most viewers, partly due to Multichannel Video Programming Distributors refusing to carry these channels. In addition, Amy Brown, former CBA executive director, said, \\"some 40% of Class A and LPTV station operators believe they will have to shut down in the next year if they are not helped through the digital transition.\\" In February 2006, the FCC released its Notices of Proposed Rules for Digital Radio. The Commission reaffirms its commitment to provide broadcasters with the opportunity to take advantage of digital audio broadcasting (DAB) technology, proposed criteria for evaluating models and systems, such as the In Band On Channel (IBOC) system, and inquired on the needs for a mandatory DAB transmission standard. In section 39 of the Notice, the FCC inquires as how to balance incentives for broadcasters to switch to digital systems with incumbents of new entrance opportunities, stating that they “seek analyses of the minimum power levels that would preserve service within protected service areas in an all-digital environment, and alternatively, the levels that would not result in significant disruptions to current listening patterns.” The DAB system that has been identified as the best fit for LPFM is IBOC system. This is a hybrid system that uses existing frequencies and can operate carrying digital information along with analog broadcast signal on the sidebands. However, the digital carriers require the bandwidth to be widened, which would cause interference to stations on the first adjacent channel. If LPFM adopts IBOC, then LPFM would also need to accept a second adjacent channel restriction between two LPFM stations, as there is a potential that the sidebands of two LPFM stations would overlap causing interference. Currently, imposing a second adjacent channel restriction would impact less than 10 LPFM stations.

ERP measures the combination of the power emitted by the transmitter and the ability of the antenna to direct that power in a given direction. It is equal to the input power to the antenna multiplied by the gain of the antenna. It is used in electronics and telecommunications, particularly in broadcasting to quantify the apparent power of a broadcasting station experienced by listeners in its reception area. An alternate parameter that measures the same thing is effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP). Effective isotropic radiated power is the hypothetical power that would have to be radiated by an isotropic antenna to give the same (\\"equivalent\\") signal strength as the actual source antenna in the direction of the antenna's strongest beam. The difference between EIRP and ERP is that ERP compares the actual antenna to a half-wave dipole antenna, while EIRP compares it to a theoretical isotropic antenna. Since a half-wave dipole antenna has a gain of 1.64 (or 2.15 dB) compared to an isotropic radiator, if ERP and EIRP are expressed in watts their relation is :\\\\mathrm{EIRP(W)} = 1.64 \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{ERP(W)} If they are expressed in decibels :\\\\mathrm{EIRP(dB)} = \\\\mathrm{ERP(dB)} + 2.15  Definitions  Effective radiated power and effective isotropic radiated power both measure the power density a radio transmitter and antenna (or other source of electromagnetic waves) radiates in a specific direction: in the direction of maximum signal strength (the \\"main lobe\\") of its radiation pattern. This apparent power is dependent on two factors: the total power output and the radiation pattern of the antenna – how much of that power is radiated in the desired direction. The latter factor is quantified by the antenna gain, which is the ratio of the signal strength radiated by an antenna in its direction of maximum radiation to that radiated by a standard antenna. For example, a 1,000-watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 4 (6 dBi) will have the same signal strength in the direction of its main lobe, and thus the same ERP and EIRP, as a 4,000-watt transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 1 (0 dBi). So ERP and EIRP are measures of radiated power that can compare different combinations of transmitters and antennas on an equal basis. In spite of the names, ERP and EIRP do not measure transmitter power, or total power radiated by the antenna, they are just a measure of signal strength along the main lobe. They give no information about power radiated in other directions, or total power. ERP and EIRP are always greater than the actual total power radiated by the antenna. The difference between ERP and EIRP is that antenna gain has traditionally been measured in two different units, comparing the antenna to two different standard antennas; an isotropic antenna and a half-wave dipole antenna: *Isotropic gain is the ratio of the power density S_\\\\text{max} (signal strength in watts per square meter) received at a point far from the antenna (in the far field) in the direction of its maximum radiation (main lobe), to the power S_\\\\text{max,isotropic} received at the same point from a hypothetical lossless isotropic antenna, which radiates equal power in all directions ::\\\\mathrm{G}_\\\\text{i} = {S_\\\\text{max} \\\\over S_\\\\text{max,isotropic}} :Gain is often expressed in logarithmic units of decibels (dB). The decibel gain relative to an isotropic antenna (dBi) is given by ::\\\\mathrm{G}\\\\text{(dBi)} = 10\\\\log{S_\\\\text{max} \\\\over S_\\\\text{max,isotropic}} *Dipole gain is the ratio of the power density received from the antenna in the direction of its maximum radiation to the power density S_\\\\text{max,dipole} received from a lossless half-wave dipole antenna in the direction of its maximum radiation ::\\\\mathrm{G}_\\\\text{d} = {S_\\\\text{max} \\\\over S_\\\\text{max,dipole}} :The decibel gain relative to a dipole (dBd) is given by ::\\\\mathrm{G}\\\\text{(dBd)} = 10\\\\log{S_\\\\text{max} \\\\over S_\\\\text{max,dipole}} In contrast to an isotropic antenna, the dipole has a \\"donut-shaped\\" radiation pattern, its radiated power is maximum in directions perpendicular to the antenna, declining to zero on the antenna axis. Since the radiation of the dipole is concentrated in horizontal directions, the gain of a half-wave dipole is greater than that of an isotropic antenna. The isotropic gain of a half-wave dipole is 1.64, or in decibels 10 log 1.64 = 2.15 dBi, so :G_\\\\text{i} = 1.64G_\\\\text{d} In decibels :G\\\\text{(dBi)} = G\\\\text{(dBd)} + 2.15 The two measures EIRP and ERP are based on the two different standard antennas above: *EIRP is defined as the RMS power input in watts required to a lossless isotropic antenna to give the same maximum power density far from the antenna as the actual transmitter. It is equal to the power input to the transmitter's antenna multiplied by the isotropic antenna gain ::\\\\mathrm{EIRP} = G_\\\\text{i} P_\\\\text{in} :The ERP and EIRP are also often expressed in decibels (dB). The input power in decibels is usually calculated with comparison to a reference level of one watt (W): P_\\\\text{in}\\\\mathrm{(dBw)} = 10 \\\\log P_\\\\text{in}. Since multiplication of two factors is equivalent to addition of their decibel values ::\\\\mathrm{EIRP(dBw)} = G\\\\text{(dBi)} + P_\\\\text{in}\\\\mathrm{(dBw)} *ERP is defined as the RMS power input in watts required to a lossless half-wave dipole antenna to give the same maximum power density far from the antenna as the actual transmitter. It is equal to the power input to the transmitter's antenna multiplied by the antenna gain relative to a half-wave dipole ::\\\\mathrm{ERP} = G_\\\\text{d} P_\\\\text{in} :In decibels ::\\\\mathrm{ERP(dBw)} = G\\\\text{(dBd)} + P_\\\\text{in}\\\\mathrm{(dBw)} Since the two definitions of gain only differ by a constant factor, so do ERP and EIRP :\\\\mathrm{EIRP(W)} = 1.64 \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{ERP(W)} In decibels :\\\\mathrm{EIRP(dBw)} =\\\\mathrm{ERP}\\\\text{(dBw)} + 2.15 Relation to transmitter output power The transmitter is usually connected to the antenna through a transmission line. Since the transmission line may have significant losses L, the power applied to the antenna is usually less than the output power of the transmitter P_\\\\text{TX}. The relation of ERP and EIRP to transmitter output power is :\\\\mathrm{EIRP(dBw)} = P_\\\\text{TX}\\\\mathrm{(dBw)} - L\\\\mathrm{(dB)} + G\\\\text{(dBi)} :\\\\mathrm{ERP(dBw)} = P_\\\\text{TX}\\\\mathrm{(dBw)} - L\\\\mathrm{(dB)} + G\\\\text{(dBi)} - 2.15 Losses in the antenna itself are included in the gain. Relation to signal strength If the signal path is in free space (line-of- sight propagation with no multipath) the signal strength (power flux density in watts per square meter) S of the radio signal on the main lobe axis at any particular distance r from the antenna can be calculated from the EIRP or ERP. Since an isotropic antenna radiates equal power flux density over a sphere centered on the antenna, and the area of a sphere with radius r is A = 4\\\\pi r^2 then :S(r) = {\\\\mathrm{EIRP} \\\\over 4\\\\pi r^2} Since \\\\mathrm{EIRP} = \\\\mathrm{ERP} / 1.64, :S(r) = {\\\\mathrm{ERP} \\\\over 6.56\\\\pi r^2} However if the radio waves travel by ground wave as is typical for medium or longwave broadcasting, skywave, or indirect paths play a part in transmission, the waves will suffer additional attenuation which depends on the terrain between the antennas, so these formulas are not valid.  Dipole vs. isotropic radiators  Because ERP is calculated as antenna gain (in a given direction) as compared with the maximum directivity of a half-wave dipole antenna, it creates a mathematically virtual effective dipole antenna oriented in the direction of the receiver. In other words, a notional receiver in a given direction from the transmitter would receive the same power if the source were replaced with an ideal dipole oriented with maximum directivity and matched polarization towards the receiver and with an antenna input power equal to the ERP. The receiver would not be able to determine a difference. Maximum directivity of an ideal half-wave dipole is a constant, i.e., 0 dBd = 2.15 dBi. Therefore, ERP is always 2.15 dB less than EIRP. The ideal dipole antenna could be further replaced by an isotropic radiator (a purely mathematical device which cannot exist in the real world), and the receiver cannot know the difference so long as the input power is increased by 2.15 dB. Unfortunately, the distinction between dBd and dBi is often left unstated and the reader is sometimes forced to infer which was used. For example, a Yagi–Uda antenna is constructed from several dipoles arranged at precise intervals to create better energy focusing (directivity) than a simple dipole. Since it is constructed from dipoles, often its antenna gain is expressed in dBd, but listed only as dB. Obviously this ambiguity is undesirable with respect to engineering specifications. A Yagi–Uda antenna's maximum directivity is 8.77 dBd = 10.92 dBi. Its gain necessarily must be less than this by the factor η, which must be negative in units of dB. Neither ERP nor EIRP can be calculated without knowledge of the power accepted by the antenna, i.e., it is not correct to use units of dBd or dBi with ERP and EIRP. Let us assume a 100-watt (20 dBW) transmitter with losses of 6 dB prior to the antenna. ERP < 22.77dBW and EIRP < 24.92dBW, both less than ideal by η in dB. Assuming that the receiver is in the first side-lobe of the transmitting antenna, and each value is further reduced by 7.2 dB, which is the decrease in directivity from the main to side-lobe of a Yagi-Uda. Therefore, anywhere along the side-lobe direction from this transmitter, a blind receiver could not tell the difference if a Yagi-Uda was replaced with either an ideal dipole (oriented towards the receiver) or an isotropic radiator with antenna input power increased by 1.57 dB.  Polarization  Polarization has not been taken into account so far, but it must be properly clarified. When considering the dipole radiator previously we assumed that it was perfectly aligned with the receiver. Now assume, however, that the receiving antenna is circularly polarized, and there will be a minimum 3 dB polarization loss regardless of antenna orientation. If the receiver is also a dipole, it is possible to align it orthogonally to the transmitter such that theoretically zero energy is received. However, this polarization loss is not accounted for in the calculation of ERP or EIRP. Rather, the receiving system designer must account for this loss as appropriate. For example, a cellular telephone tower has a fixed linear polarization, but the mobile handset must function well at any arbitrary orientation. Therefore, a handset design might provide dual polarization receive on the handset so that captured energy is maximized regardless of orientation, or the designer might use a circularly polarized antenna and account for the extra 3 dB of loss with amplification.  FM example  Four bay crossed-dipole antenna of an FM broadcasting station. For example, an FM radio station which advertises that it has 100,000 watts of power actually has 100,000 watts ERP, and not an actual 100,000-watt transmitter. The transmitter power output (TPO) of such a station typically may be 10,000 to 20,000 watts, with a gain factor of 5 to 10 (5× to 10×, or 7 to 10 dB). In most antenna designs, gain is realized primarily by concentrating power toward the horizontal plane and suppressing it at upward and downward angles, through the use of phased arrays of antenna elements. The distribution of power versus elevation angle is known as the vertical pattern. When an antenna is also directional horizontally, gain and ERP will vary with azimuth (compass direction). Rather than the average power over all directions, it is the apparent power in the direction of the antenna's main lobe that is quoted as a station's ERP (this statement is just another way of stating the definition of ERP). This is particularly applicable to the huge ERPs reported for shortwave broadcasting stations, which use very narrow beam widths to get their signals across continents and oceans. = United States regulatory usage = ERP for FM radio in the United States is always relative to a theoretical reference half-wave dipole antenna. (That is, when calculating ERP, the most direct approach is to work with antenna gain in dBd). To deal with antenna polarization, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) lists ERP in both the horizontal and vertical measurements for FM and TV. Horizontal is the standard for both, but if the vertical ERP is larger it will be used instead. The maximum ERP for US FM broadcasting is usually 100,000 watts (FM Zone II) or 50,000 watts (in the generally more densely populated Zones I and I-A), though exact restrictions vary depending on the class of license and the antenna height above average terrain (HAAT).47 CFR 73.211 Some stations have been grandfathered in or, very infrequently, been given a waiver, and can exceed normal restrictions.  Microwave band issues  For most microwave systems, a completely non-directional isotropic antenna (one which radiates equally and perfectly well in every direction - a physical impossibility) is used as a reference antenna, and then one speaks of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power) rather than ERP. This includes satellite transponders, radar, and other systems which use microwave dishes and reflectors rather than dipole-style antennas.  Lower-frequency issues  In the case of medium wave (AM) stations in the United States, power limits are set to the actual transmitter power output, and ERP is not used in normal calculations. Omnidirectional antennas used by a number of stations radiate the signal equally in all directions. Directional arrays are used to protect co- or adjacent channel stations, usually at night, but some run directionally 24 hours. While antenna efficiency and ground conductivity are taken into account when designing such an array, the FCC database shows the station's transmitter power output, not ERP.  Related terms  According to the Institution of Electrical Engineers (UK), ERP is often used as a general reference term for radiated power, but strictly speaking should only used when the antenna is a half-wave dipole, and is used when referring to FM transmission. =EMRP= Effective monopole radiated power (EMRP) may be used in Europe, particularly in relation to medium wave broadcasting antennas. This is the same as ERP, except that a short vertical antenna (i.e. a short monopole) is used as the reference antenna instead of a half-wave dipole. =CMF= Cymomotive force (CMF) is an alternative term used for expressing radiation intensity in volts, particularly at the lower frequencies. It is used in Australian legislation regulating AM broadcasting services, which describes it as: \\"for a transmitter, [it] means the product, expressed in volts, of: (a) the electric field strength at a given point in space, due to the operation of the transmitter; and (b) the distance of that point from the transmitter’s antenna\\". 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence. It relates to AM broadcasting only, and expresses the field strength in \\"microvolts per metre at a distance of 1 kilometre from the transmitting antenna\\".  HAAT  The height above average terrain for VHF and higher frequencies is extremely important when considering ERP, as the signal coverage (broadcast range) produced by a given ERP dramatically increases with antenna height. Because of this, it is possible for a station of only a few hundred watts ERP to cover more area than a station of a few thousand watts ERP, if its signal travels above obstructions on the ground.

Retrieved 2 February 2011. \\"Kingfisher UK 3 Sheldon Square Paddington London W2 6PX\\" It has over 1,300 stores in nine countries, and its brands include B&Q;, Castorama, Brico Dépôt and Screwfix. Kingfisher is listed on the London Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.  History  The company was founded in 1982 as Paternoster Stores Ltd, to conduct a buyout of the British Woolworths chain. In March 1983, Paternoster changed its name to Woolworth Holdings plc. Woolworths already owned B&Q;, and the company expanded through subsequent acquisitions of companies such as Superdrug and Comet. The business acquired Screwfix in July 1999, which is now the United Kingdom's largest multi channel retailer of trade tools, accessories and hardware products. The company was led from January 1984, until his retirement in December 2002, by Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy. Largely through his influence, the company became the major sponsor of British sailor Ellen MacArthur. Woolworth Holdings was renamed Kingfisher plc in December 1989. Further acquisitions included European companies such as Castorama, BUT S.A. and Wegert. In July 1999, Kingfisher attempted a takeover of Asda, one of the United Kingdom's largest supermarket chains, only to be beaten by Walmart. In August 2001, coupled with an acrimonious battle for control of Castorama, the resultant share price pressure forced the sale and demerger of several parts of the company, including Woolworths (forming the Woolworths Group), and the demerger of the electricals business to form Kesa Electricals in July 2003 – causing the company to refocus entirely around DIY.Kesa Chief's pay will double after split The company was led by Gerry Murphy from December 2002 to November 2007. In January 2008, Kingfisher appointed Ian Cheshire as group chief executive. Cheshire was formerly B&Q;'s chief executive; his B&Q; role was taken over in April 2009, by Euan Sutherland, who also headed up the United Kingdom division of Kingfisher. In September 2014, it was announced that the head of Castorama Véronique Laury would replace Ian Cheshire as Kingfisher group CEO in February 2015. Laury had worked at Kingfisher for eleven years, including roles at B&Q.; In June 2017, Andy Cosslett succeeded Daniel Bernard as chairman. In March 2019, it was announced that Laury would be leaving the business at a date to be announced, following the failure of her \\"One Kingfisher\\" plan, and a 52.8% collapse in pre tax profits. In September 2019, Thierry Garnier was appointed as CEO. Operations Kingfisher currently operates over 1,300 stores in eight countries in Europe and in Turkey.

In Europe and Africa (defined as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) region 1) and in Australia, it spans from 87.5 to 108 megahertz (MHz) - also known as VHF Band II - while in the Americas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108 MHz. The FM broadcast band in Japan uses 76 to 95 MHz. The International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT) band in Eastern Europe is from 65.8 to 74.0 MHz, although these countries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band, as in the case of Russia. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have changed to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band. Frequency modulation radio originated in the United States during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American electrical engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, FM broadcasting did not become widespread, even in North America, until the 1960s. Frequency-modulated radio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this article are in the very high frequency (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to 300 MHz. CCIR bandplan =Center frequencies= While all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 MHz. An ITU conference in Geneva, Switzerland, on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50 kHz channel spacings throughout Europe. * Most countries have used 100 kHz or 200 kHz channel spacings for FM broadcasting since this ITU conference in 1984. * Some digitally-tuned FM radios are unable to tune using 50 kHz or even 100 kHz increments. Therefore, when traveling abroad, stations that broadcast on certain frequencies using such increments may not be heard clearly. This problem will not affect reception on an analog-tuned radio. * A few countries, such as Italy, which have heavily congested FM bands, still allow a station on any multiple of 50 kHz wherever one can be squeezed in. * The 50 kHz channel spacings help prevent co-channel interference, and these take advantage of FM's capture effect and receiver selectivity. =ITU Region 2 bandplan and channel numbering= The original frequency allocation in North America used by Edwin Armstrong used the frequency band from 42 through 50 MHz, but this allocation was changed to a higher band beginning in 1945. In Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Bahamas, etc., there are 101 FM channels numbered from 200 (center frequency 87.9 MHz) to 300 (center frequency 107.9 MHz), though these numbers are rarely used outside the fields of radio engineering and government. The center frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200 kHz. The frequency of 87.9 MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88 MHz), is used by just two FM class-D stations in the United States. Portable radio tuners often tune down to 87.5 MHz, so that the same radios can be made and sold worldwide. Automobiles usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7 MHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75 MHz (±10 kHz) could be received, such as in Birmingham, Alabama, and Denver, Colorado. With the advent of digital television in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant when the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down or convert to digital by September 2015—but there are still analog television stations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also analog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands. In the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of 87.9–91.9 MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the reserved band, exclusively for non-commercial educational (NCE) stations. The other channels (92.1 MHz through 107.9 MHz (Channels 221–300) may be used by both commercial and non-commercial stations.http://www.fcc.gov/topic/fm-radio (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this reservation does not apply.) Originally, the American Federal Communications Commission (FCC) devised a bandplan in which FM radio stations would be assigned at intervals of four channels (800 kHz separation) for any one geographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7, etc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7 etc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see FM broadcasting), which had a limit of three kilowatts of effective radiated power (ERP) and an antenna height limit for the center of radiation of 300 feet (91.4 m) height above average terrain (HAAT). These frequencies were 92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9, 101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other frequencies, a station could be Class B (50 kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100 kW, 2,000 feet), depending on which zone it was in. In the late 1980s, the FCC switched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently operating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and change antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six kilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late 2004, a station can be \\"squeezed in\\" anywhere as long as the location and class conform to the rules in the FCC separation table. The rules for second- adjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964. =Deviation and bandpass= Normally each channel is 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass audio and subcarrier frequencies up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150 kHz total (±75 kHz) in order to prevent adjacent- channel interference on the band. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-stereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by the subcarriers. OIRT bandplan The OIRT FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74 MHz. It was used in the Soviet Union and most of the other Warsaw Pact member countries of the International Radio and Television Organisation in Eastern Europe (OIRT), with the exception of East Germany, which always used the 87.5 to 100 (later 104) MHz broadcast band—in line with Western Europe. The lower portion of the VHF band behaves a bit like shortwave radio in that it has a longer reach than the upper portion of the VHF band. It was ideally suited for reaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception. In a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate interference from skywaves. Transition to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band started as early as the 1980s in some East European countries. Following the collapse of the communist governments, that transition was remarkably accelerated as private stations have been established. This was also prompted by the lack of equipment for the OIRT band and the modernisation of existing transmission networks. Many countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM band, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the USSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the lack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia. Countries which still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus, Moldova,http://www.egocities.com Ukraine, Lithuania and Turkmenistan. In Czechoslovakia, the decision to use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band instead of 65.9 to 74 MHz band was made in the beginning of the eighties. The frequency plan was created, which was internationally coordinated at Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in the VHF band in Geneva, 1984.Regional Administrative Conference for FM Sound Broadcasting in the VHF band (Region 1 and certain countries concerned in Region 3) (2nd session) (Geneva, 1984), Accessed 2019-03-05 Allocated frequencies are still valid and are used in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The first transmitter was put into operation on 102.5 MHz near Prague in November 1984. Three years later, there were eleven transmitters in service across the country, including three in the Prague neighborhood of Žižkov. In 1988, the plan was to set up 270 transmitters in 45 locations eventually.(Czechoslovak DX Club, in Czech) Accessed 2019-03-05 The transition was finished in 1993. Hungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in 2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur radio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform propagation and interference experiments in the 70–70.5 MHz band. In Belarus, only government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All stations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main purpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment. In 2014, Russia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the \\"western\\") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to reach more listeners. Unlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based on 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to reduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other atmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However, multipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band. Stereo is generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process called polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25 kHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal structure: L + R --> 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R. The 4-meter band (70–70.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is entirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band (50–54 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there is an \\"opening\\" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing because the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single broadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the band. The System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within the 87.5–108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D therefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to make full use of this band for audio broadcasting. Japanese bandplan The FM band in Japan is 76–95 MHz (previously 76–90). The 90–108 MHz section was used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each NTSC television channel is 6 MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to slightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations that can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial radio stations are forced to use AM. Many Japanese radios are capable of receiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same model can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz, the frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the radio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode or other internal component. Conventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios were formerly marked with \\"TV Sound\\" in the 76–88 section. If these radios were sold in the US, for example, the 76–88 section would be marked TV sound for VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6 MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88–108 section band as normal FM. The compatibility of \\"TV sound\\" with conventional FM radio ended with the U.S. digital TV transition in 2009, with the exception of the limited number of low-power stations on channel 6 that still use analog; these low-power stations will switch to digital in 2021. Second-hand automobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM band, and importers often fit a \\"converter\\" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9 MHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing an incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in undesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular international FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz-wide Japanese band (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert modes), and the car's antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some converters simply down-convert the FM band by 12 MHz, leading to logical frequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the 102–108 MHz band. Also, RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car radios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow pass-through of the MW band, which is used for AM broadcasting. A better solution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the country where the car will be used. Australia had a similar situation with Australian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108 MHz, and was intending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due to CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in Australia for 76 to 90 MHz.This was taught at the TAFE college Audio course of the electronic servicing certificate, and it is also part of the long story of the introduction of FM radio in Australia, which can be found in older Australian electronics magazines. Historic U.S. bandplan Early FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42–50 MHz bandRegarding the 42—50 MHz FM band and the switchover Accessed 2010-08-28 (this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations known as apex broadcasters). In 1941, the Yankee Network, which was already using FM for AM station feeds, started operating a station, W39B, in this band from a transmitter atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest point in the northeast United States.http://www.mountwashington.org/about/visitor/history/, retrieved 10-08-2014. (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United States FCC decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88–106 MHz band (later extended to 108 MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although converters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to rebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set FM radio back ten years. The \\"devastating\\" change was successfully lobbied for (with the FCC) by RCA, which did not want FM radio to become dominant, although the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted \\"an organized campaign of misinformation\\". This protected RCA's and other networks' investments in AM radio, and avoided competition with television, which RCA wanted to focus on.Edwin Howard Armstrong#FM radio, FM broadcasting in the United States, Yankee Network. In March 2008, the FCC requested public comment on turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5 and 6 (76–88 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital television transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed to June 2009). , 28403 This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies corresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76 MHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.Could EXB Band Be Your New Home? RadioWorld September 10, 2008 FM radio switch-off With the invention of DAB+ radio, some countries have planned and started an FM radio switch-off. Norway, in January 2018, was the first country to discontinue FM as a result.

Its route is a rough semicircle. Although much of it originated as part of the North London Railway, the current route is the result of a series of amalgamations, closures and reopenings, and has a mix of third-rail and overhead electrical power supply. It remains heavily used by freight services in addition to the main London Overground (LO) service. Between Richmond and Gunnersbury, London Underground's District line shares tracks with London Overground services; the entire route is owned and maintained by Network Rail. TfL took over the line in 2007 and introduced new stock as well as putting the line on the Tube map. It closed for four months in 2010 between and and had a reduced service for another year to allow platform extensions and signalling upgrades. History =Formation= The North London line between Richmond and North Woolwich derived from five connecting sections which were opened over 25 years from 1846: * The easternmost section opened as the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway in 1846/7 between Stratford and North Woolwich. The later construction of the Royal Victoria Dock necessitated a swing-bridge on the original route south of Canning Town which was rerouted in 1850 via Custom House and the Connaught Tunnel. The original route was retained as the Silvertown Tramway, a local freight line connected at both ends to the new main line. * The main central section opened from 1850 to 1852 as the East & West India Docks & Birmingham Junction Railway (renamed the North London Railway (NLR) in 1853). This gave a link from the Euston main line near Primrose Hill to the docks at Poplar via Bow. * In the west, the North & South Western Junction Railway was opened in 1853 from to a junction with the Hounslow Loop Line near . * The last link in the east was opened between the NLR near Victoria Park and Stratford in 1854. * To obviate NLR trains running on the busy Euston main line, the Hampstead Junction Railway was opened from the NLR at to Willesden via in 1860. * To give the NLR direct access to the City of London, the City extension to Broad Street was opened from in 1865. * The final part of the route was the opening of a link from to Richmond by the London & South Western Railway (LSWR) in 1869. =Developments= The line from Broad Street to Kew Bridge and Richmond was electrified by the LNWR in 1916 on the fourth-rail DC system. In 1944, passenger services on the NLR Poplar branch ceased. Freight traffic continued on the branch to the docks on the Isle of Dogs until 1980. The trackbed of the southern part of the branch, from Poplar to Bow, was used for the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) branch to Stratford. The service was listed for closure in the 1963 Beeching Report, with losses claimed as being £69,000 per year (). It was saved after a huge campaign. The line was Grant Aided under the Transport Act 1968 and came under threat when the Conservative Government of 1970–71 proposed to reduce Grant Aid funding. That threat, eventually lifted, led to the founding of a new campaign group, the North London Line Committee, which tried to work with British Rail management to promote the service. In 1979, the North Woolwich to Stratford service was extended to Camden Road as the CrossTown LinkLine service, using the same Cravens-built diesel multiple unit trains. There were no intermediate stations until, in 1980, Hackney Wick was opened, near the site of the former Victoria Park station and Hackney Central was re-opened; then Homerton re-opened in 1985 (the two latter stations had closed in 1944). New platforms were built at West Ham for interchange with the adjacent Underground station. =Rolling stock= Class 313 and its replacement, a Class 378 Capitalstar at Richmond The line was originally operated by steam- hauled trains which were replaced after electrification by London and North Western Railway EMUs built from 1914 and augmented by later EMUs built in the 1930s by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. These had all been replaced by the early 1960s with dedicated short-wheelbase trains (shared with the Watford DC line) built by the Southern Region at Eastleigh (using underframes built at Ashford) from 1957 which were later designated by British Railways as Class 501. These were succeeded by Southern Region Class 416 EMU for a short period, these units being allocated to Selhurst depot in south London. Class 416 trains were in turn succeeded by Class 313 EMUs, which worked the route until 2010 when London Overground introduced Class 378 Capitalstar four-car dual-voltage electric trains compatible with both 750 V DC third-rail and 25 kV AC overhead power sources,Transport for London - £36m contract to bring extra rail carriages for London Overground and all of these units were by 2017 operating in 5-car formations to address the additional demand on the route. =Closures= In the 1980s, Broad Street station closed and the Tottenham Hale–Stratford link and the station at Lea Bridge ceased to be used by regular passenger trains. The line between Dalston and North Woolwich was electrified on the third-rail system and Broad Street services were diverted to North Woolwich using former Southern Region 2-EPB types built in the 1950s. The two- car trains soon proved too small and were replaced by three-car Class 313 electric multiple units. The new service was branded by British Rail as the North London Link, and some signs using this name still exist. In December 2006, as with the Poplar branch (see above), the line between Stratford and North Woolwich was permanently closed to make a way for a future DLR extension from to Stratford International (opened February 2011). The section south of Canning Town was not used by the DLR, as it is largely duplicated by the DLR King George V branch. Instead, the section will become part of Crossrail's branch to (opening 2021). The section south of Stratford had always been the 'Cinderella' end of the line, in that when there were operating problems it was common for trains to be turned short at Stratford. =Poor performance before the TfL takeover= Despite favourable performance figures, Association of Train Operating Companies Press Releases the North London line used to be regarded by frequent travellers as offering a poor and unreliable service with extremely congested trains which were often cancelled shortly before they were due to arrive. A 2006 London Assembly report described the current service as \\"shabby, unreliable, unsafe and overcrowded\\", proposing the transfer of the service to Transport for London (TfL) as a solution to improve the quality of the serviceLondon Assembly - Light at end of the tunnel for London's forgotten railway due to upgrade plansAlways Touch Out - London Overground & Orbirail which coincided with the extension of the East London line. A report on the line can be found on the London Assembly website.London's forgotten railway (PDF) =TfL= The North London line, as part of Silverlink, along with the West London line, Gospel Oak to Barking Line and the Watford DC Line, was transferred to Transport for London (TfL) in 2007 to form its new London Overground service. TfL began to remodel stations, integrate lines and following the transfer and extension of the East London line, aims to create an orbital rail service. TfL also brought in new trains and the line, which previously appeared on tube maps following a public campaign, gained its own colour. TfL closed the line in February 2010 between and for the installation of a new signalling system and the rebuilding or extension of platforms to allow four-car trains to run on the line; most NLL platforms had been reduced in usable length (where they had not been originally short) in the late 1960s when services were reduced to three-carriage trains only. The line reopened on 1 June 2010 with a reduced service and none on Sundays, and with the upgrade work completed, the full seven-day service resumed on 22 May 2011. =Former services= In addition to the primary - Richmond service, there were services that linked Broad Street with and on the Watford DC line. Most of these were routed via the line between and Camden Road, calling at although some travelled via and joined the DC line at . Prior to electrification in the 1960s, other services ran as far as Tring on the West Coast Main Line via Primrose Hill and Willesden Junction Main Line (now demolished). By the time that Broad Street closed in 1986, the Watford services operated only in the rush hours; they were diverted to Liverpool Street by way of a new link in Hackney, known as the Graham Road Curve. Trains were frequently cancelled owing to rolling stock shortages; these circumstances had begun some years earlier with service reductions and scrapping of trains in the late 1960s, followed in later years by closure of depots at Croxley Green and Stonebridge Park preventing stabling of spare stock. Along with what eventually became a lack of trains timetabled to serve Liverpool Street to match the needs of rush-hour passengers, this inevitably led to falling patronage. British Rail applied to close the service in 1990, and the last trains ran two years later. In 2000, Anglia Railways started a service between and , utilising parts of the North London line. The service was called London Crosslink and ran up to five times a day at roughly two-hourly intervals. The service called only at principal stations such as , and . On the North London line, the trains called only at , , Camden Road (some services), and Willesden Junction. The service was withdrawn in 2002. The AC electrification of the eastern part of the North London line uses the previously unelectrified northern pair of tracks, which were also partially singled at the same time. Between and Highbury & Islington, there is a line which links to the East Coast Main Line at . This used to carry passenger trains to and from various main line stations (such as Edgware, Alexandra Palace, , and others) over part of the North London line to Broad Street Station; however, with the electrification of the Great Northern Electrics suburban lines in 1976, trains were diverted into and London King's Cross stations, so since then this link has only been used for freight trains. It too was singled concurrent with the AC electrification of the eastern part of the North London line. Route =Track= Most of the line runs in a curve across north London. Only and stations at the western end are south of the River Thames. The river crossing is made by Kew Railway Bridge on tracks which are shared with the London Underground District line. The location of the eastern extremity has varied over the years. Between 1944 and 1986, it was at Broad Street station; then it was switched to . Later, it was cut back to . A tunnel, the Hampstead Heath tunnel, runs under Hampstead between and . The line is double track throughout, with a mix of triple and quadruple track between Camden Road and . The former North Woolwich branch included a section of single track between Custom House and North Woolwich stations, and the Broad Street branch was at one time formed of quadruple track. During the February–May 2010 blockade, the , and stations were rebuilt to allow the extended East London line to serve Highbury & Islington on fully segregated tracks on the south side of the cutting. Under the reinstated four-track arrangement, the North London line moved to the north side of the cutting between Dalston Kingsland and Highbury & Islington, before switching to the inner pair of tracks towards the former Maiden Lane station, leaving the outer pair for freight use only. =Traction current supply= Originally, the line was electrified in 1914–15 using the fourth rail +420 V / -210 V system, as used by London Underground. This was changed in the 1970s to +630 V / 0 V; the trains (then EMUs of a design unique to this and the DC line) were modified to the same basic traction supply arrangements as SR 3rd rail EMUs; the centre/negative current rail was removed except where coincident four-rail running was required between Richmond and Gunnersbury for the Underground trains that share this section, the centre rail there being bonded to the running rail used for current return. The line is now electrified using that same third rail system from Richmond to , but with overhead lines now used from Acton Central to Stratford. The line into Broad Street used third-rail supply and, when the through service to North Woolwich started in 1985, trains used the third rail throughout. When the trains were replaced a few years later by dual-voltage Class 313 trains, it became possible to use the overhead line equipment which had been added to parts of the line for the benefit of freight trains; there had been some unexpected difficulties with earth currents from the third rail system which this overcame. This use was steadily extended, and trains had to make a number of changes between traction current supplies during their short journey; these were at Hackney Wick, Dalston Kingsland, Camden Road and Acton Central. With the final upgrade of the line between Camden Road and Stratford, the need to change traction current systems on this stretch was eliminated, and now the only changeover takes place at Acton Central for the short section to Richmond. The line ran on third rail throughout the 1980s until 1996 when it was closed for conversion to overhead lines. In 2010, the last of the third-rail sections around Camden Road station were completely removed. Connections The line crosses, or comes into contact with, a very large number of other railway lines, especially lines radiating from central London. This does provide opportunities to move between different sectors of suburban London without having to enter the central zone. =Interchanges shown on the tube map= * at , to and from South Western Railway services including the Kingston loop line. * at , connecting NLL services north of the station to District line services east of the station. * at , with the Bakerloo line, Watford DC Line and West London line. * at , with the Jubilee line and Thameslink stations, each situated a short walk either side of the NLL station. * at , to and from the Gospel Oak to Barking Line of London Overground. * at , to and from the Victoria line, the East London line and Great Northern services to Moorgate, Finsbury Park and the Great Northern Line. * at , with the East London line. * at which is linked via direct passenger walkway to Hackney Downs station for London Overground and Greater Anglia services to and from Liverpool Street. * at , to and from the Central line, Great Eastern Main line Greater Anglia services between East Anglia and , the Jubilee line, and Docklands Light Railway. =Other interchanges= * at , 220 m south of on the Jubilee line * at , about 400 m north of on the Metropolitan and Jubilee lines * at , about 400 m north-east of on the Northern line * at , 670 m north of on the Piccadilly line * at , 1 km south- east of on the Piccadilly and District lines.

This service is now provided by King George V DLR station which offers direct rail services to Woolwich Arsenal from North Woolwich, providing quick interchange to services on the North Kent line. Current operations =Service levels= Trains run seven days a week, from approximately 06:00 (09:00 Sundays) until 23:30. During peak times, there are four trains per hour between Richmond and Stratford. Four trains per hour also operate between Clapham Junction and Stratford on the West London line service, making up a total of eight trains per hour between Willesden Junction and Stratford. During off-peak times, there are four trains per hour between Richmond and Stratford, and four trains per hour on the West London line between Clapham Junction and Willesden Junction, with two of these per hour continuing to Stratford, making up a total of six trains per hour between Willesden Junction and Stratford. The introduction of the new four-car, air- conditioned trains, combined with improved signalling and passenger information, has dramatically overhauled the service, making it an effective alternative to travelling through central London for many orbital journeys. =East London line extension= From March 2011, the extended East London line connects to the NLL, with ELL services joining the line west of , running to .Transport for London - East London Railway projectDalston Junction to Highbury & Islington now Connected =Five-car operation= Transport for London extended platforms at some stations along the route to prepare the line for five-car operations in 2015, a project aimed at combating overcrowding on the line. The project was successfully completed and the first five-car trains started to run in summer 2015. Map of the London Overground network, with the NLL connected to other lines Proposed developments =Maiden Lane= Maiden Lane station may be reopened by Camden Council;King's Cross Development plan (PDF) however, the Office of Rail Regulation has not included this in the current plans. =Crossrail to Hounslow= Hounslow council has proposed that part of the North London line be used as a branch of Crossrail to , which would see Crossrail services serving and . It was not included in the initial Crossrail bill but could form part of a later extension. =Old Oak Common Lane= Under the former government's plans for High Speed 2 line from London Euston to Birmingham, a new station called was to be built by 2025 serving the North London line, West London line, High Speed 2 and Crossrail. The new government supports the idea after it had been opposed at first.No business case' to divert HS2 via Heathrow, say Mawhinney Page 6-7, Rail Magazine, Issue 649, 28 July to 10 August 2010 =North Acton= Another new station at is proposed for interchange with the Central line, but it might require the Central line station being moved to the east. =High Speed 2= The planned link between the proposed High Speed 2 line and the existing High Speed 1 line would have used the North London line alignment around Camden Road station, which might have reduced the existing or future capacity of the line. Its heavy investment in the line and the passenger growth on it has made Transport for London against the alignment's use as a link between the two High Speed lines.Transport Select Committee, 28 June 2011, House of Commons That link has now been removed from the parliamentary bill. Closed stations Silverlink Metro 313117 at North Woolwich on 9 December 2006, the final day of service at that station Closed stations apart from those on the closed sections of the line are:  * =City Extension= On 1 November 1865 the NLR opened its City Extension, mostly on a viaduct from a triangular junction at Dalston to Broad Street in the City, with these stations:  * The extension closed on 30 June 1986, but although the track was lifted the viaduct remained in place. The route was re-opened in 2010 as part of the extended East London line, which, like the North London line, is operated by London Overground. =North Woolwich section= On 10 December 2006, the former Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway line between Stratford and North Woolwich was closed to allow building of a Docklands Light Railway line to Stratford International between and . Part of the south end of the closed section is to be used for Crossrail.Transport for London - Stratford International Extension NLL stations closed were:  * * DLR and Jubilee line services are not affected at the first three of those stations.

Tenosynovitis can be either infectious or noninfectious. Common clinical manifestations of noninfectious tenosynovitis include de Quervain tendinopathy and stenosing tenosynovitis (more commonly known as trigger finger) Signs and symptoms Infectious tenosynovitis occurs between 2.5% and 9.4% of all hand infections. Kanavel's cardinal signs is used to diagnose infectious tenosynovitis. They are: tenderness to touch along the flexor aspect of the finger, fusiform enlargement of the affected finger, the finger being held in slight flexion at rest, and severe pain with passive extension. Fever may also be present but is uncommon. Pathogenesis Infectious tenosynovitis is the infection of closed synovial sheaths in the flexor tendons of the fingers. It is usually caused by trauma, but bacteria can spread from other sites of the body. Although tenosynovitis usually affects the flexor tendon of the fingers, the disease can also affect the extensor tendons occasionally. The clinical presentation is therefore as acute infection following trauma. The infection can be mono- or polymicrobial and can vary depending on the nature of the trauma. The most common pathogenic agent is Staphylococcus aureus introduced from the skin. Other bacteria linked to infectious tenosynovitis include Pasteurella multocida (associated with animal bites), Eikenella spp. (associated with IV drug use), and Mycobacterium marinum (associated with wounds exposed to fresh or salt water). Additionally, sexually active patients are at risk for hematogenous spread due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae (see infectious arthritis). Common noninfectious tenosynovitis are: stenosing tenosynovitis, intersection syndrome, extensor pollicis longus (EPL) tenosynovitis, de Quervain's and fourth compartment tenosynovitis. Diagnosis Diagnosis of tenosynovitis is typically made clinically after a thorough patient history and physical exam. Aspirated fluid can also be cultured to identify the infectious organism. X-rays are typically unremarkable but can help rule out a broken bone or a foreign body Treatment The mainstay of treatment for infectious tenosynovitis includes symptom relief, antibiotic therapy, and surgery. Early recognition of the disease with early initiation of antibiotics are important for better range of movement of the affected finger. Minimally invasive procedures into the flexor tendon sheath such as catheter irrigation give better outcomes (74% chance of good outcome) when compared to open surgery (26% chance of good outcome). However, wound irrigation with antibiotics has no clear benefits. Most infectious tenosynovitis cases should be managed with tendon sheath irrigation and drainage, with or without debridement of surrounding necrotic tissue, along with treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. In severe cases, amputation may even be necessary to prevent the further spread of infection. Following surgical intervention, antibiotic therapy is continued and adjusted based on the results of the fluid culture. Prognosis The earlier the condition is identified, the better the chance of getting full range of motion of the finger. However, finger stiffness, Boutonniere deformity, deep space infection, tendon necrosis, adhesions, persistent infection, and need for amputation of the finger can occur. Tendon adhesion and finger stiffness are caused by the violation of the flexor tendon sheath.

Pain may occur in the palm of the hand or knuckles. The name is due to the popping sound made by the affected finger when moved. Most commonly the ring finger or thumb is affected. Risk factors include repeated injury, diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid disease, and inflammatory disease. The underlying mechanism involves the tendon sheath being too narrow for the flexor tendon. This typically occurs at the level of the A1 pulley. While often referred to as a type of stenosing tenosynovitis, little inflammation appears to be present. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms after excluding other possible causes. Initial treatment is generally with rest, splinting the finger, NSAIDs, or steroid injections. If this is not effective surgery may be used. Trigger finger is relatively common. Females are affected more often than males. Those in their 50s and 60s are most commonly affected. The condition was formally described in 1850. Signs and symptoms Symptoms include catching or locking of the involved finger. As the disease progresses pain may occur in the palm of the hand or knuckles. In the ring and middle fingers, often a nodule can be felt at the area of the hand where the palm meets the finger. Causes The cause of trigger finger is unclear but several causes have been proposed. It has also been called stenosing tenosynovitis (specifically digital tenosynovitis stenosans), but this may be a misnomer, as inflammation is not a predominant feature. It has been speculated that repetitive forceful use of a digit leads to narrowing of the fibrous digital sheath in which it runs, but there is little scientific data to support this theory. The relationship of trigger finger to work activities is debatable and scientific evidence for and against hand use as a cause exist. While the mechanism is unclear, there is some evidence that triggering of the thumb is more likely to occur following surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome. It may also occur in rheumatoid arthritis. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made almost exclusively by history and physical examination alone. More than one finger may be affected at a time, though it usually affects the index, thumb, middle, or ring finger. The triggering is usually more pronounced late at night and into the morning, or while gripping an object firmly. Treatment Post operative photo of trigger finger release surgery in a diabetic patient. See: Splinting, non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroid injections are regarded as conservative first-line treatments for stenosing tenosynovitis. However, NSAIDs have been found to be ineffective by themselves. Early treatment of trigger thumb has been associated with better treatment outcomes. Surgical treatment of trigger thumb can be complicated by injury to the digital nerves, scarring, tenderness, or a contracture of the joint. A higher rate of symptom improvement has been observed when surgical management is paired with corticosteroid injections when compared to corticosteroid injections alone. Treatment consists of injection of a corticosteroid such as methylprednisolone often combined with a local anesthetic (lidocaine) at the site of maximal inflammation or tenderness around the A1 pulley of the finger in the palm. The infiltration of the affected site can be performed using standard anatomic landmarks or sonographically guided, and often needs to be repeated 2 or three times to achieve remission. An irreducibly locked trigger, often associated with a flexion contracture of the PIP joint, should not be treated by injections. Injection of the tendon sheath with a corticosteroid is effective over weeks to months in more than half of people. When corticosteroid injection fails, the problem is predictably resolved by a relatively simple surgical procedure (usually outpatient, under local anesthesia). The surgeon will cut the sheath that is restricting the tendon. One study suggests that the most cost-effective treatment is two trials of corticosteroid injection, followed by open release of the first annular pulley. Choosing surgery immediately is the most expensive option and is often not necessary for resolution of symptoms. A 2009 Cochrane review of corticosteroid injection for trigger finger found only two pseudo-randomized controlled trials for a total pooled success rate of only 37%. =Surgery= Procedure of thread trigger finger release For symptoms that have persisted or recurred for more than 6 months and/or have been unresponsive to conservative treatment, surgical release of the pulley may be indicated. The main surgical approaches are percutaneous release and open release. The percutaneous approach, is preferred in some centers due to its reported shorter time of recuperation of motor function, less complications, and less painful. Complication of the surgical management include, persistent trigger finger, bowstringing, digital nerve injury, and continued triggering. Surgery instead of steroid injections may result in a lower recurrence rates, however the quality of the evidence is poor. Thread trigger finger release is an ultrasound guided minimally invasive procedure using a piece of dissecting thread to transect A1 pulley without incision. There is a theoretical greater risk of nerve damage associated with the percutaneous needle release as the technique is performed without seeing the A1 pulley. Prognosis The natural history of disease for trigger finger remains uncertain. There is some evidence that idiopathic trigger finger behaves differently in people with diabetes. Recurrent triggering is unusual after successful injection and rare after successful surgery. While difficulty extending the proximal interphalangeal joint may persist for months, it benefits from exercises to stretch the finger straighter.

It is a small short-billed cormorant usually black above and white below with a yellow bill and small crest, although a mostly black white- throated form predominates in New Zealand. Three subspecies are recognised. Until recently most authorities referred to this species as Phalacrocorax melanoleucos. Taxonomy The species is known as the little pied cormorant in Australia, and as the little shag or by the Māori name of kawaupaka in New Zealand. The term white-throated shag is also reserved for the melanistic form there. The little pied cormorant was originally described by French naturalist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1817. In 1931, American ornithologist James Lee Peters was the first to consider this in a separate genus along with the pygmy cormorant (M. pygmaeus), little cormorant (M. niger), and the long-tailed cormorant (M. africanus). Since then, molecular work by Sibley and Ahlquist showed the little pied and long-tailed cormorants formed a group which had diverged early on from other cormorants. This group of \\"micro-cormorants\\" assumed the genus name Microcarbo, initially described by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855. The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek mikros \\"small\\", and Latin carbo \\"black\\". However, most older authorities refer to this species as Phalacrocorax melanoleucus. In the now-extinct Waray language spoken along the Adelaide River in North Arnhem Land, the species was known as mawa. Three subspecies are commonly recognised: *M. m. melanoleucos. Resident throughout the species range except in New Zealand and the sub- Antarctic islands *M. m. brevicauda Mayr 1931. Endemic to Rennell Island, in the Solomon Islands *M. m. brevirostris Gould 1837 (little shag). Resident throughout New Zealand and regularly seen on sub-Antarctic islands; has bred on Campbell Island. Some authorities treat this form as a distinct species, P. brevirostris. Description The little pied cormorant is a small cormorant measuring with a shorter bill and longer tail than the little black cormorant; it has a small black crest. It is found in two morphs in New Zealand. Subspecies melanoleucos and brevicauda are found only in a pied morph, black (with a slight green tinge) above and white beneath. This is also found in subspecies brevirostris, but in this form the melanistic morph is much more common. In this form the entire plumage is black with a greenish tinge except for the sides of the head, chin, throat and upper neck; the bill is yellow with black on top. Intermediate forms are also found. The pied form is glossy black above with white face, underparts and thighs. The bill and bare skin around the face are yellow. In both forms the legs and feet are black. The pied form is rare in New Zealand, and is most common there in Northland, where it makes up one in every four birds or so. Chicks have dark brown down, with pied morph having patches of paler down. Immature birds are a dull blackish brown, with pied morph birds having paler underparts. The little pied cormorant makes a low cooing during courtship. Wing drying pose Distribution and habitat The species ranges across New Zealand, from Stewart Island to Northland, and across mainland Australia (although not in the arid interior of the west of the country) and Tasmania and Indonesia. Widespread and common, it lives near bodies of water such as swamps, lakes, lagoons, estuaries and the coastline. Feeding The little pied cormorant is a benthic feeder, i.e. it finds its prey on the sea floor. It is a solitary feeder, normally diving in relatively shallow water, often near the shore. Dive times are short, around 15 to 20 seconds, with recovery times on the surface of 5 to 10 seconds unless prey are being swallowed. It takes a variety of fish prey but an unusually high proportion (nearly 30% by weight on average, and up to 80% in some individuals) of crustaceans. In New Zealand waters it is most often seen preying on the local flounder and other small flatfish. Eels and insect larvae are also consumed. These are brought to the surface to be swallowed: the bird will sometimes put a fish down on the surface of the water in order to re- orient it and swallow it head first. Because of this habit, they suffer some kleptoparasitism from red-billed gulls. Breeding Breeding occurs once a year in spring or early summer in southern areas of its range (southern Australia and New Zealand), and after the monsoon in tropical regions. The nest is a platform built of branches and sticks, often still green with leaves in the forks of trees, usually eucalypts that are standing in water. Nests are often located near other waterbirds such as other cormorants, herons, ibises or spoonbills. Four or five pale blue oval eggs measuring 46 x 31 mm are laid. The eggs are covered with a thin layer of lime, giving them a matte white coated appearance. They become increasingly stained with faeces, as does the nest, over the duration of the breeding season.

Opened in 1963, the Hall of Fame enshrines exceptional figures in the sport of professional football, including players, coaches, franchise owners, and front-office personnel, almost all of whom made their primary contributions to the game in the National Football League (NFL); the Hall inducts between four and eight new enshrinees each year. , there are a total of 346 members of the Hall of Fame, 189 of whom are living. Members are referred to as \\"Gold Jackets\\" due to the distinctive gold jackets they receive during the induction ceremony. Between four and eight new inductees are normally enshrined every year. There was no event in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. For 2021, an additional 15 members, known as the \\"Centennial Slate\\", were inducted into the Hall of Fame to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the NFL. History Old entrance to The Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio The city of Canton, Ohio successfully lobbied the NFL to have the Hall of Fame built and has cited three reasons. First, the NFL was founded in Canton on September 17, 1920 (at that time it was known as the American Professional Football Association). Second, the now-defunct Canton Bulldogs were a successful pro football team and the NFL's first two-time NFL champion (in 1922 and 1923). Third, the Canton community held a fundraising effort that garnered nearly $400,000 () to get the Hall of Fame built. Groundbreaking for the building was held on August 11, 1962. The original building contained just two rooms, and of interior space. In April 1970, ground was broken for the first of many expansions. This first expansion cost $620,000, and was completed in May 1971. The size was increased to by adding another room. The pro shop opened with this expansion. This was also an important milestone for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as yearly attendance passed the 200,000 mark for the first time. This was at least in some part due to the increase in popularity of professional football caused by the advent of the American Football League and its success in the final two AFL-NFL World Championship games. Inside the original structure in 2008 In November 1977, work began on another expansion project, costing US$1,200,000. It was completed in November 1978, enlarging the gift shop and research library, while doubling the size of the theater. The total size of the hall was now , more than 2.5 times the original size. The building remained largely unchanged until July 1993. The Hall then announced yet another expansion, costing US$9,200,000, and adding a fifth room. This expansion was completed in October 1995. The building's size was increased to . The most notable addition was the GameDay Stadium, which shows an NFL Films production on a by Cinemascope screen. In 2013, the Hall of Fame completed its largest expansion and renovation to date. Currently, the Hall of Fame consists of 118,000 square feet. Johnson Controls Hall of Fame Village, an estimated $900 million expansion project adjacent to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, has completed Phase I of construction; preparations for beginning Phase II are currently underway. =Executive Directors/Presidents of Hall of Fame= *Dick McCann (April 4, 1962 – November 1967) *Dick Gallagher (April 1968 – December 31, 1975) *Pete Elliott (February 1979 – October 31, 1996) *John Bankert (November 1, 1996 – December 31, 2005) *Steve Perry (April 24, 2006 – January 2014) *David Baker (January 6, 2014 – present) Inductees The Hall is made up of several sections, with display of inductees at its heart Through 2020, all players in the hall except one, Buffalo Bills guard Billy Shaw, played at least some part of their professional career in the NFL, whereas Shaw played his entire career in the American Football League (AFL) prior to the 1970 AFL–NFL merger. Though several Hall of Famers have had AFL, Canadian Football League, World Football League, United States Football League, Arena Football League and/or Indoor Football League experience, and there is a division of the Hall devoted to alternative leagues such as these, to this point no players have made the Hall without having made significant contributions to either the NFL, AFL or All-America Football Conference. For CFL stars, there is a corresponding Canadian Football Hall of Fame; only one player, Warren Moon, and one coach, Bud Grant, are enshrined in both halls. Again for the Arena Football League, there is also a corresponding Arena Football Hall of Fame; similarly, one player, Kurt Warner, has been enshrined into both halls. The Indoor Football League has also established a Hall of Fame, of which Terrell Owens played one season.{cite web url=http://goifl.com/information/hall_of_fame title=Hall of Fame publisher=goifl.com accessdate=February 18, 2020}} The Chicago Bears have the most Hall of Famers among the league's franchises with either 37 or 30 enshrinees depending on whether players that only played a small portion of their careers with the team are counted. =Selection process= Selection Committee Enshrinees are selected by a 48-person committee, largely made up of media members, officially known as the Selection Committee. Each city that has a current NFL team sends one representative from the local media to the committee. A city with more than one franchise sends a representative for each franchise. There are also 15 at-large delegates, including one representative from the Pro Football Writers Association. Except for the PFWA representative, who is appointed to a two-year term, all other appointments are open-ended and terminated only by death, incapacitation, retirement, or resignation. Voting procedure Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium with the Hall of Fame in lower right To be eligible for the nominating process, a player or coach must have been retired for at least five years. Any other contributor such as a team owner or executive can be voted in at any time. Fans may nominate any player, coach or contributor by simply writing via letter or email to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Selection Committee is then polled three times by mail (once in March, once in September, and once in October) to eventually narrow the list to 25 semifinalists. In November, the committee then selects 15 finalists by mail balloting. A Seniors and Contributors Committee, subcommittees of the overall Selection Committee, nominate Seniors (those players who completed their careers more than 25 years ago) and Contributors (individuals who made contributions to the game in areas other than playing or coaching). The Seniors Committee and Contributors Committee add two or one finalist(s) on alternating years which makes a final ballot of 18 finalists under consideration by the full committee each year. Committee members are instructed to only consider a candidate's professional football contributions and to disregard all other factors. The Selection Committee then meets on \\"Selection Saturday\\", the day before each Super Bowl game to elect a new class. To be elected, a finalist must receive at least 80 percent support from the Board, with at least four, but no more than eight, candidates being elected annually. =2021 Centennial Slate= In 2020, a special Blue-Ribbon Panel selected an additional 15 new members, known as the Centennial Slate, to be inducted into the Hall of Fame to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the NFL. Among these 15 members, ten would be seniors, three contributors, and two coaches. On January 11 during the weekend of the NFL Divisional playoffs, Hall of Fame president David Baker went on the set of The NFL Today to personally tell Bill Cowher, who was working as an analyst on that pregame show, that he was selected as one of the members of the Centennial Slate. One day later, Baker went on the set of Fox NFL Sunday to inform Jimmy Johnson, working as an analyst on Fox's studio show, that he was also selected. The rest of the Centennial Slate members were revealed on January 15. The remaining 13 members of the Centennial Slate elected to the Hall of Fame in 2020 are: Jim Covert, Winston Hill, Harold Carmichael, Duke Slater, Ed Sprinkle, Steve Sabol, Alex Karras, Bobby Dillon, Donnie Shell, George Young, Cliff Harris, Mac Speedie, and former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001096785/article/pro-football- hall-of-fame-centennial-class-revealed They will be part of the 2021 class, as there will be no Hall of Fame Class of 2020 as announced by the Hall in June 2020. =Enshrinement ceremony= A football signed by the 1974 Pro Football Hall of Fame enshrinement class The enshrinement ceremony is the main event of the annual Enshrinement Week Powered by Johnson Controls that kicks off every NFL season. The celebration is held in Canton, throughout the week surrounding the enshrinement ceremony. All members of the Hall of Fame are invited to attend the annual ceremony. Enshrinees do not go into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a member of a certain team. Rather, all of an enshrinee's affiliations are listed equally. While the Baseball Hall of Fame plaques generally depict each of their inductees wearing a particular club's cap (with a few exceptions, such as Catfish Hunter and Greg Maddux), the bust sculptures of each Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee make no reference to any specific team. In addition to the bust that goes on permanent display at the Hall of Fame, inductees receive a distinctive Gold Jacket and previous inductees nearly always wear theirs when participating at the new inductee ceremonies. Previous induction ceremonies were held during the next day (Sunday from 1999–2005, Saturday in 2006), situated on the steps of the Hall of Fame building. Starting in 2002, the ceremony was moved to Fawcett Stadium (now Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium), where it was held from 1963 to 1965. Since 2007, the enshrinement ceremony has been held on the Saturday night, since 2017 two days after the Hall of Fame Game. Hall of Fame Game The Hall of Fame Game, the annual NFL preseason opener, is played in Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium at Johnson Controls Hall of Fame Village in Canton, Ohio. In 2017, the Hall of Fame Game was held for the first time on Thursday night. The preseason classic kicks off Enshrinement Week Powered by Johnson Controls and officially kicks off the NFL preseason. Criticism Sign at the old entrance to the PFHF The small number of candidates elected each year has helped foster what some perceive as an inequality of representation at certain positions or in certain categories of player, with defensive players in general and defensive backs and outside linebackers in particular, special teams players, wide receivers, deserving players who primarily played on bad teams, and those from the \\"seniors\\" category, being slighted. This has included a 2009 The New York Times article which criticized the Hall for not including punter Ray Guy on its ballot, also noting that the Hall did not have an inductee at the time representing the position. (At least two inductees, Sammy Baugh and Yale Lary, punted in addition to playing other positions.) Guy was eventually inducted as part of the 2014 class for the Hall of Fame. There has also been criticism that certain players get overlooked because their team underproduced during their careers. The Pro Football Hall of Fame is unique among North American major league sports halls of fame in that officials have generally been excluded from the Hall. Only one official, 1966 inductee Hugh \\"Shorty\\" Ray, has been enshrined. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and Hockey Hall of Fame have each inducted game officials as members. In part to rectify the lack of officials and other off-field contributors, the Hall of Fame added a “Contributors” committee beginning with the class of 2015, which will nominate officials, general managers, owners and other positions that have historically been overlooked by the committee at large.King, Peter (October 21, 2014). Behind the HOF’s New Contributor Committee. SI.com. Retrieved October 21, 2014. Another prominent absence from the Hall is sports-journalist Howard Cosell, who has yet to be awarded the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award despite his well-known association with Monday Night Football. An August 2010 Sports Illustrated article hints that Cosell may have even been \\"blacklisted\\" by the NFL. As the late 2010s approached, a number of controversial and polarizing figures began to reach eligibility for the Hall. For example, Darren Sharper's career achievements make him an indisputable candidate for the Hall, but there is debate over whether he should be inducted due to his conviction on multiple rape charges after he retired. Terrell Owens's exclusion from the Hall in his first two years of eligibility despite his strong individual statistics was a subject of public debate. Owens was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2018, but refused to attend the enshrinement ceremony.

This is a marine sand of Jurassic age (Bajocian stage), deposited as part of an estuary sequence and overlain by a sequence of limestones and mudrocks. Significant amounts of the sand have been replaced or displaced by iron minerals, giving an average ore grade of around 25 wt% iron. To the west the iron ores have been moderately exploited for a very long time, but their high phosphorus content made them difficult to smelt and produced iron of poor quality until the development of the Bessemer steel-making process and the \\"basic slag\\" smelting chemistry, which combine to make high-quality steelmaking possible from these unprepossessing ores. The Northampton Sands were a strategic resource for the United Kingdom in the run-up to World War II, being the best-developed bulk iron-producing processes wholly free from dependence on imported materials.

It is a large duck with pure white plumage, a pink bill, orange legs and feet, an unusually large keel, and a horizontal stance with its body parallel to the ground. The precise origins of the breed are unclear, but raising white ducks became popular in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, in the 18th century owing to the demand for white feathers as a filler for quilts. Over the 19th century selective breeding for size, shape and colour led to the Aylesbury duck. Duck rearing became a major industry in Aylesbury in the 19th century. The ducks were bred on farms in the surrounding countryside. Fertilised eggs were brought into the town's \\"Duck End\\", where local residents would rear the ducklings in their homes. The opening of a railway to Aylesbury in 1839 enabled cheap and quick transport to the markets of London, and duck rearing became highly profitable. By the 1860s the duck rearing industry began to move out of Aylesbury into the surrounding towns and villages, and the industry in Aylesbury itself began to decline. In 1873 the Pekin duck was introduced to the United Kingdom. Although its meat was thought to have a poorer flavour than that of the Aylesbury duck, the Pekin was hardier and cheaper to raise. Many breeders switched to the Pekin duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the Pekin duck, inbreeding, and disease in the pure-bred Aylesbury strain and the rising cost of duck food meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline. The First World War badly damaged the remaining duck industry in Buckinghamshire, wiping out the small scale producers and leaving only a few large farms. Disruption caused by the Second World War further damaged the industry. By the 1950s only one significant flock of Aylesbury ducks remained in Buckinghamshire, and by 1966 there were no duck-breeding or -rearing businesses of any size remaining in Aylesbury itself. Although there is only one surviving flock of pure Aylesbury ducks in the United Kingdom and the breed is critically endangered in the United States, the Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury, and appears on the coat of arms of Aylesbury and on the club badge of Aylesbury United. Origins and description alt=large white duck The precise origin of the Aylesbury duck is unclear. Before the 18th century, duck breeds were rarely recorded in England, and the common duck, bred for farming, was a domesticated form of the wild mallard. The common duck varied in colour, and as in the wild, white ducks would occasionally occur. White ducks were particularly prized, as their feathers were popular as a filler for quilts. In the 18th century selective breeding of white common ducks led to a white domestic duck, generally known as the English White. Since at least the 1690s ducks had been farmed in Aylesbury, and raising English Whites became popular in Aylesbury and the surrounding villages. By 1813 it was remarked that \\"ducks form a material article at market from Aylesbury and places adjacent: they are white, and as it seems of an early breed: they are bred and brought up by poor people, and sent to London by the weekly carriers\\". The duck farmers of Aylesbury went to great lengths to ensure the ducks retained their white colouring, keeping them clear of dirty water, soil with a high iron content and bright sunlight, all of which could discolour the ducks' feathers. Over time, selective breeding of the English White for size and colour gradually led to the development of the Aylesbury duck. A rather large duck breed, the Aylesbury duck has pure white plumage and bright orange legs and feet. Its legs are placed midway along the body and it stands with its underside parallel to the ground, giving it a body described as \\"boat-shaped\\". It has a relatively long and thin swan-like neck, and a long pink bill which comes straight out from the head. An Aylesbury duckling incubates in the egg for 28 days. Until eight weeks after hatching, the time of their first moult, ducks and drakes (females and males) are almost indistinguishable. After moulting, males have two or three curved tail feathers and a fainter, huskier quack than the female. By one year of age, females and males grow to an average weight of respectively, although males can reach around . Unlike the Rouen duck, the other popular meat variety in England in the 19th century, Aylesbury ducks lay eggs from early November. Aylesbury ducks fatten quickly and by eight weeks after hatching weigh up to , large enough to eat but still young and extremely tender. Consequently, their meat came onto the market from February onwards, after the close of the game season but before the earliest spring chickens were on sale. Rouen ducks, whose mallard-like coloration made them less valuable, lay eggs from early February and take six months to grow large enough to eat. As a consequence, Aylesbury ducks were sold primarily in the spring and summer, and Rouen ducks in the autumn and winter. Aylesbury duck farming Unlike most livestock farming in England at this time, the duck breeders and duck rearers of Aylesbury formed two separate groups. (subscription required) Stock ducks—i.e., ducks kept for breeding—were kept on farms in the countryside of the Aylesbury Vale, away from the polluted air and water of the town. This kept the ducks healthy, and meant a higher number of fertile eggs. Stock ducks would be chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females at any given time. The females would be kept for around a year before mating, typically to an older male. They would then generally be replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding. Stock ducks were allowed to roam freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among the duck breeders; breeders would label their ducks with markings on the neck or head. The stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after the rendering of animal fat). As ducks lay their eggs at night, the ducks would be brought indoors overnight. Stock Aylesbury ducks at alt=Pond with a large number of white ducks swimming in it and standing on grass around it. Female Aylesbury ducks would not sit still for the 28 days necessary for their eggs to hatch, and as a consequence the breeders would not allow mothers to sit on their own eggs. Instead the fertilised eggs would be collected and transferred to the \\"duckers\\" of Aylesbury's Duck End. =Rearing= The duckers of Aylesbury would buy eggs from the breeders, or be paid by a breeder to raise the ducks on their behalf, and would raise the ducklings in their homes between November and August as a secondary source of income. Duckers were typically skilled labourers, who invested surplus income in ducklings. Many of the tasks related to rearing the ducks would be carried out by the women of the household, particularly the care of newly hatched ducklings. The eggs would be divided into batches of 13, and placed under broody chickens. In the last week of the four-week incubation period the eggs would be sprinkled daily with warm water to soften the shells and allow the ducklings to hatch. Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid and thrive best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into groups of three or four ducklings, each accompanied by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would be kept in groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would be kept in every room in the ducker's cottage, but towards the end of the 19th century they were kept in outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather. The aim of the ducker was to get every duckling as fat as possible by the age of eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high- protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market. While ducks are naturally aquatic, swimming can be dangerous to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings would be taken for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly. Although there were a few large- scale duck rearing operations in Aylesbury, raising thousands of ducklings each season, the majority of Aylesbury's duckers would raise between 400 and 1,000 ducklings each year. Because ducking was a secondary occupation, it was not listed in Aylesbury's census returns or directories and it is impossible to know how many people were engaged in it at any given time. Kelly's Directory for 1864 does not list a single duck farmer in Aylesbury, but an 1885 book comments that: The Duck End was one of the poorer districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19th century it had no sewers or refuse collections. The area had a number of open ditches filled with stagnant water, and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and no running water. Faeces from the duck ponds permeated the local soil and seeped into the cottages through cracks in the floors. =Slaughter and sale= When the ducklings were ready for slaughter, the duckers would generally kill them on their own premises. The slaughter would generally take place in the morning, to ensure the ducks would be ready for market in the evening. To keep the meat as white as possible, the ducks would be suspended upside down and their necks broken backwards, and held in this position until their blood had run towards their heads. They were kept in this position for ten minutes before being plucked, as otherwise their blood would collect in those parts of the body from which the feathers had been plucked. The plucking was generally carried out by the women of the household. The plucked carcasses would be sent to market, and the feathers would be sold direct to London dealers. The market for duck meat in Aylesbury itself was small, and the ducks were generally sent to London for sale. By the 1750s Richard Pococke recorded that four cartloads of ducks were sent from Aylesbury to London every Saturday, and in the late 18th and early 19th centuries the ducks continued to be sent over the Chiltern Hills to London by packhorse or cart. On 15 June 1839 the entrepreneur and former Member of Parliament for Buckingham, Sir Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet, opened the Aylesbury Railway. Built under the direction of Robert Stephenson, it connected the London and Birmingham Railway's Cheddington railway station on the West Coast Main Line to Aylesbury High Street railway station in eastern Aylesbury. On 1 October 1863 the Wycombe Railway also built a line to Aylesbury, from Princes Risborough railway station to a station on the western side of Aylesbury (the present-day Aylesbury railway station). The arrival of the railway had a powerful impact on the duck industry, and up to a ton of ducks in a night were being shipped from Aylesbury to Smithfield Market in London by 1850. A routine became established in which salesmen would provide the duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, take them to the stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, in return for a flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year. Developments in the late 19th century In 1845, the first National Poultry Show was held, at the Zoological Gardens in London; one of the classes of poultry exhibited was \\"Aylesbury or other white variety\\". The personal interest of Queen Victoria in poultry farming, and its inclusion in the Great Exhibition of 1851, further raised public interest in poultry. From 1853 the Royal Agricultural Society and the Bath and West of England Society, the two most prominent agricultural societies in England, included poultry sections in their annual agricultural shows. This in turn caused smaller local poultry shows to develop across the country. Breeders would choose potential exhibition ducks from among newly hatched ducklings in March and April, and they would be given a great deal of extra attention. They would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to the maximum weight, and would be allowed out for a few hours each day to keep them in as good a physical condition as possible. Before the show, their legs and feet would be washed, their bills trimmed with a knife and sandpapered smooth, and their feathers brushed with linseed oil. While most breeders would give the ducks a healthy meal before the show to calm them, some breeders would force-feed the ducks with sausage or worms, to get them to as heavy a weight as possible. Exhibition standards judged an Aylesbury duck primarily on size, shape and colour. This encouraged the breeding of larger ducks, with pronounced exaggerated keels, and loose baggy skin. By the beginning of the 20th century the Aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains, one bred for appearance and one for meat. =Pekin ducks= alt=Five white ducks In 1873 the Pekin duck was introduced from China to Britain for the first time. Superficially similar in appearance to an Aylesbury duck, a Pekin is white with orange legs and bill, with its legs near the rear, giving it an upright stance while on land. Although not thought to have such a delicate flavour as the Aylesbury, the Pekin was hardier, a more prolific layer, fattened more quickly, (subscription required) and was roughly the same size as an Aylesbury at nine weeks. Aylesbury ducks, meanwhile, were becoming inbred, meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and the ducks were more susceptible to disease. Exhibition standards had led to selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders, despite it being unpopular with dealers and consumers. Poultry show judges also admired the long neck and upright posture of Pekin ducks over the boat- like stance of the Aylesbury. Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury- Pekin cross ducks did not have the delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much cheaper to raise. Until the mid-19th century duck rearing was concentrated on the Duck End, but by the 1860s it had spread to many other towns and villages in the area, particularly Weston Turville and Haddenham. Contamination of Aylesbury's soil by years of duck rearing, and new public health legislation which ended many traditional practices, caused the decline of the duck rearing industry in the Duck End, and by the 1890s the majority of Aylesbury ducks were raised in the villages rather than the town itself. Population shifts and the improved national rail network reduced the need to rear ducks near London, and large duck farms opened in Lancashire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire. Although the number of ducks raised nationwide continued to grow, between 1890 and 1900 the number of ducks raised in the Aylesbury area remained static, and from 1900 it began to drop. Decline alt=Drawing of a large white duck and four ducklings By the time Beatrix Potter's 1908 The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck—about an Aylesbury duck although set in Cumbria—caused renewed interest in the breed, the Aylesbury duck was in steep decline. The duckers of Buckinghamshire had generally failed to introduce technological improvements such as the incubator, and inbreeding had dangerously weakened the breed. Meanwhile, the cost of duck food had risen fourfold over the 19th century, and from 1873 onwards competition from Pekin and Pekin cross ducks was undercutting Aylesbury ducks at the marketplace. The First World War devastated the remaining duckers of Buckinghamshire. The price of duck food rose steeply while the demand for luxury foodstuffs fell, and wartime restructuring ended the beneficial financial arrangements with the railway companies. By the end of the war small-scale duck rearing in the Aylesbury Vale had vanished, with duck raising dominated by a few large duck farms. Shortages of duck food in the Second World War caused further disruption to the industry, and almost all duck farming in the Aylesbury Vale ended. A 1950 \\"Aylesbury Duckling Day\\" campaign to boost the reputation of the Aylesbury duck had little effect; (subscription required) by the end of the 1950s the last significant farms had closed, other than a single flock in Chesham owned by Mr L. T. Waller, and by 1966 there were no duck breeders or rearers of any size remaining in Aylesbury. (subscription required) the Waller family's farm in Chesham remains in business, the last surviving flock of pure Aylesbury meat ducks in the country. Aylesbury ducks were imported into the United States in 1840, although they never became a popular breed. They were, however, added to the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection breeding guidelines in 1876. As of 2013, the breed was listed as critically endangered in the United States by The Livestock Conservancy.  Legacy  The Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury. Aylesbury United F.C. are nicknamed \\"The Ducks\\" and include an Aylesbury duck on their club badge, and the town's coat of arms includes an Aylesbury duck and plaited straw, representing the two historic industries of the town. The Aylesbury Brewery Company, now defunct, featured the Aylesbury duck as its logo, an example of which can still be seen at the Britannia pub. Duck Farm Court is a shopping area of modern Aylesbury located near the historic hamlet of California, close to one of the main breeding grounds for ducks in the town, and there have been two pubs in the town with the name \\"The Duck\\" in recent years; one in Bedgrove that has since been demolished and one in Jackson Road that has recently been renamed.

It is now in the care of English Heritage. The stone used for the construction was alternating bands of dark and light limestone. The lodge is Grade I listed on the National Heritage List for England. Tresham was a Roman Catholic and was imprisoned for a total of fifteen years in the late 16th century for refusing to become a Protestant. On his release in 1593, he designed the Lodge as a protestation of his faith. His belief in the Holy Trinity is represented everywhere in the Lodge by the number three: it has three walls 33 feet long, each with three triangular windows and surmounted by three gargoyles. One wall is inscribed '15', another '93', and the last 'TT'. The building has three floors, upon a basement, and a triangular chimney. Three Latin texts, each 33 letters long, run around the building on each facade. The quotations are: #Aperiatur terra & germinet Salvatorem:Isaiah \\"Let the earth open and … bring forth salvation\\" (Isaiah 45:8) #Quis separabit nos a charitate Christi?:Romans \\"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\\" (Romans 8:35) #Consideravi opera tua, Domine, et expavi : \\"I have contemplated thy works, O Lord, and was afraid\\" (a paraphrase of Habakkuk 3:2Habakkuk) The windows on each floor are of different designs, all equally ornate. The largest, those on the first floor, are in the form of a trefoil, which was the emblem of the Tresham family. The basement windows are small trefoils with a triangular pane at their centre. The windows on the ground floor are of a lozenge design, each having 12 small circular openings surrounding a central cruciform slit. Heraldic shields of various families surround these windows. The slightly raised ground floor has an entrance in the south-east facade. Over the door, beneath Tresham's coat of arms, is the Latin inscription: Tres testimonium dant , meaning \\"The number three bears witness\\" or \\"Tresham bears witness\\" (Tres was the pet name his wife used for Tresham in her letters). Also above the door are the numbers \\"5555\\". The figures are oddly shaped, and architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner speculated that this may once have read \\"3333\\", but that number seems to have no particular significance. It has, however, been pointed out Sir Thomas Tresham's Triangular Lodge - Everything2.com that if 1593 is subtracted from 5555, it leaves 3962 (the date, BC, of the Flood, according to Bede). The principal room on each floor is hexagonal, thus leaving the three corner spaces triangular; one of these spaces contains a spiral staircase, the remaining two are small rooms. The building is crowned, above the quotations on each facade, by three steep gables each surmounted by a three-sided obelisk at the apex. Among the emblems carved on the gables are, on the southeast side, the highly symbolic seven- branched candelabrum within an octagonal plaque, and a heptagonal plaque depicting the seven eyes of God. On the north side are a Pelican in her piety, a symbol of Christ and the Eucharist, and a Hen and Chickens; on the southwest gable are a Dove and Serpent; and the Hand of God touching a globe. The triangular chimney is adorned with the holy monogram \\"IHS\\", a lamb and cross, and a chalice. While the lodge is indisputably a testament to Tresham's faith, it is also an example of the Elizabethan love of allegory. Carved in the gables are the numbers \\"3509\\" and \\"3898\\": these are said to be the dates (BC) of the Creation and the Calling of Abraham. Among the more recent dates carved on the building are 1580, thought to be the date of Tresham's conversion, and also the future (at the time of their carving) dates 1626 and 1641 - to what do they refer? One suggestion is that not only are they divisible by three, but that, when 1593 is subtracted from them, they give 33 and 48, the years in which Jesus and the Virgin Mary are said to have died. The broken inscriptions inscribed on each gable combine to read \\"Respicite non mihi laboravi\\", which means \\"Behold I have not laboured for myself alone\\". The Lodge was the only building Tresham designed which he saw completed before his death in 1605. Nikolaus Pevsner in his The Buildings of England: Northamptonshire states: \\"as a testament of faith this building must be viewed with respect\\". He also considered the lodge so architecturally important that he chose its photograph for the front cover of the first edition (1961) of his book; it also features on the cover of the current edition Northamptonshire Pevsner Architectural Guides: Buildings of England. The Lodge figures prominently in the chapter of Alan Moore's novel Voice of the Fire concerning Tresham's son Francis, a Gunpowder Plot conspirator. Moore, a Northampton native, touches on the history of several local sites in his speculative magical realist history of the town. It is also featured on the cover of the album Sun Structures released in February 2014 by the English psychedelic band Temples, and is visible from the Midland Main Line between Kettering & Market Harborough See also *Lyveden New Bield References  External links  * Rushton Triangular Lodge page at English Heritage * Rushton Triangular Lodge details * 360 degree views of the lodge * * Some of the Lodge's symbolism interpreted on everything2.com * South-west elevation of the lodge, drawn by JA Gotch, 1882 * Details of the upper windows of the lodge (JA Gotch, 1882) * Details of the decoration of the lodge (JA Gotch, 1882) * A Catholic blog with photos and description of Rushton Hall and the Lodge Category:English Heritage sites in Northamptonshire Category:Grade I listed buildings in Northamptonshire Category:Folly buildings in England Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1597 Category:Borough of Kettering Category:Triangular buildings ","title":"Rushton Triangular Lodge"},{"id":"272606","text":"Poland is a country in Central Europe.

The members of this group are likely to influence the person's beliefs and behaviour.Peer group . (n.d.). Dictionary.com. Retrieved October 25, 2012, from http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/peer+group Peer groups contain hierarchies and distinct patterns of behavior. In a high school setting for example, 18 year olds are a peer group with 14 year olds because they share similar and paralleled life experiences in school together. In contrast, teachers do not share students as a peer group because teachers and students fall into two different roles and experiences. During adolescence, peer groups tend to face dramatic changes. Adolescents tend to spend more time with their peers and have less adult supervision. Adolescents' communication shifts during this time as well. They prefer to talk about school and their careers with their parents, and they enjoy talking about sex and other interpersonal relationships with their peers. Children look to join peer groups who accept them, even if the group is involved in negative activities. Children are less likely to accept those who are different from them. Cliques are small groups typically defined by common interests or by friendship. Cliques typically have 2–12 members and tend to be formed by age, gender, race, and social class. Clique members are usually the same in terms of academics and risk behaviors. Cliques can serve as an agent of socialization and social control. Being part of a clique can be advantageous since it may provide a sense of autonomy, a secure social environment, and overall well-being. Crowds are larger, more vaguely defined groups that may not have a friendship base. Crowds serve as peer groups, and they increase in importance during early adolescence, and decrease by late adolescence. The level of involvement in adult institutions and peer culture describes crowds. Socialization At an early age, the peer group becomes an important part of socialization Unlike other agents of socialization, such as family and school, peer groups allow children to escape the direct supervision of adults. Among peers, children learn to form relationships on their own, and have the chance to discuss interests that adults may not share with children, such as clothing and popular music, or may not permit, such as drugs and sex. Peer groups can have great influence or peer pressure on each other's behavior, depending on the amount of pressure. Developmental psychology Developmental psychologists, Lev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget, Erik Erikson, Harry Stack Sullivan, and social learning theorists have all argued that peer relationships provide a unique context for cognitive, social, and emotional development. Modern research echoes these sentiments, showing that social and emotional gains are indeed provided by peer interaction.Siegler, Robert (2006). How Children Develop, Exploring Child Develop Student Media Tool Kit & Scientific American Reader to Accompany How Children Develop. New York: Worth Publishers. Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory focuses on the importance of a child's culture and notes that a child is continually acting in social interactions with others. He also focuses on language development and identifies the zone of proximal development. The Zone of Proximal development is defined as the gap between what a student can do alone and what the student can achieve through teacher assistance. The values and attitudes of the peer group are essential elements in learning. Those who surround themselves with academically focused peers will be more likely to internalize this type of behavior. Piaget's theory of cognitive development identifies four stages of cognitive development. He believes that children actively construct their understanding of the world based on their own experiences. In addition Piaget identified with aspects of development, occurring from middle childhood onwards, for which peer groups are essential. He suggested that children's speech to peers is less egocentric than their speech to adults. Egocentric speech is referring to the speech that is not adapted to what the listener just said. Erikson's stages of psychosocial development include eight stages ranging from birth to old age. He has emphasized the idea that the society, not just the family, influences one's ego and identity through developmental stages. Erikson went on to describe how peer pressure is a key event during the adolescences stage of psychosocial development. In his Latency stage, which includes children from 6–12 years old and this is when the adolescents begin to develop relationships among their peers. Harry Stack Sullivan has developed the Theory of Interpersonal Relations. Sullivan described friendships as providing the following functions: (a) offering consensual validation, (b) bolstering feelings of self-worth, (c) providing affection and a context for intimate disclosure, (d) promoting interpersonal sensitivity, and (e) setting the foundation for romantic and parental relationships. Sullivan believed these functions developed during childhood and that true friendships were formed around the age of 9 or 10. Social learning theorists such as John B. Watson, B.F. Skinner, and Albert Bandura, all argue for the influences of the social group in learning and development. Behaviourism, Operant Learning Theory, and Cognitive Social Learning Theory all consider the role the social world plays on development.Shaffer, David R.. \\"Theories of Human Development.\\" Developmental psychology: childhood and adolescence. 5th ed. Pacific Grove: Brooks/Cole Pub., 1999. 40–74. Print. In The Nurture Assumption and No Two Alike, psychologist Judith Rich Harris suggests that an individual's peer group significantly influences their intellectual and personal development. Several longitudinal studies support the conjecture that peer groups significantly affect scholastic achievement, but relatively few studies have examined the effect peer groups have on tests of cognitive ability. However, there is some evidence that peer groups influence tests of cognitive ability. Positive attributes (advantages) A group of children playing together in Bolivia =Serve as a source of information= Peer groups provide perspective outside of the individual's viewpoints. Members inside peer groups also learn to develop relationships with others in the social system. Peers, particularly group members, become important social referents forYouniss, J., & Smollar, J. (1985). Adolescents' relations with mothers, fathers, and friends.Chicago: University of Chicago Press. teaching other members customs, social norms, and different ideologies.Clausen, John A. (ed.) (1968) Socialization and Society, Boston: Little Brown and Company. p5 =Teach gender roles= Peer groups can also serve as a venue for teaching members gender roles. Through gender-role socialization, group members learn about sex differences, and social and cultural expectations. While boys and girls differ greatly, there is not a one-to-one link between sex and gender roles with males always being masculine and females always being feminine. Both genders can contain different levels of masculinity and femininity.Spence, J. T., & Helmreich, R. (1978). Masculinity and femininity. Austin: University of Texas Press. Peer groups can consist of all males, all females, or both males and females. Studies show that the majority of peer groups are unisex. =Serve as a practicing venue to adulthood= Adolescent peer groups provide support as teens assimilate into adulthood. Major changes include: decreasing dependence on parents, increasing feelings of self-sufficiency, and connecting with a much larger social network.Erikson, E. H. (1968). Identity: Youth and crisis. New York: Norton. Adolescents are expanding their perspective beyond the family and learning how to negotiate relationships with others in different parts of the social system. Peers, particularly group members, become important social referents. Peer groups also influence individual members' attitudes and behaviours on many cultural and social issues, such as: drug use, violence, and academic achievement. and even the development and expression of prejudice.Aboud, F. E. (2005). The development of prejudice in childhood and adolescence. In J. F.Dovidio, P.Glick, & L. A.Rudman (Eds.), On the nature of prejudice: Fifty years afterAllport (pp. 310–326). Malden, MA: Blackwell.Fishbein, H. D. (1996). Peer prejudice and discrimination: Evolutionary, cultural, and developmental dynamics. Boulder, CO: Westview Press. =Teach unity and collective behaviour in life= Peer groups provide an influential social setting in which group norms are developed and enforced through socialization processes that promote in-group similarity.Eder, D., & Nenga, S. K. (2003). Socialization in adolescence. In J.Delamater (Ed.), Handbook of social psychology (pp. 157–182). New York: Kluwer Academic Peer groups' cohesion is determined and maintained by such factors as group communication, group consensus, and group conformity concerning attitude and behavior. As members of peer groups interconnect and agree on what defines them as a group, a normative code arises. This normative code can become very rigid, such as when deciding on group behavior and clothing attire. Member deviation from the strict normative code can lead to rejection from the group. =Identity formation= Peer groups (friends group) can help individuals form their own identity. Identity formation is a developmental process where a person acquires a sense of self. One of the major factors that influence the formation of a person's identity is his or her peers. Studies have shown that peers provide normative regulation, and that they provide a staging ground for the practice of social behaviors. This allows individuals to experiment with roles and discover their identities. The identity formation process is an important role in an individual's development. Erik Erikson emphasized the importance of identity formation, and he illustrated the steps one takes in developing his or her sense of self. He believed this process occurs throughout one's entire life. Negative attributes (disadvantages) =Peer pressure= The term peer pressure is often used to describe instances where an individual feels indirectly pressured into changing their behavior to match that of their peers. Taking up smoking and underage drinking are two of the best known examples. In spite of the often negative connotations of the term, peer pressure can be used positively, for example, to encourage other peers to study, or not to engage in activities such as the ones discussed above. Although peer pressure is not isolated to one age group, it is usually most common during the adolescent stage. Adolescence is a period characterized by experimentation, and adolescents typically spend a lot of time with their peers in social contexts. Teenagers compel each other to go along with certain beliefs or behaviors, and studies have shown that boys are more likely to give in to it than girls. There has been much research done to gain a better understanding about the effects of peer pressure, and this research will allow parents to handle and understand their children's behaviors and obstacles they will face due to their peer groups. Learning how peer pressure impacts individuals is a step to minimizing the negative effects it leads to. =Future problems= Success of peer relationships is linked to later psychological development and to academic achievement. Therefore, if one does not have successful peer relationships it may lead to developmental delays and poor academic achievement—perhaps even in-completion of a high school degree. Children with poor peer relationships may also experience job related and marital problems later in life. =Risk behaviors= Several studies have shown that peer groups are powerful agents of risk behaviors in adolescence. Adolescents typically replace family with peers regarding social and leisure activities, and many problematic behaviors occur in the context of these groups. A study done in 2012 focused on adolescents' engagement in risk behaviors. Participants completed a self-report measure of identity commitment, which explores values, beliefs, and aspirations, as well as a self-report that measures perceived peer group pressure and control. Both peer group pressure and control were positively related to risky behaviors. However, adolescents who were more committed to a personal identity had lower rates of risk behaviors. Overall, this study shows us that adolescent identity development may help prevent negative effects of peer pressure in high-risk adolescents. =Aggression and prosocial behavior= Social behaviors can be promoted or discouraged by social groups, and several studies have shown that aggression and prosociality are susceptible to peer influence. A longitudinal study done in 2011 focused on these two behaviors. A sample of adolescents was followed over a one-year period, and results showed that adolescents who joined an aggressive group were more likely to increase their aggression levels. Also, adolescents were likely to display prosocial behaviors that were similar to the consistent behaviors of the group they were in. An adolescent's peer group plays a role in shaping him or her into an adult, and the lack of positive behavior can lead to consequences in the future. =Sexual promiscuity= Adolescence is also characterized by physical changes, new emotions, and sexual urges, and teenagers are likely to participate in sexual activity. A longitudinal study done in 2012 followed a group of adolescents for thirteen years. Self-reports, peer nominations, teacher ratings, counselor ratings, and parent reports were collected, and results showed a strong correlation between deviant peer groups and sexual promiscuity. Many teens claimed that the reasons for having sex at a young age include peer pressure or pressure from their partner. The effects of sexual activity at a young age are of great concern. Pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases are only a few of the consequences that can occur. Adolescents and their peer groups =Gavin's study= In one cross-sectional, correlational study, four different developmental stages were examined: preadolescence (Grades 5 and 6), early adolescence (Grades 7 and 8), middle adolescence (Grades 9 and 10) and late adolescence (Grades 11 and 12). Self-report measures were used in which adolescents completed questionnaires. First, the students rated the importance of being in a popular group. Next, positive and negative behaviour were assessed. The extent to which students were bothered by negative behaviour targeted at them by others in their groups was also assessed. Structural group properties were also examined, including: group leadership or status hierarchy, group permeability, and group conformity. Researchers found that middle adolescents reported placing more importance on being in a popular group and perceived more group conformity and leadership within their groups than pre- and late adolescents. Early and middle adolescents also reported more negative interactions and fewer positive interactions with group members and more negative interactions with those not part of their peer groups. Girls reported having more positive group interactions, being more bothered by negative interactions, and having more permeable group boundaries. Boys reported more negative interactions with those outside their groups and are more likely to have leaders in their peer groups.Researchers believe that the decrease in conformity throughout adolescence relates to the decrease in importance of leadership in late adolescence because having a group leader provides a person to model oneself after. They also note the relationship between the importance of being in a popular peer group and conformity. Both become less important in late adolescence, showing that it is less important to conform when the value of group membership decreases. It is believed that positive interactions outside of peer groups increase and negative interactions outside of peer groups decrease by late adolescence because older adolescents feel more comfortable and have less need to control the behaviours of others. Findings that boys have more leaders are consistent with research showing that boys partake in more dominance struggles. =Tarrant's study= A questionnaire was handed out to 58 males and 57 females, aged 14–15 in the Midlands region of the UK. The first section dealt with group structure and activities of participants' peer groups. Participants were asked how many people were in their group, the gender composition of the group, frequency of group meetings, and the group's usual meeting places. The second section addressed the participants' levels of identification with their peer groups. The next section of the questionnaire was an intergroup comparison task in which participants compared their peer group to an outgroup. The comparison referred to how sixteen different adjectives \\"fit\\" or \\"described\\" both their ingroup and outgroup. The final part of the questionnaire was designed to check the manipulation of the adjective valence. In this section, participants rated the desirability of the above sixteen adjectives in their own opinions. Findings supported social identity theory as participants consistently favoured the ingroup in two ways: the ingroup was always associated with a greater number of positive characteristics compared to the outgroup, and the more a participant identified with the ingroup, the higher their evaluations were for it. =Same race peer groups= Consistent with the dictionary definition of peer groups, youth tend to form groups based on similarities. It has been found that one of these similarities is by race.Graham, S., Taylor, A. Z., & Ho, A. Y. (2009). Race and ethnicity in peer relations research. Handbook of peer interactions, relationships, and groups, 394–413. Preference for same race grows stronger as youth develop. When Latino and Caucasian youth were given surveys asking them to indicate who in their school they had the highest preference to spend time with, they both nominated peers of their same race over peers of different races. This is especially prevalent in classrooms and schools that have a clear cut majority and minority racial groups. Though benefits of homophily are met, preference for one's own racial group can lead to rejection of the racial out group, which can cause stress for both groups particularly in females.Sunwolf & Leets, 2004 =Cross race peer groups= For classrooms and schools that have a more equal distribution of racial groups, there can be more socialization across peer groups. Cross racial peers groups can be very beneficial, lowering prejudice and increasing prosocial behaviors. Having a cross racial friend has also been shown to give youth a higher status and feel more socially satisfied. Diverse peer groups also lower the feelings of victimization felt by youth.

He is known for his ceramic vases, tapestries and cross- dressing, as well as his observations of the contemporary arts scene, and for dissecting British \\"prejudices, fashions and foibles\\". Perry's vases have classical forms and are decorated in bright colours, depicting subjects at odds with their attractive appearance. There is a strong autobiographical element in his work, in which images of Perry as \\"Claire\\", his female alter- ego, and \\"Alan Measles\\", his childhood teddy bear, often appear. He has made a number of documentary television programmes and has curated exhibitions. He has published two autobiographies, Grayson Perry: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Girl (2007) and The Descent of Man (2016), written and illustrated a graphic novel, Cycle of Violence (2012), written a book about art, Playing to the Gallery (2014), and published his illustrated Sketchbooks (2016). Various books describing his work have been published. In 2013 he delivered the BBC Reith Lectures.Simon Kelner, \\"How Grayson Perry and The Reith Lectures will restore your faith in the BBC\\". The Independent, 16 October 2013. Accessed 28 December 2017. Perry has had solo exhibitions at the Bonnefantenmuseum, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, the Barbican Centre, the British Museum and the Serpentine Gallery in London, the Arnolfini in Bristol, The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, and the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Japan. His work is held in the permanent collections of the British Council and Arts Council, Crafts Council, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Tate and Victoria and Albert Museum, London. He was awarded the Turner Prize in 2003. He was interviewed about the win and resulting press in Sarah Thornton's Seven Days in the Art World. In 2008 he was ranked number 32 in The Daily Telegraph's list of the \\"100 most powerful people in British culture\\". In 2012, Perry was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork—the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover—to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life. Personal life =Early life and education= Born into a working-class family, Perry was four years old when his father, Tom, left home after discovering his mother, Jean, was having an affair with a milkman, whom she later married and who Perry has claimed was violent. Subsequently, he spent an unhappy childhood moving between his parents and created a fantasy world based around his teddy in order to cope with his sense of anxiety. He considers that a person’s early experiences are important in shaping their aesthetic and sexuality. Following the encouragement of his art teacher, Perry decided to study art. He did an art foundation course at Braintree College of Further Education from 1978 to 1979. He spent a short period of his school life at King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford (KEGS), but mainly he studied for a BA in fine art at Portsmouth College of Art and Design, graduating in 1982.Wilson, Andrew. Grayson Perry: General Artist He had an interest in film and exhibited his first piece of pottery at a New Contemporaries show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1980. In the months following his graduation he joined The Neo Naturists, a group started by Christine Binnie to revive the \\"true sixties spirit – which involves living one's life more or less naked and occasionally manifesting it into a performance for which the main theme is body paint\\".Dawson, p. 81 They put on events at galleries and other venues. In this time Perry was living in squats in central London. When he left for Portsmouth in 1979, his stepfather told him \\"Don't come back\\". Perry has been estranged from his mother since the 1990s. =Modern day= As of 2010 he lives in north London with his wife, the author and psychotherapist Philippa Perry. They have one daughter, Florence, born in 1992. In 2007 Perry curated an exhibition of art by prisoners and ex- offenders entitled Insider Art at the Institute of Contemporary Arts presented by the Koestler Trust, a charity which promotes art as rehabilitation in prisons, young offenders institutions and secure psychiatric units. He described the art works as \\"raw and all the more powerful for that\\". In 2011 he returned to the annual Koestler Trust exhibition, this time held at London's Southbank Centre and judged the award winners in Art by Offenders with Will Self and Emma Bridgewater. In 2015 he was appointed to succeed Kwame Kwei-Armah as chancellor of University of the Arts London. Perry is a keen mountain biker and motorcyclist. Perry is a supporter of the Labour Party, and has designed works of art to raise funds for the party. In September 2015, Perry endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. Perry said he would back Corbyn as he was \\"doing something interesting for the political debate.\\" He added: \\"I think he's gold.\\" In October 2016, he said that Jeremy Corbyn had \\"no chance of winning an election\\". =Cross-dressing= Perry describes his first sexual experience at the age of seven when he tied himself up in his pyjamas. From an early age he liked to dress in women's clothes and in his teens realised that he was a transvestite. At the age of 15 he moved in with his father's family in Chelmsford, where he began to go out dressed as a woman. When he was discovered by his father he said he would stop but his stepmother told everyone about it and a few months later threw him out. He returned to his mother and stepfather at Great Bardfield. Perry dressed as Claire, promoting a 2017 exhibition Perry frequently appears in public dressed as a woman, and he has described his female alter-ego, \\"Claire\\", variously as \\"a 19th century reforming matriarch, a middle-England protester for No More Art, an aero- model-maker, or an Eastern European Freedom Fighter\\",Grayson Perry: guerrilla tactics, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, 2002 and \\"a fortysomething woman living in a Barratt home, the kind of woman who eats ready meals and can just about sew on a button\\".Perry, pp. 8-9 [more detail needed] In his work Perry includes pictures of himself in women's clothes: for example Mother of All Battles (1996) is a photograph of Claire holding a gun and wearing a dress, in ethnic eastern European style, embroidered with images of war, exhibited at his 2002 Guerrilla Tactics show. One critic has called Perry \\"The social critic from hell\\". Perry has designed many of Claire's outfits himself. Also, fashion students at Central Saint Martins art college in London take part in an annual competition to design new dresses for Claire. An exhibition, Making Himself Claire: Grayson Perry's Dresses, was held at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, from November 2017 to February 2018.\\"Grayson Perry's dresses really are works of art in new exhibition\\", BBC News, 3 November 2017. Accessed 9 January 2018\\"Making Himself Claire: Grayson Perry’s Dresses: 4 November 2017 – 4 February 2018\\", Walker Art Gallery. Accessed 9 January 2018 Work As well as ceramics, Perry has worked in printmaking, drawing, embroidery and other textile work, film and performance. He has written a graphic novel, Cycle of Violence. =Ceramics= The Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam mounted a solo exhibition of his work in 2002, Guerrilla Tactics. It was partly for this work that he was awarded the Turner Prize in 2003, the first time it was given to a ceramic artist. Perry's work refers to several ceramic traditions, including Greek pottery and folk art.DT, p.70 [more detail needed] He has said, \\"I like the whole iconography of pottery. It hasn't got any big pretensions to being great public works of art, and no matter how brash a statement I make, on a pot it will always have certain humility ... [F]or me the shape has to be classical invisible: then you've got a base that people can understand\\".Perry, pp.14 and 24 [more detail needed] His vessels are made by coiling, a traditional method. Most have a complex surface employing many techniques, including \\"glazing, incision, embossing, and the use of photographic transfers\\", which requires several firings. To some he adds sprigs, little relief sculptures stuck to the surface. The high degree of skill required by his ceramics and their complexity distances them from craft pottery. It has been said that these methods are not used for decorative effect but to give meaning. Perry challenges the idea, implicit in the craft tradition, that pottery is merely decorative or utilitarian and cannot express ideas. In his work Perry reflects upon his upbringing as a boy, his stepfather's anger and the absence of proper guidance about male conduct. Perry's understanding of the roles in his family is portrayed in Using My Family, from 1998, where a teddy bear provides affection, and the contemporaneous The Guardians, which depicts his mother and stepfather. Much of Perry's work contains sexually explicit content. Some of his sexual imagery has been described as \\"obscene sadomasochistic sex scenes\\". He also has a reputation for depicting child abuse and yet there are no works depicting sexual child abuse although We've Found the Body of your Child, 2000 hints at emotional child abuse and child neglect. In other work he juxtaposes decorative clichés like flowers with weapons and war. Perry combines various techniques as a \\"guerrilla tactic\\", using the approachable medium of pottery to provoke thought. =Tapestries= Perry created the 15 m x 3 m The Walthamstow Tapestry in 2009. The large woven tapestry bears hundreds of brand names surrounding large figures in the stages of life from birth to death.\\"The Walthamstow Tapestry by Grayson Perry, 2009\\", Paragon Press. Accessed 20 December 2017. Perry's 2012 TV documentary series All In The Best Possible Taste with Grayson Perry, about class \\"taste\\" variables, included him making large tapestries, called The Vanity of Small Differences.\\"Grayson Perry: The Vanity of Small Differences\\", British Council. Accessed 4 January 2018. Their format was inspired by William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress. Of the tapestries, Perry says, > The Vanity of Small Differences consists of six tapestries that tell the > story of Tim Rakewell. Some of the characters, incidents and objects I have > included I encountered whilst filming All in the Best Possible Taste. The > tapestries tell a story of class mobility. I think nothing has such a strong > influence on our aesthetic taste as the social class we grow up in. The sketches were translated using Adobe Photoshop to design the finished images and the tapestries were woven on a computer controlled loom. Perry produced a pair of large-scale tapestries for A House for Essex, called The Essex House Tapestries: The Life of Julie Cope in 2015. =A House for Essex (\\"Julie's House\\") (2012–2015)= A House for Essex (\\"Julie's House\\"), a commission for Living Architecture. In 2015 the external work was completed on a holiday home in Wrabness, Essex,Tendring District Council plannnig application 12/00880/FUL created by Perry working with Fashion Architecture Taste (FAT). It overlooks the River Stour, after a commission from Living Architecture, the charity founded by the philosopher Alain de Botton, and is known as both A House for Essex, and \\"Julie's House.\\" The house encapsulates the story of Julie May Cope, a fictional Essex woman, \\"Born in a flood-struck Canvey Island in 1953 and mown down last year by a curry delivery driver in Colchester\\". Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Ellis Woodman said, \\"Sporting a livery of green and white ceramic tiles, telephone-box red joinery and a gold roof, it is not easy to miss. ... Decoration is everywhere: from the external tiles embossed with motifs referencing Julie's rock-chick youth to extravagant tapestries recording her life's full narrative. Perry has contributed ceramic sculptures, modelled on Irish Sheelanagigs, which celebrate her as a kind of latter-day earth mother while the delivery driver's moped has even been repurposed as a chandelier suspended above the double-height living room.\\" Perry made a variety of artwork used inside the house, depicting Julie Cope's life. He made a series of large-scale tapestries, The Essex House Tapestries: The Life of Julie Cope, which include \\"A Perfect Match\\" (2015) and \\"In Its Familiarity, Golden\\" (2015), and for the bedrooms, \\"Julie and Rob\\" (2013) and \\"Julie and Dave\\" (2015).

In 2014, Perry presented a three-part documentary series for Channel 4, Who Are You?, on identity.

Regular mail service in Iceland was first established by a charter of 13 May 1776, and on 1 January 1873, Iceland issued its first postage stamps. The design was the same as for the Danish numeral issue of the time (numeral of value surmounted by a crown all inside an oval), denominated with values ranging from 2 to 16 skilling, and inscribed ÍSLAND. All are scarce or rare, and used copies are especially hard to find. Chronology 20 aurar, 1882 (used at Vopnafjörður?) In 1876 the currency changed to eyrir (pl. aurar) and króna. This meant new stamps, which were issued beginning in August. The same basic design, with some changes of color and perforation, continued in use through 1901. In 1897 a shortage of 3-aurar stamps led to the overprinting of 5-aurur stamps with þrir or þrir / 3; these are rare, and unfortunately excellent counterfeits have been produced. In 1902 the numeral stamps were officially withdrawn and declared invalid for postage, since a new set depicting King Christian IX was to be issued. But then the Minister of Iceland changed his mind for reasons which are still unclear and had the numerals reissued, overprinted Í GILDI / '02--'03 in red or black, the overprint indicating that they were still valid. While some of the overprints are common, costing the collector less than one US dollar or one euro, others are among the great rarities of Icelandic philately. There are also many inverts and typographical errors to be found. 25 aurar \\"Í Gildi\\", 1902 In 1906 King Christian died, and so in 1907 a new series of stamps came out, featuring overlapping profiles of Christian IX and King Frederick VIII. 1911 saw Iceland's first commemorative stamps, a set honoring Jón Sigurðsson, the leader of Iceland's independence movement in the 19th century, on the 100th anniversary of his birth. In February of the following year, a set was issued with Frederick's silhouette. Although Frederick died in May 1912, no new stamps were issued until 1915, when another set of the 1907 design was issued in new colors. King Christian X first appeared on Icelandic stamps in a new set of 1920. Periodic stamp shortages plagued the postal service during the 1920s, and locally surcharged stamps were produced in 1921, 1922, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1929, and 1930. The first pictorial, non-portrait stamps were issued in 1925, a set of five showing views of Iceland. Iceland's first airmail stamp was issued in 1928; it was produced by overprinting a crude image of an airplane on a regular 10-aurar stamp. Icelandic 10 Aur stamp from 1930 - The 1000th Anniversary of the AlthingIn 1930, Iceland celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the Althing with an attractive series of 15 regular and 5 airmail stamps featuring a wide variety of historical, mythological, and scenic images. In 1928 Icelandic authorities received a proposal from the 'Society of the Friends of Iceland' Verein der Islandsfreunde in Vienna Austria, proposing to produce these stamps as a gift to Iceland for the Millenary celebrations. Against the advice of the Head Postmaster, Sigurður Briem, the Icelandic government accepted the offer to produce 813,000 kronur's worth of stamps, 600,000 kronur's worth of which were to go to Iceland, and the rest to the Society for its trouble. Iceland's share of the stamps were delivered in December 1929, but in 1930 it became apparent that a fraud had been committed and a much larger than authorised number of stamps had been produced, by the insertion of the figure '1' before the value in the print order. Police investigations had not been completed before the outbreak of World War II, and were not resumed afterwards. In May 1931, stamps were overprinted Zeppelin / 1931 for use on mail sent via the airship Graf Zeppelin, which visited Reykjavík on 1 July. The zeppelin did not actually land, there being no facilities, but it got low enough to pass mail bags up and down. Also in 1931, a new issue came out depicting the Gullfoss waterfall. In addition, stamps of the 1920 issue, but with the vignette of the king much more finely engraved, started appearing periodically, through 1937. Iceland's first semi-postal stamps appeared in 1933. The subjects of the three stamps depicted categories of recipients; rescue workers, children, and the elderly. Hekla eruption of 1947 on Icelandic 25-aurar stamp of 1948 In 1938 a dramatic series featured images of Geysir, the namesake of all other geysers. Iceland again honored Jón Sigurðsson on its issue marking the independent republic established on 17 June 1944 (and again on the 150th anniversary of his birth on 17 June 1961 and the centenary of the deaths of Jón and his wife, Ingibjorg Einarsdóttir, in 1979). In 1948, the eruption of the volcano Hekla was marked by another set of dramatic images. Since independence, Iceland has pursued a relatively restrained stamp-issuing policy, bringing out about 20 new stamps each year. There are annual Christmas and Europa issues, and sets depicting local scenery, flora, and fauna, as well as heritage and the works of local artists. Iceland Post has announced that it will cease issuing stamps after 2020. The postal service plans to continue to sell its stamps in stock to customers and may reprint older stamps if necessary to replenish its stock.

They invested in and successfully promoted a new soap-making process invented by chemist William Hough Watson. Lever Brothers entered the United States market in 1895 and acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall & Sons, in 1925. Lever Brothers was one of several British companies that took an interest in the welfare of its British employees. Its brands included \\"Lifebuoy\\", \\"Lux\\" and \\"Vim\\". Lever Brothers merged with Margarine Unie to form Unilever in 1930.  History  Starting with a small grocery business begun by his father, William Lever (later created, in June 1917, The 1st Baron Leverhulme and, in December 1922, further elevated to being The 1st Viscount Leverhulme) and his brother James entered the soap business in 1885 by buying a small soap works in Warrington. The brothers teamed up with a Cumbrian chemist, William Hough Watson, who became an early business partner. Watson invented the process which resulted in a new soap, using glycerin and vegetable oils such as palm oil, rather than tallow.Jeannifer Filly Sumayku, Unilever: Providing Enjoyable and Meaningful Life to Customers , The President Post, 22 March 2010 The resulting soap was a good, free-lathering soap, at first named Honey Soap then later named \\"Sunlight Soap\\". Production reached 450 tons per week by 1888. Larger premises were built on marshes at Bromborough Pool on the Wirral Peninsula at what became Port Sunlight, then part of Cheshire. Though the company was named Lever Brothers, William Lever's brother and co-director James never took a major part in running the business. He fell ill in 1895, probably as a result of diabetes, and resigned his directorship two years later. Lever Brothers entered the United States market in 1895, with a small New York City sales office. In 1898, it bought a soap manufacturer in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Curtis Davis Company, moved its U.S. headquarters to Cambridge and started production at a factory located at what is now Technology Square. By 1929, Lever Brothers employed 1,000 workers in Cambridge, and 1,400 nationwide, making it the third-largest soap manufacturer in the U.S. In 1925, Lever Brothers acquired Mac Fisheries, owner of T. Wall & Sons. = Employee welfare and use of forced labour = Lever Brothers was one of several British companies that took an interest in the welfare of its British employees. The model village of Port Sunlight, then in Cheshire, was developed between 1888 and 1914 adjoining the soap factory to accommodate the company's staff in good quality housing, with high architectural standards and many community facilities. The paternity found at Port Sunlight did not exist in the operations of its subsidiary in the Belgian Congo, where Lever Brothers, through their subsidiary Huileries du Congo Belge (HCB), utilised forced labour between 1911 and 1945.. First published as Travail forcé pour l'huile de palme de Lord Leverhulme: L'histoire du Congo 1910-1945, tome 3 by Editions Paula Bellings in 2001. =Brands= By 1900 Lifebuoy, Lux and Vim brands had been added and subsidiaries had been set up in the United States, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Germany and elsewhere. By 1911, the company had its own oil palm plantations in the Belgian Congo and the Solomon Islands. Lever Brothers Ltd also acquired other soap companies including A&F; Pears, John Knight of London,Grace's Guide: John Knight Retrieved 1 May 2020 Gossage's of Widnes, Watson's of Leeds, Crosfield's of Warrington, Hazlehurst & Sons of Runcorn and Hudson's of Liverpool. The town of Leverville (the present-day Lusanga) was founded in the then district of Kwango, later part of the Province of Léopoldville, in the western part of the Belgian Congo and was named after William Lever (later Viscount Leverhulme). = Unilever = In September 1929, Unilever was formed by a merger of the operations of Dutch Margarine Unie and British soapmaker Lever Brothers, named as a blend the two firms' names. About us, 1920-1929 , Unilever By 1930, it employed 250,000 people and in terms of market value, was the largest company in Britain. Unilever was the first modern multinational company. The Lever Brothers name was kept for a time as an imprint, as well as the name of the US subsidiary, Lever Brothers Company, and a Canadian subsidiary, Lever Brothers Limited. Lever Brothers was sold to a US capital firm, Pensler Capital Corporation, and renamed Korex in 2008. Korex Don Valley assumed operations of the Lever Brothers Toronto plant. It has since closed and gone bankrupt. The Toronto plant is now being redeveloped into an office and industrial district by First Gulf Corporation.  Presidents  Among its presidents was Charles Luckman who in the 1950s championed the construction of the Lever House in New York City. Luckman left the company before the building's completion, moving on to a notable architectural career, including the design of Madison Square Garden, the Theme Building and master plan for Los Angeles International Airport, the Aon Center, and major buildings at the Kennedy Space Center and Johnson Space Center.

Syfy is available to 92.4 million households in America. History In 1989, in Boca Raton, Florida, communications attorney Mitchell Rubenstein and his wife Laurie Silvers devised the concept for the Sci-Fi Channel. They planned to have it begin broadcasting in December 1990, but they lacked the resources to launch it. In March 1992, the concept was picked up by USA Networks, then a joint venture between Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios. The channel was seen as a natural fit with classic films and television series that both studios had in their vaults, including Universal's Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Rod Serling TV series Night Gallery, along with Paramount's Star Trek. Star Treks creator Gene Roddenberry and author Isaac Asimov were among those on the initial advisory board, but both had died by the time the channel finally launched on September 24, 1992. Rubenstein recalled: \\"The first thing that was on the screen was 'Dedicated to the memories of Isaac Asimov and Gene Roddenberry'.\\" Leonard Nimoy was master of ceremonies at the channel's launch party, held at the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan. Asimov's widow Janet and Roddenberry's widow Majel Barrett were both in attendance. The first program shown on the network was the film Star Wars. In 1994, Paramount was sold to Viacom, followed by Seagram's purchase of a controlling stake in MCA (of which Universal was a subsidiary) from the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company the next year. In 1997, Viacom sold its stake in USA Networks to Universal, who spun off all its television assets to Barry Diller the next year into the new company Studios USA. Three years later, Diller would sell Studios USA back to Universal, by then a subsidiary of Vivendi SA (at the time known as Vivendi Universal). Vivendi's film and television production and cable television assets were then merged with General Electric's NBC to form NBC Universal in 2004. In 2010, Comcast purchased Syfy's parent company NBCUniversal. A high definition version of the channel launched on October 3, 2007 on DirecTV. In 2013, Syfy was given the James Randi Educational Foundation's Pigasus Award for what was described as questionable reality programming involving paranormal subjects. =Branding history= Sci Fi logo, 2002–2009 Syfy logo, 2009–2017 From 1992 to 1999, the network's first logo consisted of a planet with a ring, made to look like Saturn, with \\"SCI-FI CHANNEL\\" written on it. The network's second logo, which was used from 1999 to 2002, dropped the hyphen and the word \\"CHANNEL\\" from the name. The network's third and final \\"ringed planet\\" logo ran from 2002 to 2009, and was designed by Lambie-Nairn. The logo made its debut on December 2, 2002, with the launch of the Steven Spielberg miniseries Taken. The network also launched a new image campaign with the tagline \\"If\\", which expresses the limitless possibilities of the imagination. Identification bumps depicted surreal situations such as a baby breathing fire, as well as a woman in a stately sitting room kissing a bug- eyed, big-eared animal. On March 16, 2009, NBCUniversal announced that Sci Fi was rebranding as \\"Syfy\\". Network officials also noted that, unlike the generic term \\"sci fi\\", which represents the entire genre, the term \\"Syfy\\" as a sensational spelling can be protected by trademark and therefore would be easier to market on other goods or services without fear of confusion with other companies' products. The only significant previous use of the term \\"Syfy\\" in relation to science fiction was by the website SyFy Portal, which became Airlock Alpha after selling the brand to an unnamed company in February 2009. The name change was greeted with initial negativity, with people deliberately mispronouncing \\"Syfy\\" as or to make fun of the name change. The parody news anchor Stephen Colbert made fun of the name change on The Colbert Report by giving the channel a \\"Tip of the Hat\\" for \\"spelling the name the way it's pronounced\\" and noting that \\"the tide is turning in my long fought battle against the insidious 'soft C. The new name took effect on July 7, 2009. Syfy has since added reality shows and edged further from strictly science fiction, fantasy and horror programming.Syfy is Turning Into VH1: More Reality TV and Tracy Morgan, io9, March 18, 2010Syfy Announces New Programming for 2010-2011, The Flick Cast, March 19, 2010Syfy Channel 2010: More Reality, More Games, Inside TV, March 23, 2010 The rebranding efforts at NBC Universal's Sci Fi Channels worldwide resulted in most rebranding as \\"Syfy\\" or \\"Syfy Universal\\"; however, over one-third of the channels did not take on \\"Syfy\\" as any part of their names: channels in Japan and the Philippines rebranded to or were replaced by Universal Channel, while each of the channels in Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia would become Sci Fi Universal. In Polish, \\"Syfy\\" does not suggest imagination or science fiction, but rather syphilis.SCI FI president Dave Howe answers your Syfy questions, Sci Fi Wire, March 20, 2009 In Australia, the Sci Fi channel was a joint venture not solely owned by NBC Universal; the channel was uniquely rebranded as \\"SF\\" until its closure, and was replaced by an NBC Universal solely-owned version of Syfy, branded as such, matching the standard international \\"Syfy\\" branding tv. On May 11, 2017, in honor of the network's upcoming 25th anniversary, Syfy unveiled a major rebranding that took effect on-air June 19. The new branding was intended to re-position the channel back towards targeting fans of the fantasy and sci-fi genres. Network head Chris McCumber explained that the network's goal was to \\"put fans at the center of everything we do\\", and explained a stacked, square- shaped form of the logo as being akin to a \\"badge\\". Syfy also planned to place a larger focus on its genre news division Syfy Wire, disclosing the possibility of extending the website to television as well. Programming Syfy's programming includes original made-for-cable movies, miniseries, and series. In the past, the channel concentrated on classic science fiction shows. However, under NBCUniversal ownership, the channel has altered its programming to target more mainstream audiences. In 2006, it began airing programs outside of the sci-fi genre such as Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and WCG Ultimate Gamer. As part of this shift, Syfy previously aired professional wrestling programming from WWE, including ECW, NXT, and SmackDown.\\"SmackDown\\" Goes Syfy, World Wrestling Entertainment, April 13, 2010 The network had gained significant international attention for its successful original miniseries and subsequent four-season series Battlestar Galactica. In addition to many awards,List of awards and nominations received by Battlestar Galactica the United Nations invited the main cast to a retrospective and discussion. Also prominent was the network's airing of Taken, which won the Emmy Award that year for best miniseries. =Animation= Syfy began airing Japanese anime films and original video animations in the early 1990s. It was the first to show the Streamline Pictures English dubs of the films Robot Carnival, Lensman and Akira, as well as airing Central Park Media's Dominion: Tank Police, Gall Force, and Project A-ko. After a break in airings, anime programming returned on June 11, 2007, with a weekly two-hour programming block called \\"Ani-Monday\\". Intended to directly compete with Adult Swim's Adult Swim Action branding, the block featured English dubs of various anime series licensed by Manga Entertainment. During February 2008, the channel also aired anime on Tuesday nights in a second programming block. In July 2009, Syfy announced that they had renewed and expanded their licensing agreement with Manga Entertainment to continue \\"Ani-Mondays\\", as well as to add a similar two-hour block of horror anime (also called \\"Ani-Monday\\") to its sister channel Chiller. Syfy's anime block was later moved to Thursday nights, starting March 14, 2011, where it remained until all anime programming was abruptly removed from the schedule on June 9, 2011. On April 20, 2019, Syfy launched TZGZ, a late night adult animation block anchored by reruns of Futurama. =Syfy original films= Spearheaded and originally launched by Thomas Vitale in 2001, and managed by Vitale, Chris Regina, and Ray Cannella, with the later additions of Karen O'Hara and Macy Lao, Sci Fi Pictures original films are typically independently-made B-movies with production budgets of $1 million to $2 million each. These films usually premiere on Saturday nights. They are also one of the sponsors for the Coalition for Freedom of Information. The movies have become one of the longest-lasting vestiges of Syfy's schedule. One of the most memorable campaigns for the movies presented these films as part of \\"The Most Dangerous Night of Television\\" (Saturdays). Over the years, Syfy's promotion of the movies leans into the escapist fun promised by them, with titles such as Sharktopus, Malibu Shark Attack, Mansquito, Two-Headed Shark Attack, Ogre, Ice Twisters, Star Runners and Sharknado. Since 2001, Syfy has worked with a number of different production companies (most of them independent) to make over 200 original movies of this type. Media =Websites= SciFi.com and Syfy.com Syfy's website launched in 1995, at SciFi.com, under the name \\"The Dominion\\"; it dropped the name in 2000. The site has won a Webby Award and a Flash Forward Award. From 2000 to 2005, SciFi.com published original science fiction short stories in a section called \\"Sci Fiction\\", edited by Ellen Datlow, who won a 2005 Hugo Award for her work there. The stories themselves won a World Fantasy Award, the first Theodore Sturgeon Award for online fiction (for Lucius Shepard's novella \\"Over Yonder\\"), and four of the Science Fiction Writers of America's Nebula Awards, including the first for original online fiction (for Linda Nagata's novella \\"Goddesses\\"). On April 22, 2006, the site launched Sci Fi Pedia, a commercial wiki on topics including anime, comics, fandom, fantasy, games, horror, science fiction, and toys, UFOs, genre-related art and audio, and the paranormal. In 2009, Sci Fi Pedia was shut down without explanation. As part of the channel's rebranding in 2009, the URL was changed to Syfy.com. As of 2010, Syfy.com began to contain webisode series including Riese: Kingdom Falling (as of October 26, 2010), The Mercury Men (as of July 25, 2011), and Nuclear Family (as of October 15, 2012). Syfy.com was redesigned in early 2015, allowing users to watch the live channel on the site, as well as episodes of most current programming. The website was once again redesigned and combined with SyfyWire.com on June 19, 2017, in alliance with Syfy's rebranding. SyfyGames SyfyGames.com is an online games portal which offers free-to-play MMO and casual games. The site features predominantly sci-fi and fantasy games from third-party developers.Home for free to play sci-fi and fantasy games In April 2015, the News section of SyfyGames.com was rebranded to feature \\"news from G4\\" to prevent trademark dilution of Syfy's defunct sister gaming-focused network. In 2010, Syfy Games signed a deal with defunct publisher THQ to co-produce De Blob 2. Syfy Games would also co-produce Red Faction: Armageddon. Syfy Wire Syfy Wire (formerly Sci-Fi Wire and Blastr) is a website operated by Syfy featuring coverage of news in the science fiction, horror, and fantasy genres. The site was rebranded in 2010 as Blastr, with the addition of feature articles, guest columnists (such as Phil Plait), popular science news and coverage, and video content. In December 2016, Blastr rebranded as Syfy Wire; editor-in-chief Adam Swiderski stated that this change was to closer associate the website with the Syfy television channel.

In the 2011 census the civil parish—which includes the small settlement of Stalbridge Weston to the southwest—had 1,160 households and a population of 2,698. The nearest towns are Sturminster Newton, south east, Sherborne, west, and Shaftesbury, north east. Stalbridge is situated on the A357 on a low limestone ridge, one mile west of the River Stour. It officially became a town in April 1992.Stalbridge Town Council, 2005. Introduction. Accessed 2005-12-30. Though relatively small, Stalbridge has its own independent supermarket, dispensing pharmacy, dentist and optician, as well as many other services, reflecting its catchment area of surrounding farms and hamlets. It is also home to the local free newspaper, the Blackmore Vale Magazine. History Thatched cottage at Stalbridge There was a settlement near Stalbridge in Roman times. The town has a 15th-century church with a 19th-century tower, dedicated to Saint Mary and restored to designs by T. H. Wyatt,Michael Pitt-Rivers, 1966. Dorset. London: Faber & Faber. in 1878, which overlooks the town from a hill. The town has had market rights since the time of King George I, though it has not held a regular market for many years. In the town centre stands a 10-metre (30 ft) tall market cross, said to be the finest in the country.The Dorset Page, \\"Stalbridge.\\" Stalbridge was home to scientist Robert Boyle (see below), and writer Douglas Adams, who wrote much of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in the town. The town also boasts that it is home to the oldest living male twins in the world. Artist Sir James Thornhill lived just south of the town, in Thornhill Park, which he bought in 1725. The house is believed to have been originally owned by Sir Walter Raleigh in the 16th century. In 1727, Sir James Thornhill erected an obelisk in the park to honour the accession of King George II. From September 1863 Stalbridge was served by Stalbridge railway station on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, with trains to Bath and Bournemouth. During World War II a Ministry of Food depot was situated here. The last train ran on 7 March 1966, and most of the tracks, station and goods yard have been replaced, though tracks still cross the road.Mike Oakley, 2001. Dorset Railway Stations. Wimborne: Dovecote Press = Stalbridge House = In 1618 Mervyn Tucher (or Audley), 2nd Earl of Castlehaven, who had inherited Stalbridge Park from his father, decided to build a mansion house on his Stalbridge estate. He enclosed an area used as common land to the northwest of the church, moving tenant farmers out, and built a Jacobean style mansion, the fifth largest house in Dorset. In 1631 the earl's eldest son James brought a case against him for \\"unnatural practices\\", and he was subsequently executed. James sold the house to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork. After his father's death, the scientist Robert Boyle became Lord of the Manor, and the house was his residence between 1644 and 1652. It was here that he conducted many of his experiments. At some point during the house's history a high stone wall was built around the boundary of Stalbridge Park. There is some argument as to when and why the wall was built. It may have been commissioned by Castlehaven as a status symbol, work for French prisoners of the Napoleonic Wars, or as work for local labourers in times of high unemployment. By 1822 the house was in poor repair and the current owner, the Marquess of Anglesey, had it demolished.Denys Kay-Robinson, 1984. The Landscape of Thomas Hardy. Exeter, Webb & Bower By 1827 all that remained was the raised area where it had stood. The stone was sold off and much of it is in use elsewhere in the town, including the large farm house which now stands in the park. There are many popular local myths and ghost stories about the demise of the house, mostly involving a fire destroying the house. Stalbridge Park features in Thomas Hardy's Wessex as \\"Stapleford Park\\". Governance Stalbridge is the major part of Blackmore electoral ward. The ward also includes Stourton Caundle and south to the Lydlinch area. The ward population at the 2011 census was 3,574. Stalbridge is part of the North Dorset parliamentary constituency.  Demographics  The town of Stalbridge had a population of 2,396 as of the 2011 census. There were 1,151 males and 1,210 females. The population includes 365 children under the age of 18, 1,167 people between the ages of 18 and 64, leaving 829 people aged 65 and over. The town is 98.5% white, with 0.7% of the population being Asian, and 0.3% Black. Religiously, the town is largely Christian, with Christians constituting 79.8% of the population. Another 19.4% are not religious, with 0.5% being Buddhist, corresponding to 11 people. There are also 2 Muslims and 1 Jew in the town, according to 2011 figures. Geography Stalbridge lies in the Blackmore Vale. As an area of hills, this means that the town lies largely on a gradient. The high street through the town centre follows the contour of the landscape, before climbing up Church Hill past the parish church of St. Mary, heading towards the Somerset border and Henstridge. To the east of the high street, Station Road heads down the hill, heading towards the Stalbridge trading estates, passing the modern housing estates built in the 1970s.https://www.dorsetforyou.gov.uk/media/163796/Stalbridge- Part-5.2-and-5.4-Eighteenth-nineteenth-and-twentieth-century- February-2011/pdf/Stalbridge_Part_5.2_and_5.4_Eighteenth_nineteenth_and_twentieth_century_February_2011.pdf To the West, the town climbs Barrow Hill, with older housing, some estates dating to the 1950s, and the 1990s Pond Walk. There are two parks in Stalbridge, the larger of which is situated on Barrow hill, and hosts a football field and a cricket pitch, as well as two tennis courts. This park also has an outdoor playset. The smaller park functions largely as an outdoor playset, with two slides, a small football pitch and other toys. There are several footpaths and bridleways in Stalbridge. A trailway follows the route of the disused Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. It passes through the Stalbridge Nature Reserve, and has a hard pack surface suitable for cycles, including hybrid bicycles, or even endurance road bicycles.  Sports  The town has a football club, a cricket club, and a tennis club.

(, ) ( – 28 April 1076) was King of Denmark from 1047 until his death in 1076. He was the son of Ulf Thorgilsson and Estrid Svendsdatter, and the grandson of King Sweyn I Forkbeard through his mother's line. He was married three times, and fathered 20 children or more out of wedlock, including the five future kings Harald III Hen, Canute IV the Saint, Oluf I Hunger, Eric I Evergood, and Niels. He was courageous in battle, but did not have much success as a military commander. His skeleton reveals that he was a tall, powerfully built man who walked with a limp. Biography =Accession to the throne= Sweyn was born in England,Bricka, Carl Frederik, Dansk Biografisk Lexikon, vol. XVII [Svend Tveskjæg – Tøxen], 1903, pp.3–5. as the son of Ulf Thorgilsson and Estrid Svendsdatter, the latter of whom was the daughter of King Sweyn I Forkbeard and sister of Kings Harald II and Canute the Great. Sweyn grew up a military leader, and served under king Anund Jacob of Sweden for a time. He pillaged the Elbe-Weser area in 1040, but was caught by the Archbishop of Hamburg- Bremen, who released him shortly thereafter.Stefan Pajung, Artikel: Svend Estridsen ca. 1019-1074/76, danmarkshistorien.dk, Aarhus University, January 19, 2010 Svend was made a jarl under Danish king Harthacnut (the two were first cousins), and led a campaign for him against Norway, but was beaten by Magnus I of Norway. When Harthacnut died in 1042, Magnus claimed the Danish throne and made Svend the jarl of Jutland.Louise Kæmpe Henriksen, Historiske Personer – Svend Estridsen – konge af Danmark 1047–74., vikingeskibsmuseet.dk In 1043, Sweyn fought for Magnus at the Battle of Lyrskov Heath at Hedeby, near the present-day border of Denmark and Germany. Sweyn won a great reputation at Lyrskov Heath, and had the Danish nobles crown him king in Viborg in Jutland. He was defeated by Magnus on several occasions, and had to flee to Sweden. Eventually he managed to return and establish a foothold in Scania. The war between Magnus and Sweyn lasted until 1045, when Magnus' uncle Harald Hardrada returned to Norway from exile. Harald and Sweyn joined forces, and Magnus decided to share the Norwegian throne with Harald. In 1047 Magnus died, having stated on his deathbed that his kingdom would be divided: Harald would get the throne of Norway, while Sweyn would be king of Denmark. Upon hearing of Magnus' death Sweyn said, \\"Now so help me God, I shall never yield Denmark\\".Huitfeldt, Arild. Danmarks Riges Krønike =Feud with Harald Hardrada= Harald, unwilling to relinquish Denmark, attacked Sweyn and fought a long war. Harald sacked Hedeby in 1050, and also sacked Aarhus. Sweyn almost captured Harald in 1050, when Harald attacked the coast of Jutland and loaded his ships with goods and captives. Sweyn's flotilla caught up with the Norwegians and Harald ordered his men to throw out the captured goods, thinking the Danes would stop to get the goods. Sweyn ordered his men to leave the goods and go after Harald. Harald then ordered his men to throw the captives overboard. For them Sweyn was willing to let Harald slip away. Sweyn came close to losing his life at the naval Battle of Niså off the coast of Halland in 1062. According to the sagas Harald urged Sweyn to meet him in a final and decisive battle at Elv in the spring of 1062.http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/hardrade2.html, p.61 When Sweyn and the Danish army did not show up, Harald sent home a large part of his army, only keeping the more professional warriors in his fleet. When Sweyn finally came to meet Harald, his fleet numbered 300 ships to Harald's 150.http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/hardrade2.html, p.63 The fleets met at night and the battle lasted until morning, when the Danes started to flee. In the sagas the Norwegian victory is largely credited to earl Haakon Ivarsson, who disengaged his ships from the Norwegian flanks and started attacking the weakened ships on the Danish flanks.http://mcllibrary.org/Heimskringla/hardrade2.html, p.65 This might be the aiding Norwegian chieftain that Saxo Grammaticus refers to, as turning the tide in Norwegian favour.http://www.jomsborg.eu/Saxobog11.pdf Sweyn managed to escape the battle, reached land and stopped at the house of a peasant to ask for something to eat. \\"What was the terrible rumbling in the night?\\" she asked. \\"Didn't you know the two kings were fighting all night?\\" asked one of Sweyn's men. \\"Who won, then?\\" the woman asked. \\"Norwegians,\\" came the reply. \\"It's a shame on us, for a king we already have. He limps and is timid.\\" \\"No,\\" King Sweyn explained, \\"Timid the king of the Danes is assuredly not,\\" defended another of the king's men, \\"but luck isn't with him and he lacks a victory.\\" The housecarl brought the men water and a towel to wash themselves. As the king was drying his hands, the woman tore the cloth from him, \\"You should be ashamed of yourself for using the whole towel for yourself,\\" she scolded. \\"The day will come when I will have your permission to use the whole cloth,\\" was the king's comment. Her husband gave the king a horse and Sweyn continued on his way to Zealand. Some time later the peasant was called to Zealand and given lands there for his service to the king, but his wife had to remain behind in Halland. Sweyn had a reputation for generosity and kindness that helped him on several occasions to win the trust of his people. Harald relinquished his claims to Denmark in 1064, in exchange for Sweyn's recognition of Harald as Harald III of Norway. Harald then sailed off to England to claim the crown of England, and was killed there. =Consolidation of power= Coin of Sweyn II. Mildenhall, Suffolk. British Museum. Coin of Sven Estridson. British Museum. Sweyn's connection to the Danish line of succession was his mother Estrid Svendsdatter, and he took the matronymic surname Estridsson after her, emphasizing his link to the Danish royalty. He also minted his own coins. Sweyn sought to consolidate his power through links to the church as well as foreign powers, and actively sought the friendship of the Popes. He wanted his eldest son Knud Magnus crowned by the Pope, but Knud died on the journey to Rome. He also unsuccessfully pressed for Harald Bluetooth, the first Christian king of Denmark, to be sanctified. He was an ally of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor against Baldwin V of Flanders in 1049, and Sweyn assisted his son-in-law Gottschalk in the Liutizi Civil War of 1057. After Harald Hardrada was killed, and William the Conqueror had conquered England, Sweyn turned his attention to England, once ruled by his uncle Canute the Great. He joined forces with Edgar Atheling, the last remaining heir of the Anglo-Saxon royal house, and sent a force to attack king William in 1069. However, after capturing York, Sweyn accepted a payment from William to desert Edgar, who then returned into exile in Scotland. Sweyn failed another attempt in 1074/1075. =Relationship with the church= Sweyn feared that Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg would fill the upper ranks of Denmark's churches with Germans, so he brought Anglo-Danes over from England to keep the Danish church independent. Under the influence of Sweyn, Denmark was divided into eight dioceses around 1060.Diocese of Lund, Diocese of Odense, Diocese of Ribe, Diocese of Roskilde, Diocese of Schleswig, Diocese of Viborg, Diocese of Vestervig, and Diocese of Aarhus. He set the dioceses up by donating large tracts of land, with the Diocese of Roskilde being the highest favoured one, as he had a good relationship with Bishop Vilhelm of Roskilde. When Archbishop Adalbert died in 1072, Sweyn was able to deal directly with the Holy See. He brought scholars to Denmark to teach him and his people Latin so they could converse with the rest of Europe on equal terms. Adam of Bremen travelled to meet this learned king and came away with greater respect for the king's patience and wisdom. Sweyn encouraged the building of churches all over Denmark, and Adam of Bremen was astounded that there were 300 churches in Scania alone, more than in all the other countries of the north put together. Sweyn could be ruthless. One New Year's Eve it was reported to the king that several of his guests and hired men had ridiculed him and talked behind his back. The king was so angry that he had them murdered in the church on New Year's Day. When the king arrived at Roskilde Cathedral for mass, his friend Bishop Vilhelm met him at the door and forbade the king and his party to enter. \\"You stand condemned before God, a murderer, who has defiled the house of God with blood!\\" cried the bishop and pushed the king back with his shepherd's crook. He declared the king excommunicated from the church. The king's men drew their swords and stepped forward to hack the bishop down, but Bishop Vilhelm held his ground. \\"Let him be,\\" shouted the king and withdrew to his farm. There he removed his New Year's fine clothing and weapons and dressed in sackcloth. Then he walked back to the cathedral in his bare feet and cast himself face down in front of the entrance. Bishop Vilhelm had just begun the mass when he was told the king lay humbled at the door. Bishop Vilhelm stopped the service and went to the door to hear the king's abject confession. When the bishop realized the king was truly repentant, he raised him up, lifted the excommunication and led him into the cathedral. =Death= King Sweyn died at the royal estate Søderup, west of Åbenrå at the Little Belt strait. The Danish chronicles inaccurately date his death to 1074, but it is known that he received and answered letters in 1075 and died in 1076. The king's body was carried to Roskilde Cathedral where he was interred in a pillar of the choir next to the remains of Bishop Vilhelm (who was the actual person who died in 1074). Later he was called the \\"father of kings\\" because five of his fifteen sons became kings of Denmark. He was the last Viking ruler of Denmark and an ancestor of all subsequent Danish kings.iGenea – DNA profiles and haplogroups of famous persons: Sven II Estridsen – the last Viking King, accessed July 2018. The remains of other Danish kings are also entombed in Roskilde Cathedral. According to the saga, Sweyn's mother was entombed inside a pillar across from the chapel. However, analysis of mitochondrial DNA proved that this person was not the king's mother, as his mtDNA indicated Haplogroup H, HVR1 7028C. Legacy One of the legacies of King Sweyn was a fundamental change in Danish society which had been based on whether a person was free or a bondsman. Sweyn is often considered to be Denmark's last Viking king as well as the first medieval one. A strengthened church in alliance with the land-owning noble families begin to pit their power against the royal family. The peasants were left to fend for themselves.Danmarks Historie II perbenny.dk Sweyn built a strong foundation for royal power through cooperation with the church. He completed the final partition of Denmark into dioceses by corresponding directly with the pope, bypassing the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen. During his reign hundreds of small wooden churches were built throughout the kingdom; many were rebuilt in stone in the 12th century. Sweyn sought to create a Nordic Archbishopric under Danish rule, a feat which his son Eric I accomplished. Sweyn seems to have been able to read and write, and was described as an especially educated monarch by his personal friend Pope Gregory VII. He is the source of much of our current knowledge about Denmark and Sweden in the 9th and 10th centuries, having told the story of his ancestry to historian Adam of Bremen around 1070. Family Sweyn's first marriage was to Gyda of Sweden, daughter of king Anund Jacob of Sweden. His second marriage, in 1050, was to Gunnhildr Sveinsdóttir, the stepmother of Gyda. The Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen ordered that the union be dissolved, which was effectuated by Pope Leo IX.Svend 2. Estridsen at Gyldendal Åbne Encyklopædi After Harald Hardrada's death, Sweyn married his widow Tora Torbergsdatter. He took one mistress after another during his life. Sweyn fathered at least 20 children, of whom only one was born in wedlock.

Rozelle served as the commissioner of the National Football League (NFL) for nearly thirty years, from January 1960 until his retirement in November 1989. He is credited with making the NFL into one of the most successful sports leagues in the world. During his tenure, Rozelle saw the NFL grow from 12 teams to 28, oversaw the creation of large television-rights deals and the creation of Monday Night Football in 1970, oversaw the 1970 NFL-AFL merger and the creation of the Super Bowl, and helped the NFL move from a twelve-game schedule to its current sixteen-game schedule. By the time of his retirement, many people considered him the most powerful commissioner in sports. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985. Early life Born in South Gate, California, Rozelle grew up in neighboring Lynwood during the Great Depression. He graduated from Compton High School in 1944, with Duke Snider, lettering in tennis and basketball. He was drafted into the U.S. Navy in 1944 and served 18 months in the Pacific on an oil tanker. Rozelle entered Compton Community College in 1946. While there he worked as the student athletic news director and also worked part-time for the Los Angeles Rams as a public relations assistant. Pete Newell, head coach for the University of San Francisco Dons basketball team, came to Compton in 1948 for a recruiting visit. Impressed by Rozelle, Newell helped arrange for him to get a full scholarship to work in a similar capacity at USF. Rozelle enrolled at USF that year and worked as a student publicist for the USF Dons athletic department. In addition to promoting the school's football team he was able to draw national attention to the Dons' 1949 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) championship basketball team. After graduating from USF in 1950 he was hired by the school as the full-time athletic news director.http://foghorn.usfca.edu/2012/02/pete-rozelle-from-usf-student- publicist-to-father-of-the-super-bowl-and-beyond/ In 1952, he re-joined the Rams as a PR specialist. Leaving after three years, he held a series of public relations jobs in southern California, including marketing the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia for a Los Angeles based company. In 1957, he returned to the Rams, a disorganized, unprofitable team, lost in the growing L.A. market, as their general manager. In spite of continued struggles on the field, including a league-worst 2–10 record in 1959, he turned them into a business success in just three years. NFL commissioner =1960s= After Bert Bell's death in October , the 33-year-old Rozelle was the surprise choice for his replacement as NFL commissioner. According to Howard Cosell in his book I Never Played the Game, the owners took 23 ballots before settling on Rozelle as NFL Commissioner at a January 26, 1960 meeting. When he took office following the season, there were twelve teams in the NFL playing a twelve-game schedule to frequently half-empty stadiums, and only a few teams had television contracts. The NFL in was following a business model that had evolved from the 1930s. One of Rozelle's early accomplishments was helping the league adopt profit-sharing of gate and television revenues. The revenue- sharing was a major factor in stabilizing the NFL and guaranteeing the success of its small-market teams. Another important contribution was Rozelle's success in negotiating large television contracts to broadcast every NFL game played each season. In doing so, he deftly played one television network against the other. In early 1962, Rozelle was re-elected to a five-year contract to remain as commissioner, with a salary continuing at $50,000 per year. Less than five months later, he was granted a $10,000 bonus (for ) and his annual salary was increased by $10,000 to $60,000. JFK assassination After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, Rozelle wrestled with the decision of whether to cancel that Sunday's games. Rozelle and White House press secretary Pierre Salinger had been classmates at the University of San Francisco, so Rozelle consulted with him. Salinger urged Rozelle to play the games, so he agreed for the schedule to proceed. Rozelle felt that way, saying: \\"It has been traditional in sports for athletes to perform in times of great personal tragedy. Football was Mr. Kennedy's game. He thrived on competition.\\" After their win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia, players on the Washington Redskins asked Coach Bill McPeak to send the game ball to the White House, thanking Rozelle for allowing the games to be played that weekend, saying that they were \\"playing...for President Kennedy and in his memory.\\" There were players and news outlets that disagreed with the decision, and Rozelle subsequently thought it might have been wiser to cancel those games. The American Football League (AFL) and most major colleges did not play games that weekend. Citing his \\"aptitude for conciliation\\" with the league's owners, his work in expanding the NFL, and his crackdown on player gambling, Sports Illustrated named Rozelle their \\"Sportsman of the Year\\" for 1963. The AFL By , the rival American Football League obtained a new NBC-TV contract and had signed a new superstar in Joe Namath. As the leagues battled to sign top talent, bonuses and salaries grew dramatically, especially after a series of \\"raids\\" on each other's talent, both signed and unsigned. The leagues agreed to a merger in 1966. Among the conditions were a common draft and a championship game played between the two league champions first played in early 1967, the AFL-NFL World Championship Game, which would eventually become known as the Super Bowl. Rozelle led negotiations with AFL and NFL executives to merge the two leagues. In October 1966, he testified in front of Congress and convinced them to allow the merger. Rozelle played an important role in making the Super Bowl the most watched sporting event in the United States. Due to television contracts, the AFL and NFL operated as separate leagues until 1970, with separate regular season schedules, but they met in the preseason and in the championship game. Although Rozelle nominally remained the NFL commissioner, he was given broad authority over both leagues after AFL Commissioner Al Davis was forced to resign and ultimately replaced by an AFL President subordinate to the NFL Commissioner. During this time, the NFL Commissioner's office came to resemble that of the Commissioner of Baseball and Rozelle unofficially became known as the Football Commissioner although that was never an official title. Meanwhile, the AFL expanded, adding the Miami Dolphins in 1966, and the Cincinnati Bengals in 1967. Also during this period, the NFL added the Atlanta Falcons in 1966, and the New Orleans Saints in 1967. In 1970, the AFL was absorbed into the NFL and the league reorganized with the ten AFL franchises along with the previous NFL teams Baltimore Colts, Cleveland Browns, and Pittsburgh Steelers becoming part of the newly-formed American Football Conference (AFC), with all of the remaining pre-merger NFL teams forming the National Football Conference (NFC). By 1970, the newly-reconstituted NFL stood at 26 teams. =1970s= In 1970, Rozelle proposed his concept, Monday Night Football, to Roone Arledge, then the head of the ABC television network. After selling his idea to ABC, Monday Night Football premiered in September 1970 with the Cleveland Browns against the New York Jets; the Browns won the game, 31-21. The program is still broadcast today. Monday Night Football aired on ABC for 36 seasons (1970-2005). Except for the 1998 season in which games aired at 8:20 p.m. Eastern Time, games aired at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The first broadcast announcing team was Don Meredith, Howard Cosell, and Keith Jackson.. In 2006, Monday Night Football was moved to sister network ESPN. The NFL expanded by two more teams in 1976, with the addition of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks; this brought the league to 28 teams, which would stand as such for the rest of Rozelle's tenure as commissioner. =1980s= In the 1980s, Al Davis, owner of the Oakland Raiders franchise, sued the NFL in order to relocate the team to Los Angeles. Rozelle represented the NFL, testifying in court to block the Raiders' move. Ultimately, the NFL lost its court case with Davis, and the Oakland franchise moved to Los Angeles in 1982. The tension between Rozelle and Davis, who had wanted to be NFL commissioner, was apparent throughout the case. In January 1981, just after the case was settled, the Oakland Raiders won Super Bowl XV and Rozelle as commissioner was tasked with handing the Super Bowl Trophy to Davis. The Raiders moved back to Oakland in 1995. =Influence= Under Rozelle the NFL thrived and became an American institution, despite two players' strikes and two different competing leagues. He retired as commissioner on November 5, . By the time of his resignation, the number of teams in the league had grown to 28, and team owners presided over sizable revenues from U.S. broadcasting networks. Rozelle's legacy of equalization has been felt not only in the NFL, but also in the Australian Football League, the major Australian-rules football competition. In 1986, The AFL Commission adopted a policy of equalization based on the method pioneered by Rozelle in the NFL. It is because of this decision that expansion clubs have been able to survive, as well as older clubs with smaller support bases. An example of this is the 1996 AFL Grand Final between North Melbourne and the Sydney Swans, two teams with small supporter bases.AFL Football Record, April 18–20, 1997 =Honors= Rozelle was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985 while still serving as its commissioner. The NFL's annual Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award was established in 1989 to recognize \\"longtime exceptional contributions to radio and television in professional football\\", and is awarded annually by the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 1990, the league instituted the Pete Rozelle Trophy to honor the Super Bowl MVP, first awarded in the season at Super Bowl XXV on January 27, 1991. A month after Rozelle's death in December 1996, the NFL honored his legacy with a decal on the back of the helmets of the teams competing in Super Bowl XXXI. In 1990, Rozelle received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1991, Rozelle was honored with the \\"Lombardi Award of Excellence\\" from the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation. For his contribution to sports in Los Angeles, Rozelle was honored by Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum commissioners with a \\"Court of Honor\\" plaque at the Coliseum. Personal life and death Rozelle married Jane Coupe, an artist, in 1949. The couple had one child, Anne Marie, born in 1958. Rozelle was awarded full custody of Anne Marie after his 1972 divorce due to Coupe's alcoholism. Rozelle remarried in December 1973 to Carrie Cooke, a former daughter-in-law of Jack Kent Cooke, owner of the Washington Redskins. In 1996, seven years after his retirement in 1989, Rozelle died of brain cancer at the age of 70 at Rancho Santa Fe, California, and was interred at El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego.Rozelle: a biography See also *List of notable brain tumor patients References Further reading  External links * * Category:1926 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Los Angeles Rams executives Category:National Football League general managers Category:National Football League commissioners Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:University of San Francisco alumni Category:San Francisco Dons football Category:El Camino College Compton Center alumni Category:People from Lynwood, California Category:People from South Gate, California Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Deaths from brain tumor Category:Compton High School alumni ","title":"Pete Rozelle"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},B={class:"card-container"};function H(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),n(l,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your library🥳")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",B,[(t(!0),n(l,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(I,[["render",H]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/13.md","filePath":"people/13.md"}'),R={name:"people/13.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{x as __pageData,L as default};
