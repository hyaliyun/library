Human Rights Watch Two Years With No Moon: Immigration Detention of Children in Thailand Many live in poor hygiene with outdated facilities, without access to adequate health care and legal support. Children are detained in overcrowded cells, frequently separated from family members, without access to education, nutrition and privacy. A 2016 report by the BBC showed that children were suffering from vomiting and diarrhea due to unclean water. \\"The Christians stranded in Thailand: Entire families flee Pakistan and head to Thailand\\" Basic services such as education, recreational activities, medical examination and adequate food are only available in Ministry of Social Development and Human Security (MSDHS) shelters however many choose not to be separated from their children by sending them to shelters and consent to keep their children with them in IDCs.

Children are often detained without regard to protection required by their status as minors and often separated from their parents with unrelated adults, giving them greater risk of violation and abuse, including sexual abuse. Human Rights Watch Two Years With No Moon: Immigration Detention of Children in Thailand Current initiatives aimed at removing children from IDCs are limited and often discretionary. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has denied that detention of migrant children was result of the Government's policies but rather the preference of migrant parents themselves to keep family unity and logistical difficulties. Human Rights Watch Thailand: Migrant Children Locked Up The Thai Government has also claimed that it has allocated over US$14.58 million to improve IDCs to enhance living conditions and has an order by the Thailand Immigration Bureau guaranteeing individual's rights to sanitation, food, health and respect for religious belief.

In 2017, The Guardian reported this environment can create developmental delays and for some children to self-harm. Hannah Summers \\"Child refugees held in 'harrowing' conditions across south-east Asia\\" The Guardian (June 2017). Mental health has been identified as a major concern for detainees and there are few opportunities for referral for treatment.  Lack of access to education  Under Thailand's National Education Act 1999, National Education Act B.E 2542 (1999) all children have the right to primary education regardless of their nationality or legal status. However children detained in IDCs cannot physically access schools to receive such services. According to a 2012 Human Rights Watch report, Thailand's Immigration Office permitted the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to operate a daycare centre for children under 14 years inside Suan Plu IDC. However it was reported that daycare programme does not offer proper education suitable for their age and as a result many have suffered problems such as insomnia, nightmares, bed-wetting, isolation development, attachment disorder and acts of violence.

The proposed treaty will seek to remedy the fragmented human rights structure for Older Persons, and will focus on reaffirming critical human rights which are of concern to the Elderly. The focus of the treaty will be persons over 60 years of age, which is a growing demographic worldwide due to increased population ageing. The treaty follows from the success of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which has seen near universal acceptance since 1989. Where the UNCRC focuses on the rights of younger persons, the UNCROP will address those who form the older portion of society, who according to United Nations reports, are becoming increasingly vulnerable as a group without applicable normative standards of human rights law. Support for a Convention is becoming increasingly popular, as human rights groups including the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), HelpAge International, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the International Labour Organization, and many other NGOs and states have expressed support for a universal instrument. The need for a treaty has arisen due to issues surrounding demographic changes from population ageing. This has led to significant interest in how to best ensure the well being of older persons. Among the rights issues faced by older persons are their rights against ageist discrimination, and the rights to participation. The debate surrounding the convention focuses on the implementation and safeguarding of these rights, to set normative standards of human rights for older persons. One substantive issue is the conception of elder abuse as between individuals. Individual relationships generally fall outside of current human rights law, which seeks to present standards of relations between states and individuals. Therefore, it has been suggested that the proposed human rights convention for older persons ought to be drafted as an anti-discrimination convention.Simon Biggs and Irja Haapala, \\"Elder Mistreatment, Ageism and Human Rights, International Psycho-geriatrics (2013), 25:8, pp. 1299-1306, 1300 However, this would not be consistent with other multilateral human rights conventions such as the ICCPR and ICESCR which set normative standards. Content Presently, no formal draft treaty has been agreed upon by the United Nations General Assembly, though \\"The Open-Ended Working Group on Ageing for the Purpose of Strengthening the Protection of the Human Rights of Older Persons\\" (OEWGA) has debated what the substantive content of a treaty may be. In its most recent session, the OEWGA noted agreed that: \\"it is fundamental to consider older persons as specific right holders and agents of change, and to provide guarantees with respect to the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, in order to allow for their participation in social, economic, cultural, civil and political life, and to seize their experience and potential for contributing to all areas of development.\\" The fundamental rights affirmed by the proposed treaty would be extensions of those secured by other multilateral treaties, though with a focus on specific issues faced by elderly persons. Background =World Assembly on Ageing= In 1982, the Report of the World Assembly on Ageing (also known as \\"the International Plan on Ageing\\") was published, which represented the first international debate on the rights of older persons and presented a plan for their implementation. The Report sets out a number of underlying principles which are applicable to older persons, importantly the participating states reaffirmed \\"their belief that the fundamental and inalienable rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights apply fully and undiminished to the aging.\\" The report acknowledged several sub-topics especially applicable to the rights of elderly persons, including health and nutrition, housing and environment, the family, social welfare, income and security and employment, and education. The report therefore gave policy recommendations to address these concerns, including to avoid imbalances in age groups in the public sector, and to give effort to fill longer life spans with a sense of purpose and accomplishment. Additionally, producing proactive policies aimed at healthier older populations and financial security for retirement were promoted. The significance of this report for the proposed convention is its use in determining the United Nations approach to ageing and its members states' internal policies. =United Nations Principles for Older Persons= The next move towards a convention for the rights of older persons was the adoption of the United Nations Principles for Older Persons, 1991. The Principles provided that older persons in society ought to have independence, the ability to participate in society, have access to care, be entitled to self-fulfilment and the full dignity of life among other rights. The Principles were adopted in October 1992 due to the adoption of the proclamation on aging in General Assembly Resolution 47/5, which contained the proclamation as an annex and giving some weight to the 1991 Principles. However, the implementation of these Principles received little oversight, as under international law United Nations General Assembly Resolutions are not automatically binding on parties.Blaine Sloan, \\"United Nations General Assembly Resolutions in our Changing World\\" (New York 1991) 23 By adopting the Principles, the United Nations brought the rights of older persons to the same moral level as those of other bodies and set some targets towards their implementation, such as the 2001 deadline for meeting global targets on problems for ageing persons. =The Second World Assembly on Ageing= The Second World Assembly saw the adoption of the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, which sought to outline a plan for \\"building a society for all ages.\\" The Plan identified four areas in which states ought to focus to produce a healthier environment for older persons, \\"individual lifelong development, multigenerational relationships, the interrelationship between population ageing and development, and the situation of older persons.\\" The Plan sought to achieve these aims by promoting the active participation of older persons in society in its member states. The contribution of the Plan towards an International Convention on the Rights of Older Persons can be seen in the placement of older people into the general context of international human rights law, establishing the groundwork for older persons to be seen as a protected group. The plan did not specifically refer to older persons as a specific protected group, implying that it was not meant as a declaration of rights, though it did acknowledge the commitment of member states to upholding the rights of all groups and older persons by extension. The plan was set for review after a 10 year period, in which states and NGOs such as the United Nations Population Fund were tasked with implementing the Plan. The Open-Ended Working Group on Ageing for the Purpose of Strengthening the Protection of the Human Rights of Older Persons In October 2010, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 65/182 which established the \\"Open‐Ended Working group on Ageing for the purpose of strengthening the Human Rights of Older Persons\\" as a follow-up to the Madrid Plan. The OEWGA had a mandate to consider the existing international framework of the human rights of older persons and identify possible gaps and how best to address them. The OEWGA forms the primary forum for debate as to the adoption of a multilateral human rights treaty regarding the rights of older persons, as it focuses on the issues faced by older persons and recognizes gaps in the existing human rights framework. The OEWGA has had 8 sessions as of September 2017, and each of these sessions has aimed to clarify issues surrounding older persons rights and provide assistance to members in their obligations under the Madrid Plan. Before each session the OEWGA takes submissions from member states on their contributions towards older persons in society. In the first session select member states acknowledged the difficult position of older person's rights under the traditional international framework, due to the lack of a specific convention. Therefore, debate regarding the necessity of an international convention on the rights of older persons has been a feature of the OEWGA since its outset, which can be seen through the submissions of the member states. Debate and criticism OEWGA has primarily focused on ways to improve the existing human rights framework, though NGOs and states such as Argentina have advocated for a human rights convention, stating in their first submission that: ″There is no legally binding instrument to standardize and protect the rights of older persons... The argument is that the universal nature of international instruments should include the elderly. We all know that this does not happen because we live in an imperfect world. If the world were perfect we would not need any convention, and there is no discrimination. This is why the government of Argentina... support[s] the need for a convention to promote, protect and ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, ensuring its implementation through a binding instrument″ [sic] Argentina's submission drew attention to the legislative significance of Human Rights Conventions, and that adopting such a convention for older persons would be in the best interests of the Madrid Plan.name=\\"auto3\\"> However, multiple states, such as Australia, Denmark and China all noted that domestic policy concerns and demographic differences within their regions allowed for a human rights based approach to the issue, though they disapproved of a multilateral convention. A significant gap in normative standards of older persons rights has been noted by the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which has stated: \\"the establishment of a binding international convention on the rights of older persons would create a legal framework that defined their rights.\\" A similar position was taken by Help-age International, which submitted a substantial report on age discrimination, and concluded that a single instrument was needed to amalgamate the principles of older person's rights into one convention. As a result, the notion of a treaty has received some support as it would set normative standards of human rights for older persons, in order to supplement the Madrid Plan, though it was not universally supported. Non- Government organisations such as HelpAge International have repeatedly referenced a need for \\"universal prohibition of discrimination in old age in a human rights instrument [that] would provide a definitive, universal position that age discrimination is morally and legally unacceptable.\\" The main criticism of a new convention has come from states who have argued that drafting a new convention would be resource intensive, noting that the international human rights framework is already under-resourced. These states argued for a strengthening of existing mechanisms such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as an alternative. This view has been advocated by the United States, which has argued that a new convention would not add anything to the existing protections under international conventions already in existence. However, in the 10 year review of the Madrid Plan on Ageing, according to the United Nations Economic and Social Council: \\"10 years after its adoption, the Madrid Plan of Action has made only limited headway in national and international development plans.\\" Future of the convention Following the 10 year review of the Madrid Plan, Alan Cordina, chair of the sixth session, stated that: \\"I am... aware that an increasing number of delegations and a unanimous and clear voice coming from civil society are requesting us to undertake the task of elaborating a convention. Can we continue turning a deaf ear to those calls? Can we ignore that part of our mandate? My response to both questions is no. A clear no, simple and without ambiguities.\\" The result was a call for a draft convention, which would be presented to the UN General Assembly. This was considered necessary due to the constant breaches of older persons rights taking place worldwide in spite of the existing framework. This was followed in the seventh session with a collaboration with the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to establish some ways in which a multilateral treaty could be established. During the eighth working session, multiple NGOs, and some states came together to discuss the possible text of a draft treaty.

Due to the skewed sex ratio, there is shortage of women in India. The men of higher caste or socioeconomic status are able to marry local women within their community and region. While disadvantaged men, such as those in lower caste groups, the unemployed, poor or those who have disabilities are unable to find brides in their own community and region, resort to buying inter-region brides from the poorer regions.

Other advantages cited are \\"dowry-free, no wedding expenses\\" for bride's poor family, monetary assistance for the bride's family, social stratification of socioeconomically disadvantaged men who are able to find brides, breaking of orthodox social taboos by making inter-caste and inter-religion marriages socially acceptable and \\"widespread\\".

They are then sold as brides to prospective grooms (or their parents)., Kamal Kumar Pandey Female Foeticide, Coerced Marriage & Bonded Labour in Haryana and Punjab: A Situational Report (10 December 2003) at [24]. Parents are also willing to send away their daughters to Haryana (and elsewhere) for marriage in order to alleviate financial burdens associated with conventional marriage in favour of \\"dowry-free, no expenses\\" weddings offered by Haryanvi men. Those trafficked into marriage are bartered at prices based on their physicality such as health, age, beauty and virginity at prices ranging tom 5,000 rupees ($USD70) to 40,000 rupees ($USD600).M Shafiqur Khan \\"Bride Trafficking within India\\" in Veerendra Mishra (ed) Human Trafficking: The Stakeholders’ Perspective (SAGE, India, 2013) 47 at 48. For the bride, marriage often means the end of their rights to bodily autonomy, freedom of movement and access to education, United Nations Population Fund Marrying Too Young: End Child Marriage (2012) at [4]. as traditional gender roles require maintenance of the marital home and caregiving of her in-laws. Due to physical (and mental) underdevelopment of most brides, they are highly susceptible to serious health problems arising in pregnancy as well as childbirth complications. Pregnancy and childbirth related complications constitute the leading cause of death among women aged 15–19 in India and other developing countries., Kamal Kumar Pandey Female Foeticide, Coerced Marriage & Bonded Labour in Haryana and Punjab: A Situational Report (10 December 2003) at [9]. Despite undergoing traditional marriage rituals, trafficked brides struggle to be fully accepted in the community and regularly face discrimination due to the ambiguity regarding their marital status and are deprived of property rights which they would have otherwise been entitled to. Bride shortages have seen re-emergence of fraternal polyandry where one woman is shared with of the husband.Alix Dolson \\"Intergenerational Prostitution in India: How a Cultural Practice Constitutes Sex Trafficking\\" in Margaret Alston (ed) Women, Political Struggles and Gender Equality in South Asia (Pagrave MacMillan, UK, 2014). Karewa (widow remarriage) refers to the practice of marrying off the bride to the brother (or sometimes the father) of a deceased husband.M Shafiqur Khan \\"Bride Trafficking within India\\" in Veerendra Mishra (ed) Human Trafficking: The Stakeholders’ Perspective (SAGE, India, 2013) 47 at 85. Modus operandi of arranging marriages Molki brides are brought to the destination states for the arranged marriage through one of the four methods: molki brides acting as brides acting \\"as marriage mediators\\", husbands of brides who arrange wives relatives as brides for men among their own friends and relatives, marriage brokers or agents, and outright trafficking though \\"trafficking of women for forced marriages ... is not as extensive and rampant\\". In case of trafficked brides, it is difficult to break and punish the trafficking cartels as there is complicity of powerful vested interests in this lucrative trade. Families, victims and others often do not report it to the police, as this widespread \\"practice of buying brides has become socially 'acceptable' solution\\" to the skewed sex trade. Causes =Buying brides= There is severe shortage of women among the socially upper castes like Jats, Rors, Ahirs, Yadavs, and Brahmins, while economically better offs among them can easily find a local bride within their caste, the disadvantaged men among them \\"who are underemployed, poor, those who have little land, suffer from some deformity, are less educated or are old are the ones who most often seek cross-region brides\\". This phenomenon has now spread to lower castes and Muslim communities. In India female foeticide, female infanticide and deliberate neglect of female childrenSonali Mukherjee \\"Skewed Sex Ratio and Migrant Brides in Haryana: Reflections from the Field\\" (2013) 43 Social Change 37 at 38. have resulted in the sex ratio imbalance in the country. Preference for sons stems from centuries old patriarchal traditions which see women as financial burdens where property is passed down the male lineage and dowry expenses are expected to be paid by the bride’s family to the groom upon marriage.Sonali Mukherjee \\"Skewed Sex Ratio and Migrant Brides in Haryana: Reflections from the Field\\" (2013) 43 Social Change 37 at 41. Despite the prevalence of the dowry system across all castes and regions in India,Padma Srinivasan and Gary R Lee \\"The Dowry System in Northern India: Women’s Attitudes and Social Change (2004) 66 Journal of Marriage and Family 1108 at 1109. men who are unable to find brides due to certain socioeconomic disadvantage are willing to pay for a bride from an improvised background.Prem Chowdry \\"Crisis of Masculinity in Haryana: The Unmarried, the Unemployed and the Aged\\" (2005) 40 Economic and Political Weekly 5189 at 5195. =Selling daughters= Wedding gifts for the son of the Imam of Delhi, India, with soldiers and 2000 guests Poverty in the improvised states makes parents vulnerable to sell their daughters for money, some of whom even believe that their daughter is being married to a richer man in a faraway place, are unaware that their daughters are being purchased by the middlemen for reselling in the destination states for a profit. Due to the dowry system in India, the bride's family gives durable goods, cash, and real or movable property to the bridegroom, his parents, or his relatives as a condition of the marriage, stemming from India's skewed inheritance laws, and the Hindu Succession Act needed to be amended to stop the routine disinheritance of daughters.When a feminist turns right , Rediff.com, 2 April 2014. The dowry system can put great financial burden on the bride's family.. Poor families who are unable to afford paying dowry find it hard to get their daughters married, and by selling the daughter they not only avoid paying dowry but also make some money, while disadvantaged men get the bride, it works for both the seller and buyer. Domestic and international laws The Constitution of India prohibits all forms of trafficking under Article 23(1) which states that \\"Traffic in human beings and begar [sic] and other similar forms of forced labour are prohibited and any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in accordance with the law.\\" , Constitution of India 1949 (India), art 23(1). However, India is yet to implement comprehensive laws prohibiting the practice of bride trafficking. Despite the explicit references to trafficking in the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act 1956, it pertains only to commercial sexual activities in brothels and public places., Kamal Kumar Pandey Female Foeticide, Coerced Marriage & Bonded Labour in Haryana and Punjab: A Situational Report (10 December 2003) at [6]. The law conflates prostitution and forced sexual exploitation and fails to distinguish between the victims and perpetrators of the crime. While bride trafficking is not explicitly prohibited in Indian law, it does criminalize many aspects of the practice in statutes. The Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929 provides the legal age of marriage is 21 for males and 18 for females., The Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929 (India), s 2(a). On 11 December 1992, India signed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and has subsequently passed the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000 (replaced by the 2015 Act of the same name). The Act deals with the protection of children who are sexually exploited or are at risk of sexual exploitation., Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015, s 2(14)(ix). However, by limiting the definition of \\"child\\" as \\"a person who has not completed eighteen years of age\\",, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015, s 1(14)(i). the Act covers only some of the victims of sexual exploitation and fails to account for those over the age of 18. India is a party to two human rights conventions which explicitly prohibit forced marriage such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women 1979 (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 (CRC). The government of India has passed domestic legislation in light of its international commitments such as the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006. Article 16(1)(b) of CEDAW states that women have \\"the same right freely to choose a spouse and to enter into marriage only with their free and full consent.\\", Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, article 16(1)(b). By contrast, CRC does not explicitly refer to child marriage but it does have numerous provisions relating to it such. These include article 19 which states that a child has \\"the right to protection from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parents, guardian or any other person\\",, Convention on the Rights of the Child, article 19. and article 34 which provides for \\"the right to protection from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.\\", Convention on the Rights of the Child, article 34. In the latest Concluding observations on India (2014),,Concluding Observations on the Combined Fourth and Fifth Periodic Reports of India. CEDAW, in respect of trafficking of women, recommended India to review the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act to include provisions preventing trafficking of women,,Concluding Observations on the Combined Fourth and Fifth Periodic Reports of India, at [23(a)] address the root causes of such trafficking,,Concluding Observations on the Combined Fourth and Fifth Periodic Reports of India, at [23(b)] ensure that the traffickers are effectively investigated and prosecuted,,Concluding Observations on the Combined Fourth and Fifth Periodic Reports of India, at [23(c)] and ensure that victims of trafficking have access to victim support and witness protection.,Concluding Observations on the Combined Fourth and Fifth Periodic Reports of India, at [23(d)] Source and destination states =Source states= The parents who sell the daughters as the molki brides are from the lower socioeconomic strata of the \\"under-developed or economically marginalised regions\\" and states, such as Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal. Mewat region in Haryana has molki brides even from Gujarat. =Destination states= The destinations are generally the \\"prosperous North Indian provinces\\" where sex ratio is more imbalanced. Some of the states are mainly Haryana, Punjab,Rajasthan and Western Uttar Pradesh. Haryana A 2019 survey by Jind based \\"Selfie-With-Daughter Foundation\\" found 130,000 molki brides in Haryana. Among them 1470 such brides \\"looted and scooted from their in-laws house with valuables and expensive items\\", indicating a phenomenon of criminal gangs engaging in the organised practice. Molki bride practice, which started from the Ahirwal and Mewat region in 1980s, is now \\"common in Rohtak, Jind, Hisar, Kaithal, Yamunanagar and Kurukshetra.\\"1.30 lakh Haryana brides ‘bought’ from other states: Survey, Times of India, 30 November 2019.

An unintended consequence of Haryana’s economic development is the advancement of medical technology and accessibility of its health care system which offer prenatal screening to determine the sex of the foetus. This has created a paradoxical situationSonali Mukherjee \\"Skewed Sex Ratio and Migrant Brides in Haryana: Reflections from the Field\\" (2013) 43 Social Change 37 at 40. where adverse sex ratio is perpetuated by parents routinely aborting female foetuses in favour of sons, meanwhile contributing to the increase in demand for imported brides. The Haryana government has taken several actions against female foeticide and gender discrimination, making them one of the most successful states in terms of improving sex ratio. According to the 2011 Census of India, Rajendra Khatry \\"Haryana’s Crisis: Bridegrooms All Decked Up But No One to Marry\\" (20 July 2014) Firstpost . there were 877 females to 1,000 males in Haryana against the national average of 933 females to 1000 males., Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, Government of India (2011) Census India . In 2019, due to various initiatives by the Government of Haryana the sex ratio has improved to 920 females births per 1000 male child. Punjab Rajasthan Molki bride phenomenon is found in various districts, including Alwar and Jhunjhunu. Uttar Pradesh This phenomenon has been found in the Western Uttar Pradesh which is relative more affluent region of the state of Uttar Pradesh. Critique =Disadvantages of molki system= According to the research of 10 source villages in Odisha as well as 1,216 molki brides in 226 villages in destination states of Haryana and Rajasthan, sponsored by the Royal Norwegian Embassy and titled \\"Tied in a Knot — cross-region marriages in Haryana and Rajasthan, Implications for Gender Rights and Gender Relations\\", the molki brides face color discrimination due to usually being darker, caste discrimination, names calling such as \\"molki\\" (one who was bought for money), slur like \\"Biharan\\" a term \\"that implies poverty, desperation, filth and savagery\\", judgmental attitude towards their parents who are seen as \\"thieves, sellers of daughters and primitive savages\\", leading to their social isolation and mental health issues. =Advantages of molki system= Advantages include social stratification in terms of socioeconomically disadvantaged men are able to find brides who also are disadvantaged, \\"dowry-free, no wedding expenses\\" for bride's poor family which also receives money, breaking of orthodox social taboos by making inter-caste and inter-religion marriages socially acceptable and \\"widespread\\". Some othodox khaps, which might usually oppose inter-caste marriages, generally provide a silence acceptance of the practice of molki brides by maintaining a \\"studied silence\\". Progressive panchyats and khaps have taken initiatives to champion rights of molki brides by campaigning to make the marriage registration mandatory for these brides so that they and their children have the legal rights. Activists have also demanded for extending government benefits of inter-caste marriages to molki marriages. Intervention against the bride trafficking To address the nationwide issues of female foeticide and female infanticide, the government of India has passed the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act 1994 which prohibits sex determination via prenatal screening. However, even if all discriminatory practice ceased, it is estimated that it will take at least 50 years for the population (in India) to reach its natural sex ratio., United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Current Status of Victim Service Providers and Criminal Justice Actors in India on Anti Human Trafficking (2013) at [96]. In 2002, the Union Ministry of Child and Development launched the Scheme for Women in Difficult Circumstances (SWADHAR) to protect the welfare of vulnerable women. The initiative aims to assist victims of exploitation to \\"lead their life with dignity and conviction.\\", Ministry of Women and Child Development SWADHAR GREH: A Scheme that Caters to Primary Needs for Women in Difficult Circumstances (2015) at [1].

This initiative, known as Apni Beti Apni Dhan or \\"Our Daughters, Our Wealth\\", was launched in Haryana from 1994-1998 by the State Department of Women and Children Development. It offered 500 rupees ($USD8) to families enrolled in the programme, within 14 days of giving birth to a girl and a second payment of 25,000 rupees ($USD380) on her 18th birthday provided she remained unmarried., Priya Nanda and others \\"Impact of a Conditional Cash Transfer Program on Girls’ Education and Age of Marriage in India\\" (2016) International Centre for Research on Women at 2.

In 2012 (as the first participants turned 18), a follow up assessment by International Centre for Research on Women showed that while enrolling in the programme incentivised the parents to delay marrying off their daughters, it revealed that financial incentives without other complementary interventions were inadequate to change the deeply entrenched gender roles and expectations on women., Priya Nanda and others \\"Impact of a Conditional Cash Transfer Program on Girls’ Education and Age of Marriage in India\\" (2016) International Centre for Research on Women at 6. =Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill 2016= In June 2016, the Trafficking Persons (Prevention and Rehabilitation) Bill was published.

In Singapore, there used to be a partial immunity for marital rape because it was not a criminal offence except when the wife is below 13 years of age or when any of the specific circumstances provided under section 375(4) of the Singapore Penal Code are satisfied.Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (Singapore) s 375(4). Since 1 January 2020, the immunity was lifted, criminalising all forms of rape. Marital rape has been identified by the United Nations General Assembly to be a form of violence against women in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (DEVAW).Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women GA Res 48/104, A/Res/48/104 (1994) at Article 2(a). The DEVAW is said to complement and strengthen the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which Singapore ratified on 5 October 1995.United Nations Treaty Collection website (accessed 26 August 2017). There are no documented statistics on the prevalence of marital rape in Singapore.Melissa Zhu, “Behind closed doors: Rape and marriage in Singapore” (20 August 2016) (accessed 26 August 2017). There has only been one reported case of marital rape in the Singapore courts.Public Prosecutor v N [1999] 3 SLR(R) 499. Nevertheless, it is believed that many victims of marital rape suffer in silence because of the knowledge of a lack of effective legal remedies as well as the social stigma attached to the issue.Rachel Au-Yong, “Immunity for marital rape being reviewed\\",The Straits Times, (5 April 2017) (accessed 27 August 2017). Marital rape immunity under Singapore law =Origins of the immunity= The marital rape immunity under Singapore law is believed to have originated from an extrajudicial remark by Sir Matthew Hale in “The History of the Pleas of the Crown”, where he stated that a husband cannot be guilty of marital rape against his wife because the latter had irrevocably consented to sexual relations during the marriage.1 Hale, Pleas of the Crown, at p. 629. This principle of irrevocable consent was later cited in several English cases as justification for immunity against marital rape.R v Clarence (1888) 22 QBD 23; R v Clarke [1949] 2 All ER 448 The immunity was eventually imported into Singapore law as part of the English common law by the application of English Law Act 1993.Application of English Law Act (Cap 7A, 1994 Rev Ed) s 3. =Legislative reform in 2007= The marital rape immunity was the subject of legislative amendments in the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007.Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007 (No. 51 of 2007) (Singapore). Prior to the amendments, section 375(e) provided blanket immunity to husbands who had non-consensual sexual intercourse with their wives as long as the latter was not below 13 years of age.Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (Singapore) s 375(e). See also Chan Wing Cheong, “Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2007: Rape within marriage” [2009] Sing JLS 257-271 at 257. The proposed amendment to section 375(e) did not seek to abolish the immunity altogether but, instead, sought to introduce exceptions to the immunity such that it would be lifted when there is some evidence of breakdown in the marriage concerned,UN Human Rights Council, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Singapore, 11 July 2011, A/HRC/18/11 at [49]. See also Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (4 February 2013) vol 90 (S Iswaran, Second Minister for Home Affairs). such as when: *the wife, who was living apart from her husband, has obtained an interim judgment of divorce or nullity, a judgment or decree of judicial separation, or a written separation agreement;Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (Singapore) s 375(4)(a). *the wife, who was living apart from her husband, has commenced legal proceedings for divorce, nullity or judicial separation;Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (Singapore) s 375(4)(b). *there is a court injunction that restrains the husband from having sexual intercourse with his wife;Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (Singapore) s 375(4)(c). *the wife has obtained a Protection Order or Expedited Order against her husband;Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (Singapore) s 375(4)(d). or *the wife has commenced proceedings for a Protection Order or Expedited Order from her husband.Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (Singapore) s 375(4)(e). Introducing the proposed amendments at the Second Reading debate of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 2007, then Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Assoc. Prof Ho Peng Kee described the proposed section 375(4) as a “calibrated approach” that balances the “needs of women who require protection, general concerns about conjugal rights and the expression of intimacy in a marriage”.Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (22 October 2007) vol 83 (Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs). To this end, total abolition of the immunity was precluded as the Ministry was concerned that such a radical step would “change the whole complexion of marriage” in the Singaporean society.Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (22 October 2007) vol 83 (Eunice Elizabeth Olsen, Nominated Member). Whilst the Members of Parliament (MPs) were unequivocal in their condemnation of marital rape in principle, reactions to the extent of the proposed amendments were mixed. On the one hand, MP Dr Teo Ho Pin supported the Ministry's calibrated approach, recognising the difficulties inherent in determining lack of consent in sexual relations between married spouses.Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (22 October 2007) vol 83 (Teo Ho Pin, Bukit Panjang). It was suggested that women in strained marriages should express their non-consent by taking out legal proceedings, as outlined in the proposed section 375(4), from which the intention of non-consent for sexual intercourse with their husbands may be more clearly inferred.Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (22 October 2007) vol 83 (Teo Ho Pin, Bukit Panjang). On the other hand, several MPs spoke in support of the total abolition of the marital rape immunity.See generally the speeches of Members of Parliament Eunice Elizabeth Olsen, Siew Kum Hong, Ho Geok Choo, Charles Chong. MP Ellen Lee questioned the lack of safeguards in cases where the wife has not yet commenced the legal processes required to lift the immunity or is unable to do so because of financial or emotional reasons.Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (23 October 2007) vol 83 (Ellen Lee, Sembawang). MP Ho Geok Choo criticised the proposed amendments as being insufficient to protect women who are “most dependent on their husbands as well as those who will have the least access to legal counsel”.Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (23 October 2007) vol 83 (Ho Geok Choo, West Coast GRC). Several MPs also expressed concern at the presumption of the wife's consent to have sexual intercourse in the proposed section 375(4), suggesting that there should not be a difference drawn between rape occurring within the context of a marriage and outside of one.Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (22 October 2007) vol 83 (Siew Kum Hong, Nominated Member); Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (22 October 2007) vol 83 (Indranee Rajah, Tanjong Pagar). Eventually, the Bill was passed without modification and came into force on 1 January 2008. =Calls for total abolition= Since the 2007 legislative amendments, there have been ongoing calls for the total abolition of the marital rape immunity both domestically and internationally. In 2009, a Singapore-based online petition \\"No to Rape\\" was set up to specifically campaign for the total abolition of the immunity. A total of 3,618 individuals signed the petition to the Prime Minister of Singapore for the repeal of section 375(4).Petition submitted by No to Rape (accessed 26 August 2017). In the international arena, the Canadian delegation recommended the introduction of legislation to criminalise marital rape in all circumstances during Singapore's Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in 2011. It was noted that this recommendation did not enjoy the support of the Singapore Government.UN Human Rights Council, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Singapore, 11 July 2011, A/HRC/18/11 at [97.13]. In the Stakeholder's Report to the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, a joint submission by several non-governmental organisationsThe non-governmental organisations were the Association of Women for Action and Research, Challenged People's Alliance and Network (CAN!), Deaf and Hard of Hearing Federation, Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics, MARUAH (Working Group for an ASEAN Human Rights Mechanism, Singapore), People Like Us; Singaporeans for Democracy, and Transient Workers Count Too. also called for the partial immunity for marital rape to be repealed.UN Human Rights Council, Summary prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in accordance with paragraph 15(c) of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 5/1: Singapore, 21 February 2011, A/HRC/WG.6/11/SGP/3 at [17]. At Singapore's UPR in 2016, the need for the abolition of the marital rape immunity was reiterated.UN Human Rights Council, Compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in accordance with paragraph 15(b) of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21: Singapore, 20 November 2015, A/HRC/WG.6/24/SGP/2 at [16]; UN Human Rights Council, Addendum to the Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Singapore, 13 June 2016, A/HRC/32/17/Add.1 at [17]. In response, Ambassador-at-Large Chan Heng Chee noted that Singapore “would actively review the need to repeal the marital rape immunity”.UN Human Rights Council, Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Singapore, 15 April 2016, A/HRC/32/17 at [163]. While no definitive answer has been given to the question of whether or when the marital rape immunity will be repealed,Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (15 August 2016) vol 94 (Louis Ng Kok Kwang, Nee Soon GRC). some believe that Singapore's response at the 2016 UPR indicates that the abolition of the marital rape immunity is forthcoming.Melissa Zhu, “Behind closed doors: Rape and marriage in Singapore” (20 August 2016) (accessed 26 August 2017). In April 2017, then Minister of Social and Family Development, Mr Tan Chuan-Jin confirmed in Parliament that review of the marital rape immunity is underway.Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (4 April 2017) vol 94 (Tan Chuan-Jin, Minister for Social and Family Development). To this end, he expressed the view that “married women should have the same access to protection as unmarried women” and “although married persons have conjugal rights over each other, such rights should be exercised within reasonable behaviour”.Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (4 April 2017) vol 94 (Tan Chuan-Jin, Minister for Social and Family Development). = Repeal = The Criminal Law Reform Act 2019 was passed on 6 May 2019, which includes repealing marital rape immunity. The new laws came into force on 1 January 2020. Singapore’s obligations under CEDAW Marital rape, and by extension legal immunities to marital rape, are contrary to human rights as a recognised form of violence against women in the DEVAW.Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women GA Res 48/104, A/Res/48/104 (1994) at Article 2(a). Article 2 of the CEDAW, which Singapore has ratified, ‘condemns discrimination against woman in all its forms’.UN General Assembly, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 18 December 1979, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1249, p. 13 at Article 2. Further, Article 16 of the CEDAW requires state parties “to eliminate discrimination against woman in all matters relating to marriage and family relations” to ensure equality between men and women.UN General Assembly, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 18 December 1979, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1249, p. 13 at Article 16. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW Committee) in their General Recommendation 19 has also identified family violence, including marital rape, as a form of discrimination under Article 16.UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, General Recommendations No. 19, adopted at the Eleventh Session, 1992 (contained in Document A/47/38), 1992, A/47/38 at [23]. It has also been suggested that the non-criminalisation of marital rape amounts to discriminatory treatment in two ways – first, by discriminating between violence directed at women specifically from other types of violence, and, second, by discriminating between violence inflicted in the private sphere and public sphere.Melanie Randall & Vasanthi Venkatesh, “The right to no: the crime of marital rape, women’s human rights, and international law” [2015] 41:1 Brook J Int’l L 153 at 189. Singapore has made reservations to a number of provisions in the CEDAW, including Article 2 paragraphs (a) to (f), and Article 16 paragraphs 1(a), (c), (h) and (2).Singapore's reservations to CEDAW (accessed 26 August 2017). Noting this at Singapore's fourth periodic report to the CEDAW Committee in 2011, the Committee called for the State to withdraw these reservations which “are impermissible, since those articles are fundamental to the implementation” of the Convention.Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women: Singapore, 16 January 2012, CEDAW/C/SGP/CO/4/Rev.1 at [13]. Furthermore, the Committee also highlighted the limited effectiveness of section 375(4) in safeguarding women against domestic and sexual violence given that the immunity is only lifted in specific circumstances – that the perpetrator and the victim are living apart and are in the midst of terminating their marriage or that the victim has applied for a protective order against the perpetrator.Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women: Singapore, 16 January 2012, CEDAW/C/SGP/CO/4/Rev.1 at [23]. Hence, the Committee urged for the criminalisation of marital rape and for the definition of rape to cover every non-consensual sexual act.Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women: Singapore, 16 January 2012, CEDAW/C/SGP/CO/4/Rev.1 at [24(a)]. Other human rights concerns =Freedom from torture= The right not to be subject to torture, which has been enshrined in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT),UN General Assembly, Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 10 December 1984, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1465, p. 85. is said to encompass the right to be free from domestic violence and rape (including marital rape).Melanie Randall & Vasanthi Venkatesh, “The right to no: the crime of marital rape, women’s human rights, and international law” [2015] 41:1 Brook J Int’l L 153 at 179. Singapore has not ratified the CAT Ratification status for Singapore (accessed 26 August 2017). and thus is not legally bound to give effect to the Convention's prohibition against torture in its domestic laws. =Right to security of the person= It has been suggested that legal immunities to marital rape infringes the right to security of the person, which is protected by Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) as well as Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).Melanie Randall & Vasanthi Venkatesh, “The right to no: the crime of marital rape, women’s human rights, and international law” [2015] 41:1 Brook J Int’l L 153 at 179. The United Nations Human Rights Committee in its General Comment 35 on Article 9 recognised that, in order to safeguard the right of security of persons, State parties are obliged to “respond appropriately” to patterns of violence against woman, such as instances of domestic violence.Human Rights Committee, General comment No. 35, 16 December 2014, CCPR/C/GC/35 at [9]. However, Singapore, not being a state party to the ICCPR, is not as such obliged. Another aspect of safeguarding the right to security of persons concerns one's right to bodily security.Melanie Randall & Vasanthi Venkatesh, “The right to no: the crime of marital rape, women’s human rights, and international law” [2015] 41:1 Brook J Int’l L 153 at 186. The CEDAW Committee has suggested that definitions of rape, including marital rape, that are based on the use of force rather than the lack of consent fails to satisfy the state's obligations to ensure the protection of a women's right to bodily security.Melanie Randall & Vasanthi Venkatesh, “The right to no: the crime of marital rape, women’s human rights, and international law” [2015] 41:1 Brook J Int’l L 153 at 196. In the same vein, a presumption of the ongoing existence of consent in a marital relationship, such as the victim's implied consent under section 375(4),Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (22 October 2007) vol 83 (Siew Kum Hong, Nominated Member); Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (22 October 2007) vol 83 (Indranee Rajah, Tanjong Pagar). also constitutes a violation.Melanie Randall & Vasanthi Venkatesh, “The right to no: the crime of marital rape, women’s human rights, and international law” [2015] 41:1 Brook J Int’l L 153 at 197. =Right to health and well-being= Rape can lead to adverse psychological and health effects in victims – the World Health Organisation has identified the risk of pregnancy and gynaecological complications, the risk of contracting sexually-transmitted diseases, increased suicidal tendencies and social ostracisation as some of them.World Health Organisation, \\"World Report on Health and Violence 2002”, at p 162 – 165. Sexual assault by an intimate partner increases the likelihood of post-traumatic stress disorder in victims as compared to sexual assault by a non-intimate partner.Jeff R. Temple, Rebecca Weston, Benjamin F. Rodrigeuz, Linda L. Marshall, “Differing Effects of Partner and Nonpartner Sexual Assault on Women’s Mental Health”, Violence Against Women 2007; 13(3): 285-297. Thus, legal immunities against marital rape arguably amount to a violation of a woman's right to health and well-being,Melanie Randall & Vasanthi Venkatesh, “The right to no: the crime of marital rape, women’s human rights, and international law” [2015] 41:1 Brook J Int’l L 153 at 194-195. which is a right protected by Article 25(1) of the UDHR.UN General Assembly, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 10 December 1948, 217 A (III) at Article 25(1). Although Singapore has yet to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR),Ratification status for Singapore (accessed 11 October 2017). it is noted that Article 12 of the ICESCR obliges state parties to \\"recognise the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health\\".UN General Assembly, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 16 December 1966, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 993, p. 3 at Article 12. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its General Comment No. 22 (2016) clarified that Article 12 encompasses the right to sexual and reproductive health and that the fulfilment of which requires state parties to enact legal prohibitions against harmful practises and gender-based violence, including marital rape, to enable individuals to make autonomous decisions on matters regarding their sexual and reproductive health.Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General comment No. 22 (2016) on the right to sexual and reproductive health (article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), 2 May 2016, E/C.12/GC/22 at [29] and [49(d)].

This code improves the quality of healthcare in New Zealand and ensures that there is a consistent expectation for all consumers. Development/history The Health and Disability Commissioner Act was introduced in 1994 after the Cartwright Inquiry in 1987-1988, a study was published on the treatment of carcinoma in situ. Some women were not getting the treatment they should have been provided or over treatment, overall, they were not getting the treatment that would have nursed them back to full health, instead, they were being used to conduct an experiment. In 1994 the Health and Disability Commissioner Act was passed,Mullen, K (2015), Patient's right to information under the New Zealand Code of Rights, Journal of law and medicine, 218 to protect consumers so they can get effective, fair and least time-consuming treatment.Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994 s 6 Patient's right is also addressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 25 where it says everyone has the right to a standard of health and also medical care.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights page Also in International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Article 12 which states that states have to recognise that everyone has the right to obtain the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. United Nations Human Rights page On 1 July 1996, the Code of Health and Disability Service Consumers’ Right came into force,Health and Disability Commissioner (Code of Health and Disability Service Consumers’ Right) Regulations 1996 reg 78 with ten core rights. In 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014 the code was under review, the only thing that was changed was Right 7(10).The Code of Rights The Code Under the Health and Disability Act 1994 we can find the Code of Rights, which are summarised into ten main right. Everyone practicing in the field must follow the code and provide service according to the rights patients have. Patients are referred to as consumers and health care referred to as a service. All providers have to inform consumers of their rights and make it possible for them to take action, hence why in most medical practices around the country there are red posters that contain the ten rights on the wall to make consumers aware of their rights.Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994 s 1 (3) (b) = Purpose = The purpose of the Code is to make sure the patients’ consumers’ rights are promoted and protected when using the health service, the provider of these services must prove that they have taken all the reasonable steps to ensure they respect those rights.Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994 s 3 This ensures that a repeat of the incident in 1988 will not happen, customers will not be taken advantage of because they are not informed on what is expected of the provider. Also improving the quality of health care and disability services, and making it easier to resolve conflict on the service provided. = Respect = This is laid out in Rule 1, which states that consumers are to be treated with respect, their needs, values, and beliefs should be accounted for.Health and Disability Commissioner (Code of Health and Disability Service Consumers’ Right) Regulations 1996 Right 1 This means if patients were given a rude comment due to their life choice, religion or disability, the service provider has breached the Code.Skegg P, Paterson R, Health Law in New Zealand 2015, Wellington, pg 40 = Fair Treatment = Right 2 says that patients should not be discriminated, pressured to do anything, taken advantage of. Freedom from discrimination is in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990New Zealand Bill of Right Act 1990 s19 which means it is expected for everyone but especially in the medical profession everyone should get the same treatment and be treated the same. No one should get an advantage in better treatment or sooner treatment because of the colour of their skin, sexual orientation, age, education etc. Medical treatment resource allocation should be made with professional medical judgment base on medical conditions.Skegg P, Paterson R, Health Law in New Zealand 2015, Wellington, pg 40- 42 The Code of ethics reinforce this right, service providers are seen to have more power over the patient in a doctor client relationship, they have to make sure that client is not being pressured into something they would have agreed to if they were not in this relationship, otherwise that is a breach of fiduciary duty.Code of Rights cl 4 = Dignity and Independence = The services are to help consumers resume back to full health to live dignified and independent life if a patient can achieve something on their own and they do not need support, it is within their right to refuse treatment. The right to be treated with dignity means that the provider shall preserve the state of being worthy of honor and respect. To be treated with independence means that the patient is treated like a human being. = Proper Standards = Right 4 states that consumers should be treated with care and skill according to their needs, a patient’s health cannot be risked if there is a better treatment available. Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee is an English case that set the test on medical standard, it was concluded that if the service provider can prove that they made the medical judgement as a reasonable medical person, where other colleges in the profession will agree, then they should not be liable for the damages. The Proper standard also includes legal, ethical and other standards, not just professional standard. That means the standard on other statute and the code of ethics are going to be upheld in the code of rights.Skegg P, Paterson R, Health Law in New Zealand 2015, Wellington, pg 41-44 = Communication = The service provider must make sure that the information given to consumers is understood, if not they can ask questions until it makes sense, this may include organising interpretation service, finding a support person, talking to the parents, etc.Health and Disability Commissioner (Code of Health and Disability Service Consumers’ Right) Regulations 1996 Right 5 If there are any concerns about the patient’s understanding of the information, it should be noted down that the patient has communication needs. = Information = All information including pros and cons of the treatment, costs, and alternatives should be passed onto the patient, even the tests they are going to perform with patients’ blood is something that needs consent.Peart, N., & Jing, B. N. (2015). A patients' rights approach: The new zealand perspective. Asian Bioethics Review, 7(4) This also includes information they have found, even when there are no treatment decisions to be made. Doctors have the duty to give out results to their patients, but not to anyone else even their spouse, unless given permission by the patient.Privacy Act 1993, Privacy Code 1994 Rule 4 -6 If they fail to do that, it will be a breach of this code and even breach of privacy Act 1993. = Your decision = Under right 6, consumers have the right to know all the findings of their health condition to make an informed decision. Information on the provider of the service should disclose information about their service or history of service if they are information that might impact the decision-making process. After all the information are disclosed to the patient, it is up to them to decide, at any time if they wish to stop they can. The only time when there is no choice in treatment is when they are being treated under a court order. Patients must consent to all treatment they receive after being informed, but cases where they cannot consent and no one that is legally authorised to do so, the person giving out the service should provide the service in line with what they understand to be in the best interest of the patient.Health and Disability Commissioner (Code of Health and Disability Service Consumers’ Right) Regulations 1996 Right 7(4) Unless the patient has consented in writing they cannot be part of an experiment or treatment that is research related, ordinary treatment’s consent does not need to be in writing. Skegg P, Paterson R, Health Law in New Zealand 2015, Wellington, pg 49-52 They can choose to stop the treatment or service any time they wish. = Support = Right 8 provides that consumers can have a support person with them during most services unless it is unsafe or in conflict with another right. Patients have the right to choose who is there with them, or who they do not want to be there.The Code of Rights = Teaching and research = This right ensures that no patients will be used for teaching or research purposes if they do not consent to it and if they do agree to it during the teaching and research they will remain to have all the rights listed.Health and Disability Commissioner (Code of Health and Disability Service Consumers’ Right) Regulations 1996 Right 9 = Complaints = This is laid out in Right 10. It is the section on complaints all consumers have the right to make a complaint. Complaints made will be investigated by the Commissioners, If the issue is small and does not involve serious professional misconduct, the matter can be resolved by advocacy and mediation, talking face to face to resolve complaints. This is proven to be very successful. As most conflicts have been resolved when the mediation process has been used.Paterson, R. R. (2005). Protecting patients' rights in new zealand. Medicine and Law 24(1), 56 Code of ethics In the medical profession, everybody must follow the code of ethics when they are practicing, this is on top of the code of rights, but also enforcing the purpose of those rights. This is like the ethics codes in other professional fields, treating clients ethically.NZMA Code of Ethics 2014 Medical practitioners are expected to follow several principles of ethical behavior. The health and well-being of the patient are of first priority. The autonomy, freedoms, and rights are to be respected. Exploitation of the patient is to be avoided. Compassion, moral integrity, and respect for human dignity are to be exercised during the practice of medical science. With exceptions considering public interest or patient safety, the private information of the patient is to be protected throughout the lifetime and beyond. In order for the best possible advice and treatment to be offered to the patient, knowledge, and skills are to be improved. The limits of current knowledge are to be acknowledged whilst the scientific basis for medical practice is followed.NZMA Code of Ethics for the New Zealand Medical Profession The responsibilities of assisting in the protection and increased health of the community, the advocation for proper resources to maximise access to medical services across the community, and the maintenance and improvisation of professional standards are to be accepted. Breaches If commissioners find a breach, they can send the matter to Human Rights Review Tribunal, Paterson, R. R. van Wyk, M. M. (2004). Patients' rights in new Zealand Complaints resolution and quality improvement. Medicine and Law 23(1), 29-38. these proceedings will be paid by the state not the patient,Peart, N., & JinN, B. N. (2015). A patients' rights approach: The New Zealand perspective. Asian Bioethics Review, 7(4) pg 415 there have not been many decisions made by the tribunal, so there are not a lot of example cases.

This assigns to these entities, the rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities and legal liability of a legal personality. Environmental personhood emerged from the evolution of legal focus in pursuit of the protection of nature. Over time, focus has evolved from human interests in exploiting nature, to protecting nature for future human generations, to conceptions that allow for nature to be protected as intrinsically valuable.Gwendolyn Gordon. \\"Environmental Personhood.\\" (2017), at page 25. This concept can be used as a vehicle for recognising Indigenous peoples' relationships to natural entities, such as rivers.James DK Morris and Jacinta Ruru. \\"Giving Voice to Rivers: Legal Personality as a Vehicle for Recognising Indigenous Peoples' Relationships to Water.\\" AILR 14 (2010): 49. Environmental personhood, which assigns nature (or aspects of it) certain rights, concurrently provides a means to individuals or groups such as Indigenous peoples to fulfill their human rights. Background The United States Professor Christopher D. Stone first discussed the idea of attributing legal personality to natural objects in the 1970s, in his article \\"Should trees have standing? Towards legal rights for natural objects\\".Christopher D. Stone. \\"Should Trees Have Standing--Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects.\\" Southern California Law Review 45 (1972): 450. A legal person cannot be owned; therefore, no ownership can be attributed to an environmental entity with established legal personality. Standing (law) is directly related to legal personality. Entities with standing, or locus standi, have the right or capacity to bring action or appear in court. Environmental entities cannot themselves bring action or appear in court. However, this action or standing can be achieved on behalf of the entity by a representing legal guardian. Representation could increase protection of culturally significant aspects of the natural environment, or areas vulnerable to exploitation and pollution. Domestic rights of nature =New Zealand= In 2014, Te Urewera National Park was declared Te Urewera, an environmental legal entity.Te Urewera Act 2014. The area encompassed by Te Urewera ceased to be a government-owned national park and was transformed into freehold, inalienable land owned by itself.Te Urewera Act 2014, ss 12-13. Following the same trend, New Zealand’s Whanganui River was declared to be a legal person in 2017.Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017, s 14. This new legal entity was named Te Awa Tupua and is now recognised as “an indivisible and living whole from the mountains to the sea, incorporating the Whanganui River and all of its physical and metaphysical elements.”Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017, s 13(b). The river would be represented by two guardians, one from the Whanganui iwi and the other from the Crown. Also in 2017, the New Zealand government signed an agreement granting similar legal personality to Mount Taranaki and pledging a name change for Egmont National Park, which surrounds the mountain.Te Anga Pūtakerongo - Record of Understanding, 5.5.2 =India= The Ganges and Yamuna Rivers are now considered legal persons in an effort to combat pollution. The rivers are sacred to Hindu culture for their healing powers and attraction of pilgrims who bathe and scatter the ashes of their dead.Dr Susan Bliss. \\"A river is a 'person'.\\" 49 Geography Bulletin No 2 (2017): 17. The rivers have been heavily polluted by 1.5 billion litres of untreated sewage and 500 million litres of industrial waste entering the rivers daily. The High Court in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand ordered in March 2017 that the Ganges and its main tributary, the Yamuna, be assigned the status of legal entities. The rivers would gain “all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a living person.” This decision meant that polluting or damaging the rivers is equivalent to harming a person. The court cited the example of the New Zealand Whanganui River, which was also declared to possess full rights of a legal person. This development of environmental personhood has been met with scepticism as merely announcing that the Ganges and Yamuna are living entities will not save them from significant, ongoing pollution. There is a possible need to change long-held cultural attitudes towards the Ganges, which hold that the river has self-purifying properties.http://www.unep.org/stories/story/rights-rivers/ There is further criticism that the guardianship of the rivers was only granted to Uttarakhand, a region in northern India which houses a small part of the rivers’ full extent. The Ganges flows for 2,525 km through Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, with only a 96 km stretch running through Uttarakhand. Only a small section of the 1,376 km Yamuna tributary runs through Uttarakhand – which also crosses through the states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Regardless of scepticism surrounding the decision of the Uttarakhand High Court, proclaiming these vulnerable rivers as legal entities invokes a movement of change towards environmental and cultural rights protection. The decisions may be built upon as a foundation for future environmental legislative change. =United States= In 2006, a small community in Pennsylvania called Tamaqua Borough worked with a rights of nature group called the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF).CELDF. https://celdf.org/. Together, the groups drafted legislation to protect the community and its environment from the dumping of toxic sewage.Gwendolyn Gordon. \\"Environmental Personhood.\\" (2017), at page 10. Since 2006, CELDF has assisted with over 30 communities in ten states across the United States to develop local laws codifying the rights of nature. CELDF also assisted in the drafting of Ecuador's 2008 constitution following a national referendum.CELDF, Rights of Nature: Timeline. https://celdf.org/rights/rights-of-nature/rights-nature-timeline/. Besides Tamaqua, several other towns throughout the United States have drafted legislation that would, in effect, give nature natural rights. In 2008, residents in a town by the name of Shapleigh, Maine added a new section to their cities legal code. This new section stripped the rights of corporations granted by the United States Constitution, and granted rights to the nature and natural bodies of water that surrounded Shapleigh. What prompted the change to Shapleigh's legal code was a plan by the Nestle Corporation, which owns several water bottle brands such as Poland Spring, to pump truckloads of groundwater from Shapleigh to a water bottling facility. As of 2019, no lawsuits have been filed against Shapleigh, Maine for the change in the town's legal code, and the Nestle Corporation has not chosen to challenge the code either. In this case the CELDF did not assist the residents of Shapleigh in drafting sections 99-11 through 99-12 of their legal code, they were instead assisted by lawyers from Vermont. In April 2013, the CELDF assisted officials in Mora County, New Mexico in creating an ordinance that limited the ability of corporations to extract gas and oil, and gave rights to the natural ecosystems and bodies of water that resided within Mora County.Garcia, Paula A., Olivas, John P., and Alfonso J. Griego, county commissioners. Mora County, New Mexico Ordinance 2013-01. April 29, 2013. Accessed 22 May 2019. http://countyofmora.com/sites/default/files/2013%2001%20Oil%20%26%20Gas%20Ord..pdf This ordinance made Mora County the very first place within the United States to ban the production of gas and oil, within a certain area, in an official statement. A lawsuit was filed against Mora County on November 12, 2013 which asserted that Mora County's ordinance infringed on corporations rights, especially the first, fifth, and fourteenth amendments. In January 2015, Mora County's ordinance was overthrown by U.S. District Judge James O. Browning as he viewed the ordinance to violate the first amendment rights of corporations. In early 2014, Grant Township, Indiana, Pennsylvania enlisted the CELDF's help in drafting an ordinance that would give the natural bodies of water surrounding Grant Township natural rights. A company named Pennsylvania General Energy (PGE) had converted an old oil and gas well into a \\"wastewater injection well,\\" and residents became concerned for what that could mean for the natural ecosystems surrounding their township. The water in a wastewater injection well is waste that is left over from a process called fracking. This water can contain harmful pollutants and chemicals that can poison groundwater. In Grant Township, most residents rely on the Little Mahoning Creek for their water needs. If the wastewater injection well were to leak, there is a possibility it could contaminate the Little Mahoning. The risk of contamination is what prompted Grant Township residents to ask the CELDF for assistance in drafting an ordinance. Grant Township's ordinance gave natural rights to the ecosystems and bodies of water that were within the borders of Grant Township. Grant Township's ordinance also stripped corporations of their rights deeming that corporations would not be seen as \\"persons\\" within the borders of Grant Township. In August 2014, PGE sued Grant Township which began a legal battle that would last for almost five years. Grant Township lost the lawsuit against PGE in April 2019, and Judge Susan Baxter ordered Grant Township to pay PGE's legal expenses which were over $100,000. In addition, Grant Township's ordinance was declared invalid. On 26 February 2019, voters in Toledo, Ohio passed the Lake Erie Bill of Rights. The main point of the Lake Erie Bill of Rights is that Lake Erie has the right to \\"flourish.\\" Residents of Toledo, and surrounding areas, have suffered times where the tap water, which comes from Lake Erie, was not safe to drink, or use, due to pollution. Cases of unsafe water conditions, amongst other pollution problems, is what prompted residents of Toledo to ask the CELDF for help. On 27 February 2019, the day after the Lake Erie Bill of Rights was passed by voters, a lawsuit was filed by an Ohio farmer. On 27 February 2020, U.S. District Judge Jack Zouhary invalidated the bill, ruling it was \\"unconstitutionally vague\\" and beyond \\"the power of municipal government in Ohio.\\" =Ecuador= The rights of nature “to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles” have been proclaimed under Ecuador’s 2008 constitution.Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (October 20, 2008), http://therightsofnature.org/wpcontent/uploads/pdfs/Rights-for-Nature- Articles-in-Ecuadors-Constitution.pdf. This occurred after a national referendum in 2008, allowing the Ecuador constitution to reflect rights for nature, a world first.Andrew C. Revkin, Ecuador Constitution Grants Rights to Nature, New York Times, (September 29, 2008), http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/ecuador-constitution-grants- nature-rights/. Every person and community has the right to advocate on nature's behalf.Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (October 20, 2008), Chapter 7. The Constitution proclaims that the “State shall give incentives to natural persons and legal entities and to communities to protect nature and to promote respect for all the elements comprising an ecosystem.”Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (October 20, 2008), Article 71. The first successful case of the rights of nature implementation under Ecuador constitutional law was presented before the Provincial Court of Justice of Loja in 2011. This case involved the Vilcabamba River as the plaintiff, representing itself with its own rights to ‘exist’ and ‘maintain itself’ – as it attempted to halt construction of a government highway project interfering with the natural health of the river. This case was brought before court by two individuals, Richard Frederick Wheeler and Eleanor Geer Huddle, as legal guardians acting in favour of nature – specifically the Vilcabamba River. A constitutional injunction was granted in favour of the Vilcabamba River and against the Provincial government of Loja, attempting to conduct the environmentally- harmful project. The project was forced to be halted and the area was to be rehabilitated.Natalia Greene. \\"The first successful case of the Rights of Nature implementation in Ecuador.\\" Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature. http://therightsofnature.org/first-ron-case-ecuador/. =Bolivia= The constitutional change in Ecuador was followed legislatively by Bolivia in 2010, passing the ‘Law of the Rights of Mother Earth’ (Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra). This legislation designates Mother Earth the character of ‘a collective subject of public interest’Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 5. with inherent rights specified in the law.Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 7. The Law of the Rights of Mother Earth give aspects of legal personhood to the natural environment. Judicial action can be taken for infringements against individuals and groups as part of Mother Earth as ‘a collective subject of public interest’.Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 6. The legislation states that “Mother Earth is the dynamic living system made up of the indivisible community of all living systems, living, interrelated, interdependent and complementary, sharing a common destiny.”Ley de Derechos de la Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 3. =Colombia= The Colombia Constitutional Court found in November 2016 that the Atrato River basin possesses rights to \\"protection, conservation, maintenance, and restoration.\\" This ruling came about as a result of degradation to the river basin from mining, impacting nature and harming of Indigenous peoples and their culture. The court referred to the New Zealand declaration of the Whanganui River as a legal person holding environmental personhood. The court ordered that joint guardianship would be undertaken in the representation of the Atrato River basin. Similarly to the New Zealand declaration, the representatives would come from the national government and the Indigenous people living in the basin. The court stated: :“(I)t is the human populations that are interdependent of the natural world – and not the opposite – and that they must assume the consequences of their actions and omissions with the nature. It is a question of understanding this new sociopolitical reality with the aim of achieving a respectful transformation with the natural world and its environment, as has happened before with civil and political rights…Now is the time to begin taking the first steps to effectively protect the planet and its resources before it is too late…” In April 2018 the Supreme Court of Colombia has issued a decision recognizing the Amazon River ecosystem as a subject of rights and beneficiary of protection. Significance for cultural human rights The recognition of the Whanganui River as a legal entity in New Zealand (Te Awa Tupua) encompassed a vivid sense of cultural “inalienable connection” to the local iwi and hapu of the river. Māori culture considers natural features such as the Whanganui River as ancestors and iwi hold deep connections with them as living entities. This inalienable connection of indigenous culture to their natural surroundings is apparent in other parts of the world such as Colombia where a similar environmental personhood declaration was made for the Atrato River basin. The lead negotiator for the Whanganui iwi, Gerrard Albert, said “we consider the river an ancestor and always have…treating the river as a living entity is the correct way to approach it, as an indivisible whole, instead of the traditional model for the last 100 years of treating it from a perspective of ownership and management.” James D K Morris and Jacinta Ruru suggest that giving “legal personality to rivers is one way in which the law could develop to provide a lasting commitment to reconciling with Maori.” This was the longest-running legal dispute in New Zealand. The Whanganui iwi had been fighting to assert their rights in harmony with the river since the 1870s.

Biography  Di Genova graduated in History of Art at La Sapienza University of Rome with a dissertation on Silvestro Lega. He then became a member of the Italian Communist Party, only to leave after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. In 1975 he founded the quarterly magazine Third Eye, published by Bora in Bologna, which he edited until 2006. In 1984 he was the curator of the Italian Pavilion at the 41st edition of the Venice Biennale, where he invited Antonio Bueno, Mario Padovan and Novello Finotti. In 1993 he was one of the organizers of the 12th Rome Quadriennale. In 1980 he was appointed Artistic Director of the National Biennial of Contemporary Art in the Province of Rieti. The first edition, Generation Twenties, was followed by two more, Generazione Anni Dieci (1982) and Generazione Primo Decennio (1985). Disagreements over the direction of the biennial lead to Di Genova's resignation in 1986. In 1990 he started working on a revised and expanded edition of his bookHistory of Italian Art of the Twentieth Century (1981). In 1999 Di Genova was one of the founders of Museo MAGI '900 in Pieve di Cento near Bologna. Di Genova was also Artistic Director until his resignation in 2006. In 2008, he was appointed Artistic Director of the Lìmen International Art Prize by the Chamber of Commerce of Vibo Valentia.  Works  *“Il Prometeo”. Scultura di Vittorio Amadio.

Born in Hamburg in 1852, Budge was the daughter of the merchant Ludwig Lazarus. She married Henry Budge and they emigrated to the US. Budge and her husband returned to Hamburg in 1903. They lived at the so-called \\"Budge-Palais\\" on the Alster, Hamburg, and amassed a large art collection. In her will, Budge had specified that her art collection was not to be sold in Nazi Germany. However, a large portion of it was sold at auction in Berlin in October 1937, the proceeds going to a Budge estate account at M. M. Warburg & Co. bank. The bank was subsequently Aryanized, her Jewish executors dismissed, and her heirs defrauded of their money. At the 1937 auction, Otto and Magdalena Blohm bought seven 18th-century Italian commedia dell'arte porcelain figures that had been part of the Budge collection. Edward and Kiyi Pflueger later acquired the figures and in 2006 bequeathed them to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA). The Budge heirs later demanded their return.

She is the founder and artistic director of the internationally renowned Nadine Bommer Dance Company.  Early life and training  Though born in New York City, Nadine Bommer spent most of her childhood in Rishon LeZion, Israel. The drive to create dance productions has been ever-present in her life, and Bommer began creating when she was still just a child. Following her amateur productions for family, friends, and neighbors, Bommer was invited to head the student production at her school when she was only 11 years old, and then again in junior high and high school. She received a scholarship from the mayor for her impressive work as a child choreographer/director, and was invited to teach dance to a local group of students following the show produced in her junior year of high school. Intermittently throughout her childhood, Bommer traveled to NYC with her mother, studying dance at the American Ballet Theatre School and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater School while there. As a young adult, Bommer focused on teaching dance. At the age of 21, she opened the first in a series of successful dance studios in Israel. With her established school and developing choreography, Bommer began to codify the technique and artistic philosophy that now sustains her career and choreographic work.  Career  Bommer began her career as an educator, opening her first dance studio, Ketzev Hagoof, in 1990. Ketzev Hagoof still teaches dance to children throughout Israel, offering classes at their original location and multiple branches throughout the country. In 1994, Bommer shifted her focus, opening another school called the Nadine Bommer Dance Academy. This school of contemporary dance focuses on preparing students for professional careers in dance and classes are based in Bommer's technique the Nadine Bommer Method (see technique section). Nadine Bommer Dance Academy is currently the flagship location offering this technique to aspiring professional dancers. In 1997 Bommer established her dance company, beginning performances of work inspired by the early stages of her method. As she continued to make work, Bommer codified her technique, working through stages focused on classical technique (Nevet), improvisation (Kinetica), and characterization (Animato). The final stage of the method, Animato, was completed in 2006, leading to a new phase of the company centered in comedic narrative dance works. In 2007, Bommer began receiving sustained support from the Israeli Ministry of Science, Culture & Sports. This year also marked the premiere of her landmark work Manimation which received great acclaim as Bommer's first work fully utilizing the Nadine Bommer Method. Following Manimation, Bommer choreographed three new full-length works in quick succession, American Cinema, Invisi'BALL, and Poodle It. Her humorous depiction of a soccer championship in Invisi'BALL rose to international acclaim, leading the company to tours all over the world. In tandem with this success, Bommer's teenage daughter Gaya Bommer-Yemini received prominence in the award-winning documentary First Position. The film featured Bommer's choreography as her daughter won many prizes while performing it around the world.  Return to New York  In 2015 Bommer was invited to present work in New York City after an anonymous donor sponsored her relocation. At this time the company took on a cross-continental structure, working with dancers based in both NYC and Israel. In NYC, Bommer began working with a new group of dancers, teaching them the Nadine Bommer Method and mounting her international sensation Invisi'BALL for its NYC premiere. After only a few months with this new company structure, Bommer began creating her newest work SEPIA. The piece departs from Bommer's signature comedic tone, for a more dramatic work centered around powerfully evolving sea creature characters. SEPIA premiered at the Suzanne Dellal Center for Dance and Theater in 2016, and has since been presented in an immersive adaptation in NYC. In addition to this work, the company continues to tour internationally, with repertory out of NYC and Israel, most recently visiting South Korea, Russia, and Poland. In the US, Bommer has shared her work at Jacob's Pillow on Broadway at The New Victory Theater, and at Battery Dance Festival. Currently the company is a residency artist at Lehman College through the CUNY Dance Initiative, and Bommer continues to spread her contemporary dance technique throughout the world with her choreography, cross continental company, and educational programming in both NYC and Israel.  Technique  Bommer's work as a choreographer and educator centers around her technique The Nadine Bommer Method. This improvisational method is inspired by the endless motion of the sea and split into two core principles: The Body (Kinetica) and The Character (Animato). Kinetica gives dancers a step-by-step process to create a uniquely personal movement language. It cultivates full control of fluid, malleable, and expansive movement using kinetic energy and internal listening. In Bommer's character work (Animato) this liquidity is used to develop a new, but equally expressive, physicality dependent upon the dancer's belief in their transformation to a new being. Characterization in her choreographic work has ranged from soccer players to marionettes to inanimate objects like a lamp and more. A third branch of the technique, Nevet, brings this method to classical technique, focusing an inward attention to the structure of ballet. Nevet was the initial iteration of the method codified in 1994, and is still used as an anchoring entry point in the process of pairing the imagination and internal listening with the body. The full method is taught in Bommer's school, Nadine Bommer Dance Academy, as well as 15 dance schools across Israel including Kibbutzim College of Education Dance Theatre. The company also offers a training program for professional dancers in both NYC and Israel.  Repertoire  Manimation (2007) - Manimation presents a cartoon depiction of comedic situations in a coffee shop. With music by Meredith Monk, the stage transforms into a colorful, Cartoon-like world, where a new experience of dance is created. American Cinema (2009) - American Cinema is a theatrical dance comedy exploring the nuances of cinematic experience through diverse characters in two parts. In part one marionettes react to a film through their operator's point of view. Later, in part two, people translate the puppets' responses into human reactions, offering a second depiction of the emotions brought out in the movie going experience. Invisi'BALL (2010) - Invisi’BALL transforms a cast of female dancers into two teams of ultra-competitive male soccer players. With popular chants and roaring crowds, this unique theater- dance piece illustrates a surprising, hilarious, and multi-cultural mash-up of the game from the moment the audience arrives at the theater. Poodle It (2013) - The glory days of a barber shop come back to life in the memories of a Poodles Barber who has fallen from grace. On stage a mix of animal, inanimate and human characters, to tell his story in an innovative, humorous and fascinating dance theater work. SEPIA (2016) - Sepia is a 60-minute contemporary dance work depicting imaginatively evolved creatures who merge the past, present, and future with their powerful presence. Journeying through a world of their own creation, these creatures display a feminine strength, ability to change, and inherent danger through the signature Nadine Bommer movement language.

She has photographed celebrated dancers in the U.S. and India. Venturing extensively to reveal and evidence the treasures of her subjects, India has captivated her focus since 2003 and inspired the publication of two books: Dance of the Weave, Penguin Books India (2013), and Within Without: The Path of the Yogi, HarperCollins India (2017).  Early life  Born and raised in San Francisco, she has a BFA in photography from the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. She began her career as an intern for photographer Annie Leibovitz, where she worked for three years as a research and production assistant on Women, Leibovitz's book with Susan Sontag. She continued as a producer for the book, Talking Fashion, by Sarajane Hoare and produced advertisements for Conde Nast Magazines and other clients including J Crew, Calvin Klein and Apple.  Career  Based in New York at the beginning of her career, she spent twelve years photographing contemporary dance as a freelance dance photographer for the New York Times and Dance Magazine. Dance and dance- like movements along with fabrics and weaving were among her chosen photographic subjects early on. She documented many celebrated dancers in the U.S. such as Merce Cunningham Dance Company, Elizabeth Streb, Larry Keigwin, and Shen Wei. In 2003 she travelled to India to study Ashtanga Yoga, with Sri K. Pattabhi Jois. \\"That was the beginning of my great love for India.\\" In 2008, she began to pursue work for her book Dance of the Weave, a 208 page compilation which spans five years of shooting in India. In pursuit of her subject, Blasko visited villages where many traditional dance and martial art forms originated as well as many weaving villages, photographing the dancer's interaction with fabric through movement. She reveals the colorful and intricate world of India's treasured textile traditions such as Kancheepuram silk and cotton, Ponduru khadi, Muga silk, and Varanasi silk, and Sambalpuri, Gadwal, and Pochampalli saris. Through work with dance companies such as Nrityagram, and acclaimed dancers Mrinalini Sarabhai, Priyadarshini Govind, Madhavi Mudghal, and Navtej Johar, she elaborates the regionally cherished dance forms of Bharatnatyam, Kathakali, Manipuri, Odissi, Kuchipudi, Kathak, Mohiniyattam, and Sattriya, as well as martial arts forms Chhau, Kalaripayattu, and Pung Cholom. In the forward to the book, fashion designer Donna Karan writes, \\"The loveliness of her images in the book you are holding resides in their ability to share the restless conversation between body and fabric.\\" \\"If you belong to a culture where the sensual pleasure of adjusting long yards of cloth to the contours of your own body are lost to you, perhaps you may revel in this other world. If you live on this side of the planet where these are simple everyday necessities, then you may delight in those photographs that go beyond the brief as it were.\\" Nest, a well respected non- profit working for the social and economic advancement of global artisans, partnered with her to showcase the master craftspeople behind India's textile traditions, to counter the trend of dissolving interest in traditional practices due to increased mechanization. Says Blasko, \\"By highlighting the drapes that are used in dance, I try to show how even a single piece of cloth can hold a sacred position in India.\\" Accustomed to venturing to remote villages to establish her subject, Blasko began a four year project for Within Without: The Path of the Yogi, a voyage through India and Nepal where she gained access to the everyday lives of monks, saints, and priests, gurus, and spiritual seekers. Says Blasko, “While I was with these gurus, some of their practices were so intimate, so precious, that I decided not to take out my camera and risk becoming obtrusive. In photography, if you don’t take a picture it’s as if the event did not happen, but there seems to be a part of me that believes that sometimes not taking a picture is just as valuable.” Her photographs give an intimate glimpse into various spiritual cultures including Jain monks, Tibetan lamas, Sufis, Catholic priests, and yoga practitioners. From Pico Iyer's preface: “What moves me in Briana Blasko’s quiet, unintrusive photographs — as in her soulful and beautifully lucid Preface — is her readiness to follow India into the silent places where truly its energy lives. You’ll see how everyday are the places and exchanges she’s brought back out into the world, and how these white-clad yogis can carry their sense of stillness and purity into the heart of a noisy city.” Blasko deliberately chose not to arrange the subjects by religious faith. Says Blasko, \\"During the time I spent with yogis of different spiritual persuasions, I realised that there is an innate sameness in their practices that transcends the confines of religion.\\"  Bibliography  Dance of the Weave, Penguin Books India (2013) Within Without: The Path of the Yogi, HarperCollins India (2017) References  External links  * Category:Living people Category:American women photographers Category:American portrait photographers Briana Blasko Category:Photographers from California Category:Tisch School of the Arts alumni Category:Dance photographers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Briana Blasko"},{"id":"54993949","text":"The Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority (PPDA) is a parastatal organisation in Uganda that is responsible for regulation and supervision of procurement and disposal of government-owned property and other assets.

Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and puritanical constraints, and centres on his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, even to the point of owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values. His political activity is informed by the same ethos, as indicated by his repudiation of communism after his 1936 voyage to the USSR.

It has been owned by the Collet family since 1827. Its current owner is former Danish Defence Minister Bernt Johan Collet. The Neoclassical main building form 1915 was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 6 July 1918. History Lundbygård has existed since the Middle Ages. The first known owner is Niels Olufsen who was the owner in 1355. It was acquired by Peder Sten in the 1480s and stayed in his family for several generations. His grandson, Knud Steensen, sold it to a widow, Anne Nielsdatter Lunge, who ceded it to the Crown in exchange for Kronen mod om 1577. The Crown made the estate available to various powerful men. In 1661, Svend Poulsen was granted it for life in appreciation of his role in the Swedish Wars and five years later he received it as his personal property. Shortly thereafter he sold it to be able to pay his debts. The buyer was Christian Sivertsen who sold it to Knud Gregersen. The property had at this point fallen into disrepair and was in 1685 again acquired by the Crown. In 1584, Lundbygård was acquired by Johan Henrik Schmidt, who was at the National Regiment on Zealand. His widow, Maren Pedersdatter, sold it to Hector Gottfried Masius in 1705. His son, Christian von der Maase, sold it to the Crown in 1719. It was then included in Vordingborg Rytterdistrikt. The cavalry districts was sold in auction in 1774. Vordingborg Rytterdistrikt was divided into 12 manors of which Lundbygård was one of them. It was acquired by Caspar Wilhelm von Munthe of Morgenstierne. He constructed new farm buildings and a brickyard on the estate. In 1786, he sold Lundbygård to Adam Gottlob Wiimh. who later published a handbook for farmers. In 1811, he sold the estate to Ulrik Christian von Schmidten who was succeeded by Jobst Gerhard von Scholten. It was for a while again owned by the state before it was ceded to Peter Nicolaj Arbo. In 1804, he had moved from Drammen in Norway to Copenhagen where he ran a major timber trading company. His widow Anne Cathrine Collett took over the estate after his death in 1827 and owned it until her death in 1846. The couple had no children and she therefore left it to her nephew Bent Anker Collet. He constructed new farm building and improved both the fields and the management of the forests. His son Peter Ferdinand Collet inherited Lundbygård in 1857. He sold off most of the tenant farms. Architecture The main building dates from 1815 and is designed in the Neoclassical style. It originally consisted of a two-storey main wing flanked by two detached side wings placed in an angle to create a symmetrical fan-shape. The three central bays of the main wing are decorated with pilasters and is tipped by a triangular pediment. The two side wings were attached to the main wing in connection with an adaption carried out by Gotfred Tvede in 1910. He also removed the original main entrance and staircase in the central axis of the main wing. The original main entrance was restored in connection with another adaption of the building carried out by the architect Mogens og Peter Koch in 1943. To the south of the main building is a large courtyard and a complex of farm buildings. It comprises a large barn from 1777 which was converted into an equestrian house in 1843. The rest of the farm buildings were destroyed by two fires in 1909 and 1928. The new farm buildings date from after the fire in 1923 and from 1977. Park The garden is located to the north of the main building. A garden in French style was created by Caspar Wilhelm von Munthe of Morgenstierne. The garden was redesigned by professor C.Th. Sørensen between 1941 and 1968. It contains many large trees as well as a swimming pool. Today The estate is today owned by Bernt Johan Collet. It covers 1000 hectares of which 400 hectares are farmland and 600 hectares are woodland. It is the largest grower of Christmas trees in Europe. Lundbygård contains a small museum with artifacts found on the estate. It is only open on Constitution Day (5 June).

He played college football for the Missouri Tigers after previously playing for the Clemson Tigers. He was undrafted in the 2020 NFL Draft. Early years Bryant attended Wren High School in Piedmont, South Carolina. As a senior, he had 3,579 passing yards with 41 passing touchdowns, 720 rushing yards, and 14 rushing touchdowns. He committed to Clemson University to play college football under head coach Dabo Swinney. During Bryant's junior year of high school, he was unable to play in the first half of a game, as he was vomiting blood in the locker room. Bryant was taken to the hospital and after an MRI, doctors found a large abscess blocking his lower intestine. Had this abscess not been found, it may have burst, leading to a life-threatening infection in his entire body. Doctors were successfully able to remove the abscess through an emergency surgery. College career =Clemson= Bryant spent his first two years at Clemson as a backup to Deshaun Watson. During the two years, he completed 13 of 19 passes for 75 yards with a touchdown and interception. He also had 178 rushing yards over 35 carries with three touchdowns. During this time, Clemson would win both the 2015 and 2016 ACC Championships, as well as the 2017 CFP National Championship. After Watson left for the 2017 NFL Draft, Bryant was named Clemson's starting quarterback to open the 2017 season. Bryant led the Tigers to the 2017 ACC Championship, and a spot in the 2017 College Football Playoff, losing to eventual national champion Alabama in the Sugar Bowl. The 2017 Clemson Tigers finished the season with a record of 12–2. On September 25, 2018, after week 4 of the 2018 season, coach Dabo Swinney announced that freshman Trevor Lawrence would be the new starting quarterback for the Tigers. As a result, Bryant decided to transfer. He maintained his final year of eligibility, despite starting 4 games of his senior year, due to a recent change in NCAA redshirt guidelines. The Tigers would go on to win the 2019 CFP Championship. Due to Bryant's decision to leave the team early in the season, Swinney chose not to give Bryant a championship ring. =Missouri= On December 5, 2018, Bryant announced that he would transfer to Missouri. The following year he became a quarterback for the 2019 Missouri Tigers. In the Tigers' first game of the 2019 season, a 31–37 loss at Wyoming, Bryant threw a career-high 423 yards. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2020 NFL Draft, Bryant had a tryout with the Arizona Cardinals on August 14, 2020.

It airs weekdays at 6 PM ET. In its first full year on air in 2018, The Beat drew the \\"largest audience for MSNBC at 6pm in the network’s history.\\" In 2019, The Beat broke that record. The Beat's audience is larger than The Situation Room, which airs on CNN in the same timeslot, \\"by a wide margin when it comes to total viewers,\\" drawing about 700,000 more viewers per night, according to Nielsen ratings analyzed by the media website The Cheat Sheet in 2019. The Beat is also one of the most viewed news shows online, drawing \\"around 13 million viewers per month on YouTube—the highest of any MSNBC show,\\" according to a 2019 Daily Beast profile.  Format  The show features news reporting, one-on-one interviews, panels, and special reports by the anchor. The show includes a \\"Fallback Friday\\" segment every Friday.  History  The Beat with Ari Melber was announced after Greta Van Susteren's program For the Record with Greta ended. The network tapped Melber as one of its \\"most valuable utility players\\" for anchoring the 6pm slot, according to the Associated Press, an effort to shore up an hour when MSNBC has historically drawn less viewers, trailing cable stars Bret Baier and Wolf Blitzer, who host the 6 p.m. shows on Fox News and CNN. Upon its debut, it was part of MSNBC's evening ratings surge among key demographics on cable television, and went on to draw a larger nightly audience than any hour of CNN. The Beat with Ari Melber has been noted for its reporting on Facebook's role in elections and journalism. Mediaite, an American Media publication, wrote about its coverage of Facebook's role in the Philippines election, noting \\"host Ari Melber has carved out an important niche as arguably the leading critic of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in all of television.\\" Notable interviews Melber has conducted include U.S. Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Jeff Merkel, Richard Blumenthal, Dick Durbin, Mark Warner and Cory Booker; Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had a newsworthy legal exchange on the show, former White House adviser Stephen Bannon, former Trump aide Sam Nunberg, who later credited the interview for his decision to cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and musician Talib Kweli, who joined a discussion with Fat Joe and conservative Bill Kristol that Fortune called \\"one of the most delightfully diverse panels ever. Really.\\" The show also features musical and cultural guests, such as 50 Cent, Method Man, Vic Mensa, French Montana, Black Panther actor Winston Duke, Sean Penn, novelist Alice Walker, Andrew Leon Talley, DJs Stretch Armstrong, Bobbito Garcia and Jay Smooth, Desus and The Kid Mero (who both co-host Desus & Mero), and the rapper Havoc, (who noted Melber quoted his lyrics to explain a legal concept and announced a forthcoming Mobb Deep album in an interview on the show).

He plays as a defender for the Solomon Warriors in the Telekom S-League, for the Solomon Islands national football team, the Solomon Islands national futsal team and the Solomon Islands national beach soccer team. Club career Despite having successfully made his mark in beach soccer and Futsal, Laua find it quit difficult to make the 11 a-side breakthrough. Laua joined Koloale FC Honiara pre-season trainings in 2009 but could not make the first team until 2013. After four years of waiting, he finally earned his place in the first team in the season 2013-2014. In the following season Laua was deployed as main forward for the young Koloale side. Laua's main strengths lies on his speed and attacking abilities as he is a more natural winger. Laua joined Marist from local rival Koloale at the beginning of the season 2015-2016 and become one of the first new arrivals when Brazilian coach Juilano Schmeling first arrived to lead Marist. Once Laua found his rhythm, he never looked back. His energy and quickness of thought soon shown throughout the season. His first season with Marist was incredible as he featured in all competitive fixtures heading Marist attacking front. The newly reformed Marist side ended the season on 3rd position on the league table. 2016-2017 was a memorable season for Marist FC as the club eventually become champions of Telekom S-League. Despite being labelled as Marist' most successful season, Robert Laua faced a difficult situation in the mid-season. He was slowly recovering from a major injury he got during the Futsal World cup warm up. Laua couldn't make instant impact after recovering from his injury, also there's stiff competition on his preferred position (left midfield) which reduced his opportunities in the first team. Laua had never played as a left back in his entire career, however prior to Marist's OFC Champions League campaign in early 2017, the club realised that they had only one natural left back in the team, the Papua New Guinea international Koriak Upaiga, and there's was a need for a back-up left- back. That was the very moment that Marist Coach Schmeling opted to try him at the left back position. During the OFC Champions League campaign, he was introduced as substitute on the left-back position in all 3 group matches. In the summer of 2018 he transferred to the Solomon Warriors. International career =Beach Soccer= Robert Laua has started his playing career as a beach soccer player. He was part of the Solomon Islands national beach soccer team, commonly known as the ‘Bilikiki’ from 2009 to 2013. At the age of just 17 in 2009, Robert Laua has his beach soccer career whole ahead of him where he has proved his incredible talent at the 2009 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup in Dubai. It was a memorable World Cup debut for the 17 year old as his stunning hat trick helped Solomon Islands upset the South American giants Uruguay 7-6. The 2013 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup was yet another milestone in his career. He played a key role in a 2-0 win over the Netherlands in the group stages and also managed to score against Argentina and El Salvador. =Futsal= After the 2011 Oceanian Futsal Championship in Fiji, Laua decided to put his focus on futsal. He attended the Kurukuru futsal trainings who were preparing for the 2012 FIFA Futsal World Cup at that time. He was one of those new players who joined the training squad, competing with the star studded Kurukuru side for a spot in the final team. However, after months of World Cup build up, Laua unfortunately didn't make the final cut, he was included in the non- travelling list. Laua then turned his focus on the 2016 FIFA Futsal World Cup in Colombia. He trained with the team under the guidance of new Brazilian coach Juliano Schmeling who was also his coach with Marist. Laua was in the Kurukuru team that successfully won the 2016 OFC Futsal Championship. Laua was included in the Kurukuru's World Cup team, who went on to play warm-up matches against the futsalroos and against Brazil, however while in Brazil just weeks before world cup, Laua had a serious injury which ruled him out for the rest of the tournament. Laua called this moment 'the saddest moment in my life' =Football= Laua's inclusion to the national team came as a surprise to many including previous managers who led the national team as no one expected him to be head coach Felipe Vera-Arango first choice. Laua made his debut on May 25, 2017 in a 1-1 draw against Fiji.

He was the co-founder of the Interstate Theaters Company, a chain of vaudeville theaters (later movie theaters), now a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. He was the first theater owner to add air conditioning to movie theaters in the United States, and the first to add sound in the Southwest. He also helped support the construction of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Early life Karl Hoblitzelle was born on October 22, 1879 in St. Louis, Missouri. His father, Clarence Linden Hoblitzelle, was a veteran of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. His mother was Ida Adelaide Knapp. His maternal grandfather, Colonel George Knapp, was the founder of the Missouri Gazette, later known as the Missouri Republican and finally the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. He eventually had nine brothers and three sisters. Hoblitzelle was of Swiss, Austrian and English descent on his paternal side and of Irish, English and French descent on his maternal side. His ancestors were settlers who fought in the American Revolutionary War. His paternal great-grandfather, Samuel Ogle was the Governor of Maryland. Hoblitzelle graduated from high school in St. Louis, but his parents could not afford to send him to college. Career Hoblitzelle began his career working in real estate for his uncle; he worked in a soap factory, and later sold vegetables grown on his family farm as a market trader. He subsequently worked at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904. The Majestic Theater in Dallas, Texas Hoblitzelle met Edward McMechin, a businessman who suggested he invest in vaudeville theaters, in 1904. By 1905, Hoblitzelle and his brother George K. co-founded the Interstate Theaters Company. The company operated vaudeville theaters in Texas, although it was headquartered in Missouri. It later became a chain of movie theaters. One of them was the Majestic Theatre in Dallas; another was the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio. More theaters were opened in Fort Worth, Waco and Houston as well as Shreveport, Louisiana, Birmingham, Alabama, Little Rock, Arkansas, and Wichita, Kansas. Hoblitzelle sold the company to RKO Pictures in 1930; however, he purchased it again in 1933. During World War II, Hoblitzelle worked with the United States Army to show patriotic films in his theaters. In 1951, Hoblitzelle sold the company to United Paramount (later known as American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, followed by Capital Cities/ABC Inc., now a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company). However, he \\"retained management rights in 165 theaters\\". Hoblitzelle was the first to add sound to movie theaters in the Southwest (1930), and the first in the United States to add air conditioning (1922). Hoblitzelle was also the chairman of Hoblitzelle Properties, a real estate conglomerate, and the Republic National Bank. Philanthropy and civic activities Hoblitzelle founded the Hoblitzelle Foundation in 1942. He was the founder of the Texas Heritage Foundation, a non-profit organization for the promotion of Texan culture. He also served on the boards of the Dallas Art Association, the Dallas Symphony Society, and the Dallas Grand Opera Association. Additionally, he co-founded the Southwestern Medical Foundation, which supported the construction of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. Hoblitzelle was the chairman of the Hockaday School, a private academy in Dallas. He also served on the executive committee of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, on the board of directors of Texas Tech University in Lubbock, and on the board of trustees of Texas A&M; University in College Station. He also made charitable contributions to the University of Texas. Personal life and death Hoblitzelle married Esther Thomas, later known as Esther Walker, a singer who predeceased him in 1943. They resided in Dallas, Texas. Hoblitzelle died on March 8, 1967 in Dallas. His funeral was held at the Park Cities Baptist Church, and he was buried in the Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.

It will consist of two skyscrapers, a smaller residential tower, a low-rise office building, a hotel, and a low-rise retail building. Site preparation began in late 2015, and construction officially commenced on January 24, 2017. Construction is planned to last until 2020 on the residential tower. The high-rise office tower, One Congress, will start construction in 2019 and will open in 2022. One Congress Tower under construction, 2019 The primary building of the development is the 43-story office tower, which will feature a three-story lobby and high-end amenities. The first four floors of the building will contain the lobby and a restaurant, with each floor containing 23,200 square feet. Floors five through ten will contain offices and parking, and each floor will contain 8,800 square feet. The remaining floors will contain offices, and each floor will contain 27,500 square feet. The building is planned to earn a gold level of certification through the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification program. Some preliminary construction on the building is underway, but no major construction will begin until an anchor tenant is found. As in summer of 2018, developers of One Congress & Bulfinch Crossing have announced on Bulfinch Crossing's Twitter that construction will finally start One Congress in summer of 2019 and also announced that it will be opening in 2022. In January 2019, State Street Corporation was announced to be the primary tenant in the new building.https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/01/23/state-street-new- deal-jumpstart-government-center-garage- project/Tgjr1yyEVDs8hiLQ25F76M/story.html?event=event25 The building will contain a fitness center, basketball court, rooftop garden, and several conference rooms. On-site parking is also available. Residential Tower The second largest building in the development is the larger residential tower (sometimes called Residential Tower I by the developer), which is planned to be at least tall. The tower was originally planned to consist of 486 apartments, but will now instead contain only 368 apartments and 55 condos. This change was announced in July 2017 when the developer decided to convert 118 apartments into 55 condos due to a slowing demand for luxury housing in Boston. The residential tower will contain a fitness center, swimming pool, rooftop garden, clubroom, private kitchen and diner, yoga room, golf simulator, pet spa, concierge services and a sky lounge and terrace. On-site parking is also available. Other buildings Along with the two main towers of the development, four smaller buildings and a public square will be constructed. Along with these buildings, there will be nearly in the entire development. =Residential Tower II= A smaller residential tower (officially named Residential Tower II), is being constructed alongside the rest of the development. It is planned to rise at least and contain 28 stories. The tower is planned to be primarily residential, with 291 units. At least of the building will be designated for retail use. =Boutique Office= In addition to the main office tower, a smaller office building (officially named Boutique Office) is under construction; it is planned to contain at least of both office and retail space. The building will rise and will contain 11 stories. It is planned to have a private terrace for office workers. =Retail building= A retail building (officially named Iconic Retail) is planned to be constructed as part of the development project; it is planned to be situated across the street from the Boston Public Market and will contain four floors. The building is intended to house a flagship store, and will include an entrance to the Haymarket Square subway station. =Hotel= A tall hotel building is being constructed at the northern edge of the site, and is planned to contain at least 200 hotel rooms.

Amenities The hotel is planned to contain a ballroom, several meeting rooms, a rooftop bar, and a rooftop terrace. Parking garage The Government Center garage will be mostly demolished, but over 1,000 spaces will remain as part of the new development. In order to make room for the new development, the existing Government Center garage will be demolished. The garage was constructed in the 1960s as part of the Government Center urban renewal project; it contains 2,300 parking spaces. Due to the fact that the garage is entirely made out of concrete, it is considered to be an eyesore by many, along with the nearby City Hall building. At least 1,160 parking spaces in the garage are to be preserved to accommodate the new development, the spaces are planned to be placed inside of the new office tower.

He escaped Henry Morgan and sailed with Jan Willems for several years. Biography =Early piracy= Evertson captured a brigantine near Jamaica in early 1681. Famed buccaneer Henry Morgan had become the Lieutenant Governor and dispatched a ship to capture Evertson’s sloop and his mixed Spanish-English crew. Morgan’s men mounted a stealthy midnight attack, surprising the pirates and capturing their ships. Evertson and a number of his crew jumped ship and attempted to swim to safety. Morgan published accounts of the capture for the public; he announced that Evertson and the other escapees had been shot and killed as they tried to swim away. Captured Spanish sailors were deported to Cartagena; the English prisoners were tried, convicted of piracy, and hung. Morgan kept Evertson’s sloop, using it as a scout for his frigate. =Another ship= In fact Evertson had survived the escape and continued his piratical career. Obtaining another ship, he partnered with fellow Dutch pirate Jan “Yankey” Willems, sailing together. After several years at sea they sailed to South Carolina in 1687 - possibly to retire or seek a pardon, though unsuccessfully - and soon returned to Jamaica. There they wrote to Governor Molesworth in September asking for a pardon. He welcomed them and offered a pardon on condition that Yankey and Evertson dismantle their ships to keep them from returning to piracy. At the time Yankey had a 40-gun 100-man Dutch ship while Evertson sailed a 26-gun, 50-man barque. Despite many of their men having deserted, the two pirates refused to destroy their ships, pleading with Molesworth, “We beg you to consider that if our ships are broken up we shall be left destitute of all livelihood in present and future, and to allow us the use of them. We have neither of us money to purchase an estate ashore.” Molesworth repeated his demand, and the pirates sailed away. =Larger crew= Their crews bolstered by sailors picked up from Jean Hamlin’s crew (and possibly Joseph Bannister’s), the pair continued piracy. Partnering with Laurens de Graaf, Michel de Grammont, and other buccaneers, they took part in sacking Cartagena in 1683. Yankey, presumably with Evertson, captured a rich Spanish vessel off Havana in 1686. In early 1688 they attacked a Spanish “urca” cargo ship near Puerto Cavallos. After an eight-hour battle they captured it; Yankey may have taken it as his own. =Possible death= Though it is not recorded how or where they perished, by August 1688 both Yankey and Evertson were reported dead. At least one source reported Evertson still alive at Santo Domingo the following year, dying in 1695 in English service. Their remaining crew members signed on with Captain Peterson.

As a result, many scenic cliffs are scattered along the west coast, with the most notable being the . =Settlements and administrative units= *Kashima, Kagoshima *Shimokoshiki, Kagoshima ** ** ** ** ** History The site of the island was initially elevated in the Cretaceous period about 80 million years before present. The sites housing dinosaur fossils are located across the island, which together with scenic cliffs propelled the island to the list. In historical records, Shimokoshiki- jima is first mentioned during the Nara period when it was populated by the Satsuma tribe of the Hayato people. The island was incorporated into Japan by the early Heyan period though. The island belonged to the Christian domain during Nanboku trade period and 35 people were executed in the aftermath of the Shimabara rebellion in 1638. During the Great Tenmei famine in the 178x period, a large group of inhabitants of Shimokoshiki-jima migrated to Kanoya, Kagoshima. A second wave of migration in 1887–1897, driven by famine, typhoon- related destruction and epidemics, departed to Tanegashima. Regular communications with the mainland by means of telegraph and scheduled ship service began in 1901. The direct passage of typhoon Ruth over the island again brought severe damage, and the population, which peaked in 1950 at 13,578 people, started to rapidly decline, with over half of inhabitants of the island departing within 20 years. Modern Shimokoshiki-jima is primarily a fishing island, with 10.9% of population being fishermen as of 2009. Transportation Shimokoshiki-jima is connected to Nakakoshiki-jima and through it to Kamikoshiki-jima, by a bridge and two connecting tunnels at Nakakoshiki-jima. This bridge opened on 29 August 2020 after over 9 years of construction. Ferry lines also connect Shimokoshiki-jima to Kamikoshiki-jima and to Ichikikushikino city on the Kyushu mainland, the latter offering two daily round-trips. On the island, transportation is provided by public buses operating four routes. Some routes need a prior reservation due to the small number of passengers.

It is represented by the type species Serikornis sungei. Discovery Serikornis, first described in August 2017, is noteworthy for the variety of feather types represented in its holotype, a single complete articulated skeleton preserved on a slab along with extensive integumentary structures. The specimen's feather imprints include wispy bundles along the neck, short and symmetrical vaned feathers on the arms, and both fuzz and long pennaceous feathers on its hindlimbs. While its anatomy and integument share features with birds as well as derived dromaeosaurs such as Microraptor, cladistic analysis places the genus within the cluster of feathered dinosaurs near the origin of avians. It was unlikely to be a flier. Its name means \\"Ge Sun's silk bird\\", a reference to the plumulaceous-like body covering evident in the fossil. The specimen's nickname, \\"Silky\\", refers to the striking resemblance of the delicate hindlimb filaments to the modern Silky breed of domestic chicken. Description Life restoration by Emily Willoughby The skeletal morphology of Serikornis suggests a terrestrial ecology without flying adaptations. The tail is covered proximally by filaments and distally by fine rectrices. Symmetrical, barbule- free remiges are attached along the forelimbs and elongated feathers of the hind limbs extend to the toes, suggesting that the remiges of the hind legs had evolved in the maniraptorans residing on the ground before being co-opted to an arboreal lifestyle and possibly, gliding. The coracoid of Serikornis is devoid of diagnostic ornamentation present in Anchiornis but is distinguished by having the tuberculous coracoid elongated to form a crest. The postacetabular blade of the ilium (bone) is stouter and more squared than in Anchiornis but less robust and quadrangular than in Aurornis. The ischium does not show the particular dorsocaudally straight morphology that is proper of Aurornis, and has a narrow and unciform process. Serikornis is further distinguished by having very large anterior most maxillary teeth, about twice as long as the others. Since the skeleton compressed on a plane, Lefèvre and colleagues have used a new microscan technique called luminography to identify the pneumatic cavity in the vertebrae: the cervical vertebrae have a small pneumatic cavity, which is a derived condition shared by many other coelurosaurian theropods. Classification A phylogenetic analysis by Lefèvre et al. (2017) places Serikornis, along with other late Jurassic paravians from China, as basal Paraves, outside Eumaniraptora. In the 2017 description of Halszkaraptor from Cau et al. (2017), who incorporate the a large-scale phylogenetic matrix in their study placed Serikornis in the newly described family Anchiornithidae, still being grouped with Eosinopteryx.

Renard did not have a secondary education, but opened a small garage in Douai in 1967. He built a three-wheeled microcar in his spare time, which gained the attention of a local newspaper. This led to an order of another car by a reader, and the company was born. Series production began in 1978, after the company had moved to bigger premises in the nearby town of Aniche. In 1979 nearly 2400 vehicles were built, while in 1980 employees built 2640. Production came to and end in 1997 (after company funds had been misappropriated by a manager), when Savel (also located in Aniche) bought the company. In total, about 30,000 ERADs were built, of which 800 were electrical vehicles. Models ERAD's first model was the Capucine, a plastic-bodied single-seater. It was long, wide, tall, and weighed . There was an improved model which had almost the same body but with a wider track of . The vehicle was equipped with a two-stroke, 47 cc single- cylinder engine from Sachs. There were two types: front wheel drive and rear wheel drive. The FWD had a controversial Motobécane 50-cc two-stroke engine with a contra piston working as a crankcase compressor, enabling lower engine speeds but more torque. There was seating for two people and a boot which could be used for shopping or other modest baggage. In 1981 this was joined by a 123 cc engine from BCB and a 290 cc diesel engine from Farymann. There was also a handicap version of the Capucine, where the rear of the car was made up of a large door which swung to the side, allowing wheelchair entry via a small ramp. Later, 360 cc Petters AC1 diesels were installed. The Capucine was facelifted in 1984 and gained a convertible model as well as a four-seater. ERAD Midget at the Emirates National Auto Museum ERAD Junior In 1982 the ERAD Midget appeared, a long replica of the 1936 MG Midget, weighing in at . It has live, leaf-sprung axles front and rear, and drum brakes all around. A 125 cc two-stroke petrol engine or a 600 cc diesel unit were available, but only 24 were built. In 1988 the ERAD Junior appeared, a new low-price using the headlights from the Peugeot 205. The eye-catching Junior only has one forward- folding door, a large unit which includes the roof of the car. Next followed the 1990 Spacia, similar in appearance to the Renault Twingo. This was available with diesel engines of up to 505 cc or an electrical motor. ERAD's last new car was the two-seat Agora, presented in 1993. End of production After ERAD suffered financial troubles due to managerial misconduct, Renard started a new company in 1995, called SECMA. Soon thereafter the ERAD factory was sold to the newly created Savel company (in 1997). Savel was itself liquidated in 2002, and Renard was able to buy back most of his old firm, reincorporating it into SECMA. External links SECMA's website, Daniel Renard's current company.

'Back Ground to Special Economic Zones of India' Govt. of India with a view to attract investment, promote exports, generate large scale employment and economic activity has formulated the SEZ Policy. After the enactment of the SEZ policy, in the year 2005 by Govt. of India, major multinational companies, a number of State Governments, and large-scale domestic players have come forward for setting up of SEZs in the Country. SEZs are basically-  A designated duty-free enclaves  No license required for import of Capital Goods or Raw Materials  Manufacturing, trading & Service activities allowed  100% FDI allowed under automatic route (except prohibited sectors)  The only criteria is SEZ units have to be a positive net foreign exchange earner SEZ – Minimum Area requirements Multi Product : 500 hectares Sector specific : 50 hectares Free Trade & Warehousing : 40 hectares Food & Agri based Product SEZs : 10 hectares Bio Tech or Health Services : No minimum land requirement other than Hospital) Min. built-up processing area requirement for setting up is as given below IT/ITES : No minimum requirement of Land prescribed. Minimum Built-up space norms (City Wise) : Cat-A : 50,000 Sq. Mts. : Cat-B : 25,000 Sq. Mts : Cat-C : 15,000 Sq. Mts. The minimum processing area in any Special Economic Zone cant be less than 50% of total area of the SEZ. All existing notified SEZs are deemed to be a multi-sector SEZ History of VEPZ (Presently Visakhapatnam Special Economic Zone) The zone originated in 1989, and is the last one to be set up in the country, after the countrys first SEZ was set up in Kandla in 1965, when it was named as VEPZ (Visakhpatnam Export Processing Zone). It was changed to the Visakapatnam Special Economic Zone on 1 January 2003. The zone comprises of an area of 360.5 acres. The Development Commissioner, the administrative head of the zone, is also the head of all 60 special economic zones in Andhra Pradesh,Telangana, Chhattisgarh and the union territory of Yanam.

The Trading sheds are allotted on lease basis initially for a period of five years and extendable thereafter. iv. Power Infrastructure: VSEZ Authority has allotted 5 acres of vacant land to APEPDCL, Govt. of Andhra Pradesh for erection of a sub-station in VSEZ. APEPDCL has erected a 132/33 KVA Sub-station in the VSEZ premises to cater to the power requirement of the units in the VSEZ. The load requirements i.e., HT power or LT power requirement is very well augmented by the power sub-station. The units in the VSEZ are assured of reliable power supply round the clock, the power failures are very minimal. The Zone has provided the power infrastructure to the doorstep of the unit i.e., laying of power cables, erection of electricity poles, street lighting, erection of towers, transformers etc. The units have to apply to the APEPDCL for power connection and the power consumption charges are directly paid to the APEPDC Limited. v. Water Supply System: VSEZ Authority has created a very modern water pumping system to supply water to all the units in the zone at a very competitive price. The treated water is drawn from Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation and pumped with heavy duty motors to the Over Head Tanks. As the zone has been developed in three phases as Phase-I, Phase-II and Phase-III, the pump houses are constructed at important points to pump the water to designated OHTs for supply to the units.The water is supplied through the Pump Houses and gravity. The water network and supply system is so robust that there is no line losses or leakage or pilferage of water at any given point of time. The pipelines are laid upto the door step of the unit, the unit set up in vacant land have to lay the internal piping. All the units are provided Water Meters and the consumption charges are collected as per the consumption with transparency and accuracy. A dedicated water supply maintenance team is available round the clock for operating the motors and to attend any maintenance call. vi.

She was called Angel in Hell by the patients she helped during her stay in Gurs internment camp from October 1940 to August 1942. Family Johanna Geissmar was the youngest of six children of lawyer Josef Geissmar (16 October 1828 in Sinsheim - 3 October 1905 in Mannheim) and his wife Klara née Regensburger (20 April 1844 in Eppingen - 16 July 1911). Her ancestors included cantors and religious teachers. Her grandfather was David Geismar, the Rabbi of Sinsheim. Life Johanna Geissmar went to a Lyceum in Mannheim. Studying at a university was out of the question then, as the universities were still closed for women. When Heidelberg University in 1900 started to admit women, Johanna decided to complete her secondary education and to obtain the Abitur at the Hohenbaden castle in Baden-Baden. In 1909 she began to study medicine in Heidelberg. During this time, she lived with her brother Jakob Geissmar, a judge, in Graimbergweg 1. She graduated in 1915 and then worked as a doctor in a hospital in Heidelberg. She was confronted with heavy injuries of soldiers of the First World War. From 1920 she practiced as a pediatrician in Heidelberg, first in Erwin-Rhode-Straße, later in Moltkestraße, where she also lived. From 1930, fewer and fewer patients came to Johanna Geissmar as a result of Nazi propaganda. On 1 April 1933 the Gauleitung called for the boycott of Jewish doctors. At the end of April 1933, Johanna Geissmar was deprived of her license and she had to close her practice. After 28 August 1933, Johanna Geissmar moved to Bärental in the Black Forest. From 1935 she lived in Saig bei Lenzkirch. Her brother Friedrich Geissmar, also a physician, came to live with her. After the November Pogrom of 1938, Johanna Geissmar was physically attacked. She found refuge with her friend Erika Schwoerer, whose family was critical toward the Nazi regime. The living conditions of Jews became more and more menacing. Her friend turned to Martin Huss for help, a Protestant priest and member of the Confessing Church. But a protection was not possible. Johanna's brother took his life in the fall of 1940. Johanna Geissmar was arrested by the Gestapo and was brought to one of the collection centers during the Wagner Bürckel Operation on 23 October 1940. Then she was deported to the Gurs internment camp in southern France. There she was interned in the women's camp. Johanna Geissmar and nurse Pauline Maier took care of many sick and fainting patients as the living conditions in the camp were terrible and inhuman. Her tireless work in the camp led to the description Angel in Hell. In August 1942 she was transported to Auschwitz concentration camp. Although her name was not on the list, she joined the transport voluntarily, wanting to continue to care for her patients. She also hoped to find her brother Jakob and his wife, who were deported from Munich, in Auschwitz. The date of her arrival in Auschwitz-Birkenau is also the date of their death: 14 August 1942. None of her siblings survived. Three siblings had already died before 1933. Jakob was murdered in Theresienstadt in 1943, his wife Elisabeth and her daughter Martha also became victims of the Shoah. Two nieces survived: Else Geissmar, the second daughter of Jakob and Elisabeth, emigrated to the US with her daughter Ruth in 1938. Berta Geissmar, the daughter of Leopold, fled to London in time.Initiative Stolpersteine für Heidelberg, description of family Geissmar, retrieved on 20 August 2018  Remembrance  Stolperstein for Johanna Geissmar in Heidelberg A commemorative plaque for Johanna Geissmar can be found on the building Hochfirstweg 25 in Lenzkirch-Saig where she once lived. Its inauguration took place on 30 May 2004. The ZDF film Angel in Hell by Dietmar Schulz premiered on 31 January 2009. It is based entirely on the fate of Johanna Geissmar. In 2013 the school conference of the Peter Petersen Gymnasium in Mannheim-Schönau, a high school, decided to rename the school with her name.Mannheimer Morgen, 7 June 2013, p. 17 Since 2014 a Stolperstein in front of the House Moltkestrasse 6 in Heidelberg serves as a memorial of Johanna Geissmar.

Horse racing Parimutuel wagering on harness racing is permitted at the state's two racetracks, Scarborough Downs in Scarborough and Hollywood Casino Hotel & Raceway in Bangor. Brief harness racing meets of up to nine days each also occur at nine agricultural fairs throughout the state, from July to October, with wagering allowed. Wagering is also offered at four off-track betting parlors around the state. Casinos Maine law allows two casinos: Hollywood Casino in Bangor and Oxford Casino in Oxford. The two casinos had a total annual net gaming revenue of $132 million as of 2016. Slot machines at horse tracks were approved in a statewide referendum in 2003, but were rejected by voters in the city of Scarborough, leading to Bangor having the only permitted casino. The casino in Oxford was approved by a statewide referendum in 2010. The racino law was amended the following year to allow table games at Bangor. Charitable gaming Maine law permits many types of community organizations to conduct various games of chance for fundraising purposes, including bingo (with prizes up to $400), raffles (with prize values up to $75,000), and card games (generally with a maximum bet of $1 per hand). Indian gaming State law permits Maine's four federally recognized tribes to conduct high-stakes bingo games with unlimited prize values. The tribes do not have gaming rights that tribes in other states possess, because the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act subjects the tribes' lands to state law, and excludes the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act from applying in the state.

She is an emeritus professor in the biological sciences at the University of Quebec at Montreal. She is known for her work on gender, environmental health and ergonomics. She was given the Jacques Rousseau Award in 1993, the Governor General's Award in 2009, and was named an Officer of the Order of Canada on Dec.27, 2019 . Life Messing was born in Springfield, Massachusetts in 1943. She studied social sciences at Harvard before deciding to focus on science. She went to McGill University in Montreal where she studied biology, genetics and chemistry. She faced prejudice from colleagues because she was a single mother. She began teaching at University of Quebec at Montreal in 1976 and two years later she was conducting research amongst phosphate workers. She knew of the potential and radioactivity and discovered that amongst six workers, four of them had children with birth defects like a club foot. She did manage to get dust extraction equipment installed but only on the provisp that the researchers left the factory. Messing reflects that this event focused her later work on occupational health. In 1990 she spent a year studying a toilet cleaner named Nina who walked 23 km every day as she cleaned toilets in 1–2 minutes. This work led to recommendations that were adopted and to her specializing in ergonomics and winning an award. She was given the Jacques Rousseau Award in 1993. This award recognises leading Canadians who are working across disciplines. Messing co-founded the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology, Health, Society and the Environment (CINBIOSE) at her university. She has worked for thirty years to also increase opportunities for women. She chaired the committee that advises on gender and ergonomics at the International Association of Ergonomics. In recognition of this she was given the Governor General's Award in 2009 that commemorates the 80th anniversary of the persons case. This was a case where Canadian acknowledged that women were included in the legal phrase of \\"person\\" and were therefore entitled to all those legal rights.  Other awards  She was given the Yant Award in 2014. = Works = # Messing, K.

R. A. Thumboo Chetty (Trichinopoly Rayalu Arakiaswamy Thumboo Chetty; April 1837 - 19 June 1907) became the First Indian Chief Judge of the Chief Court of Mysore, and officiated many times during the absence on leave of the Permanent holder of the office of Dewan, mainly for Sir K. Seshadri Iyer.  Early life  Thumboo Chetty was born in April 1837, to a Catholic family, apparently in Trichinopoly. His father, Desayi Royalu Chetti Garu filled the responsible post of Chief Book-keeper in a Mercantile Firm, Griffith's and Co., and was highly respected in the native Christian community in Madras. His mother was Catherine Ummah, a woman of piety, mildness, courtesy and serenity. He spent his early life in the Black Town, later called George Town, Madras. After his primary education in Madras, where he was taught in the Southern vernaculars Telugu and Tamil, he received his education in English in the famous Free Church Mission Institution, which was later renamed Madras Christian College. He was the sixth child in his family; he had three elder sisters and one younger brother and a sister, all of whom lived long enough to see his progress and advancement. It is said that his mother prophesied at his birth, \\"The sixth, being male, will rise to be a great man and rule over people\\". He had, however, the misfortune to lose both his parents at the early age of twelve. He was brought up, however, with great care and attention, by no less than five executors, to whom the probate of his mother's will was granted by the Madras High Court, the principal of whom, afterwards, became his father-in-law. Thumboo Chetty married Rajamma, daughter of Ponnoo Chettiar and Sinnammalle, Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Refuge, Pophan’s Broadway, Madras. The couple had four sons: T. Rayaloo Chetty, T. Dharma Raj Chetty, T. Sathya Raj Chetty, and T. Thumboo Chetty; and four daughters: Amarapatty Amma, Sathiavathy Amma, Dhanavathy Amma, and Baghavathy Amma.  Civil service and law practice  After leaving school, Thumboo Chetty first apprenticed himself at Mercantile Firm, Griffith's and Co., where his father, Desai Royaloo Chettiar, well versed in accounts, worked as a Chief Bookkeeper. In December 1855, he entered the Public Service as a clerk, then as treasurer, and finally as indexer, in the Office of the Quarter Master General of the Madras Army. In 1862, Thumboo Chetty became the manager of the first Madras Legislative Council, of which John Dawson Mayne, an eminent barrister, was the Legislative Secretary. While John Mayne was Professor of Law in the Madras Presidency College, Thumboo Chetty was induced to study law. He then joined law classes, and in the final examination held in 1866, he won the first prize for proficiency in law. Before he joined the Mysore Civil Service, Thumboo Chetty was the a judge in the Court of District Munsiff of Purghi, Bellary, appointed in 1866 by the High Court of Madras. He was soon afterwards appointed sheristadar of the Judicial Commissioner's Court at Bangalore in 1867. In the year 1879, Thumboo Chetty was appointed District and Sessions Judge of Nandidroog Division, the first Indian to be appointed to this post. He discharged this duty with commendable ability for about five years.  Public office in Mysore Kingdom  After the Rendition of Mysore which took place in 1881, T. R. A. Thumboo Chetty was nominated ex-officio Senior Member of the Maharaja's Council Chamarajendra Wodayar. In 1884, when the Chief Court of Mysore was constituted, this court being the highest court of appeal in the Mysore Kingdom, T. R. A. Thumboo Chetty was appointed one of its three judges, and subsequently the Chief Judge in July 1890. He, thus became the first Indian Chief Judge of the Chief Court of Mysore. He was invested as a Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire in 1895. Sir K. Seshadri Iyer was the diwan of Maharaja Chamaraja Wadiyar. During his ministry, Thumboo Chetty officiated for him on three occasions, in 1890, later in 1892, and 1893. In 1894. The sudden demise of the Maharaja Chamarajendra Wodayar and his eldest son Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV was a minor at that time led Mr. T. R. A. Thumboo Chetty's nomination in 1895 as the Senior Member of the Regency Council of Mysore of Maharani Kempa Nanjammani Vani Vilasa Sannidhana. He was relieved as the Chief Judge on 4 November 1895 and continued to serve as a full-time councillor. Seshadri Iyer continued to be the Dewan of Mysore during the period of the Regency, during when, Thumboo Chetty officiated twice again, once in 1897, and in 1900. Seshadri Iyer, who had served the state since 1 January 1883, resigned the office of Dewan and President of the State Council, owing to ill-health, on 18 March 1901. On the same date, Thumboo Chetty, Member of the Regency Council, was granted leave preparatory to retirement. Thus happily ended the official career of one who, from humble situations, from a clerk he gradually rose to be the First Indian Chief Judge of the Chief Court of Mysore and the Dewan of one of the principal Native States in British India.

Background When the Axis launched Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, Romania joined the invasion with the aims of recovering the provinces of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, which were lost to the Soviet Union the previous year. On 26 June, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet unsuccessfully attacked the Romanian port of Constanța, resulting in the loss of the destroyer leader Moskva to Romanian mines.Robert Forczyk, Where the Iron Crosses Grow: The Crimea 1941–44, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2014, p. 39David T.

Năluca was the first to arrive at the scene and subsequently spotted and engaged the Soviet Shchuka-class submarine Shch-206 (Captain S. A. Karakai). In the first part of the battle, Năluca attacked the submarine with 20 mm rounds, but the latter submerged in order to escape. The Romanian torpedo boat subsequently used depth charges, being soon joined by the two motor torpedo boats.

He collected numerous marine animals as well as plants and fossils–many of which were new to science–and published scientific papers on whales, fossils, and medicine. He received the Polar Medal along with other Terra Nova members in 1913. He was also a noted caricaturist who made cartoons of professors, colleagues, and friends: some of his caricatures are collected in the National Portrait Gallery. He worked as a government bacteriologist during World War I and then suffered a severe mental breakdown, spending three years at Bethlem Royal Hospital and never fully recovering. He is commemorated in the names of several marine organisms as well as Lillie Glacier in Antarctica.  Early life and education  Lillie was born 27 August 1884 in Kensington to a family from New Zealand. His grandfather John Lillie (1806–1866) was a noted Presbyterian minister in Tasmania who relocated to Christchurch. Lillie attended United Services College in Devon and was educated at the University of Birmingham before entering St John's College, Cambridge, in 1906. where earned his B.A. in 1909. Biologist G. E. Fogg describes his performance in Cambridge's Natural Sciences Tripos as \\"not too good\\", earning second class in Part I, third class in Part II, and his M.A. later in 1914. Between 1907 and 1908 he studied fossil plants of the Bristol Coalfield collected by Herbert Bolton, describing a new species of Sphenopteris. He spent the summer of 1909 studying whales at a whaling station in Ireland's Inishkea Islands. At Cambridge, Lillie gained a reputation for caricatures of faculty members, including the geneticist William Bateson and the botanists Frederick Blackman and Arthur George Tansley. These drawings caught the attention of Arthur Shipley, who collected some of them which were eventually deposited into the National Portrait Gallery in London.  Terra Nova Expedition  Around 1909, Lillie was recruited by Edward A. Wilson, chief scientist for the upcoming British Antarctic Expedition (1910–1913) led by Captain Robert Falcon Scott. Lillie joined E. W. Nelson, the Expedition's other biologist, at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Plymouth to prepare. Lillie and the rest of the crew of the Terra Nova sailed from Cardiff, Wales, on 15 June 1910. The destination was Antarctica, where Scott hoped to be the first to reach the South Pole. Described as a \\"frail-looking 26-year-old whom Scott had doubted at the beginning,\\" Lillie soon came down with measles. On 25 July, the Terra Nova stopped at the island of South Trinidad (now known as Trindade) off the coast of Brazil, and having recovered from the measles, Lillie went ashore to collect plants, of which 13 species turned out to be previously unknown from the island. G. Murray Levick sorting samples aboard the Terra Nova Lillie was the biologist in charge of operations on board the Terra Nova, and collected marine samples by trawling, dredging, and tow-netting. Specimens were collected in waters off the coast of Brazil, the Falkland Islands, the Three Kings Islands, as well as the Ross Sea and McMurdo Sound. With the help of others he collected deep sea organisms including sponges, worms, and fish. Captain Scott and assistant zoologist Apsley Cherry-Garrard both recalled Lillie was especially excited to find specimens of Cephalodiscus, a hemichordate that was rare at the time and whose ancestor was thought to be a link between vertebrates and invertebrates. Wilson wrote: \\"trawling probably caused more excitement and interest in the ship than anything else... and the instant a catch came in-board Lillie was surrounded by an interested group of men, very anxious to see if any startling novelty had at last been dragged up from the bottom.\\" Lillie gave popular lectures on evolution to the crew, which helped break the monotony. He was also known for his caricatures of the crew, some of which were printed in the South Polar Times, the expedition's magazine. \\"A Quiet Sunday Evening on the Terra Nova\\", 1910 Lillie never went ashore in Antarctica, but explored other southern islands. He also paid special attention to whales and dolphins, recording all those seen from the ship. In October 1911 he visited the Whaling Station at Whangamumu, near the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, and in 1912 spent July to October in the same region on two floating factories belonging to the New Zealand Whaling Company. In June 1911 he gave a lecture on whale natural history at the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury and published his observations after the expedition, describing a new species of dolphin: Lagenorhynchus wilsoni (now regarded as a taxonomic synonym of L. cruciger, the hourglass dolphin). Lillie was described by Cherry-Garrard's biographer Sara Wheeler as popular yet perhaps the most unconventional person on the expedition, deeply intellectual yet eccentric. He believed in reincarnation, and claimed he had been a Persian and a Roman in previous lives. His nicknames on board included \\"Lithley, \\"Lithi\\", and \\"Hercules\\". Captain Scott, Wilson, and three other expedition members died in Antarctica in March 1912, after reaching South Pole. The Terra Nova, with Lillie aboard, departed from Lyttelton, New Zealand, for its return voyage on 13 May 1913, making more stops along the way to collect samples. The Terra Nova returned to Cardiff on 14 June 1913, almost exactly three years to the day after it had departed. Lillie and the other expedition members were awarded the Polar Medal in July 1913.  Later years  Lillie received his M.A. from Cambridge in 1914. During the First World War he was a conscientious objector and worked as a military bacteriologist, a job he described as \\"examining military shit for three pounds a week\\". He published reports on the treatment of Entamoeba histolytica and dysentery. He remained close friends with fellow Terra Nova member Cherry-Garrard. In 1917 he had plans to go to East Africa. In February 1918, suffering from severe depression, delusion, and suicidal thoughts, Lillie was admitted to Bethlem Royal Hospital, the psychiatric hospital popularly known as \\"Bedlam\\". He had shown no signs of mental illness previously. Cherry-Garrard requested to visit multiple times, but was told by staff that Lillie was not well enough to have visitors, and was frequently relapsing. Bethlem's normal twelve-month limit on residency was waived in consideration of donations to the hospital from the Captain Scott Memorial Fund. Lillie spent three years at Bethlem, being released in January 1921, and began lecturing at Cambridge before a relapse sent him to Buckinghamshire Mental Hospital in October. He was transferred back to Bethlem a month later, then to Old Manor Hospital, Salisbury, in 1924. He never recovered from his mental breakdown. He died in Redhills Hospital, Exeter, on 13 May 1963, aged 78. G. E. Fogg notes there were no obituaries in The Times or local newspapers. Lillie is commemorated in the scientific names of several organisms collected during the Terra Nova Expedition, including the fish Notopogon lilliei, the serpulid worm Apomatus lilliei, and the sea anemone genus Lilliella. In 1913, palaeobotanist E. A. Newell Arber published on fossils Lillie had collected in New Zealand in 1911, and named the fossil plant Linguifolium lillieanum in his honour. The poet A. Y. Campbell mentions Lillie in his 1915 poem \\"Solus Hyperboreas\\", subtitled \\"Ode to a pocket edition of Virgil in the possession of D G Lillie, biologist to the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910\\". He is also the namesake of Lillie Glacier, a glacier in Antarctica named by members of the Terra Nova expedition. Works    Notes References  External links  * Caricatures by D. G.

He got his early education from his hometown Hyderabad but went to receive his higher education from (Calcatta) now Kolkata, Bengal. Where he met great people like Shri Keshab Chandra Sen and Swami Ramakrishna Paramhansa, which inspired him so much that when he returned home, he established an academy called Union Academy in Hyderabad along with his brother Sadhu Navalrai, the purpose of this academy was to raise awareness amongst young people and educate them about things happening in the world.Datta, Amaresh (1988). Encyclopedia of Indian Lirerature. New Delhi: South Asia Books. pp. 86–87. Soon, they both launched awareness campaigns throughout the city to promote education; particularly for girls, it was quite uncommon for girls to go to school back then. As most of the parents were reluctant because they feared that their girls will become transgress. He also started a sindhi newspaper Sind Sudhar in 1886, where he remained as the chief editor for three years. He died at very young age but contributed too much during his short life.

He carried out the first heart transplant in Ukraine. He is an advocate of economics-based healthcare management and civilized transplantology.  Biography  Borys Todurov was born in Kyiv on 2 January 1965. His father was Mikhail Ivanovich Todurov, who was an assistant locomotive driver. His mother was Nina Ivanovna Todurova, a rural doctor. Both were from Yalta village. his brother is Ivan Todurov. His wife is Olena Todurova. His children are Mikhail and Natalia. From 2000-2003, he was the Head of the Department of Transplantation and Heart Surgery with a group of extra corporeal technologies and biomaterials, Shalimov National Institute of Surgery and Transplantology, Kyiv From 2003-2006, he was the Deputy Director for Transplantology, Shalimov National Institute of Surgery and Transplantology, Kyiv From 2006-2008, he was Initiator and co-author of a project on construction of the most modern medical facility in Kyiv - the Kyiv City Heart Center. From 2008-2013, he was the Head of City Clinical Hospital \\"The Kyiv Heart Center\\" From 2013 to the present, he is the Director of The Heart Institute of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine (formerly The Kyiv Heart Center), Kyiv From September 2016 to the present, he is the Head of the Department of Cardiac Surgery, Roentgen-Endovascular and Extracorporeal Technologies of Shupyk National Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education. In December 2016, he was recognized as the \\"Person of the Year\\" according to “Novoye Vremya Magazine\\" \\"For saving lives and innovating in medicine\\". In January 2017, he came under an information attack from a team carrying out efforts on behalf of acting Minister Ulyana Suprun. He received an invitation from two clinics from the European Union and one from Georgia to relocate the entire clinical team, but refused to leave Ukraine.  Activity as a doctor  Borys Todurov has 30 years of experience as a cardiac surgeon. During this time, he carried out more than 5 thousand surgeries. In 2000, he performed a heart transplant; for the first time in Ukraine. In 2001, for the first time in Ukraine, he conducted the Batista procedure (an alternative to heart transplantation). The same year, for the first time in Ukraine, he carried out a thoracoscopic surgery for a child with congenital heart disease. In 2002, for the first time in Ukraine, he made a thrombectomy from the inferior vena cava in a complex with nephrectomy under the conditions of artificial circulation. From 2000 to 2007, he performed four heart transplants, three of which were successful. On 12 July 2016, Borys Todurov for the first time in Ukraine, he conducted the implantation of an artificial heart. This device cost EUR 120K. The German clinic made the courtesy of installment plan to The Heart Institute, owing to Todurov's reputation amongst international cardiac surgeons. Part of the funds was collected at a charity race and through a crowdfunding platform. There were no state funds spent to implement this innovation. Nevertheless, President Poroshenko in his New Year's greetings speech noted the artificial heart transplantation as one of the top country's achievements in 2016.  Prevention  Boris Todurov is an active blogger on the topic of cardiovascular prevention. Since 2016, he manages his own YouTube channel, as well as a column at the tabloid Ukrainska Pravda. He promotes a healthy lifestyle and heart check-up at least as often as Ukrainians make checkups for their cars.  International peacekeeping missions  In 1999, B. Todurov organized the humanitarian mission to Egypt and made surgeries in Cairo for 16 children with congenital heart disease. In 2002, Todurov visited Iraq, where he worked on creating a joint Ukrainian-Iraqi project to save children. As a part of this mission, he made two surgeries in Baghdad for children with congenital heart disease. In 2005, Todurov organized a humanitarian mission to Kosovo. There he performed three operations for children with congenital heart disease. 2006 - humanitarian mission to Azerbaijan. He operated congenital heart disease of five children from low- income refugee families from the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict region. In March 2014 he organized a humanitarian mission to Crimea, a week before it was occupied by Russian military troops. Todurov and his team of surgeons and anaesthesiologists attempted to enforce medical facilities of Feodosia military base, which was besieged by Russians at that time. Doctors brought medications and ambulance dressings in case of military combat. At the exit from the Crimea peninsula, Todurov was asked to operate an elderly woman with acute myocardial infarction. Later it turned out that the patient was the mother of Sergei Aksyonov, the self-proclaimed minister of the Crimea.  The Heart Institute  The Heart Institute of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine provides highly specialized assistance to patients with cardiovascular pathology and surgical care for patients with heart defects. It was created in 2008 as the city clinical hospital \\"The Kyiv Heart Center\\" following the instance of the German clinic Herzzentrum, the German Cardiology Center in Munich. On 26 December 2013 Todurov influenced to change the communal ownership to the national one, with Ministry of Health as executor of the estate. This change helped to save The Heart Center from intentional bankruptcy and privatization from the side of state officials. Every year The Heart Institute provides medical care to patients from all regions of Ukraine. In 2016 Institute performed the most cardiac surgeries in the country - 5940, being ahead of the Amosov Heart Institute and Strazhesko Institute of Cardiology. Each third CABG operation in Ukraine takes place at The Heart Institute (1,436 operations, for comparison at the Amosov Institute - 844 operations). Each third stent in Ukraine is installed in The Heart Institute (2593 interventions; for comparison at Amosov Institute - 449). At The Heart Institute, Todurov organized internal eHealth system and quality management system. As a result, the percentage of unsuccessful operations is lower than in the average clinic in Europe and does not reach 1%. This result made it possible for the Institute to become in 2015 the first hospital in the CIS which met the requirements of international medical accreditation from the British company QHA Trent. The availability of this certificate gives to foreign insurance companies the basis to pay for the treatment of foreign citizens at The Heart Institute. In 2016 patients came from Azerbaijan, Greece, Israel, United States, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, Libya and other countries. The Institute is a permanent partner of the diplomatic corps stationed in Ukraine. It helped many foreign delegates and members of their families. In December 2016, the mother of the US Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch was operated at The Heart Institute. At the entrance to The Heart Institute, along with the flag of Ukraine and the corporate flag, there is the flag of the Crimean Mejlis. Mustafa Dzhemilev knelt before this flag during his visit to the Institute. The Heart Institute has been the object of encroachment by political figures repeatedly.  Support in the Anti- terroristic operation (ATO) zone  Borys Todurov has visited the combat operational zone more than 10 times since the beginning of the war in the Donbass region of Ukraine. There he conducts surgeries on the spot and makes charitable donations of medicines and military uniforms to Ukrainian soldiers. In the summer of 2014, he visited Slovyansk, Donetsk region. Doctors brought medicines and took three wounded warriors for treatment at The Heart Institute. In addition, Borys Todurov makes surgery for civilians from the ATO zone. He conducts advisory receptions in Kramatorsk, Bakhmut, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk. In Donetsk and Lugansk regions, all highly specialized medical institutions of the cardiological profile remained on territories under occupation (ORDLO), and people left without healthcare. To solve the problem Todurov for his own money organized preparations for launching the branches of The Heart Institute in both regions. As an argument, it was stated that it was possible to follow the example of Cleveland Clinic (USA) and to spread the expertise of a well-established center in other regions. However, the Acting Minister Suprun and her team did not allow the activity of the branches, referring to the discrepancy with the plans for the decentralization reform.  Civil position  Borys Todurov believes that Ukrainian cardiac surgeons are indebted to their patients. At the national need of 140 thousand cardiac surgeries per year, the Ukrainian facilities perform slightly more than 15%. At the need of 200 thousand angiographic procedures and stentings, it is performed about 15%. Repeatedly Borys Todurov has spoken out against the imperfection of the existing system of managing healthcare. In 2011, he entered into a public debate with Health Minister Ilya Yemets (21 December 2010 – 17 May 2011) in the context of healthcare reform. As a response, Yemets tried to lower the rank of The Heart Institute from high-level cardiac care facility to an ordinary hospital for the treatment of patients with myocardial infarction or stroke. The cardiac surgeon made public statements that the \\"people\\" of Kyiv's mayor Chernovetsky asked for a bribe - 30% of the clinic's revenue. Todurov one of the few was able to repulse the people from the criminal family of Yanukovych and Bohatyryova, who tried to get as a bribe the 30% share of the national cardiovascular program. Also, Borys Todurov publicly commented on the inactivity of Minister Sandro Kvitashvili on the issue of health care reform. Todurov is the active advocate for urgent human organ transplantation reform. He publicly criticized the head of the Parliament Health Committee Dr. Olga Bogomolets and Committee deputy Oksana Korchynska. According to him, \\"Ukrainian legislation prevents organ transplanting and, thereby, saving lives of many people.\\" Before voting in the Verkhovna Rada, Todurov recorded a video message to the parliament members on supporting the Law on Transplantation. In a video he stated that his organs are settled for transplantation upon his death. On 13 November 2016, on the TV show “The Cabinets” on Channel 5 Todurov made a negative response on results of Health Minister Suprun's team. On 1 January 2017 Todurov published a video message criticizing the activities of Ministry of Health. The video collected about 500,000 views on the Facebook and YouTube, and was the reason for the large- scale campaign against the cardiac surgeon from the pharmaceutical lobbyists and supporters of the acting Minister Suprun. In his video, Todurov criticized the failure of procurement of cardiovascular medical supplies with the budget of 2016 up till the year ended (364 million UAH). According to his calculations, they could save tens of thousands of lives. The team of the Ministry of Health, headed by the acting Minister of Health Ulyana Suprun did not accomplish the procurement. As a result, in early 2017 Ukrainian patients didn't have the necessary drugs and supplies. One of Todurov's reasons was that the procurement of medical supplies through international intermediaries became the outdated practice. During three years upon Maidan, it was developed the Prozorro electronic procurement system. It gives the public much more transparency, does not have many months of delays, and does not cost any service commission. Independent analytical group FactCheckUA checked Todurov's words and found that in 2015 the time between the announcement of procurement tender by international intermediaries and the delivery of drugs was 11 months. The first procurement tender on 2016 budget was announced only on 28 December 2016. FactCheck stressed that it wasn't buying drugs, as claimed by the MOH. The analytical group also mentioned the service commission of international intermediary Crown Agents, which was engaged in the purchase of medicines. The commission amounted to 1.8 million EUR (according to the company). At the same time, if purchases were made by the Prozorro system (there is no commission with this system), then 12 874 stenting operations could be spent on the saved money, which would save 4% of patients with acute myocardial infarction. Todurov also criticized representatives of the Ministry of Health for blocking the creation of branches of the Heart Institute in Mariupol and Severodonetsk, where patients actually do not have access to cardiovascular treatment. Todurov was publicly supported by well-known medical figures: deputy director of the Institute of Neurosurgery Andrei Guk and director of the Endocrine Surgery Center Oleksandr Larin, as well as public people such as: Parliament Member Konstantin Yarynych, Kyiv businessman, writer and blogger Garik Korogodski, Massi Nayem, Alexandr Noinets and Oleg Musiy, Dmitry Rosenfeld. In response to the video message of Todurov, the team of U. Suprun applied administrative pressure, announcing the re-accreditation of The Heart Institute. On 5 January the team of Ulyana Suprun announced a crowdsourcing competition to identify non-transparent purchases in Prozorro system. The only public participant in this flashmob was Evgenia Zakrevska, a lawyer. On 6 January, Evgenia Zakrevska published an accusation of The Heart Institute in inflating the prices for purchasing the drug \\"Cefopectam\\". On 6 January, Todurov denied these accusations, referring to the MOH order (No. 546) of 26 August 2015, which sets for state healthcare facilities the retail prices for this drug. They were not exceeded when purchased. The analysis of Zakrevskaya's page showed that her account was working for four days around the clock, which indicates that the lawyer's account was conducted not by one person. During this timeframe, the posts about Borys Todurov were actively published and commented on her Facebook page. Also, it was organized a massive cyber attack against Todurov. On 9 January 2017, Borys Todurov's official page in Facebook was blocked, then it was blocked a personal account too. On 27 January a fake page was created, called \\"Borys Todurov gives one of his apartments\\", where were reported untrue data about his “possession of several apartments”. On this page, the author ostensibly wrote that Todurov would give one of his apartments just for \\"repost and subscribe to this page.\\" The page was intensively promoted in Facebook, having achieved tens of thousands of impressions. Also on the Facebook page called \\"Victor Medvedchuk\\" was published the post with words of support addressed to Boris Todurov. The investigation of journalist Alexander Noinets showed a direct link between PR-manager of Ulyana Suprun Bryan Mefford and Viktor Medvedchuk.

Greene, A Woman of the Century Isabel Colton Greene, known as Belle C. Green (March 17, 1842March 10, 1926), was an American author of humorous novels. Early life Isabel (nickname, \\"Belle\\") Colton was born in Pittsfield, Vermont, on March 17, 1842. Her ancestors were a mix of American, English and Native American. One of her ancestors on her father's side married a Native American princess belonging to a Massachusetts tribe, and settled in that State. Her mother, Lucy Baker, came from Puritan stock; she died at the age of 47, leaving her husband and a family of six girls. Isabel, who was next to the youngest, was four years old at the time. She was taken into the family of a distant relative living in Nashua, New Hampshire, where she was reared and educated in strictest orthodox ways. Career It was not till the year 1881 that Belle Greene began her literary work in earnest. She sent a short story and a humorous sketch to her friend, Mrs. Phelps-Ward, then Miss Phelps, asking for advice and encouragement. Phelps replied with characteristic honesty and kindness that Greene's voice was doubtless her one great gift, and, as mortals were seldom blessed with two, she advised her to stick to music, but added, since she must give an opinion, that she considered the humorous sketch better than the story. Upon this scanty encouragement Greene offered the humorous sketch to Godey's Lady's Book, and it was accepted. She continued to furnish sketches for a year or more, and concluded her work for the magazine by writing her first story proper, a novelette, afterward published in book form under the title A New England Idyl (1886). She wrote also for Youths Companion and Harpers Weekly. Adventures of an Old Maid (1886), a second book, was a collection of humorous sketches published first in the magazines, and sold over 75,000 copies. Her religious novel, A New England Conscience (1885), attracted wide comment. Though severely denounced by some of the critics, it was regarded by others as a masterpiece of condensed thought and realistic character drawing. Other works include: Mr. and Mrs. Hannibal Hawkins (1897), The hobbledehoy; the story of one betwixt boy and man (1895), Hobbly Dr. Hoe (the story of a man who attempted to understand the mind of a boy). In 1887–88, Greene made an extended tour of southern California and the Pacific Coast, and during her stay of several months in Los Angeles and San Diego she contributed to the newspapers a series of humorous sketches founded upon the phases of the boom, which added greatly to her reputation as a humorous writer. These last-mentioned articles constitute her only newspaper work, with the exception of the Mill Papers, regarding the operatives in the cotton-mills, written for the Boston Transcript in 1883 and 1884. Personal life In 1868, Colton married Martin Van Buren Greene, of Nashua, New Hampshire. They had one son, Edward Martin Greene, who became Professor of Romance Languages at the University of South Dakota. Edward was her constant companion on several trips across the continent to California, as well to Europe. She used to spend summers with her sister in Palatine, Illinois, since 1910. She died there on March 10, 1926, and is buried at Hillside Cemetery. Her grandson, John Colton Greene, a former president of the History of Science Society and winner of its 2002 George Sarton Medal for outstanding scholarly achievement, was a Professor of History at the University of Connecticut.

Examples of Third-party software for cars include allowing data input while moving, traffic jam assistance, diagnostics and lane-keeping. These pieces of software can be standalone or linked to the cars computers via the \\"ODB\\" port that is present in almost all cars made since the mid-1990s.  Overview  Schematic of an OBD port. Android, Windows, and iPhone Operating System (IOS) all offer software to connect a smartphone with a car. Car Play and Android Auto apps transmit the home screen of any Android or IOS smartphone to the car built-in display. Therefore, apps installed on the connected smartphone will become available on car screen. Sometimes car apps require additional hardware which plugs into the on-board diagnostics (OBD) port to record, collect and provide the data about engine errors. Some apps, along with additional hardware, give keyless access to the car and let the owner start the engine using a smartphone. Drivers can install a dash cam app and use a smartphone to capture the driving process. Information about the owner's driving habits can be recorded by car software with the help of OBD port. If the vehicle's speedometer is not functioning properly, car apps can provide accurate car speed. Car software collects live data about road signs, speed limits and traffic cameras ahead. Some car apps send real-time notifications about road accidentsIntegrated Traffic Information Service System for Public Travel Based on Smart Phones Applications: A Case in China and traffic jams en route.  Types of car apps  =OBD apps= On-board Diagnostic apps require an additional piece of hardware called an OBD adapter to be plugged into the OBD port.() The OBD app is installed on an appropriate smartphone or tablet, connecting to the OBD adapter through Wifi or Bluetooth signals. Car owners can monitor their vehicle in real time, and receive information about engine temperature, and car performance. OBD codes indicate the location and nature of problems. Often OBD apps offer additional features such as journey recording, CO2 emission calculation, horsepower evaluation, dynamo meter, fuel consumption, and driving time. An alarm feature is usually present as well – such apps alert the driver about speeding, low voltage, and high temperature. Some apps perform an analysis of driving behavior, recording car owner's habits, calculating money spent on every mile, and giving tips on improving the riding process.() =Navigation apps= right Navigation software can provide data on altitude, moon phase, traffic cameras, and traffic jams. Users can look for addresses using geo-tagged images, and some apps provide a worldwide maps feature where one app contains maps of various cities around the world. Some software can calculate speed, distance covered and provide estimated time to the destination point. =Dash cam apps= Dash cam apps record everything that happens on the road and can provide essential evidence when investigating road accidents. Most dash cam apps have YouTube integration and upload the recordings to the driver's YouTube account. Some software can turn on automatically when detecting shakes or sudden changes on the road, and record video. The video is recorded in high resolution, and when the device's memory is full, old videos are usually deleted automatically to save space. =Voice control apps= Apps which support voice commands help users drive safely. These apps make calls, dictate messages, announce the current time, and read weather forecast. Some of the apps also offer Android Auto connectivity Google Maps integration. All of these functions can be controlled with voice commands.() =Radio substitution apps= Some apps provide an alternative to standard car radio. Apps such as Android Auto, Spotify, and Tune In Radio allow the driver to stream music. = Car history apps = Car history apps maintain a car's maintenance log. It can help in proper maintenance of it and also in increasing its resale value. Without a vehicle history, it's not possible to know the damages or product recalls it may have suffered during the past. =Car dealer apps= right Apps for car dealers have various features to showcase vehicle inventory. Some of these apps let dealerships show vehicle history reports by reading the Vehicle Identification Number, which can provide detail on all recorded owners, road accidents, repair works, and visits to mechanics. Using this software, dealerships can give their customers detailed report of the car state – damages, year made, provide images, add vehicle options.Vehicle Inspection Report Some apps offer catalogs of vehicles, GPS indication of inventory location, business management on the go, reports, email integration, SMS integration, add and edit stock info. Some apps are able to collect actual car prices around the world and select the best offers; based on vehicle inspection the software can compare the price and condition of the car. This allows users to compare retail listing prices from the most famous sites. =Alerting apps= Some of the alerting apps use crowd sourcing – this helps collect up-to-date information about road accidents, traffic jams, and police traps along the route. Some software can automatically send data about the user's location to your friends and family, as an opt-in feature. Apps can also work as a collision-prevention system – they can detect when the car in front suddenly starts to stop using smartphone cameras. Real traffic information is a usual feature of modern vehicle software – a user can shake his smartphone to notify others about jammed street; the app can also offer you an alternative way to your destination to avoid heavy traffic. =Car-sharing apps= A car can be shared using notifications in the system, a user sets the time the car is available and other people will use it (Link & Co). Uber is a car-sharing app which helps users quickly pick up a car that is nearby and go to the point at cheap rates instead of taking a taxi; or one can offer his car and himself as a driver.

The offensive was an attempt by Andrey Yeryomenko's Bryansk Front to destroy Heinz Guderian's 2nd Panzer Group after it turned south towards Kiev. The offensive failed as a result of armor dispersion and poor intelligence, and the 2nd Panzer Group inflicted heavy casualties on the front's forces, significantly weakening it in advance of Operation Typhoon, which began three weeks later. The German troops continued their advance southwards, resulting in the Kiev encirclement battle.  Prelude  = 29 August = On 28 August, the 2nd Panzer Group continued to advance southward, crossing the Desna River near Novgorod-Seversky and Korop by the end of the day. The Stavka ordered the Bryansk Front and Southwestern Front Air Forces to concentrate their aircraft on blocking the group's advance, but the aviation failed to halt the German troops. By the end of 29 August, XXIV Motorized Corps' 10th Motorized Division's lead Kampfgruppe had advanced 20 kilometers to the south, reaching positions to the north of the Seym River, 20 kilometers north of Bakhmach, and engaging elements of the 40th Army's 293rd Rifle Division in the Korop area and the 21st Army's 67th Rifle Corps along the Seym. At the same time, the 3rd Panzer Division reached Glukhov's western approaches, 50 kilometers southeast of the Desna at Novgorod-Seversky, where it ran into 40th Army's main body, including the 10th Tank Division and the 5th Antitank Brigade. Behind the 10th Motorized and 3rd Panzer, the 4th Panzer Division of the XXIV Corps and the 17th Panzer and 29th Motorized Division of XXXXVII Motorized Corps were echeloned to the rear at Novgorod-Seversky and west of Trubchevsk. The 4th Panzer was fighting 13th Army's 52nd Cavalry Division in the Novgorod-Seversky area and the army's main forces west of Trubchevsk. Farther to the rear, the 18th Panzer Division of the XXXXVII Corps was quickly moving southward from Roslavl while mopping up stragglers from the 13th Army in 2nd Panzer Group's rear west of the Desna. To the west of the 2nd Panzer Group, infantry divisions of Maximilian von Weichs's 2nd Army pushed the remnants of Vasily Kuznetsov's 21st Army and the old 3rd Army towards Chernigov, while eliminating the 21st Army remnants surrounded in a large salient pocket northeast of Chernigov and north of the Desna. The 21st Army and old 3rd Army were part of the Bryansk Front.  Opposing forces  XXIV Motorized Corps, commanded by Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg, had a daily operational strength of roughly 320 tanks (including 128 Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks, with the rest being Panzer I, Panzer II, and command tanks) which was well below half of its strength at the beginning of Operation Barbarossa. Kuzma Podlas' 40th Army, which became part of the Southwestern Front on 26 August, was responsible for defending the front's right flank and maintaining contact with the Bryansk Front on its right. It included the 135th Rifle Division, the 293rd Rifle Division, 10th Tank Division, 2nd Airborne Corps, and the 5th Anti-Tank Brigade.

In 1554 he had negotiated an agreement with the local authorities of Guangzhou known as the first Luso- Chinese agreement which allowed the legalization of Portuguese commercial activities in China through the payment of taxes. This agreement opened the way for the establishment of Macau as Portuguese warehouse three years later. This agreement which was negotiated by Leonel de Sousa, captain-chief of Japan's voyage, opened a new era in Sino-Portuguese relations, because since 1522 the Portuguese were officially prevented from trading: several embassies had failed and trade was carried out as contraband and fought by the authorities, who considered them 'folanji' fighting them as pirates. Agreement negotiation Since the arrival in Japan in 1543, the Portuguese had begun an intense commerce between Goa and Malacca with Japan. Leonel de Sousa, the chief captain of Japan's voyage, arrived at the coast of Guangdong in 1552, where he learned that all foreigners were permitted to trade there for the fee payment, except the 'Folanji' (the pejorative name for the Europeans and for the Portuguese in particular, which were considered as pirates).The Cambridge history of China, p.344 He promised that the peace conditions and the taxes payment to be fulfilled providing the authorities to change this 'name'. In 1554 Leonel de Sousa, together with the chief captain of Chaul, made an agreement with officials of Canton to legalize the Portuguese commerce, on conditions that they would pay the stipulated customs duties.DIFFIE, SHAFER, WINIUS, Bailey Wallys, Boyd C., George Davison, \\"Foundations of the Portuguese empire, 1415-1580\\", p.389 The only written testimony of this agreement is a letter from Leonel de Sousa of 1556 to the Infant D.

The letter is one of the most important documents in the history of Sino-Portuguese relations, describes the prolonged negotiations with the superintendent of the navy of Canton, the Haitao Wang Po, identified in the Chinese sources as that who had accepted a bribe of the Portuguese by letting them pay taxes in Canton. As the port of Guangzhou also faced impoverishment since it was closed to foreign trade the agreement was profitable for both sides. Leonel de Sousa tried to negotiate the payment of only 10% of the fees, to which Wan Po counterposed the obligatory 20% but focusing only on half the load, which Leonel de Sousa took with the help of the wealthy merchant Simão d'Almeida, and outside the Beijing government.

Before the modern era, education would begin at a young age with study of Arabic and the Quran. Some students would then proceed to training in tafsir (Quranic exegesis) and fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), which was seen as particularly important. For the first few centuries of Islam, educational settings were entirely informal, but beginning in the 11th and 12th centuries, the ruling elites began to establish institutions of higher religious learning known as madrasas in an effort to secure support and cooperation of the ulema (religious scholars). Madrasas soon multiplied throughout the Islamic world, which helped to spread Islamic learning beyond urban centers and to unite diverse Islamic communities in a shared cultural project. Madrasas were devoted principally to study of Islamic law, but they also offered other subjects such as theology, medicine, and mathematics. Muslims historically distinguished disciplines inherited from pre-Islamic civilizations, such as philosophy and medicine, which they called \\"sciences of the ancients\\" or \\"rational sciences\\", from Islamic religious sciences. Sciences of the former type flourished for several centuries, and their transmission formed part of the educational framework in classical and medieval Islam. In some cases, they were supported by institutions such as the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, but more often they were transmitted informally from teacher to student. While formal studies in madrasas were open only to men, women of prominent urban families were commonly educated in private settings and many of them received and later issued ijazas (diplomas) in hadith studies, calligraphy and poetry recitation. Working women learned religious texts and practical skills primarily from each other, though they also received some instruction together with men in mosques and private homes. Etymology In Arabic three terms are used for education. The most common is ta'līm, from the root 'alima, which means knowing, being aware, perceiving and learning. Another term is Tarbiyah from the root of raba, which means spiritual and moral growth based on the will of God. The third term is Ta'dīb from the root aduba which means to be cultured or refined in social behavior. Education in pre-modern Islam The centrality of scripture and its study in the Islamic tradition helped to make education a central pillar of the religion in virtually all times and places in the history of Islam. The importance of learning in the Islamic tradition is reflected in a number of hadiths attributed to Muhammad, including one that instructs the faithful to \\"seek knowledge, even in China\\". This injunction was seen to apply particularly to scholars, but also to some extent to the wider Muslim public, as exemplified by the dictum of Al-Zarnuji, \\"learning is prescribed for us all\\". While it is impossible to calculate literacy rates in pre-modern Islamic societies, it is almost certain that they were relatively high, at least in comparison to their European counterparts. Organized instruction in the Cairo Al-Azhar Mosque began in 978 Education would begin at a young age with study of Arabic and the Quran, either at home or in a primary school, which was often attached to a mosque. Some students would then proceed to training in tafsir (Quranic exegesis) and fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), which was seen as particularly important. Education focused on memorization, but also trained the more advanced students to participate as readers and writers in the tradition of commentary on the studied texts. It also involved a process of socialization of aspiring scholars, who came from virtually all social backgrounds, into the ranks of the ulema. For the first few centuries of Islam, educational settings were entirely informal, but beginning in the 11th and 12th centuries, the ruling elites began to establish institutions of higher religious learning known as madrasas in an effort to secure support and cooperation of the ulema. Madrasas soon multiplied throughout the Islamic world, which helped to spread Islamic learning beyond urban centers and to unite diverse Islamic communities in a shared cultural project. Nonetheless, instruction remained focused on individual relationships between students and their teacher. The formal attestation of educational attainment, ijaza, was granted by a particular scholar rather than the institution, and it placed its holder within a genealogy of scholars, which was the only recognized hierarchy in the educational system. While formal studies in madrasas were open only to men, women of prominent urban families were commonly educated in private settings and many of them received and later issued ijazas in hadith studies, calligraphy and poetry recitation. Working women learned religious texts and practical skills primarily from each other, though they also received some instruction together with men in mosques and private homes. Madrasas were devoted principally to study of law, but they also offered other subjects such as theology, medicine, and mathematics. The madrasa complex usually consisted of a mosque, boarding house, and a library. It was maintained by a waqf (charitable endowment), which paid salaries of professors, stipends of students, and defrayed the costs of construction and maintenance. The madrasa was unlike a modern college in that it lacked a standardized curriculum or institutionalized system of certification. Muslims distinguished disciplines inherited from pre-Islamic civilizations, such as philosophy and medicine, which they called \\"sciences of the ancients\\" or \\"rational sciences\\", from Islamic religious sciences. Sciences of the former type flourished for several centuries, and their transmission formed part of the educational framework in classical and medieval Islam. In some cases, they were supported by institutions such as the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, but more often they were transmitted informally from teacher to student. The University of Al Karaouine, founded in 859 AD, is listed in The Guinness Book Of Records as the world's oldest degree-granting university.The Guinness Book Of Records, Published 1998, , p. 242 The Al-Azhar University was another early university (madrasa). The madrasa is one of the relics of the Fatimid caliphate. The Fatimids traced their descent to Muhammad's daughter Fatimah and named the institution using a variant of her honorific title Al-Zahra (the brilliant).Halm, Heinz. The Fatimids and their Traditions of Learning. London: The Institute of Ismaili Studies and I.B. Tauris. 1997. Organized instruction in the Al-Azhar Mosque began in 978. Ideas A madarasa of the Jamia Masjid mosque in Srirangapatna, India Syed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas described the Islamic purpose of education as a balanced growth of the total personality through training the spirit, intellect, rational self, feelings and bodily senses such that faith is infused into the whole personality. Seyyed Hossein Nasr stated that, while education does prepare humankind for happiness in this life, \\"its ultimate goal is the abode of permanence and all education points to the permanent world of eternity\\". According to the Nahj al-Balagha, there are two kinds of knowledge: knowledge merely heard and that which is absorbed. The former has no benefit unless it is absorbed. The heard knowledge is gained from the outside and the other is absorbed knowledge means the knowledge that raised from nature and human disposition, referred to the power of innovation of a person. The Quran is the optimal source of knowledge. For teaching Quranic traditions, the Maktab as elementary school emerged in mosques, private homes, shops, tents, and even outside. The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) has organized five conferences on Islamic education: in Mecca (1977), Islamabad (1980), Dhaka (1981), Jakarta (1982), and Cairo (1987). Modern Education in Islam In general, minority religious groups often have more education than a country's majority religious group, even more so when a large part of that minority are immigrants. This trend applies to Islam: Muslims in North America and Europe have more formal years of formal education than Christians. Furthermore, Christians have more formal years of education in many majority Muslim countries, such as in sub-Saharan Africa. However, global averages of education are far lower for Muslims than Jews, Christians, Buddhists and people unaffiliated with a religion. However, younger Muslims have made much larger gains in education than any of these other groups. There is a perception of a large gender gap in majority Islam countries, but this is not always the case. In fact, the quality of female education is more closely related to economic factors than religious factors. And, although the gender gap in education is real, it has been continuing to shrink in recent years. Women in all religious groups have made much larger educational gains in recent generations than men.

A new foundation was not envisaged but the North German Federation was to expand with the southern German states in order to form the German Empire.Vgl. hierzu Michael Kotulla, Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte.

North German Confederation (1867-1870), with Prussia (blue with a red border), green border around Bavaria with the Bavarian Palatinate, yellow border around Württemberg, brown border around Baden and dark brown around Hesse-Darmstadt. The November Treaties are detailed as follows: * The agreement between the North German Confederation and Baden and Hesse on the \\"founding\\" of the \\"German Confederation\\" (not to be confused with the German Confederation of 1815) on 15 November 1870.Protokoll, betreffend die Vereinbarung zwischen dem Norddeutschen Bunde, Baden und Hessen über Gründung des Deutschen Bundes und Annahme der Bundesverfassung vom 15. November 1870. * The treaty of the North German Confederation with Bavaria on 23 NovemberVertrag, betreffend den Beitritt Bayerns zur Verfassung des Deutschen Bundes, nebst Schlußprotokoll vom 23. November 1870. * The treaty of the North German Confederation with Württemberg on 25 November.Vertrag betreffend den Beitritt Württembergs zur Verfassung des Deutschen Bundes, nebst dazu gehörigem Protokoll vom 25. November 1870. As a result, the constitution of the North German Confederation had to be adapted. Many changes had already appeared in the constitution of the German Confederation of 1 January 1871, but Württemberg had already ratified the treaty, as a result of which the new constitution had already been overtaken. Bavaria did not follow the ratification until the end of January, but allowed the legal effect to start retroactively on 1 January. On 18 January 1871, the Emperor's proclamation in Versailles followed, which, from a legal point of view, did not constitute the founding of the empire, but a commission. The Constitution of the German Empire was adopted on 16 April to make constitutional law appropriate to the latest situation.  Background  = Franco-Prussian War = After the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the North German states had joined the North German Confederation under the leadership of Prussia. In 1870, France under Napoleon III declared war on Prussia and thus triggered the Franco-Prussian War. France was surprised by the fact that Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden and Hesse had joined Prussia, although there had been mutual covenants of protection and trusts since 1867. During the war, in which the Prussians won, a near-reaching agreement emerged and the road to founding the empire was opened. Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of the North German Confederation, pressed for diplomatic access to the remaining sovereign states, the Grand Duchy of Baden, the Grand Duchy of Hesse, the Kingdom of Württemberg and the Kingdom of Bavaria, in the sens of the Lesser German solution. Their governments differed in their unity. It therefore needed diplomatic skills to maintain the sovereignty of the southern German states at the same time and to anchor the unity of constitutional law. In addition, the foreign policies attracted the suspicion of the remaining European powers (Russian Empire, Austria-Hungary and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) and had to be avoided.Klaus Stern: Das Staatsrecht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland. Band V: Die geschichtlichen Grundlagen des deutschen Staatsrechts, C.H. Beck, München 2000, Rn 128. = Attitudes in Baden, Württemberg and Hesse = The Grand Duchy of Baden was unconditionally behind the unity. Grand Duke Frederick I and Prime Minister Julius Jolly articulated requests on 3 September 1870. They had already applied to be a part of the North German Confederation in 1867 and repeatedly during the Spring of 1870, which the North German government rejected Bismarck's foreign policy considerations.Klaus Stern: Das Staatsrecht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland. Band V: Die geschichtlichen Grundlagen des deutschen Staatsrechts, C.H. Beck, München 2000, Rn. 127. The Kingdom of Württemberg was supported by Greater Germany-Austria. Under the influence of the Württemberg German Party, the cabinet, governed by King Charles I, sent an envoy to the German headquarters in France on 12 September, to conduct negotiations with the North German Confederation about forming an association. The government of the Grand Duchy of Hesse supported the idea of a Greater Germany, but the Upper Hesse region and the troops of South Hesse belonged to the North German Confederation, which meant a certain predicament for the government under Grand Duke Louis III. The population and the successor to the throne, Louis IV, also supported the Lesser German solution. Accordingly, the government abandoned the Greater Germany idea and entered into negotiations with the North German Confederation. = Attitudes in Bavaria = The Kingdom of Bavaria was the most strongly opposed to all four sovereign states of a Lesser Germany. King Ludwig II was always concerned about independence. To avoid being isolated, Bavaria entered negotiations with the proposal of a new constitutional alliance. The constitutional alliance led to the founding a new federation with a new federal constitution. Bavaria were promised to maintain independence and integrity of Bavaria in a letter from the Prussian king. By virtue of the treaty on 23 November 1870, between the North German Confederation and the Kingdom of Bavaria, Bavaria also retained many other so- called reserve rights, such as its own army, postal system and its own state railway, in addition to cultural and fiscal sovereignty. In January 1871, the Bavarian parliament adopted this treaty after great resistance, especially from the Bavarian patriots. See also: History of Bavaria  Signing  From 22 to 26 September 1870, preparatory conferences took place in Munich. Bavaria's resistance faded, also due to talks by Otto von Bismarck in October and further influence on the Bavarian King Ludwig II. Baden and Hesse made applications for accession in October, so that pressure on Württemberg and Bavaria increased again. As of the end of October, negotiations at the German Headquarters near Versailles were held with authorised ministers from the four southern German states. Saxon representatives were also in attendance. At this time, the siege of Paris was still in full swing. The result of the negotiations was the unity of converting the North German Confederation into a German Confederation with the acceptance of the southern German states. The North German Confederation should be analogous to the German Federal Constitution. This result was concluded in the constitutional treaties of November 1870 and two separate military conventions with the four states which were to be joined: on 15 November, the treaty between the North German Confederation on the one hand and Baden and Hesse on the other were based on the unchanged acceptance of the North Germans. This changed the name of the North German Confederation to the German Confederation, even if the ratifications were still outstanding. After negotiations with Bavaria and Württemberg, the North German Federal Constitution and the most important laws of the North German Confederation were modified. In total, the federal elements were emphasised in comparison with the North German Confederation of 1867. On this new basis, Bavaria entered the agreement between the North- German Confederation and Baden and Hesse in Berlin on 23 November. Württemberg also followed on 25 November. All treaties came into force on 1 January 1871, which marks the formal birth of the German Empire. On 8 November, agreements with Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden and Hesse followed on the agreements between Württemberg, Baden and Hesse and the North German Confederation, respectively Bavaria and the North German Confederation. The November Treaties required the approval of the People's Representatives of the North German Confederation as well as the popular representations, as they created a new state with the German Confederation (the name was later changed) and amended the existing North German Federal Constitution. The parliaments of Württemberg, Baden and Hesse ratified the treaties in December 1870, Bavaria on 21 January 1871 with clear majorities. In the vote of the Northern German parliament after the third reading on 9 December 1870, the Polish, Danish and Welsh deputies voted in favour. Other opposing camps remained remote from the vote. On the same day, the Federal Council of the North German Confederation voted to change the designations to \\"German Empire\\" and \\"German Emperor\\". On 10 December 1870, the constitutional change passed through the Northern German parliament.  Integration  The so-called \\"Founding of the German Empire\\" prepared the November Treaties by regulating the conditions of acceptance by the southern states. At the same time, the constitution itself or the political system hardly changed. Of permanent importance were the special rules for some southern states, the so-called reserve rights. Württemberg and Bavaria were allowed to collect their own consumption tax and rail tariffs and received special rights to the postal and telegraph sectors. All three states were still allowed to maintain their own armies. These rights and other exceptions remained in place until 1918, although they did not appear in constitutional texts of 1 January and 16 April 1871 respectively. The founding of the German Empire was complete and was formed by a \\"foundation of the Empire from above\\",Tim Ostermann, Die verfassungsrechtliche Stellung des Deutschen Kaisers nach der Reichsverfassung von 1871, Peter Lang, Frankfurt am Main 2009, S. 19 f.; Hans-Peter Ullmann, Politik im Deutschen Kaiserreich: 1871–1918, 2.

The earliest cycle dates from 1953, the last was completed in 2008. He set poems by German romantic writers such as Friedrich Hölderlin and Joseph von Eichendorff, but was also inspired by French, Greek and Spanish poems, and by texts from the 20th-century poets Georg Trakl and Peter Härtling. He used mostly piano to accompany a singer, but also added percussion or other instruments, and scored some cycles in a version for voice and orchestra. His Hölderlin-Lieder, setting poems from the author's late period, were performed at major festivals and recorded.  Overview  Interested in poetry and the voice, Killmayer composed more than 200 Lieder, including several song cycles. Most of them are set for voice and piano. Many songs set poems from German romantic poetry, such as others on 20th-century poems. Killmayer wrote four cycles of Hölderlin-Lieder based on poems by Friedrich Hölderlin, especially from his late period, two cycles based on Georg Trakl (1993 and 1996), and one based on Peter Härtling (1993). Killmayer was first inspired by texts of French authors of the Renaissance, such as Charles d'Orléans, Mal Mariée and Clément Marot (1953), and by poems of Federico García Lorca in German (1954), which he set for soprano, piano, ensemble or percussion. From the 1990s, he composed cycles on poems by Stéphane Mallarmé and Sappho. Returning to German romanticism he set two song cycles based on poems by Joseph von Eichendorff for men's chorus, a songbook inspired by Heinrich Heine, a cycle based on poems and Eduard Mörike. His song cycles, as his other works, were published by Schott. The following table contains for every song cycle the title with translation, the year of composition, the text source and its language, voice type (soprano, coloratura soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor, baritone), and the number of movements. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" + Song cycles by Wilhelm Killmayer - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Translation ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Poems ! scope=\\"col\\"  Image poet ! scope=\\"col\\"  Language ! scope=\\"col\\"  Voice ! scope=\\"col\\"  Instrument(s) ! scope=\\"col\\"  Movements - id = 1 ! scope=\\"row\\"  ''''  Four Canzones on texts by Petrarch  1950  Petrarch  upright=0.4  Italian  mixed choir a cappella   four - id = 2 ! scope=\\"row\\"  '  Dreams  1953  French  upright=0.4  French  soprano   five - id = 2 ! scope=\\"row\\"  '  Romances  1954  Lorca  upright=0.4  German  soprano   five - id = 3 ! scope=\\"row\\"  '  Three chants after Hölderlin  1965  Hölderlin  upright=0.4  German  baritone  piano  three - id = 4 ! scope=\\"row\\"  ' (1965)  Three songs by Leopardi  1965  Leopardi  upright=0.4  Italian  baritone  orchestra  three - id = 5 ! scope=\\"row\\"  '   1968    French  soprano  Pierrot ensemble  six - id = 6 ! scope=\\"row\\"  '  French song book  1979–1980    German    nine - id = 7 ! scope=\\"row\\"   rowspan=3  Hölderlin Songs  1982–1985  rowspan=3  late Hölderlin  rowspan=3  upright=0.4  rowspan=3  German  rowspan=3  tenor  rowspan=2  piano or orchestra  19 - id = 8 ! scope=\\"row\\" ' (2)  1983–1987  18 - id = 9 ! scope=\\"row\\"  ' (3)  1983–1991  piano  seven - id = 10 ! scope=\\"row\\"  '  9 Songs to Poems from Peter Härtling  1993  Härtling  upright=0.4  German  mezzo-soprano  piano  nine - id = 11 ! scope=\\"row\\" '  Trakl Songs  1993  Trakl  upright=0.4  German  tenor  piano  eight - id = 12 ! scope=\\"row\\" '  Eight poems by Mallarmé  1993–1995  Mallarmé  upright=0.4  French  coloratura soprano  piano  eight - id = 13 ! scope=\\"row\\" '  Sappho Songs  1993–2008  Sappho  upright=0.4  German  soprano  piano  15 - id = 14 ! scope=\\"row\\" '  Heine Songs  1994–1995  Heine  upright=0.4  German  tenor  piano  37 - id = 15 ! scope=\\"row\\" '   1995–1997  rowspan=2  Eichendorff  rowspan=2  upright=0.4  German  men's chorus   eight - id = 16 ! scope=\\"row\\" '    German  men's chorus   eight - id = 17 ! scope=\\"row\\"  '  Silence and Childhood  1996  Trakl   German  tenor  piano  six - id = 18 ! scope=\\"row\\"  '  Mörike Songs  2003–2004  Mörike  upright=0.4  German  tenor  piano  15 }  Song cycles  = Vier Canzonen nach Texten von Petrarca = The cycle, composed in 1950, sets four poems by Petrarch for mixed choir a cappella: # # # # It was recorded in 2000 by chamber choir Josquin des Prèz under Uwe Witzel.CD: O viva morte, o dilettoso male: Die Liebesgedichte Francesco Petrarcas.

A tenor voice is accompanied by piano or orchestra. The orchestral version was premiered in Munich on 3 February 1986 by Peter Schreier with the Bayerisches Staatsorchester, conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch. The piano version was first performed on 23 August 1989 as part of the festival Frankfurt Feste, by Christoph Prégardien and Siegfried Mauser. A second cycle, setting 18 poems from his late period with the same scoring tenor voice was composed between 1982 and 1985. The orchestral version was premiered at the Salzburg Festival on 14 August 1987 by Peter Schreier and the ORF-Symphonieorchester, conducted by Lothar Zagrosek.

The singer recorded in 2010 four songs of the second cycle, together with songs by Robert Schumann and Gustav Mahler titled Wanderer, in an arrangement for small ensemble by the composer. A reviewer notes that Killmayer \\"demonstrates a real affinity with the Romantic poet\\" and describes the arrangement as \\"highly attractive scores with their spare and finely wrought chamber accompaniments\\". A third cycle, setting 7 poems from his late period for tenor and piano, was composed between 1983 and 1992. It was premiered in Vienna on 22 November 1991 Wien for Wien Modern by Prégardien and Mauser. It was recorded in 2017 by Markus Schäfer and Mauser, together with the two cycles after Trakl, in 2017, titled Sommersneige (Summer's End). Prégardien and Mauser recorded all three cycles in 1992. A reviewer for Gramophone notes that Killmayer thought of the poet's last period as \\"possessed by a special 'understanding of reality'\\". He describes \\"moments of dissonance, and unusual textural dispositions\\", but generally focused \\"on simple chordal and melodic patterns, not to create an atmosphere of expressionistic anguish, but to suggest a calm, joyous acceptance of the inevitable\\". = Neun Lieder nach Gedichten von Peter Härtling = The cycle ' was composed in 1993, setting nine poems by the contemporary author Peter Härtling: # # # # # # # # # It was premiered at the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart on 27 November 1993 by Mitsuko Shirai and Hartmut Höll. = Trakl-Lieder = The cycle ' was composed in 1993, setting eight poems by Trakl: # # # # # # # # It was premiered in the on 1 December 1998 by Christoph Prégardien and Siegfried Mauser.

It stood close to the northern portal of the 680 yard Mossgiel Tunnel that runs under the Mossgiel Ridge and Skeoch Hill north of Mauchline, East Ayrshire, Scotland. It may have solely served the transportation requirements of the Glasgow and South-Western Railway and its successor in connection with the carriage of workers involved in the ongoing maintenance and/or the major reconstruction of Mossgiel Tunnel that took place between 1925 and 1927. It was not recorded in the 1896 G&SWR; working time table and had closed sometime after July 1926. Garrochburn Goods Depot once stood near by on the B744 to the north, 6.82 from Kilmarnock and 2.72 from Mauchline. A line to Mauchline Colliery branched off close to the site of the station that opened in 1925 and closed to all traffic in February 1974 after serving as a coal washery for around 5 years after the colliery closed in 1969.  Infrastructure and working The OS maps of 1895 shows only Garrochburn signal box and signals in the area with a reservoir on the western side of the line and a small building opposite it on the eastern side in the immediate vicinity of the station site. By the 1920s only minor infrastructure was present with the double track main line and one siding running off to a loading dock to the west. Several semaphore signal posts and cross over points were present with runaway points located in the up line about 400yds towards Hurlford from the signal box. The siding at Garrochburn was also used as a coal siding for coal traffic to or from the nearby Mauchline Colliery. The gradient from Kilmarnock eased at Garrochburn Goods depot before a gentle descent into Mauchline following the passage through Mossgiel or Skeoch Tunnel.  History  The goods depot at Garrochburn was opened by the Glasgow and South-Western Railway in the 1920s and closed on 4 October 1965. Its construction may have been originally have been related to the reconstruction of Mossgiel Tunnel in the mid 1920s. Apart from farm traffic and the possible link with the reconstruction and relining of Mossgiel Tunnel the siding at Garrochburn was also used as a coal siding for coal traffic connected with the siding to Mauchline Colliery. As stated Mossgiel Tunnel Platform stood close by to the south, and had closed at some point after July 1926 by the LMS when the reconstruction of Mossgiel Tunnel had been completed. The station had only a single platform as the line itself had been singled during the work on the tunnel. A temporary signal box had been established to control the southern access to the tunnel during the relining, etc.RailScot Mossgiel Tunnel The site today The siding to Mauchline Colliery has been lifted and much of the track bed has grassed over. No remnants of the station are visible however the likely site is discernable as a wide area on the verge of the line.

It is a two-door 2+2 hard top convertible. The car is named after the village of Portofino in northern Italy and the car succeeds the company's previous V8 grand tourer, the California T. The car was unveiled at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. The 2020 Ferrari Roma coupe is based on the Portofino. Launch Rear view The Ferrari Portofino was unveiled on the Italian Riviera in the village of Portofino at two exclusive evenings on 7 and 8 September 2017, at which Piero Ferrari, Sergio Marchionne, Sebastian Vettel and Giancarlo Fisichella were present. It was also shown at Maranello on September 9 and 10 during the Ferrari 70th Anniversary celebration. By the end of 2017, the Portofino was unveiled in Asia, namely China and Japan, where China is said to be a big market for the car. In Japan, the vehicle was initially private- previewed in November, before the official debut in February 2018. Prices in Japan start from JPY25,300,000. Prices in the U.S. start from $215,000. In Hong Kong, the Portofino was launched in late March 2018, making it the third time in Ferrari's history to launch a new car in the Hong Kong's Peninsula Hotel (Enzo in 2003, followed by FF in 2010). Unlike previous occasions where the vehicle launch occurred in only one part of the ground floor lobby, the Portofino's launch occupied the hotel's entire ground floor area, where a few other Ferrari models were also parked outside the drop-off area, and creative lighting featuring the Ferrari's Prancing Horse logo was also projected on the hotel's exterior walls. A China-spec, left-hand drive model was displayed, which features a simplified Chinese menu display—a rare move for Ferrari as not all Chinese-speaking Asian regions would receive a Chinese language menu. Pricing for the Portofino in Hong Kong (as of April 2018) starts from HK$3.5M, with deliveries scheduled later in the year. A proper right-hand drive model was first spotted at the city's 488 Pista launch event on late June 2018. Specifications = Chassis and body = The chassis of the Portofino is made of 12 different aluminium alloys with much of its components now being integrated. The A-pillar of its predecessor consisted of 21 separate components but it is now a single piece in the Portofino. Hollow castings allow for increased structural rigidity, increasing it by 35% over its predecessor, the Ferrari California T. Its body has . =Weight= Weight saving has been kept in focus while the development of the Portofino was carried out. Ferrari engineers managed to shave weight from the powertrain, dashboard structure, air-conditioning and heating and electronic systems of the car resulting in a weight of , making the car lighter than its predecessor. =Engine, transmission and performance= The 3.9-litre F154BD twin-turbocharged V8 engine The engine, a Ferrari F154BE twin-turbocharged V8, is the same as in the Ferrari GTC4Lusso T, but yields a slightly de-tuned power output of at 7,500 rpm and of torque at 3,000 to 5,250 rpm. Changes to the engine include a 10% pressure increase in the combustion chamber, revised connecting rods and pistons and a single cast exhaust manifold. The car retains the 7-speed dual clutch transmission from its predecessor but features a new software to allow for faster gear shifts. The exhaust system has been tweaked to give the car a proper sound note while maintaining its grand touring nature, featuring an adjustable electric bypass valve that monitors the engine's sound according to driving conditions. The Portofino can accelerate from in 3.5 seconds, in 10.8 seconds and can attain a top speed of . =Suspension and steering= The Portofino features magnetorheological dampers, a carryover from the California, with an improved software to maintain good ride quality even though having a stiffer suspension system than the California. Like the company's V12 grand tourer 812 Superfast, the Portofino features an electrically assisted power steering. Both the suspension system and steering become increasingly responsive when the car is in sports mode. =Interior= The interior of the Portofino was developed after taking input from various clients. The rear seats have increased legroom (by 5 centimeters) and the infotainment system is more advanced and easier to use, featuring a 10.2-inch display screen in the centre console with Apple CarPlay functionality, as in its predecessor. The air conditioning system has been refined as well and is now 25% faster and 50% quieter than the California's. Ferrari Portofino M On 16 September 2020, Car and Driver reported the launch of the Portofino M (Modificata or modified). The power was increased to 612 horse-power and will be released in the middle of 2021. Awards On 9 July 2018, Ferrari received the Red Dot: Best of the Best award for the Portofino's groundbreaking design. The international judging panel stated that the Portofino “embodies an impressive evolutionary advancement\\" and \\"fascinates with an exciting design language,\\" with the vehicle's elegance \\"further underscored by the uncompromising quality in material and workmanship.\\" References External links * Portofino Category:Grand tourers Category:Hardtop convertibles Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Cars introduced in 2017 Category:2020s cars ","title":"Ferrari Portofino"},{"id":"55001902","text":"The Badarpur Dullabcherra Passenger is a passenger train belonging to Northeast Frontier Railway of Indian Railways that runs between Dullavcherra and Badarpur Junction.

Life  Johannes Steger was born in Zeulenroda, a small town in the Thuringian countryside to the south of Leipzig in central southern Germany. His father was a clock maker and the deacon of a free-church community. The boy grew up in a strict religiously oriented family. Between 1921 and 1926 Steger was apprenticed as a carver of wooden figures and then, on successful completion of the apprenticeship, was employed at this craft. Between November 1927 and the summer of 1928 he attended the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts where he studied under Georg Wrba, a leading sculptor and graphic artist of the time. Then, between October 1929 and 1932, he attended the Combined National Academy for Pure and Applied Arts (\\"Vereinigte Staatsschulen für freie und angewandte Kunst\\") in Berlin. Here he was taught by Wilhelm Gerstel. Between 1932 and 1937 he worked as a freelance sculptor. From 1934 he had his own studio in Weimar where, between 1937 and 1939, he attended classes with Emil Hipp at the Arts Academy. War broke out in 1939: between June 1940 and June 1945 Steger undertook his military service. Between 1945 and 1954 he again worked as a freelance sculptor in his home region which, since May 1945, had been administered as the Soviet occupation zone and then, in October 1949, was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1954 he was appointed to a professorship at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. In 1960 he won a Trade Union Federation Arts Prize. Hans Steger died at Dresden on 9 January 1968.  Works  The focus of Steger's work was on portrait sculptures. In that respect he considered himself closely connected with the Realism tradition that had been a feature of German sculpture during the first half of the twentieth century. Important influences were Wilhelm Gerstel, Hermann Blumenthal, Fritz Cremer, Waldemar Grzimek and Wilhelm Lehmbruck. However, he developed his own style which went beyond being merely derivative.  Personal  Hans Steger was married with four daughters and one son.

He is the middle child of three, to parents Kevin and Esme, and brother of ex Irish international tennis player James Cluskey. After attending St Colmcilles boys National School in Swords, he then went to Belvedere College in Dublin city centre.  Accident  At the age of 18, Cluskey was about to enter into his leaving certificate year in Belvedere College when he suffered a catastrophic spinal cord injury. Cluskey was out camping with friends and fell from a hay bale, breaking his neck at the C2, C3, C4 and C5 levels. He was taken to the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin and later transferred to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire to undergo physical and occupational therapy. Advocacy work Cluskey has been involved in a number of disability related advocacy actions. In 2013, after getting stranded on a night out trying to get a wheelchair accessible taxi, he lobbied the government and was appointed by Minister Alan Kelly to the taxi advisory committee and by current Irish Taoiseach prime minister Leo Varadkar to help put more wheelchair accessible taxis on Irish roads. Rise to fame In April 2017, Cluskey was invited to appear on the Irish chat show The Late Late Show. This brought him to public attention. As part of the segment, he was joined by TV presenter Kathryn Thomas and ex-Irish international football star Kevin Kilbane who both undertook a challenge to experience life in a wheelchair. Before this, he had devised Rugbys Wheelchair Challenge, which challenged Irish rugby stars Jamie Heaslip, Shane Byrne, Felix Jones and David Wallace to travel from the Aviva Stadium in Dublin to Thomond Park in Limerick and aired on the Irish national broadcaster TV3. The show was produced by Loosehorse productions and went on to be nominated for an IFTA award for Best Reality TV Show.

It is found in shola habitat in a small section of the Western Ghats in southwestern Karnataka and northern Kerala. It was formerly considered a subspecies of the black-chinned laughingthrush. Taxonomy The Banasura laughingthrush was described by zoologist Edward Blyth in 1851, based on a type specimen collected at Banasura Hill in modern-day Kerala by Thomas Jerdon.Blyth, E. (1851). Notice of a collection of Mammalia, birds, and reptiles, procured at or near the station of Chérra Punji in the Khásia Hills, north of Sylhet. Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal XX (Part II): 517–524. Blythe originally placed it in the genus Garrulax. After a period of taxonomic reorganization, the species, along with the Palani laughingthrush and the Ashambu laughingthrush, was placed in the genus Montecincla, in which it remains today. The Banasura laughingthrush was formerly treated as conspecific with the Nilgiri laughingthrush, and was known as the black- chinned laughingthrush. However, morphological and geographic analysis revealed that the Banasura and Nilgiri laughingthrushes were better treated as different species entirely, due to apparent allopatric speciation,Praveen, J., and P. O. Nameer (2013). Strophocincla laughingthrushes of south India: a case for allopatric speciation and impact on their conservation.

Two new genera of songbirds represent endemic radiations from the Shola Sky Islands of the Western Ghats, India. BMC Evolutionary Biology 17: 31. The Banasura laughingthrush is genetically most closely related to the Nilgiri laughingthrush, and the two species are estimated to have diverged about 330,000 years before the present. Description The Banasura laughingthrush is a medium-sized songbird, ranging between 203 and 230 cm in length, and between 36 and 52 g in mass. Adults have a black face and throat; white supercilia; a gray breast, cheeks, and back; an ochre belly; and olive back, wings, and tail. Additionally, adults have a black bill, crimson irises, and brownish legs. It is distinguished from the Nilgiri laughingthrush by its gray breast, and from the Palani and Ashambu laughingthrushes by its black chin. The sexes are indistinguishable in plumage.Praveen J. (2020). Banasura Laughingthrush (Montecincla jerdoni), version 2.0. In Birds of the World (P. G. Rodewald, B. K. Keeney, and S. M. Billerman, Editors). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.2173/bow.bkclau1.02 While the Banasura laughingthrush is extremely similar in appearance to other species within Montecincla, it is the only species of its genus found within its range, making identification straightforward. Distribution and habitat The Banasura laughingthrush has an extremely restricted range. It is endemic to a small series of sky islands in the Western Ghats in South India, between the Brahmagiri Hills of Kodagu in the north and Vavul Mala in Kerala in the south. Within this range, fragmented populations are found at Banasura Hill in Wayanad, Chembra Peak, and Vellarimala. The Banasura laughingthrush is primarily found in shola habitat between 1,400 and 2,400 meters in elevation. Behavior and ecology The Banasura laughingthrush forages in the shola midstory and lower canopy by hopping among branches, feeding primarily on fruits and insects. Individual birds are fairly sedentary, and do not regularly travel between sholas. Like other Montecincla laughingthrushes, the Banasura laughingthrush is highly vocal. The most typical song type is a series of 3 to 6 loud, nasally whistles, but this song is highly variable, with various 2, 3, 4, and 6-note songs being well documented. While the Banasura laughingthrush's song cannot always be distinguished from that of the Nilgiri laughingthrush, analyses have shown the Banasura laughingthrush's song to be generally higher in complexity than any of the other Montecincla laughingthrushes. Conservation Due to its extremely small range of under 57 km², the population of the Banasura laughingthrush is estimated at only around 500-2,500 adults.The Banasura laughingthrush's range is also highly fragmented, rendering the species even more vulnerable to declines due to habitat loss and degradation. Due to its small population size and range, the species is ranked by the IUCN as Endangered.BirdLife International (2020). Species factsheet: Montecincla jerdoni. The Carmel Hump Mountains Important Bird Area was designated specifically to protect crucial habitat for the Banasura laughingthrush.

History In Novocherkassk, on Pochtovaya Street at the distance of 300 metres from each other there were two St. Nicholas' churches: one was Orthodox on Nikolskaya Square (now Levski Square), and the other belonged to Old Believers community and was situated at the Alexander Garden. The foundation stone of the wooden Church of St. Nicholas was solemnly laid down on August 14, 1810. The church was built in 1812. This church was erected at the insistence of the parishioners of St. Nicholas Church in Cherkassk, who were almost forcibly transferred to Novocherkassk on the order of ataman Matvey Platov. The construction was supervised by engineer- lieutenant-colonel Efimov. On July 22, 1812, the priest Nikolai Dolotin consecrated the newly built church. The construction of a new stone church began in 1821, and it was consecrated in 1829. This church had two chapels: the right one was dedicated in honour of Holy Great Martyr Varvara and the left one ― in honour of the Assumption of Mother of God. The project of the church was designed by architect Amvrosimov in Empire style. This church was one-storeyed, single-domed and built of white stone. The bell tower was attached to the main building. The church was closed in 1935, and in 1939 it was dismantled. Now in Novocherkassk there is Levski Square at the place of it. On 19 November 1995 a large wooden cross was erected in memory of the ruined church of St. Nicholas. Later the wooden cross was replaced by a metal one.

There are three main types of non-canonical base pairs: those stabilized by polar hydrogen bonds, those having interactions among C−H and O/N groups, and those that have hydrogen bonds between the bases themselves. The first discovered non- canonical base pairs are Hoogsteen base pairs, which were first described by American biochemist Karst Hoogsteen. Non-canonical base pairings commonly occur in the secondary structure of RNA (e.g. pairing of G with U), and in tRNA recognition. They are typically less stable than standard base pairings. The presence of non-canonical base pairs in double stranded DNA results in a disrupted double helix.  History  James Watson and Francis Crick published the double helical structure of DNA and proposed the canonical Watson-Crick base pairs in 1953. Ten years later, in 1963, Karst Hoogsteen reported that he had used single crystal X-ray diffraction to investigate alternative base pair structures, and he found an alternative structure for the nucelobase pair adenine-thymine in which the purine (A) takes on an alternative conformation with respect to the pyrimidine (T). Five years after Hoogsteen proposed the A-T Hoogsteen base pair, optical rotary dispersion spectra which provided evidence for a G-C Hoogsteen base pair were reported. The G-C Hoogsteen base pair was first observed via X-ray crystallography years later, in 1986, by co- crystallizing DNA with triostin A (an antibiotic). Ultimately, after years of studying both Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen base pairs, it has been determined that both occur naturally in DNA, and that they exist in equilibrium with one another; the conditions in which the DNA exists ultimately determine which form will be favored. Since the structures of the canonical Watson-Crick and non-canonical Hoogsteen base pairs were determined, many other types of non- canonical base pairs have been presented and described.  Structure  = Base pairing = Figure 2: Base pairing edge of nucleobases. Top figure is an example of a purine (Adenine) where the edges are known as Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen, and Sugar Edges. Bottom figure is an example of a Pyrimidine (Cytosine) with the Watson-Crick, C-H, and Sugar Edges An estimated 60% of bases in structured RNA participate in canonical Watson-Crick base pairs. Base pairing occurs when two bases form hydrogen bonds with each other. These hydrogen bonds can be either polar or non-polar interactions. The polar hydrogen bonds are formed by N-H...O/N and/or O-H...O/N interactions. Non- polar hydrogen bonds are formed between C-H...O/N.  Edge interactions  Each base has three potential edges where it can interact with another base. The Purine bases have 3 edges which are able to hydrogen bond. Those are known as the Watson-Crick edge(WC), the Hoogsteen edge(H), and the Sugar edge(S). Pyrimidine bases also have three hydrogen-bonding edges. Like the Pyrimidine there is the Watson-Crick edge(WC) and the Sugar edge(S) but the third edge is referred to as the \\"C-H\\" edge(H). This C-H edge is sometimes also referred to as the Hoogsteen edge for simplicity. There various edges for the Purine and Pyrimidine bases are shown in Figure 2. Figure 3: Cis and Trans Orientations of the glycosidic bond in RNA base pairs. Besides the three edges of interaction Base pairs also vary in various cis/trans forms. The cis and trans structures depend on the orientation of the ribose sugar as compared to the hydrogen bond interaction. These various orientations are shown in Figure 3. With the cis/trans forms and the 3 edges of hydrogen bonding there are 12 basic types of base pairing geometries which can be found in RNA structures. Those 12 types are WC:WC (cis/trans), W:HC (cis/trans), WC:S (cis/trans), H:S (cis/trans), H:H (cis/trans), and S:S (cis/trans).  Classification  These 12 types can be further divided into more subgroups which are dependent on the directionality of the glycosidic bonds and steric extensions. With all of the various base pair combinations there are 169 theoretically possible base pair combinations. The number of actual base pair combinations is however much lower since some of the combinations result in non-favorable interactions. This number of possible non-canonical base pairs is still being determined since it is very dependent on the base pairing criteria. Understanding the base pair configuration is difficult since the pairing is very dependent on the bases surroundings. These surroundings consist of adjacent base pairs, adjacent loops, or third interaction such as a base triple. Figure 4: 6 rigid-body parameters Since the various bases are rigid and planar, the bonding between them bases are well defined. The spatial interactions between the two bases can be classified in 6 rigid-body parameters or intra-base pair parameters (3 translational, 3 rotational) as shown in Figure 4. These parameters describe the base pairs three dimensional confirmation. The three translational arrangements are known as shear, stretch, and stagger. These three parameters are directly related to the proximity and direction of the pairs hydrogen bonding. The rotational arrangements are buckle, propeller, and opening. Rotational arrangements relate to the non-planar confirmation as compared to the ideal coplanar geometry. Intra-base pair parameters are used to determine the structure and stabilities of non-canonical base pairs. These parameters were originally created for the base pairings in DNA but can also fit the non-canonical base models. = Types = The most common non-canonical base pairs are trans A:G Hoogsteen/sugar edge, A:U Hoogsteen/WC, and G:U Wobble pairs.  Hoogsteen base pairs  Figure 5: An example of non-canonical base pairing. Shown is a Hoogsteen AU base pair. Hoogsteen base pairs occur between adenine (A) and thymine(T), and guanine (G) and cytosine(C), similarly to Watson-Crick base pairs; however, the purine takes on an alternative conformation with respect to the pyrimidine. In the A-U Hoogsteen base pair, the adenine is rotated 180° about the glycosidic bond, resulting in an alternative hydrogen bonding scheme which has one hydrogen bond in common with the Watson-Crick base pair (adenine N6 and thymine N4), while the other, instead of occurring between adenine N1 and thymine N3 as in the Watson-Crick base pair, occurs between adenine N7 and thymine N3. The A-U base pair is shown in Figure 5. In the G-C Watson-Crick base pair, similarly to the A-T Hoogsteen base pair, the purine (guanine) is rotated 180° about the glycosidic bond while the pyrimidine (cytosine) remains in place. One hydrogen bond from the Watson-Crick base pair is maintained (guanine O6 and cytosine N4) and the other occurs between guanine N7 and a protonated cytosine N3 (note that the Hoogsteen G-C base pair has two hydrogen bonds, while the Watson-Crick G-C base pair has three). Figure 6: Four examples of wobble base pairs.  Wobble base pairs  Wobble base pairing occur between two nucleotides that are not Watson-Crick base pairs. The 4 main examples are guanine-uracil (G-U), hypoxanthine-uracil (I-U), hypoxanthine- adenine (I-A), and hypoxanthine-cytosine (I-C). These wobble base pairs are very important in tRNA. Most organisms have less than 45 tRNA molecules but 61 tRNA molecules would be necessary to canonically pair to the codon. Wobble base pairing was proposed by Watson in 1966. Wobble base pairing allows for the 5' anticodon to non-standard base pair. Examples of wobble base pairs are given in Figure 6.  3-D Structure  Secondary and three-dimensional structures of RNA are formed and stabilized through non-canonical base pairs. Base pairs make up many secondary structural blocks which aid the folding of RNA complexes and three dimensional structures. The overall folded RNA is stabilized by the tertiary and secondary structures canonically base pairing together. Due to the many non-canonical base pairs there are an unlimited amount of structures which allow for the diverse functions of RNA. The arrangement of the non-canonical bases allow long-range RNA interactions, recognition of proteins and other molecules, and structural stabilizing elements. Many of the common non-canonical base pairs can be added to a stacked RNA stem without disturbing its helical character. = Secondary = Figure 7: This depicts a hairpin structure found in pre m-RNA Basic secondary structural elements of RNA include bulges, double helices, hairpin loops and internal loops. An example of a hairpin loop of RNA is given in Figure 7. As shown in the figure hairpin loops and internal loops require a sudden change in backbone direction. Non-canonical base pairing allows for increased flexibility at junctions or turns in the secondary structure. = Tertiary = Figure 8: An example of a Pseudoknot three-dimensional structure. Three- dimensional structures are formed through the long-range intra-molecular interactions between the secondary structures. This leads to the formation of pseudoknots, ribose zippers, kissing hairpin loops, or co-axial pseudocontinuous helices. The three-dimensional structures of RNA are primarily determined through molecular simulations or computationally guided measurements. An example of a Pseudoknot is given in Figure 8.  Experimental Methods  Watson-Crick canonical base pairing is not the only edge-to-edge conformation possible for the nucleotide since non-canonical pairing can take place as well. Sugar-phosphate backbone has an ionic character, which makes the bases sensitive to their environment, leading to conformational changes, such as non-canonical pairing. There are various methods of prediction for these conformations, such as NMR structure determination and X-ray crystallography.  Applications  RNA has many purposes throughout the cell including many important steps in gene expression. Various conformations of the non-Watson-Crick base pairs allow for a multitude of biological functions such as mRNA splicing, siRNA, transport, protein recognition, protein binding, and translation. One example of a biological application of non-canonical base pairs in the kink turn. A kink-turn is found throughout many functional RNA species. It consists of a three-nucleotide bilge which is due to three Hoogsteen base pairs. This kink-turn acts as a marker where various proteins can bind such as the human 15-5k protein or proteins in the L7Ae family. A similar scenario is described in the binding of the HIV-1 Rev-response element (RRE) RNA. The RNA has an extra wide deep groove that is caused by cis Watson- Crick G:A pair followed by a trans Watson-Crick G:G. The HIV-1 Rev-response element is then able to bind due to the deepened groove.

He emigrated to the United States in 1927, and worked with his father on projects in New Haven, Connecticut and elsewhere. He was hired as a carver by the John Donnelly Company, and moved to Washington, D.C. in 1932 to work on the U.S. Supreme Court Building. Morigi carved the eight marble relief panels on the bases of the twin lampstands that flank the Supreme Court's plaza. He may have carved the marble portions of the twin flagpole bases.Supreme Court flagpole bases, from SIRIS. He did interior work on the building, including carving in marble sculptor Adolph A. Weinman's larger-than-life relief sculpture of Moses--one of eighteen figures in the Courtroom's Great Lawmakers of History Frieze.Courtroom Friezes: South and North Walls, (PDF) from Supreme Court of the United States. Sculptor C. Paul Jennewein modeled The Four Elements, a set of Art Deco female nudes, for the fifth-floor lobby of what is now the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building.Department of Justice Building: Four Elements, from SIRIS. Morigi carved the allegorical figures in limestone, assisted by Bruno Mankowshi and William Kapp. They all collaborated (with Otto Thieleman) on carving in limestone Jennewein's architrave over the building's Constitution Avenue entrance. For the entrance to what is now the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse, Jennewein modeled the Trylon of Freedom, a 24-foot (7.32 m), three-sided freestanding column. Each side represented a branch of the federal government, illustrated in relief vignettes. Morigi was its principal carver, with assistance from contractor Vincent Torelli. Jennewein also modeled four half-life-sized allegorical figures representing The Four Freedoms for one of the courtrooms, and Morigi carved them in marble.

They were installed on ornate corbels above the pointed arches of the Nave's north and south side aisles. =Frederick Hart= After being rejected several times by Morigi, a 23-year-old Frederick Hart began an apprenticeship under him in 1967. Morigi started his student with minor challenges, carving floral or geometric work or ceiling bosses, and gradually gave him more responsibility. Morigi encouraged him to enter the 1971 design competition to create the three tympana for the West Portal. After three years, and multiple rounds of revisions, Hart was awarded the commission.Frederick Quinn, A House of Prayer for All People: A History of Washington National Cathedral (New York: Church Publishing, Inc., 2014), p. 143. Hart's famous design for the central tympanum, Ex Nihilo, featured nebulous figures floating in a swirling mass. Morigi carved Hart's related trumeau figure of Adam (1974–78) - eyes closed, not yet fully formed, \\"still in a state of becoming\\"Michael Novak, Frederick Hart: Changing Tides (Hudson Hill Press, 2005), p. 27. - for the pier between the Cathedral's main doors.Ex Nihilo, from Washington National Cathedral. Adam was the last work Morigi completed prior to retirement--he quipped: \\"I finished where God began.\\"Obituary: \\"Stone Carver R. Morigi Dies,\\" The Washington Post, January 13, 1995. =Personal= Vincent Palumbo succeeded Morigi as the Cathedral's master carver in 1978. Folklorist Marjorie Hunt spent years interviewing the carvers, and made them the subject of her PhD dissertation. She interviewed Morigi and Palumbo in The Stone Carvers: Master Craftsmen of Washington National Cathedral, a 1984 documentary film by Paul Wagner, that won the 1985 Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject.The Stone Carvers, from Washington National Cathedral. Hunt adapted her work into a 1999 book. Morigi lived in Hyattsville, Maryland, with his wife Louise and children Francis and Elayne. He was an avid golfer. Carver John Guarente caricatured Morigi in a 1960s gargoyle, portraying him as a devil holding carving tools and wearing a golf cap. To depict his notorious temper, Guarente carved a mushroom cloud bursting out of the top of his head.Ken Ringle, \\"Carving out a niche at the Cathedral,\\" The Washington Post, November 18, 1999. \\"The Master Carver Gargoyle\\" is now one of the Cathedral's most popular sculptures. Morigi died January 12, 1995, of emphysema. Quotes *\\"A stone carver is inclined to be an honest man. An executive may embellish his résumé, but a stone carver's work is there for all to see. No matter how well he writes, it does not change the quality of the carving.\\"William H. Shore, The Cathedral Within: Transforming Your Life by Giving Something Back (Random House, 2001), p. 268. *\\"You don't teach anybody to carve. You give them the fundamentals of carving, like you take a hammer and a point and you hit, you take a chisel and cut. But the main thing in carving, you steal carving. [Y]ou have two or three carvers working in the same place, so you watch one, you watch the other; you steal a little bit from one, you steal a little bit from the other. Then you put it all together yourself. You develop your own technique.\\" *\\"Technique is different one man to another. Two, three, four, five carvers can carve the same thing, but every one of them would have a different touch, what we call a touch, you know, a certain technique that differentiates the one from the other one and the other one. It's just like you sign your own name.\\" *\\"The drawing is the most important thing. The architect makes the drawing, and you've got to go by that. You're not doing it on your own. Each stone has its own design. Each stone has to fit.\\" *\\"You have to have the ability to understand and interpret each different sculptor's style. You have to change your own technique to please the sculptor. When you work [from] a model, you've got to pay attention to the form and get the form like the model. You can't stick the stone back like clay. You cut one time, and that's it; it's down on the floor. You've got to restrain yourself and be sure that you do what's in the model, that you copy the model to perfection.\\" *\\"You cut and cut and all of a sudden you see something grow. The more you work, the better it comes out. You feel good inside. You work, it gets brilliant, you see it move. I don't know, it fills you with some kind of emotion--such a sense of satisfaction.\\"Marjorie Hunt, \\"Delight in Skill: The Stone Carvers' Art,\\" in The Individual and Tradition: Folkloric Perspectives, Ray Cashman, et al., eds., (Indiana University Press, 2011), pp. 47-69.

He was the Mayor of Santander between 2007 and 2016 and served as Minister of Public Works from November 4, 2016 to June 1, 2018. Biography Although born in Bilbao, he has been a resident of Santander during all of his life. An only child, he attended the San Agustín College in the Cantabrian capital and spend his COU year in Ohio, United States as an exchange student, before joining the University of Cantabria School of Civil Engineering, where he graduated as civil engineer. He worked in the Apia XXI engineering office. His career in politics began in 1999 when he was named chief of the cabinet of the Councilor of Environment of the Government of Cantabria, José Luis Gil. In 2003 he took the office of the Department of Environment, Water and Beaches in the City Council of Santander. In 2004, he was elected Deputy Secretary of the People's Party of Cantabria, and later contested the municipal elections of 2007. Íñigo de la Serna was elected Mayor of Santander, obtaining 15 of the 27 councilors/aldermans (the PSC-PSOE obtained 7 and the PRC the remaining 5). When he was elected, he became the second youngest mayor of a provincial capital of Spain after Agustín Conde (Conde was elected Mayor of Toledo in 1995 with 30 years), since he was only 36 years old. He obtained an absolute majority with 52% of the votes, this was the first time that this had happened. In the municipal elections of 2011, he revalidated an absolute majority, more broadly, obtaining 18 of the 27 councilors (the PSC-PSOE obtained 5 and the PRC the remaining 4). He became the fourth most voted mayor of Spain obtaining the highest record of his party in the city with 56% of the votes. As mayor, and thanks to the implementation of the European project SmartSantander, he strongly opted to turn Santander into a referent within the so-called smart cities. In this sense, he advocated from his position as President of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR) to promote technological interoperability between the different cities of the European Union that would allow the sharing of information and projects in the field of smart cities. In June 2012, he was elected president of the Spanish Network of Smart Cities. In the municipal elections of 2015, he lost the absolute majority and remained with 13 aldermans and the 40% of the votes, the best result in a provincial capital for the PP after the fate suffered by the party across Spain. He was reelected mayor thanks to an agreement with the two aldermans from Citizens and that causes all the opposition to vote to its own candidates in the vote of investiture, ruling in minority. The rest of the corporation was made up of 5 PSC-PSOE councilors, 4 from the Regionalist Party of Cantabria, 1 from Ganemos Santander (regional branch of the national party Podemos), 1 from United Left and 1 independent. From July 23, 2012 to September 19, 2015, he also held the position of President of the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces (FEMP), following the voluntary resignation of the former President, Juan Ignacio Zoido, being unanimously elected by the members belonging to all the political parties that form the Territorial Council of the same. On September 19, 2015, the presidency of the FEMP was left in the hands of the Socialist, Abel Caballero. He was at the helm of the Spanish Network of Smart Cities since its foundation in 2012 until May 2016. He has also held the presidency of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions. As mayor he supported the construction of the Botín Center of Art and Culture in a very central zone of the city. after several years of delay. On November 4, 2016, he was appointed Minister of Public Works of the Government of Spain. 35 days after losing the absolute majority and being mayor of Santander, he supported the creation of a parliamentary commission of investigation on the accident of the Alvia; 180 days later, being minister, he refused to the creation of this commission. After 132 days at the helm of the ministry, he was the third minister to have a Royal Decree-Law rejected by the Cortes, the first in a normal functioning state of government. After supporting María José Sainz de Buruaga in the party's regional congress of Cantabria, the biggest political crisis in the 21st century of the PP of Cantabria took place. He has also been identified as a possible responsible for the taxi/Uber/Cabify conflict. In August 2017, less than 2 months before the date of the referendum of independence of Catalonia, he announced the presence of the Civil Guard in the security control of the Barcelona Airport after a labor dispute that caused a strike by the security guards.

(From North to South: Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria.) The \\"Austerlitz format\\" or \\"North- Trilateral\\" or \\"Slavkov trilateral\\" is a loose cooperation between the Central European States Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria.  Name  The name derives from the South Moravian city Austerlitz. It is known for the Battle of Austerlitz of 1805, which is also called the \\"Battle of the Three Emperors\\".  Background  In the form of the Visegrád Group an agreement had already existed since 15 February 1991 on cooperation between the Central European countries Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. In particular, it was a concern to expand this group to include Slovenia and Austria. On 3 April 2014, the Czech President Miloš Zeman announced at a press conference in Ljubljana, Slovenia, that Slovenia and Austria will also participate in the meetings of an enlarged Visegrád group in the future. However, the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by his spokesman, Gábor Kaleta, circulated on 4 April 2014 To understand that an expansion of the Visegrád Group is not planned and thus rejected Zeman's offer to Slovenia and Austria. Apart from Hungary's reluctance to include Slovenia and Austria in the Visegrád Group, the different points of view regarding the Russian sanctions in the wake of the Ukraine conflict on the one hand and the three states of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria on the other proved to be an obstacle on the way To an expansion of the Visegrád group. It was therefore necessary to find a different framework for enhanced cooperation. On January 29, 2015, the Prime Minister of Czech Republic Bohuslav Sobotka and Slovakia Robert Fico and the Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann came together in Slavkov u Brna, Austerlitz near Brno. The 'Austerlitz Declaration' was signed and the Austerlitz format was launched. Petr Drulák, the deputy minister of the Czech Republic, emphasized, however, that the Austerlitz format was not a competition, but an addition to the Visegrád group.

The current club was established by the issue of letters patent by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Ontario dated 28 May 1927. Since its founding, the Leander Boat Club has produced a number of National, World and Olympic Champion rowers and crews. The club takes its name from an earlier Leander Rowing Club near that site of the current boathouse that has a namesake in the original Leander Club, one of the oldest and currently the premier rowing club in the United Kingdom.

Just Like Mom and Dad, hosted by husband and wife duo Sandy Jobin-Bevans and Kylee Evans, is a 20-episode primetime family game show that premiered in January 2018. Each episode of Just Like Mom and Dad features three parent-child pairs competing in three rounds of interactive challenges, all designed to determine how well parents and kids really know each other, running just like the original 1980s version. Correct answers for the first round of questions were worth 5 and 10 points, and 15 and 20 seconds in the second round. In the taste test, the parents tasted all three treats prepared by the children in the Bake-Off round, then tried to guess which one their child made by holding up numbered paddles, with the team with the lowest score going first. A correct match earned 50 points. The winning team then faced a 12-section wheel spun by the child, winning whatever prize it landed on. The top prize was an all-inclusive family vacation to a tropical destination sponsored by Sunwing Airlines, much like the coveted trip to Walt Disney World offered in the original version. The original Canadian series Just Like Mom ran more than 600 episodes over five seasons from 1980 to 1985 on CTV. marblemedia secured all remake and development rights in 2009 in an agreement with CTV's parent company, Bell Media; as part of the agreement, Bell Media is credited as a production company in the revival of the series.

The current building dates from the seventeenth century.  History  The Lygon Arms was built in the 14th century and was a key connection between Wales, Worcester and London during the Elizabethan period. The earliest written record of the inn dates to 1377 and refers to the building as \\"The White Hart\\". However, the listing dates the current structure to the early seventeenth century. The coaching inn played a role in the English Civil War in 1649, serving both sides. Oliver Cromwell stayed there before the Battle of Worcester in 1651. Charles I also used it as a place to meet his supporters during the unrest. The inn continued to be used as a staging post into the eighteenth century for mail coaches travelling between London and Wales. By the 1900s, the Lygon Arms was owned by Sydney Bolton Russell, whose son, Gordon Russell, restored antique furniture for the hotel in a loft above the coach house. Gordon Russell would become one of England’s leading designers in the 1930s. King Edward VII visited the hotel between 1905 and 1910, as did his grandson, the future Edward VIII. In 1963 Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor stayed at the hotel during the height of the scandal surrounding their affair. The hotel has also been visited by Prince Philip, Evelyn Waugh, and Kylie Minogue.  Development  Sydney Bolton Russell (1866–1938) bought the Lygon Arms in 1903 from the Midlands brewer Samuel Allsopp & Sons, after first visiting the property in the early 1900s while he worked as a manager for the company. Russell renovated the property in 1910 in a Tudor and Stuart period style, with the help of the Arts and Crafts architect Charles Bateman (1863–1947). Russell recounted the experience of acquiring the Lygon Arms in his book The Story of an Old English Hostelry, published in 1914. In 1915, Russell moved out of the newly refurbished hotel to the village of Snowshill with the aim of separating his business and personal life. At the start of 2016 the new owners of the Lygon Arms, Ian Livingstone and Richard Livingstone, announced that the property would be going under extensive redevelopment.

They adopted the term, perhaps defensively, in response to a number of tribes who scorned people who refused to undergo circumcision. Country Njunga traditional lands encompassed some , running along and about 30 miles inland of the Southern coastal area of Western Australia. The coastal line ran from Young River east to Israelite Bay. One point of intertribal dispute between the Njunga and their Ngadjunmaia neighbours lay over the area between Point Malcolm and a place called 'Ka:pkidjakidj, somewhere around the northern end of Israelite Bay. Both claimed this as their tribal land. History The Njunga once, before contact with whites, formed part of the Wudjari people, but split off over the issue of whether or not to adopt the rite of circumcision, which was being forcefully advocated by the Ngadjunmaia. The Njunga were those Wudjari who decided to import circumcision, though they stopped short of adopting the ancillary measure of subincision. Over time, they Njunga came to consider themselves distinct from their Wudjari kin, and, when asked by ethnographers, both the Wudjari and Njunga insisted that they had become separate tribal realities. The Njunga eventually relocated to New Norcia where Bishop Rosendo Salvado had taken them. Salvado had taken out British citizenship in order to have the right to defend aboriginal people in courts, where they were often charged with killing sheep and other livestock. Castholic doctrine, as enunciated by St Thomas Aquinas, does not consider taking out of necessity from others their property as theft, particularly since shepherds drove away the kangaroo on which natives depended.

His highest rank was makushita 43. In 2017, he became the heaviest professional sumo wrestler ever at , surpassing the record previously held by Konishiki. He decided to retire in September 2018. Career He was born on April 26, 1983, in the small town of Zaigrayevo, Zaigrayevsky District, Buryatia in the Soviet Union. He had been extraordinarily large since childhood, and after seeing sumo on television for the first time at the age of eight he was inspired to become a sumo wrestler. In 1999 at the age of 16 he moved with his family to St. Petersburg so he could study sumo. There he was scouted by the 55th yokozuna Kitanoumi, joining Kitanoumi stable in March 2000. He was the first Russian to enter professional sumo. He made his debut alongside Ryūō, Hōchiyama and . He was given the shikona of Ōrora, a reference to the Aurora. Ōrora spent most of his career in the fourth-highest sandanme division, which he first reached in May 2002. He had nine tournaments ranked in the third-highest makushita division, which he first reached in January 2008, peaking at Makushita 43 East in November 2011. His last appearance in the division was in January 2014. He served as a tsukebito or personal attendant to Kitanoumi for fourteen years until his stablemaster's death in November 2015, upon which his stable was renamed Yamahibiki with the former maegashira Ganyū becoming his stablemaster. His career record was 376 wins against 382 losses, with 12 absences due to injury, over 111 tournaments. =Weight= Ōrora already weighed on his debut in March 2000, and in 2010 reached , surpassing Yamamotoyama to be the second-heaviest sumo wrestler recorded. He recalled on one occasion ordering 50 servings of yakiniku, plus six bowls of ramen noodles. After reaching in the January 2017 health check-up he tried changing his diet, eating only once a day and taking more exercise by walking around his heya. However, he did not check his weight on a scale until the next health check-up on 22 August 2017, and in the seven months since he had, in fact, increased his weight by another five kilograms to reach , surpassing former ōzeki Konishiki's set in 1996 to become the heaviest wrestler ever in professional sumo. Ōrora remarked that he had not been aiming for the record but at least would now have a place in history. He joked that a rice ball eaten as a snack must have put him over. In a Twitter post on April 6, 2018, Orora stated that his weight had increased to .https://twitter.com/Ichiro_SUMO/status/982182591750029312 However, his peak weight officially recorded by the Sumo Association was , just before his retirement. Retirement In September 2017 he was demoted to jonidan, a division in which he had not competed since 2003. In September 2018 he announced his retirement after winning his final match to give him a 1–6 record at the rank of jonidan 12. Speaking to reporters he paid tribute to his late stablemaster Kitanoumi, and said his most memorable match was his victory over a young Hakuhō in September 2001. After a retirement ceremony at his stable, he returned to Russia on October 7, 2018. He was planning to find a job in sports events. Based once again in his hometown in Siberia, he has a large social media following. He announced on his Instagram account in April 2020 that since retiring he had lost 100kg. Speaking to the Asahi Shimbun in June 2020, said he had now switched to five small meals a day, does not eat after 7pm, walks 6 kilometres a day and goes to a gym. He said that it was difficult to stay healthy while living in a sumo stable as \\"you are the only person that can take care of you. Nobody in your sumo stable cares about you.\\" While active he suffered from hypertension and fatigue, and would require an oxygen tank for taking short walks. Fighting style Kainowaka in September 2009 Ōrora had a huge weight advantage over nearly all his opponents — his advantage over the wrestler Ohara in January 2012 was the largest disparity ever in a professional sumo bout, though in this bout he was beaten by the smaller wrestler when stepping out of the ring during a throw attempt. On the twelfth day of the September 2001 tournament he won with the extremely rare technique of tsukaminage or lifting throw, which can only be achieved against opponents much lighter than oneself and had not been seen in a tournament since Tokitsuyama won with it in November 1957. He also enjoyed employing the rare kimarite of kimedashi, or arm-barring force-out, and was credited with this technique 41 times as of July 2017, by far the most among his contemporaries. His most common winning technique was a straightforward force out or yori-kiri. However, Ōrora was severely restricted by his lack of speed and agility, and only won around half his bouts. Many of his opponents simply circled him, waiting for him to tire. Career record *Note: Six official basho or tournaments are held each year—the Hatsu (First), Haru (Spring), Natsu (Summer), Nagoya, Aki (Autumn) and Kyushu.

DreamHack Austin hosted the DreamHack Astro Open Counter Strike: Global Offensive tournament, as well as tournaments for Super Smash Bros., Street Fighter V, and StarCraft II. Background DreamHack Austin was held in the Austin Convention Center. DreamHack Austin 2017 was held in the Austin Convention Center from April 28 to April 30, 2017. Asus Republic of Gamers had a booth at the convention and Asus, Intel and PC Gamer collaborated to set up gaming laptops and desktops, as well as a virtual reality station, in the \\"free-to-play\\" area. Austin was the first DreamHack event to be livestreamed directly on Twitter as part of a 2017 partnership between the two organizations. DreamHack Austin featured major tournaments for Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and StarCraft II. The Street Fighter V tournament held at this event was a Premier Event of the 2016 Capcom Pro Tour. Some of the smaller side-tournaments held at DreamHack Austin included Pokkén Tournament, For Honor, Guilty Gear Xrd, and NBA 2K. Tournaments =Counter Strike: Global Offensive= Dubbed \\"DreamHack Astro Open 2017\\", the Counter Strike: Global Offensive tournament held at DreamHack Austin featured eight teams and spanned the entire weekend. Six \\"Group Stage\\" matches were held on Friday, four playoffs on Saturday, and the semifinals and grand final were held on Sunday. Teams such as Cloud9, Immortals and Team Liquid played on their home turf during this event. G2 Esports had just overhauled their roster with former Team EnVyUs members earlier in the year, and sports news website FanSided noted that Gambit Esports had performed well during cs_summit this same month. The Immortals, led by Lincoln \\"fnx\\" Lau, defeated the team Heroic during the semifinals, taking 10 straight rounds in the first half of their second game. The two teams traded rounds at the start of the third game, but the Immortals eventually made a 16–13 win and went into the grand finals. The second match of the tournament was between Gambit and G2. Three overtime sets were needed before G2 was able to make a 25–22 win in their first game. G2 had a 10–3 lead at one point in their second game, but Gambit made a comeback and eventually won the second game 16–12, forcing a third game, which Gambit managed to win as well with a 16–14 lead. The Immortals and Gambit faced off in the grand finals, playing their first game on the map \\"Train\\". The Immortals rushed into a 3–0 lead early on, but eventually lost the first game 16–12 after Gambit won five rounds in a row. The second game was held on \\"Inferno\\" and Gambit gained a 9–1 lead in the first half. Though Gambit eventually reached a 14–7 lead in the second half, the Immortals managed to close the gap by winning another five rounds in a row: Gambit won the second round 16–12. At the end of the game, two Gambit members – Dosia and Mou – each had accumulated 46 kills, and four of the five team members had delivered over 74 damage per round (ADR), while only two Immortals members had over 70 ADR. Competitors raised complains about the noise at the event. All players were required to use Astro headphones during the tournament, but these failed to properly dampen outside noise during gameplay. G2 member Shox raised the issue during a post match interview. =StarCraft II= Alex \\"Neeb\\" Sunderhaft, DreamHack Austin 2017 StarCraft II champion. 80 players attended the DreamHack Austin StarCraft II tournament in order to qualify for the World Championship Series. The tournament was won by Alex \\"Neeb\\" Sunderhaft, who defeated Artur \\"Nerchio\\" Bloch 4–2 in the finals. Neeb was already a favorite before the tournament started, but seemed to have difficulty making it through the group stage, qualifying second from his group. Nerchio made it through the group stage in a much cleaner manner and entered the grand final with only three game losses. Neeb was overzealous and exposed his Mothership Core in their first match, which allowed Nerchio to take the first match. The rest of the set had a slow pace as Neeb took control of the map and dictated when each fight would take place; Neeb defeated Nerchio through stronger unit composition and a deliberate pace. =Street Fighter V= The fighting game tournaments at DreamHack Austin 2017 were organized by Alex Jebailey. The Street Fighter V tournament held at the event was the fourth Premier Event of the 2016 Capcom Pro Tour. Besides adding $15,000 USD to the tournament's prize pool, this meant that the winner of the tournament would be likely to qualify for the 2016 Capcom Cup. The tournament was won by Victor \\"Punk\\" Woodley, despite being knocked into the loser's bracket early on in the tournament. In contrast to his behavior at the 2017 NorCal Regionals, Punk spent much less time taunting and teabagging his opponents, Compete describing his actions as much more \\"polite\\". Punk matched off against Final Round 20 winner Kun Xian Ho in the finals and made quick work of him, staying outside of Xian's range and consistently punishing his mistakes. Multiple professional Street Fighter players switched to the character Ibuki during this tournament, including Fujimura \\"Yukadon\\" Atsushi, Goichi \\"GO1\\" Kishida, and Xian. However, under pressure of Punk's success, Xian switched back to his previous main character F.A.N.G. before the final round. Despite F.A.N.G.'s low placement on tier lists, Xian's last-minute switch resulted in a much closer final round. =Super Smash Bros.= The Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament held at DreamHack Austin 2017 featured high-level players such as Hungrybox, Mew2King, MKLeo, and ZeRo. Adam \\"Armada\\" Lindgren decided to skip the tournament because his GameCube controller was performing inadequately and he was not able to find a replacement with the proper malfunctions. In the loser's bracket, Mew2King proved fairly successful, defeating players such as William \\"Leffen\\" Hjelte, Justin \\"Plup\\" McGrath, and Joseph \\"Mang0\\" Marquez, but he eventually lost to Daniel \\"ChuDat\\" Rodriguez in the loser's finals. ChuDat went on to fight Hungrybox in the grand finals. The first few rounds were described as a \\"high-level spectacle\\" by ESPN, as ChuDat's Ice Climbers went up against Hungrybox' Jigglypuff. However, during the last round, Hungrybox saw he was slightly ahead of his opponent and decided to run out the clock, using Jigglypuff's superior air time to consistently evade ChuDat's attacks. ChuDat sacrificed a life in order to get his character back to full potential, but he still was not able to significantly damage his opponent. ChuDat refused to shake Hungrybox' hand after the latter was announced victorious.

She was a pioneer within nursing in Australia. A student of the Florence Nightingale School for Nurses, she was the founder of the Visiting Relief Society (for health care in the gold fields) in 1865, and a co-founder of the pioneer nursing education Home and Training School for Nurses in Sydney (1882).  Early life and education  Clarke was born in Tasmania, one of eight children of Charles McLachlan, a merchant in Hobart and a member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council, and his wife Isabella, née Dick. Charles McLachlan's work took him to Britain during Margaret's childhood, and she was educated in England, becoming proficient on the harp.  Adult life and philanthropy  Clarke married her first husband, Captain John Lunan Wilkie of the 12th Regiment of Foot on 22 April 1856, at St David's Cathedral, Hobart. They had three daughters, one still-born in Hobart in 1857, one born in London in 1859, who did not survive infancy, and the third still- born in Sydney in 1861. In 1861, the regiment was sent to Lambing Flat, the scene of a gold rush and anti-Chinese violence. Clarke found the poor living conditions of the 15,000 miners shocking. On 1 February 1862, her husband died of apoplexy after falling from his horse, and Clarke returned to England. There, she trained at the Nightingale School for Nurses set up by Florence Nightingale at St. Thomas' Hospital, London. She returned to Australia, and to Lambing Flat (renamed Young in 1863), by 1865. She had inherited about £3,000 on Wilkie's death, and \\"it was her favorite study to seek for all who were in trouble or poverty, and relieve their necessities to the utmost of her power.\\" In November 1865, after a season of famine there, she established a Visiting Relief Society in Young. The following year, on 9 August 1866 at Trinity Church, Melbourne, she married George O'Malley Clarke, a magistrate and gold commissioner at Young, Clarke also gave a great deal of support to the Church of England in the Young area. She donated £500 towards the total cost of £1,500 of building St. John's Church in Young as a memorial to her first husband, and also worked to raise additional funds, engage an architect, import materials, and she sewed the church needlework. She also helped to raise funds for a Church of England school and parsonage, and a public school, at Young, and for St Matthew's Church of England in the small village of Wombat. In 1882, Clarke and her husband moved to Sydney. There, she helped to establish the Home and Training School for Nurses for the Sick, and donated £150-£200 per year to the Sydney City Mission. The Home and Training School for Nurses, situated in Phillip Street, Sydney, as well as having more than twenty nurses available for paid employment, also provided nurses to \\"seek out and relieve, with food and proper attendance, the sick whose poverty would otherwise place such relief beyond their reach.\\" Clarke died at her home in Woollahra, Sydney, on 8 August 1887, of heart failure. She was buried at Waverley Cemetery, with the service conducted by the Rev. Henry Wallace Mort, rector of All Saints Anglican Church, Woollahra. She left bequests to the Sydney City Mission and the Church Society of the Anglican Diocese of Goulburn, among others.

Etymology The term 达曼人 (lit. Daman people) is an exonym from Tibetic languages, da means horse and man means soldier, daman means cavalryman. History In 1792, after the Sino- Gorkha war, hundreds of Gorkha soldiers were lost in the China-Nepal border and then resided there. The Daman people are allegedly the descendants of the Gorkha soldiers, and there have been the 6th or 7th generations since then.

Ivory Coast ranked 47th on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance. In 2011, three-quarters (76%) of the population had access to clean water, 59% to electricity, 15% to sanitation and just 2.6% access to Internet. In 2013, the services sector contributed more than half (56%) of GDP, compared to 22% for agriculture and 22% for industry. Within industry, manufacturing contributed 13% of GDP, one of the highest ratios in West Africa. Three products accounted for more than half of exports: cocoa beans (32% of exports), petroleum and other oils (12%) and natural rubber (7%). = National Development Plan = Ivory Coast recorded economic growth of 8.7% in 2013 after entering recession in 2011 at the height of the political crisis engendered by President Laurent Gbagbo's decision to contest the electoral result. With the political crisis now over, the government of President Alassane Ouattara has vowed to restore the country to its former leading role in Sub-Saharan Africa. The National Development Plan for 2012–2015 has two primary objectives: to achieve double-digit growth by 2014 and to turn Ivory Coast into an upper middle-income country by 2020. A second national development plan was under preparation in 2015 for 2016–2020. The budget for the National Development Plan to 2015 is broken down into five strategic areas: greater wealth creation and social equity (63.8%), provision of quality social services for vulnerable populations, particularly women and children (14.6%), good governance and the restoration of peace and security (9.6%), a healthy environment (9.4%) and the repositioning of Ivory Coast on the regional and international scenes (1.8%). Key targets of the National Development Plan requiring recourse to science and technology include: * rehabilitation of the railway linking Abidjan to Burkina Faso’s border, rehabilitation and extension of the ports of Abidjan and San Pédro, creation of a new airline company (infrastructure and transport); * increasing the productivity of yam, banana plantain and manioc by at least 15% (agriculture); * creation of two transformation units for iron and manganese and one for gold refining (mining); * construction of the Soubré dam, electrification of 200 rural communities each year (energy); * establishment and equipping of three technopoles to promote innovation, transformation of 50% of raw materials into value-added goods (industry and SMEs); * expansion of the country’s fibre optic network, introduction of an e-education programme, establishment of cybercentres in every municipality (post and ICTs); * construction and equipping of 25 000 classrooms, construction of four universities and a university village, rehabilitation of several existing universities (education); * rehabilitation of hospitals and clinics, free health care for children under the age of five, free childbirth care and free emergency care (health); * construction of latrines in rural areas, rehabilitation of sewage systems in Abidjan and Yamoussoukro (sanitation); * connection of 30 000 low- income families each year to subsidized piped water (drinking water); * rehabilitation of the lagoon and Cocody Bay in Abidjan and construction of a technopole to treat and recycle industrial and dangerous waste (environment).  Science policy  As of 2015, Ivory Coast did not have a dedicated policy for science, technology and innovation (STI). Related policies are implemented by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research. The main planning body is the Directorate General of Scientific Research and Technological Innovation and its technical directorate. For its part, the Higher Council for Scientific Research and Technological Development serves as a forum for consultation and dialogue with stakeholders and research partners. Research and innovation are promoted and funded by the National Agricultural Investment Programme (est. 2010), the Policy Support Programme for Scientific Research (est. 2007), the Interprofessional Fund for Agricultural Research and Advice (est. 2002), the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Research (yet to be established) and the Ivorian Fund for the Development of National Enterprises (est. 1999). According to the African Biosafety Network of Expertise, Ivory Coast did not have any biosafety laws or confined field trials in 2013.  Structures fostering technology transfer  The following structures foster innovation and technology transfer: the Department for the Promotion of Research and Technological Innovation, the Ivorian Organization for Intellectual Property and the Centre for the Demonstration and Promotion of Technologies. To this list should be added the Ivorian Society of Tropical Technology. Set up in 1979, this government centre promotes agro-industrial innovation and provides training in the preservation and transformation of crops (manioc, banana plantain, cashew nut, coconut, pineapple, etc.) into value-added goods such as soap and cocoa butter. Other key structures include the Pasteur Institute, Centre for Oceanological Research, National Centre for Agronomic Research, National Institute of Public Health, Centre for Ecological Research and the Centre for Economic and Social Research. The National School of Statistics and Economics was designated a centre of excellence in 2012 by the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). This label entitled it to two years of financial support from WAEMU.  Research and development  = Financial investment = According to the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Ivory Coast devoted about 0.13% of its GDP to GERD in 2013. Apart from low investment, other challenges include inadequate scientific equipment, the fragmentation of research organizations and a failure to exploit and protect research results. The share of the National Development Plan to 2015 devoted to scientific research remains modest. Within the section on greater wealth creation and social equity (63.8% of the total budget for the Plan), just 1.2% is allocated to scientific research. Twenty- four national research programmes group public and private research and training institutions around a common research theme. These programmes correspond to eight priority sectors for 2012–2015, namely: health, raw materials, agriculture, culture, environment, governance, mining and energy; and technology. = Human investment = In 2012, Ivory Coast counted 57 541 students at post-secondary diploma level, 23 008 first- and second-degree (bachelor's and master's) students and 269 PhD students. Enrollment in tertiary education suffered during the political crisis, halving from 9.03% of the 18-25-year cohort in 2009 to 4.46% in 2012. Recent data are unavailable but, in 2005, there were a total of 1,269 researchers in full-time equivalents, corresponding to 73 per million inhabitants. Some 16% of researchers were women, a lower proportion than the 30% average for Sub- Saharan Africa. = Scientific output = Scientific output is relatively modest in Ivory Coast, with scientists producing 10 articles per million inhabitants in international journals in 2014, compared to a continental average of 20 per million. The language barrier may explain this trend at least in part, since Thomson Reuters' database tends to favour English- language journals. Between 2005 and 2014, Ivory Coast's scientific output almost doubled from 110 to 208, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded), a trend also observed in other West African countries. The production of scientific articles from Ivory Coast peaked in 2012 before declining slightly in 2014, no doubt as a result of the political crisis in the country. Between 2008 and 2014, scientists published most in biological sciences (427 articles), followed by medical sciences (302) then geosciences (114), agriculture and chemistry (78 each). Ivory Coast is an exception in West Africa for the rate of international collaboration. Whereas more than eight out of ten articles had a foreign co-author in most countries in 2014, the rate in Ivory Coast was 73%. Between 2008 and 2014, Ivory Coast's main scientific partners were France (610 co-authored articles), the United States of America (183), Switzerland (162), the United Kingdom (109) and Burkina Faso (93). Ivory Coast is also the fifth-closest collaborator for Togo.  Regional science and technology policy  Ivory Coast is a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). In 2011, ECOWAS adopted a Policy on Science and Technology (ECOPOST). ECOPOST is an integral part of the subregion's development blueprint to 2020, entitled Vision 2020. Vision 2020 proposes a road map for improving governance, accelerating economic and monetary integration and fostering public–private partnerships. It endorses the planned harmonization of investment laws in West Africa and suggests pursuing ‘with vigour’ the creation of a regional investment promotion agency. Countries are urged to promote efficient, viable small and medium-sized enterprises and to expose traditional agriculture to modern technology, entrepreneurship and innovation, in order to improve productivity. ECOPOST provides a framework for member states wishing to improve – or elaborate for the first time – their own national policies and action plans for science, technology and innovation. Importantly, ECOPOST includes a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating the policy’s implementation, an aspect often overlooked. ECOPOST advocates the development of a science culture in all sectors of society, including through science popularization, the dissemination of research results in local and international journals, the commercialization of research results, greater technology transfer, intellectual property protection, stronger university–industry ties and the enhancement of traditional knowledge.  Regional research centres  Ivory Coast should be able to take advantage of a number of subregional centres established in recent years. = Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency = The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) established the ECOWAS Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ECREEE) in Praia, the capital of Cape Verde, in 2010. The centre has been established within the United Nations' Sustainable Energy for All programme. The mission of the centre is to create favourable framework conditions for renewable energy and energy efficiency markets in the 15 member states of ECOWAS. Since its founding, there has been growing external demand for its services. Two other centres in Sub-Saharan Africa will seek to replicate the ECREEE model. One will be established by UNIDO and the East African Community to serve Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. A second will serve the 15 Member States of the Southern Africa Development Community. Both centres should be fully operational by 2014. Other centres are being established within the same network in the Caribbean and Pacific. = West African Biosciences Network = From 2005 onwards, the New Partnership for Africa's Development set up four networks within the African Biosciences Initiative. The West African Biosciences Network has its hub at the Senegalese Institute for Agricultural Research in Dakar. The other networks are the Southern African Network for Biosciences, based at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria (South Africa), the Northern Africa Biosciences Network based at the National Research Centre in Cairo (Egypt) and the Biosciences Eastern and Central Africa Network based at the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi (Kenya). = African Institutes for Mathematical Sciences = There are five African Institutes for Mathematical Sciences. These are situated in Cameroon (est. 2013), Ghana (est. 2012), Senegal (est. 2013), South Africa (est. 2003) and Tanzania (est. 2014). The one in Senegal teaches in both English and French. Each institute provides academic programmes in basic and applied mathematics, including cosmology, finance and computing, as well as interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics. Each also provides community services. The first institute was the brainchild of South African cosmologist Neil Turok. It is planned to develop 15 centres of excellence across Africa by 2023 within the Next Einstein Initiative, a name inspired by the idea that the next Einstein could come from Africa. The project is supported by numerous governments in Africa and Europe, as well as by the Government of Canada. = West Africa Institute = The West Africa Institute was established in Praia (Cape Verde) in 2010 to provide the missing link between policy and research in the regional integration process. The institute is a service provider, conducting research for regional and national public institutions, the private sector, civil society and the media. The think tank also organizes political and scientific dialogues between policy-makers, regional institutions and members of civil society.  Global Health Security Agenda  The Ebola epidemic in 2014 highlighted the challenge of mobilizing funds, equipment and human resources to manage a rapidly evolving health crisis. In 2015, the United States of America decided to invest US$1 billion over the next five years in preventing, detecting and responding to future infectious disease outbreaks in 17 countries, within its Global Health Security Agenda. Ivory Coast is one of these 17 countries. The others are: (in Africa) Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Uganda; (in Asia): Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Viet Nam.

The bread may be produced in huge loafs amounting to 14 kg. It is a protected produce, under geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union. Prądnik bread was produced in villages located on the banks of the Prądnik River - in Prądnik Czerwony and Prądnik Biały, from the fourteenth-century. Formerly, the river's upper course gravitational potential energy was harvested for the use of watermills for milling flour. The oldest document to mention Prądnik bread originates from 1421, when the Bishop of Kraków, Albert gave his cook two domains (źreb) of land by the Prądnik River and tasks him with baking bread for the bishopric. By royal prerogative, on May 26, 1496, King John I Albert gave the bakers on the River Prądnik (among others) the right to sell bread in Kraków once a week, during the market occurring on Tuesdays. Bakers outside of Kraków had limitations on their sale and production of bread, having only received full commercial rights in 1785.

Originally called Holthanger, it was renamed Southern Court and subsequently Cherry Hill. The property was commissioned by Katherine Hannah Newton, a wealthy single woman, whose family company, Newton, Chambers & Co., was one of England's largest industrial companies. Unlike the surrounding Walter George Tarrant houses being built on the Wentworth Estate at the time, Modern Movement houses such as Holthanger were expensive \\"one-off\\" solutions designed to satisfy the needs of private individuals and included provision for motor cars, sophisticated kitchen and heating and electrical equipment and for accommodating domestic staff. Oliver Hill design The building is a two-storey house built of brick and rendered white with a flat roof and a blue tinted cylindrical water tower as a roof feature. The plan is a shallow curve which took into account the Scots pines trees to the north of the site. A projecting semi circular fully glazed staircase tower rises to the full height of the building enclosing a grand circular staircase. The central plan figure extends at each end with ancillary accommodation in two wings. To maximise the sunlight and the views, all of the principal rooms were located on the south elevation. The ground floor living room, semi circular sun room and kitchen space are all recessed at ground floor forming a loggia to either side, and accessed from the dining room with the first floor accommodation above supported on slender circular concrete ‘piloti’. The house is set back from the road with a winding drive and dense landscaping that keeps it hidden from public view. Marion Dorn, the textiles designer, designed the original curtains for the property. The property was featured in an American exhibition titled ‘Modern British Architecture’ at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 1937.https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_2086_300061913.pdf Grade II listed by English Heritage in August 1986, it is the only remaining listed building on the Wentworth Estate following the illegal demolition of Greenside in 2003.  Alterations  In 1968 permission was granted for the garage to be converted to a living room and for a roof enclosure to terrace to form a garage. In 1972, a horse stable and tack room were permitted. Between 2009 and 2015, permission was granted for a detached garage block, for the wings of the main house to be demolished, rebuilt and extended incorporating basement accommodation and for landscaping works to be carried out. The original form and central plan arrangement of the principal rooms of the house remains largely intact together with the original curved staircase, slender steel framed curved stair window and curved timber handrail detail to the top of the central curved baluster wall.

Overview The Tennessee Transgender Political Coalition was founded on May 30, 2003, in Nashville, Tennessee by Marisa Richmond and a group of concerned citizens. It is a trans organized and trans led organization. It is inclusive of intersectional identities and identities both binary and nonbinary. For over a decade, the TTPC has lobbied both for and against legislation affecting the transgender community of Tennessee. The organization has lobbied against a 2006 referendum to amend the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage, the Don't Say Gay bill sponsored in 2011 by Sen. Stacey Campfield and Rep. Bill Dunn,Pink News: Steve Brewer, \\"Tennessee proposes bill to ban gay awareness in schools\\", March 1, 2011, accessed July 4, 2011Pink News: Jessica Geen, \\"Anger over Tennessee's 'don’t say gay' bill\\", 28 April 2011, accessed July 4, 2011 and other public issues. It endorsed Nashville mayor Karl Dean for re-election in 2011 and Megan Barry in 2017. Active members engage in direct lobbying efforts, public education, and grassroots community organizing, as well as the community support expected from any trans organization. A member has run for office, and currently serves on a metro human rights commission. TTPC has lobbied for and been instrumental in several high-profile moments for LGBT equality: the Federal Hate Crimes Law (October 2009) passed inclusively for LGBT individuals—four of the votes in favor of the law were from representatives in Tennessee; the CANDO [Contract Accountability Non- Discrimination Ordinance] ordinance in Nashville; and the changing of policy in places such as FedEx and Vanderbilt University to include non- discrimination of employees based on gender identity or expression.Ballotpedia: accessed August 23, 2017 The organization was an outspoken opponent of a 2016 proposed law that would have required students in public schools and universities to use the restroom that corresponded with their assigned sex. Along with the Human Rights Campaign, the ACLU, and the Tennessee Equality Project, the TTPC was \\"highly critical\\" of the legislation, according to The Tennessean.The Tennessean: \\"Transgender Bathroom Bill Dead for a Year\\", 18 April 2016, accessed August 23, 2017 Ryan Wilson, a regional field organizer for the Human Rights Campaign, noted that the work of the TTPC was particularly influential because the group succeeded at \\"uniting state and national resources\\" to form \\"a powerful barrier against a number of bills which have died now that legislative session has ended.HRC: \\"Spending a Week in the Tennessee State Capitol with Local Advocates\\", 22 April 2016, accessed August 23, 2017 In August 2015, TTPC announced a community meeting in Johnson City, TN. Following the meeting, a member of TTPC in partnership with local stakeholders, simultaneously worked to build a local transgender support group, organize the first inclusive public TDoR (Transgender Day of Remembrance) and fight an anti-child transgender bathroom bill sponsored by a legislator elected from the local area. All of these efforts were successful. Roe withdrew his sponsorship of the bill that year, though someone else in another part of the state picked it up. TTPC also assisted organizing hundreds of protestors showing up to attend a set of county commission meetings intending to vote on anti-marriage statements. Johnson City has since developed an actively supportive local culture for transgender people. TTPC successfully fought bathroom bills and other assorted anti-trans and anti-LGBT bills in Tennessee in 2016 and 2017,Johnson City Press: accessed August 13, 2017 and actively plans to continue doing so into the future until it is no longer necessary.

Infants cry as a form of basic instinctive communication. Essentially, newborns are transitioning from life in the womb to the external environment. Up to 27% of parents describe problems with infant crying in the first four months. Up to 38% identify a problem with their infant crying within the first year. Parents can be concerned about the amount of time that their infant cries, how the infant can be consoled, and disrupted sleeping patterns. Colic is used as a synonym for excessive crying of infants, even though colic may not be the cause of excessive crying. Physiology Crying may elicit the Valsalva reflex. This reflex negatively impacts sucking pressures and results in poor feeding. The cortisol levels will rise along with blood pressure. Increased blood pressure will have an effect on cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood flow velocity and intracranial pressure. Increased pressures and velocity can lead to intracranial hemmorrhage. Prolonged exhalation may also cause some adverse effects. Obstructed venous return and quick inspiratory gasp can occur. Foramen ovale shunting can occur. Adults can often determine whether an infant's cries signify anger or pain. Most parents also have a better ability to distinguish their own infant's cries than those of a different child. Babies mimic their parents' pitch contour. French infants wail on a rising note while German infants favor a falling melody. Overstimulation may be a contributing factor to infant crying and that periods of active crying might serve the purpose of discharging overstimulation and helping the baby’s nervous system regain homeostasis.Brazelton, T.B. (1985). \\"Application of cry research to clinical perspectives.\\" In B.M. Lester and C.F.Z. Boukydis (Eds.), Infant Crying: Theoretical and Research Perspectives. New York: Plenum Press.Brazelton, T.B. (1992). Touchpoints. New York: Perseus. Misconceptions Misconceptions regarding the purpose of crying in the infant are common among caregivers and medical personnel. These are usually determined by cultural mores and not by evidence-based explanations. The crying of an infant is regarded by some to be normal and good.\\"It's OK to be a cry baby at bedtime, study says.\\" Age [Melbourne, Australia], 26 May 2016, p. 11. Opposing Viewpoints in Context, link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A453306793/OVIC?u=pitt92539&xid;=ffe1df14. Accessed 23 Aug. 2017. The belief that infants have a need to cry to expand or exercise their lungs is not supported by research. This is because a healthy newborn infant lung's are able to contain a sufficient amount of air plus a reserve. Birth trauma is related to the amount of crying. Mothers who had experienced obstetrical interventions or who were made to feel powerless during birth had babies who cried more than other babies.Kitzinger, S. (1989). The Crying Baby. New York: Viking. Babies who had experienced birth complications had longer crying spells at three months of age and awakened more frequently at night crying.de Weerth, C. & Buitelaar, J.K. (2007). \\"Childbirth complications affect young infants' behavior.\\" European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 16 (6): 379–388.Keller, H., Lohaus, A., Volker, S., Cappenberg, M. & Chasiotis, A. (1998). \\"Relationships between infant crying, birth complications, and maternal variables.\\" Child: Care, Health and Development, 24 (5): 377–394. When infants cry for no obvious reason after all other causes (such as hunger or pain) are ruled out, the crying may signify a beneficial stress-release mechanism, although not all sources agree with this. The \\"crying-in-arms\\" approach is a way to comfort these infants.Solter, A. (1995). \\"Why do babies cry?\\" Pre- and Perinatal Psychology Journal, 10 (1), 21–43.Solter, A. (1998). Tears and Tantrums: What to Do When Babies and Children Cry. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press.Solter, A. (2004). Crying for comfort: distressed babies need to be held.\\" Mothering, Issue 122 January/February, 24–29. Another way of comforting and calming the baby is to mimic the familiarity of the mother’s womb. Consistency and promptness of maternal response is associated with a decline in frequency and duration of crying by the end of the first year, and individual differences in crying reflect the history of maternal responsiveness rather than constitutional differences in infant irritability. There is online training to address the educational needs of the parents of the infant and caregivers in the understanding and handling of infant crying. Causes Though colic is often assumed to be the cause of excessive crying in infants, there are others: *Trauma *Abuse *Corneal abrasions *Foreign body in the eye *Fractured bone *Central nervous system abnormality **Chiari type I malformation **Infantile migraine **Subdural hematoma *Constipation *Cow’s milk protein intolerance *Gastroesophageal reflux *Lactose intolerance *Rectal fissure *Infection **Meningitis **Otitis media **Urinary tract infection **Viral illness *Hair tourniquet syndrome =Colic= The term 'colic' was defined in 1954 as: \\" crying for more than three hours per day, for more than three days per week, and for more than three weeks in an infant that is well-fed and otherwise healthy.\\" Colic and excessive crying by infants is synonymous to some clinicians. Colic is attributed to gastrointestinal discomfort like intestinal cramping. Clinicians often admit that colic can't be treated or that alternative treatments are ineffective. The protocol followed by clinicians to treat colic is described as \\"treating the parents\\" with reassurance. Maternal responses Crying in infants is associated with high stress levels and depression in mothers. Excessive crying has also been linked to maternal \\"physical aggression\\" and \\"angry speaking\\". The burden of care of the mother, that is, mothers without assistance in caring for the infant, are more prone to physical aggression and angry speaking. During evaluations of maternal depression responses to infant crying, sleeping problems are closely associated with excessive crying and may confound the conclusions of such research. Also, it is not always clear that when sleeping problems are associated with infant crying, whether the sleeping problems are descriptive of the mother or the infant or both. Maternal stress is associated with excessive crying. Effects on young children One definition used to study excessive crying in infants (colic) is crying for three or more hours per 24 hours. Excessive infant crying has been associated with a twofold increased risk of the overall problem behavior, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6. Excessive infant crying doubles the risk of behavioral, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6, as reported by their mother. Excessive crying is not the only factor in later childhood difficulties. Behavioral problems in childhood include the so-called regulatory problems, such as excessive crying, sleeping, and feeding problems, which occur in 20% of infants in multiproblem families. Excessive crying, whining and sleeping problems at 4–6 months are associated with decreased social development at 12 months. Several factors may contribute to, and partly explain, an association between excessive infant crying and later behavioral and emotional problems. During early infancy, the quality of the mother–child dyad can be considered to be a crucial vehicle for child’s healthy mental development. Both early maternal and early paternal reciprocity in infancy are predictive of social competence and lower aggression in preschoolers. Compared to other infants, excessive crying infants had a slightly lower birth weight and a slightly younger gestational age. Excessive crying infants more often had a single, lower educated mother, originating from a non-industrialized country, who reported more depression, a higher burden of infant care, and more aggressive behavior and had an authoritarian parenting style. Excessive crying was associated with a higher risk for hyperactivity/inattention problems, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, peer relationship problems, and overall problem behavior at the age of 5–6, as well as a higher risk for decreased pro-social behavior as reported by the mother. Excessive crying was also associated with mood problems as well as generalized anxiety problems at the age of 5–6. Abuse =Normal crying= The physical abuse of infants is related to crying. Crying may be related to the abusive head trauma in infants. This is the most common cause of child abuse death. Fathers are often the ones who shake the infant. Shaking may occur many times. This shaking can cause serious injuries almost 50% of the time. Some caregivers are unaware that shaking the baby can seriously harm or kill the infant. This type of abuse is being addressed by efforts to educate parents and caregivers with educational flyers and videos. Prevention and treatment Infant crying is most excessive in the first several months of life, but lessens as the infant develops. A baby can sometimes be calmed by rocking gently, offering a pacifier, singing or talking softly, taking a walk with a stroller, or going for a drive in the car. If a baby won’t stop crying, it can be sick and seen by a doctor. Frustration and stress can be overwhelming for those with an infant that cries for hours on end. If caregivers feel as if they may lose control there are preventative measures that can be taken. The caregiver may benefit by calling a friend, relative, neighbor, or parent helpline for support. Another suggestion is to put the baby in a safe place and walk away. The baby can be checked every 5 to 10 minutes. Babies may be in danger if a person who is easily irritated, has a temper or a history of violence cares for or watches the baby.https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childmaltreatment/abusive-head- trauma.html When \\"normal\\" causes of excessive crying are ruled out, some caregivers adopt alternative and complementary treatments for excessive crying. Those practices include: * Eliminating milk products, eggs, wheat, and nuts from the diet of breastfeeding mothers * Feeding infants fiber-enriched formula; not proven to be of benefit for most infants * Counseling parents about specific colic-management techniques; not proven to be effective for most infants * Infant massage; not proven to be effective or recommended Those who realize that an infant can be in a situation where abuse is a possibility, support can be offered to give a parent or caregiver a break when needed. Education and understanding can let the parent know that dealing with a baby that is crying excessively can be very frustrating—especially when they are tired or stressed, however crying is a normal behavior in infants and will subside at some point. Parents can be encouraged to take a calming break if needed while the baby is safe in the crib. Others can be sensitive and supportive in situations when parents are trying to calm a baby that is crying continuously.

Early years André Lebon was born on 26 August 1858 in Dieppe, Seine-Inférieure. His father was Charles Lebon, founder of the Société du Gaz Lebon. After completing his secondary education André Lebon attended the Faculty of Law in Paris, where he obtained his license. He wrote many books on history and constitutional law. He was made a knight of the Legion of Honour in 1887, and later was promoted to Grand Officer. Until 1890, under the pseudonym André Daniel, he published an annual review of the history of the previous year entitled L'Année politique. He was appointed a professor at the École libre des sciences politiques in 1884. In 1890 he was secretary of the French delegation to the International Workers' Conference in Berlin. Political career Lebon was chief of staff to the President of the Senate, Philippe Le Royer, from 1882 to 1893. Lebon ran for election on 22 September 1889 as deputy for Parthenay, Deux-Sèvres, on the Progressive Republican platform. He was defeated by the monarchist candidate, Paul Taudière. He ran again for the same seat on the same platform on 20 August 1893 and defeated Taudière on the first ballot. He wanted the republic to be open to all, and although he respected the freedom of the church he wanted it to have no influence on legislation. Lebon was secretary of the Chamber of Deputies until 1895. He was responsible for the Labor and Budget committees for the 1897 financial year. Lebon was Minister of Commerce, Industry and Posts & Telegraphs from 26 January 1895 to 28 October 1895 in the cabinet of Alexandre Ribot. He resigned with his colleagues on 28 October 1895. He was Minister of Colonies from 26 April 1896 to 26 June 1898 in the cabinet of Jules Méline. Georges Bonnefous, who later would also become Minister of Commerce and Industry, served as his deputy chief of staff. Lebon was the first Minister of the Colonies to have made an official visit to one of them, when he visited Senegal while in office. He was criticized for having taken unnecessarily harsh measures against Alfred Dreyfus during his imprisonment on Devil's Island. In the general elections of 8 May 1898 Lebon ran again for the Parthenay district but was defeated in the first round by the Marquis de Maussabré. He also failed to be elected on 27 April 1902. Later years (1898–1938) Lebon then devoted himself to business, and served as censor of Crédit Foncier de France, Chairman of the Board of Crédit Foncier d'Algerie, of the shipping line Messageries Maritimes and of several financial and industrial companies. He became first president of the Comité central des armateurs de France (CCAF: Central Committee of French Shipowners). He engaged Paul de Rousiers in 1903 to administer the committee. De Rousiers was secretary-general and vice-president-delegate of the committee. André Lebon died on 17 February 1938 in Paris.

Life She was born Marta Maria Emilie Schmitz in Cologne, Germany, to attorney Emil Schmitz and Elise (Esser) Schmitz. She later described her childhood as oppressive. She studied art privately in Düsseldorf with Willy Spatz because women were not then allowed to enroll in German art schools. She also studied in the women's wing of the Munich Art Association and later with the artist Cuno Amiet in Switzerland. When she returned to Cologne, she moved into a residential community with the artists Emmy Worringer and Olga Oppenheimer. In 1907, she married Emmy's brother, the art historian Wilhelm Worringer; they had three daughters whose care fell largely to Marta. Marta and Wilhelm moved several times as Wilhelm shifted from one university job to another. They lived successively in Bern (1909–1914), Bonn (1914–1927), Königsberg (1928–44), Berlin (1944–46), and Halle on the Saale (1946-50). In 1950, they moved to Munich, where they both died in 1965. Artwork In the early 1900s, Worringer became associated with the Cologne Secession and was a member of the avant-garde Gereonsklub. In 1910, she exhibited at the Bern Art Museum, and the following year she exhibited at the Paris Salon. After World War I, she turned towards the movement known as Das Junge Rheinland (The Young Rhinelanders), which rejected academicism in art. During the 1920s, she took part in exhibitions throughout Germany, and from the late 1920s until 1941, she showed her work regularly at the Königsberg Art Association. During the years of the Weimar Republic, she was so successful that she was able to financially support her family. Worringer worked primarily in the mediums of drawing and printmaking and became known for her austere drawings of anonymous women suffering from grief and fear. Her work was frequently compared to that of Käthe Kollwitz for their shared interest in depicting anguished women, but her style is considerably more stylized than Kollwitz's. She also sold some embroidery designs and illustrated some books, including an edition of Heinrich Kleist's story The Marquise of O. In her late 40s, she took up painting large oils, but hardly any of these survived. Worringer had to leave behind almost her entire oeuvre in the wartime move from Königsberg to Berlin in 1944. Some 175 of her works are known to have survived, many from the postwar period. In 1993-94, a retrospective of her work was held in Bonn at the August-Macke-Haus.

Imperial Letter), is the letter to the German Federal princes signed by North German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck on 27 November 1870 and Bavarian King Ludwig II (born 1845, reign 1864–1886) on 30 November 1870. Ludwig's uncle, Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, the later Prince Regent (1886–1912), on 3 December 1870 personally handed over the Imperial Letter to the Prussian king. Ludwig II gave the impetus to the emperor's proclamation of William I in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles with this letter, which the Prussian King William I proposed to the imperial dignity of the newly founded German Empire, where, during the Siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War, representatives of the free cities congregated on 18 January 1871. An excerpt of the Imperial LetterHaus der Bayerischen Geschichte: Gründung des Deutschen Kaiserreichs 1871 (PDF), abgerufen am 20. September 2013.:  Instigation of the letter  Otto von Bismarck, 1873 Ludwig II, 1870 Even though the historical circumstance which led to this letter have now largely been clarified, their interpretation is still controversial. This document, which is important for the founding of the German Empire, could well be regarded as the result of a state of doubtful behaviour, and thus perhaps even a form of corruption. = William's hesitation = William I took the new office of German Emperor only hesitantly, since he saw himself as the Prussian King. On the one hand, the southern German princes were not necessarily willing to accept Wilhelm's desire to call himself \\"Emperor of Germany\\", since they did not want to recognise a new sovereign. Finally, it was both William's and Bismarck's concerns to make the act of conferring and establishing the new dignity appear as one of the German princes and not the parliaments.Siehe dazu Otto Pflanze, Bismarck der Reichsgründer, C.H. Beck, München 1997, , S. 503; Heinrich August Winkler, Der lange Weg nach Westen, Bd. I, C.H. Beck, München 2002, , S. 210. It was still clear that 22 years previously in 1848, William's brother and predecessor, Frederick William IV, had rejected the emperor's deputation, which he had ordered the emperor's crown for a Lesser German Empire on the order of the Frankfurt National Assembly with the \\"free consent of the crowned heads, the princes and the free cities of Germany\\", since he was not born emperor. Bismarck, therefore, could only gain William's approval if the German princes and free cities asked him to accept the imperial crown., \\"the old, legitimate crown of the German nation, which had been laid down since 1806\\", as William described it elsewhere. This could only be done by the Bavarian King, since, according to the King of Prussia, he was regarded as the highest ranking of the princes of the small German nation. = Ludwig's opposition to Prussia = Ludwig II, who had been in office since 1864, was, however, a supporter of the Greater German solution, a German agreement including Austria, and thus also under the leadership of the Austria Emperor, and above all under the full protection of Bavarian sovereignty. He had not wounded the defeat of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, in which Bavaria, together with Saxony, Baden, Württemberg, Hanover, Hesse-Darmstadt, Electoral Hesse and Nassau, had stood as an ally to Austria. Bavaria had to pay Prussia 30 million guilders as compensation and subordinate its army to Prussia's command in the event of war.Franz Herre, Bayerns Märchenkönig Ludwig II., 6. Aufl., Heyne, München 2001, , S. 168–169. Under this command, with the enthusiastic consent of the population, 55,000 Bavarian soldiers, led by Prussian Prince Frederick William, were drawn into the war against France in 1870. Ludwig had refused to take the lead. He was also absent from the victory celebrations at Versailles and had rejected the request of his own government and on the orders of Bismarck, to make the Prussian King a German Emperor. His government, however, had already announced its acceptance to the German Empire without his consent,Franz Herre, Bayerns Märchenkönig Ludwig II., 6. Aufl., Heyne, München 2001, , S. 263–265. while Ludwig still complained about France's loss in the war. = Ludwig's notorious financial problems = From the outset, Ludwig was less interested in governmental affairs than in a particular representative depiction of his kingship in culture and architecture. This had a tradition in his family, his great-grandfather Maximilian I and grandfather Ludwig I had already used large parts of the state budget to the representative development of Munich as residence, but also to the promotion of art, education and science. Ludwig's locks burdened his private finances to the utmost. Prince Eulenberg-Hertefeld, secretary of the Prussian ambassador in Munich, described how the king had shattered state finances, and privately tried to get money from all sides, like a loan of twenty million florins from the prince of Thurn and Taxis. He had also begged the Austrian Emperor, the kings of Belgium and Sweden to ask the (Turkish) Sultan and the Shah of Persia for money.  Agreements of the Imperial Letter  = Telegram from Count Werthern = The tense financial situation, especially of his private fortune, was known to Bismarck and his own Bavarian ministers to induce Ludwig to make a decision, the Prussian ambassador, Count Werthern, on 19 November 1870, to Bismarck in the following words:Franz Herre, Bayerns Märchenkönig Ludwig II., 6. Aufl., München 2001, Heyne, , S. 268. As early as 20 November 1870, Bismarck telegraphed to the head of the Federal Chancellery in Berlin, Delbrück: \\"I hope to come to a conclusion with Bavaria. If it does so, it seems unquestionable that the question of the Emperor is to be brought from there\\".Otto von Bismarck, Werke in Auswahl, Bd. IV, Die Reichsgründung, Zweiter Teil: 1866–1871, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2001, , S. 575, Nr. 325. = Unity with Bavaria and King Ludwig = On 23 November 1870, Bismarck had reached an agreement with the representative of the Bavarian Government on their acceptance to the German Empire. Bismarck made major concessions to Bavaria (its own post and telecommunication systems, its own railways and its own army during peace time). He returned from the negotiations that \\"Now the Bavarian agreement has been finished and signed. German unity has been made and the emperor also\\".Otto von Bismarck, Werke in Auswahl, Bd. IV, Die Reichsgründung, Zweiter Teil: 1866–1871, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2001, , S. 576, Nr. 327. His employees signed the agreement with two empty bottles of champagne next to it. Oberst-Stallmeister Count Holnstein, Ludwig's confidant and personal communicator, arrived in Versailles two days later on 25 November 1870, where he was immediately received by Bismarck, without first communicating with the Bavarian negotiation delegation.Franz Herre, Bayerns Märchenkönig Ludwig II., 6. Aufl., Heyne, München 2001, , S. 268 f. Nothing is known about the course of the conversation, only the result of an agreement between the parties. On 26 November 1870, Bismarck announced this, albeit in a somewhat alienated form, to his co-workers, when, in a confidential memorandum, which he had sent to the head of the Staatskanzlei Delbrück on contract negotiations with the Bavarian government representatives on 23 November 1870, notes that \\"Following my letter today, I still keep in confidence that I have also discussed the imperial question with the Bavarian Ministers and have stated their willingness to initiate the same by stimulating Bavaria. According to their suggestions, I suppose that a letter from His Majesty the King of Bavaria to His Majesty the King in which the motion is made and is already underway\\".Otto von Bismarck, Werke in Auswahl, Bd. IV, Die Reichsgründung, Zweiter Teil: 1866–1871, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2001, , S. 583, Nr. 331. In fact, he had only recently agreed with Ludwig's representative about his demands and on 27 November 1870, he formulate the supposedly awaited letter, the later imperial letter, with caution. He had refrained from his original demand that Ludwig should come to Versailles in person. He gave the draft of the emperor's letter, together with a personal letter to Ludwig, which he began with exuberant thanksgiving. \\"Most Gracious, Most Highly King! For the gracious opening which Count Holnstein had made to Your Majesty, I would like to congratulate you on the most honourable expression of my thanks.\\" He then read the imperial letter.Otto von Bismarck, Werke in Auswahl, Bd. IV, Die Reichsgründung, Zweiter Teil: Die Reichsgründung, Zweiter Teil: 1866–1871, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2001, , S. 584, Nr. 333; vgl. Dokument auf Deutsche Geschichte in Dokumenten und Bildern (DGDB). Together with the Bavarian state ministers, who had represented Bavaria at the conclusion of the Bavarian acceptance treaty, Holnstein returned to Munich on the train and brought them to Bismarck's draft.Franz Herre, Bayerns Märchenkönig Ludwig II., 6. Aufl., Heyne, München 2001, , S. 274. On 30 November 1870, Holnstein arrived at the Hohenschwangau Castle, where Ludwig was staying and was received by the King when he was informed that he had to return to Versailles at 6 pm. He then told the King that he would go back to Versailles, either with or without result, but it was to be expected that the troops in front of Paris would exclaim William I as Emperor.Franz Herre, Bayerns Märchenkönig Ludwig II., 6. Aufl., Heyne, München 2001, , S. 270 f. With minor modifications, Ludwig wrote up Bismarck's draft and handed it to Holstein, who brought him to Munich for sealing. In an accompanying letter, Ludwig asked his secretary of the Cabinet to review the letter and, if a different letter seemed to be more appropriate to him, \\"the matter is being crushed, and I authorise you to tear the letter to the King of Prussia\\". The Secretary of the Cabinet, on the other hand, sealed the letter on 1 December, and Holnstein returned to Versailles the following day, where he received the letter from Ludwig's uncle, Prince Luitpold of Bavaria (1886–1912) who took over the role of Prince Regent after Ludwig was incapacitated. On 3 December 1870, Bismarck jubilated in a telegram to Count Werthern, the Prussian ambassador in Munich:Otto von Bismarck, Werke in Auswahl, Bd. IV, Die Reichsgründung, Zweiter Teil: 1866–1871, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2001, , S. 592, Nr. 339. = Count of Holnstein = Count Maximilian von Holnstein Count Maximilian von Holnstein (born 19 October 1835) knew Ludwig from his childhood. He was pardoned in 1866 by Ludwig from a fortress, which he had served for the sake of a reverend, and appointed him as the Royal Bavarian Oberstallmeister. He came from the House of Wittelsbach and held the royal domination of Schwarzenfeld, Rauberweiherhaus, Thanstein and Pillmersried in the Upper Palatinate. He enjoyed Ludwig's fullest confidence, which he lost only three years before his death because of his resistance to the King wasting money. He had acted as a guardian of Ludwig's incarceration. After Ludwig died, he remained as Oberststallmeister to Prince Regent Luitpold until 1892, and then retired to his castle in Schwarzfeld, where he died in 1895. Holnstein was also economically successful and belong to the co-founders of the Bayerische Vereinsbank. He played a central role in the settlement of the agreements with Bismarck. The details of the processing of payments made were fixed with him and he received 10% of the money, which headed back to Ludwig for his services.Otto Pflanze, Bismarck der Reichsgründer, C.H. Beck, München 1997, , S. 503; Herre, S. 269; Lothar Gall, Bismarck, Ullstein, Berlin 1997, , S. 518. Bismarck acknowledged his merits for German unification. \\"The Count of Holnstein has made a considerable contribution to the formal conclusion of our national agreement by eliminating the external obstacles of the German National Assembly by making two trips in a week without sleep and by the clever execution of his commission in Hohenschwangau.\\" Bismarck recommended to Count Werthern, the Prussian ambassador in Munich, on 24 December 1870, in connection with the ratification of the Bavarian acceptance treaties by the Bavarian parliament, which appeared to be uncertain, to discuss the position of the King on this question \\"also with Count Holnstein, who is best informed of the King's intentions and views.\\"Otto von Bismarck, Werke in Auswahl, Bd. IV, Die Reichsgründung, Zweiter Teil: 1866–1871, Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2001, , S. 612, Dokument N° 350. Holnstein's influence on Ludwig must have been striking. In 1882, Prince Eulenberg-Hertefeld reported the remark that \\"Holnstein must know some strange thing about the King and use it as weapon – the King no longer loves him, and he obeys him.\\"Brief von Prinz Eulenberg an Herbert von Bismarck vom 26. August 1882, in: Klaus von See (Hg.), Philip Fürst Eulenberg-Hertefeld, Das Ende König Ludwigs II., S. 135.  Settlement of payments to Ludwig  The information on the amount of payments made by Prussia to Ludwig fluctuated. This also pointed out that the German Empire in 1876 unified the currency and in Prussia converted Guilders into Goldmarks. Overall, Ludwig appeared to have received more than six million gold marks. In addition to a first large advance payment,Lothar Gall, Bismarck, Ullstein, Berlin 1997, , S. 518. the guarantee was to be given to him later, only after the first year's payments.Franz Herre, Bayerns Märchenkönig Ludwig II., 6. Aufl., Heyne, München 2001, , S. 269. The current payments began in 1873, initially 300,000 gold marks, which should have increased by the end of 1885. In 1884, Ludwig also received a special payment of more than one million gold marks.Franz Herre, Bayerns Märchenkönig Ludwig II., 6. Aufl., Heyne, München 2001, , S. 269; Otto Pflanze, Bismarck der Reichsgründer, C.H. Beck, München 1997, , S. 503; vgl. auch Heinrich August Winkler, Der lange Weg nach Westen, Bd. I, C.H. Beck, München 2002, , S. 210. The payments were handled secretly by Swiss banks and flowed into Ludwig's private assets. Since neither Emperor William nor Parliament could know of the agreement, Bismarck deducted the amounts of Welfs funds confiscated after the Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 which corresponded to the King's House of Hanover, estimated at 42 million guilders, identical of which to the English and Hanoverian throne. The property was considered to be confiscated until England would recognise the annexation of Hanover by Prussia. During this time, the revenues of Prussia flowed. Bismarck regarded the Welfs' funds as being outside of parliamentary control and used his income as a slush fund. It was not until 1892 that Emperor William II ordered the proceeds of the Welfs' funds to be given to the head of the former head of the Royal House of Hanover. Only after Ludwig's death and Bismarck's resignation as Chancellor in 1890 were the payments announced. Bismarck declared it a loan granted to the King of Bavaria, of which he had never accepted that it was to be repaid.Erika Brunner, Der tragische König, Berlin, 3.

Different assessments of Ludwig's behaviour  Since the payments and their circumstances had become known, it was disputed whether a bribery had been sent to the Imperial Letter and thus to a symbolically important act with regard to the founding of the Empire, whether it was a dossier to a swaying sovereign, or whether the payments were the work of bribes.Otto Pflanze, Bismarck der Reichsgründer, C.H. Beck, München 1997, , S. 503. Ludwig's behaviour was defended by the fact that it would correspond to political habits, to negotiate with the task of sovereignty or its restriction also over money payments, how often payments in the form of appanages or other donations to sovereigns were also agreed. Ludwig had certainly been seduced by his advisers.Franz Herre, Bayerns Märchenkönig Ludwig II., 6. Aufl., Heyne, München 2001, , S. 272; Pflanze, S. 503 Fn 22. Finally, a few years earlier, Prussia had to pay 30 million guilders as reparations. Ludwig's admirers also pointed out that their King would have been able to change his mind on money at all.Brunner, S. 274. On the other hand, the Bavarian government had already declared itself ready to join the German Empire at the time of the telegram sent by Count Werthern and could not have succeeded in carrying out its repayment of reparations.Franz Herre, Bayerns Märchenkönig Ludwig II., 6. Aufl., Heyne, München 2001, , S. 261 f. Moreover, it was clear to everyone that the private assets of the monarch were separate from the state's assets. On his accession to the throne, Ludwig II had expressed himself openly and with joy to the constitution, which refused to grant him former absolute rights to the power of the state, although he soon dreamed of a strengthening royal power.Franz Herre, Bayerns Märchenkönig Ludwig II., 6. Aufl., Heyne, München 2001, , S. 95, 108. In any case, the King could no longer dispose of state revenues by virtue of a constitution. The secret and disguised handling of money payments were proof that Ludwig had been aware of this. Bismarck was only able to fulfil his guaranteed money payments on the basis of the fact that larger withdrawals from the Welfs' fund would not have been noticeable, but would also have attacked his stock, which would have contradicted the conditions of seizure. At any rate, Bismarck had also been concerned about the embarrassing secrecy. From the very beginning, he had admitted to the hiding- place, even before the Bavarian government. This was also confirmed by his official announcement of 26 November 1870 on Ludwig's change of meaning – after he had secretly agreed with Holnstein – to the head of the Federal Chancellery, Delbrück. (The Bavarian ministers had already pointed out a letter from Ludwig, which had already been sent to Versailles). All parties were aware of the interests of the Bavarian state on the other hand, and the private interests of the monarch.  Ambiguous assets  Neuschwanstein as a building site, 1886 Thus, there is a great deal of evidence for the interpretation that King Ludwig, outside the Bavarian state budget, had demanded and paid for third-party remuneration for a statutory act, that is, an official act, into his private assets, which according to modern terminology would be corruption. However, it has to be considered that the debate on the accession of Bavaria to the nation of Germany was discussed between 19 November (Telegram sent by Werthern) and 3 December 1870 (sending of the Imperial Letter by Prince Luitpold), including the reserve rights and personal involvement of Ludwig in clarifying the imperial question. For Ludwig, these were related questions, in which he would hardly have distinguished between his person and the state. Ludwig also had to be held to the effect that from his point of view, the separation of state power from royal private wealth was by no means self-evident. At the end of the monarchy of 1918, this question was still to be highly disputed among lawyers and led to the Bavarian law on the Wittelsbach Equalisation Fund. For, at the beginning of the 19th century, to which Ludwig had also descended, had transferred his property to the distressed state (also in accordance with the Bavarian constitution of 1818), and the state had taken over the supply of Wittelsbach. After 1918, jurists of the former royal house argued that in Bavaria a separation between state property and the house wealth of the Wittelsbachs had not yet been carried out. The resulting compromise led to the founding of the Wittelsbach compensation fund, which included the former Wittelsbach property (including the castles of Berg and Hohenschwangau, but not the castles belonging to King Ludwig II, which were retained under state ownership) and whose income since then has been sustained by members of the former Royal family. From the present point of view, no harm was caused to the state as means of Ludwig's conduct. The six million gold marks which had been sent to him as a whole, was demonstrably used to settle construction calculations, for example, the Herrenchiemsee Castle, corresponded approximately to the value of the actual expenses for Neuschwanstein Castle, the most famous of King Ludwig's castles. In 2006 alone, it was visited by over one million people. Even the annual income from this castle for the free state exceeds the sum in question.

Before 1989/90 she was an East German civil rights activist.  Life  = Early years and confrontations with state authority = Freya Klier was born in Dresden, the child of working class parents. Her father, who worked as a painter and decorator, became involved in a fight when she was three, defending his wife. The man whom he hit was an off-duty policeman. Klier's father spent the next twelve months in prison while her mother was switched to night shift work. Freya and her four-year-old brother were sent to a state orphanage. The family were reunited a year later, but the children were from this point marked out as the children of political prisoners, a stigma that affected them adversely until the East German dictatorship finally crumbled into history in 1990. In 1966 her brother, at the time barely seventeen years old, was accused of \\"slandering the state\\" and sentenced to a four-year jail term, following which she resolved to emigrate. As a result of the slaughter of war in the 1940s and massive emigration in the 1950s East Germany was desperately short of working-age population. By 1966 leaving the country - even temporarily - was for most people \\"against the rules\\" and impossible. Freya Klier nevertheless devised a plan to escape with an acquaintance from a Swedish theatre group, armed with a false passport and travelling aboard a Swedish merchant ship. Shortly before the ship was due to sail, in July 1966, she was betrayed and arrested. She was sentenced \\"for attempting to flee the Republic\\" (wegen \\"versuchter Republikflucht\\") to a sixteen-month jail term but served only twelve months, after which the four month balance was \\"suspended\\" for two years. = After school = In 1968 she passed her school final exams (\\"Abitur\\") which under other circumstances would have opened the way to a university-level education, at the same time, due to the subjects studied, earning a diploma in mechanical draftsmanship. Her school years had involved a \\"twin-track\\" path, which for her generation was not unusual. Although she was a member of the party-backed Young Pioneers, outside school she was also participating in religious studies. Later, despite her membership of the party's youth wing (FDJ), she was also involved with the church-sponsored \\"Young Community\\". Once she had finished with school and prison she undertook various low status jobs including waitressing and post office work. She also took \\"behind the scenes\\" work with the Dresden Puppet Theatre. = Theatre career = In 1970, thanks to the intervention of a Party Secretary, Klier was able to embark on a study course at the Theatre Academy in Leipzig, emerging with a degree in 1975. Next she received a contract at the Neue Bühne (theatre) in Senftenberg, a small town in the flat countryside north of Dresden, where she worked as an actress. Alongside the acting she also became increasingly interested in directing. That led to a four-year period of study at the Berlin Institute for Theater direction, for which she received her diploma in 1982. During the early 1980s she worked on productions of works by Fernando Arrabal (at Halle), Friedrich Dürrenmatt (at Bautzen), Carl Sternberg and John Millington Synge (both at Berlin). In the 1970s Klier developed a growing interest in the cultural scene in Poland. That led her, almost unavoidably, to become increasingly critical of the reality of the communist states in central Europe. She tried to present her criticisms both politically and through her artistic work. The East German authorities were never receptive to criticism, however finely it might or might not be nuanced. Accordingly, at this time most of Klier's theatrical productions in East Germany were met with official suspicion or open criticism from the many channels employed by the party. Most of her productions found themselves rapidly cancelled or reconfigured (\\"uminszeniert\\"), so that relatively little survives of her own work. She was, necessarily, a member of the official \\"East German Theatrical Union\\" (\\"Theaterverband der DDR\\"), but found herself prevented from accepting invitations to work in theatres abroad - for instance in Hungary, the Netherlands and West Germany. Sources attribute this to the critical stance detected in much of her theatre work and to her involvement, from 1981, in the church-backed peace movement. Nevertheless, in 1984 she received a director's prize for the premier of \\"Legende vom Glück ohne Ende\\" (\\"Legends of Endless Joy\\") by Ulrich Plenzdorf at the Schwedt Theatre where she was working between 1982 and 1984. Despite, or possibly because of this accolade, she left the theatre that year, and in 1985, after resigning her party membership in April, she was served with a ban on further professional work. = Beyond theatre = Klier became increasingly involved with the Pankow Peace Circle in East Berlin during the early 1980s. The Pankow circle was, for many years, one of the more active and high-profile (but still localised) opposition groups cautiously emerging at the time. She was nevertheless internally conflicted because of her professional goals, and tried to integrate her artistic ambitions and her political goals. That was not always easy. In July 1981 she staged a small production for a church peace festival despite the threat of exclusion from the Institute for Theater direction (at which she was studying). Her preference for true facts also made the authorities nervous. In order to provide a factual basis for the social critique incorporated in and promoted by her artistic work, in 1983 Freya Klier began to make systematic enquiries of women with children about their home lives. She had herself been a single mother since the birth of Nadja, her daughter, in 1973: she knew from personal experience that there was a stark contrast between official propaganda and the actual condition of women in society. But her questionnaire based approach threatened a national taboo. Sociological or demographic studies were to be undertaken only by a small number of researchers who enjoyed the confidence of the party. Otherwise there was an ever-present danger that \\"right theory\\" might be undermined by \\"false empiricism\\". = Stephan Krawczyk = In February 1984 Klier met the songwriter Stephan Krawczyk. At the start of the 1980s he was a member of the still younger generation of artists whom the authorities confidently saw as the great hope for the nation's artistic future. He had won first prize at the 1981 National Song Festival and was, naturally, a party member. It was only in April 1985 that he resigned his party membership\\". Krawczyk had by this time become something of an iconic figure, especially for younger East German fans: later in 1985 he and Klier were both served with what amounted to a nationwide ban on professional work (Berufsverbot), which was linked with exclusion from the national \\"Theatrical Union\\" (\\"Theaterverband\\"). The authorities, with a characteristic absence of subtelty, sought to destroy Krawczyk's fan base, describing him as a \\"national enemy\\" (\\"Staatsfeind\\") and even as the \\"new Wolf Biermann\\". = Opposing dictatorship = Over the next twelve months the two of them worked together on a programme of dramatic pieces and prose readings critical of the \\"socialist\\" society. These received supportive responses from audiences of church groups and in community halls. The authorities responded by pressuring the church authorities to block their appearances. But as matters turned out there were more and more churches and community groups that continued to provide them with venues for their presentations. Klier and Krawczyk (who married in 1986) also found themselves deluged with official ordinances and injunctions. During 1985, believing that she had identified the roots of the country's dictatorship in its education system, Klier began a new questionnaire-based research project into the East German education and training system. She conducted structured interviews with young people and, from 1986, with teachers, revealing a picture of a society riddled with dishonesty, depression and hopelessness. At the same time she found that the limits of the state's ideological power to influence had been reached, and that most young people of the 80s generation - if only inwardly - resisted the party's preposterous claims for the society over which it presided. Klier's researches were written up and presented early in 1990 in her book \\"Lüg Vaterland. Erziehung in der DDR\\" (loosely: \\"Lie, Fatherland: Education in East Germany\\"), the publication of which excited much attention during a critical year in East German history. While Klier and Krawczyk were still in East Germany she communicated the results of her researches in Samizdat publications, and incorporated them into presentations critical of the social system that she continued to give in churches or private homes. The Ministry for State Security (Stasi) subjected them both to a programme of intense monitoring, identified in their files as \\"Operation Sinus\\" (\\"OV Sinus\\"). As a result of Stasi interventions it became increasingly difficult to organise presentations. Their car was tampered with several times: on at least one occasion the brake cable on one side was cut. Krawczyk experience a nerve gas attack as he was opening the car door. Wie sehr Freya Klier als Staatsfeind angesehen wurde, zeigte die schon zu offensichtliche Verfolgung durch die Stasi, mehrere Manipulationen an ihrem Auto oder Mordversuch vom 8. November 1987. In addition to conventional harassment techniques Klier and Krawczyk were subjected to the ministry's infamous Psychological Degradation (\\"Zersetzung\\") tactics which were, as intended, psychologically damaging. Nevertheless, unlike her sixteen year old self, Freya Klier was now determined to stay the course and not to abandon East Germany. In October 1986 Klier was a co-founder of the \\"Solidarity Church\\", an opposition group that sought to create a network across the country that took a critical position in respect of the one-party dictatorship, and she became a member of its co-ordination committee. She was nevertheless not without her own criticisms of it. Her personal experiences made her all too conscious of the shortage of that \\"solidarity\\" which the group purported to represent, and she called for more radical thought and action. Her contribution was more individualistic and less \\"collegiate\\" than that of many of the opposition activists in the build-up to the so-called \\"Peaceful Revolution\\". She always remained in touch with the more important of the opposition groups, however. Because her activities involved much travelling between the country's various regions, she was able to network intensively between opposition groups on a personal level. In November 1987 Klier and Krawczyk sent a joint open letter to the party's top ideologist, Kurt Hager. Copies of this letter were widely distributed through the usual informal channels across East Germany and it was also published in the West German media. It was read out at a church concert on 9 November 1987. The letter criticised social conditions in East Germany and called for extensive reforms. At the same time Klier and Krawczyk agreed together to take part in the annual mass parade held each year in January to honour Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, two pioneers of German Communism who had been assassinated during months of revolution that followed the First World War. The 69th anniversary of the killings was to be commemorated on 17 January 1988, a Sunday. It was an officially sanctioned and promoted celebration. However, Klier and Krawczyk intended to attend it in order to display banners of their own devising. The idea was to draw attention to their own work bans and to highlight more generally their criticisms of the East German social structure. However, at the last minute they learned that other dissident demonstrators had planned to use the event to highlight government refusal to permit them to emigrate to the west, an issue that had never gone away. It was anticipated that western television teams would attempt to report the demonstration, and in order to avoid the risk of \\"mixed messaging\\" Klier and Krawczyk decided to leave their own alternative banners at home. Weeks in advance, and well informed as ever, the Ministry for State Security had made their own plans to deal with dissident disruption of the 17 January 1988 celebration. In a series of house arrests immediately before the event approximately 120 civil rights activists were arrested and held for (and in some cases beyond) the duration of the event. (Other sources give the number arrested as 160.) Those arrested included Vera Wollenberger, Herbert Mißlitz and Stephan Krawczyk. Some dissidents nevertheless did participate in the demonstration, and despite the best endeavours of Ministry for State Security officials, several \\"unauthorized\\" banners appears on international television reports. The one that resonated most widely used a quote from Rosa Luxemburg herself: \\"Freedom is always the freedom to think differently\\" (\\"Die Freiheit ist immer die Freiheit des Andersdenkenden\\"). Freya Klier, still at liberty, reacted to the arrests with an appeal, widely reported, to artists in West Germany that they should show solidarity with comrades in the east by not themselves performing in East Germany. A few days later there was another wave of arrests. Leading opposition figures targeted now included Regina and Wolfgang Templin, Werner Fischer, Bärbel Bohley, Ralf Hirsch and Freya Klier herself. East German media launched a reinvigorated defamation campaign against those detained, but in West Germany and from opposition groups in other Soviet sponsored states in central Europe there came various declarations of support and solidarity. Nevertheless, there were also certain West German politicians who placed on record their \\"understanding\\" for the measures taken. = Expulsion = Inside East Germany the arrests unleashed the largest wave of solidarity with political prisoners since 1953. That was not apparent to the detainees themselves, however, since the only lawyers to whom they were given access were some employed by the Stasi themselves. Not only did these lawyers fail to tell their clients what was going on \\"outside\\": they also assured their \\"clients\\" that no one \\"outside\\" was showing the slightest interest in their fate. Shortly afterwards the lawyer assigned to Freya Klier, Wolfgang Schnur, greatly surprised her when he went public with vehement criticism of his client. It was only some years later, when the Stasi files were opened up, that his role as a Stasi collaborator would become apparent. In fact the demonstrations and the subsequent arrests were being discussed at the highest level. A Politburo meeting took place on Tuesday 2 February 1988. The government felt more insecure than many western commentators assumed at the time, faced with a growing surge of street protests at home and growing uncertainty over whether, in the era of Glasnost, the authorities could still rely on fraternal military support from the Soviet Union of the kind employed the last time total breakdown had threatened, back in 1953 (or more recently, in Czechoslovakia, in 1968). Applying a strategy of damage limitation the Politburo decided to expel the imprisoned dissidents to the west. As presented to media by the government lawyer Wolfgang Vogel, this meant that all the detainees would be released, including those in the Stasi's special Hohenschönhausen jail facing treason charges, and each one could freely choose whether he or she wished to be released in the east or in the west. Threatened with long years of imprisonment, Klier and Krawczyk agreed to expulsion from East Germany. Most (though not all) of the other dissidents arrested at the same time, each subjected to their own differing sets of pressures and conditions, were persuaded to reach the same conclusion. However, in the west Klier and Krawczyk were the most \\"high-profile\\" of the dissidents expelled. All the expelled dissidents stated that one way or another they had been forced to agree to expulsion. On arriving in the west Klier's first public action was arrange for her lawyer to read a sixteen line prepared statement to the television cameras stressing that she and Krawcyk had not left their country voluntarily, and were keen to return home as soon as possible. There were nevertheless accusations of betrayal from a number of \\"left-wing\\" East German dissidents left behind. A few days later Klier and Krawczyk gave an interview to Der Spiegel setting out their situation and some of the background to it more fully, and describing the treatment to which they had been subjected following their arrest. They repeated in the strongest possible terms their insistence that there had been nothing voluntary about their sudden appearance in the west. There were many church representatives and others, committed to a \\"softly softly\\" approach to trying to bring Glasnost to East Germany, who criticised the decision by Klier and Krawczyk to encourage publicity for their situation. However, neither Klier nor Krawczyk had, in recent years, shown much interest in \\"low-profile\\" activism. In the dissident congregations and meetings in East Germany there is reason to believe that the events that followed the 17 January 1988 demonstration, and the publicity they attracted, served only to increase pressure on the state authorities and to hasten the regime's demise and thereby the return of democracy after not quite 58 years of one-party dictatorship. = Life in the west = Freya Klier settled in West Berlin. Two years later Berlin was reunified in the wider context of the reunification process. Her marriage to Stephan Krawczyk lasted only till 1992. Today she lives as a freelance author, stage director and film maker. She ranges widely across political topics, but the East German dictatorship, along with the Nazi dictatorship that preceded it, feature prominently among her themes. She also retains a role as a political activist, working in political education and making regular presentations in schools. In 1996 she was a founding instigator of the Bürgerbüro initiative in Berlin which provides advice and support for surviving victims of East German's one-party dictatorship. She remains active in the movement which also provides support for her own research projects. Since 2006 she has been a leading member of the P.E.N. international organisation for German-language authors abroad (\\"Deutscher PEN-Club im Exil\\"). Within the organisation, since 2006 she has headed up the \\"Writers in Prison\\" group.  Family  Freya Klier's daughter, , has achieved notability on her own account as a Berlin-based photographer and film maker.

Consumers or manufacturers can use the standards to evaluate the extent to which a product protects various digital rights including consumer privacy, information security, freedom of speech, and product ownership. A consortium of organizations including Consumer Reports, Disconnect Mobile, Ranking Digital Rights, The Cyber Independent Testing Lab, and Aspiration presented the standard in March 2017. Using the standard The intended use for the standard is to encourage any consumer or manufacturer to evaluate and discuss the impact which any product's digital features have on individuals and society. Since the standard is a list of questions, anyone can answer the questions for any product to generate an evaluation. Supporters of the standard argue that the answers to the questions should either be obvious or the manufacturers should voluntarily disclose the answers. Goals of the standard include setting consumer expectations for how products should protect them, communicating acceptable practices to manufacturers, and encouraging conversations about what sorts of product behavior are either beneficial or harmful to the consumers who use them. Evaluation criteria The digital standard makes 4 assertions about digital rights: #manufacturers should provide information security with their products #manufacturers should provide Internet privacy with their products #manufacturers should design products for consumer ownership #manufacturers should be ethical and accountable for whatever impact their products have From the foundation of these assertions, the digital standard claims that good products will have the following characteristics: *user can see and know whatever data the product collects *users can export any data they have contributed *user owns the product *user information secure from intrusion and hacking *product default is for maximum privacy *user can delete account and all submitted content *product is safe from software vulnerability *company discloses how they use user's data *anyone can examine the product's software *the product will continue to work after the manufacture ceases supporting it Public participation The standard is a work in progress which is actively seeking comments and participation from anyone who cares about digital rights. Responses At the time of the standard's release the organizations which established it made their own statements about their contributions and how they are partnering with others. A representative of the Consumer Technology Association expressed a wish that the anyone using the standard to evaluate a product should describe how they calculated a score and the limitations on what a score communicates.

Each season, students from all over China audition to participate in a two-week training residency before performing alongside a renowned soloist and conductor in premier venues throughout the world. The entire program is provided at no cost to students; all expenses, including tuition, travel, housing, and meals, are covered by the organization's supporters. NYO-China was founded in late 2015 with its first residency and concert tour, featuring Yuja Wang and Olga Kern, taking place in July 2017. Its subsequent seasons included a reduced-scale Chamber Series in 2018 and a Europe Tour in 2019 with Garrick Ohlsson. Ludovic Morlot served as the orchestra's conductor for both its 2017 and 2019 seasons.  Eligibility and auditions  To be eligible to join NYO-China, applicants must be between 14 and 21 years old when the residency and concert tour takes place. All applicants must also be citizens of the People's Republic of China, although they are permitted to be students and/or permanent residents in other countries. Auditions are conducted online in the winter and spring preceding each residency. Requirements include a short biographical essay, a letter of recommendation from a music teacher, and videos of various selected excerpts and a piece of the applicant's choice. All alumni are required to submit a new application if they wish to join the ensemble for its forthcoming season, and no advantage is given to applicants for having previously performed in the orchestra. In its first year, NYO-China received slightly over 1,000 applicants, of whom 110 were accepted and 105 matriculated. Subsequent seasons saw similarly competitive admissions. Across its three seasons, the orchestra has represented musicians residing in over twenty provinces or administrative divisions of China, as well as Singapore, Germany, and the United States. The average age of participants is 18 years, with about half enrolled in secondary school and the other half enrolled in postsecondary school. Postsecondary institutions represented in this orchestra include the Central Conservatory of Music, the China Conservatory of Music, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, the Juilliard School, and the Curtis Institute of Music, among over a dozen others.  Residency and concert tours  = 2017 season = The National Youth Orchestra of China (in red) rehearsing alongside the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America (in blue) at Purchase College on July 16, 2017. The inaugural NYO- China, comprising 105 students, gathered in early July on East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania to begin their two-week residency under artistic director Jindong Cai, professor of conducting at Stanford University, and a suite of bilingual teaching artists recruited from leading orchestras worldwide; concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic Frank Huang served as the teaching artist for the orchestra's violin section.WQXR Besides full orchestral and sectional rehearsals, students also attended seminars and workshops on Alexander Technique with Lori Schiff and improvisation with Eugene Friesen, as well as chamber music activities coordinated by the residency's staff. Students also recorded with WQXR-FM and From the Top on NPR, participated in excursions to Yale University and New York City, and rehearsed with Carnegie Hall’s National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America (NYO-USA) at their residency at Purchase College in New York.The National Youth Orchestra of China performing with Yuja Wang and Ludovic Morlot (hidden) at Carnegie Hall on July 22, 2017. Music Director of the Seattle Symphony Ludovic Morlot joined the orchestra to lead rehearsals during the latter half of the residency. On July 22, the orchestra premiered at Carnegie Hall’s 2804-seat Main Hall (Stern Auditorium/Perelman Stage) with Morlot conducting and Yuja Wang performing on piano in a sold-out concert simultaneously streamed to audiences worldwide via Medici.tv. In attendance was the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America, which itself had performed one day prior on the same stage. The orchestra then embarked on a concert tour of China, performing at the Beijing Concert Hall, the Shanghai Oriental Art Center, and the Suzhou Culture and Arts Centre. Winner of the 11th Van Cliburn International Piano Competition Olga Kern joined the orchestra for its performances in China. As part of their official performance uniform, students adorned specially commissioned vests designed by Chinese couture designer Guo Pei. The orchestra’s concert program included “The Rhyme of Taigu” by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Zhou Long; Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat Minor by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky; and Symphony No. 9 in E Minor “From the New World” (popularly known as the New World Symphony) by Antonín Leopold Dvořák. “Thunder in the Drought”, a Chinese folk song arranged for orchestra by Ye Xiaogang, served as the ensemble's encore piece. NYO-China's 2017 residency and concert tour is the subject of an upcoming documentary by Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Christine Choy. = 2018 season = NYO- China returned in 2018 as a smaller program for 21 students centered around the art and performance of chamber music. Following a residency at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing with musicians Qing Li, Yong Ma, and Guang Chen, students performed alongside faculty at multiple venues throughout mainland China; these included: the Yale Center Beijing, the Central Conservatory of Music Opera & Concert Hall, New York University Shanghai, the Chuansha Piano Festival, and the Qingdao Eurochestries Festival. Select students were also invited to perform alongside members of the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America at a private recital at the United States Embassy in Beijing with United States Ambassador to China Terry Branstad in attendance. = 2019 season = The National Youth Orchestra of China with Ludovic Morlot at the Konzerthaus Berlin on August 5, 2019.The 2019 season saw the return of the full orchestra, with 101 students gathering for a residency at Shanghai University in July. As was the case in 2017, each section was taught by a dedicated faculty member recruited from among the principal players of preeminent international orchestras. The program's 2017 conductor Ludovic Morlot also returned to lead rehearsals throughout the entire duration of the residency. On August 1, the orchestra premiered at the Shanghai Oriental Art Center with pianist Garrick Ohlsson, the first and only American to win the International Chopin Piano Competition. It then traveled to Berlin, Germany to make its European debut at Young Euro Classic, a festival of renowned youth orchestras including the European Union Youth Orchestra, the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America, and the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain held annually at the Konzerthaus Berlin; the sold-out concert was also broadcast live to audiences throughout Europe on ARTE. The orchestra then continued to Snape, Suffolk in the United Kingdom to perform at the Snape Proms, and thereafter concluded its tour in Bolzano, Italy with a concert at the Bolzano Festival Bolzen. Ambassador alt= While in the United Kingdom, select students were invited to perform at the Embassy of China in London in a chamber concert attended and hosted by Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Liu Xiaoming. Chinese Ambassador to Germany Wu Ken was also in attendance at the orchestra's performance in Berlin and met with students following their concert. The program featured the “Tianjin Suite” by Ye Xiaogang; Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat minor (commonly referred to as the Emperor Concerto) by Ludwig van Beethoven; and Symphony No. 5 in D minor by Dmitri Shostakovich. Encores for this season included “Dance of the Drayman” from Shostakovich's The Bolt and an orchestral arrangement of the popular Chinese folk song “Jasmine Flower”. = Future seasons = In December 2019, NYO-China announced plans for a 2020 Sinfonietta Series that would bring students to Moscow, Russia among various other destinations in mainland China. In celebration of the 250th anniversary of Beethoven's birth, the ensemble will be performing his Coriolan Overture and Symphony No. 7 in A minor; other pieces on the program include Felix Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E minor and Caroline Shaw's Entr'acte. The ensemble will feature violinist Simone Porter and once again be led by Ludovic Morlot. NYO-China's Managing Director Vincent Accettola has indicated plans to take the orchestra to a different continent or geographic locus every season. While not yet formally scheduled, prospective tour destinations for future seasons include Australia and Oceania, North America, Scandinavia, and the Mediterranean.  Critical reception  NYO-China's 2017 debut at Carnegie Hall conducted by Ludovic Morlot and featuring pianist Yuja Wang received pronounced critical acclaim from various American music columns and publications. Anthony Tommasini, the chief classical music critic for The New York Times, remarked that “if [the performance at Carnegie Hall] was a test run for this new venture, these Chinese musicians scored big”; he furthermore commended Morlot for his “vibrant account of Dvořák’s New World Symphony from the well-prepared players, with full-bodied string tone, folkloric charm and lots of brio.” The orchestra's subsequent performances in Beijing, Shanghai, and Suzhou with Olga Kern on piano were also applauded by numerous Chinese critics, including those belonging to China Daily, People’s Daily, and the Xinhua News Agency. NYO- China's 2018 and 2019 tours were also warmly received. The orchestra's performance in Berlin, Germany with pianist Garrick Ohlsson was especially praised, with Der Tagesspiegel celebrating the ensemble's power and artistic prowess.  Management and funding  Composer Ye Xiaogang acts as the ceremonial Tuanzhang (or “Head”) of the National Youth Orchestra of China, while Chinese businesswoman and education philanthropist He Mei serves as the founding benefactor of the project. Vincent Accettola and Owen Brown – former roommates at Yale University at the time of the project's conception – formed NYO-China's inaugural management team, serving as the program's Managing Director and Director of Development, respectively. Social entrepreneur Sabrina Xu also serves as a Project Director. American classical pianist and Dean of the Yale School of Music Robert Blocker assists the team as a senior advisor. In January 2020, French conductor Ludovic Morlot, Music Director Emeritus of the Seattle Symphony and NYO-China's featured conductor during its 2017 and 2019 seasons, was announced as the organization's Artistic Director. Executive and Artistic Director of Carnegie Hall Sir Clive Gillinson and the staff of the Weill Music Institute were instrumental in assisting NYO-China during the first year of its organization. The motivating insight to create a national youth orchestra for China was provided by Gillinson during the National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America's 2015 China tour given the especially warm reception the ensemble received from young Chinese audiences. Other corporations, organizations, and state institutions that were helpful in the development of NYO-China include Steinway & Sons, the Yale School of Music, the China Symphony Development Foundation, the Chinese Musicians Association, Bright Food, the China Institute, the Committee of 100, the US-China Youth Education Solutions Foundation, and the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in New York.

According to a U.S. Navy press release, the breach \\"resulted in flooding to nearby compartments, including crew berthing, machinery, and communications rooms.\\" Ten US Navy sailors died as a result of the crash, which prompted the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) of Singapore to start a multi-agency SAR effort as the agency responsible for coordinating SAR operations within Singapore's Maritime Search and Rescue Region (MSRR). The Singapore Transport Safety Bureau (TSIB) also launched a marine safety investigation following the collision in accordance with the International Maritime Organisation's Casualty Investigation Code in Singapore's capacity as a coastal state, and published its final report on 8 March 2018. The U.S. Navy announced on 24 August 2017 that it had suspended search-and-rescue efforts for survivors in the open sea to focus on the recovery of the remains of the missing sailors still inside the flooded compartments of the ship. By 27 August U.S. Navy and United States Marine Corps divers had recovered the remains of all ten sailors. On 12 September 2017, the United States' chargé d'affaires Stephanie Syptak-Ramnath expressed thanks for Singapore's support during the SAR operations. The McCain returned to service in June of 2020.  Investigation of incident  Immediately after the incident the U.S. Navy reports suggested a fatigued bridge crew, poor communication between crew members and crowded shipping lanes as the most likely culprits. CNN quoted an unnamed \\"Navy official\\" stating that the ship lost steering control shortly before the accident but that \\"it was unclear why the crew couldn't use the ship's backup steering systems\\". The collision was the second such incident in just over two months, with the first one occurring between John S. McCains sister ship and container ship . On the same day as the collision between John S. McCain and Alnic MC, the Pentagon ordered all fleet operations around the world to make a brief \\"operational pause\\" for safety checks during the following two weeks, as well as beginning a full safety review. The U.S. 7th Fleet commander at the time of the accident, Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, was relieved of his position on 23 August 2017 for \\"loss of confidence in his ability to command\\". Rear Admiral Richard Brown was named to lead an internal investigation of the accident. Brown is a former commander of another sister ship, and currently serves as commander of Naval Personnel Command and deputy chief of Naval Personnel. On 18 September 2017, the new U.S. 7th Fleet commander, Vice Admiral Phillip Sawyer, as part of the investigations into four surface ship incidents involving Navy ships in the Western Pacific in 2017, including the collision involving John S. McCain, ordered that Rear Admiral Charles Williams, Commander Task Force 70, and Captain Jeffrey Bennett, commodore of Destroyer Squadron 15, be removed from their positions due to a loss of confidence in their ability to command. On 10 October 2017, John S. McCains commanding officer, CDR Alfredo J. Sanchez and executive officer, CDR Jessie L. Sanchez, were both relieved due to a loss of confidence. A statement from U.S. 7th Fleet Public Affairs stated that \\"while the investigation is ongoing, it is evident the collision was preventable, the commanding officer exercised poor judgment, and the executive officer exercised poor leadership of the ship’s training program.\\" Commander Ed Angelinas, former commanding officer of , and Lieutenant Commander Ray Ball, chief engineer of , were appointed acting commanding officer and acting executive officer of John S. McCain. In August 2019, Admiral Bill Galinis, who oversees U.S. Navy ship design, said the touchscreen-based control systems were \\"overly complex\\" because shipbuilders had little guidance on how they should work, so sailors were not sure where key indicators could be found on the screen; this confusion contributed to the collision. The Navy is planning to replace all touchscreens with wheels and throttles on all of its ships, starting in mid-2020. = Initial US Navy report = On 1 November 2017, the US Navy issued a \\"Memorandum for distribution\\". The memorandum defines the legal privilege of such reports, but in the interests of transparency authorizes the release of the two reports covering collisions of Fitzgerald and John McCain. The two reports are annexed to the memorandum. The reports are intended to be authoritative, but are not balanced; they specifically exclude a detailed examination of the actions of and Alnic MC respectively. The report for John S. McCain detailed the following; * On 20 August, navigation briefs were prepared for the transit of the Singapore Strait and rudder swing checks were performed. Shortly after midnight, a log entry revealed that one radar was inoperable. * After 01:00, more frequent position checks were recorded as the ship approached the straits and the Commanding Officer (CO) was on the bridge. * At 02:16, the ship's propulsion configuration was changed. Normally the two propeller shafts are controlled as one at the Ship's Control Console (SCC), but for increased maneuverability, they can be separated so that the port and starboard shafts are each controlled by its own throttle.Chief of Naval Operations (2017), p 62 * At 04:18, the ship changed to \\"Modified Navigation Detail\\", in which additional watchstanders were present on the bridge. This was normal for a U.S. Navy ship when approaching within of shallow water.Chief of Naval Operations (2017), p 45 * From 04:27, the position was determined and logged at 5-minute intervals.Chief of Naval Operations (2017), p 63 * At 04:36, the ship switched from automatic to manual control of steering. Various changes of course were required to avoid shipping, but they were not logged. * At 04:54, there was radar contact with Alnic MC, ahead at a range of under . * John S. McCain continued to make small alteration of course to avoid other vessels and by 05:18 was running at on a bearing of 230T. To keep this course against a tidal stream, she was carrying between 1 and 4 degrees of right rudder. * Shortly thereafter, the CO realized that the helmsman was having difficulty in managing both the helm and the propulsion control and ordered the helm to be transferred to the Lee Helm watch station.Chief of Naval Operations (2017), p 64 * At 05:20:39, control of the helm passed to the Lee Helm position, the change bringing the rudder amidships. * At 05:20:47, the Lee Helm also took control of the port shaft. * At 05:21, the Lee Helm reported that he had lost steering and the Conning Officer ordered steering control to the offline steering units and the aft control position was ordered manned. Port and starboard steering were transferred to the aft position at 05:21:13 and 05:21:15, respectively. * At 05:22, the ship was turning to port and the CO ordered the external lights to be changed to \\"ship not under command\\", a warning to all vessels that the Navy ship could not control her course.Chief of Naval Operations (2017), p 65 * Over the next minute, the Lee Helm took control of the starboard shaft, not realizing that the port throttle was uncoupled. The CO ordered a reduction in speed, but only the port propeller was slowed, thereby increasing the turn to port. * The Executive Officer warned the CO that the ship was not slowing, so the CO ordered a further reduction in speed, increasing the rate of turn. The CO should have announced that he was personally taking control of maneuvering, but failed to do so. * The Conning Officer ordered \\"right standard rudder\\" to turn to starboard at 05:23 and a second later the after steering position took control. * 15 seconds later, the main Helm position regained control in \\"Backup manual mode\\". * At 05:23:24, the throttles were finally matched and the ship started to slow. * Three seconds later, the aft helmsman took back control of the steering. The report notes that this was the fifth change of control in two minutes. * At 05:23:44, fifteen degrees of rudder was ordered and John S. McCain finally ceased to turn. * Fourteen seconds later, at 05:23:58, the collision occurred.Chief of Naval Operations (2017), p 66 The ship's user interface was found to have contributed to the sailors' confusion. At no point did either ship sound a warning signal of five short blasts on the whistle (Colregs rule 34(d)) or attempt to contact the other via VHF radio.Chief of Naval Operations (2017), p 48 The report describes the actions taken in the aftermath of the collision. On page 49 it states that the external lights were changed to \\"red over red\\" (\\"vessel not under command\\"), but the timeline on page 65 claims that this was done at 05:22, at least a minute before the collision. The report criticizes John S. McCain under two headings: \\"Seamanship and Navigation\\" and \\"Leadership and Culture\\". The former heading mentions that a higher state of readiness was required in congested waters, that the \\"Sea and Anchor\\" detail should have been set earlier and that both vessels failed to sound the required signals or use VHF. The latter heading contains criticisms about the ship's organization. Specifically the CO did not set the Sea and Anchor watch, watchstanders had not attended the navigation brief, leadership failed to assign sufficient experienced officers, the CO issued unplanned orders which were not communicated to the watch officers, who in turn failed to provide input and backup to the CO.Chief of Naval Operations (2017), p 60 = NTSB Accident report = On June 19, 2019 the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released their report on the accident. Their finding that the probable cause of the incident was a \\"lack of effective operational oversight of the destroyer by the US Navy, which resulted in insufficient training and inadequate bridge operating procedures.\\" Along with their complete report they provided a series of recommendations including changes to Navy bridge equipment and training procedures. This is the first independent investigation document released on any of the recent US Navy navigation incidents.  Transport to Yokosuka  John S. McCain aboard the MV Treasure, 7 October 2017 On 6 September 2017, Military Sealift Command awarded a contract to Dockwise, a marine transport company, to move the damaged John S. McCain in late September from Singapore to a US repair facility in Yokosuka, Japan where a damage assessment was completed. Repairs were expected to take up to a year at an estimated cost of US$230 million. She left Singapore on 11 October 2017 aboard the heavy transport ship , bound for Yokosuka. For most of 2018, John S. McCain was in drydock for repairs at Fleet Activities Yokosuka. In November 2018, the ship left drydock and was transferred to a pier to continue her repairs, that are expected to be finished in late 2019.USS John S.

The A class of the Swedish State Railways (SJ) was a type of steam locomotive built in 1906-1909 for hauling mainline express trains. The 26 locomotives were built to replace older types that could not cope with the increasingly heavy express trains, but soon became insufficient themselves. They were relegated to less important passenger trains, and five were transferred to then-independent Ostkustbanan (OKB) in the 1920s, but returned when that company was nationalized in 1933. OKB and SJ had a total of eight locomotives rebuilt, replacing the trailing wheels with an extra pair of driving wheels. The locomotives that had not been rebuilt were scrapped in the late 1930s, except for number 1001 which is preserved at the Swedish Railway Museum, but the rebuilt ones survived until the early 1970s. OKB also built two locomotives of a related design, but with a smaller driving wheel diameter. These were also taken over by SJ and were in regular use until 1961; one has been preserved. The A class locomotives were the first of SJ with superheaters, and have been described as the first modern steam locomotives in Sweden. Some parts introduced with the A class were to become SJ standard, fitted to several types of locomotives. The tender designed for the A class was also used for the much more numerous B class.  History  The first express train locomotives of SJ were the 2-2-2 A class of 1863, designed by Beyer, Peacock and Company, and the 2-4-0 C (later Ca) class of 1875, designed by Borsig in Berlin. These locomotives were too small when trains became heavier, particularly after bogie carriages were introduced by SJ in 1891, and double heading was often needed. The Ca class was developed into the 4-4-0 Cb and Cc classes, which also quickly became insufficient. SJ started working on a new fast locomotive that was to be capable of hauling seven carriages with an average weight of in on flat ground and in on long 1 in 100 gradients. The new type was designed from scratch by SJ and built by Swedish companies; 11 locomotives were built by NOHAB and 15 by Motala Verkstad between 1906 and 1909. The new type became the A class, as there no longer remained any Beyer, Peacock locomotives with that designation. The use of the first letter of the alphabet was probably symbolical, as was the numbering: the first member of the class became number 1000, despite other contemporary locomotives having numbers in the 800s. Most of the gap was filled in later, but number 999 remains vacant. The A class was given a 4-4-2 or Atlantic wheel arrangement and driving wheels. They differed in many ways from previous types, and have been described as the first modern steam locomotives in Sweden. They were the first superheated locomotives of SJ, being equipped with Schmidt type superheaters. The boiler and running boards were given a rather high placement, above the driving wheels. The class had a bar frame and inside cylinders. They were delivered with six-wheeled C class tenders, but these were replaced with new A class tenders in 1909-1911. Some parts introduced with the A class were to become SJ standard, fitted to several types of locomotives. At this time, the Swedish railways had a general speed limit of only 90 km/h, but the A class was considerably faster. Number 1000 is said to have reached during trials in 1906, but it was not officially recorded (the official Swedish record for steam locomotives, held by an H3 class locomotive of private company Bergslagernas Järnvägar, is a mere ). The performance of the A class met the specifications, but once again the newest type of locomotive soon became insufficient. Direct services to Germany began in 1909, and the new carriages built for this traffic weighted , as opposed to the 30 tonnes calculated when designing the A class. Wheelslip was a common problem. It was also impossible to lower the journey times further using the A class. The 4-6-0 B class, introduced in 1909, was also capable of running in 90 km/h on flat ground and 50 km/h on gradients, and was stronger than the A class. Intended for fast freight trains and heavy stopping passenger trains, it was also frequently used in express trains. It was followed in 1914 by the large F class, a 4-6-2 compound locomotive, designed for hauling trains of and used in express trains on the Southern Main Line until electrification. The A class was relegated to less important passenger trains until electrification made them unnecessary in that role too. Two of the A class locomotives were used for experiments with peat-based fuel between 1926 and 1932, and were once again given C class tenders during this period. Five others were transferred to Ostkustbanan in 1926-1927, and three were rebuilt by SJ to a 4-6-0 wheel arrangement in 1930. Number 1001 was allocated to the Swedish Railway Museum in 1937, and has been on display since 1942 with some parts cut open to show how a steam locomotive works. The remaining 4-4-2 locomotives were scrapped in , most of them in Vislanda.  Rebuilding  = OKB A = The railway between Gävle and Härnösand was built by the private company Ostkustbanan (OKB), the first section opening in 1923. The company was troubled financially from its inception, and depended on loans from the state; it was controlled by the Swedish government from 1924. As part of the state aid, five A class and twelve E class locomotives were transferred from SJ to OKB before the start of large-scale traffic in 1927, retaining their old class designations. OKB also found the performance of the A class unsatisfactory, and had them rebuilt at Motala Verkstand in 1929 to a 4-6-0 wheel arrangement. OKB was nationalized in 1933, and the locomotives were returned to SJ where they regained their old numbers but were given the new A3 class designation. Two A2 class locomotives were rebuilt to the A3 class in 1939 and 1940. Most of the locomotives were again given C class tenders for some time, and several were modified for wood- firing during the Second World War and equipped with smoke deflectors of the Wagner type. They became the A class once again when many locomotive types were given new designations in 1942, and remained on the East Coast Line until electrification, when they were placed in the strategic reserve. The strategic reserve was made up of surplus steam locomotives, preserved in usable condition to replace diesel-powered vehicles if the import of oil was interrupted. In the 1960s, some trial runs were done with locomotives from the strategic reserve, including the A class, and the outcome of these trials was that SJ decided to remove all steam locomotives except the B, E, E2 and E10 classes from the reserve. Number 1008 was the last member of the A class in use when it did a trial run in 1968. All the rebuilt A class locomotives were scrapped between 1969 and 1972. = SJ A2 = SJ also wanted to improve the performance of their A class locomotives, and three were rebuilt in 1930, creating the 4-6-0 A2 class. Unlike the OKB locomotives, the A2 class also received new boilers of the standard BGb type, first introduced with the B class. Two of the A2 class locomotives were rebuilt to the A3 class in 1939 and 1940, with boilers of the original A class type, as the BGb type boilers were needed elsewhere. The sole remaining A2 locomotive was used together with the A3 class until scrapped in 1970.  Related development  = OKB H = The A class locomotives acquired by OKB were not only unsatisfactory, but also too few, and passenger trains sometimes had to be hauled by the slower E class. In 1928 the railway bought two H class locomotives from Motala Verkstad. They were a compromise between the H3 class, popular with Swedish private railways, and the A class, having the six driving wheels of the H3 class, but many other components that were identical to the A class, including the boiler and leading bogie. The boiler was placed unusually high on the frame, to the extent that the locomotives were too high to be used on some railway lines. After nationalization they became the OKa class of SJ. The first two letters indicated that the type had been inherited from OKB, but this unpractical system was abandoned in 1942. The OKa class then became the A3 class, the previous A3 class having been renamed A. The original tenders of the H class were six-wheeled; they were similar to the SJ L class tender, but after nationalization they were designated first OKa and later A3 like the locomotives they belonged to. Most SJ tenders were given new designations in 1947, and the A3 class tender became the C2 class, together with various other tenders inherited from private railways. The A3 locomotives had standard A class tenders during two periods in the 1940s, but the original tenders were returned to them both times. After nationalization the locomotives initially remained on the East Coast Line, but they were also used between Gävle and Ånge. They were later used on a number of lines: the Bohus Line in the early 1940s, in Bergslagen from 1945, between Nässjö and Kalmar in the early 1950s, and finally in Dalarna between 1956 and 1961. At some point they were given smoke deflectors of the Witte type. They were eventually placed in the strategic reserve, and one has been preserved by a society in Sundsvall, while the other was scrapped in 1975. = A class tender = The A class tender was also used with B class locomotives. This image of preserved B 1220 shows the shape of the Gölsdorf type tender. The A class locomotives were delivered with six-wheeled C class tenders, but new A class tenders were delivered between 1909 and 1911. It was a bogie tender of the Gölsdorf model, derived from the R class tender, which was based on a tender type of the Austrian railways. The tender had an empty weight of , and could carry of coal and of water. It became something of a standard type: all the 96 B class locomotives built for SJ were given A class tenders, and later also some locomotives of the C, E, E2, G6 and L classes.

Summary Chapter 1 starts from the observation that recent work on contact linguistics in well understood social contexts provides a new platform for trying to use evidence for historical language change as evidence for past social contexts and interactions. It emphasises the role of human social interactions in language change, rather than viewing language change as happening abstractly outside human interactions. A key premise is that people often adopt a new language because it is socially expedient to do so, but learn it with an accent determined by their native language. In some circumstances, this can lead to the pronunciation of the expanding language to change among all its speakers. A simple way to put many of Schrijver's arguments is to say that different Germanic dialects came to be spoken with the foreign accents of people who switched language to Germanic: thus Old English came to be characterised by a British Celtic accent, Old High German by a late Latin accent, and so forth. The book focuses on the history of the Germanic languages but discusses the Finnic languages, Romance languages and Celtic languages extensively. Compared with other academic studies in historical linguistics, it is written in a usually plain and accessible style. Chapter 2, 'The Rise of English', focuses on the much debated question of whether English, and particularly Old English, shows any sign of contact between the West Germanic-speaking immigrants who became the Anglo-Saxons and the speakers of British Celtic and Latin whom these immigrants encountered during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain around the fifth century CE. The chapter argues that Middle English betrays the belated appearance of contact features, which had been previously obscured by the literary conservatism of Anglo-Saxon writing, but focuses on Old English phonology. It argues that this contains features strikingly similar to Old Irish (particularly regarding the Old English vowel-changes known as 'i-umlaut' and 'breaking'), and that in these respects Old Irish may provide good evidence for the kind of Celtic spoken in south-eastern Roman Britain at the time of the Anglo-Saxon settlements. Thus it argues that Old English does show Celtic influence. On the way, Chapter 2 also argues that a Latin-speaking elite fled southern Britain to the northern and eastern uplands, and that their imperfect adoption of British Celtic there helps to explain the dramatic changes apparent in the medieval Brittonic languages, and to explain why those changes were so similar to the changes Latin underwent as it became the Romance languages. It further suggests that Brittonic and Irish began to diverge only around the first century AD, and accordingly that the language that became Irish only came to Ireland at that time (perhaps due to migrations prompted by the Roman conquest of Britain). In this reading, the rapid changes undergone by Irish around the fifth to sixth centuries also reflected the adoption of the language by speakers of Ireland's former language (which is known to have given Irish some loan-words but is otherwise now lost). Chapter 3, 'The Origin of High German', focuses on the High German consonant shift. It argues that the way the shift manifested in Old Low Franconian in the Rhineland and in Langobardic in Italy is so similar to the manifestation of affrication in Late Spoken Latin in those areas that there must be a causal connection. Thus the chapter argues that the shift reflects Latin-speakers switching to German and carrying features of their own pronunciation over to it. The change then spread to other High German-speaking regions, being simplified and extended in the process. Chapter 4, 'The Origins of Dutch' argues that several developments distinctive to Western Dutch—particularly the dialectally complex frontings of various vowels—also arose from contact with Old French as Dutch expanded into previously Romance-speaking regions. Chapter 5, 'Beginnings', considers the origin of the Germanic languages themselves, addressing how Common Germanic came to emerge from its Indo-European ancestor. Germanic loanwords show that the Finnic languages were heavily influenced by Germanic at an early stage, and Schrijver argues that key developments in the Germanic consonant system arose by Finnic-speakers in the southern Baltic region transferring aspects of their native sound-system to Germanic. Thus Schrijver sees the rhythmic consonant gradation distinctive to the Uralic languages that include Finnic being the underlying cause of the Germanic sound-change described by Verner's law, and even speculates that the first Germanic consonant shift was triggered by native Finnic-speakers' inability to cope with the difference between voiced and voiceless plosives in the language that became Germanic. The chapter also examines how the changes to the low vowels ā, ō and ǣ which marked the divergence of both North Germanic and West Germanic from Common Germanic have surprising parallels in the development of the Saami languages. None of these languages seems likely as the source of these changes to the others. Since Saami is known to have borrowed many words from a language now lost as Saami culture spread northwards into Scandinavia, Schrijver argues that Saami, West Germanic and North Germanic were all affected in similar ways by contact with a language or group of languages which 'shared a peculiar vowel system, whose features were impressed on North and West Germanic as well as Saami' (p. 194).

Oil on canvas, 4.34 x 7.32m, lost during the war. Only as a black-and-white photograph, shortened by about 40cm on the right edge The Proclamation of the German Empire (18 January 1871) is the title of several historical paintings by the German painter Anton von Werner. On 18 January 1871, Anton von Werner was present at the proclamation of the German Empire in Versailles in his capacity as a painter. In the following years, he produced several versions of the imperial proclamation at greater intervals, two of which were shown in prominent places in Berlin. Only a third version was preserved to Otto von Bismarck's last residence, Friedrichsruh, and is now open to the public. It is the most reproduced picture of the Imperial Proclamation. Since the three paintings show strong differences, the images are of great documentary and historical dichotomy. Von Werner obviously adapted them to the wishes of his respective clients. The clothes worn by Bismarck in the first painting do not match with the other two paintings. Bismarck is wearing his white parade uniform in the second and third painting, which places him in the focus of the viewer. In fact, in Versailles, he was wearing a blue gun coat. In addition, he was holding the Order of Pour le Mérite on his white uniform, which he received in 1884. Minister of War Albrecht von Roon, who did not participate in the proclamation of Versailles, was also included in the third version. In the first, second, and third paintings, the Grand Duke of Baden summons the new emperor. The perspective makes it appear that the imperial proclamation was above all a work of the princes and of the military. Von Werner began working on the picture as one of the most active and influential German artists.  First painting, 1877  On this reproduction of the painting, Werner's self- portrait can be seen on the extreme right margin (with a mustache). The Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles. A few days after the imperial proclamation, the victors of the Siege of Paris used it as a hospital (contemporary painting). In 1870, von Werner spent the final phase of the Franco-Prussian War at the headquarters of the Third Army led by Prussian crown prince Frederick William. In January 1871, the latter asked him to travel from Karlsruhe to the \\"Grand Headquarter\\" in the Palace of Versailles to \\"experience something worthy of your brush.\\"Zitat bei Gaethgens: Anton von Werner, die Proklamierung des Deutschen Kaiserreichs; ein Historienbild im Wandel preußischer Politik. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 1990, S. 9. Von Werner was only informed of the Proclamation of the German Empire on 18 January. The crown prince had impressed the design of the Palace of Versailles, which presented itself to visitors as a national site of fame in France, furnished with historical paintings. He wanted something similar for Berlin, but, unlike Napoleon Bonaparte, he had not come to the idea that the imminent ceremony would be designed by the painter for posterity. Napoleon had allowed Jacques- Louis David to stage the furnishing and the appearance of the actors in his imperial crown for a historical painting.Zur Inszenierung Davids siehe Michael Sauer: Bilder im Geschichtsunterricht. Kallmeyer, Seelze-Velber 2000, , S. 113. The Prussian ceremony in the Hall of Mirrors was short and simple. In the elongated gallery stood, on the window side, Prussian and Bavarian soldiers and on the mirror side, their officers, mixed with some other southern German armies. The King, accompanied by German princes and his entourage, crossed the trellis to the middle, where a field altar was erected. There, a Potsdam army chaplain celebrated a worship service, during which the chorus sang \\"Nun danken alle Gott\\" (Now Thank We All Our God). Then, the group went to a flat platform at the end of the gallery, where the princes and William stood in the middle. Bismarck, who stood below surrounded by commanders, read the imperial proclamation. Thereupon, the Grand Duke of Baden issued a \\"Hoch\\" (\\"Hurrah\\") to \\"His Majesty Emperor William\\", which those who were in attendance repeated three times. The ceremony was over, while the calls continued among the troops station in the palace and the park.Beschreibung der Zeremonie bei Gaethgens: Anton von Werner. Die Proklamierung, S. 14–17. During the worship, Werner quickly sketched the main characters in the immediate vicinity of the Emperor. He later portrayed the princes, the representatives of the Hanseatic cities and numerous officers. During the work, an almost friendly relationship with the Crown Prince came about, as well as the personal relations to Federal Chancellor Bismarck and Emperor William. Werner had the problem of representing the trellis that formed the soldiers with the officers to the gallery and the princes grouped around them. The adjoining oil painting by Victor Bachereau-Reverchon (1842-1885) shows the comparatively narrow space, from whose end the flat gallery for the Emperor had already been removed. It was also important to take the picture of the ceiling paintings that glorify Louis XIV as a conqueror of German lands and cities. As early as January 1871, a conceptual design followed, and later a model, which was approved by the Crown Prince.Dazu Gaethgens: Anton von Werner. Die Proklamierung, S. 18, 22; Vorstudie in Öl, 78 × 158 cm, Privatbesitz in Sachsen, verschollen. The picture was commissioned for the Berlin city palace. Werner determined the image format according to a place he had chosen in the \\"White Hall\\", the largest of the château, which was used for public events such as the opening of the Reichstag and the grand court. His visit was the end and highlight of the guided tours through the representative rooms of the castle, where several hundred paying visitors took part every day.E.

When William II had the hall redesigned in 1892, the picture only fitted into a 9.5 x 9.7m gap at the western end of the picture gallery, thus losing its effect. After the transformation of the picture gallery into a gobeling gallery by William II in 1914 and the following years of the Weimar Republic and the period of National Socialism, the painting remained like most \\"parental pictures\\" of the castle, the eyes of the visitors. Werner's headquarters at the castle were burned during the Second World War on 2 February 1945, during an air raid on Berlin.  Second painting, 1882  The great popularity of the painting prompted William I to entrust Werner with the production of the imperial proclamation in the newly erected Hall of Famy of the Prussian Army in Berlin's Zeughaus. There, opposite to the entrance of the Ruler's Hall, two wall paintings of Werner's flanked the figure of the victorious goddess Viktoria von Fritz Schaper. To the left was the coronation of Frederick III as Prussian King in 1701, and on the right was the proclamation of William I as German Emperor in 1871. The dome, painted by Friedrich Geselschap (de), arched above. Werner designed a frontal display showing William on a high platform surrounded by German princes. At the lowest level, Bismarck, whom Werner had emphasised for colour composition with white uniforms, turned to him, Roon, Moltke and other German commanders. In the foreground, cheering officers to the right of the picture could be seen and to the left a larger group of simple soldiers. In the meantime, two allegorical figures held the Emperor's coat of arms. William rejected Werner's design as being unrealistic, especially since Roon had not taken part in the ceremony. He agreed, however, with Bismarck's uniform, which was also inaccurate. \\"You are right, he was wrongly dressed.\\"Dazu Bartmann 1985, S. 114. Because of the smaller width of the picture, Werner had to reduce the size of the painting considerably. Only the princes of seven larger states remained to the figures of William I, the Crown Prince, and the Grand Duke of Baden. Werner even further reduced the group of officers, placing Georg von Kameke, who had now been appointed Minister of War, in the foreground while others came to the rear. The Prussian Army, with Bavaria, were now documented by a hand of the Prussian General Leonhard von Blumenthal with his Bavarian comrade Jakob von Hartmann, emphasised by his high head of hair and light blue uniform.

Werner, however, deliberately portrayed the participants in the imperial proclamation according to the real circumstances of 1882, and thus a decade after the founding of the Empire.Dies wird nur selten zur Kenntnis genommen, wie in: Dietrich Grünewald (Hrsg.): Kunst entdecken. Cornelsen, Berlin 2009, S. 15. The figures were aged by a good ten years and had gained in importance at the same time. The emperor was now more than just a primus inter pares, and Bismarck had received the Order. Thomas W. Gaehtgens thus assigned to this image the function that \\"it is not a description of history, but credentials of the present with the help of a past occurrence.\\"Gaehtgens: Anton von Werner, die Proklamierung des Deutschen Kaiserreichs; ein Historienbild im Wandel preußischer Politik. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 1990, S. 64. Thus, according to William's view, the second painting emerged as a section of the first with a strong emphasis on figures of William before the princes and flags and Bismarck before the commanders and officers. Only a strict Cuirassier on the left in the foreground, represents the simple soldiers, namely Louis Stellmacher of Lychen of the Gardes du Corps regiment (see picture). The wall painting survived the air raids on the Zeughaus in November 1943, but was no longer in its frame after further damage to the building at the end of the war.Siehe die Abbildungen der zerstörten Herrscherhalle bei Regina Müller: Das Berliner Zeughaus. Die Baugeschichte. Brandenburgisches Verlagshaus, Berlin 1994, , S. 146 (Nr. 246, November 1943) und 256 (Nr. 253, 1945).

Otto-von- Bismarck-Stiftung, Friedrichsruh Werner's second painting, like the Hall of Fame, was also a great success. The Hohenzollern family asked Werner enthusiastically to paint another painting of the imperial proclamation to give it to the \\"Iron Chancellor\\" Bismarck for his 70th birthday in 1885. In the brevity of the time, Werner could only satisfy the wish by colouring the black and white model of the Zeughaus. Again the participants had grown older. At the end of March 1885, Werner used a visit to the Grand Duke of Baden in his studio to update his depiction of the painting.Gaehtgens: Anton von Werner, die Proklamierung des Deutschen Kaiserreichs; ein Historienbild im Wandel preußischer Politik. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 1990, S. 65. One exception was Roon, who had died in 1879 and was not present in 1871. William I had insisted on putting him in the painting because of his close relations to Bismarck. Werner painted Roon as if he would have been a participant at the proclamation. He had portrayed him several times on paintings on the Franco- Prussian War. Werner sacrificed Hartmann's hand print with Blumenthal for Roon's Square. Both moved so closely together that now Hartmann's turn to Blumenthal appears unmotivated.  Fourth painting, 1913  In 1913, Werner created a barely reproduced fourth painting of the Imperial Proclamation as a wall painting for the new building at the Realgymnasium School in Frankurt (Oder) (wax paints on canvas, 4.90 x 7.50m). The appearance of this painting was not passed on. In the Second World War it remained undamaged, but was lost after 1945.Bartmann: Anton von Werner.

The first XV currently plays in Midlands 1 West having been promoted as champions from Midlands 2 West (South) at the end of the 2017-18 season. History Droitwich Rugby Football Club was formed in 1972. The club's first games were played at St. Peter's Field, before moving to the nearby village of Hanbury on the outskirts of Droitwich Spa, where home games took place on land behind the Vernon Arms pub. A change in the pub ownership facilitated another move, this time back into Droitwich Spa, to the King George V playing fields. In 1984, after a number of years ground-hopping, the club official opened its first proper home at Hanbury Road. The 1986-87 season would see league rugby union introduced in England for the first time with Droitwich placed in the Midlands regional leagues. That year Droitwich came close to their first taste of major silverware when they reached the final of the North Midlands Cup, losing to Old Dixonians at The Reddings. In 1990 the club introduced its junior and mini section and this would grow steadily over the coming decade. The town of Droitwich Spa would also grow over the 1990s and this would see developers start to eye the surrounding land for potential development. This development included the ground at Hanbury Road and by 1998 the club decided to sell it off for £1.9 million. With the club's future looking bright thanks to this money, Droitwich moved to their current home - the Glyn Mitchell Memorial Ground (named after one of the club's founders) - which was just up the road from their previous ground.

In Ancient Israel, the First-fruits () or Bikkurim () were a type of offering that were akin to, but distinct from, terumah gedolah. While terumah gedolah was an agricultural tithe, the First- fruits, discussed in the Bikkurim tractate of the Talmud, were a sacrificial gift brought up to the altar (Bikkurim 3:12). The major obligation to bring First Fruits (henceforth Bikkurim) to the Temple began at the festival of Shavuot and continued until the festival of Sukkot (Bikkurim 1:6). This tithe was limited to the traditional seven agricultural products (wheat, barley, grapes in the form of wine, figs, pomegranates, olives in the form of oil, and dates) grown in Israel.Singer, Isidore, ed. (1901) Jewish Encyclopedia (Funk and Wagnals) ASIN: B000B68W5S s.v. \\"Heave-Offering\\" This tithe, and the associated festival of Shavuot, is legislated by the Torah.Exodus ; Leviticus ; Deuteronomy ; et al. Textual critics speculate that these regulations were imposed long after the offerings and festival had developed.Friedman, Richard Elliott (1997), Who Wrote the Bible? HarperOne. By the time of classical antiquity, extensive regulations regarding Bikkurim were recorded in the classical rabbinical literature.Black, Matthew, ed. (2001), Peake's commentary on the Bible, Routledge According to Jewish law, the corners of fields, wild areas, left-overs after harvesting (gleanings), and unowned crops were not subjected to (and could not be used as) the tithe of First Fruits (they were intended to be left as charity for the poor, and other mendicants); plants from outside Israel were also prohibited from inclusion in the tithe, as was anything belonging to non-Jews.Singer, ed., Jewish Encyclopedia, s.v. \\"Sacrifice\\" The rules also specify that each type of product had to be individually tithed, even if the numbers were balanced so that there was no difference in amount between this situation and using just some types of First Fruit as the tithe, and retaining others in their entirety. Fruit which was allocated to the tithe could not be swapped for fruit which wasn't, to the extent that wine couldn't be swapped for vinegar, and olive oil couldn't be replaced by olives; furthermore, fruits were not allowed to be individually divided if only part went to the tithe (small whole pomegranates had to be used rather than sections from a large pomegranate, for example). The separation of tithed produce from untithed produce was also subject to regulation. The individual(s) separating one from the other had to be ritually clean, and had to include the best produce in the tithe if a kohen (priest) lived nearby. During the act of separation, the produce was not permitted to be counted out to determine which fell under the tithe, nor to be weighed for that purpose, nor to be measured for the same reason, but instead the proportion that was to become the tithe had to be guessed at. In certain situations, such as when tithed produce became mixed with non-tithed produce (or there was uncertainty as to whether it had), the tithed produce had to be destroyed. Anyone who made mistakes in the separation of tithed produce, and anyone who consumed any of the tithe, was required to pay compensation as a guilt offering. The pilgrims that brought the Bikkurim to the Temple were obligated to recite a declaration, also known as the Avowal, set forth in Deuteronomy 26:3-10 (cf. Mishnah, Bikkurim 3:6). Native-born Israelites and proselytes would bring the Bikkurim and would say the Avowal, but women who brought the Bikkurim were not permitted to say the Avowal, since they were unable to claim inheritance in the Land bequeathed unto the tribes by their male lineage. This Avowal was incorporated into a beautiful and grand festive celebration with a procession of pilgrims marching up to Jerusalem and then the Temple with gold, silver or willow baskets to which live doves were tied. (Bikkurim 3:3,5 and 8). The pilgrims were led by flutists to the city of Jerusalem where they were greeted by dignitaries (Bikkurim 3:3). The procession would then resume with the flutist in lead until the Temple Mount where the Levites would break out in song (Bikkurim 3:4). The doves were given as sacrificial offerings and the declaration would be made before a priest while the basket was still on the pilgrim's shoulder (Bikkurim 3:5-6). After the basket was presented to the priest, it was placed by the Altar and the pilgrim would bow and leave (Bikkurim 3:6). A prerequisite for bringing the Bikkurim is that the person who brings them is the legal property owner of the land on which the fruits were grown, for which reason, share-croppers and usurping occupants were not permitted to bring them.Mishnah, Bikkurim 1:2 Ceremonial ritual Offering of the first fruits, illustration from a Bible card The following was the method of selecting fruits for the offering: Upon visiting his field and seeing a fig, or a grape, or a pomegranate that was ripe, the owner would tie a cord of reed-grass or similar fiber around the fruit, saying, \\"This shall be among the bikkurim.\\" According to Simeon, he had to repeat the express designation after the fruit had been plucked from the tree in the orchard (Mishnah, Bikkurim 3:1). The fruits were carried in great state to Jerusalem. Stations (Heb. ma'amadot), with deputations representing the people of all the cities in the district, assembled in the chief town of the district, and stayed there overnight in the open squares, without going into the houses. At dawn the officer in charge (Heb. memunneh) called out: \\"Arise, let us ascend to Zion, the house of the Lord our God.\\" Those from the neighborhood brought fresh figs and grapes, those from a distance dried figs and raisins. The bull destined for the sacrifice, his horns gilded and his head wreathed with olive-leaves, led the procession, which was accompanied with flute-playing. When they arrived near the Holy City, the pilgrims sent messengers ahead while they decorated the Firstfruits. The Temple officers came out to meet them, and all artisans along the streets rose before them, giving them the salutation of peace, and hailing them as brothers from this or that town. The flute kept sounding until they reached the Temple mount. Here even King Agrippa, following the custom, took his basket on his shoulder, and marched in the ranks, until they came to the outer court and hall. There they were welcomed by the Levites, singing Psalm 30:2. The doves which had been carried along in the baskets were offered for burnt offerings, and what the men had in their hands they gave to the priests. But before this, while still carrying his basket, each man recited Deuteronomy 26:3 et seq.; at the words \\"an oppressed Aramæan was my father,\\"Typically translated in many English texts, \\"a wayfaring Aramæan was my father,\\" but explained in the Aramaic Targum to mean \\"an oppressed Aramaean was my father.\\" the basket was deposed from the shoulder, but while the owner was still holding its handles or rims, a priest put his hand under it and \\"swung it\\" (lifted it up), and repeated the words \\"an oppressed Aramæan was my father,\\" etc., to the close of the Deuteronomic section. Then placing the basket by the side of the altar, the pilgrim bowed down and left the hall.

ROOL RNAs are found in a variety of bacterial species and apparently do not code for proteins. The RNA has a complex RNA secondary structure and its average size of 581 nucleotides is unusually large for bacterial non-coding RNAs. This large size and structural complexity for a bacterial RNA is consistent with properties of large ribozymes. ROOL RNAs are present in prophages and purified phages, but also in bacterial genomic locations that do not appear to be related to phages. ROOL RNAs are also frequently located nearby to tRNAs. The large size and complicated secondary structure of ROOL RNAs, combined with their association with tRNAs and phages are properties that are shared by the GOLLD RNA motif, another bacterial non-coding RNA. These shared properties could suggest a related function, but the commonalities could arise for other reasons. ROOL RNAs are present in bacteria in the phyla Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Tenericutes, in addition to phages and cow rumen metagenomes, as mentioned above. Within the Firmicutes, they are present in a few species of Clostridia and many lactic acid bacteria, especially those in the genus Lactobacillus. ROOL RNAs in Lactobacillus salivarius were independently discovered based on their extremely high rates of expression in Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118 ROOL RNAs in various strains of Lactobacillus salivarius were then studied; there is a very large range in the expression levels of ROOL RNAs in different strains, and some strains do not appear to have these RNAs in their genome. ROOL RNAs in L. salivarius UC118 are so abundant in some growth conditions that in late stationary phase they exceed even 16S ribosomal RNAs. The experimentally determined size for ROOL RNAs in L. salivarius closely matches the size of the proposed RNA structure based on bioinformatics.

There are several factors contributing to the digital divide in Germany, including age, gender, family structure, education, ethnicity, and motivation. With a large market of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in Germany, there are still areas that don't have access to high-speed internet. Internet access in Germany is more available in big cities compared to rural communities. The German government has taken initiative to increase internet access through the rural communities by adding free internet access throughout the communities, as well as, increase internet education in schools.  ICT related to Germany  While, overall, Germany's ICT market is the fourth largest worldwide and the largest in Europe, high-speed internet is hardly seen in its more rural areas. ICT stands for information and communication technologies, and includes any devices and systems utilized in digital technology and communication. That being said, the ICT market involves the buying and selling of these devices and systems. Germany's Its ICT market grew significantly between 2004 and 2014. Revenue from foreign exports in ICT services jumped from $10.2 billion to $25.8 billion. In 2014 alone, revenue from foreign exports in ICT hardware and consumer electronics that were made in Germany reached $37.3 billion. Market researcher, Marketline, predicts a compound annual growth rate of 5.5 percent between 2016 and 2019. While Germany's ICT market is succeeding globally, within the country itself, ICT success is mainly only prevalent in the larger cities.  Potential Solutions  Germany differs from most other countries in that the digital divide cannot be significantly attributed to disparities in infrastructure. Generally, rural areas are placed at a much higher price point for high-speed Internet access as opposed to urban areas. However, the German digital divide is regionally affected by attainable benefits of Internet access. The regional differences are not so much due to geographic barriers, but instead revolve around the different subgroups of the population that make up each region. An assessment made through Wikipedia and Twitter reported that minority and regional languages are underrepresented online. Germans of all ages are using more and more social networks in past years, a strong indicator of a diminishing digital divide. From 2010 to 2013, the percentage of German citizens over the age of 65 using social networks increased from 50 percent to 66 percent.  Effects of the digital divide in Germany  Germany is the leading economic nation in Europe and the second most populous European nation. With several different ICT innovations brought by Germany, the industry continues to expand all around the world. Information access is a vital source for a societies' economic equality, social mobility, political affiliations, economic growth, and the gap between rural areas and urban areas. A digital divide in such a populous nation in inevitable. Economic growth is based on Germany's productive capacity, measured by the difference of gross national product in a year and its previous year. Principle causes of economic growth include a capital stock increase, technological advances, greater quality of literacy, and recently must take environmental sound into account. According to data provided by Deloitte in 2014, Germany in-store retail sales are influenced 30% by digital technologies, and 15% by web-enabled mobile devices. These technological advances expands the connectivity between online and offline shopping and effects the way society is buying their goods. Social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube influence young adults, ages 21–24, to spend more money in store than adults, ages greater than 25. Germany is known to have a moderate level of economic inequality and social mobility. Social mobility in Germany is heading downward, and according Dr. Reinhard Pollak there are four obstacles for upward social mobility. The first is educational upbringing deficits due from parents to their children that impede development in the early years. Another obstacle is the type of school based on low and high social backgrounds of the children and their performance gap between the different classes of the children. The blocking of vocational opportunities on early teens also block upward social mobility. Finally, career paths for adults are minimal due to adequate funding and unclear framework of career opportunities. All of these factors that prevent upward social mobility in Germany hinder proper technological education for children with poor education, and therefore increases the digital divide in Germany. Political affiliation is a reason for people in Germany to use technology. Before the internet there weren't too many sources of information and now off-liners are concerned about new contents on the internet about the, \\"explicit and radical political contents. Federal and State government and Germany university politics are in support for improving internet utilization under academic research and teaching conditions. There are two important measures: (1) The Hochschulbauförderungsgesetz (University Support Act) and the (2) the Hochschulsonderprogramm III (HSPIII) (University Special Plan III). Financial contribution by the states and federal government are due to the goal of bridging the digital divide in Germany. Availability and accessibility of education and technology in rural and peripheral areas in Germany measure to be limited compared to urban areas.

She was a founding member of the Fairbanks Native Association and the Institute of Alaska Native Arts and worked as a lobbyist for the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. She co-founded the Tundra Times newspaper and served as a director of the corporate board for Alaska Airlines for over two decades. She served as co-chair of the Alaska Federation of Natives between 1988 and 1989, the first woman to serve in the capacity, and was the third president and a founding member of the North American Indian Women's Association. Fate has served on various commissions and national studies of issues which affect indigenous people. She was the project manager of a study of women and disability, served as the only indigenous member of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission and was a member of U.S. Census Advisory Committee on indigenous populations. She has received numerous honors and awards for her activism on behalf of Native Americans and was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2014. Early life Mary Jane Evans was born in 1933 in Rampart, in the United States Territory of Alaska, to Sally (née Woods, later Hudson) and Thomas George Evans, Jr. Her father was a trapper and mail carrier. After completing her primary education, Evans attended Mount Edgecumbe Boarding School in Sitka, graduating in 1952. She then went on to study accounting at the University of Alaska and simultaneously worked at Wien Alaska Airlines to pay her way through school. On October 29, 1954, she married Hugh Fate, Jr., who would become a dentist and Native Americans rights activist. The couple had three daughters, Janine, Jennifer and Julie. Their daughter Julie married United States Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska.Who Is Dam Sullivan's Wife? New Details On Julie Fate Sullivan Career After her marriage, Fate returned to work at Wien Alaska Airlines. Fate and her husband were part of the founding members of the Fairbanks Native Association which organized in 1962 and 1963. Around the same time, she became involved in the Tundra Times, the first news organization written by and for Native Alaskans, which served not only to inform the community of important issues throughout the state, but the state's congressional leaders of those issues the indigenous population felt were imperative. Fate was on the executive board of the paper and also served as the secretary to the board for the newspaper. Recognizing the limited educational opportunities for Native Alaskans, Fate became involved in the Fairbanks Native Association's education committee in 1962. She worked on a six-year study of the educational system to evaluate the reasons why education was substandard in Alaska. Fate testified at a state congressional hearing on their findings, showing that the majority of rural students either attended no high school or attended at inadequate facilities located long distances from their homes. The committee pressed for dormitories to be built for student housing in urban areas to enable students from rural areas to attend high schools. She served on the executive committee of the Native Alaskan Village for the Alaska 67 Centennial Exposition and worked on the Hospital Foundation of Fairbanks, before becoming involved in the Alaska Native claims settlement. Provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) for the first time gave indigenous villages both land and capital to invest in education. The settlement awarded 44 million acres of land and $962.5 million to allow Native Alaskans to establish twelve regional corporations to manage the assets. Fate became president of the Rampart Village Corporation, established in 1971 as one of those regional entities and worked to ensure that indigenous people enrolled to share in the settlement. Fate was one of the founders of the North American Indian Women's Association (NAIWA) which formed in 1970 in Fort Collins, Colorado. The organization was the first pan-Indian group of indigenous women to organize with a national platform. In 1975, Fate became the third president of the NAIWA, succeeding Agnes Dill. and served until 1977. Concern over the health of Native Alaskans was also an issue for Fate, and in the 1970s, she both spoke at conferences regarding the problems and with Nancy Murkowski and others founded a Breast Cancer Detection Center in Fairbanks in 1975. She headed a federal program Special Needs of Handicapped Indian Children and Indian Women's Problems which began in 1977, to collect and collate data concerning child abuse, nutrition, physical and mental handicaps, rape, single parenting, and violence towards women. In addition, the program evaluated social service availability to deal with these types of issues, including assessment of the facilities and qualifications required for caregivers. In 1978, she participated in the national conference of Rural American Women Inc., held in Washington, D. C. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss problems faced by women, but specifically those, like isolation and lack of services, that compounded issues for women not living in urban centers. In 1981 Fate was appointed to serve on the Alaska Judicial Council and served until 1987. She was elected as co-chair with Henry Ivanoff of the Alaska Federation of Natives between 1988 and 1989 and was the first woman to hold the post. In 1990, she was named to the Alaska Natives Commission and two years later was elected co-chair of the commission with Perry Eaton. The goal of the commission, part of the joint Federal-State Commission on Policies and Programs Effecting Alaska Natives, was to complete a two-year study and make recommendations for a strategic plan for governmental interaction with native populations. In 1991, Fate served on the transition team for governor-elect Wally Hickel and in 1993, was named to serve on the Board of Regents for the University of Alaska. In 1998, Fate received the national Cancer Awareness Award from the Congressional Families Action for Cancer Awareness for her work in health care. She was named by President George H.W. Bush to serve on the United States Arctic Research Commission in 2001. The commission's purpose, was to establish national scientific research policy for the Arctic region, which was sensitive to residents and natural resources. Fate was the only Native American who served on the commission during her term which lasted until 2006. In 2003, she was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve on the U.S. Census Advisory Committee on American Indian and Alaska Native Populations. In 2012 Fate was honored by the Alaska Federation of Natives with two President's Awards, receiving both the Public Service Award and the Citizen of the Year Award, the highest honor the board bestows. She was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2014.

A player under contract to a team is placed on \\"waivers\\" for a specified period of time; during this time other teams may submit a claim for that player's contract. Based on a priority system, the team with the highest priority earns either the right to negotiate with the player's current team, or in some cases, the right to assume the contract of that player from the current team. Each of the four major league sports has somewhat different procedures for handling waivers. The purpose of waivers is to prevent teams from colluding to exchange players outside of the normal trade rules, as well as to encourage parity by giving lower-ranked teams the right of first refusal to claim players who are no longer wanted by their former club.  Major League Baseball  Players may be placed on waivers at any time. Teams may claim any waived player during the first three days after being placed on waivers. If more than one team claims the player during the three-day window, the team with the lowest win percentage has first priority. Once a player is claimed, the player's current team may either negotiate a trade, rescind the waiver, or do nothing and allow the claiming team to assume the player's contract. Any player that remains unclaimed (or whose waiver offer is not rescinded) after three days, the player may be sent outright (\\"outrighted\\") to a club's minor league baseball affiliate or, if the player has already been outrighted to the minors once before in his career, granted unrestricted free agency to sign with any club.  National Football League  Players in the National Football League may be placed on waivers at any point between July 4 to February 1. Between July 4 and the end of the regular season, the waiver window is 24 hours. Between the end of the regular season and February 1 the waiver window is three days. If more than one team claims the player during the waiver window, the team with the lowest win percentage has first priority. Once another team claims a player on waivers, they assume that players contract without the need to negotiate with the player's former club. Any player that clears the waiver window becomes a free agent. Waivers are not possible between February 1 and July 4; players released outside of the season become free agents without having to clear waivers.  National Hockey League  Players in the National Hockey League are placed on waivers following any of several conditions. Firstly, players who meet a certain threshold of league experience (based on a complex formula based on position, age, and time spent in the NHL) cannot be designated for assignment to a minor league club unless first placed on waivers. Secondly, the same players brought back to their parent NHL club from the minors also have to clear waivers. Thirdly, players who spend at least one season playing in another country's major professional hockey league are placed on waivers when returning to the NHL. Fourthly, players who are released from their parent club unconditionally are placed on waivers before they become free agents. Teams have 24 hours (measured from noon Eastern Time following the announcement of the transaction) to place a claim on a player. If more than one team claims the player during the 24-hour window, the team with the lowest win-loss-tie point total has first priority. The claiming team then assumes the contract. If the player clears waivers, the intended transaction (either changing teams or outright release) proceeds.  National Basketball Association  Players in the National Basketball association are placed on waivers if they are released by their parent club during the season. Other teams have 48 hours to claim the waived player. If more than one team claims the player during the two-day window, the team with the lowest win percentage has first priority. The claiming team assumes the player's contract when they claim them, however for players signed off of waivers after March 1, they are ineligible to participate in that season's playoffs. Players who clear waivers become unrestricted free agents. Players released by their parent clubs in the off-season do not have to clear waivers before signing with another club.

Life She was born Marie-Claire-Adine Fafard in L'Islet, about 40 miles east of Quebec City, Canada. Her parents were Louis-Auguste Fafard (who died in a collision in 1897) and Alphonsine Couillard Dupuis. She had six siblings, among whom her brother Fernand would become a member of the House of Commons of Canada. Her musical ability emerged early, and she received her first formal training in music in 1893, winning prizes the following year and again in 1896. In 1903, she married Elzéar N. P. Drolet, a notary. Following her marriage, she used the name Madame E. Drolet for professional appearances until Elzéar's death in 1905. Their son Yvan was born a few months later and died as an infant. After Elzéar's death, Adine adopted Fafard-Drolet as her surname. She died in Lac- Etchemin, Quebec. Musical career By 1903, Fafard-Drolet, a dramatic soprano, was appearing regularly around L'Islet and Quebec City. In 1907 she went to Europe for two years of further training, studying in London at the Royal College of Music and in Paris with the baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure. She gave several concerts in Europe and in one of these sang for King Alfonso XIII of Spain. She auditioned for the composer Jules Massenet and was offered a leading role in his unfinished opera Don Quichotte; however, she declined because of her plan to return to Canada and found a conservatory. Fafard- Drolet returned to Canada in 1909 and gave a series of concerts around Quebec City and L'Islet. In 1910 or 1911, with advice from the organist Ernest Gagnon, she founded a music school, the Conservatoire de Québec (Conservatory of Quebec, referred to informally as the Fafard-Drolet Conservatory). Fafard- Drolet taught there according to what was known as the Marchesi method. The training was free thanks to an annual subsidy from the then-Premier of Quebec, Lomer Gouin, and the course of study was designed to last three years. Students were taught music theory, music history, voice, phonetics, piano, violin, cello, and harmonium; later Gregorian chant was added to the list. The conservatory moved within Quebec City at least six times before closing its doors in 1939 at the onset of World War II. In the early 1920s, Fafard-Drolet also taught singing in secondary schools. In 1928, she was awarded a silver medal by the Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec, Narcisse Pérodeau, for her founding of and work with the conservatory. Honors The city of Quebec has put up a plaque in her honor at 25 Rue Mont-Carmel, where she lived from 1921 to 1923.

The church was built in 1500 and it was enlarged in 1757. It is adjoined by a Franciscan convent. History The Franciscans opened their first friary in Malta in Rabat, having arrived on the islands in 1492. The church was built some years later in 1500. The first Hospitaller Grand Master in Malta, Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, had a room in the friary, and he died there in 1534. The room still exists and it has been restored. The church was enlarged in 1757 with the help of contributions from Italy, Spain and Portugal. It was dedicated on 31 October 1790. Parts of the church and convent were restored in 2003. The church's frescoed interior In the early hours of 23 August 2017, two wooden beams which were supporting part of the church's ceiling gave way, leaving a hole and destroying a fresco. Falling debris damaged the marble altar and some benches and light fittings, but no one was injured since the church was empty at the time. The building was closed for some time, although there was no immediate danger of further collapse. The Bank of Valletta has pledged to help in repairing the damage and restoring the church. A temporary roof was built three weeks after the collapse. Planned permanent repair works initially considered the possibility of building a dome, which was included in the church's original design but was never built, but studies showed that the church's structure was not strong enough to support its weight. The ceiling is to be rebuilt, and the artist Adonai Camilleri Cauchi is to cover a false ceiling under it with new frescoes.

The album comprises remixes of songs from their previous album, They Spent Their Wild Youthful Days in the Glittering World of the Salons, along with soundbites and forays into experimental music. Taang! Records released Strictly East Coast Sneaky Flute Music in 1998 on CD, and also re-packaged most of it as the first disc of a double LP. with the bulk of Salons as the second. Background Swirlies released their first dance remix following their first LP in 1993 and soon began incorporating more electronic instruments into their live set and in composing their next album. As band members' academic pursuits fueled line-up changes, the group found themselves drummerless for a spell and adopted a drum machine to fill out its rhythm section. Remaining guitarist Damon Tutunjian and bassist Andy Bernick took this as an opportunity to explore further possibilities for collaboration, and so invited several East Coast electronica artists to remix their songs. Guest DJs included Swirlies producer Rich Costey, trip-hop artist DJ Spooky, and Swirlies then-new drummer Adam Pierce from American shoegaze outfit Mice Parade. Songs About half of the album's tracks are DJ remixes of previously released Swirlies songs. The others are experiments by individual band members, archival practice recordings of the band jamming, or field recordings like those that appear on other Swirlies records. The compact disc version of the album closes with a hidden track of Swirlies covering the song \\"Glue\\" by 1980s Boston hardcore punk band S.S. Decontrol. Performed live at a music festival, the song was a mainstay for Swirles' original line up, harkening back to the members' punk rock roots.

This is a working and middle-class neighborhood northeast of the campus of Coe College. It includes single-family dwellings, a church, and a school. The buildings are representative of various architectural styles and vernacular building forms popular from c. 1875 to 1963. The oldest house was built in 1873 and moved here in the early 20th century. Bungalow, Craftsman, and American Foursquare houses are dominant. A simple side-tower church, originally Central Park Presbyterian Church, was built in 1904. For the most part, architect-designed buildings are a rarity here.

It was designed and part-owned by the architect Harry Weston, and was the second of eight cinemas that he is known to have designed. He had previously designed the Plaza Cinema in Worthing (1933)Plaza Cinema, Worthing, Cinema Treasures Guide. and went on to design another six cinemas during the 1930s, mostly for the Gaumont British Picture Corporation. It was known as a 'Super Cinema' as it also incorporated theatre, staging live variety shows and orchestral/organ performances. The Managing Directors, Charles A. Sinden and Mr P. Lyons, as well as the Secretary of 'Embassy (Chadwell Heath) Ltd.', Mr R. Teppett, were instrumental in the creation of the cinema. 'A Short Story about The Embassy', a history of the cinema produced by Lyons, was one of the first films to be shown on the opening night.\\"Embassy Cinema. Mayor Performs the Opening Ceremony.\\", The Ilford Recorder, 24 May 1934, Page 9 The programme was continued with a Mickey Mouse Disney cartoon, 'Fury of the Jungle' featuring Donald Cook and Peggy Shannon, and Constance Cummings in Broadway Through a Keyhole.\\"Embassy Cinema - Advertisement\\", The Ilford Recorder, 17 May 1934, Page 3 Five months after the Embassy Cinema opened, it was taken over by Provincial Cinematograph Theatres (PCT) as part of the Gaumont chain, and operated as the 'Gaumont Palace Theatre' from October 1934. It ran throughout the Second World War and was never sub-divided. The Gaumont Palace Theatre was re-named 'Gaumont Theatre', from 1937, and continued under Gaumont British management. After the Second World War, Picture Palaces all over Britain began free entertainment for children. This was known as 'The Saturday Morning Picture Club'. A published extract from the memories of a local resident of Chadwell Heath, Patricia Duyshart, described the frivolities in depth: > \\"The Gaumont Cinema in Chadwell Heath issued all children with free passes > that were shown on entry. Long before opening time, huge crowds of > squabbling children were queuing up outside the cinema, all of them trying > to push in the line...When the doors at last opened, there was the biggest > rush you ever saw...\\" In February 1964, the Gaumont Theatre was taken over by the Rank Organisation and re-named the Odeon Chadwell Heath. However, it ultimately closed as a cinema on 28 July 1966 with James Garner in Duel at Diablo and Bob Hope in 'Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number' as the final screenings. = Bingo Hall, 1966–2014 = Within hours of the closing of the doors, to the Odeon Chadwell Heath, workmen moved in to convert the cinema into a Bingo Hall.\\"Cinema man turns to bingo\\", Barking and Dagenham Post, 03 August 1966, Page 1 The auditorium was completely redecorated, and the foyer was transformed into a buffet.\\"New Bingo Hall Opens Tomorrow\\", Barking and Dagenham Post, 17 August 1966, Page 11 The projectors and Compton organ were sold, and the large screen was removed. It was to be open for seven days a week with two matinees on Mondays and Thursdays. The Bingo hall was the fifty-second ever Rank club, but the first Rank hall in the area – the premises was re-named as 'The Top Rank Club'.\\"Full house as another cinema switches to bingo\\", The Ilford Recorder, 25 August 1966, Page 6 The opening night was hosted by Tommy Trinder (CBE).\\"So much fun – so much to be WON playing BINGO at the Top Rank Club\\", Barking and Dagenham Post; 03 August 1966, Page 2\\"New look bingo\\", The Romford Times, 26 August 1966, Page 10 Top Rank's area manager stated: \\"We decided to go over to bingo in June, because there are already plenty of cinemas – in Whalebone Lane and Romford – but very few bingo halls in this part of London.\\" The hall was equipped with a closed-circuit television and direct contact via teleprinters, to enable the bingo players to compete with Top Rank Club members in the 52 other halls all over Britain. Decades later, the club began operating as a Mecca Bingo. The hall closed on 15 June 2014. More than 400 people attended the final night of bingo. Falling membership meant that the owners, Rank Plc, believe it financially viable to renew the lease. The smoking ban in England, as well as the Great Recession, had been the main factors in the loss of members. =Banqueting Suite, 2015-present= After a short vacant period, the premises was acquired by Vinod Nagrecha and Hasmukh NagrechaNagrecha Brothers Limited, Mecca Bingo Club, High Road, Chadwell Heath, RM6 4BD and a lease was granted to Wazid Hassan (Shelim)IMMA Limited, High Road, Chadwell Heath, RM6 4BD to create a venue for weddings and other functions. The refurbishment process lasted for nine months, and the building re-opened as the current Mayfair Venue in December 2015.

Architecture Embassy Cinema, foyer (1934) Embassy Cinema, auditorium (1934) Harry Weston designed the Embassy Cinema in a more lavish style than would have been usual for a Gaumont Cinema. Its façade had a Modernist horizontal emphasis, faced in cream/'biscuit' coloured faience tiling above and black faience tiles below, with chromium plated fittings, enhanced by neon strip lighting and illuminated signs at night. There is a large window over the entrance which allows light into the ballroom. The double-height entrance foyer behind featured Art Deco metalwork and a floodlit glass column of crystalline rods. The auditorium originally had a ‘saucered’ floor to improve sight-lines from the seats. The splay walls featured horizontal fins which extended across decorative panels and grillwork, leading towards the proscenium arch which was backlit from the rim. Many of these features have survived, and show how Weston carried his Art Deco/streamline moderne style throughout all of his cinema’s spaces and details.The Embassy Cinema - Report to London Borough of Redbridge, Cinema Theatre Association, Architectural Caseworker's Report, Peter Wylde, 2017  Features  The Embassy Cinema encompassed a number of innovative ideas, some of which were unknown in the cinema world at the time.\\"The Embassy Opened. New Super Cinema at Chadwell Heath\\", The Dagenham Post, 25 May 1934, Page 4 It featured a tea-lounge and artistic café, as well as a ballroom for dancing to the sound of a live orchestra. A 24-foot deep stage and orchestra pit, in the auditorium, could accommodate live performances as there were also four adjacent dressing rooms. The large screen was controlled by a mechanism, that could make it move backwards and forwards. When a picture was showing it was lowered towards the audience, thereby minimising eye-strain.\\"Mayor to Open a Luxury Cinema, Last Word in Beauty and Comfort, Chadwell Enterprise\\", The Ilford Recorder, 17 May 1934, Page 9 The latest system of Western Electric wide-range apparatus provided rich sound quality and substantially high production value; Sinden and Lyons wanted to ensure that hearing would be perfect from every seat in the house. Concealed lighting was fitted throughout the building, and controlled from the roof, to achieve special, flat skylight effects. To lower the levels of humidity, the air, to the amount of two million cubic feet per hour, was drawn into a purifying chamber by huge, electric fans. It was then filtered, washed, heated and cooled by means of this inventive ventilation system; thus ensuring equable temperature in all seasons. The projector room was large enough to contain three to five projectors, and lighting control boxes for the stage, balcony and auditorium (manufactured by 'Major Equipment Co. Ltd' of Westminster). The auditorium housed a Compton 3-manual/8-rank organ. The glass console of the organ had a unique green colour scheme, and the special illumination was an idea introduced by Lyons; an innovation that he perfected years earlier, and one of the first of its kind in Britain. The decoration scheme followed lines of effective simplicity, with the dominating colour of the wall being old gold.\\"Cinema Uplift, Mayor Hopes That American Slang Will Go\\", The Romford Times, 23 May 1934, Page 3 The seats were of the tip-up variety, upholstered in green velvet. The carpets were green and beige, whilst the curtains, hangings (and even the uniforms of the ushers and attendants) also embodied the same colour scheme.

It is one of the best known Norwegian paintings. Gude painted the landscapes and Tidemand the bridal party. The painting is 93 x 130 cm, and is in the National Gallery in Oslo. It is considered to be an excellent example of romantic nationalism in Norway. In the painting, a bridal procession crosses a fjord in boats, after the wedding. The groom, tipping his hat, and the bride, in her bridal crown, can be seen in the first boat. The boat crew are dressed in typical Bunad costumes. In the distance, other boats with guests of the wedding can be seen. The scene, Gude later wrote, was not as viewed from a particular location, but was deliberately composed from his overall observations. The painting was first presented in a tableau vivant at the Christiania Theater in 1849. The soirée, in March 1849, included a theatrical group dressed in traditional costumes aboard a boat who performed a song by Andreas Munch with music by Halfdan Kjerulf, with the painting itself serving as scenery.

Waring was the son of Robert Waring of Owlbury, Shropshire. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and was admitted at St. John’s College, Cambridge on 8 April 1745, aged 18. In 1755 Waring was returned as Member of Parliament for Bishops Castle through his residence at Owlbury. He is not known to have voted or made any speech during this Parliament. He married Hannah Ranby, daughter of John Ranby, serjeant surgeon to King George II on 18 July 1758. In 1759, he vacated his seat and arranged for Henry Grenville to take his place, in order, it seems, to raise money. Subsequently, his father in law encouraged him to stand at Bishops Castle again in 1763. Lord Clive offered to pay his expenses if he stood down as he was bound to lose, and in due course he did lose to Clive’s nephew. In 1768 Waring unsuccessfully contested Coventry. He inherited the estate at Groton, Suffolk from his cousin Thomas Waring in 1769. The estate was considerable, and in 1773 he was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Coventry. He contested Coventry successfully in the 1774 British general election but appears to have made little or no contribution in parliament. Waring died at the beginning of February 1780 and was buried at Groton.

He is known for his television roles playing Joe Chernak and Stacey Grainger in Peyton Place and The Virginian. Quine also was the president of the Professional Karate Association (PKA) whose Kick of the 80’s weekly fight series on ESPN ran for close to a decade. He wrote American Karate, a book on self-defense. Early life Quine was born on September 11, 1938, in Fennville, Michigan, to Irene Elizabeth Quine (1916-2008) and Robert Corkill Quine (1895-1943). After Don’s father, a medical surgeon and major in the U.S. Air Force, was tragically killed in the crash of a B-24 Liberator bomber near Gunnison, Colorado, on July 19, 1943, his mother entrusted Don and his younger sister, Janis, into the care of Alec Dahlke, a carpenter, and his wife Evelyn, a schoolteacher, in Oxnard, California. Their daughters, Phyllis and Patty babysat the two siblings, giving Don's mother the opportunity to continue working as a dental assistant while staying at the home of a friend to save up money for a place to live with her two children. Several years later, Don’s mother remarried, and he and his sister moved to northern California with their stepfather, James Gores, who was a steeplejack. Don was valedictorian of his sixth grade class at Santa Fe Elementary in Oakland, California, a sergeant in the school Traffic Patrol and had two paper routes as a delivery boy for The Oakland Tribune. Don bought the first TV set in his neighborhood, a 10\\" RCA, and charged kids a nickel a peek to watch Howdy Doody and Lone Ranger, until his stepfather put an end to the operation and explained to Don that capitalism has its limits. His teenage years were troubled and Don spent several months at a juvenile detention center in Martinez, California, for burglary. After his mother divorced Gores and married an officer in the Coast Guard, Nathan Vanger, Don moved to Staten Island and graduated from New Dorp High School in 1957. Acting career After a semester of pre-medical studies at the University of Colorado, Don realized he did not want to be a doctor. While at Wagner College back in Staten Island, Don became involved in the Theatre Arts program. This led him to New York City where he studied at the American Theatre Wing with Stella Adler and John Stix, before landing the role of Tom Stark in Robert Penn Warren’s Off-Broadway premiere of All the King’s Men at the East 74th Street Theatre in 1959. It was here that he was spotted by an agent and offered work in Hollywood.

Mostyn and his wife also founded the Glenda Jean Mostyn and Joe E Moreno Educational Foundation, a charity to assist children with special needs.http://www.mostynmoreno.org Born in Perth, Western Australia, Mostyn grew up in a small town in East Texas called Whitehouse. He attended the South Texas College of Law and graduated in 1996. A few years after law school, Mostyn became a partner at a law firm in Houston. Unsatisfied with his position, he chose to create a \\"uniquely different Texas law firm.\\" That law firm was Mostyn Law, the name it still carries today. From the beginning of his launch of his law firm, Mostyn focused on representing clients who had been allegedly wronged by corporate negligence and wrongdoing. He took clients from across the country, not just in Texas.  Legal career  Mostyn's career has focused on mass tort litigation, including hurricane lawsuits and hailstorm lawsuits. Mostyn is \\"a top Democratic donor who has made a fortune suing insurance companies on behalf of homeowners after hurricanes\\" according to The Texas Tribune. According to Texas Lawyer, Mostyn \\"made a name for himself representing victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy.\\" When Hurricane Rita hit Texas in 2005, Mostyn and his firm took the cases of homeowners who wanted to file lawsuits against their insurance companies on the belief that the insurance companies had underpaid the homeowners for hurricane damages. Steve filed 1,200 claims from this hurricane. According to Capital Research, \\"His strategy was to flood the zone, filing such a torrent of cases that insurance companies would be overwhelmed and decide to settle instead of litigate.\\" After Hurricane Ike in 2008, Mostyn made hundreds of millions of dollars filing lawsuits against insurance companies. He essentially created a \\"model\\" for getting victims of weather events to sue insurance companies. During a Texas House committee hearing in 2017 about HB 1774, a weather lawsuit reform bill, \\"the committee expressed concerns that the Ike model was now used for all major Texas weather events.\\" In February 2017, Mostyn brought three hail lawsuits in Potter County, Texas, against State Farm Lloyds. Mostyn lost all three cases. Beginning in 2012, Steve filed mass litigation following hailstorms in Hidalgo County. As a result, the Texas state legislature considered passing a bill to end \\"the apparent abuse\\" of mass litigation. =HB 1774 and hail lawsuit hustling= HB 1774 is a Texas state bill signed into law \\"aimed at ending weather-related lawsuit abuse\\" that took effect on September 1, 2017. Immediately before HB 1774 took effect, Mostyn used social media and the news to encourage homeowners to file claims for Hurricane Harvey before September 1. In a March 2017 hearing about HB 1774 before the Texas House Insurance Committee, one of Mostyn's lawyers testified to legislators that \\"nobody, even her law firm, likes storm-chasing attorneys.\\" Only weeks prior, however, Mostyn's firm set up a booth with the Abagados Manuel Solis immigration law firm at a San Antonio flea market \\"hustling for clients\\" for hail lawsuits. The SE Texas Record obtained photos of the booth with fliers that read, \\"WARNING: Affected by Hail? If you filed a claim and it was not enough, if you never made a claim … Do not settle for it! We could possibly help you! Trust the one who knows how to win!\\"https://jnswire.s3.amazonaws.com/jns-media/b5/67/535613/handout.pdf  Political contributions and advocacy  Mostyn has been politically active in terms of financing both candidates and political action committees that are focused on opposing lawsuit reform. A few of the organizations that Mostyn has funded and supported include the following: * Back to Basics PAC: Mostyn created this committee in 2010 to oppose the election of then-Gov. Rick Perry and other political leaders and candidates who supported lawsuit reform. The committee has spent over $4.5 million. Mostyn contributed $3,935,181 in 2010, and contributed $377,060 in 2012. * Conservative Voters of Texas: According to the website The Truth About Steve Mostyn, \\"Despite its conservative sounding name, this multi-million-dollar pack was founded by Mostyn associate Mark McCraig in the last election cycle to attack pro-tort reform legislators and candidates.\\" For the 2012 cycle, Mostyn contributed $5.2 million to Super PACs. The majority of the contributions went ($3 million) went to Priorities USA Action (pro-Barack Obama). Mostyn has given campaign contributions directly to political candidates and through a web of political action committees and other groups, which in turn give the money to the candidates themselves.http://www.thetruthaboutstevemostyn.com/sites/thetruthaboutstevemostyn.com/themes/mostyn/images/spider.jpg Mostyn and his wife, attorney Amber Mostyn, believe that there is too much money in politics. They opposed the Supreme Court's Citizens United case and supported campaign finance reform. Steve and Amber Mostyn contributed $3 million into the Texas gubernatorial campaign of Democrat Wendy Davis, who lost the election. They were also co-founders of the Ready for Hillary PAC, a political action committee supporting Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. In 2014, Mostyn, who usually contributes to Democratic candidates, gave a large contribution to a police-affiliated political action committee that was donating money to Republican primary candidates. Mostyn wanted to defeat Tea Party-affiliated freshman Congressman Matt Schaefer, a Republican from Tyler, Texas. When asked, Mostyn's spokesman said Mostyn was interested in the race because he is from Tyler.

Life In 1909, aged 17, he joined Beckett's Bank (which was taken over by The Westminster Bank in 1921). A year after World War One broke out, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). After a few months he found a talent for entertaining other soldiers as a pierrot with the 13th Corps Concert Party and did this for the rest of the war in up to 300 events. After the war was over, he returned to the bank in Bradford and continued as a compere and comedian. In 1935 he joined the Bradford Civic Theatre where he performed in many productions, usually in comic roles. Many were plays by JB Priestley, man of letters, lifelong friend and the most celebrated Bradfordian of that generation. He also took up painting, mainly in watercolours. He studied at the Bradford School of Art and joined Bradford Arts Club where he remained a member for over 60 years, serving later as vice-chairman, chairman and president. He painted predominantly town and country scenes around Bradford, the Brontë Country and the Yorkshire Dales, particularly Wharfedale and Airedale. He exhibited widely throughout Yorkshire and also at the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours (the RI). He was a regular contributor for the Dalesman magazine. After retirement he was able to devote all his time to painting for the rest of his life. He was very prolific and his work was widely respected by peers and the general public. Bradford Civic Theatre Concert Party at the Hippodrome As well as his friendship with JB Priestley, he had many friends connected with the worlds of both art and the theatre in Bradford and the wider West Riding. He was also a passionate supporter of Bradford City AFC, having been born within a mile of Valley Parade and even trialled for the club as a teenager. When growing up in the Toller Lane area both he and JB Priestley regularly played football together (Toller Lane Tykes and Saltburn United). A photograph of Percy was published in the Sunday Times on the 19 May 1985 showing him pay his final visit to Valley Parade the day after the tragedy of the Bradford City Fire on 11 May 1985 when 56 people lost their lives and 250 suffered injuries. In March 2018, Percy's grandson, Martin Greenwood, published a comprehensive biography about Monkman entitled Percy Monkman: An Extraordinary Bradfordian. Whilst researching the book, Greenwood was hospitalised after breathing in spores from his grandfathers 100-year old documents. See also Monkman surname.

Painted in 1886, it currently hangs in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri.  Background  After the scandal caused by Sargent’s Portrait of Madame X at the Paris Salon of 1884, the artist lost much of his French clientele and relocated to England in 1886 in search of new commissions. Sargent’s Portrait of Mrs. Cecil Wade was his first major project after the 1884 Salon and formally retreats from many of the controversial aspects of Madame X. Mrs. Cecil Wade (née Frances Mackay Frew; June 17, 1863 – December 30, 1908) was born in Glasgow, Scotland, and married London stockbroker Cecil Lowry Wade (1857 – 1908) in 1883. She was 23 years old when she sat for Sargent in her London home, wearing the white satin gown she wore to be presented before Queen Victoria.Henry Adams, Handbook of American Paintings in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (Kansas City, Mo.: Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, 1991), 40-43. Portrait of Madame X (Madame Pierre Gautreau), John Singer Sargent, 1884 Description Portrait of Mrs. Cecil Wade shows Sargent's virtuosity in painting both portraits and interiors, as well as his willingness to boldly experiment with light and darkness. The painting features a full-length rendering of Mrs. Wade in profile glancing to her right, her body portrayed at a sight angle, with a bright light washing over her fair skin and white satin dress. She sits on a wooden bench upholstered with a red floral cushion, and is adorned with sparkling bracelets and a choker in addition to a white fan. In the dimly lit background, midday light trickles in through a window covered by a yellow curtain and illuminates a small table and chair with a plant nearby.  Exhibition History  Portrait of Mrs. Cecil Wade was exhibited once during Sargent’s life, in 1887 at an exhibition of artists calling themselves the New English Art Club at the Dudley Gallery in London.Exhibition of Pictures and Sculpture of the New English Art Club, 1887, New English Art Club, Dudley Gallery, London, April 4–May 1887, no. 55 (as Portrait of a Lady).

After its acquisition by the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in 1986, Portrait of Mrs. Cecil Wade was featured in three additional special exhibitions. The first was an exhibition of selected new acquisitions at the Nelson-Atkins Museum in 1987, in which it received special distinction amongst the other highlighted works.A Bountiful Decade: Selected Acquisitions, 1977–1987 , Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Mo., October 14–December 6, 1987, no. 76.

Most recently, Portrait of Mrs. Cecil Wade was included in a 1997 exhibition featuring paintings from Sargent’s early career at the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, MA.Uncanny Spectacle: The Public Career of the Young John Singer Sargent, Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, Mass., June 15–September 7, 1997, no. 33.  Provenance  After the 1908 death of the sitter, Francis Frew Wade (who had owned and kept the painting in London since 1886), the piece passed into the ownership of her daughter, Aileen Wade, who remained living in London. Aileen Wade bequeathed the painting to her nephew, Sir Ruthven L. Wade, and he received the work in 1955. It was under his ownership in Dinton, England until 1986, when it was auctioned at Sotheby’s New York and bought by the Enid and Crosby Kemper Foundation in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1986, Enid and Crosby Kemper gifted the painting to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, where it currently hangs prominently in the Sarah and Landon Rowland American art galleries. Critical Reception At its debut in the New English Art Club exhibition in 1887, Portrait of Mrs. Cecil Wade was given very mixed reviews. F.D. Maurice and Charles Kingsley from The Spectator extolled the \\"individuality and life in the face of the sitter,\\" while also chastising its \\"forced\\" use of light in the foreground and \\"cold\\" manner in which the painting was executed, resulting in \\"no hint of tenderness, no suspicion of poetry\\" in the work at large.\\"Art: The New English Art Club,\\" Spectator (London) 60 (April 16, 1887), 527. Furthermore, while the Saturday Review (London) praised Sargent, who \\"[sent] a brilliant and admirably handled likeness of a lady in white (cat. no. 55) against a charmingly painted interior,\\"\\"Picture Galleries,\\" Saturday Review (London), April 9, 1887, 515. the Illustrated London News noted once more Sargent's disregard for the personhood of Mrs. Wade, stating that \\"Mr. Sargent's 'Portrait of a Lady' (cat. no. 55) in white satin suggests that her arms and face were made of cardboard\\".\\"Art Exhibitions,\\" Illustrated London News, April 9, 1887, 406 (as Portrait of a Lady). At its acquisition by the Nelson-Atkins Museum in 1986, the painting was regarded as \\"a stellar example of Sargent's work\\", and fetched the highest price ever paid for a Sargent painting at that time.Henry Adams, Handbook of American Paintings in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (Kansas City, Mo.: Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, 1991), 4.

The bridge carries eight lanes of traffic of the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) in an east–west direction over Twelve Mile Creek. The bridge was built during the late 1930s and formally opened on August 23, 1940. The structure was designed by the Bridge office of the Department of Highways of Ontario under Chief Bridge Engineer Arthur Sedgewick. The monuments at each end were designed by Toronto architect William Lyon Somerville, who also designed the Queen Elizabeth Way Monument at the then- eastern terminus of the QEW west of the Humber River. Somerville incorporated decorations by sculptors Frances Loring and Florence Wyle. Within the median, each entrance to the Henley Bridge incorporates the prow of a galley, variously described as being Viking or Egyptian in design, carved in Queenston limestone, with oars and warrior shield in addition to the crest of the British Royal family. Above both prows of the ship are four lions. Each lion has a shield of the other eight Canadian provinces (as Newfoundland was a separate British colony until 1949); the galley was adorned with the coats of arms of each provinces. The bridge is supported by four arches as it passes over the creek valley. There are two stone piers at each end of the bridge: the western piers have reliefs of sailing ships, while the eastern piers have a relief of a native person and a canoe on one side, as well as a Henley rower on the other. The bridge passes to the south of the section of Twelve Mile Creek designated the Royal Canadian Henley Rowing Course, which gives the bridge its name. The central railings were originally more decorative and connected the two prows. Near the bridge is the site of the original dedication of the QEW. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, on a visit to Canada, visited St. Catharines on June 7, 1939. Their car reached the intersection of Niagara Street where it crossed the QEW construction site. At that point their car broke a beam of light, unveiling signs saying \\"Queen Elizabeth Way,\\" to officially dedicate the highway. A plaque on the nearby Martindale Road bridge is inscribed with the dedication that the Royal couple \\"opened\\" the Henley bridge on June 7, 1939, although the bridge was not yet complete. A crowd of 2,000 attended the official opening of the Henley Bridge on August 23, 1940. As originally designed, the bridge carried two lanes of traffic in each direction. The bridge has since been expanded several times. In 1989-90, new concrete arches were made in an expansion to six lanes. The highway was expanded again in 2007 and now carries a total of four lanes in each direction. The original monument and pier decorations remain, but the rest of the bridge has been extensively rebuilt.

Furthermore, TNT is a scaffold-less Tissue engineering (TE) technique that can be considered cell-only or tissue inducing depending on cellular or tissue level applications. The transfection method makes use of nanochannels to deliver cargo to tissues topically.  History  Cargo delivery methods rely on carriers, for example nanoparticles, viral vectors, or physical approaches such as gene guns, microinjection, or electroporation The various methods can be limited by size constraints or their ability to efficiently deliver cargo without damaging tissue. Electroporation is a physical method which harnesses an electric field to open pores in the normally semi-permeable cell membrane through which cargo can enter. In this process, the charges can be used to drive cargo in a specific direction. Bulk electroporation (BEP) is the most conventional electroporation method. Benefits come in the form of high throughput and minimal set-up times. The downside of BEP is that the cell membrane experiences an uneven distribution of the electric field and many membranes receive irreversible damage from which they can no longer close, thus leading to low cell viability. Attempts have been made to miniaturize electroporation such as microelectroportaion (MEP) and nanochannel electroporation (NEP) which uses electroporation approached to deliver cargo through micro/nanochannels respectively. These techniques have shown to have higher efficiency of delivery, increased uniform transfection, and increased cell viability compared to BEP.  Technique  Tissue nanotransfection uses custom fabricated nanochannel arrays for nanoscale delivery of genetic cargo directly onto the surface of the skin. The postage stamp-sized chip is placed directly on the skin and an electric current is induced lasting for milliseconds to deliver the gene cargo with precise control. This approach delivers ample amounts of reprogramming factors to single-cells, creating potential for a powerful gene transfection and reprogramming method. The delivered cargo then transforms the affected cells into a desired cell type without first transforming them to stem cells. TNT is a novel technique and has been used on mice models to successfully transfect fibroblasts into neuron-like cells along with rescue of ischemia in mice models with induced vasculature and perfusion . Current methods require the fabricated TNT chip to be placed on the skin and the loading reservoir filled with a gene solution. An electrode (cathode) is placed into the well with a counter electrode (anode) placed under the chip intradermally (into the skin). The electric field generated delivers the genes. Initial TNT experiments showed that genes could be delivered to the skin of mice. Once this was confirmed, a cocktail of gene factors (ABM) used by Vierbuchen and collaborators to reprogram fibroblast into neurons was used. Delivery of these factors demonstrated successful reprogramming in-vivo and signals propagated from the epidermis to the dermis skin layers. This phenomenon is believed to be mediated by extracellular vesicles and potentially other factors [18]. Successful reprogramming was determined by performing histology and electrophysiological tests to confirm the tissue behaved as functional neurons. Beyond inducing neurons, Gallego-Perez et al also set out to induce endothelial cells in an ischemic mouse limb that, without proper blood flow, becomes necrotic and decays. Using a patented cocktail of plasmids (Etv2, Fli1, Foxc2, or EFF), these factors were delivered to the tissue above the surgery site. Using various methods, including histology and laser speckle imaging, perfusion and the establishment of new vasculature was verified as early as 7 days post- treatment. The technique was developed to combat the limitations of current approaches, such as a shortage in donors to supply cell sources and the need to induce pluripotency. Reprogramming cells in vivo takes advantage of readily available cells, bypassing the need for pre-processing. Most reprogramming methods have a heavy reliance on viral transfection TNT allows for implementation of a non-viral approach which is able to overcome issues of capsid size, increase safety, and increase deterministic reprogramming.  Development  The tissue nanotransfection technique was developed as a method to efficiently and benignly deliver cargo to living tissues. This technique builds on the high-throughput nanoelectroporation methods developed for cell reprogramming applications by Dr. Lee and Dr. Gallego-Perez of Ohio State’s Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department.. Development was a joint effort between OSU’s College of Engineering and College of Medicine led by Dr. Gallego-Perez (Ph.D), Dr. Lee (Ph.D), and Dr. Sen (Ph.D) This technology was fabricated using cleanroom techniques and photolithography and deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) of silicon wafers to create nanochannels with backside etching of a reservoir for loading desired factors as described in Gallego- Perez et al 2017. This chip is then connected to an electrical source capable of delivering an electrical field to drive the factors from the reservoir into the nanochannels, and onto the contacted tissue.

He was President of the Ontario Association of Architects, and president of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. He was an accomplished architect who designed hospitals, commercial and institutional buildings, residential buildings. Somerville designed the original McMaster University buildings in Hamilton, Ontario and the Rainbow Tower complex in Niagara Falls. He also designed several monuments, including the Clifton Gate Pioneer Memorial Arch in Niagara Falls and the Henley Bridge and Queen Elizabeth Way Monument for the new Queen Elizabeth Way superhighway built in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Somerville was born on August 5, 1886 in Hamilton, Ontario. He was educated in Hamilton and New York, New York. He first practiced architecture in the United States before World War I. He returned to Ontario to practice in 1919. When McMaster University moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Somerville was contracted by the firm of J. Francis Brown & Son to design the University's plan and several of its buildings. Somerville designed the Convocation Hall, University Hall, Hamilton Hall, Wallingford Hall, and the Refectory in the Collegiate Gothic style. Somerville would later design the Mills Memorial Library, however by then the Collegiate Gothic style was considered passé and it was designed in a contemporary style. The building now houses the McMaster Museum of Art. Somerville was a favoured architect of T. B. McQuesten, Ontario's Minister of Highways and Public Works in the mid-1930s. McQuesten was the figure in the Ontario Government responsible for many public works that Somerville was involved in. These included restoration of old forts for their touristic value. Somerville assisted in the restoration of several historic forts in Ontario: Fort Henry in Kingston, Fort George at Niagara-On- The-Lake and Fort Erie. For McQuesten, Somerville worked on the design of the Queen Elizabeth Way, which was built to facilitate the travel of American tourists into Ontario, including the Henley Bridge and the Lion Monument. Several examples of Somerville's work took place in Niagara Falls. The Honeymoon Bridge had been considered for replacement in the 1930s. Its destruction by ice necessitated the construction of a new bridge into Niagara Falls for Americans. Somerville was part of the design team for the new Rainbow Bridge and designed the Rainbow Tower, the bridge's Canadian Plaza and a bus terminal, all designed by Somerville. Somerville also designed the Clifton Gate Pioneer Memorial Arch, a Depression-era make-work project in Niagara Falls, a monumental arch to impress American visitors to the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. The arch was demolished in 1967, but portions of it were saved and are on display in Toronto. Another example of Somerville's work in Niagara Falls is the Oakes Garden Theatre, for which he collaborated with Canadian sculptors Florence Wyle, Frances Loring and Elizabeth Wyn Wood. Somerville preferred to collaborate with Canadian artists and was a member of the \\"Diet Kitchen Group\\", an informal group that were interested in fostering the connections between the decorative arts and architecture. In 1927, Somerville made a speech urging the close collaboration of fine artists and architects. \\"Architecture is the mother of the arts and it is her main object to make known art.\\" In the same speech, Somerville supported more recognition of Canadian artists. The Somerville-designed Cawthra-Elliott residence in Mississauga, Ontario is notable and designated a historic place. Somerville designed it in a Georgian Revivalist style, according to his philosophy that \\"a perfect Canadian home must descend directly from the cottages of England.\\" Somerville was also involved in national housing issues. During the 1930s, Somerville participated in efforts to simplify housing design so as to build more low-cost housing. During World War II, Somerville was involved in the effort to provide housing around munitions and other war production efforts. Somerville's work in hospitals includes the Ontario Hospital in St Thomas, Ontario, St Joseph's Hospital in Brantford, Ontario and Pembroke General Hospital in Pembroke, Ontario as well as consulting on University Hospital in Edmonton, Alberta, and additions to St Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, the Red Cross Crippled Children's Hospital in Calgary, Alberta and St Joseph's Hospital in Hamilton. Somerville's titles included Royal Canadian Academy of Arts 'Academician', a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architecture, a Fellow and President of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (1936–1938) and President of the Ontario Association of Architects (1927–1928). Somerville was also a prolific writer for Canadian Homes and Gardens magazine, in which he discussed Canadian home design. The University of Calgary honours Somerville with the \\"William Lyon Somerville Visiting Lectureship\\" in its Architecture program. In 1959, McMaster gave him an honourary doctorate of laws.

They feature broad fronts with large display windows and open interiors. Auto repair shops were generally located at the rear of a dealership, but some were located in their own utilitarian buildings. Some of the corner lots were taken up by small gas stations. In later years, sales lots were placed adjacent to dealerships in order to display a larger number of cars. Other lots were occupied by used car lots. Prior to being converted into an automobile-centric commercial area, the district was a Victorian-era residential neighborhood.

Members of the network study how the complexities of social norms, varied life experiences, details of laboratory conditions and biology interact to affect the results of neuroscientific research. Working under the label of \\"neurofeminism\\", they aim to critically analyze how the field of neuroscience operates, and to build an understanding of brain and gender that goes beyond gender essentialism while still treating the brain as fundamentally material. Its founding was part of a period of increased interest and activity in interdisciplinary research connecting neuroscience and the social sciences.  History  The group, comprising scholars who specialized in feminism, queer theory and gender studies, formed to tackle \\"neurosexism\\" as defined by Cordelia Fine in her 2010 book Delusions of Gender: \\"uncritical biases in [neuroscientific] research and public perception, and their societal impacts on an individual, structural, and symbolic level.\\" Research can suffer from neurosexism by failing to include the social factors and expectations that shape sex differences, which possibly leads to making inferences based on flawed data. By contrast, the network members advocate \\"neurofeminism\\", aiming to critically evaluate heteronormative assumptions of contemporary brain research and examine the impact and cultural significance of neuroscientific research on society's views about gender.

The manuscript, produced in the Upper Rhine region of Southern Germany in the early 14th century, contains the full Hebrew text of the Haggadah, a ritual text recounting the story of Passover – the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt – which is recited by participants at a Passover Seder. The text is executed in block calligraphy and accompanied by colorful illustrations of Jews performing the Seder practices and reenacting Jewish historical events. The Birds' Head Haggadah is so called because all Jewish men, women, and children depicted in the manuscript have human bodies with the faces and beaks of birds. Non-Jewish and non-human faces (such as those of angels, the sun, and the moon) are blank or blurred. Numerous theories have been advanced to explain the unusual iconography, usually tied to Jewish aniconism. The Haggadah is in the possession of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, where it is on permanent exhibition.

This text is recited by participants at a Passover Seder. Illuminated manuscripts of the Haggadah began appearing in the 13th century, and printed Haggadahs began to be published in the 15th century. The Birds' Head Haggadah is an illuminated manuscript dated to the beginning of the 14th century. The style and coloring of the figures reflects that of other illuminated manuscripts from the Upper Rhine region of Southern Germany in that era, perhaps from the vicinity of Würzburg, and the architectural backgrounds are sufficiently detailed to date and locate the manuscript. The Birds' Head Haggadah is believed to be the first illustrated Haggadah produced in its own binding, distinct from the Jewish prayer book. The manuscript measures long by wide. It is believed to have originally contained about 50 pages, gathered into five bindings of eight pages each and one binding of 10 pages. In its current condition, it contains 47 pages. =Text= The text was copied by a scribe named Menahem; the letters of his Hebrew name, מנחם, are graphically accentuated in the similarly-spelled Hebrew word מֻנָּחִים (Munahim) in the Haggadah text, revealing his signature. The scribe Menahem is also credited with copying the Leipzig Machzor (High Holy Days prayerbook) around the same time; he encoded his name in that illuminated manuscript in a \\"decorated text panel\\". Each page of the Birds' Head Haggadah contains 12 rows of text, copied in block calligraphy. The calligraphy and illustrations were executed in dark brown ink and tempera on parchment. The extant manuscript shows smaller, densely packed script written in the margins of some pages, detailing instructions for conducting the Seder and fulfilling the laws pertaining to Passover. \\"Captions\\" have also been appended to certain illustrations. According to Epstein, these glosses and captions were added by unknown owners of the Haggadah over the centuries. =Illustrations= (L. to r.) A Jewish man, woman, and child shape and prick holes in handmade matzos in preparation for baking Detail of a bird-headed Jewish man placing matzo in an oven The manuscript contains two full-page miniatures. The first, placed at the beginning, depicts a husband and wife seated at their Seder table. The second, appearing at the end of the Haggadah, depicts a vision of a rebuilt Jerusalem in the messianic era. In addition to the full-page miniatures, 33 pages in the manuscript have illustrations in the margins. These illustrations, which closely follow the text, depict Jewish men and women performing Passover and Seder practices, and also reenacting events in Jewish history. The Passover and Seder-themed reenactments include the roasting of the Paschal lamb; the baking of matzos; grinding the bitter herbs; eating the bitter herbs with charoset; leaning on one's left side at the Seder; breaking the middle matzo, and so on. Historical depictions include the Binding of Isaac; the Jewish people hurriedly leaving Egypt with their matzos, which did not have time to rise; Pharaoh and his army pursuing the Jewish nation to the Red Sea; Moses receiving the two Tablets of Stone from heaven and giving over the Pentateuch to the Jewish people; and the Jews receiving manna from heaven during their wanderings in the desert. The Jewish characters are dressed in medieval German-Jewish clothing, and the pointed \\"Jewish hat\\" mandated by the Church beginning in the 13th century is seen on Jewish leaders and teachers, including Moses. Yet while the Jewish characters all have human bodies, and some also have human hair and beards, and wear helmets or women's snoods, their faces are those of \\"sharp-beaked and sharp-eyed birds\\". A large beak occupies the place where the nose and mouth should be. Epstein notes that the birds' heads are not uniform, but individualized according to the \\"age, sex, and status\\" of the character. Some characters have pigs' ears as well. The faces of non-Jewish characters, in contrast – such as Pharaoh and the ancient Egyptians – and non-human characters such as angels, the sun, and the moon, are blank or blurred. An unknown artist subsequently added facial features to the Egyptian soldiers, but these additions either faded or were rubbed out. Exodus from Egypt: bird-headed Jews bake matzos for the journey and leave Egypt with their possessions (left-hand page); a blank-faced Pharaoh and Egyptian soldiers pursue the Jewish nation (right-hand page) Interpretations Numerous theories have been advanced to explain the choice of facial features in the Haggadah's illustrations. A prevalent theory for the use of bird rather than human faces is the illustrator's attempt to circumvent the Second Commandment prohibition against making a graven image, in the tradition of Jewish aniconism. Other Ashkenazi Hebrew illuminated manuscripts from the 13th and 14th centuries depict humans with animal heads in keeping with this prohibition. Notably, the Leipzig Machzor, copied by the same scribe who copied the Birds' Head Haggadah, features human-looking faces with noses resembling curved beaks. Epstein theorizes that the choice of birds' heads for the Jewish figures in the Birds' Head Haggadah hints at the spiritual and national characteristics of the Jewish people. He argues that the beaked visages in the manuscript are not birds' heads at all, but the heads of griffins. The legendary griffin – the body of which resembles both a lion and an eagle – reflects the prevalent use of \\"lion-eagle-human hybrids\\" in Jewish iconography. Moreover, the lion-eagle-human hybrid incorporates three of the four creatures represented in Ezekiel's vision of the divine chariot (), suggesting a connection between the Jewish people and God. The lion may also allude to the symbol of the tribe of Judah while the eagle evokes the symbol of the German emperor, suggesting the Jews' identification as both subjects of the realm and as Jews. Epstein further theorizes that the blank faces assigned to non-Jewish and non-human figures sends a message to Jewish readers of the Haggadah that these entities have no intrinsic power, but are subject to God's will. Art historian Meyer Schapiro, who wrote an introduction to the first facsimile edition of the Haggadah published by M. Spitzer in 1965, maintains that the birds' heads are those of eagles, noting a very similar head on \\"an unmistakable eagle\\" in the contemporary Christian Codex Manesse. The Imperial Eagle was the heraldic symbol of the Holy Roman Emperor, under whose protection Jews in Germany lived, which the depiction as eagles may symbolize. In addition, a number of biblical passages can be taken as identifying the Jews with eagles, including , especially relevant to the Passover, and Carol Zemel postulates that the birds' heads affixed to Jewish men and women going about their Passover preparations are a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the animal-head gods worshipped by the ancient Egyptians. This connection elevates the spiritual importance of the Jews' work. Ruth Malinkoff, in her 1999 book Antisemitic Hate Signs in Hebrew: Illuminated Manuscripts from Medieval Germany, asserts that the appendage of pigs' ears to some Jewish characters clues the reader to the fact that these are antisemitic caricatures instigated by Christian artists. Jewish artists, who were more familiar with the Hebrew text, did the design and copying, and the manuscript was commissioned by Jews as well, but Christian antisemitism heavily influenced the illustrations. This expressed itself in the \\"stereotypical long noses\\" and \\"large eyes\\", the pigs' ears, and the conical hat worn by many Jewish figures. The fact that the birds' heads themselves are those of birds of prey – which are ritually impure according to Jewish law – also point to the antisemitic undertones of the manuscript, according to Malinkoff. However, Meyer Schapiro believes the artists were Jewish, trained in the contemporary Gothic idiom, and confident in their style, but \\"not in the forefront\\" of contemporary artists; the manuscript \\"now so exceptional, was in its day a piece of local everyday art\\". Epstein also challenges Malinkoff's assertion that an antisemitic manuscript would be accepted by its Jewish patrons. He notes: > Instead, it makes more sense to assume that the griffins' heads were the > specific choice of the patrons. Far from being anti-Jewish caricatures, the > griffin-headed figures in the Birds' Head Haggadah are dignified portrayals > of Jews, full of character and personality. All are going seriously about > their business or are posed with stateliness and monumentality in spite of > the singular strangeness of their heads. Provenance The Birds' Head Haggadah on display at the Israel Museum, 2013 The original patron of the Haggadah is unknown. In the 20th century, the manuscript was owned by the family of Johanna Benedikt, who gave it as a wedding present to Benedikt's new husband, German Jewish lawyer and parliamentarian Ludwig Marum. Marum reportedly stored the manuscript in his law office. Following his arrest and deportation by the Nazis in 1933, the manuscript disappeared. It resurfaced in 1946 in Jerusalem when Herbert Kahn, a German Jewish refugee, sold it to the Bezalel National Museum, the predecessor of the Israel Museum, for $600. The museum keeps the manuscript on permanent exhibition. Shimon Jeselsohn, a law colleague of Marum in Germany who immigrated to Israel after the war, read about the museum's acquisition of the manuscript and connected it with the work that he had seen in Marum's possession. He wrote to Marum's daughter, Elisabeth, who was then living in New York, to tell her of the Haggadah's whereabouts. In 1984 Elisabeth made a trip to Israel and saw the manuscript in the museum; afterwards she wrote a letter to the museum saying that Kahn \\"had no right to sell\\" their family's Haggadah, but that the family would allow the museum to keep the Haggadah on exhibit \\"for the benefit of the public\\". According to her daughter, Elisabeth thought there was no way she could retrieve the manuscript, so she did not try to. =Ownership dispute= Ludwig Marum In 2016 Marum's grandchildren, led by Marum's 75-year-old grandson Eli Barzilai, began demanding compensation, claiming the Haggadah had been sold without the family's permission. Barzilai engaged the services of E. Randol Schoenberg, a U.S. attorney specializing in the recovery of Nazi-looted artwork. According to Artnet, the compensation demand was \\"less than\\" USD$10 million. In addition to financial reimbursement, the family asked for the manuscript to be renamed the \\"Marum Haggadah\\". The Israel Museum has acknowledged the family's ownership claim predating World War II. It has requested documentation of ownership between 1933 and 1946, at which point it purchased the Haggadah from Kahn. In late 2016 the Marum family obtained more than 1,000 documents from German historians in Karlsruhe, which depict Kahn as a low-paid schoolteacher in constant need of cash. The family asserted that Kahn somehow obtained the Haggadah without their permission, but that they do not think he stole it. Other editions In 1965/1967 a two- volume color facsimile edition of the Birds' Head Haggadah was published in Israel by M. Spitzer, bringing the manuscript to international attention. In 1997 Koren Publishers, in conjunction with the Israel Museum, published The Haggada of Passover: With Pop-Up Spreads, incorporating illustrations from the Birds' Head Haggadah. Designed for children, the book is printed on heavy cardstock and incorporates pop-ups and pull-tabs for users to manipulate the illustrations of the bird-headed characters reenacting historical and Seder practices. The illustrations include the reenactments of the Ten Plagues, baking matzo, crossing the Red Sea, drinking the Four Cups at the Passover Seder, and more. The Haggadah's Hebrew text is supplemented by Koren's English translation. The pop-up book was reprinted in 2008, and again in 2012.

They play a role in defense against helminth infections, in allergic responses, in autoimmunity, and tumor suppression.  Characterization  TH9 cells are characterized by their cell surface expression of CD4 and CCR6 and the lack of CCR4. Additionally, they are defined by their high secretion of interleukin‑9. Besides IL-9, TH9 cells also produce IL-10 and IL-21. However, their functions in TH9 cells are still unclear.  Differentation  Th9 cells can differentiate either from naive T lymphocytes or by a shift from TH2 cells. There are numbers of cytokines, transcription factors and other molecules, that have a role in TH9 differentiation. = Cytokines in differentiation = Cytokines play a major role in development of TH9 cells. There are many cytokines impacting differentiation of TH9 cells and their production of IL-9 but IL-4 and TGF-β are indispensable for their development and polarization. IL-4 and TGF-β are necessary for naive T lymphocytes to differentiate into TH9 cells. while TGF-β alone can switch TH2 cells into TH9 cells. IL-2 is critical for interleukin-9 production by TH9 cells. IL-1 may induce IL-9 in some cases, and IL-33 is able to induce IL-9 in T cells generally. Generally IL-1 family members enhance expression of Il9 gene. IL-25 also induces IL-9 production in vivo. Development of TH9 cells requires a balanced cytokines signaling for its establishment. All mentioned cytokines then signal through specific transcription factors, which are later on required for a TH9 polarization. = Transcription factors in differentiation = STAT6, IRF4, GATA3 are absolutely required for TH9 cell development and other such as PU.1, BATF, NF-κB, NFAT1, STAT5, AP-1 contribute to TH9 sub-population commitment and to IL-9 production. STAT6 is activated by signaling through IL-4 receptor. Once activated, phosphorylated STAT6 mediate the transcription of Gata3 and Irf4, which are both necessary for polarization of TH9 cells. STAT6 repress the expression of transcription factors T-bet and Foxp3 in TH9 cells, that normally block IL-9 production. GATA-3 in TH9 cells development represses transcriptional factor FOXP3, which would other wise let to other T helper cell subpopulation. IRF4 binds to the promoter of Il-9 gene in TH9 cells and it is dependent on STAT6. BATF has been also shown to bind to the Il-9 gene promoter and to activate Il-9gene transcription. PU.1 works by directly binding to the promoter of Il-9 gene and attract chromatin-modifying enzymes which reinforce Il9-gene transcription. NF-κB and NFAT1, are needed for a TCR- induced interleukin-9 production by TH9 cells. STAT5, downstream factor of IL-2, induce TH9 cells IL-9. STAT5 directly bind to Il-9 gene promoter, although it has not yet been determined how important this pathway is for TH9 development in vitro and in vivo. = Molecules with regulatory effects = Numbers of molecules enhance or dampen IL-9 production and contribute to TH9 development such as: Activin A that can fully substitute the role of TGF-β in TH9 cells, then Jagged2, programmed cell death ligand (PD-L2), cyclooxy- genase (COX)-2, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4 (TNFRSF4 or OX40), and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP).  Physiological functions  The main physiological role of TH9 cells, while poorly defined, is defense against helminthic infections. This is likely mediated by local and/or systemic production of Interleukin-9, as well as promoted survival of other anti- parasitic leukocytes, including mast cells, eosinophils and basophils. Th9 cells have also shown both pro- and anti-tumorigenic activity, depending on the type of cancer. They have been shown to inhibit melanoma cell growth, increase anti-tumor lymphocytes, and drastically lower tumor mass and disease severity. On the other hand patients suffering hepatocellular carcinoma with high TH9 infiltration had shorter disease-free survival period after surgical resection.  Pathophysiological functions  TH9 cells appear to be linked to many pathophysiological processes. Their exact role is poorly understood, as they appear to have a pleiotropic effect and seem to be heavily dependent on the local, as well as systemic, cytokine environment. =Allergies= TH9 cells are present in the peripheral blood of allergic patients while such a population is rare in non-allergic persons. Few studies have reported distinct correlations of in vivo IL-9 with serum IgE concentration. The percentages of IL-9-secreting T cells of atopic patients also correlated with serum IgE in adults with asthma. Two studies showed that transferred TH9 cells result in allergic inflammation in the lung. It was also observed that TH9 cells can promote intestinal and central nervous system inflammation. =Asthma= TH9 cells are strongly linked to asthma given their presence in draining lymph nodes and airways. TH9-Derived IL-9 has been shown to exacerbate the allergic immune response by enhancing antibody production and increasing cell infiltration inside of the respiratory tract. =Autoimmune inflammation= TH9 cells contribute to ulcerative colitis, due to the cell’s ability to impair cellular repair. This may also play a role in TH9 tumor suppression (see \\"Physiological functions\\" above). TH9 have been shown to play a role in both early and progressive phase of multiple sclerosis by decreasing the effects of pro-inflammatory TH17. Increased levels of IL-9, mainly produced by TH9 have been detected in patients in remission phase of the disease. However, in vitro differentiated Th9 have been shown to induce EAE and cause peripheral neuropathies in mice, emphasizing the importance of context in which the cells develops and functions. = Chronic infections = A higher percentage of TH9 cells in patients with chronic HCV was linked to higher levels of liver enzymes, more severe disease progression and faster development of HCC. Also remission and faster HCV clearance was associated with lower TH9 cytokines' leves. This might be caused by TH9 mediated promotion of TH17 phenotype and hindering of TH1 phenotype which leads to persisting viral infection. There were several publications trying to elucidate role of TH9 cells in chronic HBV infection with inconsistent results.

Gameplay  Biomutant is an action role-playing game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective in which the player takes control of a mammalian warrior in a world filled with mutated animals. The first thing for the player to do is to customise their own character. Sex, length, body shape and thickness, fur, fangs, and many other attributes can be tweaked and all have direct impact on the statistics of the playable character during gameplay. A thicker character is heavier, which makes it slower but on the flip side allows it to deal and resist more damage. The combat system combines melee attacks with long-range shooting. The player collects parts throughout the game and combines these parts to create a weapon. Each part has its own effect on the statistics of the end product. The game features a variety of Affixes, including cryogenic and electrical, which are effective in battles. When a cryogenic part is put onto a weapon, enemies will freeze when hit. The player can combine the power of multiple weapons by switching between different weapons during combat. The protagonist is able to dodge to the left, right, and backward, as well as jump. Besides leveling up the playable character, the player can also use level up points to strengthen their attributes or to unlock new attack combinations. Another way to learn new moves is by interacting with specific characters in each area. Most moves are based on weapons, which can be crafted using the game's weapon crafting system. Throughout the game, players can also change their abilities, looks by mutations and bio-mechanical body parts such as attaching robotic legs, wings and claws which can be used to get various advantages against certain enemies or at certain locations. In order to reach specific areas, the player must change body parts, equip gear that is suited for that area, or obtain specific vehicles, such as an air balloon or jet skis. This way, the player can overcome obstacles introduced by their surroundings, such as the limited oxygen availability in Death Zone: by wearing a gas mask or an oxygen container, the player is able to venture deeper into the area and explore new places that cannot be reached without any precautions, while an even bigger part of the area can be reached by obtaining a mech. The game's world can be seamlessly explored by the player on foot, by flying or using an air balloon, jet ski and mech. It also features a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle which affect the gameplay and enemy behavior. The story is mission-based and mission lines are character-based. Certain characters will provide the player quest lines that are emanating from their area. The more the player interacts with this character, the wider the arc of that specific area becomes. Biomutant also features a Karma system for non-playable characters and a companion system for recruiting allies for fighting and travelling alongside with the player. Depending on the actions, interactions, and decisions made by the player throughout the whole game, the stances characters take can change, which has an influence on the continuation of the story as dialogues and quest lines will be changed. The story is fully narrated. As playtime increases, the narration level scales down. Players will also be able to manually adjust the narration frequency.  Plot  Biomutant has branching storylines where decisions made by the player will decide how the story will continue. The world of Biomutant is struck by a natural disaster as poisonous oil comes up from beneath the surface and pollutes the Tree of Life. The Tree of Life has five roots through which it gives life to the whole world. In order to save the Tree of Life, players need to go to the end of each root, where aside from the oil a creature is destroying the root by gnawing at it. There are also six tribes that are split from their original enclave. Three of them want to heal the Tree of Life, while the three others plan to do things on their own. Each tribe can be influenced through the Karma system. The player can ally with a tribe and eliminate other tribes in order to grow the power of the allied tribe in the world, although the player can also decide on the Tree of Life's fate without having to murder any of the tribes if they want to.  Development  Promotion at gamescom 2018 Biomutant is the first game of the Swedish development studio Experiment 101, which was established in the Summer of 2015 by former Avalanche Studios employees. After working on the Just Cause series for many years, the founders of the studio wanted to go back to the basics of video game development and create a game that is \\"fun in a good way\\". Experiment 101 has a flat organization and had 18 employees in August 2018. Development on Biomutant started soon after the foundation of the studio. On August 19, 2017, an advertisement in the German gaming magazine GamesMarkt revealed the existence of the game, dubbing it as a \\"post- apocalyptic kung-fu fable\\", before being fully announced on August 21. The game was playable later that week at the German trade show Gamescom. In an interview which was published the day after the announcement of the game, Experiment 101's head of studio Stefan Ljungqvist said that the game already was content complete. He also mentioned that one of the most difficult things for the development team was to balance the combat system in order to \\"combine shooting, melee [attacks], and abilities in a quite intuitive way\\". Unreal Engine 4 is being used for the game's development.

Arising primarily from Cultural Studies, it takes a critical stance toward changes to the university since the 1970s, particularly the shift away from a strong public model of higher education to a neoliberal privatized model. Emerging largely in the United States, which has the most extensive system of higher education, the field has also seen significant work in the United Kingdom, as well as in other countries confronting neoliberalism. Key themes of CUS research are corporatization, academic labor, and student debt, among other issues. Like those doing research under the banner of Critical Legal Studies (CLS), scholars of Critical University Studies often have an activist bent.Unger, Roberto Mangabeira, The Critical Legal Studies Movement. New York: Verso, 2015. CLS and CUS both analyze powerful institutions in order to draw attention to structural inequalities and embedded practices of exploitation and marginalization. In addition, both fields seek to move beyond abstract theorizing, targeting institutional practices and making proposals for policy changes. In contrast to CLS, which has roots in elite institutions like Harvard and Yale, CUS largely comes out of public colleges and universities. While CLS has tended to seek remedies in the legal system, CUS has gravitated toward student and labor union movements. Moreover, CUS has emphasized investigative reportage and exposés of current institutional policies and practices alongside academic work. Rather than a uniform group, CUS includes a range of scholars, critics, and activists, among them tenured professors, graduate students, and adjunct instructors.  History  The term “Critical University Studies” was first defined in print by Jeffrey J. Williams in a 2012 article in The Chronicle of Higher Education.Williams, Jeffrey J. \\"An Emerging Field Deconstructs Academe.\\" The Chronicle of Higher Education, February 19, 2012.Jaschik, Scott. \\"Critical University Studies.\\" Inside Higher Ed, January 9, 2015. The piece, “An Emerging Field Deconstructs Academe,” describes the “new wave of criticism of higher education” that came to the fore in the 1990s and has gained momentum in the ensuing decades. This new work has primarily come from literary and cultural critics, as well as those in education, history, sociology, and labor studies. As Williams notes, criticism of higher education has a strong tradition, and scholars like Heather Steffen have traced CUS's lineage at least to the early 20th century, for example to Thorstein Veblen’s The Higher Learning in America: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Business Men (1918) and Upton Sinclair’s The Goose-Step: A Study of American Education (1923), which criticize the influence of business principles and Gilded Age wealth on the emerging university system.Steffen, Heather. “Intellectual Proletarians in the 20th Century.” Chronicle of Higher Education. November 28, 2011.Veblen, Thorstein. The Higher Learning in America: A Memorandum on the Conduct of Universities by Business Men. 1918. Ed. Richard R. Teichgraeber III. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015.Sinclair, Upton. The Goose-Step: A Study of American Higher Education. Whitefish: Kessinger, 1923. In addition, the 1960s saw a great deal of criticism of social institutions, and much focused on university campuses. Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) started with a strong statement about higher education, and anti-war and civil rights protests were a major presence on US campuses. The Critical Pedagogy movement, inspired by Paolo Freire and furthered by Henry Giroux and others, arose from this moment.Loughead, Tanya. Critical University: Moving Higher Education Forward. Lanham: MD, Lexington Books, 2017. The feminist movement also played a role in criticism of the university during the ‘60s and ‘70s, with activists like Adrienne Rich calling for “a women-centered university.”Rich, Adrienne. “Toward a Woman-Centered University.” On Lies, Secrets, and Silence: Selected Prose 1966-1978. New York: Norton, 1979. 125-55. In 1980, the Bayh-Dole Act granted universities the right to patent their inventions, thereby encouraging them to conduct research with business aims in mind. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, critics began to address the new direction of higher education, often coming from the graduate student unionization movement. Some met in conferences such as “Reworking/Rethinking the University” at the University of Minnesota (2008–11), or came out of groups such as Edu-factory, which was inspired by the Italian autonomist movement.\\"Conference – Beneath the University, the Commons.\\" Reworking/Rethinking the University. November 17, 2009.The Edu-factory Collective, ed. Toward a Global Autonomous University. New York, NY: Autonomedia, 2009. This first wave of CUS publications addressed the corporatization of higher education, along with the exploitation of academic labor and the rise of student debt. Key texts from this period include Sheila Slaughter and Larry Leslie's Academic Capitalism: Politics, Policies, and the Entrepreneurial University (1997), David Noble's Digital Diploma Mills: The Automation of Higher Education (2001), Marc Bousquet's “The Waste Product of Graduate Education” (2002) and How the University Works: Higher Education and the Low-Wage Nation (2008).Walker, Katherine, and Benjamin Mangrum. \\"Rebuilding out of the Ruins: An Introduction to 'The Academy and Its Futures'.\\" Ethos Review 1, no. 2 (Fall 2014).Slaughter, Sheila, and Larry L.

More recently, a second wave of CUS scholars have widened the field's scope to address issues including universities’ reliance on proprietorial technology, the dominance of entrepreneurial values, and globalization. Notable texts in this vein include Newfield's The Great Mistake: How We Wrecked Public Universities and How We Can Fix Them (2016), Michael Fabricant and Stephen Brier's Austerity Blues: Fighting for the Soul of Public Higher Education (2016), Benjamin Ginsberg's The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters (2011), Robert Samuels’ Why Public Higher Education Should Be Free: How to Decrease Cost and Increase Quality at American Universities (2013).Newfield, Christopher.

In addition, after Britain adopted neoliberal policies and raised tuitions from minor fees to major levels, critics such as Stefan Collini, in “Browne’s Gamble” (2010), and Andrew McGettigan, in The Great University Gamble: Money, Markets, and the Future of Higher Education (2013), focused on the United Kingdom. Meng-Hsuan Chou, Isaac Kamola, and Tamson Pietsch's edited volume The Transnational Politics of Higher Education (2016) looks at globalization.Collini, Stefan. “Browne’s Gamble,” London Review of Books, 32(21): 23-25, 4 November 2010.McGettigan, Andrew.

The Transnational Politics of Higher Education: Contesting the Global/Transforming the Local. London: Routledge, 2016.  Key themes  Although continually responding to new trends in higher education, Critical University Studies has so far concerned itself with several key themes: * Privatization and Corporatization: CUS research shows the various ways that public investment in universities has decreased as costs have been shifted to students and their families. As a 2014 report from public policy organization Demos shows, state funding for higher education has progressively decreased since the 1980s.Hiltonsmith, Robert, and Tamara Draut. \\"The Great Cost Shift Continues: State Higher Education Funding After the Recession.\\" Demos. March 21, 2014. At the same time, universities appear to be acting more and more like corporations, enhancing managerial administration, cutting full-time faculty labor, and treating students like customers. The result is a higher education system that functions as “a mercantile market rather than a public realm apart from the market,” with those attending reconfigured “as job seekers rather than as citizens” — a dramatic alteration from the liberal humanistic university of the postwar US.Williams, Jeffrey J. “The Need for Critical University Studies,” in A New Deal for the Humanities: Liberal Arts and the Future of Public Higher Education. Edited by Gordon Hutner and Feisal G. Mohamed. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2016. 145-157. * Labor: According to the New Faculty Majority, a US-based adjunct advocacy group that formed in 2009, three quarters of college faculty are now off the tenure track, with no access to the job stability that universities historically provided.\\"Facts about adjuncts.\\" New Faculty Majority. January 16, 2015. Of this group, over half are adjunct or part-time workers, positions characterized by low wages and lack of job security. CUS takes issue with this new norm of precarious labor, as well as with the increasing burden on graduate students to take on heavy teaching loads. As such, CUS has organic connections to graduate student unionization and adjunct labor organization efforts. * Student Debt: In 2015, 68% of graduating students in the US left college with some student loan debt.Friedman, Zack. \\"Student Loan Debt In 2017: A $1.3 Trillion Crisis.\\" Forbes, February 21, 2017. This marks a dramatic increase from student debt during previous eras of higher education, a development that CUS attributes to the effects of neoliberal policies on universities. For one thing, higher education now tends to be framed as a private endeavor rather than as a public service, a shift that has resulted in reductions to state funding and subsequent increases in tuition costs.Rizzo, Michael J. “State Preferences for Higher Education Spending: A Panel Data Analysis, 1977-2001.” What’s Happening to Public Higher Education? The Shifting Financial Burden. Ed. Ronald G. Ehrenberg. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006. 3-35. Since 1980, the cost of a college degree has increased nearly 1000% (while the price of consumer goods has increased only about 250%).\\"Cost Of College Degree In U.S. Has Increased 1,120 Percent In 30 Years, Report Says.\\" HuffPost. August 15, 2012. This has been exacerbated by a shift in policy for for-profit institutions: Since the late 1990s, they have been able to receive up to 90% of their funding from federal aid, and they now represent around 25% of loan debt.Shen, Lucinda. \\"For-Profit Colleges Account for a Third of All Federal Student Loan Defaults.\\" Fortune. September 29, 2016.Kelchen, Robert. \\"How Much Do For-Profit Colleges Rely on Federal Funds?\\" Brookings. January 11, 2017. In addition to raising awareness about the issue of growing student debt, CUS scholars push for policy changes, such as loan forgiveness and debt-free college. * Globalization: American universities are increasingly being exported to locations around the globe through the opening of satellite and affiliate campuses. This practice—exemplified by schools like New York University, Carnegie Mellon University, and Duke University—often seems to be profit-driven rather than beneficent, with universities receiving large sums of money from local governments in exchange for the presence of the school's brand. For many scholars, the so-called “global university” is merely a perpetuation of Western hegemony. * Innovation and Entrepreneurship: A new wave of CUS research has drawn attention to the increasing emphasis that universities place on values of innovation and entrepreneurship. While this focus may seem harmless or even beneficial to students, CUS scholars point out the damaging effects of structuring student's college experience around these buzzwords. Both terms reflect the infiltration of a business mindset into academics, with “innovation” often entailing the mechanization of teaching and a subsequent increase in inequality among student populations.Williams, Jeffrey J. \\"Innovation for What? The Politics of Inequality in Higher Education.\\" Dissent, Winter 2016. Similarly, entrepreneurship encourages students to adopt a corporate work ethos, with science and tech companies—and increasingly Silicon Valley billionaires—reaping the benefits of student labor.Wiscomb, Avery J. \\"Hyperserfs: How Silicon Valley Exploits Students and Their Universities.\\" The Chronicle for Higher Education, March 12, 2017.  Influence  Critical University Studies research has contributed to student and faculty movements across US campuses, including the aforementioned New Faculty Majority, the graduate student union movement, Oregon's CORE faculty- student advocacy group, and the Occupy Student Debt Campaign (on which cultural critic Andrew Ross has worked).Ross, Andrew. Creditocracy and the Case for Debt Refusal. New York: OR Books, 2014.Petrina, Stephen. \\"Critical University Studies: Workplace, Milestones, Crossroads, Respect, Truth.\\" Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor 23 (2014): 62-72. CUS scholars often publish outside of traditional academic outlets, through blogs like Michael Meranze and Christopher Newfield's Remaking the University, as well as through contributions to new media like Jacobin, the Los Angeles Review of Books (LARB), Salon and HuffPost.Newfield, Christopher, and Michael Meranze. Remaking the University. Through such non-traditional outlets, as well as through book publications and academic journal articles, CUS has helped to bring issues like student debt into the mainstream political conversation. = Unionization = Alongside CUS criticism and activism in the 1990s, U.S. campuses saw a rise in unionization efforts. This culminated in a 2000 decision by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that graduate employees were protected by the National Labor Relations Act and could unionize.United Automobile Workers. \\"UAW Graduate Workers and Harvard Reach Historic Union Election Agreement.\\" News release, October 18, 2016. UAW. Union efforts proliferated following this decision, with organizations like the United Automobile Workers (UAW) and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) allying with graduate students and adjunct instructors in the fight for employee status and collective bargaining rights. Despite setbacks, including a 2004 reversal of the 2000 ruling, student and adjunct unions have made significant headway. In August 2016, the NLRB reversed itself again, ruling that graduate research and teaching assistants at private universities do have the right to unionize (UAW vs. Columbia).Gonzales, Richard.\\"NLRB Rules Graduate Students Are Employees With The Right To Unionize.\\" NPR, August 23, 2016.  Developments  The journal Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor, co-founded by Bousquet, stemmed from early efforts in the field and continues to publish open-access issues around themes of academic labor and higher education activism.Workplace: A Journal for Academic Labor. In addition, 2015 saw the formation of Academic Labor: Research and Artistry, a journal devoted to issues of tenure and contingency in the university.Academic Labor: Research and Artistry. In book publishing, The Johns Hopkins University Press initiated a book series on Critical University Studies, edited by Jeffrey J. Williams and Christopher Newfield, and In the UK, Palgrave also launched a series on CUS, edited by John Smyth.The Johns Hopkins University Press. \\"Critical University Studies.\\" News release, January 2015.\\"Palgrave Critical University Studies.\\" Palgrave Macmillan. On the whole, the stance of CUS against the status quo of US universities puts it at odds with individuals and administrators who are in favor of the continued privatization, corporatization, and globalization of the university. Scholars like Williams, Steffen, and others continue to call for the incorporation of CUS into the undergraduate curriculum, encouraging students to think critically about the institutions in which they find themselves.Williams, Jeffrey J. “Teach the University!” Pedagogy (8)1: 25-42, 2007.Samuels, Robert. \\"Introduction: Teaching Critical University Studies.\\" Radical Teacher, Spring 2017.

The youngest of six children of a coal miner, she was influenced by church music in her youth. Guy's debut came at Sadler's Wells Theatre and several of her early engagements were with the London Mozart Players. She became principal mezzo at the Royal Opera House in 1963 and made the first of several appearance at The Proms that same year. In 1969, Guy was selected as one of fifteen soloists to sing at the Investiture of the Prince of Wales and later joined the Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt in 1972. She took up a teaching position with the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama which she retired from in 1998 to teach privately at her home in Sageston. Early life and education She was born Ruth Maureen Guy on 10 July 1932 in Penclawdd, west of Swansea. She was the youngest of six children of a coal miner, who died while Guy was in her early childhood. Guy attended school in the nearby village of Gowerton. She became influenced in music with church music performed at the nearby Brethel Capel and sang at the National Eisteddfod. At the age of 18, she won a Glamoran Scholarship to study at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. While at the school, she earned praise from The Times's music critic for her account of the aria \\"Inflammatus\\" from Antonín Dvořák's orchestra Stabat Mater in December 1954. Guy focused on her studies, and made the finals of the 1955 Kathleen Ferrier Award, and despite not winning, her \\"rich and expressive contralto\\" was respected. Career Guy made her debut as a mezzo-soprano singer at Sadler's Wells Theatre as Dryade in Ariadne auf Naxos. She gave a recital at London's Wigmore Hall, where she sang arias by George Friedrich Händel and Gaetano Donizett in 1957. Guy received praise for her performance and one critic noted \\"the assurance with which [she] projected her resonant contralto tone … was irresistible\\". The following year, she married the tenor John Mitchinson at Bethel Chapel, Penclawdd. Several of Guy's early engagements were with the London Mozart Players under their founder and conductor Harry Blech. One such concert was the one to mark the 150th anniversary of Joseph Haydn's death at the Royal Festival Hall in May 1959. In 1960, she sang in Schubert's Mass with the same orchestra. She participated in a concert to commemorate astronaut Yuri Gagarin's achievement of being the first human to go into space the following year. By the early 1960s Guy featured regularly as a soloist in London and became principal mezzo at the Royal Opera House in 1963. That same year, she played Flosshilde in Hans Hotter's production of Götterdämmerung at Covent Garden with fellow sopranos Rita Hunter and Birgit Nilsson and conducted by Georg Solti. This was followed by Deliah in Samson and Deliah by Camille Saint-Saëns at Sadler's Wells Theatre. Guy's performances came under criticism for her limited range of vocal colour in her characterisation. Her first appearance at The Proms came in the same year in the Richard Wagner 150th anniversary concert under Solti. Guy appeared at the Proms two years later in Arnold Schoenberg's Moses und Aron with Solti performing, and the following year, performed in Parsifal. She sang overseas by travelling across Europe and to Australia and New Zealand. Guy appeared in Igor Stravinsky's Oedipus rex in 1966 in the Odeon of Herodes Atticus and was conducted by the composer himself, and two years later appeared in the Malcolm Sargent memorial concert with Colin Davis conducting at the First Night of the Proms. She was chosen as one of fifteen soloists to perform at the Investiture of the Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle on 1 July 1969. In 1971, Guy sang at the 80th birthday concert for Stravinsky. Guy joined the Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt in 1972 and five years later acted as the Countess in the Welsh National Opera's performance of The Queen of Spades with David Lloyd-Jones serving as conductor. She and her husband Mitchinson frequently performed at the Three Choirs Festival, where she played the Angel in Edward Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius in 1977 at Gloucester. Guy also maintained close connections with the Philomusica, the West Country choir. Later life and death After retiring from her teaching position at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in 1998, Guy began teaching privately at her home in Sageston, Pembrokeshire until a few weeks before her death. She died on 14 February 2015 in Haverfordwest and was survived by her husband and two sons. Guy was given a funeral service at Carew Wesley Methodist Chapel and later a memorial service at Parc Gwyn Crematorium.

As with two other famous war memoirs-—Siegfried Sassoon's Sherston trilogy, and Robert Graves' Good-Bye to All That--Undertones represents Blunden's first prose publication, and was one of the earliest contributors to the flurry of Great War books to come out of England in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Synopsis Paul Fussell has called Undertones of War an \\"extended elegy in prose,\\" and critics have commented on its lack of central narrative. Like Henri Barbusse's Under Fire and Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, the text presents a series of war-related episodes rather than a distinct, teleological narrative. Reviews According to Paul Fussell, in Blunden's “writing about horror and violence, understatement delivers the point more effectively than either idealism or heavy emphasis.” G.S. Fraser, meanwhile, has called the text \\"the best war poem,\\" despite its prose form, and went so far as to print sections as poetry in the London Magazine.

In August 2017, Allsup attended the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, mainly to record the events for his YouTube channel. After the rally turned violent, he resigned as president of the College Republicans at WSU in 2017, before being re-elected later in November of the same year. He was unable to take the position per university rules as he was set to graduate. In June 2018, he was elected to the minor position of a precinct committee officer for the Whitman County, Washington Republican Party.Charlottesville Hate Marcher Elected by Republican Party On January 7, 2019, the Whitman County Republican Central Committee voted unanimously to eject Allsup from the party. Although he will officially keep the title of precinct committee officer, all of his power in that position has been stripped, including his voting right.  Early life and education  Allsup was born in Beaverton, Oregon on September 7, 1995. He graduated from Bothell High School in 2014, and then enrolled at Washington State University (WSU) in Pullman, Washington, graduating in 2017.Frej, Willie (June 5, 2018) \\"White Nationalist Who Marched In Charlottesville Elected To Local GOP Office\\" Huffington Post While attending WSU, he was president of WSU College Republicans and hosted events that brought Republican candidates such as Bill Bryant and Chris Vance to the university. Activities = President of the WSU's College Republicans = Allsup was elected president of the WSU's College Republicans chapter in 2015, and remained president until resigning on August 14, 2017. According to one student who attended meetings of the organisation, Allsup changed the nature of the group dramatically. In January 2017, Allsup arranged for Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at WSU, though the event was cancelled due to weather. The President of the WSU Young Democrats, Gavin Pielow, continued to host a \\"Civics 101\\" program that was planned as an \\"alternative event\\" to Yiannopolous' planned visit. As President of the College Republicans, Allsup consistently participated in public forum debates with his counterpart Pielow. In the spring of 2017, ASWSU Senator Kevin Schilling moderated a debate between Allsup and Pielow in which the two discussed Russia's involvement in President Donald Trump's Administration, Supreme Court confirmations, U.S. foreign policy, the proposed border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, the national budget, and health care. In 2016, Allsup served as the Washington coordinator for Students for Rand, the youth division of Rand Paul's presidential campaign. = Students for Trump = Following the suspension of Paul's campaign, Allsup was hired by Ryan Fournier to serve as the Senior Advisor at Students for Trump, a non-profit political organization based in Campbell, North Carolina supporting Donald Trump's presidential campaign, unaffiliated with the official campaign organization. Allsup helped to organize the May 9, 2016 construction of the \\"Trump Wall\\" at the University of Washington. The wall was and built out of plywood, painted to resemble a brick wall, with the phrases \\"Blue Lives Matter\\" and \\"Make America Great Again\\" painted on the front. The event, which was co-hosted by UW Students for Trump and UW College Republicans, was met with \\"about 100\\" protesters. Allsup stated that the intended message of the event was \\"that we need to have a strong immigration policy and enforce the law,\\" and regarding the exposure the event generated, that \\"the reason people demonstrate is for exposure, media or otherwise.\\" In January 2017, he attended an inauguration celebration outside the National Press Club in downtown Washington, D.C., where he stated he had been attacked by a protester with a flagpole. = Unite the Right rally and aftermath= Allsup attended the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville on August 12, 2017. At the rally, he documented events and delivered a speech defending the protesters there. Allsup was open about his participation in the rally, including his plan to speak, which was disrupted by protesters. On the Monday after the rally, he resigned from his position as head of the College Republicans group at WSU, a move he said he had been planned in advance but had subsequently expedited. In an interview with KREM, he said that he attended the rally \\"in a media capacity\\" and was unexpectedly asked to speak by one of its organizers. He also said that he disagreed with the violence that occurred there and with the hateful symbols, such as swastikas, that were being displayed by some of the rally's attendees. After attending the rally in Charlottesville, it was reported by unnamed sources that he uploaded a video documenting his experiences there that was almost immediately taken down. Images of Allsup attending the rally posted on social media led to demands on social media platforms that WSU expel Allsup, including a petition. Allsup stated on Twitter that if college administrators did expel him, it would result in a \\"huge civil rights lawsuit win for me.\\" As of the week of August 14, he was not enrolled in classes for the fall semester at WSU. =Election to local Republican Party position= In an uncontested election in June 2018, Allsup was elected to be the Precinct Committee Officer (PCO) for Precinct #129, a minor \\"hyperlocal\\" position of the Washington State Republican Party. PCOs elect the Republican leadership in their respective counties. Allsup was unopposed for the position and the party rules state that an unopposed candidate automatically wins. His election was criticized by many Republican leaders in Whitman County. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, Allsup's intentions have been to achieve his white nationalist anti-immigration agenda \\"through the infiltration of the Republican Party rather than by the radical, revolutionary action favored by vanguardist groups on the extreme fringe.\\" Allsup told a white nationalist podcast in 2017 \\"You have a seat at the table, and that’s the most important thing, getting that seat at the table, and you can get that seat at the table by, yes, showing up, yes, by bringing people in.\\" Keegan Hankes, a senior research analyst at the SPLC, commented that \\"Anytime that someone who holds extreme political positions has any foothold in mainstream politics, it’s a problem,\\" and pointed out that using uncontested elections to get a foot in the door has long been a strategy for white nationalists. On January 7, 2019, the Whitman County Republican Party Central Committee voted unanimously to eject Allsup from the party ranks. As his election for PCO was publicly held and the party is a private organization, they are unable to officially strip him of his title. He will remain a PCO but all of his powers have been taken away, including his right to vote within the party. Several party officials, including County Commissioners Art Swannack and Michael Largent, commented that Allsup was hardly a Republican. They pointed to the fact that Allsup himself has denied being a Republican. =Social media= Allsup's account on Twitter was suspended in December 2017. At the time he had amassed about 24,000 followers. In August 2019, Allsup's Instagram and Facebook accounts were deleted. According to Facebook, this was \\"for violating our policies against dangerous organizations and individuals\\". His YouTube channel was also demonetized around this time. Several days later, the channel was one of several which were deleted from YouTube by Google as part of a policy shift to remove content affiliated with white supremacy. At the time it was deleted, the channel had more than 450,000 subscribers. In September 2019, Allsup became a co-host for the Fash The Nation podcast hosted by The Right Stuff.  Views  Allsup has described himself as a \\"paleoconservative\\" and a \\"right- wing libertarian\\". He has been described as a white supremacist or white nationalist by many news outlets. The Southern Poverty Law Center lists him as an extremist and describes his ideology as alt-right and white nationalist. The Washington Post described him as a \\"budding alt-right figure\\" in 2017. He argues that he is not a white nationalist. Shortly after stepping down as president of the WSU College Republicans, he told KCPQ that \\"I have fully condemned the KKK, I have fully condemned Nazis, all of that kind of stuff.\\" = Support of Richard Lynn = In May 2017, Allsup expressed support for the views of psychologist Richard Lynn, a former professor at the University of Ulster known for his belief in racial differences in intelligence and the claim that black Africans have an average IQ of less than 70. Lynn used selective data by systematically ignoring Africans with high IQ scores, and there is no evidence to back up Lynn's claims.

Racing career =2015: two-year-old season= Ulysses made his racecourse debut on 23 October in a maiden race over one mile at Newbury Racecourse in which he started at odds of 4/1 and finished sixth of the fifteen runners, two and three quarter lengths behind the winner Algometer. =2016: three-year-old season= Ulysses began his second campaign by finishing second in a maiden race over ten furlongs at Leicester Racecourse in April and then started odds- on favourite for a similar event at Newbury on 13 May. Ridden by Ryan Moore, he took the lead three furlongs out and went clear of his ten opponents to win \\"very easily\\" by eight lengths. Such was the impression made by the colt's win at Newbury that Ulysses was regarded as a serious contender when he was stepped up sharply in class to contest the 2016 Epsom Derby on 4 June. He started the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting but never looked likely to win and tired in the closing stages to finish twelfth of the sixteen runners behind Harzand. The colt was off the course for over seven weeks before returning in the Group Three Gordon Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 27 July in which he started 9/2 second favourite behind his stablemate Platitude. Ridden by Andrea Atzeni he was restrained in the early stages but took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by half a length from the Aidan O'Brien-trained The Major General. Ulysses with Frankie Dettori At the end of August Ulysses started odds-on favourite for the Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor Racecourse but was unable to overhaul the four-year-old filly Chain of Daisies and was beaten a short head. The colt ended his second season with a journey to the California to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park on 5 November. Racing against world-class older horses he finished fourth behind Highland Reel, Flintshire and Found. =2017: four-year-old season= On his first appearance as a four-year-old, Ulysses was partnered by Atzeni in the Gordon Richards Stakes at Sandown Park on 28 April and started 3/1 second favourite behind My Dream Boat in a field which also included Royal Artillery (Rose of Lancaster Stakes) and Deauville (Belmont Derby). He was settled in sixth place before taking the lead a furlong out and won by a length from Deauville despite hanging left in the closing stages. In the Prince of Wales's Stakes Royal Ascot in June Ulysses took the lead a furlong out but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third behind Highland Reel and the Tattersalls Gold Cup winner Decorated Knight. Jim Crowley took the ride when Ulysses started at odds of 8/1 for the Eclipse Stakes on good to firm ground at Sandown on 8 July. The Derby runner-up Cliffs of Moher started favourite ahead of Barney Roy (St James's Palace Stakes) while the other six runners included Decorated Knight, Eminent (Craven Stakes, fourth in the Derby) and Lightning Spear (Celebration Mile). He was towards the rear or the field for most of the way as the outsider Taj Mahal set the pace, but began to make rapid progress on the outside in the straight. He went to the front a furlong out and fought off a persistent challenge from Barney Roy to prevail by a nose in a photo finish. Stoute, who was winning the race for a record sixth time commented \\"He's an admirable horse. He's only ever had one blip and that was in the Derby, when he got knocked over twice. He's very consistent, and today the first two came right away from the third\\". Three weeks after his win at Sandown Ulysses was stepped up in distance for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles on good to soft ground at Ascot. He proved no match for the three-year-old filly Enable but came home in second place, ahead of Idaho, Highland Reel, My Dream Boat and Jack Hobbs. In the International Stakes at York Racecourse on 23 August Ulysses started at odds of 4/1 in a seven-runner field. He faced several old rivals including Barney Roy, Cliffs of Moher, Decorated Knight and My Dream Boat but the favourite for the race was the 2000 Guineas winner Churchill. Crowley tracked the leaders before moving his mount forward to take the lead a furlong out. Ulysses stayed on strongly in the closing stages to win by two lengths and a neck from Churchill and Barney Roy. After the race Stoute said \\"We’ve become very fond of this horse. It all went so smoothly – there was never a blip. It was his best performance so far. It's now time to give him a break.\\" He went on to name the Breeders' Cup as the horse's likely end of year target. In late September it was announced that Ulysses would be retired from racing at the end of the season and would begin his career as a breeding stallion at the Cheveley Park Stud at Newmarket. Assessment and awards On 16 November 2017 at the Cartier Racing Awards, Ulysses was named Champion Older Horse. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Ulysses was rated the sixth-best horse in the world and the best older horse in Europe.

Situated just to the south of the village, the farmhouse is a Grade II* listed building. History The origins of the house are of about 1600. Sir Cyril Fox and Lord Raglan, who refer to the house as \\"Upper Tresenny\\" in their three-volume guide Monmouthshire Houses, consider that the style of the stone staircase supports this early dating. In about 1610, the parlour block was added to the existing hall block. Cadw records Fox and Raglan's explanation for the hiatus in building what was clearly intended as a single structure, namely that the 1600s house was constructed next to an earlier medieval hall house which was then demolished when the builders were ready to construct the adjacent parlour block. Further extensions were undertaken in the 17th century. The farmhouse remains a private residence. Architecture and description The architectural historian John Newman describes Great Tresenny as \\"a fine unmodernised farmstead\\". It is of two storeys with the hall to the north, parlour to the south, and service rooms in the centre. The partitions on the ground floor which were noted by Fox and Raglan are \\"no longer visible\\". The farmhouse is constructed of old red sandstone rubble which was once white-washed. Fox and Raglan note the exceptional height of the ground-floor rooms, indicating \\"the importance of the house\\" which is a Grade II* listed building.

It was fought between Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forces and those of the Iraqi government. Its first stage included clashes in the city from 11 to 18June. The second stage was fighting over the control of Baiji oil refinery from 18 to 21June. ISIL captured both the town and the refinery. On 19June 2014, the Iraqi Army retook the a refinery in a counter- attack. Fighting continued in Baiji until October 2014, when government forces finally established control, which they have maintained since.  Background  On 4June 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and its allies attacked Mosul launching their northern Iraq offensive. The following day, they started the Salahuddin campaign in Saladin. ISIL and its allies captured Mosul on 10June 2014. after a six-day battle. When the city fell, there were reports that the group was advancing from Mosul to Kirkuk. After capturing the city, the group freed nearly 1,000 prisoners. On 11June, ISIL and its allies also started the siege of Amirli.  The Battle  On 11June, around 60 ISIL vehicles entered the city of Baiji. They set the main court house and police station on fire. They also took control of Baiji prison and freed all 2,400 inmates. Later that day, the militants reportedly retreated from Baiji, before the Iraqi Army's Fourth Armored Division arrived in the city, allegedly due to persuasion from local tribal leaders. However, the next day it was confirmed ISIL was still in control of the town. On 18June, ISIL attacked the oil refinery near Baiji. An official inside the refinery stated the militants had captured 75 percent of the facility, while a military spokesman claimed the attack had been repelled, with 40 militants killed. On 19June, Iraqi government forces launched an counter-attack and claimed to have regained full control of the oil refinery after heavy fighting that left 100 militants dead. ISIL created watchtowers and checkpoints within Baiji. On 20June 2014, ISIL forces surrounded the refinery and attacked it for a second time, but failed to capture it. They launched a third attack on 21June, killing 36 Iraqi soldiers, but failed to recapture the refinery.  Aftermath  In the months following the battle, Iraq and ISIL continued fighting in the area. Control of Baiji switched between the two sides. The Iraqi government and the Popular Mobilization Forces retook Baiji in October 2015. Since then, the city has been under Iraqi control but has faced periodic ISIL attacks. The city's infrastructure has been severely damaged by the prolonged fighting.

The conflict started in early November 2008 when the Libyan Government stripped ethnic Toubous of their citizenship, claiming that their leaders had sided with their rival Chad. The clashes began when TFSL set a local government's office on fire. Following the incident the government dispatched army units and helicopters to the region, putting Kufra under siege. The clashes stopped in mid-November when both parties agreed to a cease-fire. On 20 November 2008, a Toubou tribal meeting with Libyan officials was held in Kufra to end the conflict, the conflict led to the deaths of 11 to 30 people, with over a hundred being wounded. Background After a successful coup d'etat led by Muammar Gaddafi in 1969, and the republic was established; Gaddafi like Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser an Arab nationalist started to arabise the country. A couple of months later a new law was passed which made Libya an Arab state and replaced it with the 1951 constitution. In the 1951 constitution states \\"Libyans shall be equal before the law\\" and also it also mentioned \\"shall enjoy equal civil and political rights without distinction of religion, belief, race, language, weight kinship, or political or social opinion.\\" Since then Arabic became the sole official language of Libya; both languages and cultures from minority groups like Aujila, Ghat, Ghadames, Hun, Imazighen, Jalo, Toubou, Socra and Zuwara peoples had no room in the country. Especially the Imazighen and the Toubou tribes who were persecuted and harassed by the regime. Until August 2007 a controversial law which bans Imazighen women giving birth to their children an Imazighen name.

It is not to be confused with Marsilea minuta E.Fourn. 1880, which is a synonym for Marsilea vestita. Other common names include gelid waterklawer, small water clover, airy pepperwort, and pepperwort, though the lattermost also applies to plants in the genus Lepidium. In French it is called ' (literally \\"four-leafed marsilea\\") and ' (literally \\"little Marsilea\\"), the latter appearing to be a calque with the Latin botanical name. In Chinese it is (), literally \\"southern field word grass,\\" referencing the similarity of the leaflet shape to the Chinese character for \\"field.\\" The Koch Rajbongshi people and Garo people call it '. It is called ('shushni shak') in Bengali. In parts of India it can be called ' In Indonesian it is ' (literally \\"clover\\"), but this name also applies to Marsilea crenata. In Japanese it is and in Thai it is . In Malaysian it is ' (literally \\"site duck\\"). In the Philippines it is ' (literally \\"so crowded\\"). Description M. minuta has a strongly variable appearance, which often leads to confusion with closely related species. In the water the plant is creeping and spreading, while on land it can appear cushion-like. It typically is perennial but sometimes appears annual. It is a tenagophyte, with the juvenile growing submerged and the adult typically terrestrial. It has a light brown to green rhizome that is thick with short tan hairs at the ends and internodal roots. The land leaves are on erect, terete, long petioles. The leaflets are by , mostly glabrous, cuneate or flabellate. The leaves in water are typically not floating, but emergent from the water. Fertile leaves are produced on land with up to four sporocarps each at penduncles near the base of the petiole. It has a small sporocarp that is long, wide, and thick. The sporocarp has a superior tooth at the apex of the stalk and an inferior tooth at the base. The sporocarp has a conspicuous long raphe, about ⅔ the length of the sporocarp and semi-terete. Unlike a few Marsilea species, M. minuta sporocarps mature above ground. Taxonomy M. minuta is thought to be closely related to Marsilea quadrifolia. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the genus Marsilea puts both in a widespread Old World subgroup also called \\"Marsilea\\" along with M. angustifolia, M. drummondii, M. crenata, and M. fadeniana and indicating that M. crenata is actually a synonym of M. minuta. Habitat and ecology Marsilea minuta can grow from sea level up to 1,950m in elevation in ponds and other shallow water. It can grow in fresh water or brackish water in clay or sandy soil. The plant can develop into large colonies, and can be weedy. Some of its preferred habitat is being lost to agriculture but as it readily grows in Paddy fields, drainage ditches, and other marginal areas its overall population is stable. It has the potential to be invasive and dispersal through aquarium trade and other human means should be limited. It is a native plant in the following countries: The leaves and sporocarps of M. minuta are eaten by many waterfowl species, and the intact sporocarps pass through undigested to be spread to new areas. Elophila responsalis also feeds on the leaves, but is not thought to do much damage to the plant. The plant is susceptible to herbicides such as bensulfuron-methyl, cinosulfuron, 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, oxyfluorfen, and paraquat. Otherwise it can tolerate high levels of organic pollution. Uses It is eaten in India, Sri Lanka, and in Bangladesh. In China it is used as forage. It has a raw protein content of 3.3%. The plant is used traditionally in China for edema, skin injuries, snakebite, and inflammation. In Mymensingh District it is traditionally used to treat cough, headache, hypertension, sleep disorders, and respiratory diseases. It is combined with Nardostachys jatamansi and after development by Asima Chatterjee sold as an ayurvedic treatment for epilepsy called \\"Ayush-56.\\" However, Ayush-56 does not show encouraging results in treating the disease. It is also used as a phytoremediator of arsenic while growing with rice plants.

Judith Love Cohen (1933–2016) was an American aerospace engineer and author. Cohen worked as an electrical engineer on the Minuteman missile, the science ground station for the Hubble Space Telescope, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, and the Apollo Space Program. After her retirement as an engineer, she founded a children's multimedia publishing company, eventually publishing more than 20 titles before her death in 2016.  Early life  Cohen was born in 1933 in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Sarah (Roisman) and Morris Bernard Cohen. By fifth grade, Cohen's classmates were paying her to do their math homework. Cohen was often the only female in her math classes, and decided she wanted to be a math teacher. By age 19, she was both studying engineering in college, and dancing ballet in the Metropolitan Opera Ballet company in New York.  Education  Judith received a scholarship to Brooklyn College to major in math, but realized she preferred engineering. After two years at Brooklyn College, Cohen married and moved to California, working as a junior engineer for North American Aviation, attending USC at night; she said that she went through both her BS and MS programs at USC without ever meeting another female engineering student. She received both her Bachelor's and master's degrees from USC Viterbi School of Engineering, and continued her association with the university, serving as an Astronautical Engineering Advisory board member. In 1982, Cohen became a graduate of the UCLA Engineering Executive Program as well.  Professional life  Cohen's engineering career began in 1952, when she worked as a junior engineer at North American Aviation. After graduation from USC Viterbi School of Engineering in 1957, she went on to work at Space Technology Laboratories. Space Technology Laboratories eventually became TRW (acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2002). Cohen stayed with the company until her retirement in 1990. In 1990, after retiring from practice as an engineer, Cohen began a publishing company called Cascade Pass with her 3rd husband, David Katz. They published two series of books: (a) the \\"You Can be a Woman … \\" series was created to encourage very young girls to pursue careers in science and engineering; (b) the \\"Green\\" series focuses on promoting positive environmental practices, aimed at young children. Cascade Pass has sold more than 100,000 of their children's books in these two series. Cascade Pass also published a book called The Women of Apollo (written by Robyn Friend), which features short biographies of four women who helped put the first man on the moon, Judith among them. In May 2014, Cohen received the IEEE-USA Distinguished Literary Contributions Award for her work with STEM for children.  Personal life  Cohen was the mother of four children, including well-known engineer/scientist Neil Siegel and actor Jack Black. She had her first three (Neil, Howard, and Rachel) with Bernard Siegel, who she met in college and married a few months later. Cohen and Siegel divorced in the 1960s, and Cohen later married Thomas William Black. Her fourth child, Jack, was born in 1969. Cohen and Black divorced in the late 1970s. Her third husband was David Katz. They were still married when Cohen died of cancer in 2016.  Books written by Judith Love Cohen  A Cleaner Port. A Brighter Future.

Life Gaura Devi was born in 1925 in a village named Lata in the state of Uttarakhand. She moved to a nearby village named Reni by the Alaknanda River. By the age of 22 she was a widow with a child. Her new village was near to the border with Tibet. Gaura Devi was elected to lead the Mahila Mangal Dal (Women's Welfare Association) in the wake of the Chipko movement. The organization worked on the protection of community forests. Birth of Chipko Gaura Devi came to notice in 1974 when she was told that local loggers were cutting the trees on 25 March by a young girl. The men of Reni village had been tricked out of the village by news that the government was going to pay out compensation for land used by the army. It fell to Gaura Devi and 27 other women to tackle the loggers. She challenged the men to shoot her instead of cutting down the trees and she described the forest with her maika (mother's house). They managed to halt their work by hugging the trees despite the abuse of the armed loggers. They kept guard of the trees that night and over the next three or four days other villages and villagers joined the action. The loggers left leaving the trees.Chipko 30th Anniversary The Nanda Devi Campaign.Chipko! – Hill conservationists Tehelka, 11 September 2004. After this incident, the Uttar Pradesh Government established a committee of experts to investigate the issue of felling of trees, and the lumber company withdrew its men from Reni. The committee stated that the Reni forest was an ecologically sensitive area and that no trees should be felled there. Thereafter the government of Uttar Pradesh placed a 10-year ban on all tree- felling in an area of over 1150 km². Gaura Devi died in July 1991, at the age of 66.

Description  The encyclopedia, which discusses both painting and sculpture, traces the critical profiles of artists who have characterized twentieth century Italian art. The content is organized on a biographical basis, although the text is composed of historical-themed chapters and not individual entries. The distribution of content between the various volumes takes place on a generational basis: each volume deals with facts and personalities that have characterized the different generations of artists, divided by decades: from the \\"Historical Masters generation\\" (of which the personalities born in the course Of the nineteenth century but still active in the twentieth century) comes the \\"forties generation\\" (of which artists born between 1940 and 1949). This entirely peculiar setting has the advantage of creating in the vast biographical panorama the analyzed criteria for distinguishing and organizing objective and controlled content.  Drafting  In Geneva, at the beginning of the 1980s, Genoa began writing what later became volumes 4, 5 and 6 on three exhibitions on Italian artists born in the twenties (1981), ten years (1982) and First decade (1985) of the twentieth century. Since 1993, publisher Bora of Bologna has started publishing encyclopedia volumes. In 1999 Di Genova was among the founders of MAGI '900, the museum in Pieve di Cento, which aims to set up an anthological collection of 20th century Italian art, becoming the museum's equivalent to the encyclopedic contents of the History of Art.  Contents  The work is divided into seven volumes. It features fivethousand artists, with over thirty-five thousand names listed in the analytical index. There are reproductions, in color and black and white, of about tenthousand works.

Mutations in PI3K signalling pathways are common in human tumours, and the William lab focuses on how they contribute to oncogenesis and how pharmaceuticals can specifically target these pathways. The Williams group has shown how conformational changes in the p110 alpha isoform accompanies its activation on cell membranes, and established that oncogenic mutations activate PI3Ks by mimicking or enhancing these conformational changes.

The case remained unsolved until 2015, when new advancements in genealogical DNA research led to the arrest of Ahmed Chelh Gerj, a Moroccan-Spanish citizen who moved to France in 1999. While it was unsolved, the case was popularly known in Spain as the Eva Blanco Case (Caso Eva Blanco), the Crime of Algete (Crimen de Algete) and Operation Gang (Operación Pandilla), the code name given to the investigation by the Spanish Civil Guard. Disappearance Blanco played tennis with her friends during the afternoon of April 19. At night, the group stayed in a local disco until 23:30, when they prepared to return home. Blanco, who had agreed to return at midnight, was among the first to separate from the rest. A female friend accompanied her to a vacant lot some 700 meters from Blanco's home in the Valderrey residential area, before they parted ways at 23:45. Blanco intended to walk across the vacant lot as a shortcut to her home, avoiding a longer detour through the town center, but she never reached her destination. The same shortcut was used by her and other Valderrey students regularly to get to high school. Because Blanco had always been on time before, her mother became worried and she called Blanco's friends, who told her that she had already left. She alerted her husband, a tow truck driver, who searched for her in the town with the help of his nephew, a local police officer, and the father of one of Blanco's friends. Finding no trace of her, the parents reported her disappearance at the local Civil Guard station at 1:00 AM, but the officers were apathetic about filing a disappearance after little over an hour. The guard at the door even said that kids of her age were all on drugs and she was probably lying in some doorway. By 2:30, Blanco's family, friends, Civil Guards and the local police began her search in Algete and the area leading to nearby Fuente el Saz de Jarama, although a missing report wasn't filed by the Civil Guard until 8:00. At 12:00, the family contacted the regional TV station Telemadrid and requested its help publicizing the case. Blanco's father visited the local Civil Guard station fifteen times during the night and criticized the institution for not searching the rural roads or using vehicles in the search before sunrise, except for a short 20 minutes run around Valderrey. He claimed that they did not do it earlier because they did not have the gas. The Civil Guard denied the accusation and said that it was customary to wait some hours between a missing person report and its search. Early murder investigation =Discovery of the body= Blanco's body was found by two elderly Ajalvir residents at 9:00 AM, next to a road construction site between Cobeña and Belvis de Jarama, six kilometers away from Algete. The discoverers thought that she might have been run over by a car, but the Civil Guard noticed that the victim, lying face down on the ground, had actually been stabbed several times on the back while she tried to run away from an attacker. The body was dressed with the same jeans, dark sweater and mountain boots that Blanco was wearing when she disappeared, with only one sleeve of her jacket taken off. Both killer and victim were also assumed to have reached the area in a vehicle, although abundant rain in the night of the murder had washed out any tire tracks and most other forensic evidence. Nevertheless, some footprints from the victim and a man wearing size 42 moccasins survived. The Civil Guard notified Blanco's family of the discovery at 15:30. The news caused commotion in Algete, a town of just 12,300 people,with no recent instances of violent crime. At 19:00, 200 people gathered silently before Blanco's home to condemn her murder. Blanco's funeral on April 23 was attended by 2,000 people. =Autopsy report= Blanco was stabbed in the back 19 times before dying from blood loss around 4:00 AM. The murder weapon was a navaja between 8 and 10 centimeters long and 1 cm wide. The first stab to the side of the body was made while she was sitting in a vehicle and the rest after she exited it and tried to run up the slope next to the road. Many of these later wounds, mostly found on Blanco's ear and back of the head, were superficial and interpreted as \\"passionate,\\" while the first injury was deep and may have been fatal even in the absence of all others. Blanco's hymen was torn and the same man's semen was found in her mouth, vagina and underwear. A red fiber was also retrieved from Blanco's mouth, and subsequently identified by the Catalonia Textile Museum and Documentation Centre as belonging to a common type of car upholstery, confirming that Blanco had been in a vehicle after her disappearance. =First theories= Because the body was found dressed and showed no previous signs of violence, both coroner and officers believed that the sex had been consensual and that the murder was the result of an argument after. In contrast, Blanco's parents thought that their daughter had been kidnapped and raped at knifepoint, then murdered to avoid prosecution for the previous crime. The Civil Guard initially believed that the case would be closed after a short investigation. The dominant theory was that a single person known to Blanco had approached her in a car, offered her a ride which she accepted, and took her to the construction site, a known lovers lane, where they had sex before she was murdered. The first suspect was Blanco's ex- boyfriend, a resident of Fuente el Saz who had recently broken up with her. However, he was ruled out after being questioned by police. Afterward, the investigation centered on adult men known to Blanco's family and that she might trust. On May 29, the government announced that the Civil Guard found the case more complicated than expected and that it no longer excluded a stranger as the perpetrator. Blanco's friends claimed that she would never accept a ride from a stranger and that she must have been forced into the car. Other neighbors linked the crime to a strange blue car seen in the town following another girl around midnight, one of whose occupiers was a blonde man around twenty years old. However, nobody recorded the car's plates. The existence of semen was kept from Blanco's family and the public while the officers retrieved DNA samples from Blanco's male relatives and acquittances, all in secret, and compared it to the semen's DNA. Blanco's father's sample was extracted from a cigarette that he had smoked and left behind while drinking coffee and discussing the case with Civil Guard officers; others were taken under the guise of unrelated blood alcohol content tests or from cups and glasses used in bars. Although no matches were made, the Civil Guard remained convinced that the killer was an adult male resident in Algete or a nearby town. ='Secret diaries'= Eight months after the crime, Blanco's mother found two notebooks hidden between drawers in her daughter's room. They were labeled \\"95-96\\" and \\"96-97\\", and were handwritten by the victim until the day of her murder. Many of these pages contained nothing but \\"Eva and Miguel\\", the name of her ex-boyfriend, repeated over and over in different pen colors. Two pages before the last one's end, however, \\"Eva and Miguel\\" were replaced by \\"Eva and 343110\\". All attempts to discover the meaning of \\"343110\\" were unsuccessful, with some hypothesis revolving around the fact that \\"34\\" is the phone prefix of Spain, and \\"110\\" is Algete's postal code. Blanco's father believed that it was the number of a pager given in a Coca-Cola promotion at the time, while others believed that it was a coded name. =Proposed mass DNA test= After being informed that his DNA had been compared to semen found in his daughter's body and excluded him as a suspect, Blanco's father began to campaign for other Algete residents to provide voluntary DNA samples in an effort to help catch his daughter's killer. In this project he was backed by Algete's Mayor, Jesús Herrera Fernández (PSOE), who made an official announcement in November 1999, petitioning all male residents of Algete over 16 years of age (est. 5,000) to provide voluntary hair or saliva samples if they wished to. The proposition was unanimously rejected by Spanish judicial organizations who considered it \\"simple-minded,\\" \\"disproportionate,\\" \\"useless,\\" and a potential stigma for Algete residents who refused to provide a DNA sample without court order and were in their legal right to do so. Nevertheless, Blanco's father received 2,013 samples from residents of Algete and nearby towns and deposited them in the local courthouse until it was decided what to do with them. The case's examining magistrate requested a report from Madrid's chief prosecutor on the legal feasibility of such test. The response, issued on March 30, 2000, was that testing should only be done on samples of people who could be deemed suspicious according to the investigation, and not just volunteers. Only samples from 45 people were tested, including 12 relatives of Blanco on her father's side, six on her mother's side, her acquittances and any people with a previous criminal record, with special attention to cases of sexual misconduct and knife violence. New evidence and renewed media interest By 2007, 30 officers had worked in the case and information on similar cases had been requested from other law enforcement offices including the Ertzaintza and the FBI. A specialist from the University of Santiago de Compostela re-examined the DNA evidence and concluded that it belonged to a man not of European descent. Six years later, in 2013, the number of people investigated had risen to 1,503, and 208 men from Algete and other towns had had their DNA tested, including criminals who were on leave at the time of the murder. A new examining magistrate allowed the opening and checking of the 2,013 envelopes containing the names of the volunteers from 1999, but not the testing of all DNA samples. =Eva: Un expediente abierto= On April 26, 2013 La Sexta's investigative show Equipo de Investigación aired a program about the case with the title Eva: Un expediente abierto (\\"Eva: A cold case\\"). The program recapitulated the known evidence and included interviews with Blanco's parents, friends, teachers, officers working on the case and Vicente Garrido Genovés, a psychologist and criminologist who gained notoriety when he helped identify serial killer Joaquín Ferrándiz Ventura in Castellón in 1998. Garrido disagreed with the Civil Guard's theory that the murderer was a \\"secret boyfriend\\" of Blanco, arguing that she would not agree to meet a lover 15 minutes before her curfew because of the risk of exposing such relationship. His criminal profile was a stalker who was not known or barely known to Blanco. The lack of defensive wounds could be explained because of the victim being threatened before agreeing to have sex with the attacker. The criminal would be of low intelligence, uneducated, with a low-skilled profession and emotionally immature, since he sought sex with a teenager rather than a woman closer in age. He probably had no family because they would have noticed him coming late and inquired him about it. It was also possible that he continued his criminal career elsewhere in Spain and that he was in prison for other attacks. =Facial composite= A Spanish Renault 18. After watching the program, a woman reported to authorities that she had seen a suspicious man in the road construction site around 8:00 AM. He was walking in the rain with no umbrella, looked like he had not slept during the night, and appeared to be looking for something before he got in a white Renault 18. The Civil Guard deemed the testimony reliable, in part because a Renault 18 had been reported by other witnesses over the years and the model was compatible with the fiber retrieved from Blanco's body. On October 28, 2013 the Civil Guard released a facial composite made in collaboration with the new witness. The suspect was a man who was between 35 and 40 years old in 1997; 1'70 to 1'80 meters tall; corpulent, between 75 and 80 kg; with short, spiky, brown hair; square and hardened face; dark, sunken eyes; wore a white shirt and a V-neck sweater; and drove a white Renault 18 with red upholstery. A confidential phone number and e-mail address were created for possible tips. By January 1, 2014, 100 e-mails had been received. Arrest of Ahmed Chelh Gerj =Identification= At the end of 2013, a new revision of the semen's DNA narrowed the identity of the donor to a man of North African descent. The Civil Guard petitioned the 300 North African men resident in Algete in 1997 to provide voluntary samples. Their response was overwhelmingly positive, even though many had left the town and even the country in the intervening years. Fouad Chelh, a former resident of Blanco's neighborhood now living in southern France, shared his Y chromosome and over 97% of his nuclear DNA with the killer. This was only possible if both men were siblings. After the sample of a brother of Chelh living in Murcia and who had never resided in Algete provided an identical result, a European arrest warrant was issued for the third Chelh brother, Ahmed Chelh Gerj. On October 1, 2015 Ahmed was arrested outside his workplace in Besançon, France during a joint intervention of the Civil Guard and the French Gendarmerie. =Suspect= Ahmed Chelh Gerj, 52, was born in Taza, Morocco on March 1, 1963. He was 34 years old at the time of the murder. Chelh married in Madrid to a 20-year old Spanish woman in 1989 and became a Spanish citizen in the 1990s. They had three children in 1989, 1993 and 1997. His wife was five months pregnant with their third child when Blanco was murdered. The Chelhs were never listed as residents of Algete because they lived in a caravan parked in a plant nursery where Chelh worked as a deliveryman, and which had been lent to them by Chelh's employer. Chelh's residence, next to the Paracuellos de Jarama-Fuente el Saz road, was four kilometers away from the murder scene. The Chelhs moved to France in 1999. Though they continued to be listed as married in Spain, they separated amicably and Chelh remarried to a 24-year-old Moroccan student in Besançon in 2003. Chelh and his new wife settled in Pierrefontaine-les-Varans, a village 20 kilometers from the Swiss border, and had two children that were six-years-old and an infant at the time of his arrest. While in France, he worked as a welder for a farm machinery company and his relationship with coworkers was reputed to be poor. When told about the DNA evidence, Chelh claimed that he had gone out for a walk alone and that two unidentified men had grabbed him, brought him to Blanco's body and forced him to masturbate over it. His ex-wife, however, told journalists that he had left in the company of his brothers, as they used to do in the weekends. She claimed that none ever told her about that night until after Chelh's arrest, when a brother said that they had been at the same disco as Blanco, and that they talked to her after she had an argument with her ex- boyfriend. Blanco left the disco with the brothers at one point, but she went back inside with her friends around 23:00. Chelh's ex-wife also claimed that neither the police nor the Civil Guard had ever interrogated her or the brothers in the course of the investigation. Both her and her youngest son denied that Chelh had ever mistreated them, but she later admitted that Chelh became aggressive when he drank. Blanco's family never met Chelh and they interacted sporadically with his brother at most. A former coworker at the plant nursery described Chelh as not very social, aggressive after drinking, and \\"a little pervy\\" with women. Former female customers also remembered him as \\"a pervert, the kind that makes you feel bad when he's near.\\" =Prosecution= On October 5, Chelh unsuccessfully tried to cut his jugular vein with a small glass in his cell, yet he accepted to be deported to Spain to stand trial two days later. On October 9, Chelh landed in Torrejón Air Base under the custody of the Civil Guard. At the preliminary hearing on October 13, Chelh declined to make a statement but he agreed to give a DNA sample, following the advice of his lawyer in both cases. He was formally charged with murder, rape, and illegal detention, and was recluded in Soto del Real prison pending trial, after a request from his lawyer to release him until the DNA results came in was denied. Testing confirmed Chelh as the origin of the incriminating semen beyond doubt. On October 19, Chelh's defence unsuccessfully requested his release pending trial. Chelh's lawyer argued that there was no evidence tying his client to the crime besides DNA, that the hypothesis worked for the past 18 years by the Civil Guard was that Blanco had willingly boarded the car of an adult known to her, and that she had consensual sex before she was killed, according to the same investigation. As a result, it either made no sense to charge Chelh with rape, or to believe that Blanco would have agreed to get in a car with a Moroccan, given her friends' insistence that she would never board the car of a stranger. The lawyer claimed that Blanco would never go willingly with a Moroccan because she harbored neonazi sympathies, as indicated by imagery present in her diaries, and reminded that the investigation had focused early on the neonazi group Bases Autónomas. Blanco's friends denied that she had any relation with neonazis. Chelh's first wife fueled the conspiracy theory in an interview with TVE's La Mañana, where she claimed that there were \\"several people involved\\" and that the Chelhs knew who was \\"behind it all\\", \\"more or less.\\" She claimed this time that Chelh came back home between 22:00 and 23:00, that he wouldn't stay out late because she was pregnant, and that he told her that some boys had mugged him, but that he didn't want to denounce it because he was afraid. On January 8, 2016 a team of prison psychiatrists and psychologists supported the lifting of anti-suicide measures placed on Chelh since his arrest, as he had repeatedly requested himself. At the next hearing on January 15, Chelh claimed that two people forced him into a car and threatened him with a navaja in order to make him ejaculate over Blanco, who was inside alive. He insisted that he never penetrated her, but when asked why his semen was found inside the body, he couldn't answer. =Death= On January 29, Chelh was found dead in his cell at Alcalá-Meco prison, having hanged himself with his shoelaces. The prosecution was formally ended on February 15.
