Yardangs in the Qaidam Desert, Qinghai Province, China. A yardang is a streamlined protuberance carved from bedrock or any consolidated or semiconsolidated material by the dual action of wind abrasion by dust and sand, and deflation which is the removal of loose material by wind turbulence.Desert Processes Working Group: Yardangs Yardangs become elongated features typically three or more times longer than wide, and when viewed from above, resemble the hull of a boat. Facing the wind is a steep, blunt face that gradually gets lower and narrower toward the lee end. Yardangs are formed by wind erosion, typically of an originally flat surface formed from areas of harder and softer material. The soft material is eroded and removed by the wind, and the harder material remains. The resulting pattern of yardangs is therefore a combination of the original rock distribution, and the fluid mechanics of the air flow and resulting pattern of erosion. Names The word itself is of Turkic origin,\\"yardang.\\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. Merriam-Webster, 2002. web link\\"yardang.\\" Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1).

Other names for them are \\"mud-lions\\",Ralph Bagnold, 1939.Farouk El-Baz, in an entry for \\"Yardangs of the Western Desert of Egypt\\" in The Geology of Egypt: An Annotated Bibliography (1984) (p. 374), writes, \\"Wind has sculpted the exceptional yardang, or mud lion, form.\\" \\"mushroom rocks\\", \\"sphinx-like hills\\", \\"koukour\\" in Tunisia, and \\"kalut\\" (Persian for \\"ridge\\") in Iran. The massive features of mega-yardangs are called \\"ridges and corridors\\" (') in French. Description A yardang is formed in cohesive material.Goudie, A.S. 2007. Mega-yardangs: A global analysis. Geography Compass 1(1):65-81, Hedin first found the wind- sculptured \\"clay terraces\\" or yardangs in the dried up riverbed of the Kurruk- daria in Central Asia. However, yardangs can be found in most deserts across the globe.Blackwelder, E. 1930. \\"Yardang and zastruga\\". Science 72(1868):396-397. Depending upon the winds and the composition of the weakly indurated deposits of silt and sand from which they are carved, yardangs may form very unusual shapes ‚Äî some resemble various objects or even people. Yardangs come in a large range of sizes, and are divided into three different categories: mega-yardangs, meso-yardangs, and micro-yardangs. Mega-yardangs can be several kilometers long and hundreds of meters high and are found in arid regions with strong winds; meso-yardangs are generally a few meters high and 10 to 15 meters long and are commonly found carved in semiconsolidated playa sediments and other soft granular materials; and micro-yardangs are only a few centimeters high. A large concentration of mega-yardangs occurs near the Tibesti Mountains in the central Sahara. There is a famous yardang at Hole in the Rock in Papago Park in Phoenix, Arizona, a rock formation with a roughly circular hole in it. Another yardang in Arizona is Window Rock, near the town of Window Rock. It is a 60-meter sandstone hill with a very large circular hole in the middle of it. Some geologists have suggested that the Great Sphinx of Egypt is an augmented yardang.Goodchild, J.G. 1898. Desert conditions in Britain. Transactions of the Geological Society of Glasgow 11(1):71-104. (See page 77) Yardangs in Lucus Planum (Mars) Pictures from Mars show that the yardang ridges occur on a massive scale there; some individual ridges are tens of kilometers long with intervening valleys nearly 1 km wide. Yardangs on Mars are typically found in the Amazonis region but the best ones are found in the equatorial region. Yardangs on Mars demonstrate that much of the eolian erosion is recent since they are sculpted in young geologic units. SAO/NASA ADS Astronomy Abstract Service: Yardangs on Mars Formation Yardangs are formed in environments where water is scarce and the prevailing winds are strong, uni-directional, and carry an abrasive sediment load. The wind cuts down low-lying areas into parallel ridges which gradually erode into separate hills that take on the unique shape of a yardang. This process yields a field of yardangs of roughly the same size, commonly referred to as a fleet due to their resemblance to the bottoms of ships. Alternatively, one can be formed by the migration of a dune that leaves behind a cemented core. As the process of formation continues, typically a trough will form around the base of the yardang. Most yardang fields are in sand-poor areas, but the associated troughs, especially in grooved terrain, may be invaded by sand. Sometimes this sand will accumulate to build shallow moats around the bottom. They are more commonly created from softer rock types like siltstone, sandstone, shale and limestone, but have also been observed in crystalline rocks such as schist and gneiss.

In fact, the name comes from the way in which the band moves between formations - members run to each form without using a predescribed path; this is known as scrambling or, in the western half of the United States, scattering. Characteristics Scramble bands often take pride in their diversion from the normal marching band. In fact, most scramble bands do not march at all, regardless of whether their official group name contains a form of the word \\"March\\". Like their marching counterparts, scramble bands almost always perform music using traditional band instruments. They will also stand in formations on a field, but that is usually where the similarity between scramble bands and typical marching bands end. The formations themselves are often simple shapes or crude \\"pictures\\" that lend themselves to a particular section of the performance instead of intricate geometric or abstract shapes. Additionally, scramble band performances often rely on a humorous or satirical script, read during the performance by an announcer using a loudspeaker or public address system. Scramble bands are generally student-run and tend to be smaller in membership than what one would expect from a marching band. The Columbia University Marching Band (CUMB) during the Cornell vs Columbia game at Wien Stadium, November 17, 2018. According to the self-described \\"Cleverest Band in the World\\" at Columbia University, the origin of scramble bands is as follows: :\\"See, in the 50s, our great country was going through a lot of changes. Disco was at its peak, little Shirley Temple was charming the hearts of Americans everywhere, Jesus was walking the earth, and Ronald Reagan was pushing hard for the new Women's suffrage movement. The Columbia University Marching Band, which had always been slightly wacky, took a good look at itself. \\"How,\\" we asked ourselves, \\"could we make being in a marching band even more fun?\\" Well, we decided that the whole marching around and forming rhombi thing had gone out of style with World War II. So we introduced the world to the \\"scramble band\\" concept - so named for the way bandies would scramble from one interesting formation to the next.\\" However, there is no widespread agreement as to which school actually invented the scramble band concept. The Harvard University Band lays a significant claim to the title with proof of scrambling as early as The Game (Harvard-Yale), November 23, 1946, as well as spelling \\"Keep 'em Flying\\" for the Navy and forming an airplane with the drum major twirling his baton as the propeller in 1941.http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hub/history/1940.shtml With Guy Slade as director, baton twirler, and drill master, 74 letters were spelled during the 1930 football season, 29 at the Harvard-Yale game alone. The word \\"Welcome\\" was learned and formed in five minutes at a stadium game with Michigan.http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hub/history/1930.shtml Other characteristics of scramble bands vary by the particular group and may include: *Non-standard instrumentation - Some bands include string or electronic sections to offer membership to musicians who would otherwise be excluded from participation in a marching band. Instruments in this category might include violins, cellos, string bass, electronic keyboards, and electric guitar. More unusual instrumentation such as bagpipes and accordions is not unheard of. For example, the Princeton University Band included an accordion, a bagpipe, two violins (acoustic), an electric guitar, and an electric bass in the 2005-06 school year, and has also featured a set of plastic flamingos and a pair of plastic pumpkins. The Michigan Technological University Huskies Pep Band contains instruments not normally seen in a pep band setting such as violins, violas, oboes, and bassoons, and unusual instruments such as piccolo trumpets, a valve trombone, a soprano trombone, and a contra-alto clarinet. The Columbia University Marching Band includes a six foot bench stolen from the University of Pennsylvania stands. *Non-musicians - Just as membership often includes non-standard instrumentalists, it may also include people who have little or no musical talent at all. These members may \\"play\\" homemade instruments (washboards, trash can lids, mailboxes, toasters, an oven, etc.) or may participate in other various capacities. They are usually known as \\"miscies,\\" while at Princeton they are known as \\"garbussion,\\" a portmanteau of \\"garbage\\" and \\"percussion.\\" More skilled bands can have people with high levels of musical talent playing unusual instruments. The Stanford Band, for example, has \\"mugs\\" with sometimes up to a decade of musical education playing instruments such as a kitchen sink or satellite dish. *Skits or other dramatic performance - Members may dress in costume and/or employ the use of props (usually handmade) to mime to the audience a scene described or suggested by the announcer's script. Such scenes are often overdramatic (to aid audience members seated far away) and make use of slap-stick comedy, where appropriate (or not). Members of the Yale Precision Marching Band who act on the field are called \\"squids.\\" Particular ensembles This style is practiced mainly by a number of college marching bands, primarily in academically elite or liberal arts schools such as the Ivy League colleges (excepting Cornell University; the Cornell Big Red Marching Band performs in the corps style seen in more traditional bands); Rice University Marching Owl Band (known by its acronym, The MOB); Stanford; Villanova; William & Mary; Humboldt State Marching Lumberjacks; and DePauw University. Besides school scatter bands, there are other traditional arenas for similar comic treatments of outdoor marching music, such as mummers parades, the pre-Rose-Parade parody known as The Doo Dah Parade, Chinatown parades, Mardi Gras parades, etc. Stunts, antics, and tomfoolery Scramble bands are notorious for their irreverent stunts, and some of these prove to be controversial. The most upsetting events usually have consequences (see also: censorship) regardless of whether the band intended such controversy. Listed below are some of the more notable events in scramble band lore: *The Princeton University Band was attacked by a group of cadets at The Citadel prior to a football game on September 20, 2008, while marching around the campus. Several Citadel officials apologized for the altercation, including The Citadel's President Lt. Gen. John W. Rosa and the student body president; no action was taken by either school against the Band. (The incident ultimately did not prevent The Citadel from visiting Princeton for a football game in September 2009; that game went on without incident from either side.) *Columbia's altar-boy joke (tuition going down faster than...) at halftime of a football game against Fordham, a nearby Catholic school. *UVa's Inbred Family Feud gag against West Virginia. This was one of the events which ultimately led to the athletic department barring the band from attending all revenue sports in 2003. *The Stanford Band accidentally rushed the field during the Big Game against rival Cal, mistakenly believing the game was over. This memorable accident became known as The Play, and is often seen on highlight reels. The field invasion prompted Cal announcer Joe Starkey to famously shout, \\"The band is on the field!\\" *More recently, Stanford's band was disciplined for a show with jokes about polygamy during a game against Brigham Young University in September 2004. *The Rice University MOB (Marching Owl Band) launched a weather balloon-based \\"UFO\\", eventually tracked by bewildered air traffic controllers. *Yale was banned from West Point because of the nature of the script to be performed that day. The YPMB responded the following year at Yale, with a halftime show where band members sarcastically announced, \\"We are all Americans and we are all the same.\\" *Another Yale halftime featured the marriage of two former band members. (\\"At Yale, Wedding Band Takes On a New Meaning\\", New York Times, October 10, 1992.) *Dartmouth was banned from Holy Cross for a show that involved a Ted Kennedy Triathlon which included the \\"Ted Kennedy drive and swim,\\" a parody of the Chappaquiddick affair. Members of the Kennedy family were in attendance, and needless to say, were not pleased. The Dartmouth Band was allowed back for the first time in 2004, but did not attend due to a limited travel budget. *The Lady Godiva Memorial Bnad , made up of engineering students at the University of Toronto, attended the Bloor-Danforth subway opening on February 26, 1966, and \\"leapt over turnstiles\\", with 400 students piling onto a train. One student then pulled the emergency power switch, interfering with regular service for more than 5 hours on the first day of the subway line's operation. *Michigan Technological University's Huskies Pep Band is banned from playing at rival school Northern Michigan University's campus, allegedly due to taking away home field advantage.http://www.pasty.com/discuss/messages/994/1553.html?WednesdayFebruary1620050112pm The Huskies Pep Band is one of the largest student organizations at the university, with more than 100 students on its active roster. During a 2004 Grand Valley State-Michigan Tech football game at Ann Arbor's Big House, the band performed a Monty Python halftime show, where they played a rendition of Every Sperm is Sacred while forming an egg that was then fertilized by a sousaphonist sperm.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8UKE6v_tmg Occasionally, the tables are turned. The Texas A & M Aggies misinterpreted a 1973 performance of Rice's Marching Owl Band and formed an angry mob outside Rice's own stadium, trapping the Owl band inside for hours until police dispersed some of the crowd and allowed the band to exit, transported by food service trucks. (The entire show can be found here .) Censorship In recent years, administrators at many schools have taken steps to rein in their scramble bands' more embarrassing attempts at humor. These have included: *Requiring approval of show contenthttp://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/02/25/marching- to-their-own-beat-band-carves-out-niche/ *Replacing student leaders with university faculty or staff *Refusing to allow the band to perform (a step occasionally also taken by a host school during away games) *Dissolution of the band  References  *\\"Engineers pull a slow one.\\" The Ubyssey.

The short story first appeared in Omni magazine in May 1981,. and was subsequently included in 1986's Burning Chrome, a collection of Gibson's short fiction. It takes place in the world of Gibson's cyberpunk novels, predating them by some years, and introduces the character Molly Millions, who plays a prominent role in Gibson's Sprawl trilogy of novels. The film plot differs considerably from the short story, and a novelization of William Gibson's screenplay written by Terry Bisson was published in 1995 under the title of Johnny Mnemonic. In 1996 a film tie-in edition of Gibson's original short story was published as a standalone book. Plot summary \\"Johnny Mnemonic\\" is a data trafficker who has undergone cybernetic surgery to have a data storage system implanted in his head. The system allows him to store digital data too sensitive to risk transmission on computer networks. To keep the cargo secure, the data is locked by a password known only to the intended recipient. Johnny enters a trance-like state while the data is being transferred or the password is being set, making him unaware of the contents and unable to retrieve them. He makes a modest living in the Sprawl by physically transporting sensitive information for corporations, underworld crime rings or wealthy individuals. As the story opens, Johnny has arranged to meet with his most recent customer, Ralfi Face, at the Drome bar. Ralfi is overdue to retrieve the hundreds of megabytes of data he has stored in Johnny's head. To add to his troubles, Johnny has learned that Ralfi has placed a contract on him, although the reasons are unclear. Johnny finds Ralfi at his usual table, accompanied by his bodyguard Lewis. Johnny threatens them with a sawed-off shotgun in his bag, but Lewis incapacitates him with a neural disruption device hidden under the table. Ralfi reveals that the data was, unknown to him at the time, stolen from the Yakuza, who are very interested in ensuring it is not revealed. Johnny is rescued by Molly, a \\"Razorgirl\\" who has undergone extensive body modifications, most notably razor-sharp blades under her fingers. She joins the action at the table, looking for a job. When Lewis tries to attack her, she cuts his wrist tendons and takes the incapacitating control device from him. Ralfi offers to pay her off, but she turns off the device and frees Johnny. Johnny immediately offers a higher bid to hire her as a bodyguard. Johnny and Molly take Ralfi as they exit the bar, but a Yakuza assassin waiting outside cuts Ralfi to pieces with a monomolecular wire hidden in a prosthetic thumb. Johnny fires his shotgun at the assassin but misses due to the man's enhanced reflexes. Molly is delighted to be facing another professional. Johnny decides that the only way to save himself from the same fate as Ralfi is to get the data out of his head, which can be done only by using a SQUID to retrieve the password. Molly takes him to an amusement park to meet Jones, a cybernetically enhanced dolphin retired from Navy service. Jones' previous assignment was to locate and hack into enemy mines using the SQUID and other sensors implanted in his skull. Since he is now addicted to heroin, the result of the Navy's efforts to keep its dolphins loyal, Molly trades him a batch in exchange for finding the password. Johnny then has Molly read it out so he can enter his retrieval trance, with recorders capturing all the data. They upload a snippet to a Yakuza communications satellite and threaten to release the rest unless Johnny is left alone. To deal with the Yakuza assassin, who is still following them, Molly leads Johnny to the Lo Teks, a group of anti-technology outcasts who live in a suspended hideout near the top of the geodesic domes covering the Sprawl. At Molly's request, the Lo Teks allow the assassin to climb up so she can face him on the \\"Killing Floor,\\" a sprung-floor arena wired to synthesizers and amplifiers. Molly dances around the assassin, causing discordant noise to blare from the sound system. She eventually tricks him into slicing off his own hand with his thumb wire. Overwhelmed by the noise and the strange environment, he jumps through a hole in the floor and falls to his death. The story closes nearly a year later, with Johnny now living among the Lo Teks. He and Molly have gone into business for themselves, using Jones' SQUID to retrieve traces of all the data he has ever carried and blackmailing former clients with it. Development In Gibson's 1984 novel Neuromancer, the first of the Sprawl trilogy, Molly relates the rest of Johnny's story to the protagonist, Case. Molly claims that after achieving success, Johnny was murdered by a vat-grown Yakuza ninja.

The name is derived from a mistake made by the compositors: in the Ten Commandments (), the word \\"not\\" in the sentence \\"Thou shalt not commit adultery\\" was omitted, thus changing the sentence into \\"Thou shalt commit adultery\\". This blunder was spread in a number of copies. About a year later, the publishers of the Wicked Bible were called to the Star Chamber and fined and deprived of their printing license. The fact that this edition of the Bible contained such a flagrant mistake outraged Charles I and George Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury.Ingelbart, Louis Edward (1987). Press Freedoms. A Descriptive Calendar of Concepts, Interpretations, Events, and Courts Actions, from 4000 B.C. to the Present, p. 40, Greenwood Publishing. The majority of the Wicked Bible's copies were immediately cancelled and destroyed, and the number of extant copies remaining today, which are considered highly valuable by collectors, is thought to be relatively low. One copy is in the collection of rare books in the New York Public Library and is very rarely made accessible; another can be seen in the Dunham Bible Museum in Houston, Texas, US. The British Library in London had a copy on display, opened to the misprinted commandment, in a free exhibition until September 2009.Wicked Bible on free public display in British Library, London The Wicked Bible also appeared on display for a limited time at the Ink and Blood Exhibit in Gadsden, Alabama, from 15 August to 2 September 2009. A copy was also displayed until 18 June 2011 at the Cambridge University Library exhibition in England, for the 400-year anniversary of the King James Version. Background Wicked Bible (1631 KJV) Exodus 20, with the typographical error highlighted Historically, the omission of \\"not\\" was considered quite a common mistake. Until 2004, for example, the style guide of the Associated Press advised using \\"innocent\\" instead of \\"not guilty\\" to describe acquittals, so as to prevent this eventuality. The Wicked Bible is the most prominent example of the bible errata which often have absent negatives that completely reverse the scriptural meaning. On the other hand, some have suggested that someone (possibly a rival printer) purposefully sabotaged the printing of the Wicked Bible so that Robert Barker and Martin Lucas would lose their exclusive license to print the Bible. This theory is based on the fact that there are two significant errors in the Wicked Bible, and both errors are located in the chapters where the Ten Commandments appear. The first appears in Exodus 20 where the word \\"not\\" was omitted. The second appears in Deuteronomy 5, where the word 'greatness' has been misprinted as 'great-asse', leading to a sentence reading 'Behold, the Lord our God hath shewed us his glory and his great-asse...', giving the sense of God showing his great rear, rather than his greatness.  Public reaction  = 1631 = The title page of the Wicked Bible Apart from the contempt within the church, the case of the Wicked Bible was commented on by historians soon after the printing: = Modern times = The nickname Wicked Bible seems to have first been applied in 1855 by rare book dealer Henry Stevens. As he relates in his memoir of James Lenox, after buying what was then the only known copy of the 1631 octavo Bible for fifty guineas, \\"on June 21, I exhibited the volume at a full meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of London, at the same time nicknaming it 'The Wicked Bible,' a name that has stuck to it ever since.\\"Stevens, Henry.

Regiments were the highest organized organic units in the Swedish Army from the time of Gustavus Adolphus on to the Second World War. In 1949, the Swedish Army was reorganised, with the regiments being used as training units for conscripts during peacetime. The new main fighting unit was the brigade, only organised in wartime (with a few exceptions). The division (f√∂rdelning) is not a static organization, but can have brigades assigned and removed when needed, similar to other countries' corps formations. For a short background of the Swedish conscription system historically used, see the article on the Swedish allotment system.  Grand regiments  Storregementen or landsregementen (regiments of the land), these regiments were organized by Gustavus Adolphus in the end of the 1610s from the smaller units f√§nika and fana raised in the various parts of Sweden during the time of Gustav Vasa: * Norrlands storregemente (Norrland Grand Regiment) * Upplands storregemente (Uppland Grand Regiment) * S√∂dermanlands storregemente (S√∂dermanland Grand Regiment) * √ñsterg√∂tlands storregemente (√ñsterg√∂tland Grand Regiment) * V√§sterg√∂tlands storregemente (V√§sterg√∂tland Grand Regiment) * Sm√•lands storregemente (Sm√•land Grand Regiment) * Finlands storregemente (√ñsterbotten Grand Regiment) * Karelska storregementet (Karelian Grand Regiment) * V√§stra Finlands storregemente (Western Finland Grand Regiment) * Mellersta Finlands storregemente (Middle Finland Grand Regiment) * √ñstra Finlands storregementet (Eastern Finland Grand Regiment)  Infantry and cavalry regiments  The original provincial regiments (landskapsregementen) were raised by splitting the old grand regiments, forming 20 infantry (actually 21 as Sm√•lands regemente was split into Kronobergs and J√∂nk√∂pings regemente) and eight cavalry regiments as written in the Swedish constitution of 1634. As time went on, new regiments were raised by conscription, created by splitting old regiments or enlisting soldiers from various dominions of Sweden. There were also times when temporary regiments were raised; these regiments were called m√§nningsregementen. = Infantry = = Cavalry =  Artillery and other regiments  = Artillery = = Armour = = Anti-aircraft = = Coastal artillery = = Engineer = = Signal = = Logistic =  See also  *Swedish Armed Forces *Military district *List of Swedish defence districts *List of Swedish wars  References  Print * Braunstein, Christian (2003).

Fury and his Howling Commandos was a comic book series created by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee and published by Marvel Comics from 1963 to 1981. The main character, Sgt. Nick Fury, later became the leader of Marvel's super-spy agency, S.H.I.E.L.D. The title also featured the Howling Commandos, a fictional World War II unit that first appeared in Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #1 (cover dated May 1963). Publication history Stan Lee has described the series Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos as having come about due to a bet with his publisher, Martin Goodman that the Lee-Kirby style could make a book sell even with the worst title Lee could devise.Ro, Ronin. Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and the American Comic Book Revolution (Bloomsbury USA, 2005 reissue ), p. 78: Lee elaborated on that claim in a 2007 interview, responding to the suggestion that the series title did not necessarily seem bad: Comics-artist contemporary John Severin recalled in an interview conducted in the early 2000s that in the late 1950s, Kirby had approached him to be partners on a syndicated, newspaper comic strip \\"set in Europe during World War Two; the hero would be a tough, cigar-chomping sergeant with a squad of oddball GIs -- sort of an adult Boy Commandos\\",Ro, pp. 78-79 referring to a 1940s wartime \\"kid gang\\" comics series Kirby had co- created for DC Comics. Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos followed an elite special unit, the First Attack Squad, nicknamed the \\"Howling Commandos\\", which was stationed in a military base in England to fight missions primarily, but not exclusively, in the European theatre of World War II. Under Captain \\"Happy Sam\\" Sawyer, Fury was the cigar-chomping noncom who led the racially and ethnically integrated unit (racial integration was unusual for the then- segregated U.S. military, though possible in elite special forces units).Lovece, Nimbus #3, p. 4: \\"[T]he book was unlike most group comics in that the cast were not all WASP, but instead, a superb melting pot of various religions, races, colors, and creeds, an incredible challenge to do naturalistically yet inoffensively.\\" Lee was obliged to send a memo to the color separator at the printing plant to confirm that the character Gabe Jones was African American, after the character had appeared with Caucasian coloring in the first issue. The series ran 167 issues (May 1963 - Dec. 1981), though with reprints alternating with new stories from issue #80 (Sept. 1970), and only in reprints after issue #120 (July 1974); at this point the formal copyrighted title in the indicia, which had been simply Sgt. Fury, was changed to match the trademarked cover logo, Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.Sgt. Fury (issues #1-120) at the Grand Comics DatabaseSgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos (issues #121-167) at the Grand Comics Database Following seven issues by creators Lee and Kirby (who returned to collaborate on #13 and on the opening and closing pages of #18), penciller Dick Ayers began his long stint on what would be his signature series, penciling 95 issues, including two extra-length annuals.Lovece, Nimbus #3, p. 6 John Severin later joined as inker, forming a long-running, award-winning team; he would, additionally, both pencil and ink issues #44-46. The series' only other pencilers came on one issue each by Tom Sutton (which Ayers said was \\"done that time I asked for a furlough and reassignment\\")Ayers in Lovece, Nimbus #3, p. 9 and Herb Trimpe (\\"They shuffled Trimpe and me around, [him] to Fury and [me] and Severin to [The Incredible] Hulk\\" Ayers recalled.) Roy Thomas followed Lee as writer, himself followed by Gary Friedrich, for whom this also became a signature series.Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos at the Grand Comics Database Ayers said in 1977, \\"Stan Lee left Fury first to Roy Thomas because the superheroes were gaining in popularity at that time it was best he concentrate on them\\", referring to the young Marvel's then growing line of superhero comics, such as Fantastic Four and The Amazing Spider-Man. \\"I must admit I resented somewhat those superheroes taking Stan away from Fury!Ayers in Lovece, Nimbus #3, p. 7 Friedrich began as a co-scripter of issues #42-44 (May‚ÄìJuly 1967). The Friedrich-Ayers-Severin team began in earnest, however, with #45 (Aug. 1967), the first of what would be several of the series' \\"The\\" stories: \\"The War Lover\\", a shaded exploration of a trigger-happy soldier and the line drawn, even in war, between killing and murder. Daring for the time, when majority public sentiment still supported the undeclared Vietnam War, the story balanced present-day issues while demonstrating that even in what is referred to as \\"a just war\\", a larger morality prevails. As one writer in the 1970s observed, Sgt. Fury #57 (Aug. 1968), featuring a Friedrich \\"The\\" story. Cover art by Dick Ayers & John Severin. At his best, Ayers' art in Sgt. Fury showed \\"a clear, forthright storyteller, excellent in medium close shots with a subtly out-of-focus background. He blended large panels with thin or small ones for movement, and often provided vast, cinemascopic panoramas for his writers to work with.... [E]ven in a scene that would ordinarily be static you could feel his characters breathing.\\"Lovece, Nimbus #3, p. 7 Inker Severin \\"took the art even further, laying dark, scratchy inks\\" that gave grit to Ayers' pencils. Ayers himself \\"liked the results of John Severin's work on Sgt. Fury immensely\\", he said in 1977. \\"He added details beyond what I'd put in. He always seemed to go one step beyond.\\" Friedrich continued through #83 (Jan. 1971), with the late part of this run having reprint issues alternating with new stories. He returned for the even-numbered issues from #94-114 (Jan. 1972 - Nov. 1973). Sgt. Fury ran concurrently with two other, short-lived Marvel World War II series, Capt. Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders (later titled Captain Savage and his Battlefield Raiders), which lasted 19 issues from 1968‚Äì1970; and Combat Kelly and the Deadly Dozen, which lasted nine issues from 1972-1973. The Howlers guest starred in #6 and #11 of the former series, and #4 of the latter. Lee explained the series's transition to reprints: \\"... so much fan mail came in from readers who wanted more of Sgt. Fury, but we didn't have time, I didn't have the men to draw it, I didn't have the time to write it, and we were busy with other things, so we just started re-printing the books, and strangely enough, the reprint versions of Sgt. Fury sold as well as the original ones had!\\" The final issue, #167 (Dec. 1981) reprinted the first issue. Seven annual publications appeared, the first titled Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos Special King Size Annual #1 (1965), and the remainder titled Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos King-Size Special #2-7 (1966 - Nov. 1971), with hyphen and sans \\"Annual\\". The final three contain reprints only, save for a 10-page framing sequence in #6. In annuals #1 and #3, the Howlers reunited for a special mission each in the Korean War and the Vietnam War, respectively; annual #2 found them storming the beaches at Normandy on D-Day in 1944, and annual #4 was a flashback to the Battle of the Bulge.Sgt. Fury Annual at the Grand Comics Database One latter-day story was published in Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #1 (July 2009), as the cover logo read; its copyright indicia read Sgt. Fury & His Howling Commandos One-Shot #1. The 32-page story, \\"Shotgun Opera\\", was by writer Jesse Alexander and artist John Paul Leon.Sgt. Fury & His Howling Commandos One-Shot #1 at the Grand Comics Database. Characters In addition to Fury, the elite special unit of US Army Rangers nicknamed the Howling Commandos consisted of * Corporal Timothy Aloysius Cadwallader \\"Dum Dum\\" Dugan - A former circus strongman, Dum Dum is Fury's good right hand. He occasionally refers to his wife (\\"ugh!\\") in Boston and his mother-in-law (\\"double ugh!\\") as reasons that he enlisted, preferring fighting Nazis to dealing with them. * Private Isadore \\"Izzy\\" Cohen - The first demonstrably Jewish American comic book hero. Izzy is a master mechanic.Alexander, Mark. \\"Wah-Hoo!! Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos\\", Jack Kirby Collector #24 (April 1999) * Private Gabriel Jones - An African American serving in an integrated unit. (The regular U.S. armed forces were not in real-life integrated until after the war, in 1948. However, certain elite units were in other comic books.)In comic books, the DC Comics feature \\"Sgt.

He is fluent in both Italian and German. * Private Robert \\"Rebel\\" Ralston - an ex-jockey from Kentucky Bluegrass country. * Private Percival \\"Pinky\\" Pinkerton - Loosely modeled after real life Commando and movie actor David Niven, this British soldier replaced Juniper in issue #8 (July 1964). * Private Jonathan \\"Junior\\" Juniper ‚Äî In an unusual and daring move for comics at the time, Junior was killed in action after a few issues (#4, Nov. 1963). As one comics historian wrote in 1999, \\"Today that's no big deal but in 1963, comics heroes simply didn't die; not permanently, anyway. Suddenly, with the death of 'Junior' Juniper, the series acquired some real cachet. It now played like a true-life war drama where people got killed and never came back. You wondered who would be next.\\" * Private Eric Koenig - A defector from Nazi Germany who joined the squad in issue #27 (Feb. 1966). =Izzy Cohen= Isadore \\"Izzy\\" Cohen is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. His first appearance was in Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos vol. 1 #1 (May 1963). Fictional character biography Cohen is one of the many allies of Nick Fury who work together in battling the Nazi menace throughout World War 2. Cohen has had dozens of adventures with the team, such as in Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos #32, where he comes under the influence of Nazi brainwashing. He manages to resist the commands to kill his friends and is able to help turn the tables on his brainwasher and complete the interrupted mission to destroy a weapons plant. During his adventures, his sister, unnamed, is briefly seen. After the war, Cohen goes back to Brooklyn, settles down with his wife and runs his father's mechanic shop. He has two sons and one daughter. He turns the family business into a string of car dealerships, which he eventually passes down to his sons. Cohen signs up for a tour of duty in the Korean War, where he makes the rank of sergeant. Cohen's military career continues to the Vietnam war, where he reunites with the Commandos for a special mission. Outside of the war, Cohen still ends up in trouble. In a 1972 reunion he ends up shot and a decade later, he confronts a Life Model Decoy of the Nazi war criminal Baron von Strucker. When Nick Fury's espionage organization S.H.I.E.L.D. is corrupted by a sentient Life Model Decoy and nearly destroyed from within, Cohen serves with the group until it can get back on its feet. Over the years Cohen and his friends have dealt with Nick Fury's deaths, mostly correctly guessing it was some sort of ruse or LMD. They were fooled in one instance where the vigilante Punisher, not in his right mind, had slain a Fury LMD. Powers and abilities Cohen is considered a mechanical genius. Though he specializes in automobiles, he has a talent for rigging and fixing all sorts of mechanical devices. As a ranger, he is also trained in explosives. His weaponry tends to consist of grenades and machine guns. In other media * Izzy appears briefly in the X-Men animated series from the 1990s, in the episode \\"Old Soldiers\\", along with two of his comrades of the Howling Commandos, Nick Fury and Dum Dum Dugan, rescuing Captain America and Wolverine. * Cohen appears in The Super Hero Squad Show episode \\"Wrath of the Red Skull\\". He alongside Dum Dum Dugan and Gabe Jones were featured in a flashback when Nick Fury recounts how he and Captain America fought the Red Skull. * Izzy Cohen appears in the 1998 live-action TV movie Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. where he is agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.. * Izzy Cohen appears in the 1996 animated series The Incredible Hulk voiced by Thom Barry. He is portrayed as a ruthless S.H.I.E.L.D. agent working with General Thunderbolt Ross' \\"Hulkbusters\\" team. * Izzy Cohen appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes episode \\"Meet Captain America\\", as a member of the Howling Commandos. Fictional team history In issue #34 (Sept. 1966) it is shown that a young Nick Fury with his friend Red Hargrove, left their childhood neighborhood to pursue their dreams of adventure, eventually settling on a daring wing-walking aviation act. Their death-defying stunts caught the attention of Lieutenant Samuel \\"Happy Sam\\" Sawyer when Fury and Hargrove were training British Commandos in low-level parachuting. Sawyer was serving with the British Commandos in 1940 and underwent training by Fury. Sawyer enlisted them for a special mission in the Netherlands. Nick and Red later joined the U.S. Army, with Fury undergoing basic training under a Sergeant Bass at Fort Dix in New Jersey. Both Fury and Red were stationed at Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked the base on December 7, 1941, and Red was among the many killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor.This paragraph per Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #62 (Jan. 1969) Sawyer recruited select U.S. Army Rangers to his \\"Able\\" Company. Sawyer assigned Fury the command of the First Attack Squad, nicknamed the \\"Howling Commandos\\". They and the Second Attack Squad (the \\"Maulers\\", led by Sgt. \\"Bull\\" McGiveney, with Cpl. \\"Ricketts\\" Johnson),The Maulers and McGiveney introduced in issues #7 (May 1964); Johnson introduced #33 (Aug. 1966) and, later, Jim Morita's Nisei squadThe unnamed squadron was newly created in its first appearance, Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #38 (Jan. 1967). Per The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Jim Morita, \\"Able Company was shown to have four attack squads in Sgt. Fury #11. Perhaps Morita's squad was the Fifth Attack Squad?\\" were stationed in a military base in England to fight specialized missions, primarily, but not exclusively, in the European theatre of World War II, eventually going as far afield as the Pacific theatre, Africa, and, once each, in the Middle East and on the Russian front. Fury fell in love with an English nurse, Pamela Hawley, who died in a bombing raid of London before he could propose to her.Introduced in #4 (Nov. 1963), died in #18 (May 1965) The Howling Commandos' earliest (but not first-published) assignment occurred in the autumn of 1942. They were to recover British rocket scientist Dr. MacMillan from a German military base in occupied Norway. Their success brought the attention of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who incorporated the unit into the British Army, and given the title of \\"Commandos\\". The Howlers fought against the likes of German General Erwin Rommel and inter-squad bigotry, often in the same story. Antagonists included Baron Strucker, Captain America's nemeses Baron Zemo and the Red Skull (Adolf Hitler's prot√©g√©), and other Axis villains. The Howlers encountered Office of Strategic Services agent Reed Richards (later Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four) in issue #3 (Sept. 1963), and fought alongside Captain America and Bucky in #13 (Dec. 1964). They reunited for missions in the Korean War, where Fury received a field promotion to lieutenant, and the Vietnam War, each in a summer-annual special, as well as at a present-day, fictional reunion gala in issue #100 (July 1972). In other media =Television= Animation * The Howling Commandos appear in a cameo of X-Men animated series from the 1990s. In the episode \\"Old Soldiers\\", they appear in the episode's final moments of to rescue Captain America and Wolverine from Red Skull's fortress. * Dum Dum Dugan, Gabe Jones and Izzy Cohen appear on The Super Hero Squad Show. They appear in the episode \\"Wrath of the Red Skull\\". While Nick Fury is shown in a flashback, the other three are partially shadowed. * Dugan, Jones, Rebel Ralston, Izzy Cohen, Dino Manelli, Pinky Pinkerton, James Howlett (a.k.a. Logan) and Jack Fury (the father of Nick Fury) appear in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. They first appear in the episode \\"Meet Captain America\\" and later reappear in the episode \\"The Fall of Asgard\\" as illusions. Live action * The Howling Commandos are seen in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. In the episode \\"The Only Light in the Darkness\\", S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Antoine Triplett identifies himself as the grandson of a Howling Commando. In the episode \\"Ragtag\\", Triplett gets some of his grandfather's old equipment from his grandmother for the team. Both Dum Dum Dugan and Jim Morita appear in a flashback in the episode \\"Shadows\\", led by Peggy Carter, with Neal McDonough and Kenneth Choi reprising their roles from the film Captain America: The First Avenger. * In Agent Carter, the team reappears led by Dugan, with Neal McDonough reprising his role. Their number includes Happy Sam Sawyer (Leonard Roberts), Junior Juniper (James Austin Kerr) and Pinky Pinkerton (Richard Short). In the episode \\"The Iron Ceiling\\", Juniper reveals he was the one who came up with the \\"Howling Commandos\\" name, much to Sawyer's dismay. =Film= As depicted in Captain America: The First Avenger. * Though unnamed as a group, the Howling Commandos appear in the 2011 film Captain America: The First Avenger. Screenwriter Christopher Markus explained, \\"They are commandos and at one point they do howl. They're called the Howling Commandos in the script, but no one says that out loud.\\" Their number includes Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Dum Dum Dugan (Neal McDonough), Gabe Jones (Derek Luke), Montgomery Falsworth (J. J. Feild), Jim Morita (Kenneth Choi), and Jacques Dernier (Bruno Ricci). In February 2010, director Johnston stated that the World War II-era super team the Invaders would appear in \\"the entire second half\\" of the film, though he later explained that \\"the Invaders\\" had been discussed simply as a possible name for the squad of commandos Captain America leads in the film. In the 2014 sequel Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the team is specifically identified as the Howling Commandos, in narration for an exhibit in the Smithsonian. =Video Game= *In the Captain America: Super Soldier video game, Howling Commando members Bucky, Falsworth, Dugan and Falsworth are NPCs.

He has published ten books, most recently History and the Testimony of Language (2011) and A Dictionary of Sandawe (2012), the latter co-edited with his wife, Patricia Ehret. He has written around seventy scholarly articles on a wide range of historical, linguistic, and anthropological subjects. These works include monographic articles on Bantu subclassification; on internal reconstruction in Semitic; on the reconstruction of proto-Cushitic and proto- Eastern Cushitic; and, with Mohamed Nuuh Ali, on the classification of the Soomaali languages. He has also contributed to a number of encyclopedias on African topics and on world history. Career Ehret's historical books emphasize early African history. In An African Classical Age (1998) he argues for a conception of the period from 1000 BC to 400 AD in East Africa as a \\"classical age\\" during which a variety of major technologies and social structures first took shape. His Civilizations of Africa: A History to 1800 (2002), brings together the whole of African history from the close of the last ice age down to the end of the eighteenth century. With the archaeologist Merrick Posnansky, he also edited The Archaeological and Linguistic Reconstruction of African History (1982), at that time a state-of-the-field survey of the correlation of linguistic and archaeological findings in the different major regions of the continent. In reviewing An African Classical Age for the Annuals of the American Academy, Ronald Atkinson calls it \\"not easy or light reading\\", but concludes that \\"the result is a remarkably rich, evocative social and cultural history‚Ä¶‚Äù and that it \\"will itself become a classic and shape future scholarship in early African history for many years to come\\". The late Kennell Jackson of Stanford, writing in The Historian, says that \\"by the book‚Äôs midpoint, the immensity of his synthesis becomes apparent, as well as Ehret‚Äôs achievement as a historical conceptualizer. He repeatedly challenges formulaic ideas about causality, linearity as a model of change, and the cultural factors affecting innovation‚Ä¶. Ehret has written a fabulous African history book, furthering a genre far from the seemingly ubiquitous slavery studies and trendy colonial social history\\". Peter Robertshaw in the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, offers a more measured conclusion: \\"Ehret has produced a remarkably coherent and detailed history which should spur further research\\". The historian Esperanza Brizuela-Garcia, in her review of The Civilizations of Africa for the African Studies Review, calls this book \\"challenging and innovative\\" for presenting \\"the early history of Africa within the context of wide historical processes such as the development of agriculture, the emergence of metalwork, and the evolution of trade‚Ä¶. It gives these themes a thorough and masterful treatment‚Ä¶. By looking at broad themes of the history of human experience, Ehret is able to explain what makes Africa unique and what makes it comparable to other continents\\". She concludes: \\"The most important achievement of Ehret‚Äôs book is that finally the early history of the continent is taken seriously and is presented in detail and form that do justice to its complexity and depth. One hopes that Christopher Ehret has initiated a new trend in the writing of African history textbooks, one that challenges previously accepted chronologies and ideas and presents us with an interpretation that connects social, economic, political, and cultural history\\". Scott MacEachern's review of the same book for the Journal of Africa History adds an archaeologist's perspective: \\"The book is well written and comprehensive and abundantly illustrates the richness and complexity of African societies over many thousands of years. More discussion of methodologies and data compatibility, and a more complete reference list, would have been useful. It will make a fine introductory text for courses in African history, especially if supplemented by books and papers that reflect other research methods and their results\\". Ehret's linguistic tome, Reconstructing Proto-Afroasiatic (Proto-Afrasian): Vowels, Tone, Consonants, and Vocabulary (1995), is the subject of a detailed review article in Afrika und √úbersee by the distinguished scholar of Afroasiatic languages, Ekkehard Wolff. Wolff writes: \\"Ehrets opus magnum ist ein Parforce-Ritt durch schwierigstes Terrain, bei dem sich der Reiter auch an die steilsten Hindernissen √ºberraschend gut in Sattel h√§lt und an nur einer einzigen H√ºrde nach Meinung des Rez. scheitert (‚Ä¶Tonalit√§t). Es ist ein nahezu unm√∂glisches, ein sehr mutiges und ein m√∂glicherweise epochales Buch\\". (\\"Ehret‚Äôs opus magnum is a steeplechase ride through the most difficult terrain, in which the rider stays in the saddle astonishingly well even at the steepest obstacles and, in the opinion of the reviewer, crashes at only a single hurdle (‚Ä¶tone). It is a nearly impossible, a very courageous, and a possibly epochal book\\".) After an extensive and thorough critical commentary on the contents of the book, Wolff concludes: \\"Ehret hat nichts weniger versucht als einen zuk√ºnftigen \\"Klassiker\\" zu schreiben....‚Äù (\\"Ehret has sought to write nothing less than a future \\"Classic\\"....) This particular book appeared in the same year as another comparative work on the same language family, Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova's Hamito-Semitic Etymological Dictionary: Materials for a Reconstruction. Two reviewers have given comparative assessments of the two books, John Greppin in the Times Literary Supplement, 1 November 1996, and Robert Ratcliffe in a paper, \\"Afroasiatic Comparative Lexica: Implications for Long (and Medium) Range Language Comparison\\". Greppin writes a strongly positive review; Ratcliffe takes a more negative stance toward both books. Ehret's 2001 book, A Historical-Comparative Reconstruction of Nilo-Saharan, has had a mixed reception. V√°clav Bla≈æek, in a review article originally prepared for Afrikanische Arbeitspapiere, presents additional data, most of which, in his words, \\"confirm Ehret‚Äôs cognate sets\\". He continues, \\"The weakest point in the‚Ä¶monograph consists in semantics. Ehret‚Äôs approach is rather benevolent ‚Ä¶. But in any case, in the present time Ehret‚Äôs work signifies big progress\\". The sociologist and linguist Gerard Philippson in his review in the Journal of African Languages and Linguistics, also raises questions on some of the semantic connections, and he has doubts about the environments of certain sound changes proposed in the book. He has issues as well with Ehret's use of evidence from the Central Sudanic branch of the Nilo- Saharan family, but he finds his arguments relating to the Eastern Sahelian (Eastern Sudanic) branch convincing and \\"solid\\". He avers in conclusion: \\"M√™me les chercheurs s'opposant √† cette reconstruction disposeront, en tous cas, d'une somme de mat√©riaux, clairement pr√©sent√©s dans l'ensemble, sur lesquels ils pourront s'appuyer pour mettre en cause ou reb√¢tir l'ensemble propos√©. Il s'agit de toutes fa√ßons d'un travail qui ne saurait √™tre ignor√©.\\" (\\"Even the researchers who are opposed to this reconstruction will have, in any case, an amount of material, clearly presented throughout, which they can rely on to either challenge or rebuild what is proposed. As a whole, it constitutes a work which cannot be ignored\\".) Roger Blench, a development anthropologist, published a critical comparison of Ehret's and M. L. Bender's comparative work on the Nilo-Saharan family in Africa und √úbersee in 2000‚Äîfrom its date, seemingly written before the book came out. It may be based, in part, on a preliminary manuscript by Ehret from the early 1990s. Recent years In recent years Ehret has carried his work in several new directions. One of these has been the history and evolution of early human kinship systems. A second interest has been to apply the methods of historical reconstruction from linguistic evidence to issues in anthropological theory and in world history. He has also collaborated with geneticists in seeking to correlate linguistic with genetic findings (e.g., Sarah A. Tishkoff, Floyd A. Reed, F. R. Friedlaender, Christopher Ehret, Alessia Ranciaro, et al., \\"The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans\\", Science 324, 22 May 2009) and in developing mathematical tools for dating linguistic history (e.g., Andrew Kitchen, Christopher Ehret, Shiferew Assefa, and Connie Mulligan, \\"Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of Semitic languages identifies an Early Bronze Age origin of Semitic in the Near East,\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, July 2009).

Molly Millions (also known as Sally Shears, Rose Kolodny, and others) is a recurring character in stories and novels written by William Gibson, particularly his Sprawl trilogy. She first appeared in \\"Johnny Mnemonic\\", to which she makes an oblique reference in Neuromancer (where she is mostly referred to as \\"Molly\\" with no last name given). Her most recent literary appearance was under the name \\"Sally Shears\\" in the book Mona Lisa Overdrive. Character history In all three stories, Molly is a physically tough (but not instantly imposing) bodyguard/mercenary cyborg. She is referred to as a \\"razorgirl\\" or \\"street samurai\\" throughout his stories and also as \\"Steppin' Razor\\" by the residents of Zion, a Rastafarian enclave aboard a space station. A useful contact for dealing with gangs and black market elements, she tends to show little remorse for the opponents she ruthlessly dispatches in the course of her objectives. In fact she shows few deep emotions towards anyone outside of hatred, suspicion or amused contempt. Nevertheless, Molly is always regarded throughout the book as a loyal, morally strong character, opposed to the progressing decay of human relations in the world Gibson depicts. An exception to her cold, somewhat cynical approach to life was her relationship with Johnny (of Johnny Mnemonic), for whom she still mourned at the time of Neuromancer. This is part of the personal history she relates to its protagonist, Case, in addition to the revelation that she worked as a \\"meat puppet\\" (a prostitute) in a \\"puppet parlor\\" (a brothel where people loan out their bodies while maintained in a blanked-out state) to pay for her considerable cybernetic enhancements. Another pseudonym, used when she rents a hotel room in Neuromancer, is \\"Rose Kolodny\\", the name by which the Turing Police refer to her. The Turing Police may have simply gotten the name from the hotel's registry, but it is sometimes speculated to be her original name. The later trilogy books speculate that she is \\"SINless\\", having been an unrecorded birth and never having been issued a \\"Single Identity Number\\". This would give her the advantage of being more difficult to track in the cyberspace environment. Critic Larry McCaffery asserts that the name \\"Molly\\" is a reference to her status as a gun moll. William Gibson has stated that he derived inspiration for the character from the image of Chrissie Hynde on the cover of the first Pretenders album.Twitter comment: \\"Key iconic for Molly was C. Hynde on first Pretenders album cover (...)\\"Twitter comment: \\"(...) Not so much CH per se, but this particular image.\\"  Augmentations  Molly's metabolism, sensory input, and reflexes are artificially heightened by means of electronic implants and other advanced medical procedures. She has razor- sharp retractable blades underneath her fingernails, each double-edged and four centimeters in length. Appearing at first glance to be wearing mirrored sunglasses, Molly has in fact had her eye sockets sealed with vision-enhancing mirrored lenses, installed by the skilled black-market surgeons of Chiba City. To accommodate the inset lenses her tear ducts have been re-routed to her mouth; on the very rare occasions she cries, she either spits out or swallows the tears. She never lets others touch the lenses as it would leave messy fingerprints requiring extra cleaning.  Portrayal in other media  The 1995 film version of Johnny Mnemonic replaced Molly with a character named Jane who did not have modifications to her eyes or to her fingers. Jane did share the modified nervous system but used a single razor attached to the tip of flexible spring rod as a weapon. In the 2003 BBC Radio adaptation of Neuromancer, Molly was played by the English actress Nicola Walker. Sasha Grey took on the role in Case, a six-hour dramatic contemporary adaptation of the novel staged in New York City in November 2009.  Literary analysis  The character has been described as one of Gibson's most complex characters.

In one of the Inca foundation myths, Sinchi Roca led his family to the valley of Cuzco. He is said to have created a territorial division of his domains and is considered to be the initiator of the first census of the Inca population. He also ordered all members of his ethnic group (Inca) to pierce their ears as a sign of nobility. The 16th century Spanish writers, including Cabello de Balboa quoted by Mar√≠a Rostworowski, also affirm that Sinchi Roca would have been the first Inca to use Mascapaicha or Maskaypacha (Quechua: Mask'ay seek; Pacha land, world, or space-time), which would become the distinctive sign of Inca sovereignty. Among the Incas, the imperial crown was composed of several elementsÀê the mascapaicha, the most important, was a fringe of red wool,Carmen Bernand, Les Incas, peuple du soleil, Gallimard, coll. ¬´ D√©couvertes ¬ª, 24 novembre 1988 ( et 978-2070359813), p.25 ordered on the forehead because each of its strands \\"passed through a small tube of gold\\".Alfred M√©traux, Les Incas, √âditions du Seuil, coll. ¬´ Points Histoire n¬∞ H66 ¬ª, 1961 et 1983 ( et 978-2020064736), p. 71 Above this fringe were two or three black and white feathers of the sacred bird Korekenke (or Andean mountain caracara ). This fringe and feathers were secured on the forehead by a turban or headband known as the llautu or llauto consisting of a multicoloured braid \\"of extremely fine vicu√±a wool\\", wrapped several times around the head. The mascapaicha was the mark of absolute imperial power, to the point that \\"to take\\" or \\"to gird the mascapaicha\\" or \\"to claim the scarlet fringe\\" was the periphrase in use to signify the coming of the new emperor or Sapa Inca, during a ceremony where he received it from the hands of the Willaq Umu, the high priest or pontiff of the Inca religion. One of the stories told about Sinchi Roca was that during his reign a llama shepherd had entered his house and took a young woman whom he cherished very well. The Inca then had them captured and tortured him to tell why he had committed such a sin; the young woman, not wanting to see the villager tortured anymore, revealed that she had fallen in love with the llamamichi (shepherd of llamas) as soon as he saw him wearing a wacanqui (amulet of love), and the shepherd confessed, in turn, that he had received such an object from a demon in a cave. = Building program = The chronicler Pedro Cieza de Le√≥n states that Sinchi Roca built terraces and imported enormous quantities of soil in order to improve the fertility of the valley.The second part of the Chronicle of Peru by Pedro de Cieza de Le√≥n.

In the sport of cricket, different fielding restrictions are imposed depending on the type of match. They are used to discourage certain bowling tactics, or to encourage the batsmen to play big shots, enabling them to hit fours and sixes. Each team has nine fielders other than the wicket-keeper and bowler. The captain decides the fielding positions usually after consulting with the bowler. In Test cricket matches, the fielding restrictions are relaxed as compared to a One Day International. All forms In all forms of cricket, only two fielders are allowed in the quadrant between the fielding positions of square leg and long stop. This is to prevent the outlawed and controversial bodyline tactics from being used. No fielder is allowed on or over the pitch until the batsman has had a chance to play the ball. One day cricket Various rules concerning have applied during the history of one day cricket, with the dual aim of encouraging the batsman to play attacking shots and to prevent the fielding team from being too defensive by posting all their fielders on the boundary. The current rules applying to One Day Internationals were first introduced as trial rules in July 2001, and are also used for some other limited overs tournaments. =Men's Fielding Restriction Circles= An oval shall made by drawing two semi-circles on the field of play. The semi- circles shall have as their centre the middle stump at either end of the pitch. The radius of each of the semi-circles shall be . The semi-circles shall be linked by lines which are drawn parallel to the pitch. This line, is commonly known as the circle. Further, two circles centered on each wicket of radius are drawn and combined encompasses an area known as the close infield. During the first 10 overs of a 50-over innings a maximum of two fielders are allowed to be deployed in the outfield. Before July 2015, a minimum of two fielders (other than the bowler and wicket-keeper) had to be deployed in the close infield during Powerplay 1ICC changes rules again . If the number of overs in the innings is restricted to less than 24, the length of the fielding restrictions is reduced to eight or nine overs. At least 3 fielders must remain on either the Off or Leg Side. T10 cricket has the same restrictions as T20 but for half the time. Only two men outside the circle for the first six overs. =Women's Fielding Restriction Circles= In the Women's game the infield and close infield circles are smaller than in the Men's game. With the semicircles of the infield having a radius of and the close infield circles having a radius of The restriction of having a maximum of three fielders in the outfield is applied for a further two blocks of five overs, with the captains of the fielding and the batting sides deciding the timing of one block each. These five-over spells are called Powerplay 2 and Powerplay 3 and may be shortened if the length of the innings is restricted (Powerplay 1 is the first block of 10). Powerplays were first encountered in the One Day International between England and Australia on 7 July 2005. For the rest of the innings, a more generous maximum of five fielders in the outfield applies. =History= Fielding restrictions were first introduced in the Australian 1980-81 season. By 1992, only two fieldsmen were allowed outside the circle in the first fifteen overs, then five fieldsmen allowed outside the circle for the remaining overs. This was shortened to ten overs in 2005, and two five- over powerplays were introduced, with the bowling team having discretion over the timing for both. In 2008, the batting team was given discretion for the timing of one of the two powerplays. In 2011, the teams were restricted to completing the discretionary powerplays between the 16th and 40th overs; previously, the powerplays could take place at any time between the 11th and 50th overs. On October 30, 2012, changes to the rules for fielding restrictions in one-day matches were officially implemented by the ICC. The number of Powerplay blocks were reduced to two; the first occurs within the first 10 overs, restricting the team to two fielders outside the 30-yard circle. The second block, the Batting Powerplay with a restriction of three fielders outside the circle, must occur by the 40th over. The number of fielders outside the 30-yard circle in non-Powerplay overs has also been reduced to four (from five). In June 2015 rules changed to do away with batting powerplay, and allowed up to 5 fielders outside the circle in last 10 overs. The 2015 rule changes also included the removal of batting power play. http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/icc-changes-powerplay- fielding-free-hit-rules-in-odis/articleshow/47839734.cms Twenty20 The number of players in the outfield area is the same as for the One-day format, but the restriction lasts for the first six of the twenty overs, and there is no \\"Batting\\" or \\"Bowling\\" (Powerplays 2 and 3 in ODI's) Powerplay.

La Crosse encephalitis virus (LACV) is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. LAC encephalitis is rare; in the United States, about 80‚Äì100 LACV disease cases are reported each year, although it is believed to be under- reported due to minimal symptoms experienced by many of those affected.  Signs and symptoms  It takes 5 to 15 days after the bite of an infected mosquito to develop symptoms of LACV disease. Symptoms include nausea, headache, vomiting in milder cases and seizures, coma, paralysis and permanent brain damage in severe cases. LAC encephalitis initially presents as a nonspecific summertime illness with fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and lethargy. Severe disease occurs most commonly in children under the age of 16 and is characterized by seizures, coma, paralysis, and a variety of neurological sequelae after recovery. Death from LAC encephalitis occurs in less than 1% of clinical cases. In many clinical settings, pediatric cases presenting with CNS involvement are routinely screened for herpes or enteroviral causes. Since there is no specific treatment for LAC encephalitis, physicians often do not request the tests required to specifically identify LAC virus, and the cases are reported as aseptic meningitis or viral encephalitis of unknown cause. As with many infections, the very young, the very old and the immunocompromised are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms.  Cause  The La Crosse encephalitis virus is a type of arbovirus called a bunyavirus. The Bunyavirales are mainly arboviruses. Most cases of LAC encephalitis occur in children under 16 years of age. LAC virus is a zoonotic pathogen cycled between the daytime-biting treehole mosquito, Aedes triseriatus, and vertebrate amplifier hosts (chipmunks, tree squirrels) in deciduous forest habitats. The virus is maintained over the winter by transovarial transmission in mosquito eggs. If the female mosquito is infected, she may lay eggs that carry the virus, and the adults coming from those eggs may be able to transmit the virus to chipmunks and to humans. Anyone bitten by a mosquito in an area where the virus is circulating can get infected with LACV. The risk is highest for people who live, work or recreate in woodland habitats, because of greater exposure to potentially infected mosquitoes.  Prevention  People reduce the chance of getting infected with LACV by preventing mosquito bites. There is no vaccine or preventive drug. Prevention measures against LACV include reducing exposure to mosquito bites. Use repellent such as DEET and picaridin, while spending time outside, especially at during the daytime - from dawn until dusk. Aedes triseriatus mosquitoes that transmit (LACV) are most active during the day. Wear long sleeves, pants and socks while outdoors. Ensure all screens are in good condition to prevent mosquitoes from entering your home. Aedes triseriatus prefer treeholes to lay eggs in. Also, remove stagnant water such as old tires, birdbaths, flower pots, and barrels.  Treatment  No specific therapy is available at present for La Crosse encephalitis, and management is limited to alleviating the symptoms and balancing fluids and electrolyte levels. Intravenous ribavirin is effective against La Crosse encephalitis virus in the laboratory, and several studies in patients with severe, brain biopsy confirmed, La Crosse encephalitis are ongoing. In a trial with 15 children being infected with La Crosse viral encephalitis were treated at certain phases with ribavirin (RBV). RBV appeared to be safe at moderate doses. At escalated doses of RBV, adverse events occurred and then the trial was discontinued. Nonetheless, this was the largest study of antiviral treatment for La Crosse encephalitis.  Epidemiology  La Crosse encephalitis was discovered in 1965, after the virus was isolated from stored brain and spinal tissue of a child who died of an unknown infection in La Crosse, Wisconsin in 1960. It occurs in the Appalachian and Midwestern regions of the United States. Recently there has been an increase of cases in the South East of the United States. An explanation to this may be that the mosquito Aedes albopictus is also an efficient vector of La Crosse virus. Aedes albopictus is a species that has entered the US and spread across the SE of the US and replaced Aedes aegypti in most areas (which is not an efficient vector of LAC). Historically, most cases of LAC encephalitis occur in the upper Midwestern states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio). Recently, more cases are being reported from states in the mid-Atlantic (West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina) and southeastern (Alabama and Mississippi) regions of the country. It has long been suspected that LAC encephalitis has a broader distribution and a higher incidence in the eastern United States, but is under-reported because the causal agent is often not specifically identified. LAC encephalitis cases occur primarily from late spring through early fall, but in subtropical areas where the mosquito is found (e.g., the Gulf states), rare cases can occur in winter. According to the CDC, between 2004 and 2013 there were 787 total cases of La Crosse encephalitis and 11 deaths in the U.S. Looking at the distribution of cases across the United States by state, between 2004 and 2013 the most cases of La Crosse encephalitis was in North Carolina. North Carolina had 184 total cases, followed by Ohio with 178 total cases.  Related conditions  Similar diseases that are spread by mosquitoes include: Western and Eastern equine encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Saint Louis encephalitis and West Nile virus.

Chest radiographs may indicate pleural effusions and/or fibrosis, and neurological tests such as CT scans can show strokes and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure. A proportion of patients have a mutation involving the PDGFRA and FIP1L1 genes on the fourth chromosome, leading to a tyrosine kinase fusion protein. Testing for this mutation is now routine practice, as its presence indicates response to imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Treatment Treatment primarily consists of reducing eosinophil levels and preventing further damage to organs. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are good for reducing eosinophil levels and antineoplastics are useful for slowing eosinophil production. Surgical therapy is rarely utilised, however splenectomy can reduce the pain due to spleen enlargement. If damage to the heart (in particular the valves), then prosthetic valves can replace the current organic ones. Follow-up care is vital for the survival of the patient, as such the patient should be checked for any signs of deterioration regularly. After promising results in drug trials (95% efficiency in reducing blood eosinophil count to acceptable levels) it is hoped that in the future hypereosinophilic syndrome, and diseases related to eosinophils such as asthma and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, may be treated with the monoclonal antibody mepolizumab currently being developed to treat the disease. If this becomes successful, it may be possible for corticosteroids to be eradicated and thus reduce the amount of side effects encountered. Epidemiology The European Medicines Agency (EMA) estimated the prevalence of HES at the time of granting orphan drug designation for HES in 2004 at 1.5 in 100,000 people, corresponding to a current prevalence of about 8,000 in the EU, 5,000 in the U.S., and 2,000 in Japan.European Medicines Agency, Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products. Public summary of opinion on orphan designation: mepolizumab for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome. August 2010. Patients who lack chronic heart failure and those who respond well to prednisone or a similar drug have a good prognosis. However, the mortality rate rises in patients with anaemia, chromosomal abnormalities or a very high white blood cell count. History Hypereosinophilic syndrome was first described as a distinct entity by Hardy and Anderson in 1968.

It is most easily recognized by a large bony protuberance emanating from the anterior (front) of the skull.Osborn, H.F. 1929. Embolotherium, gen. nov., of the Ulan Gochu, Mongolia. American Museum Novitates ; no. 353 This resembles a battering ram, hence the name Embolotherium. The animal is known from about 12 skulls, several jaws, and a variety of other skeletal elements from the Ulan Gochu formation of Inner Mongolia and the Irgilin Dzo of Outer Mongolia. Taxonomy E. grangeri skull Several species of Embolotherium have been named, including Embolotherium andrewsi, Embolotherium grangeri, Embolotherium louksi, Embolotherium ultimum, Embolotherium ergilensi, and Embolotherium efremovi. However, only two species, Embolotherium andrewsi and Embolotherium grangeri, appear to be valid. Other supposed species of Embolotherium are probably synonymous with these two species and were originally based on juvenile skulls, poorly preserved fossil material, or specimens that are not significantly different from either E. andrewsi or E. grangeri. 207x207pxAnother genus of brontothere, Titanodectes, which was named for several lower jaws found in the same sedimentary deposits as Embolotherium, probably represents the same beast as Embolotherium grangeri. Protembolotherium is another closely related genus from the Middle Eocene, which is distinguished by a noticeably smaller ram. Description Skull, Tianjin Natural History Museum Complete skeletons of Embolotherium have not yet been recovered, but if one compares the skulls to other brontotheres, it was probably about tall at the shoulder and weighed around . Unlike many of the other Late Eocene brontotheres, there is no clear evidence that Embolotherium was sexually dimorphic. All known specimens have large rams. Therefore, coupled with the fact that the rams were hollow and fragile in comparison to the solid and sturdy horns of the North American brontotheres, such as Megacerops, it does not seem likely that the ram served as a weapon for contests between males. Rather, it might have had a non-sexual function, such as signaling to each other. The ram may have served as a specialized resonator for sound production. This hypothesis is suggested by the fact that the bony nasal cavity extends to the peak of the ram, thus implying that the nasal chamber was greatly elevated, possibly creating a resonating chamber.

The peninsula is extremely mountainous and each dialect's \\"territory\\" corresponds closely to the natural boundaries between different geographical regions of Korea. Most of the dialects are named for one of the traditional Eight Provinces of Korea. One is sufficiently distinct from the others to be considered a separate language, the Jeju language. Dialect areas Dialect zones identified by Shinpei Ogura (1944) Dialect zones in the National Atlas of Korea thumbuprightDistribution of tone and length in Korean dialects: Korea is a mountainous country, and Korean is consequently divided into numerous small local dialects. There are few clear demarcations, so dialect classification is necessarily to some extent arbitrary. A common classification, originally introduced by Shinpei Ogura in 1944 and adjusted by later authors, identifies six dialect areas: ;Hamgy≈èng (Northeastern) :Spoken in the Hamgyong Province (Kwanbuk and Kwannam) region, the northeast corner of Pyongan Province, and the Ryanggang Province of North Korea as well as the Jilin, Heilongjiang of Northeast China; Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan of former Soviet Union. Nine vowels: the eight of the standard language plus √∂. ;Pyongan (Northwestern) :Spoken in Pyongyang, Pyongan Province, Chagang Province, and neighboring Liaoning, of China. The basis of the standard language for North Korea. ;Central dialects :Commonly divided along provincial boundaries: :*Gyeonggi dialect, also called the \\"Seoul dialect\\": spoken in the Gyeonggi Province, Seoul and Incheon cities, as well as southeastern Kaesong (North Korea). The basis of the standard language for South Korea. :*Chungcheong dialects: spoken in the Chungcheong Province (Hoseo) region of South Korea, including the city of Daejeon. :*Yeongseo dialects: spoken in Yeongseo, Gangwon Province (South Korea) and neighbouring Kangwon Province (North Korea) to the west of the Taebaek Mountains. Yeongseo is quite distinct from the Yeongdong dialects to the east of the mountains. :*Yeongdong dialects: spoken in Yeongdong, Gangwon Province (South Korea) and neighbouring Kangwon Province (North Korea) to the east of the Taebaek Mountains. Yeongdong is quite distinct from the Central Korean dialects to the west of the mountains. :*Hwanghae dialect: spoken in Hwanghae Province of North Korea. Commonly included among the Central dialects, but some researchers argue that it does not fit there comfortably. ;Gyeongsang (Southeastern) :Spoken in Gyeongsang Province (Yeongnam) of South Korea, including the cities of Busan, Daegu and Ulsan. This dialect is easily distinguished from the Seoul dialect because its pitch is more varied. Six vowels, i, e, a, eo, o, u. ;Jeolla (Southwestern) :Spoken in the Jeolla Province (Honam) region of South Korea, including the city of Gwangju. Ten vowels: i, e, ae, a, √º, √∂, u, o, eu, eo. ;Jeju :Spoken on Jeju Island off the southwest coast of South Korea and is sometimes considered a separate Koreanic language. The nine vowels of Middle Korean, including arae-a (…î). May have additional consonants as well. Several linguists have suggested that a further dialect area should be split from the Northeastern dialects: ;Ryukchin (Yukchin) :Spoken in the historical Yukchin region which is located in the northern part of North Hamgyong Province, far removed from P'y≈èng'an, but has more in common with P'y≈èng'an dialects than with the surrounding Hamgy≈èng dialects. Since it has been isolated from the major changes of Korean language, it has preserved distinct features of Middle Korean. It is the only known tonal Korean language.ÊúùÈ≤úËØ≠ÂÖ≠ÈïáËØùÁöÑÊñπË®ÄÁâπÁÇπ A recent statistical analysis of these dialects suggests that the hierarchical structure within these dialects are highly uncertain, meaning that there is no quantitative evidence to support a family-tree-like relationship among them. Some researchers classify the Korean dialects in Western and Eastern dialects. Compared with Middle Korean, the Western dialects have preserved long vowels, while the Eastern dialects have preserved tones or pitch accent. The Jeju language and some dialects in North Korean make no distinction between vowel length or tone. But the Southeastern dialect and the Northeastern dialect may not be closely related to each other genealogically. The standard language * In South Korea, Standard Korean (ÌëúÏ§ÄÏñ¥/Ê®ôÊ∫ñË™û/pyojun-eo) is defined by the National Institute of the Korean Language as \\"the modern speech of Seoul widely used by the well-cultivated\\" (). In practice, it tends not to include features that are found exclusively in Seoul. * In North Korea, the adopting proclamation stated that the Pyongan dialect spoken in the capital of Pyongyang and its surroundings should be the basis for the North Korean standard language (Munhwa≈è); however, in practice, it remains \\"firmly rooted\\" in the Gyeonggi dialect, which had been the national standard for centuries. Despite North‚ÄìSouth differences in the Korean language, the two standards are still broadly intelligible. One notable feature within the divergence is the North's lack of anglicisms and other foreign borrowings due to isolationism and self-reliance‚Äîpure/invented Korean words are used in replacement.  Outside of the Korean peninsula  * Koryo-mar (Autonym: –ö–æ—Ä—ë –º–∞—Ä/Í≥†Î†§Îßê, Standard Korean: ), usually identified as a descendant of the Hamgy≈èng dialect, is spoken by the Koryo-saram, ethnic Koreans in the post-Soviet states of Russia and Central Asia. It consists of a Korean base vocabulary, but takes many loanwords and calques from Russian language. It is mostly based on Hamgyong and Ryukchin dialect, since Koryo-saram people are mainly from the northern part of Hamgyong region. * Zainichi Korean language (Ïû¨ÏùºÏñ¥; Ïû¨ÏùºÏ°∞ÏÑ†Ïñ¥) is a language or a dialect spoken among Koreans in Japan, strongly influenced by Japanese. * Korean language in China (Ï§ëÍµ≠Ï°∞ÏÑ†Ïñ¥) As discussed above, Koreans in China use a dialect nearly identical to Hamgy≈èng dialect in North Korea, but there are still some differences, as the former has relatively more loanwords from modern Chinese.

The institution was formerly known as Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts (ISOMATA). Idyllwild Arts is in the San Jacinto Mountains above Palm Springs, California in the San Bernardino National Forest, at an elevation of , 2 hours from Los Angeles, 2 hours from San Diego and 1 hour from Palm Springs. History Idyllwild Arts was founded by Dr. Max Krone and his wife, Beatrice. Envisioning a remote place where people of all backgrounds could come together to experience the arts, they established the Idyllwild Arts Foundation in 1946 and purchased acreage in the San Jacinto Mountains on which to build. In 1950, approximately one hundred adult students began attending summer classes in the arts. Over the years, summer activities have continued to grow, expanding to include programs for children of all ages, a Family Camp, Metals Week, Native American Arts Festival and the Chamber Music Festival. Classes in music, dance, theatre, visual arts, film, writing and Native American arts are offered to students from age 5 to adult. Each year over 1800 adults and children attend Idyllwild Arts Summer Program courses. Norman Corwin, Ansel Adams, Herbert Zipper, Marguerite N. Clapp, Mark Wilke, Bella Lewitzky, Fritz Scholder, Maria Martinez, Lucy Lewis, Meredith Willson and other luminaries taught courses there in the summer. In 1964, the school was given to the University of Southern California under the terms of an agreement with the Idyllwild Arts Foundation. In 1983, the Foundation exercised its option to resume independent management and resumed sole ownership of the school. In 1985, the first independent boarding high school for the arts in the western United States, the Idyllwild Arts Academy, was established. Idyllwild Arts Academy Idyllwild Arts Academy, the boarding school, offers a college preparatory program for grades 9‚Äì12 and post- graduates, with training in music, theater, dance, visual art, creative writing, film and interdisciplinary arts. An audition or portfolio is required for admission. Idyllwild Arts Summer Program The Idyllwild Arts Summer Program which began in the summer of 1950, includes more than 95 workshops. These are taught by professional artist-teachers, in dance, music, theatre, visual arts, creative writing, poetry, filmmaking, and Native Arts. The program for young people features a Children's Center whose participants range in age from 5 to 12 and who select classes and workshops in a variety of arts including multi-arts, dance, piano, theatre, visual arts, poetry and journal writing. Junior Artist's Center (ages 11‚Äì13) and Youth Arts Center (ages 13‚Äì18) offer courses to accommodate a broad range of skill levels and a wide variety of art experiences. Music opportunities include musical theatre, piano classes, jazz workshop, two bands, two orchestras and chamber music. Visual artists can select courses from introductory art exploration to ceramics, advanced painting and drawing, jewelry, photography, computer animation, mixed media, and video production. Writers can take poetry, fiction and playwriting workshops. Dancers participate in ballet, jazz and modern. Actors may take up to six weeks of Theatre Festival workshops, each of which includes a major performance. Each year, Idyllwild Arts provides financial aid for young people with limited financial resources: twenty-five percent of young people who participate in an arts workshop are awarded financial aid totaling approximately $500,000. Part of the program involves theme-related workshops, seminars and performances featuring artists, poets and musicians. Programs include: Native American Arts, Metals Week & the Chamber Music Festival. The culmination of the Summer Program is celebrated with a concert by the Festival Choir, Festival Wind Ensemble and the Festival Orchestra. In previous years this concert ended with a performance of Meredith Willson's \\"In Idyllwild\\" by the combined ensembles.

Plot Harry Folger is a snobby and arrogant food critic for a major newspaper. Restaurants live or die by his reviews which are often nasty. Folger's hobby is to collect matchbooks of restaurants he's destroyed and he displays them as tombstones in a graveyard scene at his office. One day, he hears about a mysterious new Chinese restaurant called \\"Mr. Lee's Chinese Cuisine\\" and immediately begins typing a review even though he had not visited the restaurant. \\"If you love your Pekingese don't ask for a doggie bag,\\" he writes. Harry grudgingly agrees to visit the establishment in person after being urged by his boss. When he enters, he orders a massive amount of food and then immediately asks for the check before trying any of his meal. Though disappointed, the owner Mr. Lee presents Harry with a fortune cookie. The fortune reads \\"A grand reward awaits you just around the corner.\\" As Harry is walking through the alley outside the restaurant, a bank robber knocks him down and drops $100,000 in diamonds before running away. The grateful jewelry store owner gives Harry $1,000 as a reward. Realizing the fortune cookies are indeed magical, Harry returns for more. He promises to change his review, but then receives a fortune that says \\"April arrives today bringing romance.\\" As it is September, an angry Harry storms out, intending to go back on his promise. Before he can get to his office, he meets a woman asking for directions. He shows her the way and asks her out for dinner. When he asks her name she replies that her name is April. At dinner, April's fortune tells her that she will soon recognize a grievous error in judgment, while Harry's message says \\"You're going to die.\\" Outraged, Harry swears at Mr. Lee and causes a scene. April, seeing him for who he truly is, leaves. Mr. Lee tells him the cookie only delivers true fortunes. As he exits the restaurant, Harry is overcome with massive hunger pangs. He finds that he is on a seemingly never-ending street of Chinese restaurants that were not there before. He wanders into one restaurant after another, but is unable to satisfy his hunger. As he continues to endlessly eat, he receives a fortune that informs him why he is perpetually hungry: \\"You're dead.\\" The last scene shows Folger's matchbook graveyard.

Freundt The classification of the pleuropneumonia group of organisms (Borrelomycetales) International Bulletin of Bacteriological Nomenclature and Taxonomy, 1955, 5, 67-78.] (See page 73) in the order Mycoplasmatales. This family consists of the genera Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma. Its type strain is T960. There are two known biovars of this species; T960 and 27. These strains of bacterium are commonly found in the urogenital tracks of human beings, but overgrowth can lead to infections that cause the patient discomfort. Unlike most bacterium, Ureaplasma urealyticum lacks a cell wall making it unique in physiology and medical treatment. Classification The six recognised Ureaplasma species have a GC content of 27 to 30 percent and a genome size ranging from 0.76 to 1.17 million base pairs, and cholesterol is required for growth. A defining characteristic of the genus is that they perform urea hydrolysis, which creates ammonia as a product. Some strains originally classified as U. urealyticum should be treated as a new species, U. parvum. Both strains of Ureaplasma urealyticum have had their DNA sequenced, using a PCR amplification and dideoxy termination method. Their sequences can be accessed through public records and databases. Most of the16S rDNA sequence of the two strains constitute the exact same nucleotides bases (97.3% homology), yet small differences have been acknowledged. Due to the direct similarity and the increased variation in other species of Ureaplasma, it is thought that the two strains of Ureaplasma urealyticum (T960 and 27) have evolutionary diverged together. In the same study conducted, using the same 16s rDNA aligned sequences, they concluded all the mammalian strains diverged and coevolved with their corresponding species (canine, feline, human, bovine) during the Cretaceous period. It was found that the most closely related species strain of Ureaplasma to Ureaplasma urealyticum was Ureaplasma diversum (isolated from bovine).  Clinical relevance  U. urealyticum can cause urethritis and bacterial vaginosis. Infection can occur in extragenital sites.A common symptom associated with these infections is the \\"fishy\\" smell that is created due to the production of ammonia by the hydrolysis or urea. Patients should confirm diagnosis with a doctors visit and seek proper treatment to prevent long-term affects. The bacterium has high correlations with the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). It has also has been linked to infertility in both males and females. In addition, this pathogen may latently infect the chorionic villi tissues of pregnant women, thereby impacting pregnancy outcome. Issues that arise from Ureaplasma urealyticum infections during pregnancy include preterm birth and impacted embryonic development. Some patients have given birth to children subjected to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhaging and necrotizing enterocolitis. Patients can evolve resistances to normal antibiotic treatments due to the distinctive physiology of these organisms. Patients who are pregnant have further limitations on the treatment course of a Ureaplasma urealyticum infection, making it far harder to successfully cure. Alternative treatments are being studied and have shown positive results such as manuka honey.

Jaws is one of the most popular James Bond henchmen and a recurring character in the James Bond video games. He is a highly skilled killer relying on his brute strength and steel teeth to quickly dispatch his victims. Creation The character was inspired by Ian Fleming's description of a hoodlum named Sol \\"Horror\\" Horowitz in his novel The Spy Who Loved Me. When Horror speaks, he reveals steel-capped teeth. The initial script of The Spy Who Loved Me concluded with Jaws being killed by the shark, but after a rough test screening, Jaws was so well-liked that the scene was changed to have him survive. In the storyboard of the sequence from Moonraker (1979), Jaws appears with an Emilio Largo-style eye patch, and a mustache, neither of which was seen in the actual films in which the character appeared. The character's teeth play a prominent role in the films. Albert R. Broccoli is credited with adding steel teeth to the character for The Spy Who Loved Me. Katharina Kubrick Hobbs designed the teeth as cog-like in shape, as he felt that pointed teeth could have injured Kiel.Inside The Spy Who Loved Me. The Spy Who Loved Me Ultimate Edition DVD, Disk 2 Broccoli originally hired John Chambers to make the teeth; however, these were not used, as they did not meet Broccoli's standards. Broccoli then sent Kiel to Peter Thomas, a dental technician who worked near Pinewood Studios, to construct the appliances. Kiel stated the props were uncomfortable for him and he could only wear them for less than one minute before gagging. When Kiel was required to use the teeth to bite through something, liquorice was used. After shooting a scene, the teeth were placed in a plastic container with cotton wool in the bottom of it and the teeth were rinsed with mouthwash before drying for use in the next scene. After the James Bond films, the teeth were taken to an unknown location. In 2002, the teeth were displayed as part of an exhibition at The Science Museum in London to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the release of Dr. No. Appearances =In films= Jaws first appeared in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me as a henchman to the villain, Karl Stromberg. He was an assassin, and is last seen swimming in the ocean after escaping from the Atlantis city ship on which Bond had killed Stromberg before it was torpedoed and sunk. In the next film, Moonraker (1979), Jaws is employed by both Bond's unspecified enemy in the pre-credits sequence, and the main villain Hugo Drax. Jaws is evidently well known amongst criminals, as Drax is pleased to learn that Jaws is available to hire. In his second appearance Jaws changed from a ruthless and unstoppable killing machine to more of a comedic figure (commencing with the cable car sequence) and he eventually turns against Drax and helps Bond to defeat him. In addition to having steel teeth, Jaws was also gigantic and extremely strong, which forced Bond to be especially inventive while fighting him. In combat during The Spy Who Loved Me, Bond found himself caught in an unbreakable death grip by Jaws, who was about to fatally bite him; Bond only escaped by using a broken electric lamp to send an electric shock through the assassin's teeth to stun him. In Moonraker he gains a girlfriend (Dolly) who, like Jaws, seems to almost never speak (she says nothing audible in the film) and who is the primary reason for his reformation. Jaws also has an uncanny ability to survive any misfortune seemingly unscathed and come back to challenge Bond again. In The Spy Who Loved Me, Jaws survives an Egyptian structure's collapse on top of him, being hit by a van, being thrown from a rapidly moving train, sitting in the passenger seat of a car which veers off a cliff in Sardinia and lands in a hut below (to the owner's dismay), a battle underwater with a shark and the destruction of Stromberg's lair. In Moonraker, he survives falling several thousand feet after accidentally disabling his own parachute (he falls through a circus tent and lands in the trapeze net), a crash through a building inside a runaway cable car (where he meets Dolly) and going over Iguazu Falls. After each of these incidents (except the last), he always picks himself up, dusts off his jacket, straightens his tie (in much the same way as Bond himself) and nonchalantly walks away. At the end of the film, Jaws escapes from Drax's disintegrating space station in an escape pod with his girlfriend; they open a bottle of champagne, and Jaws speaks his only line in the entire franchise: \\"Well, here's to us.\\" In 1979 there were plans to bring Jaws back for a third film. In For Your Eyes Only, Jaws would marry Dolly. However, due to a change in production personnel and a desire to make the films more down-to-earth, the producers chose not to bring Kiel or Jaws back. Novelizations Most of the background information on Jaws comes from Christopher Wood's novelisation of the film The Spy Who Loved Me; published as James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me to differentiate from Ian Fleming's novel. In Wood's version, Jaws' real name is Zbigniew Krycsiwiki. He was born in Poland, the product of a union between the strong man of a travelling circus and the Chief Wardress at the Women‚Äôs Prison in Cracow. The relationship and subsequent marriage had been a stormy one and, when it broke up, the young Zbigniew stayed with his mother and attended school and subsequently university in Cracow. He grew to a prodigious height but in temperament he followed his father and was surly and uncooperative, given to sudden outbreaks of violent temper. Because of his size he commanded a place in the university basketball team, but he was sluggish of reaction and his lack of speed was constantly exposed by more skilful but less physically endowed players. After a failed attempt at a basketball career, Krycsiwiki was arrested by the secret police for having taken part in the (fictitious) \\"1972 bread riots\\". While he was imprisoned, the police \\"beat him with hollow steel clubs encased in thick leather\\" until they thought he was dead, leaving his jaw broken beyond repair. Krycsiwiki later escaped and stowed aboard one of Stromberg's vessels. Eventually he was caught, but instead of turning him in, Stromberg hired a prestigious doctor to create an artificial jaw. After 14 operations Krycsiwiki's jaw was restored using steel components that created two rows of terrifying razor-sharp teeth, although Jaws was left mute. Since none of the above is actually mentioned in either movie, this is not necessarily considered canonical, and Wood contradicts his own continuity when one compares his scripts and his novelisations. In the novelisation of The Spy Who Loved Me, Wood specifically states that Jaws is a mute. However, though Jaws remains mute in Wood's James Bond and Moonraker novelisation, he actually does speak at the end of the film. In the book, Jaws remains attached to the magnet that Bond dips into the tank, as opposed to the film where Bond releases Jaws from the magnet into the water: \\"Now both hands were tearing at the magnet, and Jaws twisted furiously like a fish on the hook. As Bond watched in fascinated horror, a relentless triangle streaked up behind the stricken giant. A huge gray force launched itself through the wild water, and two rows of white teeth closed around the threshing flesh.\\" =Other appearances= Jaws appeared in the 1990s animated spin-off James Bond Jr. as a member of the SCUM organization and partner-in-crime of fellow henchman Nick Nack. In the show, Jaws underwent some change in his appearance; he was more muscular, his chin was also metal, and he spoke regularly. Jaws' principal video game appearances are in the 1997 Nintendo 64 game GoldenEye 007 in a bonus mission in which he is a henchman to the deceased Hugo Drax whom Bond needs to defeat, and has multiple appearances in the multi-platform 2004 game 007: Everything or Nothing as a henchman to Nikolai Diavolo. Both games use Richard Kiel's likeness and voice (grunts and sound effects). In Everything or Nothing, Jaws is electrocuted and is inside a train that plummets into a canyon. Later he drives a tanker intending to destroy the New Orleans levees, but Bond destroys his tanker by sending it off of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway; Bond exclaiming, \\"I have a sinking feeling that won't be the last I'll see of him\\". In a fight on a large lift, in which Jaws is equipped with a flamethrower, Bond shoots the flamethrower backpack which ignites Jaws. Bond then climbs into the cockpit of a plane and ejects his seat as the lift plummets to the ground. When Bond subsequently lands on the remains of the lift, Jaws is nowhere to be found, leaving his fate ambiguous. He can not be hurt himself, and any players that try to hurt him will be killed almost immediately by him. Jaws is an unlockable multiplayer character in GoldenEye 007 as well as in 007: Nightfire, where he is the tallest character in the game, his punches can kill almost instantly, and the character model's teeth are visible at close range. Jaws is a playable multiplayer character in the 2010 remake GoldenEye 007 for the Wii, and in the 2011 re-release GoldenEye 007: Reloaded for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. He is also in the 2012 James Bond game 007 Legends. Jaws appears in the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis game James Bond 007: The Duel, where he wanders briefly around a section toward the end of the first stage and defeats the player with one hit. He also serves as the game's final boss. Jaws also appears in the Game Boy game James Bond 007 as a boss, where Bond must lead him to magnetized pads that will temporarily hold him in place, allowing time for Bond to attack him. Cultural impact In the most recent Bond movie Spectre, the henchman Mr Hix (David Bautista) has similarities to Jaws, such as a massive build (though not an actual giant), immense strength and almost no dialog. He also engages Bond in a lengthy fight on a train. Jaws was spoofed in Mel Brooks' 1977 film High Anxiety, featuring a hired killer named Braces (played by Rudy De Luca) who is wearing large metal braces on his teeth. An unrelated character named Braces from the video games TimeSplitters 2 and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect is also referencing Jaws. The film 2008 Get Smart, which is both a parody of and an homage to the James Bond film series, features a character named Dalip (played by The Great Khali), who looks like Jaws and does his Moonraker stunt of falling from the sky without a parachute and surviving; he also helps the film's protagonists in the end. Jaws makes a cameo appearance in the animated series Jackie Chan Adventures (episode \\"Tough Luck\\"), where he auditions as a prospective henchman for Finn and gets his steel teeth (which are revealed to be dentures) stuck in a board he bites into. In the final credits sequence of the film adaptation of Inspector Gadget, Doctor Claw's assistant is shown attending a Henchman's Anonymous meeting; Richard Kiel, who is billed in the credits as \\"Famous Big Guy with Metal Teeth\\", is in attendance. Kiel also played Reace, a very similar character to Jaws (complete with metal teeth), in the 1976 film Silver Streak. In Aces Go Places 3, the third movie in a James Bond spoof series, Kiel plays a villain named Big G, which resembles Jaws, though he has no metal teeth. The film also features an actor who resembles the character Oddjob, another James Bond villain. MythBusters tested the plausibility of Jaws biting through the steel cable car wire. The model based on the dentures used in the movie had little impact on the steel cable, even with a hydraulic press at ten times human bite strength. Jamie Hyneman then took huge metal pincers and became \\"Claws\\", who, as the announcer said, was \\"meaner than Oddjob, more ferocious than Jaws, taller than Nick Nack, and creepier than Tee Hee.\\" With the metal pincers, he gets through the cord easily.

Although wrongful dismissal is usually associated with lack of notice sometimes it can also be caused by arbitrary dismissal where no notice was required but certain grounds were specified in the contract as being the only ones available but none existed.  Definitions  Wrongful dismissal does not terminate the contract - it is a repudiatory breach, i.e. one entitling the employee to consider himself no longer bound on the basis of the employer no longer considering itself bound. The employer's repudiatory breach (wrongful dismissal) forces the employee to accept it as he is prevented from earning from the employer and required to mitigate by working for someone else, thus terminating the contract.Boyo v Lambeth London Borough Council [1994] ICR 727 This does not follow contract law and is an invention by judges, disliked by others, designed to reflect the reality of employment, using the dual fictions that because the right to wages depends on the obligation to work, there is no right to wages if the employer tells the employee not to workGunton v Richmond upon Thames LBC [1980] ICR 755 (forgetting that the employer is not able to terminate the obligation to work other than in accordance with the contract) and that the employee has accepted the repudiation by not working for the employer even though he is willing and able. Otherwise the employee would be entitled to stay at home at the employer's request yet sue for unpaid wages as a debt. An employer is only entitled to dismiss an employee without notice: * in the first month, * if the contract says so, or * if the employee conducts himself so as to undermine the trust and confidence such that the employer should no longer be required to retain the employee in his employment. The last example, trust and confidence, is commonly known as \\"gross misconduct\\", but employment law only distinguishes between misconduct that justifies dismissal and misconduct that does not. Conduct entitling the employer to terminate the contract is conduct indicating the employee no longer considers himself bound by it and so is technically accepting the termination caused by the employee. Gross misconduct is really just a vague list of offences that could most easily justify summary dismissal for a first offence. Dismissal for a reason contrary to statute or contrary to a statutory procedure is described as \\"unfair dismissal\\" but not all wrongful dismissals are unfair dismissals, and dismissal by forcing somebody to resign through serious breach of contract is known as constructive dismissal and constructive dismissal is usually a wrongful dismissal due to lack of notice. =Employer loses restrictive covenants= If an employer dismisses an employee without legally required notice then the employee is usually not bound by restrictive covenantsGeneral Billposting Co Ltd v Atkinson [1909] AC 118 (increasingly though courts treat pay in lieu of notice as curing lack of noticeAbrahams v Performing Rights Society Ltd [1995] ICR 1028). This means the employer of a senior employee privy to company secrets should be careful not to unjustifiably summarily dismiss him, or put him on garden leave or pay him in lieu of notice without a contractual provision allowing it, or even miscalculate his notice period making it a day short. Sometimes an employer can restore such covenants in a compromise agreement by paying a nominal sum of, say, ¬£500 for them. The employer cannot circumvent the risk of a summary dismissal turning out to have been unlawful by giving notice, as that would imply the employee's breach of contract was insufficient to justify summary dismissal. =Notice period= The notice period will usually be in the written agreement, otherwise there are statutory minimums but a court can imply a reasonable period and often will if it thinks the employee has been treated shabbily - for example, one week can turn into a month, and one month can turn into three months. The statutory minima are one week for one month to two years' service then one extra week per year of service from two to twelve years up to a maximum of 12 weeks. The minima will also override contractual provisions if insufficient.Employment Rights Act 1996 s86 Common law notice, used by courts where the contract is silent, depends on the work, seniority, length of service and payment intervals, but not on what the employer can afford;Clark v Fahrenheit 451 (Communications) Ltd EAT/591/99 senior specialists can be given six or even up to twelve months. =Right to work= The employee is always entitled to be paid during his employment and the required notice period; they are often also entitled to work. Requiring the employee to spend the time in leisure (IE at home, on vacation, etc.) in order to \\"get them out of the way\\" can be considered illegal, even though it may be usually considered a benefit to the employee. If an employer wants an exiting employee out of the way and does not have the contractual right to put him on garden leave, or pay him in lieu of notice, then the only options are to encourage the use of holiday and offer a compromise agreement to waive his right to sue, in return for the intentional breach of contract. Sometimes the breach turns the termination payment into compensation rather than wages, making it tax-free, so the employee may be only too happy to go along with the ruse. =Remedies= In a tribunal the remedy would be compensation; in court the remedy would be damages but rarely an injunction. An injunction could be awarded to enforce a contractual disciplinary procedure,Barros D'sa v University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust [2001] EWCA Civ 983 but because compensation is usually an adequate remedy for premature termination, an injunction is generally not available to keep a job going,Marsh v National Autistic Society [1993] ICR 453 even in a redundancy situation where the selection process has been circumvented. Action for wrongful dismissal can be brought within 6 years following the breach of an employment contract. =Compensation= Losses For the notice period the employer must pay wages (including any anticipated pay riseClarke v BET plc [1997] IRLR 348) and benefitsFosca Services (UK) Ltd v Birkett [1996] IRLR 325 except holiday; for wrongful dismissal, it is only possible to claim for lost earningsAddis v Gramophone Co Ltd [1909] and damage to reputation,Malik v Bank of Credit & Commerce International SA [1997] ICR 606 not for the manner of dismissal.Dunnachie v Kingston upon Hull CC [2004] EWCA Civ 84, CA Benefits Benefits include: * pension, * commission accrued and owed,M De Luca v Longbridge International plc 2002 LTL 2 September 2002 * bonus, * overtime, * accrued holiday on unpaid sick leave,Brown v Kigass Aero Components Ltd [2002] IRLR 312 * income protection benefit and personal use of company car (usually running cost or hire car).Shove v Downs Surgical plc [1984] 1 All ER 7 Share options will often be excluded by small print. Bonuses To avoid arguments about whether these would have been earned, it may make sense to compromise by paying the usual sort of overtime or bonus the employee would have gotten if working. Courts are astute to employers trying to wriggle out of paying commission with arguments like \\"it was not triggered because we dismissed him before pay day\\".Brand v Compro Computer Services Ltd [2004] IDS Brief 754 The employer is under a duty to act in good faith,Horkulak v Cantor Fitzgerald [2003] IRLR 765 not to exercise discretion spitefully or in bad faithMidland Bank plc v McCann, EAT 1041/97 and not to act perversely, irrationally or capriciously.Manor House Healthcare v Hayes, EAT 1196/99 Deductions The deductions that can be made from compensation are: * replacement earnings or what the employee should have earned had he bothered to try (failure to mitigate),Yetton v Eastwoods Froy Ltd [1967] 1 WLR 104Hardy v Polk (Leeds) Ltd [2004] IRLR 420 * social security actually receivedSecretary of State for Employment v Stewart [1996] IRLR 334 or which could have been had he bothered to applyWestwood v Secretary of State for Employment [1985] ICR 209 and * compensation already awarded for unfair dismissal under the same heading.O'Laoire v Jackel International Ltd Mitigation Because it is a contract claim, the employee has a duty to mitigate his loss by seeking employment, as soon as possible, for as high a wage as possible;so the tribunal or court would deduct earnings from a new job, during the correct notice period from compensation due, but if the employer attempts to do this unilaterally, it may simply trigger a claim that would not otherwise have happened, had it turned a blind eye to the employee making a couple of weeks' wages out of the situation. Due to the disproportionate cost of employment litigations, it is usually sensible for an employer to err on the side of generosity, trying to ensure the parting of ways is amicable rather than showing off how many loopholes can be found. Pensions cannot be deducted.Parry v Cleaver [1970] AC 1, HL It is possible for a contract to be worded so as to make the pay in lieu of notice a debt, to which the employee is entitled even if he gets a new job the next day.Gregory v Wallace [1998] IRLR 387 Risks =Breaches of contract= Wrongful dismissal is the lesser type of unlawful dismissal, costing only what it would have done to keep the employee during the notice period, but it can be slightly dangerous for the employer, due to the potential loss of restrictive covenants and due to the employee being able to start alleging all sorts of breaches of contract, to try to use up the ¬£25,000 breach of contract allowance in a tribunal, and if he takes the employer to court instead there is no limit and it could end with significantly high costs. Examples Breaches of contract by the employer serious enough to create a wrongful dismissal are also a constructive dismissal; wrongful dismissals not caused by insufficient notice would have been caused by another breach, such as of the duty not to destroy the mutual bond of trust, and have included failure to inform of pension rights.Scally v Southern Health and Social Services Board [1991] ICR 771 The employer has no duty to act what would normally be called in good faith, but must not act in bad faith or insufficiently in good faith such that it breaks the mutual bond of trust.Imperial Group Pension Trust Ltd v Imperial Tobacco Ltd [1991] ICR 524 The obligation is usually not to do anything bad as opposed to doing something good. Losses The employee could allege extra breaches of contract and losses including: * loss of earnings and psychiatrist fees for psychiatric injury caused by wrongful dismissal,Gogay v Hertfordshire CC [2000] IRLR 703 * loss of earnings for the time it would have taken to follow the correct disciplinary procedure, * loss of earnings for unpaid sick leave caused by bullying, * loss of earnings caused by demotion, * loss of earnings caused by stigma of association with a corrupt employer affecting many employees (as opposed to an incident of dishonesty), * redundancy pay lost due to being terminated just before they would have qualified for two years' service, and * loss of health insurance. Defences Successful defences have been: * the employer discovers that the employee was in such serious breach, that he could have been summarily dismissed,Boston Deep Sea Fishing and Ice Co Ltd v Ansell (1888) 39 ChD 339 * the contract allowed dismissal without disciplinary procedure, as long as notice was given or paid in lieu.Bridgen v American Express Bank Ltd [2000] IRLR 94 Relation to unfair dismissal A wrongful dismissal can be a fair or unfair dismissal, just as an unfair dismissal may or may not be a wrongful dismissal in terms of whether the correct notice was given. If the employee had two year's service he could claim unfair dismissal if there was something wrong with the decision to dismiss as opposed to the length of notice. If the wrongfulness was the lack of grounds then is it pretty certain to also be an unfair dismissal. The unfair dismissal claim would, if he is well advised, be in respect of the post-termination period and sue in court for wrongful dismissal in respect of the notice period, thus stretching out the statutory limits by making the unfair dismissal limit only start running from a later date to allow perhaps more loss of earnings and ignoring the breach of contract limit by using the court instead of tribunal to deal with wrongful dismissal. The burden of proving double recovery is on the employer and tribunal awards for unfair dismissal can be vague as to what and when they are for.O'Laoire v Jackel International Ltd (No 2) [1991] ICR 718 Relation to constructive dismissal A wrongful dismissal can be actual or constructive, but a constructive dismissal is almost certain to be a wrongful one, since the correct notice will not have been given if the dismissal was caused by a resignation, itself caused by the employer's serious breach of contract. An employee who was constructively dismissed, as well as possibly having a claim for breach of the duty not to destroy the bond of mutual trust, will usually have a claim for wrongful dismissal. As only economic loss can be claimed for breach of contract, the main loss will be earnings due to the lost notice period, as opposed to any disgruntlement about the manner or reason for dismissal, so the constructive nature of the dismissal tends to disappear into the claim for lost notice period.

Both the square and the basilica are named after Saint Peter, an apostle of Jesus considered by Catholics to be the first Pope. At the centre of the square is an ancient Egyptian obelisk, erected at the current site in 1586. Gian Lorenzo Bernini designed the square almost 100 years later, including the massive Doric colonnades,William Tronzo, ed., St. Peter's in the Vatican, Cambridge University Press, 2005, page 149.Franco Mormondo, Bernini: His Life and His Rome, University of Chicago Press, 2011, page 203. four columns deep, which embrace visitors in \\"the maternal arms of Mother Church\\".

History Fresco of St. Peter's Square c. 1587, before the dome of the new St. Peter's Basilica or the fa√ßade had been built The open space which lies before the basilica was redesigned by Gian Lorenzo Bernini from 1656 to 1667, under the direction of Pope Alexander VII, as an appropriate forecourt, designed \\"so that the greatest number of people could see the Pope give his blessing, either from the middle of the fa√ßade of the church or from a window in the Vatican Palace\\" (Norwich 1975 p 175). Bernini had been working on the interior of St. Peter's for decades; now he gave order to the space with his renowned colonnades, using a simplified Doric order,William Tronzo, ed., St. Peter's in the Vatican, Cambridge University Press, 2005, page 149.Franco Mormondo, Bernini: His Life and His Rome, University of Chicago Press, 2011, page 203. to avoid competing with the palace-like fa√ßade by Carlo Maderno, but he employed it on an unprecedented colossal scale to suit the space and evoke a sense of awe. There were many constraints from existing structures (illustration, right). The massed accretions of the Vatican Palace crowded the space to the right of the basilica's fa√ßade; the structures needed to be masked without obscuring the papal apartments. The obelisk marked a centre, and a granite fountain by MadernoIt was set up in 1613 by order of Paul V stood to one side: Bernini made the fountain appear to be one of the foci of the ovato tondoThe actual foci are marked in the paving by roundels of stone six or seven metres beyond the outer ring of the compass rose centered on the obelisk, on either side.

The trapezoidal shape of the piazza, which creates a heightened perspective for a visitor leaving the basilica and has been praised as a masterstroke of Baroque theater (illustration, below right), is largely a product of site constraints. According to the Lateran Treaty the area of St. Peter's Square is subject to the authority of Italian police for crowd control even though it is a part of the Vatican state. =Colonnades= St. Peter's Square colonnades The colossal Doric colonnades, four columns deep,There are 248 columns and 88 pilasters; 140 over lifesize saints crown the cornice; the coats of arms are of Alexander VII. frame the trapezoidal entrance to the basilica and the massive elliptical areaThe ovato tondo is 240 metres across. which precedes it. The ovato tondo's long axis, parallel to the basilica's fa√ßade, creates a pause in the sequence of forward movements that is characteristic of a Baroque monumental approach. The colonnades define the piazza. The elliptical center of the piazza, which contrasts with the trapezoidal entrance, encloses the visitor with \\"the maternal arms of Mother Church\\" in Bernini's expression. On the south side, the colonnades define and formalize the space, with the Barberini Gardens still rising to a skyline of umbrella pines. On the north side, the colonnade masks an assortment of Vatican structures; the upper stories of the Vatican Palace rise above. =Obelisk= At the center of the ovato tondo stands an uninscribed Egyptian obelisk of red granite, tall, supported on bronze lions and surmounted by the Chigi arms in bronze, in all to the cross on its top. The obelisk was originally erected at Heliopolis, Egypt, by an unknown pharaoh. A reconstruction of the Old Basilica of St Peters in 1450; at left is the obelisk St. Peter's Square obelisk The Emperor Augustus had the obelisk moved to the Julian Forum of Alexandria, where it stood until AD 37, when Caligula ordered the forum demolished and the obelisk transferred to Rome. He had it placed on the spina which ran along the center of the Circus of Nero. It was moved to its current site in 1586 by the engineer-architect Domenico Fontana under the direction of Pope Sixtus V; the engineering feat of re-erecting its vast weight was memorialized in a suite of engravings. The Vatican Obelisk is the only obelisk in Rome that has not toppled since ancient Roman times. During the Middle Ages, the gilt ball on top of the obelisk was believed to contain the ashes of Julius Caesar.Touring Club Italiano, Roma e Dintorni, which furnishes the statistics in these notes. Fontana later removed the ancient metal ball, now in a Rome museum, that stood atop the obelisk and found only dust. Christopher Hibbert writes that the ball was found to be solid. Though Bernini had no influence in the erection of the obelisk, he did use it as the centerpiece of his magnificent piazza, and added the Chigi arms to the top in honor of his patron, Alexander VII. =Paving= The paving is varied by radiating lines in travertine, to relieve what might otherwise be a sea of setts. In 1817 circular stones were set to mark the tip of the obelisk's shadow at noon as the sun entered each of the signs of the zodiac, making the obelisk a gigantic sundial's gnomon. Below is a view of St. Peter's Square from the cupola (the top of the dome) which was taken in June 2007. =Spina= St. Peter's Square today can be reached from the Ponte Sant'Angelo along the grand approach of the Via della Conciliazione (in honor of the Lateran Treaty of 1929). The spina (median with buildings which divided the two roads of Borgo Vecchio and Borgo nuovo) which once occupied this grand avenue leading to the square was demolished ceremonially by Benito Mussolini himself on October 23, 1936 and was completely demolished by October 8, 1937. St. Peter's Basilica was now freely visible from the Castel Sant'Angelo. After the spina, almost all the buildings south of the passetto were demolished between 1937 and 1950, obliterating one of the most important medieval and renaissance quarters of the city. Moreover, the demolition of the spina canceled the characteristic Baroque surprise, nowadays maintained only for visitors coming from Borgo Santo Spirito. The Via della Conciliazione was completed in time for the Great Jubilee of 1950.

Plot summary Sissy Hankshaw, the novel's protagonist, is a woman born with enormously large thumbs who considers her mutation a gift. The novel covers various topics, including free love, feminism, drug use, birds, political rebellion, animal rights, body odor, religion, and yams. Sissy capitalizes on the size of her thumbs by becoming a hitchhiker and subsequently travels to New York. The character becomes a model for The Countess, a male homosexual tycoon of menstrual hygiene products. The Tycoon introduces Sissy to a staid Mohawk named Julian Gitche, whom she later marries. In her later travels, she encounters, among many others, a sexually open cowgirl named Bonanza Jellybean and an itinerant escapee from a Japanese internment camp happily mislabeled The Chink. The Chink is presented as a hermetic mystic and, at one point writes on a cave wall, \\"I believe in everything; nothing is sacred. I believe in nothing; everything is sacred.\\" and frequently says \\"Ha Ha Ho Ho and Hee Hee.\\" A flock of whooping cranes also makes frequent appearances throughout the novel, which includes details of their physical characteristics and migratory patterns. Robbins also inserts himself into the novel (as a character). Film, TV or theatrical adaptations The novel was made into a 1993 film directed by Gus Van Sant and starring Uma Thurman, Lorraine Bracco, Pat Morita, Angie Dickinson, Keanu Reeves, John Hurt, Rain Phoenix, Ed Begley, Jr., Carol Kane, Victoria Williams, Sean Young, Crispin Glover, Roseanne Arnold, Buck Henry, Grace Zabriskie, and Treva Jeffryes. Robbins himself was the narrator. Literary significance and criticism \\"Cowgirls ...\\" has been considered by Gus Van Sant to be a 'hippy' novel. Robbins writes short chapters filled with philosophical asides and quips (such as noting that because amoebae reproduce by binary fission, the first amoeba is still alive), often speaking to the reader (chapter 88 begins with the narrator noting that the book now has as many chapters as a piano has keys). In popular culture * John Cale, formerly of The Velvet Underground, named a song and album after the novel. * The band Nightmare of You based the song \\"Thumbelina\\" on the book. * The band The Gaslight Anthem titled a song on their album The '59 Sound after the novel. * Rodney Crowell named a song after the novel that was recorded by Emmylou Harris on her Blue Kentucky Girl album. * James Lee Stanley released an album of the same name, intended as a soundtrack to the novel. * Matthew Milia of the band Frontier Ruckus released a mixtape titled \\"Even F*ckboys Get the Blues\\", a play on the novel's title. Development history The novel was originally to be published by Doubleday as they had right-of-first-refusal to Robbins's second book. However Robbins terminated his contract with Doubleday for a better offer from editor Ted Solotaroff and Bantam Books. Bantam was mass-paperback publisher, and they auctioned the rights for hardcover to Houghton Mifflin. =Partial publication history= Even Cowgirls Get the Blues was first published in 1976 by Houghton Mifflin.

Black Repartition (BR) was established in August-September 1879 after the split of Zemlya i volya (Land and Liberty). The name comes from the Russian countryside, where rumors circulated among peasants about the approaching repartition. \\"Chyornyi\\" in this context does not literally mean \\"black\\" but \\"universal\\". Originally, the BR members shared the ideas of Zemlya i volya, renounced the necessity of political struggle and were against terror and conspiracy tactics of Narodnaya Volya. BR preferred propaganda and agitation ('agitprop') as their tactics. The organizers of BR‚Äôs central body in Saint Petersburg were Georgi Plekhanov, Pavel Akselrod, Osip Aptekman, Lev Deich, Vera Zasulich and others. This group organized a print shop and started publishing magazines Black repartition and Core (–ó–µ—Ä–Ω–æ, or Zerno), simultaneously developing ties with students and workers. BR‚Äôs peripheral organs were active in Moscow, Kharkov, Kazan, Perm, Saratov, Samara and other cities. After Plekhanov, Deich, Zasulich and some other BR members had emigrated in the beginning of 1880, Anatoly Bulanov, M.Reshko, K.Zagorsky, M.Sheftel and others replaced them as BR‚Äôs leaders. They opened a new printing-house in Minsk and widened their contacts with workers. BR‚Äôs central body moved to Moscow. In the spring of 1880, BR members Yelizaveta Kovalskaya and Nikolai Schedrin organized the Worker‚Äôs Union of Southern Russia (–Æ–∂–Ω–æ—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∏–π —Å–æ—é–∑, or Yuzhnorusskiy rabochiy soyuz), which comprised several hundreds of workers. By this time, BR‚Äôs vision of revolution had changed in a number of ways. The arrests in 1880-1881 significantly weakened the organization. Seeing the success of Narodnaya Volya, many BR members (Yakov Stefanovich, Bulanov and others) adopted its ideology. By the end of 1881, BR ceased to exist as an organization but separate BR clubs continued to operate up until the mid-1880s. Plekhanov, Deich, Zasulich and other ex-members of BR took sides with Marxism and created the first Russian Marxist organization called Emancipation of Labor (–û—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ç—Ä—É–¥–∞, or Osvobozhdeniye truda) in Geneva in 1883.

Contrary to its name, it is not a separate addressing mode that the x86 processors can operate in. It is used in the 80286 and later x86 processors. Overview For efficiency reasons, the 80286 and all later x86 processors use the base address, size and other attributes stored in their internal segment descriptor cache whenever computing effective memory addresses, even in real mode. Therefore a modification of the internal segment descriptor allows to alter some properties of segments in real mode, like the size of addressable memory. This technique became widely used and is supported by all Intel processors. HIMEM.SYS uses this feature to address extended memory, unless DOS is switched to run in a virtual 8086 mode that is incompatible with unreal mode. One of the very few games‚Äîif not the only one‚Äîthat used unreal mode was Ultima VII. Unreal mode is still used by BIOS code as this is the initial mode of modern Intel processors. Furthermore, the System Management Mode (SMM) in Intel 386SL and later processors places the processor in unreal mode. A program in unreal mode can call 16-bit code programmed for real mode (BIOS, DOS kernel and drivers) without any thunking. This makes an unreal mode driver simpler than a DPMI driver. However unreal mode is incompatible with protected mode operating systems such as Windows 3.x/9x/NT and OS/2. Enabling unreal mode To put an 80386 or higher microprocessor into unreal mode, a program must first enter protected mode, find or create a flat descriptor in the GDT or LDT, load some of the data segment registers with the respective protected mode \\"selector\\", and then switch back to real mode. After returning to real mode, the processor will continue using the cached descriptors as established in protected mode, thus allowing access to 4 GiB of extended memory from real mode. The 80286 microprocessor can be put into unreal mode only with help of the undocumented instruction LOADALL to modify the hidden segment base registers to point to the source or target memory location above 1 MiB. Starting with the 80386, real mode programs can use the 32 bit registers with the Address Size Override Prefix. This allows programs to use an address like DS:[EBX]. In normal real mode, a fault occurs if EBX exceeds 0xFFFF. In unreal mode, the access is allowed. Variants of unreal mode As described above, unreal mode usually involves using one or more data selectors to address data in memory more efficiently. This has been common practice and often referred to as \\"flat real mode\\" or \\"big real mode\\". The \\"huge real mode\\" is a variant where also the code segment is extended to 4 GiB. A special case of unreal mode is attained by, in addition, loading the code selector (CS) from a descriptor having the 32-bit attribute (\\"D\\" bit) set to one. This rarely used variant presents some advantages, mainly because it allows avoiding the Operand Size Override Prefixes normally required when using 32-bit addressing in 16-bit code segment, but it is more difficult to set up. Since real mode interrupts do not automatically preserve the high sixteen bits of the extended instruction pointer (EIP), the code needs to either fit in the low portion of code segment or be able to preserve and restore the high bits of EIP in some way. In addition, if BIOS or DOS interrupt functions that use 16-bit code are to be called, mode switching is required to switch the \\"D\\" bit back and forth. Some emulators do not support emulation of programs running in this variant of unreal mode.

Opening narration Plot Cat burglar Jackie Thompson breaks into a museum late one night and steals a rare stone from a display case. After tripping the alarm, he gets shot by a security guard, but is amazed to discover that the stolen stone heals him. Jack escapes and heads back to his apartment, where he studies the stone. Hearing a commotion in the hallway, he discovers that his friendly neighbor Harry is having a heart attack. One of the other neighbors is attempting CPR but to no avail. Thinking quickly, Jackie runs over and while grasping the stone touches Harry's chest and begs for healing. Harry makes a full recovery. Harry tells Jackie everything he saw while he was unconscious-- about floating over the neighbors and how he seemed to get pulled back into his own body. Harry tells Jackie that they could make a fortune with that kind of power, and Jackie soon becomes \\"Brother John,\\" a healer on a TV ministry. Harry, who is only interested in the money, acts as his business manager, but Jackie truly feels altruistic and enjoys helping others. Duende, a Native American man, appears one day and states that his people loaned the stone to the museum and warns Jackie that he is traveling down the wrong path. While Jackie is inclined to return the stone, Harry disagrees and tells him not to do it due to their good fortune. Living in a palatial house and having more money than he needs, it becomes apparent that Jackie truly wants to give back the stone, but Harry continues to convince him otherwise. One day, Joseph Rubello, a drug lord from Jackie's past, begs him to heal his terminal cancer. Because Rubello treated him horribly in the past, Jackie demands $2 million to heal him, and while Rubello agrees to his demands, they both find that the stone no longer works. Later at the TV ministry, Jackie fails to heal a deaf boy and his old bullet wound opens and begins bleeding profusely. Duende reappears and explains that the stone only works when used unselfishly. Harry refuses to help Jackie, and instead plans to take all the money for himself. The deaf boy follows Jackie outside and he hands the stone to the boy, who heals him in return. Jackie then gives the boy back his hearing and, with his redemption complete, gives the stone to Duende who will return it to his people. Duende takes the boy to his mother and Jackie smiles, knowing he did the right thing.

Opening narration Plot Day 1: Someday Peter Jay Novins is at a bar and attempts to call someone but accidentally dials his own home phone number. The phone is answered by someone who claims to be Peter Jay Novins. Peter has a casual conversation with himself thinking the strange circumstance is a joke, but eventually hangs up the phone in shock. Flustered, he leaves the bar and uses a phone booth to call his house. He gets himself again and begins to believe that the man on the other end of the line is his own alter ego. Peter thinks about heading over to his apartment, but the man on the phone warns him against it. Peter then asks if the two of them could just lead normal lives. The man on the phone tells him that because Peter's life is terrible, he is going to change it. Peter threatens the man on the phone and hangs up. Day 2: Duesday The next day, Peter cashes out his bank account, calls the grocery store and insults them to ensure that his alter ego cannot get any food delivered and then calls his apartment again. The man on the other end tells him that Peter is too late because he used the $200 that was stashed away to buy enough groceries to hold him for a while. The man on the phone tells Peter his situation is similar to what happened in the Jack London novel The Star Rover, and explains that the character in the novel used astral projection to leave his body. He figures that Peter is a piece of him that wandered off while he was sleeping and claims that he is in fact the real Peter. Peter, however, thinks that it's possible that when he went to a friend's lab and a picture of his \\"aura\\" was taken it somehow \\"stole\\" something from him. The man also tells Peter his estranged mother phoned to attempt patch things up and that the man has invited her to live with him. Angry at the prospect of his alter ego stealing his mother, Peter hangs up. Day 3: Woundsday During a storm, a sick Peter stares into his apartment from the street. From a pay phone, he calls the man who claims to be the other Peter and says he wants to work things out. The other Peter says that the more deserving of them should take over his life. Other Peter also reveals that he turned down an unethical advertising job that Peter had previously accepted. When Peter asks why he has done this, the other Peter tells him that he did this to himself. Day 5: Freeday Peter sits in a hotel room growing sicker. He receives a phone call from other Peter, who tells him that he tried to make amends with an ex-girlfriend of his who left her husband to pursue their affair. The other Peter reminds him that when he had put the woman and her child up in an apartment, he eventually dumped her when he got bored of their relationship, which was cruel. Other Peter then goes on to tell him that he had a long discussion with his current girlfriend and that she was ready to leave him, but other Peter convinced her that their relationship was worth saving. Other Peter tells Peter he plans on marrying her and having children‚Äîsomething Peter had apparently not considered. Day 6: Shatterday Other Peter finally visits a very ill Peter, who is lying in a hotel room wracked with sickness. Other Peter tells him that it is time to come to terms with the fact that he is being replaced and that he is becoming a memory. Peter goes to the window and stares out with forlorn ambivalence. Other Peter reveals that things are going well with him and that he has put his life in order‚Äîsomething Peter failed to do. He asks Peter if there is anything he would have done differently. Peter says no. As other Peter leaves, Peter wishes him well, shakes his hand, and then disappears.

The episode is based on the short story \\"Wong's Lost and Found Emporium\\", by William F. Wu, first published in Amazing Stories in May, 1983.  Opening narration Plot David Wong (Brian Tochi), a young Asian American, has spent three years looking for a mysterious place called \\"The Lost and Found Emporium.\\" He finally tracks it down in a backroom of a sleazy San Francisco porn shop. Once inside, he finds that the place has no owner or any staff. Browsing around, David meets an elderly woman who is looking for lost time. He is not interested in her story, but suddenly, he sees an orb of light which is trying to point him to something. Following the orb, which the woman does not see, he finds a cage with mice that have instructions to rub them until they calm down. Believing this is her chance to win back her lost time, the woman tries to do so but mice scatter and hide. She breaks down in tears and David makes a condescending remark. The next person David meets is an elderly man who came to the emporium by accident. He eventually admits he lost the respect of his children and David grudgingly points him (with help of the orb) to a mirror, which he must look at for no less than five and a half minutes. The man begins this procedure but is disgusted by what he sees-‚Äîa distorted, monstrous image of him. Unable to control himself, he smashes the mirror and then realizes what he has done. Just like with the old woman, David merely shakes his head and leaves. As he is walking away from the man, David is confronted by Melinda who scolds him for his lack of compassion. David admits that it is his compassion he is after and explains how he lost it years ago due to racial intolerance. He mentions the murder of Vincent Chin, which was an important event for the Asian-American community in the USA. Melinda offers him a deal‚Äî-she will find his compassion if he finds her lost item (which she refuses to reveal). David agrees and follows the orb to an old thermos, which releases a stream of vapor. After inhaling the vapor, Melinda receives back her sense of humor. She points David to three flasks, one of which contain his compassion. Unable to choose, David smashes the two biggest flasks, regaining his integrity and childhood memories. The third flask (a small white test tube) rolls away from him and is lost for good. David is unhappy, but realizes he did gain back much in the way of who he was. Compassion, to some extent, came along with it. Feeling like a man reborn, David realizes it is destiny to help other unfortunate souls. Melinda agrees to stay with him as his assistant. They start their journey by helping the elderly man and woman, as even lost chances can be recovered.

After being told that he will be executed, he laughs in disbelief. He tells the judge that his execution won't matter because he is only dreaming. After returning to his cell, Grant continues talking about his dream. Of course, his fellow inmates don't believe what he's saying, even after Grant is able to provide detailed accounts of what it feels like to be executed each night. While Grant is in his cell, prosecutor Mark Ritchie (Guy Boyd) ponders the case. Ritchie's wife Carol (Deborah May) attempts to distract him but then Grant's attorney Erin Jacobs (Janet Eilber) shows up and tries to explain that Grant may be telling the truth despite the overwhelming evidence against him. For evidence, Jacobs asks why there was no press in or around the courtroom despite this being a murder trial. Ritchie is puzzled by this notion. Ritchie visits Grant and claims that he is using a crazy dream theory to try to fool everyone, even though Grant can lip-sync everything Ritchie says to him. Grant asks Ritchie if he is to be executed today, which is the right day for executions (Mondays at 12:01 am), then how is it that he was sentenced on a Sunday, as courts do not operate on Sundays. Grant then mentions Carol who is the only person who never changes in the dream because she is in fact Grant's sister in reality. Grant even knows what Carol told Ritchie earlier that evening which makes Ritchie panic and leave. The execution proceedings begin and a priest visits Grant in his cell. Grant claims that the priest is actually his own father who died years ago. Meanwhile, Ritchie frantically tries to get a stay of execution, and just as the governor calls the execution chamber - the switch is thrown.

He laughs it off and orders another drink, but when the bartender makes last call Miley realizes he brought in a pizza he was supposed to bring home for dinner‚Äîfive hours ago. After he gets home his son asks if he is sick again, while his wife gives him an ultimatum. In lieu of divorce and losing his child, Miley decides on trying the Hellgramite Method, which was advertised on his box of matches. Miley visits the home of Dr. Eugene Murrick who offers him a red pill. He takes the pill and Dr. Murrick sends him home as that is all it takes‚Äîfor now. He returns to his favorite bar only to discover that alcohol has no effect on him anymore. After drinking enough booze to knock out a normal man, he doesn't even have a buzz. He then goes to Murrick to discover why he can no longer become intoxicated. It turns out that the pill contained a Hellgramite, a tapeworm that absorbs all traces of alcohol in a person, thus rendering the individual sober no matter how much they drink; but since it feeds on alcohol it will grow larger in his stomach and kill him if he continues to drink. The only solution is to starve the tapeworm, but to do so invites painful withdrawals. If he can endure the withdrawal pains, the tapeworm will eventually be forced into a hibernation state, thus giving a measure of freedom to the host. But if he ever drinks another drop of alcohol the tapeworm will re-awaken and grow. At home, Miley determines to starve the tapeworm. In order to succeed and not frighten his family, he sends them away for a couple of weeks and dumps all of the alcohol in the house down the drain. As the days pass, he undergoes ever-increasing pain until he is in agony. Miley goes to Murrick and begs him for help, but Murrick feels no pity, as it is nowhere near the pain Murrick felt when he lost his family. A drunk driver was responsible for killing Murrick's wife and two children as they tried to cross the street. At home again, Miley is near the brink of insanity from the pain exposing his torso to reveal the worm shifting and moving under the skin. Later at the bar Miley used to frequent, he approaches a man and offers him matches with the Hellgramite Method advertised on the box. He's now well-dressed and self-confident and he walks to the bartender and pays his tab. The bartender offers him a drink on the house but Miley declines and walks out of the bar into the sunlight.

Every object of mass in space, for instance, exerts a field force on all other objects of mass, according to Newton's law of universal gravitation. Because this force exerted by one object affects the motion of the other, it can be said that these two objects are in causal contact. The only objects not in causal contact are those for which there is no event in the history of the universe that could have sent a beam of light to both. For example, if the universe were not expanding and had existed for 10 billion years, anything more than 20 billion light-years away from the earth would not be in causal contact with it. Anything less than 20 billion light-years away would because an event occurring 10 billion years in the past that was 10 billion light-years away from both the earth and the object under question could have affected both. A worldline through a light cone in 2D space plus a time dimension. A good illustration of this principle is the light cone, which is constructed as follows. Taking as event p a flash of light (light pulse) at time t_0, all events that can be reached by this pulse from p form the future light cone of p, whilst those events that can send a light pulse to p form the past light cone of p. Given an event E, the light cone classifies all events in spacetime into 5 distinct categories: * Events on the future light cone of E. * Events on the past light cone of E. * Events inside the future light cone of E are those affected by the beam of light emitted at E. * Events inside the past light cone of E are those that can emit a beam of light and affect what is happening at E. * All other events are in the (absolute) elsewhere of E and are those that will never affect and can never be affected by E.

He was living at 14 Wadham Street in Weston-super-Mare. Dr. Hitchins stated that Maclean was complaining of headaches and believed that all the people in England are against him, and he felt he must injure someone because they are conspiring to deceive him. He had also sent letters to his sister in 1880, Caroline Maclean, stating that, \\"If I cannot commit a murder one way, I will another way, and all can add is, if there is more difficulty, there may be more victims.\\" Multiple doctors also testified that Maclean was insane and \\"did not believe he was capable of appreciating the nature or quality of any act which he might commit.\\" Tried for high treason on 20 April, the Scotsman was found \\"not guilty, but insane\\" by a jury after five minutes' deliberation, overseen by Lord Chief Justice Coleridge. and he lived out his remaining days in Broadmoor Asylum. The verdict prompted the Queen to ask for a change in English law so that those implicated in cases with similar outcomes would be considered as \\"guilty, but insane\\"; this led to the Trial of Lunatics Act 1883. A poem was later written about Maclean's attempt on the Queen's life by William Topaz McGonagall.

The collectivisation of private and state owned agricultural land in East Germany was the progression of a policy of food security (at the expense of large scale bourgeois farmers). It began in the years of Soviet occupation (1945‚Äì48) as part of the need to govern resources in the Soviet Sector. Beginning with the forced expropriation of all land holdings in excess of , land was redistributed in small packets of around to incoming landless refugees driven off formerly German-held territories to the east. These Neubauern (new farmers) were given limited ownership rights to the land, meaning that they kept it as long as they worked it. In the early 1950s, remaining farmers with largish holdings () were effectively driven out of business through means such as denying access to pooled machinery and by setting production targets that rose exponentially with amount of land owned to levels that were impossible to meet. Alongside these coercive actions of expropriation, old and new farmers with smaller land holdings were increasingly encouraged to pool resources in a legally constituted cooperative form, the LPG, in which initially just land but later animals and machinery were shared and worked together. These were not \\"state- owned\\" farms (although a few of these did exist) - land, except as mentioned above, remained legally in private ownership and the LPG, although often dominated by communist party cadres, was a distinct legal entity operating independently as far as was feasible within the constraints of a planned economy. However, from the early 1960s, pressure mounted on remaining independent farmers to join the LPGs and for existing LPGs to merge in more fully collectivised forms. This process, and a drive to increased industrialisation, led in the 1970s to the separation of crop and animal production and the merging of each across villages to form much larger cooperative units in which, for example, one LPG for crop production with perhaps of land would supply feed to two LPGs working in animal production. Following German reunification in 1990, the LPG was no longer a legal form of business and regulations were introduced governing their dissolution and the restructuring of enterprises into other legal forms. Some former LPG members, typically those with a strong family background in independent farming, reclaimed their land and started again as independent farmers building up to a viable farm size through renting. In most cases, however, former members or their children settled for some level of compensation in return for surrendering their membership rights to a smaller core group of former managers who then took over the business in the new form of a limited company (GmbH). This settlement and compensation process was at times fought over and at times accepted with resignation depending often on the amount of wealth to be distributed and on the degree of trust by the general membership and village population in the ability of managers to carry on the enterprise as successful employers. In some cases, an eingetragene Genossenschaft, a form of cooperative farming, persisted as allowed under existing German law.

Opening narration Plot Callous businessman Tom Bennett returns to his office after recovering from a heart transplant. At the party given to celebrate his return he wants it ended quickly as he becomes embarrassed at the attention. Tom turns his attention to a building his firm is contracted to build, and during a meeting to discuss it he suddenly acts odd - at least to his colleagues Spence and Julie. He suddenly becomes obsessed with buying a pair of boots and then buys his colleague Julie a hot dog for lunch. They take a walk on a beach and run into a sad-looking young woman with whom he is instantly drawn. Later, at the office, he tells his secretary to order some plants to which she comments that he always hated plants. On a drive through the city with his other colleague, Spence looks for a place to eat and they end up leaving the city and find a diner. This diner happens to be the workplace of the woman he ran into at the beach. The woman's name is Mary Jo and she is mystified and can't understand his instant attraction to her. He's persistent but she rejects his forwardness. Her friend at work tries to talk her into accepting his offer of dinner. Julie, who has had an on-again, off- again relationship with Tom, gets jealous and confronts Tom about his obsession with Mary Jo. When he tries again, Tom is told by her work friend that Mary Jo is still grieving due to the loss of her boyfriend Jamie Adler, who died in a car accident. When Mary Jo finally talks to Tom, she explains how she and Jamie knew each other since they were kids and they always knew they'd be together. They were making plans to get married when the accident occurred, and she tells him that someone received his heart. Tom then realizes that it was Jamie's heart that he received for his transplant. At work, Tom begins slipping in his \\"shark-like\\" attitude toward business, but he doesn't seem to care. The next day, Tom drives to the diner dressed in jeans and T-shirt and in a pick-up truck. He sits and waits for Mary Jo all night. She finally decides to talk to him and he tells her about his heart transplant. He confesses that before the transplant he was not a nice person, but now he has been given a second chance. Tom says he will wait for her as long as it takes and he orders her favorite dessert for her. She asks how he knew and he simply shrugs and smiles, promising that he will be there for her just like Jamie.

Nurse Claire Hendricks attempts to help her but the woman is rude and insistent on only seeing the doctor. Before long, the doctor arrives, but it is too late‚Äîthe woman is now blind from cataracts. In another instance, an elderly man is desperately trying to get Claire to help his wife but she claims that hospital policy forces her to be unhelpful; however, it's clear she is an uncaring person. The blind woman, Mrs. Reed, wants Claire to come visit her, but Claire is apprehensive and negative. Mrs. Reed admits that she's beginning to realize what's happening and that she \\"sees\\" a lot of herself in Claire. She apparently wanted to warn her of something but Claire dismisses her and leaves. Mr. Reed shows up at the hospital blind as well. It is discovered that Mrs. Reed, in her own selfishness, knew she was going blind and abandoned him to get help for herself. Suddenly, more and more people show up blind from spontaneous cataract development. An epidemic ensues from coast to coast, and Claire, despite her incredible workload now, visits with Mrs. Reed again. Mr. Reed talks about how much they are alike and he also claims the blindness is happening because humans have become monkeys‚Äîsee no evil, speak no evil, etc. Humans have become such an uncaring society, he says, and since we have turned a blind eye to suffering - nature has turned a blind eye to us. Soon, a report surfaces that an explosion at a bio-weapons facility may be responsible for the blindness but Claire starts to realize that Mrs. Reed might be right. Claire soon succumbs to blindness. News arrives about a surgery that will cure the blind and Mrs. Reed visits with Claire and they discuss the surgery. Mrs. Reed and others will get their sight back, but when she asks Claire when her surgery will take place Claire says she will not undergo it. She believes in what Mrs. Reed said and thinks that no surgery will ever help her. The doctor says Claire will see again but it will take her a little longer, as Claire's eyes are clear and her blindness is psychosomatic.

Opening narration Plot Gary Pitkin, an Elvis impersonator, opens his show in a smoke-filled lounge by singing \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" in Elvis's signature 1950s gold lam√© suit. Much to Gary's chagrin, his performance receives mediocre applause. Afterward, Gary is in his dressing room when his manager Sandra enters and tells Gary that she was able to book him into a small hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. The mere mention of Las Vegas drives Gary into a rant about how Vegas killed Elvis. He laments about how it was great music, but she reminds him that while it was, it still wasn't \\"his\\" music. Sandra then mentions that she once met the real Elvis years ago after he picked her out of an audience. He took her back to his hotel room where he began acting strange and gave a bizarre, paranoid rant. Gary remarks that Elvis \\"got weird\\" towards the end of his life. As Gary is driving home, he sees an incoherent driver coming the opposite direction. To avoid hitting the driver, Gary steers off the road only to get into an accident. Gary awakes the next morning and sees the damage done to his car, grabs his guitar, and starts thumbing for a ride. A man in an old pickup truck sees Gary and pulls over. To Gary's shock, the man resembles Elvis. He offers Gary a ride and Gary notices a sign on the door that reads \\"Crown Electric Co.\\", which was the company Elvis worked for before getting his first recording contract. They break the ice by talking about how they're both musicians. As they're talking, Gary looks over and sees an old Chrysler DeSoto drive by and then picks up a newspaper from the floor. The date reads: July 3, 1954. Gary comes to the realization that the man sitting next to him not only looks like Elvis Presley but that he actually is Presley. Gary begins to believe that all of this is a hallucination resulting from his accident. When they arrive at Crown Electric, Elvis's boss comes out and chides him about picking up hitchhikers \\"even if it's your brother.\\" Elvis begins to question Gary about who he is and where he comes from and he then uses Elvis's belief in the supernatural to convince him that he is Jesse (Elvis's twin brother who died at birth). Elvis, thinking that Gary is his thought-to-be-deceased twin, asks him why he came back. Gary tells him that he came back to help him because he was going to be bigger than he could ever imagine. Gary starts listing all the positives of Elvis's future career and then he starts listing all the negatives, but affirms that it doesn't have to be that way. Feeling remorseful about deceiving Elvis, Gary begins to back out, until Elvis asks to meet him the next day so that he could help him rehearse the song he was going to record for Mr. Phillips. Gary agrees. The next day, Gary continues to tell Elvis about his future success and how he is going to be the King of Rock 'n' Roll. Elvis starts playing an easy-listening ballad called \\"I Love You Because\\" with his guitar. Gary is disappointed with Elvis's choice of song and attempts to convince him to play \\"That's All Right\\" and even moves around and shakes his hips. Elvis is horrified and claims that it's the devil's music and even accuses Gary of deviltry. The two break into an argument that leads to a brawl, and Elvis grabs a guitar to swing at Gary, but he misses and hits the edge of a shelf instead, breaking off the top part of the guitar's neck. As they continue to fight, Elvis leaps towards him and accidentally lands on the broken guitar when Gary moves out of the way. The guitar goes right through Elvis's chest and he dies. With no other alternative, Gary buries Elvis and wonders about his future. He thinks about it and decides from that point on to assume Elvis's identity and to do everything just the way Elvis did. The following day, a nervous Gary (wearing Elvis's clothes from the day before) goes into Sun Studio and is received by the office manager who lets him know that everyone is already waiting for him in the recording booth. As Sam Phillips is preparing his recording equipment, Gary plays a little of \\"That's All Right\\" to the other band members who immediately join in with the song. Phillips interrupts the trio but tells Gary to keep playing. As he plays the song, the scene flashes forward to 1970s Las Vegas where Gary talks to a woman in his hotel room. He tells her that he did all the songs and all the moves as closely as he remembered. He questions whether or not the real Elvis would've been a better King than he would've been or if there would've even been a King at all. He says that he has terrible dreams and that he talks to Elvis all the time, who tells him that he still owes him for what he did. He even goes as far as to say Elvis would have liked Vegas. The woman turns out to be a young Sandra. She tells him that he is tired and not to worry about it and no one could ever take his place. He was the King and the only King. He then sends her off with a kiss, and after she leaves Gary sits in front of a window facing the Vegas Strip. Closing narration Production A title card comes up at the end of the episode thanking the Elvis Presley estate for permission to use Elvis' likeness and songs for this episode. Elvis's boss at the Crown Electric Company was played by Red West, Elvis's real-life schoolmate and best friend. Also, the newspaper that Gary picks up in Elvis' truck to find out the date is labeled The Commercial Appeal, the real newspaper of Memphis, Tennessee. Elvis's vocals were performed by Ronnie McDowell, who also performed Elvis's vocals for several TV miniseries and films, including the 1979 biopic Elvis, starring Kurt Russell.

It uses lasers and blank cartridges to simulate actual battle. Individual soldiers carry small laser sensors scattered over their bodies, which detect when the soldier has been illuminated by a firearm's laser. Each laser transmitter is set to mimic the effective range of the weapon on which it is used. When a person is \\"hit\\", a medic can use the digital readout to determine which first aid method to practice. Different versions of MILES systems are available to both US and international militaries. The capabilities of the individual systems can vary significantly but in general all modern systems carry information about the shooter, weapon and ammunition in the laser. When this information is received by the target, the target's MILES system uses a random number roll and a casualty probability lookup table to determine the outcome. For example, a MILES transmitter emulating an M16 rifle cannot harm an armored personnel carrier (APC), but could still \\"kill\\" a commander visible in the hatch of the vehicle. Vehicles are typically outfitted with a belt of laser sensors or individual wireless detectors. Dismounted soldiers often wear a vest or harness with sensors as well as a \\"halo\\" of sensors on their helmets. MILES systems can be coupled with a real-time data link allowing position and event data to be transmitted back to a central site for data collection and display. More sophisticated systems for tanks and APCs exist that use various techniques (including scanning lasers and coupled radio systems) to allow more precise targeting of armored vehicles. The standard is maintained by the U.S. Army's PEO-STRI branch. Early versions MILES simulation (note the laser emitters attached to the rifles' barrels, and the laser receptors on the soldiers' helmets and harnesses). Polish Soldier with MILES gear, AKMS and three magazines taped together jungle style. MILES was introduced to the U.S. Army for direct-fire, force-on-force training capability at home stations and combat training centers during operational testing in 1978 and 1979 following the conclusion of the US Army's Engineering Development program awarded to Xerox Electro-Optical Systems. The goal of the program was to design and build a tactical training system that simulates the weapons, weapon characteristics and effects of a family of weapon systems including infantry, armor and aircraft, with an initial design of 11 systems including rifles, tank guns, and missiles.Trainer Engineering Report for MILES, Vol. I, Xerox Electro-Optical Systems, Contract No. N61139-76-C-0060 MILES systems used a laser module which was mounted to the barrel of a real weapon, a blank-firing adaptor for the weapon, and an integrated receiver consisting of sensors on the helmet and load-bearing vests of the soldiers. When a blank shot was fired by a weapon, it caused the laser to fire a coded burst in the direction that the weapon was aimed. If that burst was sensed by the receiver of another soldier, the \\"hit\\" soldier's gear beacon made a beeping noise to let them know they were \\"dead\\". MILES had serious problems‚Äîwhen hit, the receiver did not prevent the further firing of the weapon, and it was tempting and easy for soldiers to \\"cheat\\" by turning the receivers off and back on again, resetting the system and therefore \\"respawning\\" or \\"resurrecting\\" themselves. In addition, no data about the engagement was kept so it was impossible to positively identify who shot whom on the battlefield, a critical piece of information when attempting to develop new tactics. MILES was also very encumbering and soldiers sometimes experienced neck pain when using it. In 1981, Simulaser Corporation was founded by two entrepreneur engineers and began operations near Los Angeles to develop \\"Advanced MILES\\" training systems.\\"The New Entrepreneurs,\\" Electronic Engineering Times, July 19, 1982 Under initial contracts from Sandia National Labs, Simulaser produced standard MILES replacement laser transmitters and man-worn detector systems as well as \\"Advanced MILES\\" devices that incorporated player identification and scoring systems. These Advanced MILES systems made use of the CMOS 146800-series embedded controllers that had just become available at that time. The systems interleaved unique player identification codes within the weapon code bits transmitted by the laser, which were then stored by the receiver system of any player that was hit.\\"Laser Battlefield Simulation Reaches New Levels of Sophistication\\", Military Electronics/Countermeasures, February 1983 Those systems utilized a controller gun to initialize each player, thus preventing players from \\"resurrecting\\" themselves by re-inserting the yellow weapon key. Each player's data was stored in memory until downloaded by the controller unit at the conclusion of the training exercise. Simulaser made use of hybrid microcircuits to reduce the size of certain components and eliminated the electronic module on the back of the helmet to improve player comfort. Simulaser also manufactured laser detector components and systems for vehicle applications sold to Sandia Labs and EG&G; Inc., the operations and maintenance contractor at Kirtland AFB for use in training guards and couriers. Simulaser was acquired by Applied Solar Energy Corp. (ASEC, City of Industry, CA), its major supplier of silicon detectors, in 1984.Lasers & Applications, January 1985 Later, under contract from Fairchild-Weston Systems, Simulaser produced the laser and detector systems for the AGES/ADII (Air-to-Ground Engagement System/Air Defense II) program for the US Army, outfitting a number of helicopters with training systems and producing laser simulators for the HGSS/GVLLD (Hellfire Ground Support System Simulator/Ground-based Vehicle Laser Locator Designator). Simulaser's HGSS/GVLLD Simlator Simulaser's MITS unit Simulaser also produced the early low rate of production run of MITS (Multiple Independent Target System) and in 1989 won a development contract from the US Army for STOM (Shoot-through Obscuration Miles) that utilized long-wavelength lasers instead of semiconductor lasers in order to penetrate battlefield obscurants.\\"Battlefield Training in Impaired Visibility\\", SPIE Vol. 1419, 1991 Late in 1989, Simulaser was awarded a $35 million production contract for standard MILES gear, subsequently increased to $44 millionContract DAAA09-89-C-0752, HQ AMCCOM, 30 August 1989, following which Loral Electro-Optical Systems, Inc., acquired the business of Simulaser from ASEC in October 1989, after which Simulaser ceased to exist.News release, Applied Solar Energy Corp., October 13, 1989. Later versions Versions made after 1986 used a loud tone to signal when a soldier was \\"killed\\". In order to turn off the noise, the soldier had to remove a yellow key from the laser module on his rifle and insert it into the box on his harness. By removing the key from the laser, the weapon could no longer score hits using the MILES system. With some systems the hit soldier is required to lie on his back to stop the noise and signal others that he is \\"dead\\". MILES 2 was released in 1991‚Äì92, and the SAWE (simulated area weapons effects) add-on was first fielded in 1992 using GPS and RF messages so that vehicles and individual soldiers can be killed from a central location due to artillery strikes, or nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons strikes. Implementation in the Summer and Fall of 1992 was at Hohenfels, Germany at the Combat Maneuver Training Center. In 1993, the range at Fort Polk was installed and tested. At the time, there were plans to add SAWE at the NTC at Fort Irwin, although instead this was implemented by using SAWE-like features via the DCI radio network. This was superseded in aircraft by the implementation of the SMODIM or the smart onboard data interface module instrumented in 1998 at all three Combat Training Centers (NTC, JRTC, and JMRC). As of July 2006, the latest version of MILES was MILES XXI, provided by Lockheed Martin. As of July 2008, the latest version of soldier worn MILES in the US is MILES IWS, provided by Cubic Corporation. As of July 2012, the latest version of soldier worn MILES in the US is MILES IWS2, provided by Cubic Corporation. As of 2012 the most current version of fully fielded vehicle platform MILES was the Instrumentable multiple integrated laser engagement system combat vehicle tactical engagement simulation system I-MILES CVTESS). This is provided to the US Army by Saab Defense and Security Training and Simulations. It is manufactured at Saab Training in the company's office in Husqvarna, Sweden. Saab's Main Battle Tank (MBT) Crew Trainer enables the warfighter to perform live precision gunnery and combat training. I-MILES CVTESS is a laser-based training device to be used on Abrams, Bradley, and opposing forces (OPFOR) tanks and fighting vehicles to provide real-time casualty effects. It is an evolutionary approach for replacing older I-MILES CVTESS equipment currently used in force-on-force training exercises with devices that provide better training fidelity for combat vehicle systems. It reinforces crew duties, rewards proper engagement techniques and develop tactical maneuver skills of armor and mechanized infantry combined arms teams up to brigade level. It provides unit commanders an integrated training system in force-on-force and force-on-target training events at homestation training area through instrumented training. The system interfaces with instrumentation systems at maneuver combat training centers (MCTC).

The short story was published in August 1936 in Esquire magazine. It was republished in The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories in 1938, The Snows of Kilimanjaro and Other Stories in 1961, and is included in The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vig√≠a Edition (1987). Plot The story opens with a paragraph about Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, whose western summit is called in Masai the ‚ÄúHouse of God.‚Äù There, we are told, lies the frozen carcass of a leopard near the summit. No one knows why it is there at such altitude. The reader is introduced to Harry, a writer dying of gangrene, and Helen, who is with him on safari in Africa. They are stranded in the camp, because a bearing in their truck's engine burnt out. Harry's situation makes him irritable, and he speaks about his impending death in a matter-of-fact, sarcastic way that upsets Helen. He quarrels with her over minute things, from whether he should drink a whiskey and soda, to whether she should read to him. Helen is obviously concerned for his welfare, but Harry's frustration makes him talk unpleasantly towards her. Harry then begins to ruminate on his life experiences, which have been many and varied, and on the fact that he feels he has never reached his potential as a writer because he has chosen to make his living by marrying wealthy women. In italicized portions of the text that are scattered throughout the story, Hemingway narrates some of Harry's experiences in a stream-of-consciousness style. Harry's first memories consist of traveling around Europe following a battle: hiding a deserter in a cottage, hunting and skiing in the mountains, playing cards during a blizzard, and hearing about a bombing run on a train full of Austrian officers. Harry then falls asleep and wakes in the evening to find Helen returning from a shooting expedition. He meditates on how she really is thoughtful and good to him, and how she is not to blame that his talent as a writer has been destroyed. Helen, he remembers, is a rich widow who lost her husband and a child, was bored by a series of lovers, and eventually \\"acquired\\" Harry because \\"she wanted some one that she respected with her\\"; she loves Harry \\"dearly as a writer, as a man, as a companion and as a proud possession\\", while Harry makes it clear that he does not love her. Harry then recalls how he developed gangrene two weeks earlier: they had been trying to get a picture of some waterbuck, and Harry scratched his right knee on a thorn. He had not applied iodine right away, and the wound got infected; because all other antiseptics ran out, he used a weak carbolic solution that \\"paralyzed the minute blood vessels\\", thus the leg developed gangrene. As Helen returns to drink cocktails with Harry, they make up their quarrel. Harry's second memory sequence then begins. He recalls how he once patronized prostitutes in Constantinople \\"to kill his loneliness\\", pining for the very first woman he fell in love with, with whom he quarreled in Paris and broke up. Harry had a fight with a British soldier over an Armenian prostitute, and then left Constantinople for Anatolia, where, after running from a group of Turkish soldiers, \\"he had seen the things that he could never think of and later still he had seen much worse\\". Then Harry recalls that upon his return to Paris, his then-wife inquired about a letter that was actually from Harry's first love‚Äîa reply to the letter he wrote to that woman (mailed to New York, asking to write to his office in Paris) while being in Constantinople. Helen and Harry eat dinner, and then Harry has another memory‚Äîthis time of how his grandfather's log house burned down. He then relates how he fished in the Black Forest, and how he lived in a poor quarter of Paris and felt a kinship with his poor neighbors. Next, he remembers a ranch and a boy he turned in to the sheriff after the boy protected Harry's horse feed by shooting and killing a thief. Harry ponders: \\"That was one story he had saved to write. He knew at least twenty good stories from out there and he had never written one. Why?\\". Then he felt once again that he'd prefer to be in a different company rather than with Helen, as \\"rich were dull\\". Next, his thoughts wander to beating the fear of death, and the limits of being able to bear pain. He remembers an officer named Williamson who was hit by a bomb, and to whom Harry subsequently fed all his morphine tablets. Harry considers how he does not have to worry about pain in his current condition. As Harry lies on his cot remembering, he feels the overwhelming presence of death and associates it with the hyena that has been spotted running around the edge of the campsite. He is unable to speak. Helen, thinking that Harry has fallen asleep, has him moved into the tent for the night. Harry dreams that it is morning, and that a man called Compton has come with a plane to rescue him. He is lifted onto the plane (which has space only for him and the pilot) and watches the landscape go by beneath him. Suddenly, he sees the snow-covered top of Mt. Kilimanjaro, and knows that is where he is bound. Helen wakes up in the middle of the night to a strange hyena cry, and finds Harry unresponsive on his cot.

Opening narration Plot Maury is a playwright who is desperately behind in his rent. After incessant hounding by his landlord and arguing over their latest play, his partner Harry dies of a heart attack. Harry, in his last moments, hands Maury an ancient relic and explains to Maury that the bearer of this relic grants the individual one wish and one wish only. He continues by telling Maury that he had already used his wish and needs Maury to use his wish to heal him. After pondering for a moment, Maury apologizes to Harry and tells him that the wish should be used for something a whole lot more. Harry dies and Maury wishes he could have the greatest playwright ever as his partner. Maury finds himself dressed in Elizabethan-era clothing, and realizes he has gone back in time. Maury sees a man speaking to himself and recognizes him as William Shakespeare. Realizing he has made a serious miscalculation in his wish, Maury informs Shakespeare that he cannot work with him and that he does not belong there. Before he can think of a way to return to his own time, Maury notices that the relic is now in Shakespeare's possession. Clenching it in his hand in a gesture of thought, William says to Maury, \\"I wish for you to work with me.\\" Suddenly Maury is filled with thoughts of all the plays that William has written. Realizing that his fate has been set, he succumbs and sits at a desk and begins to write Hamlet from memory.

A building project in Wuhan China, with the relationship between the inner load-bearing structure and exterior glass curtain visible A curtain wall system is an outer covering of a building in which the outer walls are non-structural, utilized only to keep the weather out and the occupants in. Since the curtain wall is non-structural, it can be made of lightweight materials, thereby reducing construction costs. When glass is used as the curtain wall, an advantage is that natural light can penetrate deeper within the building. The curtain wall fa√ßade does not carry any structural load from the building other than its own dead load weight. The wall transfers lateral wind loads that are incident upon it to the main building structure through connections at floors or columns of the building. A curtain wall is designed to resist air and water infiltration, absorb sway induced by wind and seismic forces acting on the building, withstand wind loads, and support its own dead load weight forces. Curtain wall systems are typically designed with extruded aluminum framing members, although the first curtain walls were made with steel frames. The aluminum frame is typically infilled with glass, which provides an architecturally pleasing building, as well as benefits such as daylighting. However, the effects of light on visual comfort as well as solar heat gain in a building are more difficult to control when using large amounts of glass infill. Other common infills include: stone veneer, metal panels, louvres, and operable windows or vents. Curtain walls differ from storefront systems in that they are designed to span multiple floors, taking into consideration design requirements such as: thermal expansion and contraction; building sway and movement; water diversion; and thermal efficiency for cost-effective heating, cooling, and lighting in the building. History Glass curtain wall of the Kant-Garage (parking garage), Berlin, 1929/30 Glass curtain wall of the Bauhaus Dessau, 1926 Glass curtain walls visible inside Warszawa Centralna railway station in Poland (1975), architect Arseniusz Romanowicz. Built in 2015, Al R√≠o Tower in Buenos Aires- Argentina, is an example of curtain-wall 16 Cook Street, Liverpool, England, 1866. Extensive use is made of floor-to-ceiling glass, enabling light to penetrate deeper into the building, thus maximizing floor space. Oriel Chambers, Liverpool, England,1864. What appears to be an early curtain wall, part of the Curtea Veche Palace in Bucharest, built in 1716 Buildings have long been constructed with the exterior walls of the building supporting the load of the entire structure. The development and widespread use of structural steel and later reinforced concrete allowed relatively small columns to support large loads; hence, exterior walls of buildings were no longer required for structural support. The exterior walls could be non-load bearing and thus much lighter and more open than the masonry load-bearing walls of the past. This gave way to increased use of glass as an exterior fa√ßade, and the modern-day curtain wall was born. Early prototype versions of curtain walls may have existed in buildings of timber construction before the 19th century, should columns have been used to support the building rather than the walls themselves, particularly when large panels of glass infill were involved. When iron began to be used extensively in buildings in late 18th-century Britain such as at Ditherington Flax Mill, and later when buildings of wrought iron and glass such as The Crystal Palace were built, the building blocks of structural understanding were laid for the development of curtain walls. Oriel Chambers (1864) and 16 Cook Street (1866), both built in Liverpool, England, by local architect and civil engineer Peter Ellis, are characterised by their extensive use of glass in their facades. Towards the courtyards they even boasted metal-framed glass curtain walls, which makes them two of the world's first buildings to include this architectural feature. The extensive glass walls allowed light to penetrate further into the building, utilizing more floor space and reducing lighting costs. Oriel Chambers comprises set over five floors without an elevator, which had only recently been invented and was not yet widespread. An early example of an all-steel curtain wall used in the classical style is the ' department store on ', Berlin, built in 1901 (since demolished). Some of the first curtain walls were made with steel mullions, and the polished plate glass was attached to the mullions with asbestos- or fiberglass-modified glazing compound. Eventually silicone sealants or glazing tape were substituted for the glazing compound. Some designs included an outer cap to hold the glass in place and to protect the integrity of the seals. The first curtain wall installed in New York City, in the United Nations Secretariat Building (Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, 1952), was this type of construction. Earlier modernist examples are the Bauhaus in Dessau (1926) and the Hallidie Building in San Francisco (1918). Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's curtain wall is one of the most important aspect of his architectural design. Mies first began prototyping the curtain wall in his high-rise residential building designs along Chicago's lakeshore, achieving the look of a curtain wall at famed 860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments. He finally perfected the curtain wall at 900 910 Lake Shore Drive, where the curtain is an autonomous alumninum and glass skin. After 900 910, Mies' curtain wall appeared on all of his subsequent high-rise building designs including the famed Seagram building in New York. During the 1970s, the widespread use of aluminium extrusions for mullions began. Aluminum alloys offer the unique advantage of being able to be easily extruded into nearly any shape required for design and aesthetic purposes. Today, the design complexity and shapes available are nearly limitless. Custom shapes can be designed and manufactured with relative ease. The Omni San Diego Hotel curtain wall in California (developed by JMI Realty, designed by architectural firm Hornberger and Worstel, is an example of a unitized curtain-wall system with integrated sunshades.Wausau Press Releases, \\"Omni San Diego Hotel offers breathtaking Bay views through Wausau‚Äôs curtainwall\\", Wausau Press Releases, Retrieved 2 October 2015 Systems and principles =Stick systems= The vast majority of ground-floor curtain walls are installed as long pieces (referred to as sticks) between floors vertically and between vertical members horizontally. Framing members may be fabricated in a shop, but installation and glazing is typically performed at the jobsite. =Ladder systems= Very similar to a stick system, a ladder system has mullions which can be split and then either snapped or screwed together consisting of a half box and plate. This allows sections of curtain wall to be fabricated in a shop, effectively reducing the time spent installing the system on site. The drawbacks of using such a system is reduced structural performance and visible joint lines down the length of each mullion. =Unitized systems= Unitized curtain walls entail factory fabrication and assembly of panels and may include factory glazing. These completed units are installed on the building structure to form the building enclosure. Unitized curtain wall has the advantages of: speed; lower field installation costs; and quality control within an interior climate-controlled environment. The economic benefits are typically realized on large projects or in areas of high field labor rates. =Rainscreen principle= A common feature in curtain wall technology, the rainscreen principle theorizes that equilibrium of air pressure between the outside and inside of the \\"rainscreen\\" prevents water penetration into the building. For example, the glass is captured between an inner and an outer gasket in a space called the glazing rebate. The glazing rebate is ventilated to the exterior so that the pressure on the inner and outer sides of the outer gasket is the same. When the pressure is equal across this gasket, water cannot be drawn through joints or defects in the gasket. Design concerns A curtain wall system must be designed to handle all loads imposed on it as well as keep air and water from penetrating the building envelope. =Loads= The loads imposed on the curtain wall are transferred to the building structure through the anchors which attach the mullions to the building. ;Dead load Dead load is defined as the weight of structural elements and the permanent features on the structure.2006 International Building Code, Section 1602.1 In the case of curtain walls, this load is made up of the weight of the mullions, anchors and other structural components of the curtain wall, as well as the weight of the infill material. Additional dead loads imposed on the curtain wall may include sunshades or signage attached to the curtain wall. ;Wind load Wind load is a normal force acting on the building as the result of wind blowing on the building.\\"Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures,\\" American Society of Civil Engineers, 2005; Chapter 6 Wind pressure is resisted by the curtain wall system since it envelops and protects the building. Wind loads vary greatly throughout the world, with the largest wind loads being near the coast in hurricane-prone regions. For each project location, building codes specify the required design wind loads. Often, a wind tunnel study is performed on large or unusually-shaped buildings. A scale model of the building and the surrounding vicinity is built and placed in a wind tunnel to determine the wind pressures acting on the structure in question. These studies take into account vortex shedding around corners and the effects of surrounding topography and buildings. ;Seismic load Seismic loads in curtain wall system are limited to the interstory drift induced on the building during an earthquake. In most situations, the curtain wall is able to naturally withstand seismic and wind induced building sway because of the space provided between the glazing infill and the mullion. In tests, standard curtain wall systems are typically able to withstand up to three inches (75 mm) of relative floor movement without glass breakage or water leakage. ;Snow load Snow loads and live loads are not typically an issue in curtain walls, since curtain walls are designed to be vertical or slightly inclined. If the slope of a wall exceeds 20 degrees or so, these loads may need to be considered.\\"Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures,\\" American Society of Civil Engineers, 2005; Chapter 7 ;Thermal load Thermal loads are induced in a curtain wall system because aluminum has a relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion. This means that over the span of a couple of floors, the curtain wall will expand and contract some distance, relative to its length and the temperature differential. This expansion and contraction is accounted for by cutting horizontal mullions slightly short and allowing a space between the horizontal and vertical mullions. In unitized curtain wall, a gap is left between units, which is sealed from air and water penetration by gaskets. Vertically, anchors carrying wind load only (not dead load) are slotted to account for movement. Incidentally, this slot also accounts for live load deflection and creep in the floor slabs of the building structure. ;Blast load Accidental explosions and terrorist threats have brought on increased concern for the fragility of a curtain wall system in relation to blast loads. The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has spawned much of the current research and mandates in regards to building response to blast loads. Currently, all new federal buildings in the U.S. and all U.S. embassies built on foreign soil must have some provision for resistance to bomb blasts.\\"Design of Buildings to Resist Progressive Collapse,\\" UFC 4-023-03, U.S. Department of Defense, 2009 Since the curtain wall is at the exterior of the building, it becomes the first line of defense in a bomb attack. As such, blast resistant curtain walls are designed to withstand such forces without compromising the interior of the building to protect its occupants. Since blast loads are very high loads with short durations, the curtain wall response should be analyzed in a dynamic load analysis, with full-scale mock-up testing performed prior to design completion and installation. Blast resistant glazing consists of laminated glass, which is meant to break but not separate from the mullions. Similar technology is used in hurricane-prone areas for impact protection from wind-borne debris. =Air Infiltration= Air infiltration is the air which passes through the curtain wall from the exterior to the interior of the building. The air is infiltrated through the gaskets, through imperfect joinery between the horizontal and vertical mullions, through weep holes, and through imperfect sealing. The American Architectural Manufacturers Association (AAMA) is an industry trade group in the U.S. that has developed voluntary specifications regarding acceptable levels of air infiltration through a curtain wall.Testing is typically conducted by an independent third party agency using the ASTM E-783 standard. =Water penetration= Water penetration is defined as water passing from the exterior of the building to the interior of the curtain wall system. Sometimes, depending on the building specifications, a small amount of controlled water on the interior is deemed acceptable. Controlled water penetration is defined as water that penetrates beyond the inner most vertical plane of the test specimen, but has a designed means of drainage back to the exterior. AAMA Voluntary Specifications allow for controlled water penetration while the underlying ASTM E1105 test method would define such water penetration as a failure. To test the ability of a curtain wall to withstand water penetration in the field, an ASTM E1105 water spray rack system is placed on the exterior side of the test specimen, and a positive air pressure difference is applied to the system. This set up simulates a wind driven rain event on the curtain wall to check for field performance of the product and of the installation. Field quality control and assurance checks for water penetration has become the norm as builders and installers apply such quality programs to help reduce the number of water damage litigation suits against their work. =Deflection= One of the disadvantages of using aluminum for mullions is that its modulus of elasticity is about one-third that of steel. This translates to three times more deflection in an aluminum mullion compared to a similar steel section under a given load. Building specifications set deflection limits for perpendicular (wind-induced) and in-plane (dead load- induced) deflections. These deflection limits are not imposed due to strength capacities of the mullions. Rather, they are designed to limit deflection of the glass (which may break under excessive deflection), and to ensure that the glass does not come out of its pocket in the mullion. Deflection limits are also necessary to control movement at the interior of the curtain wall. Building construction may be such that there is a wall located near the mullion, and excessive deflection can cause the mullion to contact the wall and cause damage. Also, if deflection of a wall is quite noticeable, public perception may raise undue concern that the wall is not strong enough. Deflection limits are typically expressed as the distance between anchor points divided by a constant number. A deflection limit of L/175 is common in curtain wall specifications, based on experience with deflection limits that are unlikely to cause damage to the glass held by the mullion. Say a given curtain wall is anchored at 12 foot (144 in) floor heights. The allowable deflection would then be 144/175 = 0.823 inches, which means the wall is allowed to deflect inward or outward a maximum of 0.823 inches at the maximum wind pressure. However, some panels require stricter movement restrictions, or certainly those that prohibit a torque-like motion. Deflection in mullions is controlled by different shapes and depths of curtain wall members. The depth of a given curtain wall system is usually controlled by the area moment of inertia required to keep deflection limits under the specification. Another way to limit deflections in a given section is to add steel reinforcement to the inside tube of the mullion. Since steel deflects at one-third the rate of aluminum, the steel will resist much of the load at a lower cost or smaller depth. =Strength= Strength (or maximum usable stress) available to a particular material is not related to its material stiffness (the material property governing deflection); it is a separate criterion in curtain wall design and analysis. This often affects the selection of materials and sizes for design of the system. The allowable bending strength for certain aluminum alloys, such as those typically used in curtain wall framing, approaches the allowable bending strength of steel alloys used in building construction. =Thermal criteria= Relative to other building components, aluminum has a high heat transfer coefficient, meaning that aluminum is a very good conductor of heat. This translates into high heat loss through aluminum curtain wall mullions. There are several ways to compensate for this heat loss, the most common way being the addition of thermal breaks. Thermal breaks are barriers between exterior metal and interior metal, usually made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). These breaks provide a significant decrease in the thermal conductivity of the curtain wall. However, since the thermal break interrupts the aluminum mullion, the overall moment of inertia of the mullion is reduced and must be accounted for in the structural analysis and deflection analysis of the system. Thermal conductivity of the curtain wall system is important because of heat loss through the wall, which affects the heating and cooling costs of the building. On a poorly performing curtain wall, condensation may form on the interior of the mullions. This could cause damage to adjacent interior trim and walls. Rigid insulation is provided in spandrel areas to provide a higher R-value at these locations. Infills Infill refers to the large panels that are inserted into the curtain wall between mullions. Infills are typically glass but may be made up of nearly any exterior building element. Some common infills include metal panels, louvers, and photovoltaic panels. =Glass= By far the most common glazing type, glass can be of an almost infinite combination of color, thickness, and opacity. For commercial construction, the two most common thicknesses are 1/4 inch (6 mm) monolithic and 1 inch (25 mm) insulating glass. 1/4 inch glass is typically used only in spandrel areas, while insulating glass is used for the rest of the building (sometimes spandrel glass is specified as insulating glass as well). The 1 inch insulation glass is typically made up of two 1/4-inch lites of glass with a 1/2 inch (12 mm) airspace. The air inside is usually atmospheric air, but some inert gases, such as argon or krypton may be used to offer better thermal transmittance values. Curtain wall architecture building In residential construction, thicknesses commonly used are 1/8 inch (3 mm) monolithic and 5/8 inch (16 mm) insulating glass. Larger thicknesses are typically employed for buildings or areas with higher thermal, relative humidity, or sound transmission requirements, such as laboratory areas or recording studios. Glass may be used which is transparent, translucent, or opaque, or in varying degrees thereof. Transparent glass usually refers to vision glass in a curtain wall. Spandrel or vision glass may also contain translucent glass, which could be for security or aesthetic purposes. Opaque glass is used in areas to hide a column or spandrel beam or shear wall behind the curtain wall. Another method of hiding spandrel areas is through shadow box construction (providing a dark enclosed space behind the transparent or translucent glass). Shadow box construction creates a perception of depth behind the glass that is sometimes desired. =Fabric veneer= Fabric is another type of material which is common for curtain walls. Fabric is often much less expensive and serves as a less permanent solution. Unlike glass or stone, fabric is much faster to install, less expensive, and often much easier to modify after it is installed. Because of low density of fabrics total weight of structure is very low then strength consideration of structure is not too important. =Stone veneer= Thin blocks (3 to 4 inches (75‚Äì100 mm)) of stone can be inset within a curtain wall system. The type of stone used is limited only by the strength of the stone and the ability to manufacture it in the proper shape and size. Common stone types used are: calcium silicate, granite, marble, travertine, and limestone. To reduce weight and improve strength, the natural stone may be attached to an aluminum honeycomb backing. =Panels= Metal panels can take various forms including aluminum plate; aluminum composite panels consisting of two thin aluminum sheets sandwiching a thin plastic interlayer; copper wall cladding, and panels consisting of metal sheets bonded to rigid insulation, with or without an inner metal sheet to create a sandwich panel. Other opaque panel materials include fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP), stainless steel, and terracotta. Terracotta curtain wall panels were first used in Europe, but only a few manufacturers produce high quality modern terracotta curtain wall panels. =Louvers= A louver is provided in an area where mechanical equipment located inside the building requires ventilation or fresh air to operate. They can also serve as a means of allowing outside air to filter into the building to take advantage of favorable climatic conditions and minimize the usage of energy-consuming HVAC systems. Curtain wall systems can be adapted to accept most types of louver systems to maintain the same architectural sightlines and style while providing the functionality. =Windows and vents= Most curtain wall glazing is fixed, meaning there is no access to the exterior of the building except through doors. However, windows or vents can be glazed into the curtain wall system as well, to provide required ventilation or operable windows. Nearly any window type can be made to fit into a curtain wall system. Fire safety Combustible polystyrene insulation in point contact with sheet metal backban. Incomplete firestop in the perimeter slab edge, made of rockwool without topcaulking. Firestopping at the perimeter slab edge, which is a gap between the floor and the curtain wall, is essential to slow the passage of fire and combustion gases between floors. Spandrel areas must have non-combustible insulation at the interior face of the curtain wall. Some building codes require the mullion to be wrapped in heat-retarding insulation near the ceiling to prevent the mullions from melting and spreading the fire to the floor above. The firestop at the perimeter slab edge is considered a continuation of the fire-resistance rating of the floor slab. The curtain wall itself, however, is not ordinarily required to have a rating. This causes a quandary as compartmentalization (fire protection) is typically based upon closed compartments to avoid fire and smoke migrations beyond each engaged compartment. A curtain wall by its very nature prevents the completion of the compartment (or envelope). The use of fire sprinklers has been shown to mitigate this matter. As such, unless the building is sprinklered, fire may still travel up the curtain wall, if the glass on the exposed floor is shattered from heat, causing flames to lick up the outside of the building. Falling glass can endanger pedestrians, firefighters and firehoses below. An example of this is the 1988 First Interstate Tower fire in Los Angeles, California. The fire leapfrogged up the tower by shattering the glass and then consuming the aluminum framing holding the glass. Aluminum's melting temperature is 660 ¬∞C, whereas building fires can reach 1,100 ¬∞C. The melting point of aluminum is typically reached within minutes of the start of a fire. Fireman knock-out glazing panels are often required for venting and emergency access from the exterior. Knock-out panels are generally fully tempered glass to allow full fracturing of the panel into small pieces and relatively safe removal from the opening. Maintenance and repair Curtain walls and perimeter sealants require maintenance to maximize service life. Perimeter sealants, properly designed and installed, have a typical service life of 10 to 15 years. Removal and replacement of perimeter sealants require meticulous surface preparation and proper detailing. Aluminum frames are generally painted or anodized. Care must be taken when cleaning areas around anodized material as some cleaning agents will destroy the finish. Factory applied fluoropolymer thermoset coatings have good resistance to environmental degradation and require only periodic cleaning. Recoating with an air-dry fluoropolymer coating is possible but requires special surface preparation and is not as durable as the baked-on original coating. Anodized aluminum frames cannot be \\"re-anodized\\" in place but can be cleaned and protected by proprietary clear coatings to improve appearance and durability. Stainless steel curtain walls require no coatings, and embossed, as opposed to abrasively finished, surfaces maintain their original appearance indefinitely without cleaning or other maintenance. Some specially textured matte stainless steel surface finishes are hydrophobic and resist airborne and rain-borne pollutants.McGuire, Michael F., \\"Stainless Steel for Design Engineers\\", ASM International, 2008. This has been valuable in the American Southwest and in the Mideast for avoiding dust, as well as avoiding soot and smoke staining in polluted urban areas.

In 1973, two 300-pound metal pieces by Chamberlain were mistaken for junk and carted away as they sat outside a gallery warehouse in Chicago. In the early 1980s, Chamberlain moved to Sarasota, Florida, where an 18,000-square-foot warehouse studio on Cocoanut Avenue enabled him to work on a much grander scale than he previously had. Many of the subsequent works Chamberlain made in Florida revert to more volumetric, compact configurations, often aligned on a vertical axis.

Plot Kevin and Dan are two scientists who create a holographic projector. One day, the device starts generating images of a human fetus. The two watch as the fetus matures into a baby, a young girl, then a full grown woman, growing at a rate of ten years each day. They find out that Nola, as she calls herself, was once a young woman who lived in Westchester County, New York (near Hastings-On- Hudson) during the early twentieth century. They debate over whether or not Nola is a human soul somehow integrated into their hologram generator. Kevin begins to fall in love with this creation. He spends more time at the lab than at home, and his troubled home life deteriorates as a result. Nola talks with Kevin about her father, and how he tried to keep her burgeoning intellect from blossoming. She asks Kevin about his estranged wife, causing him to recall with fondness how they first met. They discuss the poetry of Yeats. Nola relates meeting and falling in love with Robert, a kindred intellectual, which arouses Kevin's jealousy. During the fifth day of studying Nola, she reveals she is pregnant and then relives a miscarriage. Interviewing her acquaintances, Dan later discovers the miscarriage was the cause of Nola's death, and that Robert never forgave himself, dying of grief soon after. As the holographic Nola ages and nears death she uses a voice modifier machine to call Kevin's wife Carol. Posing as Kevin, Nola tells her to come pick him up from the laboratory. In their final conversation, Nola reveals that Kevin is Robert reincarnated, his grief carried \\"into the next\\" life. Nola has finally been able to give him closure by experiencing the life he longed to have with her. He brings out the Yeats book and reads their favorite passage. Nola fades away as Kevin's wife enters the lab, and they have an emotional reunion. Carol is then quite surprised as a child's toy ball bounces out of the holographic chamber and into her hands.

R.\\" Burnett (November 25, 1899 April 25, 1982) was an American novelist and screenwriter. He is best known for the crime novel Little Caesar, the film adaptation of which is considered the first of the classic American gangster movies. Early life Burnett was born in Springfield, Ohio. He left his civil service job there to move to Chicago when he was 28, by which time he had written over 100 short stories and five novels, all unpublished. Writing career In Chicago, Burnett found a job as a night clerk in the seedy Northmere Hotel. He found himself associating with prize fighters, hoodlums, hustlers and hobos. They inspired Little Caesar (novel 1929, film 1931). Little Caesar's overnight success landed him a job as a Hollywood screenwriter. Little Caesar became a classic movie, produced by First National Pictures (Warner Brothers) and starring the unknown Edward G. Robinson. The Al Capone theme was one he returned to in 1932 with Scarface. Burnett had won the 1930 O. Henry Award for his short story \\"Dressing-Up\\" published in Harper's Magazine in November 1929. Burnett kept busy, producing a novel or more a year and turning most into screenplays (some as many as three times). Thematically Burnett was similar to Dashiell Hammett and James M. Cain but his contrasting of the corruption and corrosion of the city with the better life his characters yearned for, represented by the paradise of the pastoral, was fresh and original. He portrayed characters who, for one reason or another, fell into a life of crime. Once sucked into this life they were unable to climb out. They typically get one last shot at salvation but the oppressive system closes in and denies redemption. Burnett's characters exist in a world of twilight morality ‚Äî virtue can come from gangsters and criminals, malice from guardians and protectors. Above all his characters are human and this could be their undoing. In High Sierra (1941), Humphrey Bogart plays Roy Earle, a hard-bitten criminal who rejects his life of crime to help a crippled girl. In The Asphalt Jungle (1949), the most perfectly masterminded plot falls apart as each character reveals a weakness. In The Beast of the City (1932), the police take the law into their own hands when the criminals walk free due to legal incompetence, foreshadowing Dirty Harry by almost 40 years. Film work Burnett worked with many of the greats in acting and directing, including Raoul Walsh, John Huston, John Ford, Howard Hawks, Nicholas Ray, Douglas Sirk, and Michael Cimino, John Wayne (The Dark Command), Humphrey Bogart, Ida Lupino, Paul Muni, Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood. He received an Oscar nomination for his script for Wake Island (1942) and a Writers Guild nomination for his script for The Great Escape. In addition to his film work he also wrote scripts for television and radio. Later years In later years, with his vision declining, he stopped writing and turned to promoting his earlier work. In his career he achieved huge popularity in Europe, where his anti-hero ideology was enthusiastically embraced. On his death in 1982, in Santa Monica, California, Burnett was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

It is similar in function to a splint. Plaster bandages consist of a cotton bandage that has been combined with plaster of paris, which hardens after it has been made wet. Plaster of Paris is calcined gypsum (roasted gypsum), ground to a fine powder by milling. When water is added, the more soluble form of calcium sulfate returns to the relatively insoluble form, and heat is produced. :2 (CaSO4¬∑¬Ω H2O) + 3 H2O ‚Üí 2 (CaSO4.2H2O) + Heat The setting of unmodified plaster starts about 10 minutes after mixing and is complete in about 45 minutes; however, the cast is not fully dry for 72 hours. Current bandages of synthetic materials are often used, often knitted fiberglass bandages impregnated with polyurethane, sometimes bandages of thermoplastic. These are lighter and dry much faster than plaster bandages. However, plaster can be more easily moulded to make a snug and therefore more comfortable fit. In addition, plaster is much smoother and does not snag clothing or abrade the skin. Cast types =Upper extremity= Upper extremity casts encase the arm, wrist, or hand. A long arm cast encases the arm from the hand to about 2 inches below the armpit, leaving fingers and thumbs free. A short arm cast, in contrast, stops just below the elbow. Both varieties may, depending on the injury and the doctor's decision, include one or more fingers or the thumb, in which case it is called a finger spica or thumb spica cast. =Lower extremity= Newly applied short leg cast Short leg walking cast Lower extremity casts are classified similarly, with a cast encasing both the foot and the leg to the hip being called a long leg cast, while a cast encasing the patient's foot, ankle and lower leg ending below the knee is referred to as a short leg cast. A walking heel may be applied for ambulation. These heels, when properly applied, elevate the toes and offer the wearer the advantage of keeping the toes out of the dirt and moisture of the street. The walking heel provides a small contact patch for the cast and creates a fluid rocking motion during the stride as the cast can pivot easily in any direction. Similarly, a weight-bearing cast shoe (cast boot,cast sandal) can help the patient walk during convalescence. Additionally, a castshoe can simply protect the patient's casted foot while helping to maintain better hygiene by preventing the cast from directly contacting potentially dirty or wet ground surfaces. Where the patient is not to walk on the injured limb, crutches or a wheelchair may be provided. The foot's under-sole portion of a leg cast may be extended terminating at the tip of the patient's toes, to create a rigid support that limits motion of the metatarsals in both weight bearing and non-weight bearing leg casts. These are referred to as toeplates in the orthopedic discipline of medicine. This addition may be applied to further support and stabilize the metatarsals by limiting motion through a higher degree of immobilization, as well as protecting the toes from additional blunt force trauma. Typically leg casts with no toeplate are prescribed for injuries to the foot and metatarsals. Ordinarily, a leg cast applied for the treatment of a stable ankle fracture would not use the toeplate design because there is no need to immobilize and limit the motion of the patient's toes. =Cylinder= In some cases, a cast may include the upper and lower arm and the elbow, but leave the wrist and hand free, or the upper and lower leg and the knee, leaving the foot and ankle free. Such a cast may be called a cylinder cast. Where the wrist or ankle is included, it may be called a long arm or long leg cast. =Body= Body casts, which cover the trunk of the body, and in some cases the neck up to or including the head (see Minerva Cast, below) or one or more limbs, are rarely used today, and are most commonly used in the cases of small children, who cannot be trusted to comply with a back brace, or in cases of radical surgery to repair an injury or other defect. A body cast that encases the trunk (with \\"straps\\" over the shoulders) is usually called a body jacket. These are often very uncomfortable. =EDF cast= An EDF (elongation, derotation, flexion) cast is used for the treatment of Infantile Idiopathic scoliosis. This method of treatment for correction was developed by UK scoliosis specialist Min Mehta.Infantile scoliosis outreach program: What is Mehta‚Äôs Growth Guidance Casting? Scoliosis is a 3-dimensional problem that requires correction in all three planes. The EDF casting method can elongate the spine through traction, derotate the spine/pelvis, and improve lordosis and overall body shape and alignment. EDF differs from Risser casting. EDF casts are either over or under the shoulder, and have a large mushroom opening on the front to allow for proper chest expansion. On the back, there is a small cutout on the concavity of the curve, not going past the midline. It was found that the spine became more aligned with this cutout than without, and that it helped correct rotation. =Spica cast= A cast that includes the trunk of the body and one or more limbs is a spica cast, just as is a cast that includes the \\"trunk\\" of the arm and one or more fingers or the thumb. For example, a shoulder spica includes the trunk of the body and one arm, usually to the wrist or hand. Shoulder spicas are almost never seen today, having been replaced with specialized splints and slings that provide early mobility of the injury to avoid joint stiffness after healing. A hip spica includes the trunk of the body and one or more legs. A hip spica that covers only one leg to the ankle or foot is called a single hip spica, while one that covers both legs is a double hip spica. A one-and-a-half hip spica encases one leg to the ankle or foot and the other to just above the knee. The extent to which the hip spica covers the trunk depends greatly on the injury and the surgeon; the spica may extend only to the navel, allowing mobility of the spine and the possibility of walking with the aid of crutches, or may extend to the rib cage or even to the armpits in some rare cases. Hip spicas are common in maintaining reduction of femoral fractures and are also used for congenital hip dislocations, mostly while the child is still an infant. In some cases, a hip spica may only extend down one or more legs to above the knee. Such casts, called pantaloon casts, are occasionally seen to immobilize an injured lumbar spine or pelvis, in which case the trunk portion of the cast usually extends to the armpits. Mobility and hygiene Mobility is severely restricted by the hip spica cast and walking without crutches or a walker is impossible because the hips cannot bend. There is a serious danger of falling if the patient in a hip spica cast tries to get upright to walk without assistance because they lack the ability to control their balance. Patients are normally confined to a bed or reclining wheelchair, or children's stroller. Children in spica casts can sometimes learn to get mobile by scooting around on skateboards, or pulling themselves across the floor. Some children even learn to walk by holding themselves up against furniture. A child in a spica cast must always be supervised and safety must always be considered when they are at a mobile phase of their healing to prevent reinjury or damage to the cast. Many spica casts have a spreader bar between the legs to help strengthen the cast and support the legs in the proper positions. It is important when moving the casted patient to not lift them by this spreader bar, as it may break and this could cause injury to the patient. To facilitate toileting or diaper changing and hygienic cleaning, an opening is created in the cast at the groin. The opening is normally referred to as the \\"perineal opening\\". It is formed either during cast application or after cast application by cutting the hole with the cast saw. The opening must then be petalled or lined to keep this area of the cast clean and dry. Because the hips cannot bend, using a toilet is difficult, if not impossible. It is therefore necessary for the patient to either use a diaper, bedpan, or catheters to manage bodily waste eliminations. Bathing must be done by sponge baths. Hair may be shampooed by using plastic wash basins under the head. To shampoo wash the hair of a child, the child can be lifted and placed on a kitchen counter top and their head held over the kitchen sink. =Other casts= Other body casts which were used in decades past to protect an injured spine or as part of the treatment for a spinal deformity (see scoliosis) which are rarely seen today include the Minerva cast and Risser cast. The Minerva cast includes the trunk of the body (sometimes extending down only so far as the rib cage) as well as the patient's head, with openings provided for the patient's face, ears, and usually the top of the head and hair. The Risser cast was similar, extending from the patient's hips to the neck and sometimes including part of the head. Both of these casts could, with care and the doctor's permission, be walked in during convalescence. However, in some cases the Risser cast would extend into one or more pantaloons, in which case mobility was far more restricted. Aside from the above common forms, body casts could come in nearly any size and configuration. For example, from the 1910s to the 1970s, use of a turnbuckle cast, which used metal turnbuckles to twist two halves of the cast so as to forcibly straighten the spine before surgery, was common. The turnbuckle cast had no single configuration, and could be as small as a body jacket split in half, or could include the head, one or both legs to the knees or feet, and/or one arm to the elbow or wrist depending on the choice of the doctor. Despite the large size and extreme immobilization some casts, particularly those used in or before the 1970s, the popular term full body cast is something of a misnomer. The popular and media-driven conception of a massive cast encasing all four limbs, the trunk, and the head ‚Äì sometimes leaving only small slits for the eyes, nose, and mouth ‚Äì is a true rarity in recorded medical history, and this type of large scale cast appears more commonly in various Hollywood movies and on television shows. The term body cast (or full body cast) is sometimes casually used by laymen to describe any of a number of body and/or spica casts, from a simple body jacket to a more extensive hip spica. Materials fibreglass and polyurethane casting material, 4ply Cotton and plaster casting material, (plaster cast) 4ply. Due to the nature of the dressing in that the limb is unreachable during treatment; the skin under the plaster becomes dry and scaly because the discarded outer skin cells are not washed or brushed off. Also, plaster of Paris casts can result in cutaneous complications including macerations, ulcerations, infections, rashes, itching, burns, and allergic contact dermatitis, which may also be due to the presence of formaldehyde within the plaster bandages. In hot weather, staphylococcal infection of the hair follicles and sweat glands can lead to severe and painful dermatitis. Other limitations of plaster casts include their weight, which can be quite considerable, thus restricting movement, especially of a child. Removal of the cast requires destroying the cast itself. The process is often noisy, making use of a special oscillating saw that can easily cut the hard cast material but has difficulty cutting soft material like cast padding or skin. Although the removal is often painless, this can be distressing for the patient, especially children. A cast saw can cut, abrade, or burn skin, but those results are uncommon. Additionally, plaster of Paris casts break down if patients get them wet. Due to the limitations of plaster of Paris, surgeons have also experimented with other types of materials for use as splints. An early plastic like material was gutta-percha obtained from the latex of trees found in Malaya. It resembled rubber, but contained more resins. When dry it was hard and inelastic, but when warmed it became soft and malleable. In 1851 Utterhoeven, described the use of splints made from this material for the treatment of fractures. In the 1970s, the development of fibreglass casting tape made it possible to produce a cast that was lighter and more durable than the traditional plaster cast and also resistant to water (though the bandages underneath were not) helping the patient be more active. In the 1990s the introduction of new cast lining has meant that fiberglass casts with this liner are completely waterproof, allowing patients to bathe, shower, and swim while wearing a cast. The waterproof cast liner however adds approximately 2 to 3 more minutes to the application time of the cast and increases the cost of the cast. Drying time, however, can be inconvenient enough to warrant a cast and bandage moisture protector. These waterproof covers allow for bathing and showering while wearing either a plaster or fiberglass cast. The waterproof cast cover stays tightly around the cast and prevents water from ever reaching it while the patient is in contact with water. The cover can easily be removed to dry, and can be re-used often. = Cast liner = Cast liners are often cotton. Though waterproof lining material is also available. Removal An orange short arm cast with a fiberglass top layer being cut and removed with a specialized cast saw. Casts are typically removed by perforation using a cast saw, an oscillating saw designed to cut rigid material such as plaster or fiberglass while not harming soft tissue. Manually operated shears, patented in 1950 by Neil McKay, may be used on pediatric or other patients which may be affected by the noise of the saw. History Hippocrates: a conventionalized image in a Roman \\"portrait\\" bust (19th-century engraving)The earliest methods of holding a reduced fracture involved using splints. These are rigid strips laid parallel to each other alongside the bone. The Ancient Egyptians used wooden splints made of bark wrapped in linen. They also used stiff bandages for support that were probably derived from embalming techniques. The use of plaster of Paris to cover walls is evident, but it seems it was never used for bandages. Ancient Hindus treated fractures with bamboo splints, and the writings of Hippocrates discuss management of fractures in some detail, recommending wooden splints plus exercise to prevent muscle atrophy during the immobilization. The ancient Greeks also used waxes and resins to create stiffened bandages and the Roman Celsus, writing in AD 30, describes how to use splints and bandages stiffened with starch. Arabian doctors used lime derived from sea shells and albumen from egg whites to stiffen bandages. The Italian School of Salerno in the twelfth century recommended bandages hardened with a flour and egg mixture as did Medieval European bonesetters, who used casts made of egg white, flour, and animal fat. By the sixteenth century the famous French surgeon Ambroise Par√© (1517‚Äì1590), who championed more humane treatments in medicine and promoted the use of artificial limbs, made casts of wax, cardboard, cloth, and parchment that hardened as they dried. These methods all had merit, but the standard method for the healing of fractures was bed rest and restriction of activity. The search for a simpler, less-time consuming, method led to the development of the first modern occlusive dressings, stiffened at first with starch and later with plaster-of-paris. The ambulatory treatment of fractures was the direct result of these innovations. The innovation of the modern cast can be traced to, among others, four military surgeons, Dominique Jean Larrey, Louis Seutin, Antonius Mathijsen, and Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov. Dominique Jean Larrey (1768‚Äì1842) was born in a small town in southern France. He first studied medicine with his uncle, a surgeon in Toulouse. After a short tour of duty as a naval surgeon, he returned to Paris, where he became caught up in the turmoil of the Revolution, being present at the Storming of the Bastille. From then on, he made his career as a surgeon in France's revolutionary and Napoleonic armies, which he accompanied throughout Europe and the Middle East. As a result, Larrey accumulated a vast experience of military medicine and surgery. One of his patients after the Battle of Borodino in 1812 was an infantry officer whose arm was amputated at the shoulder. The patient was evacuated immediately following the operation and passed from Russia, through Poland and Germany. When the dressing was removed on his arrival home in France, the wound had healed. Larrey concluded that the fact that the wound had been undisturbed had facilitated healing. After the war, Larrey began stiffening bandages using camphorated alcohol, lead acetate and egg whites beaten in water. An improved method was introduced by Louis Seutin, (1793‚Äì1865) of Brussels. In 1815 Seutin had served in the allied armies in the war against Napoleon and was on the field of Waterloo. At the time of the development of his bandage he was chief surgeon in the Belgium army. Seutin's \\"bandage amidonnee\\" consisted of cardboard splints and bandages soaked in a solution of starch and applied wet. These dressings required 2 to 3 days to dry, depending on the temperature and humidity of the surroundings. The substitution of Dextrin for starch, advocated by Velpeau, the man widely regarded as the leading French surgeon at the beginning of the 19th century, reduced the drying time to 6 hours. Although this was a vast improvement, it was still a long time, especially in the harsh environment of the battlefield. A good description of Seutin's technique was provided by Sampson Gamgee who learned it from Seutin in France during the winter of 1851‚Äì52 and went on to promote its use in Britain. The limb was initially wrapped in wool, especially over any bony prominences. Pasteboard was then cut into shape to provide a splint, and dampened so it could be molded to the limb. The limb was then wrapped in bandages before a starch coating was applied to the outer surface. Seutin's technique for the application of the starch apparatus formed the basis of the technique used with plaster of Paris dressings today. The use of this method led to the early mobilization of patients with fractures and a marked reduction in hospital time required. =Plaster casts= Gypsum from New South Wales, AustraliaAlthough these bandages were an improvement over Larrey's method, they were far from ideal. They required a long time to apply and dry and there was often shrinkage and distortion. A great deal of interest had been aroused in Europe around 1800 by a British diplomat, consul William Eton, who described a method of treating fractures that he had observed in Turkey. He noted that gypsum plaster (plaster of Paris) was moulded around the patient's leg to cause immobilization. If the cast became loose due to atrophy or a reduction in swelling, then additional gypsum plaster was added to fill the space. Adapting the use of plaster of Paris for use in hospitals, however, took some time. In 1828, doctors in Berlin were treating leg fractures by aligning the bones in a long narrow box, which they filled with moist sand. Substitution of plaster of Paris for the sand was the next logical step. Such plaster casts did not succeed however as the patient was confined to bed due to the casts being heavy and cumbersome. A box of plaster of Paris bandages, 1960 Plaster of Paris bandages were introduced in different forms by 2 army surgeons, one at a peacetime home station and another on active service at the front. Antonius Mathijsen (1805‚Äì1878) was born in Budel, the Netherlands, where his father was the village doctor. He was educated in Brussels, Maastricht and Utrecht obtaining the degree of doctor of medicine at Gissen in 1837. He spent his entire career as a medical officer in the Dutch Army. While he was stationed at Haarlem in 1851, he developed a method of applying plaster of Paris bandages. A brief note describing his method was published on January 30, 1852; it was followed shortly by more complete accounts. In these accounts Mathijsen emphasised that only simple materials were required and the bandage could be quickly applied without assistance. The bandages hardened rapidly, provided an exact fit and could be windowed or bivalved (cut to provide strain relief) easily. Mathijsen used coarsely woven materials, usually linen, into which dry plaster of Paris had been rubbed thoroughly. The bandages were then moistened with a wet sponge or brush as they were applied and rubbed by hand until they hardened. Plaster of Paris dressings were first employed in the treatment of mass casualties in the 1850s during the Crimean War by Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov (1810‚Äì1881). Pirogov was born in Moscow and received his early education there. After obtaining a medical degree at Dorpat he studied at Berlin and G√∂ttingen before returning to Dorpat as a professor of Surgery. In 1840, he became the professor of surgery at the Academy of military medicine in St. Petersburg. Pirogov introduced the use of ether anaesthesia into Russia and made important contributions to the study of cross-sectional human anatomy. With the help of his patron, the grand duchess Helene Pavlovna, he introduced female nurses into the military hospitals at the same time that Florence Nightingale was beginning a similar program in British military hospitals. Seutin had travelled through Russia demonstrating his 'starched bandage', and his technique had been adopted by both the Russian army and navy by 1837. Pirogov had observed the use of plaster of Paris bandages in the studio of a sculptor who used strips of linen soaked in liquid plaster of Paris for making models (this technique, called \\"modroc,\\" is still popular). Pirogov went on to develop his own methods, although he was aware of Mathijsen's work. Pirogov's method involved soaking coarse cloth in a plaster of Paris mixture immediately before application to the limbs, which were protected either by stockings or cotton pads. Large dressings were reinforced with pieces of wood. A plaster-impregnated bandage c. 2005, still in its packaging. As time passed and the method moved more into the mainstream some disagreement arose as to the problems associated with cutting off air to skin contact, and also some improvements were made. Eventually Pirogov's method gave way to Mathijsen's. Among the improvements suggested as early as 1860 was that of making the dressing resistant to water by painting the dried plaster of Paris with a mixture of shellac dissolved in alcohol. The first commercial bandages were not produced until 1931 in Germany, and were called Cellona. Before that the bandages were made by hand at the hospitals. As a plaster cast is applied, it expands by approximately ¬Ω %. The less water is used, the more linear expansion occurs. Potassium sulfate can be used as an accelerator and sodium borate as a retarder to control setting time. See also #Buddy wrapping #H.

It lies in the former French province of Languedoc. Castres is (after Toulouse, Tarbes and Albi) the fourth-largest industrial centre of the predominantly rural Midi-Pyr√©n√©es r√©gion and the largest in that part of Languedoc lying between Toulouse and Montpellier. Castres is noted for being the birthplace of the famous socialist leader Jean Jaur√®s and home to the important Goya Museum of Spanish painting.Goya Museum , Les amis des Mus√©es de Castres. Demography In 1831, the population of Castres was 12,032, making it the largest town of the department of Tarn. One of the few industrial towns in the region of Albigeois, the population of the commune proper grew to 19,483 in 1901, and 34,126 by 1954 (44,161 inhabitants in the metropolitan area). However, with the decline of its industries, population growth diminished. Albi surpassed Castres as the most populous metropolitan area of Tarn. The population of Castres is now stagnating: After slow growth in the 1970s and 1980s, it registered zero growth in the 1990s. Geography Castres is located at an altitude of above sea level. It is located south-southeast of Albi, the pr√©fecture (capital) of Tarn, and east of Toulouse, the capital of Midi-Pyr√©n√©es. Castres is intersected from north to south by the Agout and Durenque rivers. The Thor√© forms most of the commune's south-eastern border, then flows into the Agout, which forms part of its western border. Administration Between 1790 and 1797 Castres was the prefecture of Tarn. Since 2001, the mayor of Castres has been Pascal Bugis (right, member of UMP), who defeated the then socialist mayor in the 2001 election after a campaign focused on the bad records of the socialist mayor on fighting crime, and the high level of insecurity in the town. Castres has teamed up with the nearby town of Mazamet ( southeast of Castres) and the independent suburbs and villages in between to create the Greater Castres-Mazamet Council (Communaut√© d'agglom√©ration de Castres-Mazamet), which was established in January 2000 (succeeding a previous district which had been created in 1993 with fewer powers than the current council). The Greater Castres-Mazamet Council groups 16 independent communes (including Castres and Mazamet), with a total population of 79,988 inhabitants (at the 1999 census), 54% of these living in the commune of Castres proper, 13% in the commune of Mazamet, and the rest in the communes in between. The Greater Castres-Mazamet Council was created in order to better coordinate transport, infrastructure, housing, and economic policies between the communes of the area. The current president of the Greater Castres-Mazamet Council is Jacques Limouzy (Gaullist, member of UMP), former mayor of Castres before 1995, who became president in 2001. History Map showing Castres and the surrounding region, 1638. The name of the town comes from Latin castrum, and means \\"fortified place\\". Castres grew up round the Benedictine abbey of Saint Beno√Æt, which is believed to have been founded in AD 647, possibly on the site of an old Roman fort (castrum). Castres became an important stop on the international pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela in Spain because its abbey-church, built in the 9th century, was keeping the relics of Saint Vincent, the renowned martyr of Spain. It was a place of some importance as early as the 12th century, and ranked as the second town of the Albigeois behind Albi. Despite the decline of its abbey, which in 1074 came under the authority of Saint Victor abbey in Marseille, Castres was granted a liberal charter in the 12th century by the famous Trencavel family, viscounts of Albi. Resulting from the charter, Castres was ruled by a college of consuls. During the Albigensian Crusade it surrendered of its own accord to Simon de Montfort, and thus entered into the kingdom of France in 1229. In 1317, Pope John XXII established the bishopric of Castres. In 1356, the town of Castres was raised to a countship by King John II of France. However, the town greatly suffered from the Black Plague in 1347-1348, then from the Black Prince of England and the Free Companies (bands of lawless mercenaries) who laid waste the country during the Hundred Years' War. Consequently, by the late 14th century Castres entered a period of sharp decline. In 1375, there were only 4,000 inhabitants left in town, only half the figure from a century before. Following the confiscation of the possessions of Jacques d'Armagnac, duke of Nemours, to which the countship of Castres had passed, it was bestowed in 1476 by King Louis XI on Boffille de Juge (Boffillo del Giudice), an Italian nobleman and adventurer serving as a diplomat for Louis XI, but the appointment led to so much disagreement (family feud between Boffille de Juge, his only daughter, and his brother-in-law) that the countship was united to the crown by King Francis I in 1519. Around 1560, the majority of the population of Castres converted to Protestantism. In the wars of the latter part of the 16th century the inhabitants sided with the Protestant party, fortified the town, and established an independent republic. Castres was one of the largest Protestant strongholds in southern France, along with Montauban and La Rochelle. Henry of Navarre, leader of the Protestant party, who later became King Henry IV of France, stayed in Castres in 1585. The Protestants of Castres were brought to terms, however, by King Louis XIII in 1629, and Richelieu came himself to Castres to have its fortifications dismantled. Nonetheless, after these religious wars, the town, now in peace, enjoyed a period of rapid expansion. Business and traditional commercial activities revived, in particular fur and leather-dressing, tanning, and above all wool trade. Culture flourished anew, with the founding of the Academy of Castres in 1648. Castres was turned by the Catholic Church into an active center of Counter-Reformation, with the establishments of several convents in town, and the building of a renowned bishop's palace by Mgr. Tub≈ìuf, still the most famous monument in town today. A new cathedral was also built, after the destructions of the religious wars. Perhaps even more important, Castres was made the seat of the Chambre de l'√âdit of the Parliament of Toulouse, a court of justice detached from the Parliament of Toulouse and in charge of dealing with the cases involving the Protestants of Languedoc, a measure of protection granted to them by the Edict of Nantes. This court attracted much business to Castres. In 1665, there were 7,000 inhabitants in Castres, 4,000 of whom Catholic, and 3,000 Protestant. In 1670 however, the Chambre de l'√âdit was transferred to Castelnaudary, much to the discontent of even the catholic citizens of Castres, who lost a major source of business and revenue with the departure of the lawyers and the plaintiffs. The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes soon followed, and Castres suffered greatly when many Protestants chose to go into exile. Then came the plague of 1720-1721 and the fire of 1724. Last but not least, Castres lost its liberal charter in 1758. In the 1760s, a few years after the famous Calas Affair in Toulouse, Castres made the headlines nationwide: Pierre-Paul Sirven and his wife, both Protestants, were wrongly accused of having murdered their daughter in order to prevent her from converting to Catholicism. Tried and sentenced to death in absentia on March 29, 1764, they were defended by Voltaire, and eventually exonerated in 1771. The outbreak of the French Revolution was generally welcomed in Castres, particularly among the local Protestant merchants and entrepreneurs, but the majority of the population remained moderate during the whole period. In 1793 for instance, Protestant pastor Alba La Source, Castres' representative at the Convention in Paris, opposed the deportation of \\"non-juror\\" Catholic priests to French Guiana, where death in the horrid jungle was certain (see Civil Constitution of the Clergy). \\"Non- juror\\" priests were by far the majority in the region of Castres. Accused of being a moderate, Alba La Source was guillotined in October 1793. Suspected of being lukewarm toward the revolution, Castres was duly chastised. The bishopric which had been established by Pope John XXII in 1317 was abolished, Castres later becoming part of the bishopric of Albi. Capital of the ' of Tarn in 1790, the town was downgraded to capital of an arrondissement in 1797, Albi being made the capital of the '. Despite these setbacks, in the 19th century the economy of Castres developed greatly, and the town grew outside of its old medieval center. As early as 1815, the first mechanized wool mill was set up in town. Originally specialized in luxury cloth, the Castres textile industry then turned toward more ordinary types of cloth, whose markets were considerably larger. Around 1860, there were 50 wool mills in town, employing 3,000 people. In the end of the 19th century, mechanical engineering industries appeared beside the textile industry, which led to Castres becoming a major arsenal for the French army during the First World War. Castres was linked to the French railway network in 1865. At the end of the 19th century, Castres was the largest town in the ' of Tarn, with 5,000 more inhabitants than Albi. However, in the 20th century the town entered a new period of decline. Although Castres emerged from the two world wars unscathed, no military operations or combats taking place in southwest France, the local economy has been hard hit by change. Like so many towns and cities of Europe which had benefited most from the Industrial Revolution, Castres is experiencing a difficult restructuring of its industrial base. Textile has particularly suffered. Castres is also crippled by its geographical location, isolated in a dead end at the foot of the Massif Central mountains, away from the main exchange and transport routes. Castres is still not connected to the motorway (freeway) network of France, the only town of that size in France not yet connected. The creation of the Greater Castres-Mazamet Council in 2000 was expected to deal with the transport problem, and to work on attracting new industries. The good fortune of Castres is to be located only away from the very dynamic Toulouse. The long-promised motorway link with Toulouse is due to be completed soon, and Castres hopes to benefit from its proximity with the big Occitan city. Economy The principal industries are mechanical and electrical engineering, machine tools, wooden furniture, granite, textile, fur and leather-dressing, tanning, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and selective breeding of cows. Traditional and polluting industries such as textile, tanning, fur and leather-dressing, or chemicals, are in sharp decline. However, a multinational pharmaceutical group (Pierre Fabre Group) emerged in the town in the 1960s, and it has kept its headquarters and R&D; division in the metropolitan area, helping to counterbalance the general decline in industry. Some now accuse its founder and president, Pierre Fabre, of being the real \\"master\\" of Castres, making and designating Castres' mayors at will. Despite this isolated success, local industry is still undergoing painful restructuring at the moment. =Transport= The Gare de Castres railway station is served by regional trains to Mazamet and Toulouse. People Castres is the hometown of socialist politician and newspaper publisher Jean Jaur√®s (1859‚Äì1914), who was murdered in Paris the day before the start of the First World War. Mathematician Pierre de Fermat died in Castres in 1665, while attending a session of the Chambre de l'√âdit there. French writer Roger Peyrefitte was born into a wealthy family of Castres in 1907.

The river is fringed by old houses the upper stories of which project over its waters. Cathedral of Saint Beno√Æt in Castres The church of Saint Beno√Æt, once the cathedral of Castres, and the most important of the churches of Castres today, dates only from the 17th and 18th centuries. The city hall occupies the former bishop's palace, designed in the 17th century by Jules Hardouin-Mansart (the architect of Versailles), and with gardens designed by Andr√© Le N√¥tre (the designer of the gardens in Versailles). The Romanesque tower beside it (Tour Saint Beno√Æt) is the only survival of the old Benedictine abbey. The town possesses some old mansions from the 16th and 17th century, including the H√¥tel de Nayrac, of the Renaissance. Castres possesses the renowned Goya Museum, created in 1840, which contains the largest collection of Spanish paintings in France. A Jaur√®s Museum was also opened in 1954 in the house where Jean Jaur√®s was born in 1859. The Jardin botanique Pierre Fabre \\"La Michonne\\" is a private botanical garden and conservatory that can be visited. Sports As one might expect of a town of western Occitania nicknamed Ovalie, the main sport in Castres is rugby union, followed religiously by many locals. The local professional club is Castres Olympique, who are five-time champions of France as well as the current champions (in 1949, 1950, 1993, 2013 and 2018). Castres Olympique is the property of local tycoon Pierre Fabre, founder and president of Pierre Fabre Group. The finish of Stage 12 of the 2007 Tour de France was in Castres.

It began as a one-act play which was first produced on 12 February 1962 at the Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury, England. The Bedsitting Room when was then adapted to a longer play and Bernard Miles put it on at the Mermaid Theatre, where it was first performed on 31 January 1963 before transferring several weeks later to the Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End. The production included a coup de th√©√¢tre, when the character \\"Mate\\" (originally played in London by Spike Milligan) entered wearing a mixture of ragged military uniforms from across the centuries. Attached to his boots were long strips of canvas to which were attached pairs of boots. As he marched across the stage, the empty boots marched in perfect time behind him. It has been commended as both hilarious and heartbreaking. pp.200, 203-204 pp.157-158 The play was then considered a critical and commercial hit, and was revived in 1967 with a provincial tour, before opening at London's Saville Theatre on 3 May 1967.Scudamore (1985) pp.242-244 The script was later published in paperback book.Milligan, Spike, & Antrobus, John (1973) The Bedsitting Room. Tandem: London. First published in Great Britain by Margaret & Jack Hobbs, 1970. Published by Universal-Tandem, 1972. (C) 1970 Spike Milligan and John Antrobus The play was presented in repertory by the Theatre Royal, York in 1972, and was also shown by Bench Theatre in Havant for seven nights in July 1981.Bench Theatre: The Bedsitting Room Linked 2017-02-12 The play is set in a post- apocalyptic London, nine months after World War III (the \\"Nuclear Misunderstanding\\"), which lasted for two minutes and twenty-eight seconds ‚Äì \\"including the signing of the peace treaty\\". Nuclear fallout is producing strange mutations in people; the title refers to the character Lord Fortnum, who finds himself transforming into a bed-sitting room (other characters turn into a parrot and a wardrobe). The plot concerns the fate of the first child to be born after the war. A film based on the play was released in 1969. The film was directed by Richard Lester and the cast included Ralph Richardson, Arthur Lowe, Rita Tushingham, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Michael Hordern, Marty Feldman, Harry Secombe and Milligan himself.  Authors' intentions  In his 2002 book of reflections, Antrobus describes his idea as about \\"a man who fears he will turn into a bedsitting room, which he does, and the dubious doctor he has been seeing moves in with his fianc√©e, declaring that it will be easier to work a cure on the premises. Therein lies the dilemma. For the doctor to heal the condition would mean becoming homeless\\". pp.69-70 In a 1988 interview with Bernard Braden on ITV's All Our Yesterdays, Milligan portrayed his view of The Bedsitting Room thus:  Original cast list for play  The following is the original cast list as it appears on page 5 of the 1973 paperback of the script, with music played by The Temperance Seven *Captain Pontius Kak, Graham Stark. This is Lord Fortnum's doctor, whose name appears to have later changed to Captain Martin.

Opening narration Plot Aboard an airplane, obnoxious teenager Keith Barnes is annoying those around him with his radio. A lightning storm, however, transforms his Walkman into a telepathic tuning device. He begins to hear the voices of all the people around him in the plane, and then he finds out that Mr. Williams, the man sitting next to him, is carrying a bomb. It turns out that Mr. Williams is distraught over the death of his wife and child in a similar airplane, due to the negligence of an indifferent airline. As revenge and as a way of teaching the airline how to be more careful, he intends to destroy the plane with a bomb. Keith, knowing his plan after reading his mind, tries to talk him out of it. Mr. Williams cannot understand how Keith knows his plot but is still determined to detonate the bomb on the airplane. Mr. Williams tries to put his plan into effect, frightening the passengers. Keith manages to sneak up behind him and put the headphones over his ears. Hearing the pleading thoughts of the other passengers, especially those of a young man who has a daughter about the age of Mr. Williams' child, he is immediately filled with remorse and he relents. As Mr. Williams is taken away, however, he accidentally steps on Keith's radio and crushes it.

According to the 2010 census, the population of the district is 33,886, of whom 9,091 live in the town of Haymana.Statistical Institute The district covers an area of , and the average elevation is 1259 m. Etymology According to the 1074-dated dictionary Dƒ´wƒÅn ul-Lughat al-Turk, haymana means prairie in Turkish.http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/diger/278074/Ankara_nin_ilce_isimleri.html History Archaeological excavations were launched in Gavur Kalesi, a castle situated in the village of Derek√∂y, in the years 1930 and 1998. The results showed that it was an important Phrygian settlement. Besides, the tumuli located in T√ºrkh√∂y√ºk and Oyaca villages prove that the area was also inhabited during the Hittite period. After the periods of the Roman and Byzantine rule, the area was captured by the Seljuk Turks in 1127. After the Battle of K√∂se Daƒü it came under Ilkhanate control for a while. In the mid 14th century the area was annexed by the Ottomans. After a brief period of Timurid rule in the wake of the Battle of Ankara in 1402, it was re-captured by the Ottomans.  Demographics  Haymana has a mixed population. A majority of the 78 settlements have a Kurdish population, while the remainder is inhabited by Turkish people who have roots from Iranian Turkmens and Crimean Tatars. Its population peaked in 1985 with 60,823 people. Haymana is largely affected by emigration (mostly to cities like Ankara, Polatlƒ±, G√∂lba≈üƒ± and to a lesser extend Istanbul), because of a high unemployment rate. During the summertime the population of Haymana doubles. There is also a well-established community of people from Haymana in Western Europe, especially Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Denmark and Austria. = Age structure = The district of Haymana has a relatively young population but it is ageing very quickly.

Their first published series, it was their flagship title until its September 2000 cancellation. The second incarnation was published on MySpace, running from July 2007 until August 2010. A third incarnation began in April 2011, released in print form once again. Publishing history =First Incarnation: Volume 1= Dark Horse Presents was conceived as an anthology title and was the first comic to be released by the newly formed Dark Horse Comics in 1986. The first issue featured Black Cross on the cover and featured the first appearance of Paul Chadwick's Concrete. The title became successful thanks to the increasing popularity of Concrete which quickly became the regular cover feature for much of the first few years of the title. Concrete eventually spun off into its own title, and this was something which would happen to several characters and stories appearing in Dark Horse Presents. These included John Byrne's \\"Next Men\\" comic book, as well as Frank Miller's Sin City stories, with the very first \\"Sin City\\" story (later retitled \\"The Hard Goodbye\\") being serialized within the pages of the comic. The title also contained stories featuring Dark Horse's licensed comics, Aliens and Predator, as well as a Buffy the Vampire Slayer story. Dark Horse Presents was Dark Horse's longest running title, and provided a mix of material from established and new creators. The title ended with issue #157 in September 2000. =Second Incarnation: MDHP= Dark Horse Presents was revived online through the social networking website MySpace. The first issue of MDHP featured new talents as well as well-known writers like Joss Whedon and Ron Marz. MDHP ran from August 2007 to July 2010, a total of thirty-six issues which were collected in six trade paperbacks. =Third Incarnation: Volume 2= Dark Horse Presents returned as an eighty-page anthology comic on April 20, 2011 with all-new stories including a Concrete story by Paul Chadwick, a Mr. Monster story by Michael T. Gilbert, a Crimson Empire story from the Star Wars universe, a new strip called Marked Man by Howard Chaykin, a strip called Blood by Neal Adams (his first work for Dark Horse), and a sneak peek of Frank Miller‚Äôs prequel to 300, Xerxes. Two covers were available for the first issue, one featuring Concrete and the other featuring Xerxes. The new DHP has seen the revival of a number of older Dark Horse properties, including Ghost (leading to the launch of a new monthly title) and Ron Randall's Trekker. Dark Horse's May 2014 solicitations for the 36th issue announced \\"...Living legends Mike Mignola, Stan Sakai, and Jaime Hernandez all contribute to this final issue of Dark Horse Presents,\\" although the following day Bleeding Cool reported this was merely the end of the comic in the eighty-page format, and it would return with fewer pages at a later date. =Fourth Incarnation: Volume 3= Beginning August 2014, Dark Horse Presents returned as a forty- eight-page book. According to Dark Horse's Mike Richardson, \\"The main reason is that for three and a half years we've been producing eighty pages a month ‚Äì that's about ten different features ‚Äì and it's time to make it a little easier on ourselves.\\" References External links  * Category:1986 comics debuts Category:Comics anthologies Category:Eisner Award winners for Best Anthology ","title":"Dark Horse Presents"},{"id":"894287","text":"Frederick Leslie Roy Dalgarno (2 December 1910 ‚Äì 1 February 2001) was an Australian social realist artist. Early life, education and training Born in Melbourne, Victoria (Australia) in 1910, Dalgarno was educated at Ballarat Grammar School. From 1926 to 1930 he attended National Gallery Art School in Melbourne, where he met social realists Noel Counihan and Herbert McClintock. He then attended the Academy of Art under Dattilo Rubbo from 1930 to 1932. From 1932 to 1934 he attended East Sydney Technical College Painting & Drawing. Later, between 1951 and 1953 he was at Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, including in 1951-52 William Hayter‚Äôs Atelier 17 (etching). In 1980 he studied etching and collography at the Pratt Graphic Centre, New York. Career He joined the Communist Party of Australia in the 1930s but, according to art historian Bernard Smith, his bohemian temperament was incompatible with party puritanism. He left the party in 1949. In the late 1930s he travelled to the canefields of North Queensland, where he concentrated on his painting. He co- founded the Studio of Realist Art (SORA) Sydney in 1946. From 1947 to 1949 he worked as lecturer at the East Sydney Technical College. After studying in Paris, he moved to India, where he co-founded Editions Anarkali, publisher of fine arts in Bombay, while being employed as a visiting lecturer in lithography at the School of Fine Arts. In 1953 he won the First Prize for Diploma Students, lithography, at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Paris. In 1965 he won first prize at the Mahasartra State (India) exhibition. In 1975 he moved to Auckland, New Zealand, where he worked as a Lecturer in drawing and composition at the Auckland Society of Arts. Death Dalgarno died in Auckland of pneumonia in 2001. Legacy Described as a socialist bohemian and a social realist painter, his work commissioned by the Australian maritime and mining trade unions is perhaps the best remembered, for its depiction of Australian workers and working conditions. The art historian Bernard Smith wrote of Dalgarno: \\"He belongs to that great generation of social realist Australian artists who flourished during World War II and early post-war years but - in the aftermath of the Cold War - are now largely stored and forgotten by curators.\\" ('Artist of the Everyday' The Australian, 23 February 2001) References External links *Roy Dalgarno -- Tribute to an Artist Category:1910 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Artists from Melbourne Category:Social realist artists Category:20th-century Australian painters ","title":"Roy Dalgarno"},{"id":"894296","text":"\\"Dead Run\\" is the second segment of the nineteenth episode from the first season (1985‚Äì86) of the television series The Twilight Zone. Plot Johnny Davis is a truck driver unemployed due to his many accidents. Johnny asks Pete, a friend of his father, for help in getting a job. Pete is reluctant and warns Johnny that the jobs he takes require unusual resilience and fortitude. Johnny insists that he understands and Pete agrees to take him on his next run. Johnny quickly discovers that the run involves delivering souls to Hell via semi-trailer truck. He also finds out that the souls of the newly dead have been causing disturbances in Hell and it is making the truckers nervous. Dropping their cargo in Hell, Pete and Johnny witness anarchy. Souls run around loose and some of the dead plead with Johnny to rescue them. Other souls attack the drivers, but Gary Frick (another dead man) comes to Johnny's aid. Gary tells Johnny that the cause of the commotion is that people who don't deserve it are being sent to Hell. Gary explains that a new bureaucracy has taken over the job of deciding who goes to Heaven or Hell. Pete and one of the guards in Hell find Johnny, who is summoned to a meeting with upper management. Johnny relates what he heard and saw, and the manager explains how the process works. Johnny thinks the standards used to determine who is sent to Hell are excessive and biased and people are being damned for minor offenses.

Johnny decides to interview the dead that ride with him and then he can decide which of the dead should go to Hell and which he should release (in hopes that they can find a way to Heaven).

The primary service rendered by a law firm is to advise clients (individuals or corporations) about their legal rights and responsibilities, and to represent clients in civil or criminal cases, business transactions, and other matters in which legal advice and other assistance are sought.  Arrangements  Law firms are organized in a variety of ways, depending on the jurisdiction in which the firm practices. Common arrangements include: * Sole proprietorship, in which the attorney is the law firm and is responsible for all profit, loss and liability; * General partnership, in which all the attorneys who are members of the firm share ownership, profits and liabilities; * Professional corporations, which issue stock to the attorneys in a fashion similar to that of a business corporation; * Limited liability company, in which the attorney-owners are called \\"members\\" but are not directly liable to third party creditors of the law firm (prohibited as against public policy in many jurisdictions but allowed in others in the form of a \\"Professional Limited Liability Company\\" or \\"PLLC\\"); * Professional association, which operates similarly to a professional corporation or a limited liability company; * Limited liability partnership (LLP), in which the attorney-owners are partners with one another, but no partner is liable to any creditor of the law firm nor is any partner liable for any negligence on the part of any other partner. The LLP is taxed as a partnership while enjoying the liability protection of a corporation. = Restrictions on ownership interests = In many countries, including the United States, there is a rule that only lawyers may have an ownership interest in, or be managers of, a law firm. Thus, law firms cannot quickly raise capital through initial public offerings on the stock market, like most corporations. They must either raise capital through additional capital contributions from existing or additional equity partners, or must take on debt, usually in the form of a line of credit secured by their accounts receivable. In the United States this complete bar to nonlawyer ownership has been codified by the American Bar Association as paragraph (d) of Rule 5.4 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and has been adopted in one form or another in all U.S. jurisdictions,See Rule 5.4 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct. See also: American Bar Association Commission on Multidisciplinary Practices, Final Report, Appendix C, Reporter‚Äôs notes, July 2000 except the District of Columbia.See Rule 5.4 of the District of Columbia Rules of Professional Conduct However, D.C.'s rule is narrowly tailored to allow equity ownership only by those nonlawyer partners who actively assist the firm's lawyers in providing legal services, and does not allow for the sale of ownership shares to mere passive nonlawyer investors. The U.K. had a similar rule barring nonlawyer ownership, but under reforms implemented by the Legal Services Act of 2007 law firms have been able to take on a limited number of non-lawyer partners and lawyers have been allowed to enter into a wide variety of business relationships with non-lawyers and non-lawyer owned businesses. This has allowed, for example, grocery stores, banks and community organizations to hire lawyers to provide in-store and online basic legal services to customers. The rule is controversial. It is justified by many in the legal profession, notably the American Bar Association which rejected a proposal to change the rule in its Ethics 20/20 reforms, as necessary to prevent conflicts of interest. In the adversarial system of justice, a lawyer has a duty to be a zealous and loyal advocate on behalf of the client, and also has a duty to not bill the client excessively. Also, as an officer of the court, a lawyer has a duty to be honest and to not file frivolous cases or raise frivolous defenses. Many in the legal profession believe that a lawyer working as a shareholder-employee of a publicly traded law firm might be tempted to evaluate decisions in terms of their effect on the stock price and the shareholders, which would directly conflict with the lawyer's duties to the client and to the courts. Critics of the rule, however, believe that it is an inappropriate way of protecting clients' interests and that it severely limits the potential for the innovation of less costly and higher quality legal services that could benefit both ordinary consumers and businesses.See Gillian K. Hadfield \\"Legal Barriers to Innovation: The Growing Economic Cost of Professional Control over Corporate Legal Markets\\" Stanford Law Review 2008; Gillian K. Hadfield \\"The Cost of Law: Promoting Access to Justice through the (Un)Corporate Practice of Law\\" International Review of Law and Economics, 2013 =Multinational law firms= Law firms operating in multiple countries often have complex structures involving multiple partnerships, particularly in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and Japan which restrict partnerships between local and foreign lawyers. One structure largely unique to large multinational law firms is the Swiss Verein, pioneered by Baker & McKenzie in 2004 or as GRATA International, in which multiple national or regional partnerships form an association in which they share branding, administrative functions and various operating costs, but maintain separate revenue pools and often separate partner compensation structures. Other multinational law firms operate as single worldwide partnerships, such as British or American limited liability partnerships, in which partners also participate in local operating entities in various countries as required by local regulations. = Financial indicators = Three financial statistics are typically used to measure and rank law firms' performance: * Profits per equity partner (PPEP or PPP): Net operating income divided by number of equity partners. High PPP is often correlated with prestige of a firm and its attractiveness to potential equity partners. However, the indicator is prone to manipulation by re-classifying less profitable partners as non-equity partners. * Revenue per lawyer (RPL): Gross revenue divided by number of lawyers. This statistic shows the revenue-generating ability of the firm's lawyers in general, but does not factor in the firm's expenses such as associate compensation and office overhead. * Average compensation of partners (ACP): Total amount paid to equity and nonequity partners (i.e., net operating income plus nonequity partner compensation) divided by the total number of equity and nonequity partners. This results in a more inclusive statistic than PPP, but remains prone to manipulation by changing expense policies and re- classifying less profitable partners as associates. Structure and promotion =Partnership= Law firms are typically organized around partners, who are joint owners and business directors of the legal operation; associates, who are employees of the firm with the prospect of becoming partners; and a variety of staff employees, providing paralegal, clerical, and other support services. An associate may have to wait as long as 11 years before the decision is made as to whether the associate is made a partner. Many law firms have an \\"up or out policy\\", integral to the Cravath System, which had been pioneered during the early 20th century by partner Paul Cravath of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, and became widely adopted by, particularly, white- shoe firms;Robert L. Nelson, Partners With Power: The Social Transformation of the Large Law Firm (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), 71-72. associates who do not make partner are required to resign, and may join another firm, become a solo practitioner, work in-house for a corporate legal department, or change professions. Burnout rates are notably high in the profession.Michael H. Trotter, Profit and the Practice of Law: What's Happened to the Legal Profession (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1997), 83. Making partner is very prestigious at large or mid-sized firms, due to the competition that naturally results from higher associate-to-partner ratios. Such firms may take out advertisements in professional publications to announce who has made partner. Traditionally, partners shared directly in the profits of the firm, after paying salaried employees, the landlord, and the usual costs of furniture, office supplies, and books for the law library (or a database subscription). Partners in a limited liability partnership can largely operate autonomously with regard to cultivating new business and servicing existing clients within their book of business. Partner compensation methods vary greatly among law firms. At major United States law firms, the \\"compensation spread\\" (ratio between the highest partner salary and lowest partner salary) among firms disclosing information ranges from 3:1 to 24:1. Higher spreads are intended to promote individual performance, while lower spreads are intended to promote teamwork and collegiality. Many large law firms have moved to a two-tiered partnership model, with equity and non-equity partners. Equity partners are considered to have ownership stakes in the firm, and share in the profits (and losses) of the firm. Non-equity partners are generally paid a fixed salary (albeit much higher than associates), and they are often granted certain limited voting rights with respect to firm operations. The oldest continuing partnership in the United States is that of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, founded in 1792, in New York City. The oldest law firm in continuous practice in the United States is Rawle & Henderson LLP, founded in 1783, in Philadelphia.  Termination of one's partnership  It is rare for a partner to be forced out by fellow partners, although that can happen if the partner commits a crime or malpractice, experiences disruptive mental illness, or is not contributing to the firm's overall profitability. However, some large firms have written into their partnership agreement a forced retirement age for partners, which can be anywhere from age 65 on up. In contrast, most corporate executives are at much higher risk of being fired, even when the underlying cause is not directly their fault, such as a drop in the company's stock price. Worldwide, partner retirement ages can be difficult to estimate and often vary widely, particularly because in many countries it is illegal to mandate a retirement age. =\\"Of counsel\\" role= In the United States, Canada and Japan, many large and midsize firms have attorneys with the job title of \\"counsel\\", \\"special counsel\\" or \\"of counsel.\\" As the Supreme Court of California has noted, the title has acquired several related but distinct definitions which do not easily fit into the traditional partner-associate structure.See People ex rel. Dept. of Corporations v. SpeeDee Oil Change Systems, Inc., 20 Cal. 4th 1135, 1152-1153 (1999). These attorneys are people who work for the firm, like associates, although some firms have an independent contractor relationship with their counsel. But unlike associates, and more like partners, they generally have their own clients, manage their own cases, and supervise associates. These relationships are structured to allow more senior attorneys to share in the resources and \\"brand name\\" of the firm without being a part of management or profit sharing decisions. The title is often seen among former associates who do not make partner, or who are laterally recruited to other firms, or who work as in- house counsel and then return to the big firm environment. At some firms, the title \\"of counsel\\" is given to retired partners who maintain ties to the firm. Sometimes \\"of counsel\\" refers to senior or experienced attorneys, such as foreign legal consultants, with specialized experience in particular aspects of law and practice. They are hired as independent contractors by large firms as a special arrangement, which may lead to profitable results for the partnership. In certain situations \\"of counsel\\" could be considered to be a transitional status in the firm. =Mergers and acquisitions between law firms= Mergers, acquisitions, division and reorganizations occur between law firms as in other businesses. The specific books of business and specialization of attorneys as well as the professional ethical structures surrounding conflict of interest can lead to firms splitting up to pursue different clients or practices, or merging or recruiting experienced attorneys to acquire new clients or practice areas. Results often vary between firms experiencing such transitions. Firms that gain new practice areas or departments through recruiting or mergers that are more complex and demanding (and typically more profitable) may see the focus, organization and resources of the firm shift dramatically towards those new departments. Conversely, firms may be merged among experienced attorneys as partners for purposes of shared financing and resources, while the different departments and practice areas within the new firm retain a significant degree of autonomy. Law firm mergers tend to be assortative, in that only law firms operating in similar legal systems are likely to merge. For example, U.S. firms will often merge with English law firms, or law firms from other common law jurisdictions. A notable exception is King & Wood Mallesons, a multinational law firm that is the result of a merger between an Australian law firm and a Chinese law firm. Though mergers are more common among better economies, slowing down a bit during recessions, big firms sometimes use mergers as a strategy to boost revenue during a recession. Nevertheless, data from Altman Weil indicates that only four firms merged in the first half of 2013, as compared to eight in the same period in 2012, and this was taken by them as indicating a dip in morale regarding the legal economy and the amount of demand. Size Law firms can vary widely in size. The smallest law firms are lawyers practicing alone, who form the vast majority of lawyers in nearly all countries.Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. & Angelo Dondi, Legal Ethics: A Comparative Study (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004), 39. Smaller firms tend to focus on particular specialties of the law (e.g. patent law, labor law, tax law, criminal defense, personal injury); larger firms may be composed of several specialized practice groups, allowing the firm to diversify its client base and market, and to offer a variety of services to their clients.Wayne L. Anderson and Marilyn J. Headrick, The Legal Profession: Is it for you? (Cincinnati: Thomson Executive Press, 1996), 111. Large law firms usually have separate litigation and transactional departments. The transactional department advises clients and handles transactional legal work, such as drafting contracts, handling necessary legal applications and filings, and evaluating and ensuring compliance with relevant law; while the litigation department represents clients in court and handles necessary matters (such as discovery and motions filed with the court) throughout the process of litigation. = Anglo-American development =  Boutique law firms  Lawyers in small cities and towns may still have old-fashioned general practices, but most urban lawyers tend to be highly specialized due to the overwhelming complexity of the law today.Nelson, 172, and Trotter, 50. Thus, some small firms in the cities specialize in practicing only one kind of law (like employment, antitrust, intellectual property, investment funds, telecommunications or aviation) and are called boutique law firms.Lawrence M. Friedman, American Law in the 20th Century (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002), 462.  Virtual Law Firms  A 21st Century development has been the appearance of the virtual law firm, a firm with a virtual business address but no brick & mortar office location open to the public, using modern telecommunications to operate from remote locations and provide its services to international clients, avoiding the costs of maintaining a physical premises with lower overheads than traditional law firms. This lower cost structure allows virtual law firms to bill clients on a contingency basis rather than by billable hours paid in advance by retainer. Related innovations include alternative legal services provider (ALSP), legal outsourcing and what is sometimes called \\"NewLaw\\". The largest law firms have more than lawyers. These firms, often colloquially called \\"megafirms\\" or \\"biglaw\\", generally have offices on several continents, bill US$750 per hour or higher, and have a high ratio of support staff per attorney.Trotter, 56.Richard L. Abel, American Lawyers (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 190-199. Because of the localized and regional nature of firms, the relative size of a firm varies.Anderson, 113. = \\"Full service\\" firms = The largest firms like to call themselves \\"Big-Law\\" firms because they have sections specializing on each category of legal work, which in the U.S. usually means mergers and acquisitions transactions,Friedman, 462. banking, and certain types of high-stakes corporate litigation. These firms rarely do plaintiffs' personal injury work. However the largest law firms are not very large compared to other major businesses (or even other professional services firms). In 2008, the largest law firm in the world was the British firm Clifford Chance, which had revenue of over US$2 billion. This can be compared with $404 billion for the world's largest firm by turnover Exxon Mobil and $28 billion for the largest professional services firm Deloitte. = Worldwide = The largest law firms in the world are headquartered primarily in the United Kingdom and the United States. However, large firms of more than 1,000 lawyers are also found in Australia (Minter Ellison, 1,500 attorneys), China (Dacheng, 2,100 attorneys) and Spain (Garrigues, 2,100 attorneys). The American system of licensing attorneys on a state-by-state basis, the tradition of having a headquarters in a single U.S. state and a close focus on profits per partner (as opposed to sheer scale) has to date limited the size of most American law firms. Thus, whilst the most profitable law firms in the world remain in New York, four of the six largest firms in the world are based in London in the United Kingdom. But the huge size of the United States results in a larger number of large firms overall ‚Äì a 2003 paper noted that the United States alone had 901 law firms with more than 50 lawyers, while there were only 58 such firms in Canada, 44 in Great Britain, 14 in France, and 9 in Germany.Eliane Botelho Junqueira, \\"Brazil: The Road of Conflict Bound for Total Justice,\\" in Legal Culture in the Age of Globalization: Latin America and Latin Europe, eds. Lawrence M. Friedman and Rogelio P√©rez-Perdomo, 64-107 (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2003), 92. There is an increasing tendency towards globalisation of law firms. Due to their size, the U.S.- and U.K.-based law firms are the most prestigious and powerful in the world, and they tend to dominate the international market for legal services. A 2007 research paper noted that firms from other countries merely pick up their leftovers: \\"[M]uch of the competition is relatively orderly whereby predominantly Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian firms compete for business not required by English or American law firms.\\"Ashly H. Pinnington & John T. Gray, \\"The global restructuring of legal services work? A study of the internationalisation of Australian law firms,\\" 14 Int'l J. Legal Prof. 147, 151-152 (2007). = Recession = As a result of the U.S. recession in 2008 and 2009 many U.S. law firms have downsized staff considerably, and some have closed. The Denver Post reported that major law firms have cut more than 10,000 jobs nationwide in 2009. On February 12, 2009, Bloomberg reported that 700 jobs were cut that one day at law firms across the country. Among the firms closed included Heller Ehrman, a San Francisco-based firm established in 1890 and Halliwells of the UK.'Halliwells administrators report reveals details of financial fallout', Legal Week, 20 Sep 2010 Among those that survived, law firm layoffs became so common that trade publications like American Lawyer produced an ongoing ‚ÄúLayoff List‚Äù of the law firms nationwide that cut jobs.American Lawyer, The Layoff List, 3 Sept 2009 Salaries Law firm salary structures typically depend on firm size. Small-firm salaries vary widely within countries and from one country to the next, and are not often publicly available. Because most countries do not have unified legal professions, there are often significant disparities in income among the various legal professions within a particular country. Finally, the availability of salary data also depends upon the existence of journalists and sociologists able to collect and analyze such data. The Association of Legal Administrators (ALA) produces an annual study on Law Firm Compensation and Benefits, and can be found at http://alanet.org/compsurvey = United States = The U.S. is presently the only country with enough lawyers, as well as journalists and sociologists who specialize in studying them, to have widely available data on salary structures at major law firms. In 2006, median salaries of new graduates ranged from US$50,000 per year in small firms (2 to 10 attorneys) to US$160,000 per year in very large firms (more than 501 attorneys). The distribution of these salaries was highly bimodal, with the majority of new lawyers earning at either the high end or the low end of the scale, and a median salary of US$62,000.\\"What Do New Lawyers Earn? A 15-Year Retrospective as Reported by Law School Graduates\\". . The Association for Legal Career Professionals, In the summer of 2016, New York law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore raised its first-year associate salary to $180,000. Many other high-end New York-based and large national law firms soon followed. Two years later, in the summer of 2018, the Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy raised its first-year associate salary to $190,000, with other major firms following shortly thereafter. The traditional salary model for law firm associates is lockstep compensation, in which associate salaries go up by a fixed amount each year from the associate's law school graduation. However, many firms have switched to a level-based compensation system, in which associates are divided into three (or sometimes four) levels based on skills mastered. In 2013, the median salaries for the three associate levels were $152,500, $185,000 and $216,000 among large firms (more than 700 lawyers), and $122,000, $143,500 and $160,000 among all firms. Some prominent law firms, like Goodwin Procter and Paul Hastings, give generous signing bonuses (e.g., $20k) to incoming first- year associates who hold JD/MBA degrees. Another way law firm associates increase their earnings or improve their employment conditions is through a lateral move to another law firm. A recent survey by LexisNexis indicated that over 95% of law firms consulted intended to hire lateral attorneys within the next two years. Though the success for both the attorney and the law firms in lateral hiring has been questioned. The National Law Review reported that the cost of recruiting, compensating, and integrating a lateral attorney can be upwards of $600,000 and that 60% of lateral attorney hires fail to thrive at their new law firms. =United Kingdom= British firms typically practise lockstep compensation. In London, entry-level solicitor salaries (NQ - Newly Qualified) are typically: (i) ¬£40,000-70,000 at boutique and national firms, (ii) ¬£80,000-100,000 at magic circle firms, and (iii) ¬£120,000-¬£155,000 at London offices of leading US firms. A senior associate with six years' experience may make ¬£68,000-120,000 at a national firm or upwards of ¬£160,000 at a global firm. Salary levels are lower in areas outside London. =Australia= Australia has regional variation in lawyer salaries, with the highest salary levels in Sydney, followed by Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, then Adelaide. Salaries vary between top-tier, mid-size, and small firms. At top- tier firms in Sydney, salaries of lawyers who have been admitted to practice range from $75,000 to $92,000 and partners make on average $1,215,000. In Sydney, mid-tier starting salaries for admitted lawyers range from between $65,000 and $82,000 Most Australian lawyers are not admitted until 10 months into their time at their law firm, since the initial period involves supervised legal training before admission is granted. Typically in Australian firms lawyers are in a lock-step system for the first two years of practice, following which pay increases are dependent on performance assessed, in large measure, by satisfaction of billable hour targets. =Hong Kong= Newly qualified associates at leading firms in Hong Kong typically make HK$840,000 to HK$948,000, with partners in the HK$1.6 million to HK$4 million+ range; many firms pay New York salaries with cost of living adjustments. =Singapore= At local firms in Singapore, associates in their first three years typically make $60,000 to $100,000, while midlevel (4‚Äì7 years) associates make $110,000 to $180,000 and senior (8+ years) associates make $160,000 or more. International firms pay significantly more, with senior associates often making more than $250,000. =India= There is more information available for entry level soups. First year lawyers earn anywhere between INR 8,000 to INR 1,10,000 a month. Tier 1 law firms provide the best pay package, of about INR 15,00,000 annually. There is wide difference in the salary range depending on the city, law firm, university of the candidate and the smartness of the candidate. The salary is more in cities like Mumbai and Delhi as opposed to other cities like Kolkata, Benaras, Pune, Ahmedabad, etc.. Location Most law firms are located in office buildings of various sizes, ranging from modest one-story buildings to some of the tallest skyscrapers in the world (though only in 2004, Paul Hastings was the first firm to put its name on a skyscraper). In late 2001, it was widely publicized that John C. Dearie's personal injury plaintiffs' firm in the state of New York has been experimenting with bus-sized \\"mobile law offices.\\" The firm insists that it does not \\"chase ambulances.\\" It claims that a law office on wheels is more convenient for personal injury plaintiffs, who are often recovering from severe injuries and thus find it difficult to travel far from their homes for an intake interview.  Rankings  Law firms are ranked both objectively, such as by profits per partner, and subjectively, by various legal publishers and journalists. As legal practice is adversarial, law firm rankings are widely relied on by prospective associates, lateral hires and legal clients. Subjective rankings typically cover practice areas such as The American Lawyer's Corporate Scorecard and Top IP Firms. Work place rankings are directed toward lawyers or law students, and cover such topics as quality of life, hours, family friendliness and salaries. Finally, statistical rankings generally cover profit-related data such as profits per partner and revenue per lawyer. Third party attorney ranking services such as Chambers and Partners and Martindale-Hubbell are generally very competitive and can help raise an individual attorney's professional profile, and to catch this marketing advantage, over 1,200 attorney ranking and or awards have sprung up in the U.S. Various state bar associations have taken notice of the prolific growth of attorney honor awards and have determined that lawyers may refer to such honors in advertising ‚Äúonly when the basis for comparison can be verified‚Äù and the organization providing the award ‚Äúhas made adequate inquiry into the fitness of the individual lawyer.‚Äù In an October 2007 press conference reported in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, the law student group Building a Better Legal Profession released its first annual ranking of top law firms by average billable hours, pro bono participation, and demographic diversity.Amir Efrati, You Say You Want a Big-Law Revolution, Take II, The Wall Street Journal, October 10, 2007.Adam Liptak, In Students‚Äô Eyes, Look-Alike Lawyers Don‚Äôt Make the Grade, The New York Times, October 29, 2007 Most notably, the report ranked the percentages of women, African- Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans, and gays & lesbians at America's top law firms. The group has sent the information to top law schools around the country, encouraging students to take this demographic data into account when choosing where to work after graduation.Henry Weinstein, Big L.A. law firms score low on diversity survey: The numbers of female, black, Latino, Asian and gay partners and associates lag significantly behind their representation in the city's population, according to a study, Los Angeles Times, October 11, 2007 As more students choose where to work based on the firms' diversity rankings, firms face an increasing market pressure in order to attract top recruits.Thomas Adcock and Zusha Elinson, Student Group Grades Firms On Diversity, Pro Bono Work, New York Law Journal, October 19, 2007 In popular culture A number of television shows, movies and books have revolved around relationships occurring in fictional law firms, highlighting both public fascination with and misperception of the lives of lawyers in high-powered settings. One popular American legal drama television series is called Suits. There is one popular American dramedy, also known as, comedy-drama called Boston Legal which was created by David E. Kelley and produced in association with 20th Century Fox Television for ABC. It is a spin-off of another long running Kelly series, The Practice, following the exploits of former character Alan Shore at the legal firm of Crane, Poole & Schmidt. One famous legal movie is called The Firm, which was adapted from a book written by John Grisham.

One of the first Soviet efforts to use space to deliver weapons, FOBS envisioned launching nuclear warheads into low Earth orbit before bringing them down on their targets. Like a kinetic bombardment system but with nuclear weapons, FOBS had several attractive qualities: it had no range limit, its flight path would not reveal the target location, and warheads could be directed to North America over the South Pole, evading detection by NORAD's north-facing early warning systems. The maximum altitude would be around 150km. Energetically, this would require a launch vehicle powerful enough to be capable of putting the weapon 'into orbit'. However the orbit was only a fraction of a full orbit, not sustained, and so there would be much less need to control a precise orbit, or to maintain it long term.  Development history and deployment  = Lead-up to FOBS development = Some USSR officials began expressing a desire for a FOBS-type weapon around the time of Sputnik's launch. By the early 1960s, the Soviet Union felt that pursuing a system like the FOBS would be a natural next step given their belief that the US was already planning to use space to mount nuclear attacks The success of the Soviet Vostok program which saw a rocket send a human into orbit and then land at a predesignated location made this kind of weapon seem more feasible. = Competing FOBS designs = Soviet rocket engineer Sergei Korolev seems to have been responsible for the first FOBS-type missile design. His offering was the GR-1; it was also known as 'Global Missile 1' within Korolev's design bureau, as SS-X-10 Scrag by NATO authorities, and as 11A513 (or 8K73) by Soviet GRAU index. Korolev's research began as early as 1960 and the GR-1 project was sanctioned by Soviet officials on September 24, 1962. Korolev brought up the idea of the GR-1 to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in early 1962. Soon after, Khrushchev announced that the Soviet Union was capable of utilizing \\"global missiles\\" that could fly over both the North and South Poles on their way to a target, continuing on to say that this type of weapon would render early warning radar systems practically obsolete and leave the enemy with no time to retaliate before the weapon's impact. Korolev's engineers first estimated that NATO radar systems would detect the GR-1's warhead only two minutes before arrival. The GR-1 was to use the NK-9 and NK-9V as main engines in its first and second stages respectively. Though the NK-9 and NK-9V weren't created by Korolev's team, the GR-1's 8D726 retrorocket engine was. This engine would prove to be instrumental to the progress of Russian rocketry, specifically for its importance in the development of the Blok-D upper stage of rockets like the N1, Proton, and Zenit. The GR-1 had three stages and a total vehicle mass of 117 tons. It was 35.31 meters long with a 2.68 meter diameter and could carry a single 2.2 megaton yield nuclear warhead. It was cryogenic liquid propelled, utilizing a mix of RG-1 kerosene with liquid oxygen (LOX). Two other FOBS-type missile projects emerged around the time of the GR-1's early development. It seems that each of these projects were competing with one another for usage selection. The first of the two other projects was that of Soviet missile engineer Vladimir Chelomey who proposed two designs: one called the UR-200A (GRAU index 8K83) that was derivative of his UR-200 ICBM and another designated as GR-2 which built off of his colossal UR-500 prototype ICBM and had a much larger explosive yield of 30 megatons. The UR-200A design was eventually selected for further development over the GR-2. It was to use the RD-0202 and RD-0205 engines for its first and second stages respectively and be equipped with an AB-200 aeroballistic warhead. Unlike the GR-1, the UR-200 and its derivatives used storable (or hypergolic) liquid propellants; specifically nitrogen tetroxide and UDMH. Chelomey and his engineers received development authorization for the UR-200 ICBM on March 16, 1961, beginning work on the UR-200A variant at some point after. The second of the two other projects came from the Soviet missile designer Mikhail Yangel. His proposal was the R-36O (8K69 by GRAU index and SS-9 Mod 3 Scarp by NATO report) which was approved for development by Soviet officials on April 16, 1962. Yangel used an ICBM design of his own, the R-36 (NATO designation SS-9 Scarp), as a base for the R-36O. The missile had three stages, using the RD-251 engine in its first stage and the RD-252 engine in its second stage. The weapon's third stage was related to the deorbiting process as well as warhead guidance and delivery; the Soviets referred to this system as OGCh. An aiming system inside the OGCh would check and rectify trajectory issues in relation to the desired target location through the use of various instruments (for instance, a radio altimeter used in conjunction with an inertial navigation system). The aiming system would make its checks directly after the missile came into orbit and immediately before third stage ignition. Deorbiting would be induced by the missile's retrorocket, the RD-854 engine, causing the warhead to take on a ballistic path towards its target. The warhead, retrorocket, and guidance system were each contained inside the OGCh module. A series of nozzles on the RD-854 enabled aerial maneuvering of the OGCh. Other nozzles facilitated the separation of the warhead from the rest of the OGCh, allowing it to fall alone on a ballistic path to the target. The R-36O's 8F021 warhead had an explosive yield between 5-20 megatons according to Soviet sources. Western intelligence suggests that the yield was smaller, being somewhere between 1-3.5 megatons. The missile was 32.60 meters long with a 3.00 meter diameter and a total launch mass of 180 tons. The R-36O used the same hypergolic propellants as the UR-200. = Yangel design selection = In 1965, Soviet military officials worked to select one of the three FOBS projects. The R-36O of Yangel's design bureau was chosen for further development over the others. The reasoning behind the Soviet FOBS design selection process remains somewhat unclear. A particularly confounding factor to consider is that none of the three proposed missiles had undergone a single test flight prior to the R-36O's selection. Even so, there are some explanations as to why Yangel's design was chosen in the end. These revolve around the occurrence of negative events in the competing GR-1 and UR-200A projects that effectively knocked them out of contention. One strike against Korolev's GR-1 was that it used a cryogenic propellant, thereby rendering the missile a poor candidate for operational storage in a missile silo as the Soviet military desired. Other negative factors include that the GR-1's 8D726 retrorocket was demonstrating a proclivity for failure in its initial tests and, as a cause for yet more worry, the troublesome R-9A (the subject of a different ongoing Korolev ICBM project) was quite similar to the GR-1 in construction; thus, military leadership was encouraged to look elsewhere for more immediate progress. The GR-1's ability to deal with US ABM systems and its lengthy fueling process were also questioned by Soviet analysts. There were also significant delays associated with the production of the GR-1's NK-9 engine (of which the Kuznetsov bureau was responsible for). Under the weight of these issues, the GR-1 project finally fell apart in January 1965. Chelomey's UR-200A project lost a great deal of support after Khrushchev, his most important political ally, was ousted in 1964. Military authorities under the Brezhnev administration were far less friendly to Chelomey and quick to deem the R-36O a better choice for further FOBS development. Having lost the ability to tap into the Soviet Premier's influence, Chelomey ultimately failed to secure the survival of the UR-200A, its development coming to an end in 1965. = Flight testing and deployment = At its missile range near Baikonur, Kazakhstan, the Soviet Union tested and deployed the R-36O. A testing station and a horizontal assembly facility were constructed for the missile's development initially. Over most of 1965, two R-36 test pads were modified to work with the R-36O for its early test flights. In addition, 18 silos capable of launching the R-36O were built over the mid 1960s to 1971; three rounds of construction occurred with six silos being built each time. Those built in the same area were placed 10-15 kilometers away from one another to prevent the possibility of a single nuclear strike destroying multiple silos. The Soviet Union originally planned nineteen R-36O launches, but 24 were carried out by 1971. The initial four were to begin from a ground-based testing pad and then fly to the Kamchatka Peninsula. The other tests called for the R-36O to be launched from a silo into orbit where it would then execute its third stage deorbit process over the Pacific Ocean; the missile's payload would be retrofired into Soviet territory. Over 2000 Soviet service people participated in the tests. Six of the tests were outright failures while the others achieved either complete or partial success. Prior to the first launches, the Soviet Union stated that a \\"space vehicle landing system\\" was being tested over the Pacific. The first test flight occurred on December 16, 1965. It missed the landing area by a wide margin owing to a stabilization instrument malfunction. The second test was on February 5, 1966 and was also a failure due to a retrorocket issue. The third test took place on March 16, 1966. Nitrogen tetroxide spilled over the surface pad during fueling due to a miscommunication and the missile was quickly destroyed by fire. Some success was had with the fourth test on May 20, 1966, but the payload didn't break away from the missile's guidance system as intended. The following tests were conducted from silos. The first two tests of the silo phase ended in the intentional destruction (via self- destruct functionality) of the R-36O as a result of the second stage engine accidentally being activated for too long, sending the payload into an unplanned orbit. NATO radar systems picked up on the large mass of resulting debris. In one failed test case, small pieces of the missile rained down on the midwestern United States. In 1967, the Soviet Union conducted ten more R-36O tests, nine of them seeing some level of success. In that year and beyond, the Soviet Union used public statements about satellite launch tests as cover for any R-36O test that was intended to put its payload into orbit for some period of time. On November 19, 1968, about a month after the 20th test, the Soviet Union designated the R-36O as operational and began its deployment in three groups of six. By 1971, all 18 of the Soviet Union's R-36O silos were in service in Kazakhstan. NATO intelligence suggests that a primary target was the US Grand Forks Air Force Base where an ABM system was set to be established in the late 1960s to early 1970s. The R-36O wasn't equipped with a nuclear payload until 1972.  Reasons for development  The Soviet Union identified a number of strategic advantages of the FOBS. The following points prompted its development: * The system granted unlimited striking range with a nuclear weapon. * The system allowed a strike to be carried out from any direction. For instance, the Soviet Union could launch an attack against the United States using a South Pole or North Pole flight path; technically, it could even execute both of these attack plans simultaneously. * The system provided a way of evading early warning radar systems. This advantage comes from two different attributes of the FOBS: (1) that it could attack from any direction, as stated above, and (2) that it could travel along a very low Earth orbital path. The first point has to do with the fact that one of the primary missile defense radar systems of the US around the time of the FOBS' early development was the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS). The BMEWS was oriented to detect ballistic missiles coming from the aforementioned 'North Pole route' (its three stations being located in Alaska, Greenland, and the United Kingdom) and therefore wouldn't detect a strike flying along a southern orbital path. The second point considers that FOBS missiles could fly relatively close to the Earth's surface; they could have a perigee of under 100 miles and an apogee as low as 125 miles above the ground (see apsis). US radar systems like the BMEWS were configured to detect ICBMs that flew several hundred to upwards of 1000 miles above the surface, not low altitude missiles like that of the FOBS. Thus, the Soviet Union felt that striking with a FOBS would deprive the United States of valuable warning time that ICBMs were likely to give away, time that could be used to mount a devastating retaliatory attack. *The system concealed the target location until the payload was dropped out of orbit. Theoretically, the FOBS was capable of staying in orbit for several orbits, at most, due to the exceptionally low trajectory, but could separate its warhead from the FOBS vehicle at any given point in the orbit. *The FOBS' flight duration was shorter than that of an ICBM (assuming an indirect route isn't taken for the purpose of radar evasion). A FOBS missile may have been able to reach its target around 10 minutes before an ICBM would. *The Soviet Union supposed that the FOBS would be capable of trumping US anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems. This was actually a primary objective of the Soviet FOBS from its origin. On one hand, the FOBS was seen as a tool that could boost the effectiveness of a Soviet ICBM strike by first eliminating some of the enemy's safeguards (like ABM systems). Given the notion that a FOBS missile could not be destroyed by an ABM system, it also follows that the FOBS could be used alone to carry out a nuclear attack. In late 1967, US officials indicated that they could develop ABMs to counter the Soviet FOBS, the implication being that it was indeed capable of besting American ABM systems at that time and beforehand.  End of deployment and associated reasons  There are two main technical disadvantages of the FOBS to consider: * Its nuclear payload was drastically reduced relative to that of an ICBM due to the high level of energy needed to get the weapon into orbit. According to American intelligence, the FOBS' nuclear warhead mass needed to be roughly to of that of an ICBM,and required a more robust ablative system, due to the higher entry velocities. * The FOBS was less accurate than an ICBM. This was empirically demonstrated in the series of Soviet R-36O flight tests that occurred over 1965-1971. There are a number of other factors to consider that prompted the end of FOBS deployment in the Soviet Union: * The FOBS wouldn't be able to overcome later early warning radar system developments made by the US, especially those that came in the form of space-based radar deployments. The US established missile detection systems of this type by the early 1970s. The FOBS was made to counter relatively simple ground-based systems like the BMEWS, not the more expansive radar network that followed it. The Soviet FOBS thus had lost one of its primary capabilities only several years into its deployment, a FOBS strike no longer having an adequate probability of going undetected by the US. *An additional primary use of the Soviet FOBS‚Äîits ability to counter an American ABM system‚Äîwas found out to be needless as time passed. Contrary to earlier Soviet projections, the US never built a large ABM system purposed in fending off a Soviet ICBM attack. The only significant American ABM system constructed was Safeguard (initially called Sentinel), but it was shut down by 1976 and mainly China-oriented anyway; it would have been practically useless in the face of anything beyond a limited Soviet nuclear attack regardless of the FOBS. *Soviet SLBM technology grew into a good replacement for the FOBS on the basis of low flight time, high range (via the submarine's ability to move near its target), and the element of surprise. *The FOBS potentially acted as a dangerous accelerant to the Cold War arms race for the reason that it was most useful in the context of a pre-emptive nuclear strike. A nation observing their enemy developing the FOBS could logically conclude that they viewed a first strike as a viable nuclear strategy; the observing nation may react to this realization by ramping up its own weapon production and perhaps adopting a first strike nuclear strategy as well. The Soviet Union began decommissioning and dismantling the FOBS deployment in 1982 (officially in January 1983). The R36-O missile was completely removed from service by February 1983. Starting in May 1984, the Soviet Union razed its FOBS-capable silos. There's confusion over whether all 18 silos were destroyed. One source suggests that six silos were instead modified for the purpose of ICBM modernization testing, as per a SALT II agreement (see Outer Space Treaty and SALT II).  Outer Space Treaty and SALT II  Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 stated that: > Parties to the Treaty undertake not to place in orbit around the Earth any > objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass > destruction, install such weapons on celestial bodies, or station such > weapons in outer space in any other manner. The overriding opinion of US administrators was that the Soviet FOBS did not violate the treaty, mostly for the reason that the system didn't go into a full orbit. For instance, US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara argued that the Soviet Union had only agreed \\"not to place [nuclear] warheads in orbit,\\" continuing on to point out that the FOBS executes its mission on a \\"fractional orbit, not a full orbit.\\" Senator Henry M. Jackson, chairman of the Joint Atomic Energy Subcommittee on Military Applications, countered that the Soviet FOBS was at least a \\"good faith violation of the treaty,\\" alluding to the notion that the weapon could go into technical orbit. This is certainly true: the only thing stopping the Soviet FOBS' payload from completing a full revolution around the Earth (and thereby literally going orbital and violating the treaty) was the firing of the system's retrorocket. Even so, McNamara also drew attention to the fact that the treaty didn't ban any form of weapons testing‚Äînot even the testing of an orbital nuclear weapons system. None of the Soviet Union's test R-36Os were ever equipped with a nuclear warhead; so, even if it were the case that the launches went orbital, they still wouldn't have broken the treaty. Unlike the Outer Space Treaty, the SALT II agreement of 1979 explicitly prohibited the pursuance and deployment of the FOBS: The SALT II agreement was never ratified by the United States Senate. The Soviet Union ultimately complied with its terms anyway, decommissioning its FOBS in 1983 (see the 'End of deployment and associated reasons' section). The agreement also stipulated that 12 of the 18 Soviet FOBS launchers in Kazakhstan were to be taken apart or demolished and never replaced. This was meant to happen within an eight month period following the treaty's ratification. The terms allowed the USSR to modify the six remaining launchers to fit missile modernization testing purposes.  American view  As early as 1962, the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) suspected that the Soviet Union would develop a space-oriented bombardment system like the FOBS. While it's true that the US thought about creating orbital bombardment weapons in the early 1960s, these inquires tapered off by 1963, the conclusion being that they didn't offer enough meaningful advantages over the ICBM. The US conclusively decided not to develop a FOBS in particular in 1963. American intelligence officials thus initially found no reason to believe that the Soviet Union was intending to deploy such a weapon in any militarily significant capacity, supposing that the Soviets instead sought to use this technology for \\"propaganda or political reasons\\" if anything. The CIA made note of the Soviet Union's R-36O test launches and realized that they were more serious about the military applications of a FOBS-type weapon than originally expected. Still, by October 1968, around a month before the R-36O was declared operational by the USSR, it remained unclear to the CIA whether the tests they had observed involved a FOBS or a \\"depressed trajectory\\" ICBM. Prior to this report, the CIA had higher confidence in their belief that FOBS development was taking place in the USSR. This assessment prompted Secretary of Defense McNamara to announce that the Soviet Union was possibly creating a FOBS at a news conference on November 3, 1967. This was the first time that the FOBS project had ever been explicitly referred to in public (though Khrushchev alluded to this kind of weapon in the early 1960s). McNamara emphasized that the potential Soviet FOBS did not worry him in consideration of its disadvantages compared to the ICBM. At a congressional hearing soon after, John S. Foster Jr., Director of Defense Research and Engineering, stated that the US had been developing \\"over-the-horizon\\" radar networks capable of detecting a FOBS since 1963; these radars were designed to give approximately 30 minutes warning time in the case of a FOBS strike. He went on to say that the US would continue to allocate significant funding to early warning radar projects of this sort. It can be noted that the US' view that the FOBS wasn't particularly useful militarily is a possible explanation as to why the Soviet FOBS was defended by McNamara and others in the context of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. The idea is that they weren't willing to see the treaty break down over a single issue like the FOBS, especially given that they had already evaluated it as a minor threat in the grand scheme of that period's nuclear weapon landscape.

Chester, directed by Eug√®ne Louri√©, that stars Paul Christian, Paula Raymond, Cecil Kellaway, and Kenneth Tobey. The film's stop-motion animation special effects are by Ray Harryhausen. Its screenplay is based on Ray Bradbury's 1951 short story \\"The Fog Horn\\", specifically the scene where a lighthouse is destroyed by the title character. The film's story concerns a fictional dinosaur, the Rhedosaurus, which is released from its frozen, hibernating state by an atomic bomb test in the Arctic Circle. The beast begins to wreak a path of destruction as it travels southward, eventually arriving at its ancient spawning grounds, which includes New York City. The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms was one of the early atomic monster movies, and it helped inspire a generation of creature features and directly inspired Godzilla (Gojira).Jones 1995, p. 42.Hood, Robert. \\"A Potted History of Godzilla.\\" roberthood.net. Retrieved: January 30, 2015. Plot Far north of the Arctic Circle, a nuclear bomb test, dubbed \\"Operation Experiment\\", is conducted. Prophetically, right after the blast, physicist Thomas Nesbitt muses \\"What the cumulative effects of all these atomic explosions and tests will be, only time will tell\\". The explosion awakens a long carnivorous dinosaur known as a Rhedosaurus,The Dinosaur Films of Ray Harryhausen: Features, Early 16mm Experiments and Unrealized Projects by Roy P. Webber thawing it out of the ice where it had been held in suspended animation for millions of years. Nesbitt is the only surviving witness to the beast's awakening and later is dismissed out-of-hand as being delirious at the time of his sighting. Despite the skepticism, he persists, knowing what he saw. The dinosaur begins making its way down the east coast of North America, sinking a fishing ketch off the Grand Banks, destroying another near Marquette, Canada, wrecking a lighthouse in Maine and destroying buildings in Massachusetts. Nesbitt eventually gains allies in paleontologist Thurgood Elson and his young assistant Lee Hunter after one of the surviving fishermen identifies from a collection of drawings the very same dinosaur that Nesbitt saw. Plotting the sightings of the beast's appearances on a map for skeptical military officers, Elson proposes the dinosaur is returning to the Hudson River area, where fossils of Rhedosaurus were first found. In a diving bell search of the undersea Hudson River Canyon, Professor Elson is killed after his bell is swallowed by the beast, which eventually comes ashore in Manhattan. A later newspaper report of its rampage lists \\"180 known dead, 1500 injured, damage estimates $300 million\\". Meanwhile, military troops led by Colonel Jack Evans attempt to stop the Rhedosaurus with an electrified barricade, then blast a hole with a bazooka in the beast's throat, which drives it back into the sea. Unfortunately, it bleeds all over the streets of New York, unleashing a horrible, virulent prehistoric contagion, which begins to infect the populace, causing even more fatalities. The infection precludes blowing up the Rhedosaurus or even setting it ablaze, lest the contagion spread further. It is decided to shoot a radioactive isotope into the beast's neck wound with hopes of burning it from the inside, killing it without releasing the contagion. When the Rhedosaurus comes ashore and reaches Palisades amusement park, military sharpshooter Corporal Stone takes a rifle grenade loaded with a potent radioactive isotope and climbs on board a roller coaster. Riding the coaster to the top of the tracks, so he can get to eye-level with the beast, he fires the isotope into its open neck wound. It thrashes about in reaction, causing the roller coaster to spark when falling to the ground, setting the amusement park ablaze. With the fire spreading rapidly, the park becomes engulfed in flames. The Rhedosaurus collapses and eventually dies from isotope poisoning and heat stroke.

The film was announced in the trades as The Monster from Beneath the Sea. During preproduction in 1951, Ray Harryhausen brought to Dietz and Chester's attention that Ray Bradbury had just published a short story in The Saturday Evening Post titled \\"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\\" (it later was anthologized under the title \\"The Fog Horn\\").Ray Bradbury, The Golden Apples of the Sun, Doubleday, March 1953. This story was about a marine-based prehistoric dinosaur that destroys a lighthouse. A similar sequence appeared in the draft script of The Monster from Beneath the Sea. The producers, wishing to share in Bradbury's reputation and popularity, promptly bought the rights to his story and changed the film's title to match the story's title. Bradbury's name was used extensively in the promotional campaign. It also had an on-screen credit that read \\"Suggested by the Saturday Evening Post Story by Ray Bradbury\\".Glut, Donald F. (1982) The Dinosaur Scrapbook, Citadel Press An original music score was composed by Michel Michelet, but when Warner Bros. purchased the film, it had a new score written by David Buttolph. Ray Harryhausen had been hoping that his film music hero Max Steiner, under contract at the time with Warner Bros., would write the film score. Steiner had written the landmark score for RKO's King Kong in 1933. Unfortunately for Harryhausen, Steiner had too many commitments, but Buttolph composed one of his more memorable and powerful scores, setting much of the tone for giant monster film music of the 1950s. Some early pre- production conceptual sketches of the Beast showed that, at one point, it was to have a shelled head and later was to have a beak.\\"Concept art from 'The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms'.\\" theseventhvoyage.com.

The film monster looks nothing like the Brontosaurus-type creature of the short story. It is instead a kind of Tyrannosaurus rex-type prehistoric predator, though quadrupedal in stature. The monster was unlike any real carnivorous dinosaur and more closely resembled a rauisuchian. A drawing of the creature was published along with the story in The Saturday Evening Post.Rovin 1989 At one point, there were plans to have the Beast snort flames, but this idea was dropped before production began due to budget restrictions. The concept, however, was used for the film poster. Later, the creature's nuclear flame breath was the inspiration for the original Japanese film Gojira (1954, Godzilla). In a scene attempting to identify the Rhedosaurus, Professor Tom Nesbitt rifles through dinosaur drawings by Charles R. Knight, a man whom Harryhausen claimed as an inspiration.Harryhausen, Ray (2010) Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life, Aurum Press Ltd The dinosaur skeleton in the museum sequence is artificial; it was obtained from RKO Pictures prop storage where it had been constructed for its classic comedy Bringing Up Baby (1938). The climactic roller coaster live-action scenes were filmed on location at the Pike in Long Beach, California and featured the Cyclone Racer entrance ramp, ticket booth, loading platform, and beach views of the structure. Split-matte, in-camera special effects by Harryhausen effectively combined the live-action of the actors and the roller coaster background footage from the Pike's parking lot with the stop-motion animation of the Beast's destroying a shooting miniature of the coaster.Hankin, Mike (2008) Ray Harryhausen-Master of the Majiks, Archive Editions LLC Release Warner Bros. acquired the film for $800,000 (including a large advertising campaign) and released it on June 13, 1953 in New York and Los Angeles.

Based on samples of his signature, John Lawrence used the surname variant \\"LeConte\\" without the space that his father used (as \\"Le Conte\\"). John Lawrence graduated from Mount Saint Mary College (now known as Mount St. Mary's University), Emmettsburg, Maryland, in 1842, and from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, in 1846. Having inherited means sufficient to render him independent, he never followed the practice of medicine to any extent. While still in medical college, in 1844, John Lawrence traveled with his cousin Joseph LeConte to the Great Lakes. Starting at Niagara Falls, they visited Detroit and Chicago and traversed Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa and Illinois before returning up the Ohio River to Pittsburgh and on to New York. John Lawrence published his first three papers on beetles that year. Travels thumb After graduating from medical college John Lawrence LeConte made several trips west, including to California via Panama in 1849. While in San Francisco, he sent 10,000 beetles preserved in alcohol back to his father. Another 20,000 beetle specimens were lost in a fire in 1852.

Christine soon learns that although the first batch is free the following shipments continue to raise in price. When the delivery man offhandedly calls her \\"missy\\", she asks him his age. He cryptically answers, \\"Don't ask.\\" Christine soon begins to spend massive amounts of money on the water to ensure their continued delivery. An unfortunate side effect of Aqua Vita is that without constant use, withdrawal results in rapid aging. When this effect becomes apparent in Shauna, Marc confronts Christine and he tells her that regardless of her age and appearance he loves her. They contemplate what to do next and he decides to drink the water himself in order to join her in old age. The episode ends with them sitting together on a park bench, aged and condemned to look old \\"for the next 30 years or so\\", nonetheless happy because they know they are going to spend these years together.

Plot Donald Knowles is a professor and joint commander of an expedition team who returns to a barren Earth 1,000 years after all life has been destroyed by an unspecified disaster. His fellow commander Jacinda Carlyle is only interested in finding whatever resources are left on the planet. Knowles has four days to explore before mining ships come to strip the planet of resources. As Knowles explores the ruins of the planet he proceeds to play an old CD player. As Chopin's Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2 begins, Knowles is confronted by ghosts of the planet. He finds them in an abandoned caf√© where they ask him not to forget their existence. Knowles pleads with Carlyle not to strip the planet but she insists upon it anyway. Knowles soon discovers that the ghosts are spirits of the forefathers who had not left the Earth when life began dissolving. They believe that humans are coming back to repopulate the planet, but Knowles explains why they are really there. He tries to get them to leave the planet, but they say they cannot leave on conventional ships because of how they warp space in a way that makes it impossible for them to survive the trip. They then plead with him not to let the others dig and destroy what remains of the planet in their search for valuable minerals. Carlyle continues to ignore him until he takes her to the caf√© to hear the voices for herself. However, they refuse to speak and Carlyle concludes that he is going insane. Later, the specters try to possess Knowles and force him to destroy the mission, but Carlyle and the other crew members stop him, believing he is doing it of his own free will. Carlyle, feeling sorry for her friend, does not report it and gives him medical leave. Knowles returns to the caf√© to confront the ghosts. They tell him he is their only hope of leaving. By channeling through him they can live although the procedure may not work. He angrily refuses and says that it was their fault the Earth was destroyed. When they claim that there is nothing else to be done, Knowles reminds them that if they were able to change the methane to oxygen to allow him to breathe without a spacesuit, surely they could change the planet into a living world again. They claim they may not be able to do so without losing their life- force in the process. He calls them cowards for not trying and without a response he returns to the ship. Suddenly, a miracle occurs: it begins raining, restoring the biosphere. The first stages of life are discovered in the oceans. Evolution is accelerated, returning Earth to a living planet once again. Knowles steps outside and--not knowing if they can hear him or not-- calls out that one day they will be back.

It is located in the Arabika Massif of the Gagra Range of the Western Caucasus, in the Gagra district of Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia. The difference in elevation of the cave's entrance and its deepest explored point is . It became the deepest-known cave in the world in 2001 when the expedition of the Ukrainian Speleological Association reached a depth of which exceeded the depth of the previous deepest-known cave, Lamprechtsofen, in the Austrian Alps, by . In 2004, for the first time in the history of speleology, the Ukrainian Speleological Association expedition reached a depth greater than , and explored the cave to . Ukrainian diver Gennadiy Samokhin extended the cave by diving in the terminal sump to 46 metres' depth in 2007 and then to 52 m in 2012, setting successive world records of 2,191 m and 2,197 m, respectively. Krubera is one of the two known caves on Earth deeper than 2,000 metres.  Naming  Alexander Kruber The original name \\"Krubera\\" had been assigned to the cave by Soviet speleologists who explored the entrance pit in 1960. This name was given after the noted Russian geographer Alexander Kruber. The name \\"Krubera Cave\\" thus has a priority. \\"Voronya Cave\\" means \\"Crows' Cave\\" in Russian. This name was used as a slang name by Kiev speleologists during the 1980s due to a number of crows nesting in the entrance pit, and then remained in the literature and media as a second name for the cave.  Location and background  Map of the Arabika Massif, showing the location of Krubera Cave and its projected resurgences The Arabika Massif, the home of Krubera (Voronya) Cave, is one of the largest high-mountain limestone karst massifs in the Western Caucasus. It is composed of Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic limestones that dip continuously southwest to the Black Sea and plunge below the modern sea level. To the northwest, north, northeast, and east, Arabika is bordered by the deeply incised canyons of Sandripsh, Kutushara, Gega and Bzyb rivers. The Bzyb River separates Arabika from the adjacent Bzybsky Massif, another outstanding karst area with many deep caves, including the Snezhnaja- Mezhonogo-Iljuzia System () and Pantjukhina Cave (). To the southwest, Arabika borders the Black Sea. The Arabika Massif has a prominent high central sector with elevations above the tree line at ~. This is an area of classical glaciokarstic landscape, with numerous glacial trough valleys and cirques, with ridges and peaks between them. The bottoms of trough valleys and karst fields lie at elevations of , and ridges and peaks rise to . The highest peak is the Peak of Speleologists () but the dominant summit is a typical pyramidal horn of the Arabika Mount (). Some middle- to low-altitude ridges covered with forest lie between the central sector and the Black Sea. A plateau-like middle-altitude outlier of the massif in its south sector is Mamzdyshkha, with part of the plateau slightly emerging above the tree line. Among several hundred caves known in the Arabika Massif, fifteen have been explored deeper than 400 m and five deeper than 1,000 m (shown in Figure 1). Krubera Cave is located at 2,256 m above sea level in the Ortobalagan Valley, a perfectly shaped, relatively shallow, glacial trough of the sub-Caucasian stretch, which holds the advanced position in the Arabika's central sector relative to the seashore. Since 1980, Ukrainian cavers have been undertaking systematic efforts in exploring deep caves in the Ortobalagan Valley, resulting in exploration of the Krubera Cave to its current depth and of the Arabikskaja System to depth of . The latter consists of Kuybushevskaya Cave (also spelled as Kujbyshevskaja; ‚àí1,110 m) and Genrikhova Bezdna Cave (‚àí965 m to the junction with Kujbyshevskaja). Another deep cave in the valley, located in its very upper part and explored by Moldavian and Ukrainian cavers is Berchilskaya Cave, deep. All large caves of the Ortobalagan Valley likely belong to a single hydrological system, connected to large springs at the Black Sea shore. The direct physical connection of Krubera Cave with the Arabikaskaja System is a sound possibility, although not yet physically realized.  Geology  Schema of caves Kruber-Voronija The Ortobalagan Valley extends along the crest of the Berchil'sky anticline, which gently plunges northwest. The cave entrances are aligned along the anticlinal crest (Figure 2) but the caves are controlled by longitudinal, transverse, and oblique fractures and faults and exhibit complex winding patterns in the plan view, remaining largely within and near the anticlinal crest zone. The caves are predominantly combinations of vadose shafts and steep meandering passages, although in places they cut apparently old fossil passages at different levels (e.g., at in Kujbyshevskaja and Krubera caves, and in the non-Kujbyshevskaja branch of Krubera Cave, etc.). The deep parts of Krubera display a more pervasive conduit pattern with a mixture of phreatic morphology, characteristic of the zone of high-gradient floods, which can be up to 400 m above the low-flow water table, and vadose downcutting elements that are observed even below the water table. The core part of the Arabika Massif is composed of the Upper Jurassic succession resting on the Bajocian Porphyritic Series, which includes sandstones, clays and conglomerates at the top, and tuff, tuffaceous sandstones, conglomerates and breccia, porphyry and lava. The Porphyritic series forms the non-karstic basement of Arabika, which is exposed only on the northern and eastern outskirts, locally in the bottoms of the Kutushara and Gega River valleys. In the central part of Arabika the Cretaceous cover (Valanginian and Hauterivian limestones, marls and sandstones) is retained only in a few ridges and peaks, but it lies intact through the low-altitude ridges to the south-west of the central part. There the Cretaceous succession includes Barremian and Aptian‚ÄìCenomanian limestones and marly limestones with abundant concretions of black chert. The Upper Jurassic succession begins with thin-bedded Kimmeridgian‚ÄìOxfordian cherty limestones, marls, sandstones and clays, which are identified in the lower part of Krubera Cave. Above lies the thick Tithonian succession of thick-bedded limestones with marly and sandy varieties. Sandy limestones are particularly abundant through the upper 1,000 m sections of deep caves of the Ortobalagan Valley. The tectonic structure of Arabika is dominated by the axis of the large sub-Caucasian anticline (oriented NW‚ÄìSE), with the gently dipping southwestern mega-flank, complicated by several low-order folds, and steeply dipping northeastern flank (Figure 3). The axis of the anticline roughly coincides with the ridge bordering the Gelgeluk Valley to the north. Located on the southwestern flank of the major anticline is another large one (Berchil'sky), in which the crest is breached by the Ortobalagan Valley. There are several smaller sub-parallel anticlines and synclines farther southwest, between the Berchil' Ridge and the coast. The plicative dislocation structure of the massif is severely complicated by faults, with the fault-block structure strongly controlling both cave development and groundwater flow. Major faults of the sub-Caucasian orientation delineate several large elongated blocks that experienced uplift with different rates during Pliocene and Pleistocene. This had a pronounced effect on the development of deep groundwater circulation and of Krubera Cave in particular. Both longitudinal and transverse faults and related fracture zones play a role in guiding groundwater flow; the latter guide flow across the strike of major plicative dislocations, from the central sector toward the Black Sea.  Hydrogeology  Major on-shore karst springs with individual average discharges of are located at altitudes ranging from (Reprua Spring) to (Gega waterfall). Two of them are located in the shore area; these are Reprua (average discharge ; altitude above sea level) and Kholodnaja Rechka (; a.s.l.). Two more major springs are located in the river canyons bordering Arabika to the east: Goluboe Ozero in the Bzyb canyon (; a.s.l.) and Gega waterfall in the Gega canyon (; a.s.l.). There are also several smaller springs in the Gagra town. The Reprua River, one of the shortest rivers in the world, about 60 ft long, starts in the cave and flows toward the Black Sea. Some boreholes located along the shore of the Black Sea yield karstic groundwater from depths of 40‚Äì280 m below sea level. Other much deeper boreholes tapped low-salinity karstic waters at depths of 500 and 1,750 m in the Khashupse Valley near Gantiadi and 2,250 m near Gagra.Meliva et al., 1969 This suggests the existence of a deep karst system and vigorous karst groundwater circulation at depth. Submarine springs are known in the Arabika area, emerging from the floor of the Black Sea in front of the massif. Shallow springs at depths of 5‚Äì7 m can be reached by free dive near Gantiadi. Tamaz Kiknadze (1979) reported submarine springs near the eastern part of Gagra at depth of 25‚Äì30 m and Buachidze and Meliva (1967) revealed submarine discharge at depths up to ‚àí400 m by hydrochemical profiling. Recently an outstanding feature of the sea floor topography near Arabika has been revealed from a digital bathymetric map that combines depth soundings and high-resolution marine gravity data. This is a huge submarine depression in front of the Zhovekvara River mouth, which has dimensions of about 5 x 9 km and a maximum depth of about . The Arabika Submarine Depression is a closed feature with internal vertical relief of about (measured from its lowest rim) separated from the abyssal slope by the bar at a depth of about . It has steep northern and northeastern slopes (on the side of the massif) and gentle south and southwestern slopes. Its formation is apparently karstic. Presently this depression seems to be a focus of submarine discharge of the karst systems of Arabika. The speleological explorations and a series of dye tracing experiments conducted during the 1980s under the coordination of Alexander Klimchouk have radically changed previous notions of the hydrogeology of Arabika, revealed its outstanding speleological perspectives and strongly stimulated further efforts for exploration of deep caves. Tracers injected in the Kujbyshevskaja Cave and the Iljukhina System were detected in the Kholodnaja Rechka and Reprua springs, proving groundwater flow to the south- southwest across major tectonic structures over a distance of 13‚Äì16 km as the crow flies (Figure 1). The tracer from Kujbyshevskaja Cave was also detected in a borehole located between these two springs, which yields groundwater from a depth of below sea level. This has been interpreted as an indication of the connection of the cave with the submarine discharge. The large \\"Central Karst Hydrologic System\\", which encompasses most of the southeastern flank of the Arabika anticline, had been identified in this way. The system became the deepest in the world with its overall vertical range of about (measuring to the borehole water-bearing horizon) or even (measuring to the deepest reported submarine discharge points). Another tracer was injected in the Moskovskaja Cave (‚àí970 m) and detected at the Gegsky Vodopad spring, indicating the presence of a karst hydrologic system comprising the northeastern flank of the Arabika anticline (the \\"Northern System\\"). No connections have been revealed with yet another major spring, Goluboje Ozero in the Bzyb River canyon, although it apparently drains a large area of the eastern sector of the massif (the hypothetical \\"Eastern Karst Hydrological System\\"). It is not clear where Sarma Cave (‚àí1,550 m) drains to, Goluboje Ozero to the southeast or Reprua to the southwest, at the shore. The results of the dye-tracing tests demonstrated that groundwater flow is not subordinate to the fold structure but is largely controlled by faults that cut across the strike of major folds, and that the large part of the central sector of Arabika is hydraulically connected to the springs along the seashore and with submarine discharge points. Krubera Cave has an extremely steep profile and reveals a huge thickness of the vadose zone. The lower boundary of the vadose zone (the top of the phreatic zone) is at an elevation of about at low flow, which suggests a low overall hydraulic gradient of 0.007-0.008. Low-TDS groundwater is tapped by boreholes in the shore area at depths of 40‚Äì280, 500, 1,750, and 2,250 m below sea level, which suggests the existence of a deep flow system with vigorous flow. Submarine discharge along the Arabika coast is reported at depths up to ~400 m b.s.l. It is difficult to interpret these facts in terms of the development of karst systems controlled by contemporary sea level, or within the range of its Pleistocene fluctuations (up to ‚àí150 m). In combination with the existence of the Arabika Submarine Depression, all these facts point to the possibility that karst systems in Arabika could have originated in response to the Messinian salinity crisis (5.96‚Äì5.33 Ma) when the Black Sea (Eastern Paratethys) could have almost dried up, as did the adjacent Mediterranean, where the dramatic sea level drop of ~1,500 m is well established.  Biology  Plutomurus ortobalaganensis. The biocenosis of Krubera-Voronja is composed of more than 12 species of arthropods of several groups, such as pseudoscorpions, spiders, opiliones, crustaceans, springtails, beetles and dipterans. Krubera-Voronja cave is inhabited by endemic species, including four springtails discovered during the CAVEX Team expedition of 2010: Anurida stereoodorata, Deuteraphorura kruberaensis, Schaefferia profundissima, and Plutomurus ortobalaganensis; the last of these is the deepest terrestrial animal ever found on Earth, living below the cave entrance. The beetle Catops cavicis inhabits Krubera-Voronja cave and also several caves around the Ortobalagan valley. The subterranean amphipod crustacean Kruberia abchasica caught by Gennady Samokhin in August 2013, during dives in the siphon 'Dva Kapitana', dwells at the deepest part of the Krubera Cave (at the depth of -2,175 metres).  History of exploration  = Early exploration = At the beginning of the 20th century, Arabika was visited by French speleologist √âdouard-Alfred Martel, who published several works about the massif. In 1909‚Äì10 Russian karst scientist Alexander Kruber, a founder of the study in Russia, performed some field studies in Arabika. He published his observations in a series of Arabika-specific papers and several monographs. During the subsequent 50 years no special studies were undertaken of the karst and caves in the region, although the karst of Arabika was referred to in many works dealing with regional geology and hydrogeology. = 1960s = In the early 1960s, Georgian geographer led by Levan Maruashvili began exploring caves in the high sector of the massif. Among several other caves, they made the first exploration of an open-mouthed 60 m shaft in the Ortobalagan Valley and named it after Alexander Kruber. The first explorers were stopped by impassable squeezes at ‚àí95 m in a meandering passage which led off from the foot of the entrance shaft. The cave remained largely neglected over the next 20 years, although occasionally visited by cavers from various caving clubs. Before 1980 there were no caves deeper than known in Arabika. = 1980s = The new epoch in cave explorations in the Arabika Massif began in 1980 when the Kiev Speleological Club, led by Alexander Klimchuk, started exploring caves there. They adopted an approach to cave search and exploration which included thorough investigations in a defined area and systematic testing of cave limits, through digging in boulder chokes and enlarging squeezes which had previously obstructed exploration. The Ortobalagan Valley had been selected as a primary focus for the Ukrainian efforts. This approach, followed in subsequent years by other caving clubs which joined exploration activity in different parts of Arabika, resulted in the discovery of many deep caves including five caves deeper than 1,000 m. In the Ortobalagan Valley, the Ukrainian cavers made breakthroughs in Kuybyshevskaya Cave at ‚àí160 m and pushed it to by 1986 through a series of massive boulder chokes. They broke through an impassable squeeze at ‚àí120 m in Genrikhova Bezdna Cave and eventually connected it to Kuybyshevskaya at ‚àí956 m in 1987. The resultant system has been named the Arabikskaya System. From 1982 onwards, the Kiev cavers started systematically working in Krubera Cave, located less than 200 metres from the Kuybyshevskaya entrance, hoping to connect with the Arabikskaya System and increase its total depth by 60 m. Exploration progressed slowly because critically tight meanders between the pits required enormous amounts of work to widen them to a passable size. The cave was pushed to ‚àí340 m during 1982‚Äì1987. Two \\"windows\\" in a vertical shaft at depths of 220‚Äì250 m were documented on the cave map but remained unexplored. During this time the cave received its second, alternative name (Crows') Cave, owing to the number of crows nesting in the entrance shaft. = 1990s‚Äìearly 2000s = The political and ethnic conflict in Abkhazia during 1992‚Äì94 resulted in instability and border problems which continued over subsequent years. This suspended speleological explorations in Arabika. Some stabilization of the situation in 1998 has since enabled a renewal of exploration effort to take place in the region. In 1999, the expedition of the Ukrainian Speleological Associations (Ukr. S.A.) led by Yury Kasyan made a major breakthrough in Krubera Cave by discovering and exploring two branches behind the windows at a depth of 220‚Äì250 m. These branches stretched in two different directions. The \\"Main Branch\\" was explored to ‚àí740 m and the \\"Nekuybyshevskaya Branch\\" to ‚àí500 m. In 2000, the Main Branch was quickly pushed by the multi-stage expedition of the Ukr. S.A. in August to ‚àí1,200 m and in September to ‚àí1,410 m. In January 2001, the Ukr.S.A. expedition explored the cave to making it the deepest cave in the world. For the first time in the history of speleology, the deepest cave in the world had been established outside of western Europe. Since 2001, the Krubera explorations by the Ukr.S.A. have been undertaken within the frame of the multi-year project named \\"The Call of the Abyss\\", coordinated by A. Klimchuk, Y. Kasyan, G. Samokhin and K. Markovskoy. Besides the Ukrainian speleologists, cavers from many countries such as France, Spain, Russia, Moldova, Bulgaria, United Kingdom, Ireland, Israel and Lithuania have taken part in different expeditions of the Ukr.S.A. = 2001 onwards = The major events in the exploration of Krubera Cave in subsequent years were as follows (see Figure 4 for spot locations):  2001  * August: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Yury Kasyan. Four underground camps established in the cave: in the Main Branch at ‚àí500, ‚àí1,200 and ‚àí1,400 m and in the Nekujbyshevskaja Branch at ‚àí500 m. Systematic inspection and probing of potential leads in the deep sections of the Main Branch; climbing in the Lamprechtsofen tributary; digging in the boulder choke in the Nekuybyshevskaya Branch.  2003  * August: the expedition of the Kiev Speleological Club and the CAVEX team. Tested and passed a sump at ‚àí1,440 m (now known as Sump 1), explored the post-sump section to roughly ‚àí1,660 m, continued climbing in the Lamprechtsofen tributary.  2004  * July: the CAVEX team started their separate explorations, beyond the Ukr.S.A. project, in Krubera Cave. Continued exploring a section beyond Sump 1 at ‚àí1,410 m and reached the next sump (Sump 2 ‚Äì \\"Blue Lake\\") at depth claimed to be ‚àí1,840 m. The depth of that point according to the subsequent Ukr.S.A. survey is ‚àí1,775 m. * August: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Nikolay Solovyov and Alexander Klimchuk. In the Main Branch, surveyed the post-sump series, established a camp at ‚àí1,640 m, discovered a lead to a new section (\\"The Way to the Dream\\") and explored to ‚àí1,840 m. Explored the Uzhgorodskaya Series in the upper part of Krubera by climbing an 80 m high shaft in the Meander Krym. Continued working in the Nekuybyshevskaya Branch. * October: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Yury Kasyan. In the Main Branch, discovered a lead into a new section beyond the Big Junction at ‚àí1,790 m. Explored this section named \\"Windows\\" to a blind chamber called \\"Game Over\\" at ‚àí2,080 m. The depth mark of 2,000 m had been passed for the first time in the history of speleology.  2005  * February‚ÄìMarch: the Ukr. S.A. expedition led by Yury Kasyan. In the Main Branch, continued exploring the \\"Windows\\" series where many side leads and several sumps were tested. A sump at ‚àí1,980 m called \\"Kvitochka\\" was passed by Nikolay Solovyov, and a continuation found behind it. * July: the CAVEX team expedition. Explored the section beyond the Kvitochka Sump to a further sump called Dva Kapitana (\\"Two Captains\\") at ‚àí2,140 m. * August: the Ukr. S.A. expedition led by Nikolay Solovyov. Continued digging and broke through the boulder choke at ‚àí500 m in the Nekuybyshevskaya Branch, explored it to the next boulder choke at ‚àí640 m. * October: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Yury Kasyan. The exploration beyond the Kvitochka Sump had been cancelled due to a sudden flood. Established a camp at ‚àí1,960 m. Performed a verification survey to ‚àí1,200 m by hydrolevelling to assess the precision of the standard Ukr.S.A. survey (the Russian Geographic Society group). Continued climbing in the Lamprechtsofen tributary to +210 m relative to the junction.  2006  * August‚ÄìSeptember: the Ukr.S.A. expedition coordinated by Yury Kasyan. In the Main Branch the terminal sump called Dva Kapitana (\\"Two Captains\\") was tested by Gennadiy Samokhin to depth of 17 m, which extended the total depth of Krubera Cave to . In the Nekuybyshevskaya Branch, a group led by Kyryl Markovskoy broke through the boulder choke at ‚àí640 m and explored a continuation to ‚àí1,004 m.  2007  * January: the CAVEX team expedition. Performed a dive in the terminal \\"Dva Kapitana\\" sump and claimed it to reach ‚àí30 m depth below the water table. However, characteristics of morphology of the underwater passage reported by the team were not confirmed by the subsequent exploration, and no safety line was found deeper than 16 m. * August‚ÄìSeptember: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Yury Kasyan. In the Main Branch, Gennadiy Samokhin dived the terminal \\"Dva Kapitana\\" Sump for a length of 140 m and depth of ‚àí46 m, which set the new depth for Krubera Cave at . After an elbow at -35 m the underwater passage continues to depth under steep angle. Also in the deep parts of the Main Branch, several side passages and sumps at various depths were explored. In a side branch which previously ended at ‚àí1,775 m by the \\"Blue Lake\\" sump, a series of air-filled passages was explored behind the sump, separated by six intermediary sumps. The farthest sump, \\"Yantarny\\", was explored for 130 m in length and 19.5 m in depth and continues. The deepest point in this branch has been reached at ‚àí1,841 m. In the Nekuybyshevskaya Branch, a group led by Kyryl Markovskoy continued exploring new leads and extended the depth of this branch to ‚àí1,293 m.  2008  * September: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Yury Kasyan. Explored the Nekuybyshevskaya Branch to depth of . An international scientific expedition \\"Towards the Centre of the Earth\\", led by Lithuanian Aidas Gudaitis (Aenigma), descended the main branch as far as , placing water level loggers at siphons here and in the \\"Chamber of Soviet Speleologists\\" at .  2009  * August‚ÄìSeptember: the Ukr.S.A. expedition led by Yury Kasyan further pushed the Nekuybushevskaya Branch to a siphon at depth of . The international \\"Towards the Centre of the Earth\\" expedition led by Aidas Gudaitis returned to the main branch to collect data from water level loggers, swap their locations and push exploration in the \\"Spanish branch\\" near camp 1400. 2008‚Äì2009 data collected from 1,710 m and 1,800 m indicated that the sump levels rose in two distinct periods: continuously from May‚ÄìJuly 2009 and with an isolated pulse in October 2008, both sumps reaching a maximum flood depth of 12 m. New logger locations at depths of 1,800 m, 1,980 m (Kvitochka sump) and 2,140 m (Dva Kapitana's sump).  2010  * July‚ÄìAugust: The CAVEX Team Summer expedition led by Konstantin Mujin performed the first biospeleological studies in the Krubera-Voronya cave. The biospeleological studies led by the cave biologists Ana Sofia Reboleira and Alberto Sendra, provided the deepest subterranean arthropods of the Earth. * August: During \\"Towards the Centre of the Earth\\" expedition led by Aidas Gudaitis, a Lithuanian member of Aenigma caving club Saulƒó Pankienƒó became the first woman to dive Kvitochka sump at 1,980 m, and subsequently to descend to the \\"Two Captains\\" sump at a depth of . Water level measurement results of 2009‚Äì2010, collected during this expedition, showed that the water level rose up to above the sump \\"Two Captains\\" during June 2010. Data logging devices were installed by Irish members of the expedition near to the entrance of the cave, to log surface conditions and enable correlation of data between surface and underground locations. \\"Spanish Branch\\" exploration was completed and a limit was reached with 131 m total passage surveyed.  2012  * August: A team of 59 spent 27 days exploring Krubera. Including members from nine different countries, the team set up a series of camps underground. Ukrainian cave diver Gennady Samokhin was responsible for reaching a new world depth record of .

Application developers use MXML in combination with ActionScript to develop rich Internet applications, with products such as Apache Flex. Adobe Systems, which acquired Macromedia in December 2005, gives no official meaning for the acronym MXML. Some developers suggest it should stand for \\"Magic eXtensible Markup Language\\" (which is a backronym). It is likely that the name comes from the MX suffix given to Macromedia Studio products released in 2002 and 2004, or simply \\"Macromedia eXtensible Markup Language\\". MXML is used mainly to declaratively lay out the interface of applications and can also be used to implement business logic and internet application behaviors. It can contain chunks of ActionScript code, either when creating the body of an event handler function, or with data binding where the curly braces ({) syntax is used. MXML is often used with Flex Server, which dynamically compiles it into standard binary SWF files. However, the Adobe Flash Builder IDE (formerly Adobe Flex Builder) and free Flex SDK can also compile MXML into SWF files without the use of a Flex Server. There is also a PHP PEAR package called XML_MXML, which is a framework to build Adobe Flex applications. MXML is considered a proprietary standard due to its tight integration with Adobe technologies. It is like XAML in this respect. No published translators exist for converting an MXML document to another user interface language such as UIML, XUL, XForms, XAML, or SVG.

He was born into a family of the equestrian order, as the son of a wealthy landowner in Arpinum, some south-east of Rome.  Biography  Cicero's well-to-do father arranged for him to be educated with his brother in Rome, Athens and probably Rhodes in 79-77 BC.Haskell: H.J.: This Was Cicero (1964) p.83 Around 70 BC he married Pomponia (sister of his brother's friend Atticus), a dominant woman of strong personality.Everitt, Anthony: Cicero, A Turbulent Life p.xv (2001) He divorced her after a long disharmonious marriage with much bickering between the spouses in late 45 BC.Haskell,H.J.: This was Cicero (1964) p.83 His brother, Marcus, tried several times to reconcile the spouses, but to no avail.Marcus Tullius Cicero: Samtliga brev, collected letters translated into Swedish by Gabriel Sj√∂gren (1963) The couple had a son born in 66 BC and named Quintus Tullius Cicero after his father. Quintus was Aedile in 66 BC, Praetor in 62 BC, and Propraetor of the Province of Asia for three years 61-59 BC.Rawson, E.: Cicero (1975) p.338 Under Caesar, during the Gallic Wars, he was legatus (accompanying Caesar on his second expedition to Britain in 54 BC and surviving a Nervian siege of his camp during Ambiorix's revolt), and was under his brother when the latter was governor in Cilicia in 51 BC. During the civil wars he supported the Pompeian faction, obtaining the pardon of Caesar later. During the Second Triumvirate, when the Roman Republic was again in civil war, Quintus, his son, and his brother, were all proscribed. He fled from Tusculum with his brother. Later Quintus went home to bring back money for travelling expenses. His son, Quintus minor, hid his father, and did not reveal the hiding place although he was tortured. When Quintus heard this, he gave himself up to try and save his son; however, both father and son, and his famous brother, were all killed in 43 BC, as proscribed persons.Rawson: Cicero (1975) p. 294Everitt, A.: Cicero, a Turbulent Life (2001) p. 306-307 Personality and relationship with brother Marcus Quintus is depicted by Caesar as a brave soldier and an inspiring military leader. At a critical moment in the Gallic Wars he rallied his legion and retrieved an apparently hopeless position. Caesar commended him for this with the words \\"He praised Cicero and his men very highly, as they deserved\\".Bello Gallico 5.52 However, later the legate was purportedly responsible for a near-disaster in Gaul but does not receive condemnation from Caesar as a result.Bello Gallico 6.36 Quintus had an impulsive temperament and had fits of cruelty during military operations, a behaviour frowned on by Romans of that time. The Roman (and Stoic) ideal was to control one‚Äôs emotions even in battle. Quintus Cicero also liked old-fashioned and harsh punishments, like putting a person convicted of patricide into a sack and throwing him into the sea (traditionally such a felon was severely scourged, then sewn into a stout leather bag with a dog, a snake, a rooster, and a monkey, and the bag was subsequently thrown into a river).Kinsey, Cicero's Speech for Roscius of Ameria This punishment he meted out during his propraetorship of Asia.Rawson, E. Cicero (1975) p.99 (For the Romans, both patricide and matricide were one of the worst crimes.) His brother confesses in one of his letters to his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus (written in 51 BC while he was Proconsul of Cilicia and had taken Quintus as legatus with him) that he dares not leave Quintus alone as he is afraid of what kind of sudden ideas he might have.Marcus Tullius Cicero: Samtliga brev, Collected letters, translated by Gabriel Sj√∂gren (1963) On the positive side, Quintus was utterly honest, even as a governor of a province, in which situation many Romans shamelessly amassed private property for themselves. He was also a well-educated man who enjoyed reading Greek tragedies, and even wrote some tragedies himself. The relationship between the brothers was mostly affectionate, except for a period of serious disagreement during Caesar‚Äôs dictatorship 49-44 BC.Everitt, Anthony: Cicero, A Turbulent Life (2001) p.213 The many letters from Marcus ad Quintum fratrem show how deep and affectionate the brothers‚Äô relationship was, though Marcus Cicero often played the role of the \\"older and more experienced\\" sibling, lecturing to his brother on what the right thing to do was. Quintus might also have felt at times that the self- centred Marcus thought only about how his brother might hinder or help Marcus‚Äô own career on the cursus honorum.Rawson, E.: Cicero (1975) p.100 Authorship As an author, during the Gallic wars, he wrote four tragedies in the Greek style. Three of them were titled Troas, Erigones, and Electra, but all are lost. He also wrote several poems on the second expedition of Caesar to Britannia, three epistles to Tiro (extant) and a fourth one to his brother. The long letter Commentariolum Petitionis (Little handbook on electioneering) has also survived. Although its authenticity has been much questioned, recently the scholar Andrew Lintott has argued that Quintus was the true author. Lintott, A. Cicero as Evidence: A Historian's Companion (2006) p.131 It is in any case a guide to political behavior in Cicero‚Äôs time.

It compares grammatical processes that are in frequent use to less frequently used ones that tend towards lexicalization. Generally the test of productivity concerns identifying which grammatical forms would be used in the coining of new words: these will tend to only be converted to other forms using productive processes. Examples in English In standard English, the formation of preterite and past participle forms of verbs by means of ablaut (as Germanic strong verbs, for example, sing-sang-sung) is no longer considered productive. Newly coined verbs in English overwhelmingly use the 'weak' (regular) ending -ed for the past tense and past participle (for example, spammed, e-mailed). Similarly, the only clearly productive plural ending is -(e)s; it is found on the vast majority of English count nouns and is used to form the plurals of neologisms, such as FAQs and Muggles. The ending -en, on the other hand, is no longer productive, being found only in oxen, children, and the now-rare brethren (as a plural of brother). Because these old forms can sound incorrect to modern ears, regularization can wear away at them until they are no longer used: brethren has now been replaced with the more regular-sounding brothers except when talking about religious orders. It appears that many strong verbs were completely lost during the transition from Old English to Middle English, possibly because they sounded archaic or were simply no longer truly understood. In both cases, however, occasional exceptions have occurred. A false analogy with other verbs caused dug to become thought of as the 'correct' preterite and past participle form of dig (the conservative King James Bible preferred digged in 1611) and more recent examples, like snuck from sneak and dove from dive, have similarly become popular. Some American English dialects also use the non-standard drug as the past tense of drag. Significance Since use to produce novel (new, non-established) structures is the clearest proof of usage of a grammatical process, the evidence most often appealed to as establishing productivity is the appearance of novel forms of the type the process leads one to expect, and many people would limit the definition offered above to exclude use of a grammatical process that does not result in a novel structure. Thus in practice, and, for many, in theory, productivity is the degree to which native speakers use a particular grammatical process for the formation of novel structures. A productive grammatical process defines an open class, one which admits new words or forms. Non-productive grammatical processes may be seen as operative within closed classes: they remain within the language and may include very common words, but are not added to and may be lost in time or through regularization converting them into what now seems to be a correct form. Productivity is, as stated above and implied in the examples already discussed, a matter of degree, and there are a number of areas in which that may be shown to be true. As the example of -en becoming productive shows, what has apparently been non- productive for many decades or even centuries may suddenly come to some degree of productive life, and it may do so in certain dialects or sociolects while not in others, or in certain parts of the vocabulary but not others. Some patterns are only very rarely productive, others may be used by a typical native speaker several times a year or month, whereas others (especially syntactic processes) may be used productively dozens or hundreds of times in a typical day. It is not atypical for more than one pattern with similar functions to be comparably productive, to the point that a speaker can be in a quandary as to which form to use ‚Äîe.g., would it be better to say that a taste or color like that of raisins is raisinish, raisiny, raisinlike, or even raisinly? It can also be very difficult to assess when a given usage is productive or when a person is using a form that has already been learned as a whole. Suppose a reader comes across an unknown word such as despisement meaning \\"an attitude of despising\\". The reader may apply the verb+ment noun- formational process to understand the word perfectly well, and this would be a kind of productive use. This would be essentially independent of whether or not the writer had also used the same process productively in coining the term, or whether he or she had learned the form from previous usage (as most English speakers have learned government, for instance), and no longer needed to apply the process productively in order to use the word. Similarly a speaker or writer's use of words like raisinish or raisiny may or may not involve productive application of the noun+ish and noun+y rules, and the same is true of a hearer or reader's understanding of them. But it will not necessarily be at all clear to an outside observer, or even to the speaker and hearer themselves, whether the form was already learnt and whether the rules were applied or not. English and productive forms Developments over the last five hundred years or more have meant English has developed in ways very different from the evolution of most world languages across history. English is a language with a long written past that has preserved many words that might otherwise have been lost or changed, often in fixed texts such as the King James Version of the Bible which are not updated regularly to modernise their language. English also has many conventions for writing polite and formal prose, which are often very different from how people normally speak. As literacy among native English speakers has become almost universal, it has become increasingly easy for people to bring back into life archaic words and grammar forms, often to create a comic or humorously old-fashioned effect, with the expectation that these new coinings will be understandable. These processes would be much rarer for languages without a culture of literacy. English has also borrowed extensively from other languages because of technology and trade, often borrowing plural forms as well as singular ones into standard English. For example, the plural of radius (from Latin) has not decisively settled between radiuses and the original Latin radii, though educated opinion prefers the latter. In some cases, new words have been coined from these bases (often Latin) on the same rules. Examples in other languages One study, which focuses on the usage of the Dutch suffix -heid (comparable to -ness in English) hypothesizes that -heid gives rise to two kinds of abstract nouns: those referring to concepts and those referring to states of affairs. It shows that the referential function of -heid is typical for the lowest-frequency words, while its conceptual function is typical for the highest-frequency words. It claims that high-frequency formations with the suffix -heid are available in the mental lexicon, whereas low-frequency words and neologisms are produced and understood by rule.BAAYEN, R. & NEIJT, A.

Despite losing in qualifying competitions at different countries, Ali became the only Iraqi to qualify for the 2004 Olympic Games, earning a wild-card spot because of his sportsmanship, among other things. After securing their Olympic spot, Ali and Watkins moved to New York, where they began to train at the legendary Gleason's Gym. Their story was subsequently shown at many United States outlets, including CNN. Ali hoped to become Iraq's first Olympic boxing medalist, the second one overall, and the first Iraqi to earn a medal since a wrestler earned a Bronze medal at the 1960 Rome Olympics.

However, he failed to deliver on his promise in a declining Sri Lankan team (prior to the revival of Sri Lankan cricket at the 1996 World Cup). Once in the national side, he sometimes threw his wicket away due to poor shot-selection and was suspect to the swinging delivery.

It is not to be confused with the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church. History Blessed Josif Papamihali (1912 ‚Äì 1948) The conversion to Christianity of Albania took place under Latin influence in the north, under Greek in the south, and Christianity was the first and the oldest monotheistic religion of Albanian people. After the fifteenth-century Ottoman conquest, some two thirds of the population accepted Islam. In 1967, Communist-ruled Albania was officially declared an atheist state. Though the Greek liturgical rite was used in many of its churches, Albania was part of the patriarchate of Rome until 731, when Byzantine Emperor Leo III, in reprisal for the opposition of Pope Gregory III to the emperor's iconoclast policy, attached the whole of Eastern Illyricum to the patriarchate of Constantinople. Catholics of the Roman Rite were long established in the north of the country. A Catholic mission worked in the south between 1660, when the Orthodox archbishop joined the Catholic Church, to 1765 when the effort was abandoned because of obstacles placed by the Ottoman rulers. In 1895 a group of villages in Mali Shpati, southeast of Elbasan in central Albania, decided to become Catholic and demanded a bishop of their own rite, a proposal to which the consular representatives of Russia and Montenegro raised objections with the civil authorities. At about the same time, another group of Greek-Catholics arose, centred on an archimandrite, George Germanos, who was a nephew of the Orthodox metropolitan in 1900, and concluded a definitive movement of Catholic unity formed in Elbasan. Numbers grew only to a small extent, but enough for southern Albania to become in 1939 a separate ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the care of an Apostolic Administrator. However, after less than seven years, the administrator was expelled, and contact seemed lost with the Byzantine faithful, who found themselves under strict Communist rule. Only in 1992 was it possible to appoint a new apostolic administrator. At first the post was given to the Holy See's diplomatic representative in Tirana, Archbishop Ivan Dias, who later became Archbishop of Mumbai and a cardinal. Archbishop Dias's successor as Apostolic Administrator of Southern Albania, not as Nuncio, is the Croatian- born Byzantine-Rite Franciscan bishop Hil Kabashi, who was appointed in 1996. The apostolic administratorship of Southern Albania has 3,200 Catholics in nine parishes, with 11 churches, and is served by four diocesan and 10 religious priests, 10 male and 97 female religious, who administer 10 schools and 20 charitable institutions. The great majority of these are of the Roman Rite.

He captained the Sri Lankan 2014 T20 World Cup winning side. He is a right-arm fast bowler that is commonly used as a specialist death bowler, and is well known for his distinctive round-arm action, sometimes referred to as a sling action, which leads to his nicknames, 'Slinga Malinga'. Considered as one of the greatest limited-overs bowlers of all time, Malinga's unorthodox action and dipping slower ball yorkers are credited with much of his success. He is best known for his ability to take consecutive wickets, with in-swinging yorkers: he is the only bowler in the world to have two World Cup hat-tricks, the only bowler to have taken three hat-tricks in ODIs and the only player to have taken four wickets in four consecutive balls in any form of international cricket, which he has done twice. On 22 April 2011, he announced his retirement from Test cricket. He has been named as the official event ambassador for the World Twenty20 Championships by ICC. On 26 July 2019, he retired from One Day International cricket after the first ODI against Bangladesh. In September 2019, during the series against New Zealand, Malinga became the first bowler to take 100 wickets in Twenty20 International cricket. Malinga took a hat- trick to become the first bowler to claim two T20I hat-tricks, and four wickets with four balls, in the third over of his spell, while becoming the second bowler in the world to take four wickets in four consecutive balls in T20I history after Rashid Khan during the process. He was the first bowler to take four wickets in four consecutive balls twice in international cricket, after previously doing so against South Africa in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. He also became the first bowler to take five hat-tricks across all formats of international cricket and thus holds the record for producing most number of hat-tricks in international cricket. Early years Malinga grew up in modest circumstances in Rathgama, a coastal village situated 12 km northwest of Galle. He often played cricket with friends on the sand banks and coconut groves by a river in his cricket-obsessed village. His father Separamadu Milton, is a retired bus mechanic who worked out of the Galle depot. He had his education at three schools, namely Mahinda College, Galle, Vidyaloka College, Galle and Vidyathilake Vidyalaya, Thiranagama. Malinga had his primary education at Vidyathilake Vidyalaya in Thiranagama, a school situated near by his village.He married Tanya Perera in 2010. After passing the grade 5 Scholarship Examination in 1993, he entered Vidyaloka College, Galle for his secondary education, where he started his cricket career. Here Malinga was discovered by former Sri Lankan paceman Champaka Ramanayake. Champaka, so impressed by Malinga's raw ability, invited him to join the Galle Cricket Club. Champaka also helped him to join the first XI cricket team of Mahinda College, Galle. Joining Mahinda College was the turning point of his cricket career and he was helped by some of its distinguished Old boys. A short-lived attempt to make Malinga's action more upright led to much reduced pace and failing accuracy. Malinga promptly returned to his natural action with success, and with great encouragement from Ramanayake. Style Malinga bowling against Pakistan in the final of the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 at Lord's Malinga's action has attracted great comment. The cricket reference text Wisden has noted that Malinga's delivery action is similar to \\"slinging\\", resulting to his nickname \\"Slinga Malinga\\". Malinga has said that his unique round-arm bowling action was a result of learning to play cricket exclusively with a tennis ball. Typically, younger bowlers are encouraged to deliver the ball with their arm near vertical to remove or reduce direction variables. Sir Viv Richards admired Lasith Malinga's impressive bowling during the 2007 Cricket World Cup which was held in the Caribbean, saying that Lasith Malinga is the best thing that happened to Sri Lankan cricket after Aravinda de Silva.

He burst onto the test scene after ripping through the New Zealand top order, helping Sri Lanka draw the test series on their 2006/07 tour of New Zealand.

In 2019 he was again bought by the Mumbai Indians. In May 2018, he was named as one of the ten marquee players for the first edition of the Global T20 Canada cricket tournament. On 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Montreal Tigers in the players' draft for the inaugural edition of the tournament. He was the leading wicket-taker in the tournament for the Montreal Tigers, with thirteen dismissals in six matches. In December 2018, he was re- bought by the Mumbai Indians in the player auction for the 2019 Indian Premier League. On 22 March 2019, he has ruled himself out of at least the first six IPL matches for Mumbai Indians in 2019. This was due to the fact that in order to qualify for the Sri Lanka World Cup squad, where Sri Lanka's selectors told him that he must play in the forthcoming Super Provincial One Day domestic tournament to get qualify for the World Cup. However, on 25 March 2019, SLC soften the decision and make him available for the IPL 2019. The decision was taken after BCCI asked Sri Lanka Cricket to make Malinga available for as much of the tournament as possible. He returned to Sri Lanka to feature in the Super Provincial One-Day Tournament before rejoining Mumbai after April 10. Malinga was available for Mumbai Indians through the entirety of April. He contributed to the fourth title win for Mumbai Indians with a wicket on the last ball in the final where 2 runs where required thus giving Mumbai a win by 1 run. Records * Only bowler to take two four wicket hauls in consecutive balls in international cricket (v. South Africa March 2007 and New Zealand 2019). * First bowler to take 100 T20I wickets. * The first and, to date, only bowler to take three hat-tricks in One-Day International cricket. * Highest ninth wicket partnership in an ODI: 132 runs with Angelo Matthews against Australia in 2010. Coaching career In February 2018, he was appointed as the bowling mentor for the Mumbai Indians team though Shane Bond serves as the bowling coach for the side in 2018 IPL season. Mumbai Indians franchise revealed that Malinga would provide supportive role as a mentor and would be part of the coaching staff ahead of the 2018 IPL season. Prior to the decision made by the Mumbai Indians, Malinga was released from the Mumbai Indians team for the 2018 IPL auction due to his poor bowling performances at the 2017 IPL season.

A right-handed batsman, he represented Australia in three Test matches between 1877 and 1879. At the domestic level, he played for the New South Wales cricket team. Later, he became an umpire. He is most famous for facing the first ball ever bowled in Test cricket, scoring the first run in Test cricket and making the first Test century. This innings of 165 remains the highest individual share of a completed team innings in Test cricket history, despite more than 2,000 Test matches being played since that first Test. Ironically in another first, he was forced to retire hurt; when a ball broke his finger. Early life Bannerman was born in Woolwich, Kent, England to William Bannerman and his wife Margaret. Not long afterwards the family migrated to New South Wales, Australia, where he joined the Warwick Cricket Club in Sydney. At the club he was trained by William Caffyn, a former Surrey cricketer who was then a representative of New South Wales. Bannerman started playing professional cricket in 1871, before making his first-class debut for New South Wales. In his first match, against Victoria, he made 32 and 3 runs. Test matches Bannerman faced the first ball in Test cricket and scored the first Test century Bannerman played in the first three matches that were later designated as Test matches. The first of these, between Australia and England was held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in March 1877 and Australia batted first. Bannerman opened the Australian innings and is thus retrospectively deemed to have had the honour of facing the first ball ever bowled in Test cricket (the bowler being England's Alfred Shaw) and scoring the first ever run in Test cricket. Dropped before he reached double figures, he went on to score 126 on the first day and then added 39 on the second day to reach 165 when he was forced to retire hurt, his finger having been broken by a ball from George Ulyett. Only Harry Jupp (England) scoring 54 on the second day bettered Charles Bannerman's 39 runs on the second day. Again retrospectively, his innings was the first-ever Test century. It remains the highest score by an Australian batsman on debut and his 165 runs, out of Australia's total of 245, is still the highest proportion (67.35%) of a completed innings in a Test match. No other Australian exceeded 20 in either innings, as Australia won the match by 45 runs. For his feat, spectators at the match collected ¬£83 7s 6d to present to him. Bannerman played in two more matches now recognised as Tests, the second in 1877 and the one in 1879. His Test record is 239 runs at an average of 59.75. At the end of the first Test on 19 March 1877 Charles Bannerman had become the first Test batsman to score 150 runs in a Test career. He finished the Test on 169. In terms of batting partnerships. Charles Bannerman and Nat Thomson were the first ever international batting partnership (the first ever international opening batting partnership) and they made 2 runs together before Nat Thomson was bowled by Allen Hill for 1. Charles Bannerman was selected for the 2nd Test of the 1876‚Äì77 Series. He opened the batting at No. 2 once again partnering Nat Thomson. He and Thomson added 29 for the first Wicket when Thomson was dismissed for 18. Charles was then joined by Australia's wicket-keeper, batting at No. 3, Jack Blackham. However, after batting for 55 minutes he was bowled by Allen Hill for 10. He had now increased the record career score to 179. On the 3rd day (3 April 1877) Charles batted at No. 3. He came in when Australia were 88 for 1 to partner Nat Thomson. He partnered Thomson and Thomas Kelly. After just 13 minutes when on 30, he hit George Ulyett's bowling to Harry Jupp. He became the first, at that time, to score 200 runs in a career and now had scored 209. On the first official Australian tour of England in 1878, Bannerman topped the averages and scored the first century by an Australian in England, but no matches recognised as Tests were played on this tour. He had a career first-class batting record of 1,687 runs at 21.62. He did not represent Australia again, officially because of ill-health, but it was suggested that he could not cope with celebrity status, and that gambling debts and alcohol left him impoverished. He continued to play for New South Wales until 1888. Umpiring Between 1887 and 1902, Bannerman stood as umpire in 12 Test matches in Australia. His first match was between Australia and England at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) from 28 to 31 January 1887. England won by 13 runs after scoring only 45 runs in their first innings. His colleague was Elisha Rawlinson, standing in his only Test match.Wisden Australia, 2004-05 (p. 237) lists \\"Rawlinson, Elisha Barker, Test umpire, b. Apr. 10, 1837. d. Feb. 17, 1892\\". Bannerman's last match, at Melbourne in the 1901‚Äì02 season, was also a close low-scoring affair with Australia winning by 32 runs. On this occasion his colleague was Bob Crockett standing in his first season as a Test umpire. In two of the matches in which Charles Bannerman officiated, his brother Alick was a player, but no accusations of bias could be made as Alick scored only 23 runs in four innings. In the fifth Test of the 1897‚Äì98 series, Bannerman turned down a confident lbw appeal against Australian batsman Joe Darling when the match was in a tense situation. The lbw was reportedly \\"obvious\\" but the bowler had run in front of the umpire who was unsighted and had to reject the appeal. Darling, then on 50, went on to score 160 and Australia won the match. After the game Bannerman lodged an official complaint against the English wicket-keeper who had accused him of cheating, and the player was rebuked. Benefit and family In the 1922‚Äì23 season, the first radio broadcast of a cricket match anywhere in the world was a match played as a benefit for Charles Bannerman, from which he received ¬£490. He died in Sydney, survived by his widow Mary Ann, n√©e King, two sons and three daughters; three of the children were the issue of his first marriage to Ellen, n√©e Neale.

Arnold currently works as an international commentator. He was the first Twenty20 International cap for Sri Lanka. He retired from cricket in 2007. International career Arnold made his Test debut against Pakistan in 1997 and his One day international debut against South Africa later in the year. Originally an opening batsmen, Arnold has since moved down the batting order. He is most famous in the pearl island as a utility and very versatile player, making him ideally suitable for the limited over version of the game. However, when he started his career, he was seen primarily as a solid top order batsmen where he impressed against Australia during the AIWA cup of 1999, as well as the subsequent Test series against them, where he batted at No. 3. Failure in the 2003 Cricket World Cup saw him sidelined for many months. However, he fought his way back into the side with a string of good scores in domestic cricket for his club, Nondescripts. A calm and cool player in a crisis situation, Arnold has dragged Sri Lanka out of many sticky situations. He is highly valued for his gritty qualities and is considered an unselfish team man. He is considered an ideal No. 6; he is a Methodist Christian of Tamil descent as is Muttiah Muralitharan. Nicknamed \\"Rusty\\" by Roshan Mahanama and Pramodya Wickramasinghe, due to it being a very common nickname for the name Russel, and also it complemented his batting style as tough and durable- though not really pretty. His late cut shot is admired by many critics at that time where he used the shot so often to spin bowling. During a match against India at Sharjah, Arnold helped Sanath Jayasuriya to post his highest individual score of 189. Sanath and Arnold had a good partnership until Sanath stumped after a brilliant 189. He along with Sajeewa de Silva set the record for the highest 10th wicket stand for Sri Lanka in ODI history(51) Retirement During April 2007 he announced, through team manager Michael Tissera, that he intended to retire from international cricket after the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup final, which came as a shock to Sri Lankan cricket. He cited the pressure of too much travel as his reason. After retirement, he played A-grade cricket in Sydney for Hornsby District Cricket Club and has also played numerous games for the Melbourne Super Kings in Melbourne. He also coached at Barker College, a prestigious private school in Sydney's north. He also was assistant coach to Decan Chargers in the IPL before the team was removed from the competition.

He has represented India in more than 200 international matches in all three formats of the game. He is the third highest wicket-taker for India in One Day Internationals (ODIs) and has represented India in the 1999 Cricket World Cup and the 2007 World Cup. He played for the Delhi Daredevils and the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, and captained Mumbai to its 40th Ranji Trophy title in 2013. He made his Test and ODI debuts in 1998 and T20I debut in 2006. In 2013, Agarkar announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. Post- retirement, Agarkar began a new career as a cricket analyst. Agarkar is the one of the India's best bowling all-rounders in International Cricket. He still holds the record for the quickest 50 in ODIs by an Indian batsman coming off just 21 balls. Personal life Agarkar was born on 4 December 1977 in Bombay, to Meena and Balachandra Agarkar. He has one sister, Manik Agarkar.Hari Menon (8 November 2004), \\"Bones Of A Riddle\\", Outlook India. Retrieved 20 March 2019. Agarkar started out as a batsman as a child before he was entrusted to cricket coach Ramakant Achrekar by his father. On Achrekar's insistence, Agarkar shifted his school from IES to Shardashram Vidyamandir for Class six. He developed as a batsman who could bowl a bit during this time while practicing at the Shivaji Park. He went on to perform consistently as a batsman scoring heavily in the inter-school Giles Shield tournament for the Under-16s making a triple century when he was 15. He carried the form into the Harris Shield under-19 tournament scoring consistently \\"showing signs of being another Tendulkar in the making.\\" It was during this time that he began shifting focus to his bowling after it was \\"pointed out to [him] that it would be hard to make it into the Bombay team as a pure bowler, and that he stood a better chance as an all-rounder\\". As a child, Agarkar idolized pacers Kapil Dev, Michael Holding and Ian Botham; later also taking a liking to Allan Donald. Agarkar is an alumnus of Ruparel College in Matunga. He married Fatima Ghadially and has a son named Raj with her. He resides in Narayan Pujari Nagar on the Worli Seaface in South Mumbai in Maharashtra. Bowling style He has a relatively short figure as compared to his other fast bowling counterparts. But he could still bowl at speeds more than 90 mph (~142‚Äì150 km/hr) owing to his athletic body and a good run up speed. He has had a knack of bowling conventional swing at the start of the innings and reverse swing deliveries late in the game. He was generally a wicket taking bowler being the fastest (at the time) to 50 wickets. However, he was fairly expensive, with high economy rates. International career Agarkar made his ODI debut against Australia at Kochi, on 1 April 1998. He took the wicket of Adam Gilchrist in that match. Soon after his debut, a 20-year-old Agarkar achieved his first Man of the match award in a crucial Coca-Cola champions trophy match against New Zealand taking four crucial wickets while India was defending just 220 on 17 April 1998. The positive start to his early career, Indian fans were hopeful of him forming a strong bowling partnership with Javagal Srinath. Srinath had been sidelined by injury during Agarkar's 1st season and was the only successful pace bowler in the National Team. The emergence of Ashish Nehra in 1999 and Zaheer Khan in 2000 created further competition for pace bowling options especially in home conditions. Frequent injuries to Srinath, Nehra, and Agarkar meant India struggled with pace bowling resources. While Agarkar remained a part of the team, he wasn't able to hold down a guaranteed place due to frequent injuries and severe competition for places especially after the emergence of Irfan Pathan in 2004. He was an important part of the hugely successful Indian team in 2002 and 2003 with Agarkar contributing some memorable performances with the bat and the ball. During this period, he was also a member of the Indian team which finished in the runner-up spot in the 2003 World Cup in South Africa. Amongst Agarkar's better performances were his performances in Australia in the Test series of 1999, and also in the test series in 2003. At Adelaide Oval in 2003, Agarkar took 6/41, to help India to win their first test in Australia in over 20 years. Agarkar has performed better in ODI cricket, where he takes wickets regularly, although his economy rate is high. He has also had a number of good batting performances. He was the best Indian bowler in the one-day series during India's tour of West Indies in 2006. As a batsman, Agarkar is one of the few players who scored a Test century at Lords against England during India's tour to England in 2002 when he scored 109 not out. Although India lost the test, his batting skills were quite noticeable. He also holds the record of the fastest fifty in ODI's for India when he scored 67 not out in 25 balls at Rajkot against Zimbabwe in 2000.Fastest fifties at Cricinfo However, his batting exploits have been frequently overshadowed by seven consecutive instances of no scoring against Australia, five in Australia and two at home. His first four dismissal also happened to have been on the first ball he faced. He is currently the 3rd highest wicket taker (288) for India in ODI's after Javagal Srinath (315) and Anil Kumble (337). One of the notable performances in the domestic cricket came in the 2009‚Äì10 Ranji trophy finals against Karnataka in which he took 5 wickets in the second innings ensuring a narrow win for Mumbai. On 16 October 2013, Agarkar announced his retirement from all forms of cricket just before the start of the 2013‚Äì14 Ranji season. = As an all-rounder = John Wright used to send Agarkar as a pinch hitter in ODIs up the order to increase the scoring rate. He demonstrated good batting skills with extra slogging. Some of his acclaimed knocks in ODIs are when he smacked the fastest 50 in 21 balls in 2000 against Zimbabwe and took 3 wickets as well in that match, in another knock 95 against West Indies in 2002 at Jamshedpur when he was sent up the order at number 3. In the same season in 2002 he joined the group of few Indians to have scored a century at Lord's, when he scored a century in the first test of series batting at no. 8. He got a runner-up medal in 2003 World Cup. =Records= Early in his career, Agarkar broke Dennis Lillee's world record for the fastest 50 wickets in ODIs, achieving the feat from only 23 matches. He held the record from 1998 until 2009 when Ajantha Mendis achieved the feat from just 19 matches. Agarkar holds the Indian record of scoring the fastest 50 in ODI: he scored 50 off 21 balls. Agarkar also holds another ODI record, which is the quickest in terms of fewest matches played to take 200 wickets and complete 1000 runs. Agarkar achieved this feat in 133 matches breaking the previous record held by South African Shaun Pollock, who accomplished this feat in his 138th match. During India's 1999-2000 tour of Australia, Agarkar set a record of seven consecutive innings resulting in ducks (four of them first ball), which earned him the nickname \\"Bombay Duck\\". The wicket takers were Damien Fleming, Brett Lee, Mark Waugh, Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath. Domestic career Agarkar represented Kolkata Knight Riders in Indian Premier League for three seasons. In the fourth season, he was contracted by Delhi Daredevils for US$210,000. In February 2012 it was announced that Agarkar would captain Mumbai in the 2012 Vijay Hazare Trophy. He was also the captain of the Mumbai team that won the 2013 Ranji Trophy. Though his performance was rather lacklustre in the initial parts of the 2013 Ranji Trophy, he showed his class towards the end of the tournament. In the quarter-final, he scored 52* (from 53 balls) against Baroda to ensure a mammoth total of 645/9 declared. In the semi-final against Services, he scored 145 and made a 246-run 7th wicket partnership with wicketkeeper Aditya Tare (120) to rescue Mumbai from 169/6, and take the total to 454/8 declared.

Nehra had a career troubled with injuries and fitness issues. In an interview, he revealed that he had gone under as many as 12 surgeries. Yuvraj Singh had even once joked about this and said \\"Ashish Nehra is player who can get injured while sleeping too‚Äù. Due to fitness issues, he was absent from the national scene for extended stretches but was a part of the Indian team in two Cricket World Cup campaigns, two Asia Cups and three ICC Champions Trophy. He had also been particularly effective in the Indian Premier League, in which he has represented five different teams. Nehra was called \\"one of the best bowlers that the India national cricket team has ever seen\\" by Ravi Shastri. M.S. Dhoni also suggested Nehra's name as the future bowling coach for India considering his massive experience, his ability to swing the ball both ways and his ability to bowl well under pressure. Nehra announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in late 2017, with the Twenty20 International match against New Zealand on 1 November 2017 at Feroz Shah Kotla Ground his last appearance. Javagal Srinath, in honour of Nehra's career said, \\"This is the saddest retirement the sport has had to see since Sachin Tendulkar and will leave a hole that cannot be filled. His expertise, way of mentoring the team, and leading from the shadows will never be forgotten by any of the team members.\\" On the eve of his farewell game, Delhi & District Cricket Association renamed one end of the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground as \\"Ashish Nehra End\\" and thus Nehra became the second bowler in cricket history, after James Anderson (cricketer), to have bowled from an end named after him. Nehra was the second oldest player to represent India in T20Is, at the age of 38 years 186 days, only exceeded by Rahul Dravid, who played at the age of 38 years 232 days. Early and personal life Nehra was born in 1979 in Delhi in Jat family to Diwan Singh Nehra and Sumitra Nehra.http://www.jatmahasabha.in/2009/09/ashish-nehra-jat-cricketer-from- delhi.html Ashish Nehra He has a brother Dinker Nehra.

He was a student and learned cricket under directions of Mr Tarik Sinha who is still coaching in sonnet cc. International career Nehra made his Test debut against Sri Lanka at Colombo in 1999 and his ODI debut against Zimbabwe at Harare in 2001. On his Test debut, Nehra started out well, dismissing Marvan Atapattu early but then failed to pick up any more wickets. Similarly, he dismissed Alistair Campbell with only his 2nd ball in ODIs. He was also part of the Indian team's run at the 2003 World Cup in South Africa. It was there against England, that he got his career-best ODI figures of six for 23. His performance in the other matches in the World Cup were also noteworthy. However inconsistency and successive back and ankle injuries prevented him from cementing his place in the Indian team. His career statistics are better in ODI cricket than in Test cricket, but with 157 ODI wickets at an average of 31.72 his average is higher than three of his contemporary competitors for fast bowling places in the Indian team ‚Äì Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar, who all had bowling averages below 30. A later crop of fast bowlers such as Munaf Patel, RP Singh and Ishant Sharma also added to his competition. Nehra completed recovery from a bowel injury in March 2006 and tried to make a comeback into the Indian team. He was recalled to the ODI squad for the tour of West Indies in June 2009 after 4 years due to an injury to Zaheer Khan. In 2011 Cricket World Cup, Nehra played his first game vs South Africa. He was expensive giving away 65 runs during 8.4 wicket-less overs. He gave away 16 runs in 4 balls when he had to defend 13 runs in the last over. After this, many thought Nehra's World cup was over. He was, however, a surprise inclusion against Pakistan in the semi-final ahead of Ravichandran Ashwin. Nehra redeemed himself by being the most economical bowler for his side taking 2 wickets in 10 overs for 33 runs as India beat Pakistan by 29 runs. He however could not play the final due to a fractured finger on his right hand. After recovering from his injury, Nehra made himself available for the 2011 ODI series in England; after being ignored, he commented that he was 'deeply hurt'. Despite the backing of former Indian bowler Manoj Prabhakar and a decent Ranji season, he was ignored for the subsequent tour of Australia as well. Recently, Nehra made a national comeback in the T20 squad for India's tour of Australia 2016, the Asia Cup and the world T20. He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2016 T20 World Cup by the ICC and Cricinfo.https://www.cricket.com.au/news/icc-world-t20-team-of-the-tournament- india-roy-de-kock-kohli-root-buttler-watson-russell/2016-04-04 After performing against Australia and Sri Lanka, he was promoted to India's main bowler at the age of 36. He continued his good performances into the England T20 series in 2017, taking 3 for 28 in 2nd match. Nehra played his last ever international match in a T20I against New Zealand on 1 November 2017. India won the match by 53 runs, with Nehra bowling the final over. Domestic career Nehra hit the headlines with creditable showings in the second season of the IPL in 2009.

He is among few professional cricketers who used to wear spectacles. In 1982/1983, he became the first batsman to score three consecutive centuries in one-day internationals.Hundreds in consecutive innings espncricinfo.com Retrieved 7 July 2019 Sometimes known as 'the Asian Bradman', Zaheer Abbas is regarded as one of the finest batsmen in the history of cricket. In August 2020, he was inducted to the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. Career Abbas made his Test match debut in 1969; in his second Test he scored 274 against England, which is still the sixth-ever highest score by a Pakistani batsman. This was the first of his four Test double-centuries; only two men from Pakistan (Younis Khan and Javed Miandad) have scored more. The last was an innings of 215 against India in 1983, the first of three centuries in consecutive Tests, and his hundredth first-class century; Abbas and Geoffrey Boycott are the only two batsmen to have scored their hundredth first-class century in a Test match. Abbas had great success in first-class cricket, and was the first Asian batsman to score one hundred first-class centuries. He had a long stint with Gloucestershire; joining the county in 1972, he remained there for thirteen years. During that time he scored over a thousand runs in the majority of his thirteen seasons. He also made over two thousand runs in a single season on two occasions for the club (1976 and 1981). During those thirteen years at Gloucestershire, he played 206 first-class games, scoring over 16,000 runs. He averaged 49.79, hitting 49 hundreds and 76 fifties. Abbas is the only player to have scored a century and double century in a first- class match four times, finishing each of the eight innings not out.

Abbas had two stints as captain of the national team in 1981 and 1984. He retired from international cricket in 1985, and has officiated as a match referee in one Test and three ODI matches. He has also worked as the manager of the national team. In 2015 he became ICC president, the third cricketer after Colin Cowdrey and Clyde Walcott, to hold the post.

A right-arm fast bowler, Waqar is regarded as one of the greatest bowlers of all time. He is the current bowling coach of the Pakistani cricket team. As of 2012, he holds the record for the youngest Pakistani Test captain and the third youngest Test captain in history (22 years 15 days). He played 87 Tests and 262 One Day International (ODI) matches for Pakistan during his international cricket career from 1989 to 2003. Younis' trademark was his ability to reverse swing a cricket ball at high speed. He took 373 Test wickets and 416 One Day International wickets during his career. Together with bowling partner Wasim Akram, he formed one of the world's most feared bowling attacks. Younis has the best strike rate, after Dale Steyn, for any bowler with over 350 Test wickets. He is the youngest bowler to take 400 wickets in ODI cricket. He is widely recognised as one of the world's best ever bowlers, though most commentators agree his career statistics weakened after his back injury in 1991. Despite this, he would place in the top ten of all time based on ICC rankings. He worked as a bowling coach with the national side from 2006 to 2007. Waqar was appointed as the coach of the Pakistan cricket team on 3 March 2010. He resigned as Pakistan's cricket coach on 19 August 2011 citing personal reasons. He joined Sunrisers Hyderabad as their bowling coach for the Indian Premier League 2013 season. On 4 September 2019, Younis was appointed by the PCB as Pakistan's new bowling coach on a 3-year contract. He replaced Azhar Mahmood, who was sacked after Pakistan's disappointing performance in the ICC World Cup 2019 tournament. Early and personal life Younis was born in Burewala Distt.Vehari, Punjab, Pakistan. He had studied in Sadiq Public School, Bahawalpur Pakistan, the Pakistani College (Pakistan Islamia Higher Secondary School) in Sharjah and the Government College in Burewala. He was raised in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, where his father was a contract worker. He returned to Pakistan and started playing cricket there during his adolescent years.He used to travel to Burewala to play cricket which garnered him the nickname of the Burewala express.https://dunyanews.tv/en/Cricket/414729- He is married to Dr. Faryal Waqar Younis, a Pakistani Australian. They have a son Azaan Waqar and daughters Mariam and Maira Waqar and now live in Kellyville in Australia.Waqar swings in for new life on the Hill. Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved 15 June 2007. Younis has also worked as a television sports commentator for the Nine Network in Australia and for Ten Sports in the United Arab Emirates. Playing career Waqar Younis, coach of the Pakistan national cricket team, prepares to bowl during a net prior to a 50-over warm-up match against Somerset at the County Ground, Taunton, during Pakistan's 2010 tour of England. Waqar began his cricket career in 1987/88 Pakistan, playing for several first-class cricket clubs. However he suffered an injury when he had cut and removed his little finger on his left hand, after he had jumped into a canal. He recovered from this accident and went on to continue his sporting career. He was eventually discovered by former Pakistan captain, Imran Khan and was selected to be part of the national side. He had played only six first-class games when he got picked for the Pakistan camp out of the blue. Waqar says \\"I remember Imran was not feeling well at the time, and was not present at the camp. Luckily the Super Wills Cup was going on, and there was a match between United Bank and Delhi XI. Saleem Jaffar got injured, and I got the opportunity to play that game. Imran watched me on TV, and actually came to the ground to watch the end of the game. The very next day, he met me and told me that I will be going to Sharjah next month. Just meeting Imran at the time was enough of an experience for me, but for him to notify me of my selection was just out of this world.\\" =Domestic= English audiences became aware of Waqar's talent during the early 1990s, when he played for Surrey. By taking 113 wickets in 582 overs for Surrey in 1991, at a mere 14.65 apiece, and by carrying on his shoulders an otherwise moderate county attack, he announced himself as one of the finest contemporary bowlers. There he displayed excellent cricketing performances and attracted attention from the sporting public. He went on to win the English County Championship with Glamorgan in 1997. He took 7 wickets for 25 against Lancashire at Liverpool on 21 June 1997, which included a hat-trick achieved after narrowly missing a hat-trick and took 68 wickets in the season. =International= Waqar made his International cricket debut for Pakistan against India on 16 November 1989, in the same match that Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar made his debut. Waqar took 4 wickets in the drawn match including the wickets of Tendulkar and Kapil Dev. He made an immediate impression with his speed and became known in the cricket media as \\"Wiki\\" or the \\"Burewala Express\\". Waqar along with Wasim Akram opened the bowling attack regularly for Pakistan, becoming a feared and potent attack. At his peak, he developed into a very quick fast bowler and achieved a hat-trick in a One Day International match against New Zealand in 1994. During the early periods of 2000, he stayed out of the Pakistan team for a brief period allegedly due to suspension and conflicts with bowling partner and captain Akram. His return to cricket came with him being appointed the captain of Pakistan. However, he had to deal with allegations of ball-tampering and a number of controversies. In July 2000 Waqar was banned to play in an international match for ball tampering and was fined 50% of his match fee. He was the first cricketer to be banned from playing in a match for such incident. He was involved in further controversy during 2003 World Cup matches. In the opening match against Australia, Waqar was removed from the attack after bowling a beamer at Andrew Symonds, becoming the first bowler to be disciplined in such a way during an international match. The Pakistanis then crashed out of the group stage after winning only two matches, both against associate member teams. After the tournament he conceded the captaincy and was dropped from international selection. After a nearly 15-year career, Waqar announced his retirement from cricket altogether in April 2004. . At the end of his career he finished as the second highest wicket taker for Pakistani in test cricket with 373 wickets. Coaching In March 2006, he was appointed as the bowling coach for Pakistan. He resigned from this position on 6 January 2007 in protest against the Pakistan Cricket Board decision to retain him only for the Test series against South Africa and not for the subsequent series of five One Day International matches. He also blamed captain Inzamam-ul-Haq for going with Mushtaq Ahmed instead of him for the bowling coach position. He was re-appointed as Pakistan's bowling and fielding coach for their tour of Australia in December 2009. In February 2010, Younis was appointed the head coach of Pakistan after Intikhab Alam was sacked as coach, owing to the low level of performances of the national side during the tour of Australia earlier that year. Waqar's first job as coach was to lead an inexperienced Pakistan side missing Younis Khan, Mohammad Yousuf and Shoaib Malik to the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 as a consolation, though Waqar had two top-notch bowlers in Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif at his disposal. He guided the defending champions to the semi-final of the tournament before they were eliminated by Australia, whose Mike Hussey struck three sixes in the final over. The World Twenty20 was followed with the 2010 Asia Cup in which Pakistan lost to Sri Lanka by a narrow margin as Pakistan's top order collapsed and Shahid Afridi's 109 just failed to guide Pakistan to victory. In the following match Pakistan lost narrowly against India courtesy of a six by Harbhajan Singh from the third ball of the final over. The following match was a dead rubber between Pakistan and Bangladesh and another Afridi century meant Pakistan scored 385 runs and they comfortably won the match by 139 runs. A tour of England followed, with two Twenty20's against Australia and two Test matches. Pakistan won both Twenty20's comfortably and the first Test saw Pakistan defeated by 154 runs. Pakistan rallied in the second Test and for the first time in 15 years Pakistan defeated Australia in a Test match. The previous victory in 1995 was also assisted by a superb bowling spell by Waqar Younis. This tour was followed by a controversial tour of England as Pakistan headed in to the final Test match needing to win it to level the series 2‚Äì2. The News of the World broke the news that Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif and captain Salman Butt were involved in Spot-fixing. This saw the three players temporarily suspended and Pakistan lost by an innings and 225 runs ‚Äì their biggest defeat in history. Low team morale meant the next two T20 matches were won comfortably by England, and the subsequent ODI series was won 3‚Äì2 by England as well. This was followed by a tour of Abu Dhabi against South Africa. Pakistan lost the first Twenty20 match by six wickets following a batting collapse. Pakistan also lost the ODI series of five matches 3‚Äì2. Pakistan won the second ODI due to Abdul Razzaq's superb performance of 109* off 72 balls. The Test series of two matches with South Africa was drawn. He also stated that now it was the time for Pakistan to rally and prepare for the World Cup. Pakistan started the World Cup campaign in a strong fashion winning 5 out their 6 group matches and finishing on top of their group. Pakistan went on to beat West Indies in the quarter-finals by 10 wickets but lost to India in the semi-finals by 29 runs. Waqar eventually stepped down as Pakistan coach in August 2011 citing personal reasons but a rift with captain Shahid Afridi may have been a contributing factor. In March 2013 it was announced that he would join Sunrisers Hyderabad as their bowling coach for the Indian Premier League 2013 season. In May 2014, Waqar was reappointed as the head coach of Pakistan Cricket team for a period of two years, commencing from June 2014, hence serving in that capacity for the second time. Waqar resigned from the position of Head Coach of Pakistani Cricket team, on April 4, 2016. Waqar said the reasons behind his resignation were cricket board's failure to work on his recommendations and leak of a confidential report after the World T20. He will serve as the head coach for Multan Sultans During the Third season of the Pakistan Super League. In 16 November 2017 Waqar appointed as a mentor for Sylhet Sixers a team of Bangladesh Premier League for 2017. As of March 15, 2018 Waqar appointed for their head coach for the next two editions of Bangladesh Premier League After the Cricket World Cup 2019, Waqar was reappointed as bowling coach of Pakistan Cricket team for a fourth time. = 2016 ICC World Twenty20 = Waqar Younis faced great criticism after Pakistan was unable to make it to the semi-finals, with less pressure on the fact that the country had not seen international cricket for a number of years, Younis was initially blamed. After winning against Bangladesh in the Twenty20 2016, the team lost against New Zealand, India and Australia, leading to their outing. Waqar 'begged' for forgiveness to the nation and said he was ready to retire if it was needed but also said it could have been due to the lack of cricket in their own country. However, he later wrote in his report that he blamed Pakistan's poor performance in the matches on player Shahid Afridi. Younis submitted the report to the PCB where it was somehow leaked to the media. He expressed his anger and said that the report was confidential ‚Äì it caused fans, on social media sites, to express disappointment in him to see him shifting the blame onto Afridi. Younis, in the report, accused Afridi of being 'non-serious' during the matches and said Mohammad Hafeez hid his knee injury as well, which also affected their performance. He also said Afridi either performed poorly himself, or that other players did not listen to him as a captain. Regarding the report, he said the PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) were painting him as the bad guy and skipped meeting with him regarding the issue later on as it is most likely that they leaked the report. He then also scrapped plans of retirement and said he wanted to focus on the leak, despite his contract as coach ending in June 2016. Younis said he did not want to blame individuals but largely singled out players, particularly Afridi. He said Akmal should not have been selected, instead it should be players who are 'proud' to represent their country. He also said that the team lost the Asia cup in February 2016 because they were 'unfit' as they had not trained during PSL season and said it was like a 'holiday for them'. Overall, he blamed it on poor captaincy from Afridi. He said it was unfair for him to first use Mohammad Nawaz, a new player, as a bowler in the Asia Cup 2016 because it 'destroyed' his confidence when he was unable to handle it after being hit for 38 runs in 3 overs. Younis later posted on his Twitter ‚Äì 'no one wants to hear the truth'. On 4 April 2016, Waqar resigned as Head Coach of the team, just after Shahid Afridi resigned as T20 captain. His reason behind it was the PCB who he said had used him as the \\"scapegoat\\" and shown him as a \\"villain\\" by leaking the Twenty20 report. He stepped down as coach 3 months before his contract would end and said that his scrapped salary should definitely be invested in domestic cricket. He added that he had tried his best to revive the team but they were still unable to better their performance and his recommendations in the report were badly handled by the PCB, who refused to even talk about the leak. Waqar Younis said his services to Pakistan cricket should not be forgotten and said he was stepping down with a heavy heart. Style Waqar is one of several Pakistani fast bowlers, beginning with Sarfraz Nawaz, who have been successful at bowling reverse swing, because he was used as an old-ball bowler early in his career until Imran Khan retired. In partnership with Akram, Younis opened the Pakistan bowling attack in the 1990s. Cricket critics and scholars attribute Younis and Akram to be one of the most effective fast bowling partnerships in cricket history, due to their ability to swing the ball at high speed. The ability to reverse swing and his speed led to him becoming one of the most talented bowlers in modern cricket. Waqar explained his ability to reverse swing by the manipulation of an old ball; with one side shiny, one side rough, the ball would move in the opposite direction to conventional swing. This led to Waqar having the ability to bowl inswingers and outswingers in the cricket pitch and in effect both Waqar and Akram became successful in taking wickets by this variation of swing bowling. His fastest timed delivery in cricket was 153 km/h or 95.1 mph, a delivery he bowled against South Africa in 1993 but this was after he had suffered serious back injuries which had really reduced his bowling speeds. He was also effective in the use of bouncers or short pitch deliveries; Waqar's bowling against South Africa in Sheikhupura in Pakistan, is remembered for his effective use of the short pitched delivery. Following Pakistan's victory during the Test match series versus England in 1992, the English media were suspicious of the reverse swing delivery. It was relatively unknown to the cricketing world during that period and this led to accusations of foul play by critics, however cricket officials found no evidence of foul play and the skill of the reverse swing delivery has been accepted in cricket. Sri Lanka fast bowler, Lasith Malinga, who became the first bowler in World Cup history to take two hat-tricks, has said that he learnt to bowl his deadly yorkers by watching Pakistan's legendary pair of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. No doubt over the years several bowlers have learned and mastered the skill of reverse swing but there are still some techniques which haven't have been explored, e.g. banana swing. The title of Banana Swing Bowler was given to Waqar Younis because of his unique technique of swinging the ball in the air at very high speed before hitting the ground. In most of his hat tricks he has delivered banana swing balls which were unplayable. Despite his qualities as a fast bowler, he was expensive at times and sometimes lacked the consistency of bowlers such as West Indian fast bowler Curtly Ambrose and Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath. This may be partly due to the mentality of his former captain, Imran Khan, who prioritised aggression and speed. Fan following The world's fastest sprinter and runner Usain Bolt, who is from Jamaica (in the West Indies), once replied while being asked about who were his heroes when he was a child: \\"When I was really small I loved the Pakistan cricket team. Waqar Younis was one of the greatest bowlers ever, and I was a bowler so I really enjoyed watching him. I was a big Pakistan fan until I got older, when I noticed that I should actually support my home team.\\" When asked what if there was a match between Pakistan and Windies, Bolt remarked \\"I would still have supported Pakistan, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying ‚Äì when I was little, it was all about Pakistan.\\" Award and records *Waqar is the second best strike rate holder in Test Match Cricket with a minimum of 10,000 balls being bowled He has a strike rate of 43.4 even after bowling 16224 deliveries, which made him second only to Dale Steyn who has a strike rate of 42.0 after bowling 17707 deliveries in test match cricket. *Waqar was named among the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1992 for his sporting achievements. He is also the only bowler to have taken 5 wickets in an innings in 3 consecutive One Day International matches. In terms of deliveries bowled, he has taken the fastest 300, 350 and 400 wickets in One Day International matches. *Although primarily a fast bowler, Waqar scored 1010 Test match runs during his career. As of September 2005, he was the only non-batsman to achieve a thousand runs without scoring a fifty. Waqar holds the record for the best strike rate for any bowler with over 350 Test wickets. *Waqar Younis holds the record for the best bowling figures as a captain in an ODI(7/36) and was also the first captain to take a 7 wicket haul in an ODI innings. *He also holds the record for scoring the most career ODI runs when batting at number 10 (478) *He's the youngest ever bowler to take a five wicket haul in an ODI innings (at the age of 18 years and 164 days) *He holds the record for taking the most 4 wicket hauls in ODI cricket(27) *He holds the record for taking the most consecutive five wicket hauls in terms of innings(3) and he's also the only player to achieve this milestone for 3 successive times *He is the only bowler to take 3 successive 4fers in an ODI innings thrice in his career =Five wickets in an innings= Waqar Younis has taken five or more wickets in an innings on 22 occasions in Test cricket. In One Day International matches, he has taken the most number of five-wicket hauls (on 13 occasions). ICC Hall of Fame Younis was inducted in the ICC Hall of Fame of 9 December 2013. He became the 70th male inductee into the Hall of Fame, joining compatriot Hanif Mohammad as well as his former teammates Imran Khan, Javed Miandad and Wasim Akram. On his induction he said: \\"It's a huge honour for me, I'm truly grateful to the people who've considered me worthy of such an honour.\\" References External links * * Category:Pakistan Test cricketers Category:Pakistan Test cricket captains Category:Pakistan One Day International cricketers Category:Pakistani cricket captains Category:Glamorgan cricketers Category:Karachi cricketers Category:Multan cricketers Category:National Bank of Pakistan cricketers Category:Rawalpindi cricketers Category:Redco Pakistan Limited cricketers Category:Surrey cricketers Category:United Bank Limited cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:One Day International hat-trick takers Category:Pakistani cricket commentators Category:Cricketers at the 1996 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 1999 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 2003 Cricket World Cup Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Pakistani expatriates in the United Arab Emirates Category:Pakistani emigrants to Australia Category:People from Vehari District Category:Australian people of Punjabi descent Category:Sadiq Public School alumni Category:Pakistani cricketers Category:Warwickshire cricketers Category:Recipients of the Pride of Performance Category:Allied Bank Limited cricketers Category:Lahore Blues cricketers Category:Indian Premier League coaches Category:Sri Lanka Premier League coaches Category:Pakistani cricket coaches Category:Cricketers from Burewala Category:Australian cricket coaches Category:Australian cricket commentators Category:Recipients of Hilal-i-Imtiaz Category:Coaches of the Pakistan national cricket team ","title":"Waqar Younis"},{"id":"894438","text":"Rashid Latif (born 14 November 1968), is a Pakistani cricket coach and former cricketer and captain, who played Pakistani cricket team in Test cricket and One Day International matches, between 1992 and 2003 as a wicket keeper right- handed batsman. He also served as the captain of the Pakistan cricket team in 2003, leading the country in 6 test and 25 one-day matches. Early life & domestic career Latif was born in Karachi, and earned a BSc in computer systems engineering from NED University of Engineering and Technology with Saeed Anwar. In April 2006, Latif retired from first-class cricket as he toured with the Pakistani senior players to play against Indian senior players in April 2006 in a series played between players who have retired from professional cricket. Latif has not participated in domestic first-class cricket since 2005. His last match was in 2006, when he played for Lashings cricket club, a club in England. International career Latif started playing for the Pakistan national cricket team in 1992 after the 1992 Cricket World Cup. He impressed the national selectors by scoring 50 runs in his Test debut, however it did not cement his place in the national squad as throughout his career he had to compete with another Pakistani wicket-keeper, Moin Khan. Despite having a significantly similar Test batting average, Moin had a higher ODI average than Latif and scored more runs than Latif in international cricket. However, Moin had the keeping record of 2.14 dismissals per test against Latif 3.51 per test. Moreover, in all time Pakistani XI Latif picks as wicket-keeper and hence 69 test matches of Moin is a question mark in Rashid Latif tenure. In 1996, he announced his retirement after conflicts with some players and the team management. He returned to the Pakistan team and became the captain of the National side in 1998. Latif remained out of the national squad until 2001, when after a string of poor performances, the Pakistan team replaced Moin Khan. After returning into the squad, he secured his place by keeping the wicket and giving a string of good batting performances. The highlight of his career came after the 2003 Cricket World Cup, when he was announced the captain of the Pakistan team. Under his leadership, Pakistan successfully experimented with several new players and the team gave positive results. He was also involved with uniting the players through his captaincy in both on and off the cricket field. However, problems between Latif and the team management again surfaced in 2003‚Äì04, which resulted in him giving away the captaincy to former Pakistan batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq. He was omitted from the squad and since then has never been recalled in the team, despite his attempts to get back into the squad during 2003‚Äì05.  Drop-Catch Controversy and End of Test Career  Rashid Latif claimed a catch against Bangladesh batsman Alok Kapali in Multan in 2003. However, replays showed clearly that the catch was dropped and Rashid deliberately claimed a dropped catch. At the time, he maintained his innocence and stated that if he knew he had not taken a clean catch, he would have called the batsman back. Mike Procter, the match referee, found Rashid guilty and banned him for five international matches. The game was very close, and Bangladesh lost the game by just one wicket. Rashid Latif later acknowledged that he knowingly and wrongfully claimed that catch. However, he stated that he had no regret over his action. > \\"I did realize immediately that the ball rolled out of my hand and it > touched the ground. I conveyed that to my senior players. I gave an option > to recall the batsman but it was decided that we will let him go. But I have > no regrets.\\" - Rashid Latif He was dropped from the squad and never got back in the Pakistan test squad after this incident. Coaching career =Afghan coaching= Latif has notably become batting coach of the Afghanistan National Cricket team. Latif also stated that the Afghan players were keen to learn from him.http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the- newspaper/sport/afghan-players-keen-to-learn-rashid-770 Latif further added that he liked the challenge of coaching the team and helping at grass-roots level of Afghan cricket; in July 2010 he also talked about having a Pakistan- Afghanistan cricket series in late 2010 to help Pakistan return to staging international cricket. As a wicket-keeper Latif also commented on the form of Pakistani wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal by stating that \\"Kamran has gained weight for a wicket-keeper, his wicket-keeping has been poor due to that and a lot of work load as a cricketer. I strongly suggest to all wicket-keepers that when they are struggling they take a rest and then comeback to the scene stronger as poor wicket-keeping can destroy you confidence as a batsman.\\" In August 2010 the coach of the Afghan team Kabir Khan announced that he was going to leave his post because of consistent interference by the board. This led to Latif, who was batting coach at the time, to be named his successor. However just after that Latif announced his resignation also citing consistent interference caused by the board. Latif's stint as Afghan coach got off to a good start when Afghanistan registered a 162-run win over Kenya in the ICC Intercontinental Cup but then lost the first ODI by 92 runs as Kenya were bowled out for 160. But then Afghanistan's batting order collapsed for 88. The team took a six-wicket victory during the second ODI as Kenya succumbed to 139 and Afghanistan suffered a poor start with opener Noor Ali retiring hurt and Karim Sadiq being caught. However Asghar Stanikzai scored his second half- century and along with Mohammad Shahzad who scored 37 guided the run chase. The finest moment of Latif's coaching career came at the 2010 Asian Games when Afghanistan upset the cricket super-power Pakistan in the semi-final as Afghanistan sealed a comfortable 22-run victory and set up a final tie with Bangladesh.upset Pakistan in cricket at 2010 Asian Games However Afghanistan lost the final but the celebrated accomplishment was that the Afghanistan collected their first ever Asian games medal with a second-place silver. Latif's team next assignment was the ICC Intercontinental Cup and Afghanistan play Scotland in the final. Latif stated that Afghanistan likes to play aggressive cricket and that the players are mentally very tough and hate to lose.Preparations for ICC cup final going well for Afghanistan ‚Äì Latif On 2 December the match against Scotland started and because of Hamid Hassan Scotland were bowled out for 212. More than half of Scotland's runs came from Neil McCallum who scored 104*. Afghanistan got off to a good start but collapsed to 171 all out, giving Scotland a 41-run lead. Despite this another great bowling performance from Hassan and Samiullah Shenwari meant that Scotland were skittled for just 82 in their second innings. On the third day Afghanistan sealed victory early in the day with seven-wickets in hand courtesy of a superb 56* by Mohammad Shahzad.Afghanistan seal ICC Intercontinental Cup victory =Controversy= In 2010, Latif responded to the spot-fixing allegations against the Pakistan team by saying that ICC needs to re-design its laws and rules to root out the match-fixing and spot-fixing problem. Latif wrote a letter to the ICC citing his concerns back in 2003,\\"In that letter, I told them to change the rules and laws in one-day internationals which, were more prone to spot-fixing. I even offered to assist the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit but I got no response,\\" he said. \\"The key is to design laws and rules that do not allow players and bookmakers to manipulate things. I told the ICC remove the fielding restrictions and they introduced the power-play which only encouraged fixing.\\" Following this statement Latif resigned from his job as wicket-keeping coach at the Pakistan National Cricket Academy and subsequently reconciled with the Afghan Cricket Board and returned as the team's coach He stated that his aim was to help the team get the status to play Test cricket in two years' time. Latif also stated that he believed that a broad-cast delay of 30 seconds would help curb fixing.

Personal life Rameez Raja has family roots in the city of Jaipur, in the Indian state of Rajasthan. On his wife's side, his mother-in-law is from Delhi and his father- in-law is from Karnal.Inzamam-ul-Haq, 28 May 1997, Outlook India. Retrieved 1 September 2018. Domestic career Rameez made his first-class cricket debut in 1978, scoring over 9,000 runs in List A and 10,000 runs in 1st class matches. He remains one of only a few to reach 10,000 1st class runs in Pakistan. He got a national call against England. He was regarded as one of the prominent batsman playing in Pakistan's domestic circuit. International career =Golden years= He received his opportunity to play in a Test match against England. His performance was unimpressive, as he was dismissed for 1 run in each innings. However, with the retirement of several players in the Pakistan squad and with the help of his years of experience in first-class cricket, Raja was able to secure a spot in the national side. Rameez played international cricket for 13 years, appearing in 57 Test matches, with a career average of 31.83 and scoring two centuries. In the One Day International arena, he played 198 matches and scored 9 centuries. He was a member of the national side that reached the semi finals of the 1987 World Cup. He scored 2 centuries in the 1992 World Cup, which was held in Australia, including a century against New Zealand, who had been undefeated during that period. He was awarded the man of the match for his match winning performance which earned Pakistan a place in the semi-finals of the tournament. In the final against England, Rameez had the honour of taking the final catch which won the World Cup for Pakistan. This became the pinnacle of his cricketing career, as within a year of this triumph, he had lost form and was dropped from the national side. = Obstructing the field = Rameez became the first player in One Day International history to be given out \\"obstructing the field\\" against England, in a match at Karachi in 1987. England had scored 263 runs for 6 wickets during their 44 over innings. For Pakistan, Raja opened the batting and had reached 98 runs when the last ball of the match was bowled, with Pakistan needing 25 runs to win in the last over. During this last over, he hit the ball and sprinted for two runs that would have given him his century, but was well short of the crease when the fielder's return came towards him and Raja knocked the ball away with his bat and was given out for \\"obstructing the field\\". =Late career= However, he was recalled back to the Pakistan squad and played in the 1996 Cricket World Cup. During the 1995‚Äì1996 season, he was removed from the captaincy, after Pakistan lost their first home series to Sri Lanka. His final game in a Test match for Pakistan was as captain in the 1996‚Äì1997 tour of Sri Lanka, however the team failed to win a match during the series. He retired from all forms of cricket in 1997 and since then he has been active as a television commentator and as an administrator for both Pakistan and international cricket. Commentary career Raja has worked as a commentator on Test Match Special and Sky Sports, during the 2006 England Test series against Pakistan.

They are sometimes called ant-like flower beetles or ant-like beetles. The family comprises over 3,500 species in about 100 genera. Description Profile of an anthicid Members of the genus Anthelephila are ant-like in superficial appearance. Their heads constrict just in front of the pronotum, forming a neck, and the posterior end of the pronotum is usually narrow as well. Legs and antennae are slender, heightening the ant-like appearance, and the body is sparsely covered with setae. Biology Adult beetles are omnivorous, being known to consume small arthropods, pollen, fungi, and whatever else they can find. Some species are of interest as biological control agents, as they can eat the eggs or larvae of pests. Larvae are either omnivorous, predators, or fungus-eaters; the young of one species of Notoxus have been observed boring into sweet potato tubers. Many members of the family are attracted to cantharidin, which they seem to accumulate and that deters possible predators. Taxonomy Synonyms of the family include Notoxidae and Ischaliidae. The earliest known members of the family are from the Early Cretaceous (Barremian) aged Lebanese amber, including Camelomorpha of the subfamily Macratriinae. References * Donald S.

The town is 1050 m above sea level, and about 88 kilometres from the port city of Durban. It enjoys warm summers and cool dry winters. A snappy chill descends upon Howick when snow falls on the nearby Drakensberg. The town is located on the N3 freeway, connecting it with the rest of South Africa. The town is the location of Howick Falls, which is a large waterfall that occurs when the Umgeni River falls 95 metres (311 feet) over dolerite cliffs on its way to the Indian Ocean. The waterfall was known as kwaNogqaza or \\"The Place of the Tall One\\" by the original Zulu inhabitants. There are several other waterfalls in the vicinity and all of them have claimed human lives. Near Howick are Cascade Falls (25 m) and Shelter Falls (37 m), while Karkloof Falls (105 m) is 16 km to the east. There are also a number of schools in Howick, including Howick High School.  History  During the 1840s travellers moving north from Pietermaritzburg crossed the Umgeni River just west of present-day Howick at the Alleman's Drift. In 1849, the Wesleyan Missionary James Archbell bought three farms above the northern bank of the Umgeni River. Title deeds of the original plots simply named the area \\"The Village on the Umgeni Waterfall\\". In 1850, the river crossing was moved to the dangerous but more convenient spot at the top of the Falls. This was less than from where the river plunged over the cliff's edge. It was a treacherous spot, and many travellers and wagons were swept over the falls. With the increase in traffic to the north, the Government decided to establish a village at the crossing, and purchased part of James Archbell's farm. In November 1850, a proclamation appeared in the Natal Government Gazette, offering 36 village allotments on the Umgeni Waterfall Drift for sale. This marked the beginning of the town. In choosing a name for the new town, Government officials decided to honour their Secretary of State for the Colonies in London. He was Earl Grey, and had recently acquired the title of Lord Howick. The name derived from his ancestral home of Howick Hall in Northumberland, England. Two other towns were named \\"Howick\\" at the same time: one in New Zealand, and the other in Ontario, Canada. During the Anglo-Boer War from 1899 to 1902, the British established a concentration camp on the outskirts of the village. A monument to the women and children who died during their incarceration in the camp marks the location. A little known fact about Howick (and nearby Karkloof) is that it is possibly the location of the first manned flight in the world. Evidence exists that a John Goodman Household flew a self made glider in 1871 and again in 1875 on the outskirts of Howick, close to Karkloof. The actual distance flown and altitude achieved differs from source to source (some sources say the distance was ) but what can be verified is that the distance flown was further, and the duration also longer, than either of the flights made by Lilienthal or the Wright brothers. Today there exists a memorial to Household's achievement at Curry's Post, also a small distance outside Howick. The Umgeni Valley Ranch or Nature Reserve was established in the 1970s on the then outskirts of Howick by the Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa (WESSA). The nature reserve consists largely of the deep valley cut by the Mngeni River below the Howick Falls into the surrounding sandstone. WESSA reintroduced game into the area, such as zebra and wildebeest, and established a number of huts for overnight accommodation. In December 1996 Nelson Mandela was awarded \\"The Freedom of Howick\\". This followed his arrest some 34 years before, on 5 August 1962, on the main Durban-Johannesburg road, as it was then ‚Äî more particularly, between Howick and Lidgetton West. The previously small plaque commemorating the event has since been revamped into a fully operational Mandela Monument with a museum and large bust sculpture of Nelson Mandela, only fully distinguished when viewed from inside the establishment. The sculpture was created by Marco Cianfanelli and is constructed of steel beams of between in length. Artwork at Mandela Capture site, Howick Replica of Nelson Mandela Artwork at Apartheid Museum by Marco Cianfanelli The annual Mandela day marathon takes place in Imbali, Pietermaritzburg and finishes at the Mandela capture site in Howick. In recent years Howick has expanded significantly following the establishment of a number of major retirement villages, such as Amberfield, Amberglen, Amber Valley, Amber Ridge, BrandonsField and Amber Lakes, that flank the Karkloof Falls Road.

Biography He started his professional career by impersonating Greek public figures, mainly sports people (e.g famous sportscaster Giannis Diakogiannis and Filippas Sirigos) and politicians (prime ministers Konstantinos Karamanlis and Andreas Papandreou) on radio satiric shows on FM Radio station \\"Athens 98.4\\". The name of his show had the -completely- random title, \\"The conspirators of the night, in the conspiracy of the patsas\\" (Greek: ŒüŒπ œÉœÖŒΩœâŒºœåœÑŒµœÇ œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒΩœçœáœÑŒ±œÇ, œÉœÑŒ∑ œÉœÖŒΩœâŒºŒøœÉŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ œÄŒ±œÑœÉŒ¨), in which his co-presenator was, the later well-known TV presenter, Nikos Evaggelatos. But he was doing amateur radio shows some time before as university student (in the Buness Management department of AUEB) on college radio. His debut on TV was in 1990. Since then he has been on many Greek channels, and afterwards started to impersonate actors, singers and journalists as well, and changed the form of his shows. All of the titles of his shows are a word play, usually with his name. It is said that sometimes when a Greek celebrity called a restaurant or a hotel to book a seat, the persons on the other end of the line thought it was Mitsikostas making pranks. Mitsikostas has admitted he has done such things in the past. There is a famous political anecdote concerning the Greek politician and former prime minister of Greece for many years Andreas Papandreou, who upon first hearing the then mostly unknown Mitsikostas imitating him on the radio having a conversation with leader of the then opposition and also former Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis, called his minister, alarmed about a scam being raised against his party by imposters. Mitsikostas also impersonates sports people from Greece.

They are granivores, and typically infest various kinds of seeds or beans, living most of their lives inside a single seed. The family includes about 4,350 species and are found worldwide. Bean weevils are generally compact and oval in shape, with small heads somewhat bent under. Sizes range from 1 to 22 mm for some tropical species. Colors are usually black or brown, often with mottled patterns. Although their mandibles may be elongated, they do not have the long snouts characteristic of true weevils. Adults deposit eggs on seeds, then the larvae chew their way into the seed. When ready to pupate, the larvae typically cut an exit hole, then return to their feeding chamber. Adult weevils have a habit of feigning death and dropping from a plant when disturbed. Host plants tend to be legumes, but species will also be found in Convolvulaceae, Arecaceae, and Malvaceae, and several species are considered pests. One characteristic of the beetles which can be seen in the photo is that the elytra are short, not quite reaching the tip of the abdomen. Several species are native to Great Britain, but there are also records of several introduced species from stored products in warehouses and dwellings, although these species cannot proliferate outside of heated buildings in that climate.

It was founded as the School of Mines in 1863 and then the School of Mines, Engineering and Chemistry before becoming the School of Engineering and Applied Science. On October 1, 1997, the school was renamed in honor of Chinese businessman Z.Y. Fu, who had donated $26 million to the school. The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science maintains a close research tie with other institutions including NASA, IBM, MIT, and The Earth Institute. Patents owned by the school generate over $100 million annually for the university. SEAS faculty and alumni are responsible for technological achievements including the developments of FM radio and the maser. The School's applied mathematics, biomedical engineering, computer science and the financial engineering program in operations research are very famous and ranked high.NRC Rankings Overview: Applied Mathematics ‚Äì Faculty ‚Äì The Chronicle of Higher Education. Chronicle.com (September 30, 2010). Retrieved on 2013-10-05.The Top 10 Quant Schools The current SEAS faculty include 27 members of the National Academy of Engineering and one Nobel laureate. In all, the faculty and alumni of Columbia Engineering have won 10 Nobel Prizes in physics, chemistry, medicine, and economics. The school consists of approximately 300 undergraduates in each graduating class and maintains close links with its undergraduate liberal arts sister school Columbia College which shares housing with SEAS students. The School's current dean is Mary Cunningham Boyce, who was appointed in 2013. History =Original charter of 1754= Included in the original charter for Columbia College was the direction to teach \\"the arts of Number and Measuring, of Surveying and Navigation [...] the knowledge of [...] various kinds of Meteors, Stones, Mines and Minerals, Plants and Animals, and everything useful for the Comfort, the Convenience and Elegance of Life.\\" Engineering has always been a part of Columbia, even before the establishment of any separate school of engineering. An early and influential graduate from the school was John Stevens, Class of 1768. Instrumental in the establishment of U.S. patent law, Stevens procured many patents in early steamboat technology, operated the first steam ferry between New York and New Jersey, received the first railroad charter in the U.S., built a pioneer locomotive, and amassed a fortune, which allowed his sons to found the Stevens Institute of Technology. (Excerpt from SEAS website.) When Columbia University first resided on Wall Street, engineering did not have a school under the Columbia umbrella. After Columbia outgrew its space on Wall Street, it relocated to what is now Midtown Manhattan in 1857. Then President Barnard and the Trustees of the University, with the urging of Professor Thomas Egleston and General Vinton, approved the School of Mines in 1863. The intention was to establish a School of Mines and Metallurgy with a three-year program open to professionally motivated students with or without prior undergraduate training. It was officially founded in 1864 under the leadership of its first dean, Columbia professor Charles F. Chandler, and specialized in mining and mineralogical engineering. An example of work from a student at the School of Mines was William Barclay Parsons, Class of 1882. He was an engineer on the Chinese railway and the Cape Cod and Panama Canals. Most importantly he worked for New York, as a chief engineer of the city's first subway system, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. Opened in 1904, the subway's electric cars took passengers from City Hall to Brooklyn, the Bronx, and the newly renamed and relocated Columbia University in Morningside Heights, its present location on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. =Renaming to the School of Mines= In 1896, the school was renamed to the \\"School of Mines, Engineering and Chemistry\\". During this time, the University was offering more than the previous name had implied, thus the change of name. The faculty during this time included Michael I. Pupin, after whom Pupin Hall is named. Pupin himself was a graduate of the Class of 1883 and the inventor of the \\"Pupin coil\\", a device that extended the range of long-distance telephones. Students of his included Irving Langmuir, Nobel laureate in Chemistry (1932), inventor of the gas-filled tungsten lamp and a contributor to the development of the radio vacuum tube. Another student to work with Pupin was Edwin Howard Armstrong, inventor of FM radio. After graduating in 1913 Armstrong was stationed in France during World War I. There he developed the superheterodyne receiver to detect the frequency of enemy aircraft ignition systems. During this period, Columbia was also home to the \\"Father of Biomedical Engineering\\" Elmer L. Gaden. =Recent and future developments= The university continued to evolve and expand as the United States became a major political power during the 20th century. In 1926, the newly renamed School of Engineering prepared students for the nuclear age. Graduating with a master's degree, Hyman George Rickover, working with the Navy's Bureau of Ships, directed the development of the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, the Nautilus, which was launched in 1954. The school's first woman graduate received her degree in 1945. After a substantial grant of $26 million from Chinese businessman Z. Y. Fu, the engineering school was renamed again in 1997. The new name, as it is known today is the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. SEAS continues to be a teaching and research institution, now with a large endowment of over $400 million, and sits under the Columbia umbrella endowment of $7.2 billion. Admissions The admissions rate for the SEAS undergraduate class of 2018 was approximately 7%.http://www.columbia.edu/cu/opir/abstract/opir_admissions_history_1.htm Approximately 95% of accepted students were in the top 10% of their graduating class; 99% were in the top 20% of their class. 58% of admitted students attended high schools that do not rank.

Specialized centers Columbia Engineering faculty are a central force in creating many groundbreaking discoveries that today are shaping life tomorrow. They are at the vanguard of their fields, collaborating with other world-renowned experts at Columbia and other universities to bring the best minds from a myriad of disciplines to shape the future. Large, well-funded interdisciplinary centers in science and engineering, materials research, nanoscale research, and genomic research are making step changes in their respective fields while individual groups of engineers and scientists collaborate to solve theoretical and practical problems in other significant areas. Last year, Columbia Engineering's 2007‚Äì2008 research expenditures were $92,000,000, a very respectable number given the small size of the school. Harvard's research expenditures in the same period were $35,000,000. Columbia Engineering PhD students have ~60% more monetary resources to work with using the research expenditure : PhD student ratio. Specialized labs The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science occupies five laboratory and classroom buildings at the north end of the campus, including the Schapiro Center for Engineering and Physical Science Research and the new Northwest Building on Morningside Heights. Because of the School's close proximity to the other Morningside facilities and programs, Columbia engineering students have access to the whole of the University's resources. Carleton Laboratory main testing floor The School is the site of an almost overwhelming array of basic and advanced research installations which include both the NSEC and the MRSEC NSF- funded interdisciplinary research centers, as well as the Columbia High-Beta Tokamak, the Robert A.W. Carleton Strength of Materials Laboratory, and a 200g geotechnical centrifuge. The Botwinick Multimedia Learning Laboratory is the School's facility for computer-aided design (CAD) and media development. It is equipped with 50 Apple Mac Pro 8-core workstations, as well as a cluster of Apple Xserves with Xraid storage, that serve the lab's 300-plus users per semester.

It is situated on a low mountain spur overlooking the valley of the Yaw River. Loi Leng, the highest mountain of the Shan Hills, is located to the south-east of Lashio. Lashio is the administrative center of Lashio Township and Lashio District; before April 2010, it was also the administrative center of Shan State (North). The population grew from approximately 5000 in 1960 to 88,590 in 1983. It is currently estimated at approximately 130,000. The population is made up of mostly Shan, Chinese and Burmans. History The British colonial period in this part of the country began in 1887, and the Myanmar Railways line from Mandalay reached Lashio in 1903. Before British rule Lashio was also the centre of authority for the northern Shan States, but the Burmese post in the valley was close to the Nam Yao, in an old Chinese fortified camp. The Lashio valley was formerly very populous; but a rebellion, started by the sawbwa of Hsenwi, about ten years before the British occupation, ruined it. In 1900, the town of Lashio consisted of the European station, with court house and quarters for the civil officers; the military police post, the headquarters of the Lashio battalion of military police; and the native station, in which the various nationalities, Shans, Burmans, Hindus and Muslims, who were divided into separate quarters, with reserves for government servants and for the temporary residences of the five sawbwas of the northern Shan States; and a bazaar. Lashio became important during the Sino-Japanese War resp. World War II as the Burmese terminus of the Burma Road 1938‚Äì45. In World War II, Lashio was taken by the Japanese April 29, 1942 and liberated by the Allies March 7, 1945. Climate Lashio has a humid subtropical climate (Cwa) according to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, marked by heavy rains from May to October. The annual rainfall averages .

Legal issues =Israeli tax investigation= In 1996, NDS was investigated by Israeli authorities for allegations of tax irregularities. None was proven but NDS later paid a $3m settlement to close the case. =Canal Plus lawsuit= In 2002, Canal Plus accused NDS of extracting the UserROM code from the MediaGuard cards and leaking it onto the internet. According to The Guardian, the NDS laboratory in Haifa, Israel had been working on breaking the SECA-produced MediaGuard smartcards used by Canal+, ITV Digital and other non-Murdoch-owned TV companies throughout Europe. Canal Plus brought a $3 billion lawsuit against NDS but later dropped the action. News Corporation agreed to buy Canal Plus's struggling Italian operation Telepi√π. =Echostar lawsuit= Echostar sued NDS for $1 billion for piracy and copyright infringement of the Echostar viewing card codes and for aiding the distribution and supply of pirate Echostar viewing cards for the Echostar- owned Dish TV. EchoStar alleged that in the 90's NDS was responsible for the compromise of EchoStar's satellite television programming platform through the posting of code on the DR7 website. NDS vigorously defended the allegations made against it, establishing that NDS played no part in the compromise of EchoStar's security system. In 2008, a jury in California convicted NDS of violating the Federal Communications Act and California Penal Code, cleared NDS of other charges, and awarded $1,500 in damages. In August 2010, the Ninth Circuit stated in its decision that ‚ÄúEchoStar did not succeed 'on any significant issue' or 'achieve any of the benefit it sought in bringing suit' under the Communications Act.‚Äù The Ninth Circuit awarded NDS US$18 million and concluded that ‚ÄúThere is no question that NDS successfully defended against all of EchoStar‚Äôs claims based on or related to its theory that NDS was responsible for the compromise of EchoStar‚Äôs satellite television programming security system.‚Äù In February 2011, the Ninth Circuit further stated, ‚ÄúNDS was the prevailing party in this litigation and that EchoStar fails to meet the legal definition of a prevailing party on any of its claims.‚Äù In January 2012, the Supreme Court of the United States of America denied a petition to hear a challenge by EchoStar. EchoStar and NDS agreed that the terms for satisfying the judgment should be met by 9 March 2012. On 9 March 2012, NDS received from EchoStar the remaining balance of US$18,935,399.49, in full satisfaction of the final judgment, including district court fees and costs, appellate court fees and costs and all interest. =BBC Panorama= On 26 March 2012, the BBC programme Panorama broadcast that NDS employed computer hacking to undermine the business of ONDigital. At the time, ONDigital was the primary TV rival in Britain of BSkyB, a News Corporation company. The accusations arise from emails obtained by the BBC, and an interview with Lee Gibling, the operator of a hacking website, who claims he was paid up to ¬£60,000 per year by Ray Adams, NDS head of security. UK broadcasting watchdog Ofcom is to investigate these claims. These claims are vigorously denied by NDS and NewsCorp.News Corporation‚Äôs NDS Denies ITV Digital Hacking Claims. ITProPortal.com.

The Australian Financial Review also published online a sample of 14,400 emails allegedly taken from the computer of former NDS head of security Ray Adams. The investigation by the paper alleges that NDS illegally undermined rivals Austar, Optus and Foxtel at a time when parent company News Corporation was moving to take control of the Australian pay TV industry. In response to these allegations, Australia's communication minister Steven Conroy called for a police investigation. In response to the allegations, News Limited, the Australian arm of News Corporation released the following statement: \\"The story is full of factual inaccuracies, flawed references, fanciful conclusions and baseless accusations which have been disproved in overseas courts,\\" Products and customers As of December 2011, NDS VideoGuard CA and DRM were deployed in more than 125 million digital pay-TV households.

The ‚ÄúKosaka-kaido‚Äù highway connecting Morioka Domain with Hirosaki Domain passed through Kosaka. Under the Nambu, major deposits of gold and silver were mined by the Fujita-gumi, the predecessor to modern Dowa Holdings for the Nambu clan at the Kosaka mine. After the start of the Meiji period, the area became briefly part of Rikuch≈´ Province before being transferred to Akita Prefecture in 1871. It was organized as part of Kazuno District, Akita Prefecture in 1878. The village of Kosaka was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It was raised to town status on May 12, 1914. Economy With the depletion of the mineral deposits at the Kosaka Mine from the 1990s, the economy of Kosaka is now largely based on agriculture, forestry and seasonal tourism. Dowa Holdings, the owner of the Kosaka Mine is active in the metal recycling industry. In terms of light manufacturing, the Towada Audio Corporation, a manufacturer of shortwave radio sets, TV tuners and AC adapters in the Sony group, is based in Kosaka. Education Kosaka has one public elementary school and one public middle school operated by the town government and one public high school operated by the Akita Prefectural Board of Education.

Historic Map of Yamamoto District: Purple - Noshiro-shi Salmon - Happ≈ç-machi Pink - Mitane-machi Orange - Fujisato-machi With the establishment of the municipality system on April 1, 1889, two towns (Noshiroko and Hiyama) and 24 villages were established. Futatsui was raised to town status on June 4, 1902, followed by Kado on January 1, 1932. Noshiroko became the city of Noshiro on October 1, 1940. Hachimori was raised to town status on October 1, 1954. Hiyama was absorbed into Noshiro on April 1, 1955, and the town of Kado was renamed Kotooka. The village of Yamamoto gained town status on September 1, 1962, followed by Fujisato on November 1, 1963 and Hachiry≈´ on September 1, 1965. In 2006, as part of the Heisei period Municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan, all of the district except for the town of Fujisato was scheduled to merge with Noshiro to form the new city of Shirakami. However, the residents of Noshiro were opposed to this name and left the merger conference. The remaining six towns and villages tried to merge, but this plan failed as the merger would turn Hachimori and Minehama into an exclave of the new city. Noshiro delegates attempted to return to the conference, but the other conference members rejected their participation and the meeting split into the three different merger conferences of \\"Noshiro-Futatsui,\\" \\"Southern Three Towns,\\" and \\"Northern Two Towns and Villages.\\" As a result: * On March 20, 2006 - The towns of Hachiry≈´, Koto'oka, and Yamamoto were merged to create the town of Mitane. * On March 21, 2006 - The town of Futatsui was merged with the expanded city of Noshiro, although Futatsui wanted the new city's name to be Yoneshiro (Á±≥‰ª£Â∏Ç). * On March 27, 2006 - The town of Hachimori, and the village of Minehama were merged to create the town of Happ≈ç.

Many forms of cerci serve as sensory organs, but some serve as pinching weapons or as organs of copulation. In many insects, they simply may be functionless vestigial structures. In basal arthropods, such as silverfish, the cerci originate from the eleventh abdominal segment. As segment eleven is reduced or absent in the majority of arthropods, in such cases, the cerci emerge from the tenth abdominal segment. It is not clear that other structures so named are homologous. In the Symphyla they are associated with spinnerets.Tiegs, O. W. The post-embryonic development of Hanseniella agilis (Symphyla). Printed at the University Press, 1945. Morphology and functions Most cerci are segmented and jointed, or filiform (threadlike), but some take very different forms. Some Diplura, in particular Japyx species, have large, stout forcipate (pincer-like) cerci that they use in capturing their prey. The Dermaptera, or earwigs, are well known for the forcipate cerci that most of them bear, though species in the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina do not. It is not clear how many of the Dermaptera use their cerci for anything but defense, but some definitely feed on prey caught with the cerci, much as the Japygidae do. Crickets have particularly long cerci while other insects have cerci that are too small to be noticeable. However, it is not always obvious that small cerci are without function; they are rich in sensory cells and may be of importance in guiding copulation and oviposition. Some insects such as mayflies, silverfish, and bristletails have an accompanying third central tail filament which extends from the tip of the abdomen. This is referred to as the terminal filament and is not regarded as a cercus. Aphids have tube-like cornicles or siphunculi that are sometimes mistaken for cerci but are not morphologically related to cerci. Evolutionary origin Like many insect body parts, including mandibles, antennae and stylets, cerci are thought to have evolved from what were legs on the primal insect form, a creature that may have resembled a velvet worm, Symphylan or a centipede, worm-like with one pair of limbs for each segment behind the head or anterior tagma.

It was developed from the AEG G.III, with refinements to power, bomb- load and dimensions. Coming into service in late 1916, it featured a bomb capacity twice as large as that of the AEG G.II, but was still considered inadequate in terms of offensive capacity and performance. Further improvements led to the development of the G.V, but the Armistice came before the replacement could become operational. Serving late in the war, the AEG G.IV managed to achieve some operational success in reconnaissance and combat roles.Grey and Thetford 1962, p. 7. Design and development The Allgemeine Elektricit√§ts-Gesellschaft (A.E.G.) G.IV was derived from the earlier G.III. Designed as a tactical bomber, the relatively modern technology included onboard radios and electrically heated suits for the crew. Unlike the other German twin-engined \\"G\\" or Gro√üflugzeug-class bombers such as the Gotha and the Friedrichshafen, the AEG featured an all-metal, welded-tube frame, making it a more rugged aircraft.Grey and Thetford 1962, pp. 6‚Äì7.

Operational history A captured AEG G.IVk in British markings, Bickendorf, 1919 The AEG G.IV bomber entered service with the German Air Force in late 1916.Sharpe 2000, p. 15. Because of its relatively short range, the G.IV served mainly as a tactical bomber, operating close to the front lines. The G.IV flew both day and night operations in France, Romania, Greece and Italy, but, as the war progressed, the AEG G.IV was restricted increasingly to night missions. Many night operations were considered nuisance raids with no specific targets, but with the intention of disrupting enemy activity at night and perhaps doing some collateral damage.Grey and Thetford 1962, pp. 7‚Äì8. The AEG G.IV carried a warload of 400 kg (880 lb). While Gotha crews struggled to keep their heavy aircraft aloft, the AEG was renowned as an easy aircraft to fly. Some G.IV crews of Kampfgeschwader 4 are known to have flown up to seven combat missions a night on the Italian front. A notable mission involved Hauptmann Hermann Kohl attacking the railroad sheds in Padua, Italy in his G.IV bomber.\\"His life in brief.\\" Hermann Koehl. Retrieved: 14 April 2011.

He subsequently joined the WPA as a teacher and sculptor until he was drafted into the army in 1942. Lassaw's contribution to the advancement of sculptural abstraction went beyond mere formal innovation; his promotion of modernist styles during the 1930s did much to insure the growth of abstract art in the United States.

He was previously Member for Malvern in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria from 1992 to 2006 and Leader of the Victorian Opposition from 2002 to 2006, representing the Liberal Party. Background Born in Melbourne, Doyle attended secondary school in Geelong. He graduated from Monash University in 1977, and the following year began work as a teacher at Geelong College, his alma mater. In 1982, he moved back to Melbourne, working as a departmental head at Lauriston Girls' School. After three years, he again changed schools, becoming a senior administrator and English teacher at Scotch College. State politics At the 1992 state election, Doyle succeeded in winning Liberal preselection for the electorate of Malvern by defeating Geoff Leigh. The Liberal Party, under Jeff Kennett, won government, defeating Joan Kirner. After the election, Doyle was immediately placed on the Crime Prevention Committee, and several other taskforces, particularly in the area of health. In April 1996, Doyle was promoted to the position of Parliamentary Secretary for Human Services. The Kennett government suffered an unexpected defeat at the 1999 election, and Kennett himself retired from politics soon afterwards. Kennett's deputy and Health Minister, Denis Napthine, became leader, and Doyle became shadow Health Minister. =Leader of the Victorian Opposition= By 2002, the Liberal Party was flagging in the polls, and was expected to lose the election due later that year. Doyle successfully challenged Napthine for the leadership of the state Liberal Party, claiming that the party was \\"facing political oblivion\\" if it stayed under Napthine's leadership.We're facing oblivion: Doyle, The Age, 16 August 2002 He lost the 2002 election by a large margin; the result was in fact the worst showing for the main non-Labor party in Victoria since it adopted the Liberal banner in 1945. The party lost control of the Legislative Council for only the second time in Victorian parliamentary history, while their lower house seat count was more than halved, to 17 seats‚Äìtheir smallest presence in the legislature in half a century. The Liberals were further crippled when the Shadow Treasurer, Robert Dean, was deemed ineligible to stand because he had failed to update his voter registration after moving to a new electorate; under Victorian law, he was no longer on the electoral roll. For some time after the 2002 defeat, Doyle remained Opposition Leader, partly through the sheer shortage of potential alternative candidates for the job in the much-reduced Liberal party room. However, following the decisions of Shadow Minister Victor Perton and Deputy Leader Phil Honeywood to resign, and the further resignation of Doyle's Chief of Staff Ron Wilson and his Director of Communications Rob Clancy, debate as to Doyle's future was re-ignited. Even many of Doyle's key supporters‚Äîincluding Upper House MPs Andrea Coote and Philip Davis, and Michael Kroger and Helen Kroger‚Äîeventually recognised that Doyle's leadership was unlikely to attract sufficient electoral support. It was also reported that Doyle's personal approval rating had dropped to 15 per cent. On 4 May 2006, Doyle announced his resignation as Opposition Leader, stating that \\"I have given my best‚Äîit was not enough\\" and that the move would give the party the \\"best chance of electoral success\\".Doyle: my best not enough, The Age, 4 May 2006 Ted Baillieu succeeded Doyle in the post. He officially ended his term as a Member of Parliament for the District of Malvern on 25 November 2006. On that day, the Liberals under Baillieu were again severely defeated; and as a result, Doyle publicly criticised several prominent party figures. On 21 June 2007 the state government announced that it would appoint Doyle as the new chairman of Melbourne Health, the group that operates the Royal Melbourne Hospital.Doyle gets top health job, The Age, 22 June 2007 Lord Mayor of Melbourne When Lord Mayor of Melbourne John So announced his decision not to contest for a third consecutive term in early October 2008, Doyle emerged as a contender for the Lord Mayoralty in November 2008. Doyle told the media that he \\"was a better than 50-50 chance of running\\".Robert Doyle thinks hard about lord mayor bid, Herald Sun, 4 October 2008 On 27 October Doyle announced his candidacy, saying he could leave partisan politics aside to work with the State Government if he became Lord Mayor.Former Lib leader to stand for Lord Mayor, ABC Online, 27 October 2008 Doyle selected John So's deputy between 2001 and 2004, Susan Riley, as his running mate. On 30 November 2008, Doyle was elected Lord Mayor, defeating Councillor Catherine Ng in a tightly contested election. Doyle also defeated former Melbourne Deputy Lord Mayor and Spotless heir-apparent, Peter McMullin and So's deputy between 2004 and 2008, Gary Singer. Doyle's great-great-grandfather, Robert Bennett, previously served as Lord Mayor (then known as simply Mayor) from 1861 to 1862 and Bennett Lane, of Bennetts Lane Jazz Bar fame in Melbourne is named after him. On 27 October 2012, Doyle was re-elected as Lord Mayor, with an increased majority, defeating high-profile candidate, Gary Morgan and former Councillor and Lord Mayor Candidate, Catherine Ng.https://www.vec.vic.gov.au/Results/MelbourneResult2012.html On 11 November 2015, Doyle announced that he will run again for the office of Lord Mayor in the elections to be held in October 2016. Stating that it was the \\"best job in the world\\" Doyle to Run Again, The Age, 11 November 2015 =Policies= Many of Doyle's policies have been around 'activating' Melbourne as a night time city in conjunction with the Andrews' Government introduction of 24-hour public transport on weekends, extending hours of hospitality operation and continued support of 24-hour arts festivals.Mayor Robert Doyle promises to activate Melbourne as city switches on 24 hours, Sydney Morning Herald, 24 December 2015 In July 2016 Doyle announced that the homelessness problem in the Melbourne CBD had reached \\"emergency\\" levels. Citing a study conducted by the City of Melbourne that the number of homeless people had increased 74% in two years. Doyle has been a vocal supporter of marriage equality, and has appeared regularly on LBGTI radio station Joy 94.9 as a prominent conservative politician. Some of Doyle's policies as Lord Mayor to make the CBD safer and more family friendly have caused mild controversy. Doyle made an election promise to return private vehicle traffic to Swanston Street, Melbourne, which had for several decades been open to limited but mostly pedestrian traffic.New mayor driving down a wrong-way street, The Age, 1 December 2008. The move attracted opposition from the Public Transport Users Association, Greens and Bicycle Victoria. He also raised the idea of a theme park to attract children to the CBD.Lord mayor candidate proposes theme park for Melbourne CBD, Herald Sun. Doyle was also quick to vow to rid the Melbourne city centre of \\"bogans\\"City mayor Robert Doyle scolded by proud bogans, Herald Sun. and \\"untalented\\" buskers.'Badly talented' buskers on Doyle's hit list, The Age, 1 December 2008. Doyle has also openly criticized the state government's handling of Melbourne Docklands, claiming that it lacks 'social glue' and character and wanting more control over the precinct's planning expressing the desire to see more open space in the form of a large park and also Venice style canals. In September 2010, when asked on radio about a move by suburban councils to ban smoking in some outdoor areas due to the risks of passive smoking, he said \\"I don't know of a case of cancer that has been caused by passive smoking.\\" = Tensions with China over Uighur film = In August 2009, Doyle came under pressure from the Chinese Government to intervene and stop the screening of The 10 Conditions of Love at the Melbourne International Film Festival. This Australian-made film is about a prominent Uighur woman Rebiya Kadeer, who China labels a 'terrorist' and claims that she was the orchestrator of the July 2009 √úr√ºmqi riots. Kadeer did attend the screening at the Melbourne Town Hall. The Chinese Consul-General in Melbourne requested a meeting with the Lord Mayor to discuss the matter. Despite the protests from the Chinese Government, Doyle refused to intervene to stop the screening. Subsequently, reports emerged that China would consider terminating the sister-city relationship between Melbourne and Tianjin, one of China's four municipal-level cities and the fifth most populous city in China. Defying the Chinese Government's threat, Doyle lodged a complaint to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, prompting the Department to warn the Chinese Embassy to conduct themselves appropriately. =Occupy Melbourne Street protests inquiry= Doyle was criticised for sending in riot police to evict protesters who had gathered in Melbourne's City Square and had failed to comply with an eviction notice he had ordered to be issued to them, stating on ABC radio they were \\"a self-righteous, narcissistic, self-indulgent rabble (that) tried to capture the city.\\" This action resulted in a range of injuries to protesters. Reports on the number of injuries vary, and while Occupy Melbourne reported \\"43 documented cases of police brutality\\" in press releases, the official report from newspapers is just one protester who was sent to hospital after being trampled on by a police horse. Calls for a public enquiry were turned down by the Lord Mayor who was firm that neither he or Victoria Police acted inappropriately. This led to Occupy Melbourne protesters pressing legal charges against Melbourne City Council for breaching federal law which prohibits the interference of a political protest. Occupy Melbourne protesters then bombarded Robert Doyle with requests for an inquiry online during his 2012 election campaign, to which the Lord Mayor then closed his Facebook and Twitter accounts due to \\"abuse and harassment\\". He later re- launched his online election campaign. =Sexual harassment accusations= On 15 December, City of Melbourne councillor Tessa Sullivan, who was elected on the same ticket as Doyle, resigned from the council and lodged a complaint against Doyle with City of Melbourne chief executive, Ben Rimmer. In her complaint, Sullivan alleged that Doyle had sexually harassed and indecently assaulted her. On 17 December, Doyle released a statement on Twitter, which said he had not been informed of the details of the allegations.

The open tandem cockpit for the pilot and gunner had armour protection . The gunner had three weapons, two 7.92 mm (.312 in) LMG 08/15 machine guns were fitted to the floor of the cockpit for ground targets. One 7.92 mm (.312 in) Parabellum MG14 machine gun was on a rotable mounting. Aircraft fitted with ailerons on the lower wing as well as the upper wing were designated AEG J.Ia.

It is the four-door saloon version of the Tata Indica, a supermini especially designed for developing countries. In 2009, Tata released the second generation of the Indigo, called Tata Indigo Manza to distinguish it from the first generation which remained in production. First generation (2002‚Äì2018) The first generation of the Indigo, which was launched in the Indian market in 2002, is based on the Tata Indica, a subcompact hatchback. The two cars shared a similar design, while the Indigo had a longer wheelbase, a 450 litre trunk, and turbo-diesel and petrol engine options. The car received its first design refresh in 2006, giving it distinguishing features from the Indica, such as more upmarket double-barreled headlamps, front fog-lamps, more upmarket interiors with fabric upholstery, etc. Tata Indigo SW LX rear The 2006 Tata Indigo went on to form the base platform for three other cars: the Indigo Marina station-wagon with a large boot and a ski-rack; the Indigo XL, a variant with a longer wheelbase for increased legroom in the second row, air-conditioner vents for the second row, and leather upholstery option; and the Indigo CS, a smaller version with a length of under 4 metres to take advantage of tax benefits for vehicles of that size. The latter was renamed Indigo eCS after an engine upgrade in 2010. Tata Motors discontinued the Indigo and Indigo Marina in 2009 in favour of the Indigo Manza, a larger sedan based on the Tata X1 platform. The Indigo eCS remained in production, receiving a design refresh and the addition of ABS in 2013. The company also continued to sell the Indigo XL, although only as a variant tailored for use as a taxi, and sold only in bulk to fleet operators. =Indigo Sedan (2002‚Äì2009)= Facelifted Indigo SW sedan (Marina) The first generation Tata Indigo was launched in 2002, and was largely based on the Indica. The two cars shared a majority of their parts. The Indigo had a greater wheelbase than the Indica, to accommodate the more acute-angled C-pillar and the trunk. The front bumper had housings for fog lamps, a feature which the Indica lacked at the time. While the Indica had a 1.4 L naturally aspired diesel engine, the Indigo featured its turbocharged variant, which produced . The car was also offered with a 1.2 L 4-cylinder MPFI petrol engine. The interior of the Indigo featured a few exclusives over the Indica, such as HVAC and fabric upholstery on all variants, and power windows for all doors on the top model. The steeper angle of the C-pillars meant that the Indigo lacked a rear windshield wiper. A minor design refresh in 2004 introduced a new 1.4 L turbocharged diesel engine. In 2006, Tata Motors introduced the first major design update for the Indigo, with new body panels, a redesigned front grille housing double-barreled headlamps, triangular front fog-lamps, a multi-reflector tail-lamp cluster with dual brake lamps; a newer 3-spoke steering wheel, refreshed dual-tone fabric interiors, and an audio system with a CD player. Under the hood, it featured a new 1.4 L Dicor turbocharged common rail diesel engine, which produced and complied with the Bharat Stage III emission norms. The 2006 Tata Indigo formed the base platform for three other cars, the Indigo Marina station-wagon, the Indigo XL sedan, and the Indigo CS compact-sedan. =Indigo XL (2007‚Äì2009)= Launched in 2007, the Indigo XL was a variant of the 2006 Indigo, with its wheelbase increased by 200 mm, and a few upmarket features. The added wheelbase translated into increased legroom in the second seating row and a bigger trunk. Tata Motors positioned it as a premium product and equipped it with a few upmarket features such as optional leather upholstery, rear air- conditioner vents, a rear center arm-rest with cup-holders, and a new 16-valve MPFI petrol engine option, with DOHC and a power output of . It retained the 1.4 L Dicor engine from the Indigo. In 2009, with the introduction of the Indigo Manza based on its newer X1 platform, Tata Motors pulled the Indigo XL from consumer sales, and relegated it only to fleet sales as a taxi. The 2009 Indigo XL retained most of its feature-set from the 2007 original, with the exception of lack of leather upholstery and factory-fitted audio system. The car was offered in three engine variants, beginning with the 16-valve MPFI petrol engine carried over from the original, with a newer Bharat Stage IV- compliant catalytic converter, a dual-fuel CNG variant, which can switch on- the-fly between petrol and CNG, with a factory-fitted CNG kit; and the 1.4 L CR4 turbocharged common-rail diesel engine, also Bharat Stage-IV compliant, with a power output of . =Indigo CS (2008‚Äì2018)= 2014 Tata Indigo CS The Indigo ECS (compact-sedan) was launched in 2008, as a crossover between a hatchback and a sedan, while technically being referred to as the latter. It was originally designed to appeal to buyers who sought an inexpensive \\"3-box\\" car at the price of a hatchback. At launch, the Indigo CS was the shortest sedan in the world, with a length of 3,998 mm. The car's length allowed Tata Motors to avail excise-duty incentives targeted at cars with under 4 meters of length. The Indigo CS retained most of the feature-set of the 2007 Indigo. The car was launched with the 1.4 L TDI turbocharged diesel engine, and the 1.2 L 8-valve, 4-cylinder petrol engine carried over from the Indica Xeta. Both these engines complied with Bharat Stage-III emission norms. In 2010, Tata Motors introduced the first design update to the Indigo CS, in the form of the company's new 1.4 L CR4 turbocharged common-rail diesel engine, rechristening the car as Indigo eCS. The 1.4 L CR4 engine complies with the Bharat Stage-IV norms. Variants of the car, with the Bharat Stage-III compliant TDI engine continued to be sold till 2012. The 1.2 L SOHC petrol engine was carried over, with an upgraded Bharat Stage-IV compliant catalytic converter. In 2012, Tata Motors introduced a high-end version of the car, the Indigo eCS VX, featuring anti-lock braking system (ABS) with electric brake-force distribution (EBD), electrically-adjustable outside rear-view mirrors (E-ORVMs), side repeaters mounted on the ORVMs, and 14-inch alloy wheels. In 2013, the company introduced a more pronounced design refresh of the car, featuring redesigned body panels, chrome-inserts on the front-grille, trunk-lid, and front fog-lamp accents; smoked double-barreled headlamp housing, \\"Sahara Beige\\" fabric upholstery, dual-tone interiors with jet-black and beige tones, a newer 4-spoke steering wheel, and a 2-DIN audio system head-unit, with Bluetooth pairing for smartphones, for hands-free voice calls. The company also introduced variants with factory-fitted CNG kits, called the Indigo eCS e-Max. The car was discontinued in April 2018. Second generation (2009‚Äì2016) The Indigo Manza was launched on 14 October 2009. The variant is based on the Tata X1 platform which was displayed by Tata Motors in its prototype form called Elegante Concept during the 2007 Geneva Motor Show. It is priced between Rs 4.8 lakhs and Rs 6.75 lakhs. The launch coincided with the phasing out of the 2007 Tata Indigo, and the re-positioning of the Indigo XL as a fleet/taxi car. The Indigo Manza features a modern feature-set, including front SRS airbags, ABS with EBD; an audio system integrated into the dashboard, automatic climate control, leather upholstery, diamond-cut alloy-wheels, and a 500-litre trunk. The car is larger than the 2007 Indigo in all dimensions. Tata Indigo Manza rear The car is powered by Bharat Stage-IV compliant engines sourced from Fiat. These include the 1.4 L Fiat FIRE petrol engine (re-branded as Safire), and the 1.3 L MultiJet common-rail diesel engine featuring a variable turbine turbocharger (re-branded as Quadrajet 90). Both engines have a power output rating of 90 HP. In 2011, Tata Motors launched a high-end variant called the Tata Manza Elan. This car offered Italian leather upholstery, and reversing parking sensors. Around the same time, Tata Motors released a new version of the Indica Vista (which until the time, although based on the same X1 platform, featured significantly different body panels and lamp clusters). The 2011 Indica Vista \\"Sedan-class\\" featured mostly identical front-side body paneling, grille, and headlamp clusters to the Indigo Manza, although under the hood, it featured a variant of the 1.3 L Multijet diesel engine. In 2012, Tata Motors launched a design refresh across all variants, called the Tata Manza \\"Club-class.\\" It offered 2-tone body colours (with the roof colour contrasting the rest of the body), updated exterior chrome inserts, 16-spoke alloy wheels, newer 2-tone \\"Sahara Beige\\" or \\"Black Plum\\" interiors with black Italian leather upholstery on the high-end EXL variant; a chrome-insert interior package, leather-wrapped gear lever, and a Blaupunkt-sourced infotainment system, with a 6-inch true-colour touchscreen, GPS satellite navigation software sourced from MapMyIndia, and DVD video playback (usable only when the car is stationary).

They transport weapons systems, equipment, cargo and personnel of the assault elements of the Marine Air/Ground Task Force both from ship to shore and across the beach. It is to be replaced by the SSC. Design and development Concept design of the present day LCAC began in the early 1970s with the full-scale Amphibious Assault Landing Craft (AALC) test vehicle. During the advanced development stage, two prototypes were built. JEFF A was designed and built by Aerojet General in California, with four rotating ducted propellers. JEFF B was designed and built by Bell Aerospace in New Orleans, Louisiana. JEFF B had two ducted rear propellers similar to the proposed SK-10 which was derived from the previous Bell SK-5 / SR.N5 hovercraft tested in Vietnam. These two craft confirmed the technical feasibility and operational capability that ultimately led to the production of LCAC. JEFF B was selected as the design basis for today's LCAC.LCAC U.S. Navy Fact File The JEFF A was later modified for Arctic use and deployed in Prudhoe Bay to support offshore oil drilling. USMC LAV-25s and HMMWVs are offloaded from a USN LCAC craft at Samesan RTMB, Thailand. The first 33 were included in the FY82-86 defense budgets, 15 in FY89, 12 each in FY90, FY91 and FY92, while seven were included in FY93. The first LCAC was delivered to the Navy in 1984 and Initial Operational Capability (IOC) was achieved in 1986. Approval for full production was granted in 1987. After an initial 15-craft competitive production contract was awarded to each of two companies, Textron Marine & Land Systems (TMLS) of New Orleans, La, and Avondale Gulfport Marine, TMLS was selected to build the remaining craft. A total of ninety-one LCAC have now been built. The final craft, LCAC 91, was delivered to the U.S. Navy in 2001. On June 29, 1987, LCAC was granted approval for full production. Forty-eight air-cushion landing craft were authorized and appropriated through FY 89. Lockheed Shipbuilding Company was competitively selected as a second source. The FY 1990 budget request included $219.3 million for nine craft. The FY 1991 request included full funding for 12 LCACs and advance procurement in support of the FY 1992 program (which was intended to be nine craft). The remaining 24 were funded in FY92.Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC), GlobalSecurity.org The LCAC first deployed in 1987 aboard . LCACs are transported in and operate from all the U.S. Navy's amphibious-well deck ships including LHA, LHD, LSD and LPD. Ships capable of carrying the LCAC include the (3 LCACs), (1), (4), (1), (4‚Äì5), (2), and (2) classes. All of the planned 91 craft have been delivered to the Navy. Of these 91 LCACs, seventeen have been disassembled for Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE) or otherwise terminated for cost reasons, two are held for R&D;, and 36 are in use on each coast at Little Creek, Virginia and Camp Pendleton, California. Eight minesweeping kits were acquired in 1994‚Äì1995. A service-life extension program (SLEP) to extend service life from 20 to 30 years for the remaining 72 active LCACs was begun in 2000 and is scheduled to be completed by 2018. The craft operates with a crew of five. In addition to beach landing, LCAC provides personnel transport, evacuation support, lane breaching, mine countermeasure operations, and Marine and Special Warfare equipment delivery. The four main engines are all used for lift and all used for main propulsion. The craft can continue to operate, at reduced capability, with two engines inoperable. They are interchangeable for redundancy. A transport model can seat 180 fully equipped troops. Cargo capacity is . The LCAC is capable of carrying a 60-ton payload (up to 75 tons in an overload condition), including one M-1 Abrams tank, at speeds over 40 knots. Fuel capacity is 5000 gallons. The LCAC uses an average of 1000 gallons per hour. Maneuvering considerations include requiring 500 yards or more to stop and 2000 yards or more turning radius. The bow ramp is wide while the stern ramp is wide. Noise and dust levels are high with this craft. If disabled the craft is difficult to tow. In recent years spray suppression has been added to the craft's skirt to reduce interference with driver's vision. 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The LCAC is a dramatic innovation in modern amphibious warfare technology. It provides the capability to launch amphibious assaults from points over the horizon (OTH) from up to offshore, thereby decreasing risk to ships and personnel and generating greater uncertainty in the enemy's mind as to the location and timing of an assault, thereby maximizing its prospects of success. The LCAC propulsion system makes it less susceptible to mines than other assault craft or vehicles. Due to its tremendous over-the-beach capability, the LCAC can access more than 80% of the world's coastlines. Previously, landing craft had a top speed of approximately and could cross only 17% of the world's beach area. Assaults were made from a few miles off- shore. Its high speed complements a joint assault with helicopters, so personnel and equipment can be unloaded beyond the beach in secure landing areas. For 20 years, helicopters have provided the partial capability to launch OTH amphibious assaults. Now, with LCAC, landing craft complement helos in speed, tactical surprise and without exposing ships to enemy fire. US Navy sailors pilot an LCAC transporting U.S. Marines ashore. The similarities between a Navy LCAC and an airplane are substantial. The craftmaster sits in a \\"cockpit\\" or command module with a headset radio on. He talks to air traffic control which for LCAC's is well-deck control located near a ship's sterngate. The ride feels like a plane in high turbulence. The craftmaster steers with a yoke, his feet are on rudder controls. The LCAC is similar to a helicopter in that it has six dimensions of motion. Operating the LCAC demands unique perceptual and psychomotor skills. In addition, with a machine as expensive and inherently dangerous as the LCAC, sound judgment and decision-making also play an important role. Concerns over escalating training cost, projections for an increased number of LCAC vehicles and crew, and a high attrition rate in training highlighted the importance of developing a more accurate means of selecting candidates. Attrition of operators and engineers has dropped from an initial high of 40% in 1988 to approximately 10‚Äì15% today. Bright Star '09. In Fiscal Year 2000 the Navy started an LCAC Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) to add 10 years of design life to each craft. The SLEP will be applied to 72 LCACs, extending their service life from 20 to 30 years, delaying the need to replace these versatile craft.Surface Connector Outlook, N954 Expeditionary Preposition/Connector Branch, September 2012, CAPT Sean Geaney USN Without a SLEP the first LCAC would face retirement in 2004, based on a 20-year lifespan. Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has been working with Textron Marine and Land Systems since April 1996 on LCAC SLEP research and development. The actual SLEP modifications are planned to be conducted in two phases. Phase I. Over a period of several years electronics system recapitalization will take place at each Assault Craft Unit (ACU), where the craft are physically located. This will involve replacing current electronics components, which are increasingly becoming obsolete and unsupportable, with an open electronics architecture using easily upgraded, Commercial Off-The- Shelf (COTS) components. The new electronics suite will be more reliable and less costly to operate and maintain. Phase II. Buoyancy box replacement will be conducted at the Textron Marine and Land Systems facility in New Orleans, LA, where Textron will use design changes, coatings, and changes in materials to increase the LCACs resistance to corrosion. Phase II will also include the electronics upgrade of Phase I, until the entire active fleet is outfitted with the new configuration. The new buoyancy box will incorporate improvements to damage stability and trim control of the LCACs. NAVSEA transitioned from the research and development effort to the SLEP in 1999. Concurrently NAVSEA also considered additional SLEP options, including an enhanced engine to provide improved operation in excessively hot environments and an advanced skirt that is more reliable and cost effective. The Navy continued the LCAC Service Life Extension Program in Fiscal Year 2001. This program combines major structural improvements with Command, Control, Communications, Computer and Navigation upgrades and adds 10 years to the service life, extending it to 30 years. In FY 2001, it was funded at $19.9 million and extended the service life of 1 craft. The SLEP is planned for a total of 72 craft. The near-term focus will be on the \\"C4N\\" [Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Navigation] program, to replace the crafts' obsolete equipment. This will focus on replacement of LN-66 radars with modern, high-power P-80 radar systems. Additionally, the SLEP will include an open-architecture concept, relying on modern commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment, which will allow much easier incorporation of later technology changes, such as the precision navigation system and communications systems ¬æ fully interoperable with in- service and near-term future Joint systems ¬æ now planned. The C4N program is to complete by 2010. Through 2016, the Navy will look to incorporate other important service-life enhancements: Engine upgrades (ETF-40B configuration) that will provide additional power and lift particularly in hot (43 ¬∞C, 110 ¬∞F, and higher) environments, reduced fuel consumption, reduced maintenance needs, and reduced lift footprint; Replacement of the buoyancy box to solve corrosion problems, incorporate hull improvements, and \\"reset\\" the fatigue- limit \\"clock\\"; Incorporation of a new (deep) skirt that will reduce drag, increase performance envelope over water and land, and reduce maintenance requirements. As of September 2012, there are 80 LCACs in the U.S. Navy inventory. Of these 80 LCACs, 39 LCACs have undergone the SLEP conversion, 7 more SLEP conversions are in progress and 4 are awaiting induction. The FY 2013 budget authorized 4 SLEP conversions per year through FY 2018. The last of the 72 SLEP conversions will be delivered to the Navy in FY 2020. A number of LCACs are under development and testing at the Naval Support Activity Panama City in Panama City, Florida. When the first SLEP LCAC reached its 30 years of design service in 2015, it was to gradually be retired. In 2019, at which point the inventory of LCACs had fallen to 50, the USN began receiving the new Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC), the LCAC-100. The USN inventory of LCACs will continue to fall, as the SLEP LCACs are retired, until 2023, when the inventory will reach a low of 40 SLEP LCACs and SSC LCAC-100s. The inventory will remain at 40 until 2026 when the production of SSC LCAC-100s will begin to outnumber the retirement of SLEP LCACs. Current projections foresee the inventory rising to 60 SSC LCAC-100s in 2031 and 72 SSC LCAC-100s on 2034. =Ship-to-Shore Connector= The SSC LCAC-100 will have an increased payload of 73 short tons. It will have Pilot/Co-Pilot Dual Controls with a smaller crew (5) and a new Command, Control, Communications, Computers & Navigation (C4N) suite. It will also have engines offering 20% more power with new Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC), a simpler and more efficient drive train with one gearbox per side, and a new Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. It will be constructed out of aluminum alloy 5083 which offers a lighter, stronger and performance in extreme environments, plus better corrosion resistance. Other improvements include an immersion grade wet deck coating system and its gear shaft and fan blades will be constructed with extensive composites. It will be able to operate with a 74 short ton load at a sustained speed of 35 knots (40 mph) in NATO Sea State 3‚Äì4 (waves heights of 4.1 to 8.2 feet, averaging 6.2 feet).Expeditionary Preposition/Connector Branch, N954 Surface Connector Outlook, CAPT Sean Geaney USN, September 2012 Ship to Shore Connector Industry Day SHIP-TO-SHORE CONNECTOR(SSC) ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES OVERVIEW SHF SATCOM Terminal Ship-Motion Study, Technical Report 1578, March 1993, M.

On July 28, 1851, Sophia took Rose and her older sister, Una, to visit relatives in West Newton, Massachusetts.Mellow, 375 Growing up, Rose lived in Massachusetts, Liverpool, London, Paris, Rome, and Florence. The family returned to Concord, Massachusetts, in 1860. There, her older brother Julian was enrolled in a co- educational school run by Franklin Benjamin Sanborn. Though their friend, the poet Ellery Channing, recommended the Hawthorne girls attend the same school, neither was enrolled. Sophia wrote: \\"We entirely disapprove of this commingling of youths and maidens at the electric age in school. I find no end of ill effect from it, and this is why I do not send Una and Rose to your school.\\"Mellow, 537 Two years after Nathaniel's death in 1864, Rose was enrolled at a boarding school run by Diocletian Lewis in nearby Lexington, Massachusetts; she disliked the experience.Valenti, 34 After Nathaniel's death, the family moved to Germany and then to England. Sophia and Una died there in 1871 and 1877, respectively. Rose married author George Parsons Lathrop in 1871. Prior to the marriage, Lathrop had shown romantic interest in Rose's sister Una.

They moved out on the day Francis died of diphtheria at the age of five.Valenti, 63‚Äì64 They returned to New York City but moved to New London, Connecticut, in 1877 for George's health.Valenti, 96 There, they became involved with the Catholic summer school movement and collaborated on a book, A Story of Courage: A History of the Georgetown Visitation Convent.Connor, 51 Both she and George converted to Roman Catholicism in 1891. Though \\"To many of their old friends this conversion came as a shock\\", Rose's journey to Catholicism had been years in the making. \\"Their travels through England, Portugal, France and Italy [had] exposed the Hawthornes to the ‚ÄúRoman Church,‚Äù often misunderstood in the Protestant circles of New England...Rose would write of her experience at the age of seven of seeing Pope Pius IX during Holy Week from his balcony: ‚ÄúI became eloquent about the Pope, and was rewarded by a gift from my mother of a little medallion of him and a gold scudo with an excellent likeness thereon, both always tenderly reverenced by me.‚Äù Following Francis' death George had become an alcoholic and was increasingly unstable.Allitt, 143 Una suspected he abused Rose.Wineapple, 8 George also competed with Rose's brother Julian for control of Nathaniel Hawthorne's legacy.Smith and Himmel, 21 In 1883, Julian planned to publish Dr. Grimshawe's Secret, a manuscript left unfinished by their father, but Rose did not believe in its existence and suspected him of forgery or perpetrating a hoax.Valenti, 67 After Francis's death, Rose and Julian tried to end their quarreling and the Lathrops visited him in England in 1881. During that trip, however, they spent more and more time apart.Valenti, 66‚Äì67 They separated permanently in 1895; George died of cirrhosis three years later. =Charity work and religious vocation= Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, from an 1897 publication. Lathrop sought greater purpose in her life and spent time with the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, and was inspired by their motto, \\"I am for God and for the poor.\\"O'Malley, 255 She was further inspired by the death of Emma Lazarus, whom she befriended in 1881.Young, 186 After Lazarus's death from cancer at age 38, Rose recalled that she was at least comfortable, unlike others who were poor. She wrote later, \\"Though I grieved deeply for her, I would not pity her, for she never knew unaided suffering, but every amelioration.\\"Smith and Himmel, 22 As a source for her motivation to work with incurable impoverished people, she cited the story of a young seamstress who was too poor to afford medical treatment and instead had herself admitted to an institution for the insane on Blackwell's Island. In the summer of 1896, Lathrop trained as a nurse at the then‚ÄìNew York Cancer Hospital, the first institution in the United States to provide training in treating cancer while general hospitals in the city did not admit patients with cancer.Smith and Himmel, 23 Later that year, she founded a charitable organization named after Saint Rose of Lima, Sister Rose's Free Home, to care for impoverished cancer patients. At first, she visited patients at home. In October 1896, she rented three rooms in a tenement on Scammel StreetO'Malley, 256 on the Lower East Side, a poor immigrant neighborhood,Smith and Himmel, 18 with the help of an assistant named Alice Huber. A Dominican priest, Father Clement Thuente, O.P., witnessed their work in February 1899 and encouraged them to join the Dominican order as tertiaries (Third Order Dominicans).O'Malley, 257 On December 8, 1900, Lathrop founded a new religious order, with the approval of Archbishop Michael A. Corrigan of New York. The order was named the Servants of Relief for Incurable Cancer; Lathrop became its first Mother Superior, with the name Mother Mary Alphonsa. Alice became known as Mother Rose. The order‚Äînow known as the Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne‚Äîopened a facility called St. Rose's Home on Water Street in Manhattan; it then moved to Cherry Street, before settling north of New York City in what is now Rosary Hill Home in Hawthorne.Connor, 53 Lathrop's brother, Julian, considered her decision to be a martyrdom, writing, \\"Nothing less than the extreme would satisfy her thirst for self-sacrifice.\\" When he was imprisoned for mail fraud, she traveled to Washington, D.C., on April 3, 1913, to ask President Woodrow Wilson to pardon him. Julian was angered by her intervention, and no pardon was granted.Wineapple, 6 =Death and legacy= On July 8, 1926, Lathrop wrote various letters asking for donations until nearly 10 o'clock before going to bed. She died in her sleepValenti, 179 on July 9, the day that would have been her parents' 84th wedding anniversary. She was buried on the grounds of the Motherhouse of the Dominican Sisters in Hawthorne, N.Y. Lathrop received a medal from the National Institute of Social Sciences for \\"notable achievement\\" in 1914. In 1925, she was awarded an honorary Master of Arts from Bowdoin College. On April 18, 1926, the Rotary Club of New York presented her with a service medal as \\"soldier of love, a friend of the poor, organizer of rare ability, hope of the hopeless\\".Valenti, 177 The Rose Hawthorne Guild was established to promote Mother Mary Alphonsa's Cause for Canonization. In 2003, Cardinal Edward Egan, Archbishop of the Archdiocese of New York, approved the movement for Lathrop's canonization. She now has the title \\"Servant of God\\" in the Catholic Church.

Kokstad is named after the Griqua chief Adam Kok III who settled here in 1863. Kokstad is the capital town of the East Griqualand region, as it is also the biggest town in this region. It was built around Mount Currie, a local mountain range, by the city's founder Adam Kok III, for whom the town is named. Stad is the Dutch and Afrikaans word for \\"city\\". Kokstad has a population of about 50,000 people, making it the most populous town in East Griqualand, with most of its population being Xhosa people (Mpondo tribe). The town is built on the outer slopes of the Drakensberg and is 1,302 m above sea level. Behind it Mount Currie rises to a height of 2,224 m. It is a centre for cheese and other dairy products. Kokstad has the N2 Highway south of the town's CBD. The R56 leads from Kokstad to Cedarville (45 km), Matatiele (68 km) and Maluti leading to the border of Lesotho. The R617 is also a bisecting route leading from Kokstad to Underberg (109 km), Swartberg (41 km) and Bulwer (147 km). The N2, the national route, leads from Kokstad to the east to Port Shepstone (175 km), Durban (380 km) and to the south Mount Ayliff (57 km), Mthatha (180 km), East London (419 km) and Qonce (447 km). Kokstad is 10 km from the Eastern Cape border on the N2. The majority of residents can speak IsiXhosa as well as IsiZulu. Kokstad has no rural villages to date. It is a farming community with majority of its countyside land being cattle farms or residential farms.  History  In 1820 the Griqua tribe which lived in Griquatown (in central South Africa) split and under the leadership of Adam Kok III, descendant of the ex-cook who established the tribe, one section first moved to Philippolis (southern Free State). In 1861 several hundred Griquas moved across the Drakensberg down the Ongeluks Nek to the vicinity of modern Kokstad. They moved because of the growing confrontation they faced with the Voortrekkers who had moved north of the Orange River to escape the laws of the British. The Voortrekkers, largely Dutch, secured leases over Griqua land and then refused to return the land at the end of the lease. The big hole of Kimberley was at the centre of controversy over one such lease. The Griquas were forced to travel over the Drakensberg into a region earlier devastated by the great Zulu King, Shaka‚Äîthus its name \\"Nomansland\\". By the time the Griquas arrived in their new promised land eighteen months later they were exhausted and most of their livestock had perished. The impoverished Griquas named the mountain where they settled Mount Currie after Sir Walter Currie who gave support to their effort to settle here. Once settled their leader, Adam Kok, renamed their new land East Griqualand. Every male Griqua who settled in East Griqualand was able to secure a farm, but most of them sold their land cheaply to white settlers and squandered their money. The Rev William Dower in his 1902 book The Early Annals of Kokstad describes in great detail how cheaply the Griqua gave their farms away. St Patricks Catholic Cathedral When, in 1869, the Reverend William Dower was asked by the Griqua to establish a mission, he agreed on condition that they resettle in a more suitable place on the banks of the Mzimhlava river. Two prominent European settlers George Brisley and Donald Strachan played a major role in the early development of Kokstad and East Griqualand: their trading store, Strachan and Co, in 1874 introduced South Africa's first indigenous currency‚Äîa set of trade tokens which circulated across a wide region, covering an area the size of Ireland. Confirmation that the Strachan and Co coins circulated as money in the region at this time comes from the local Standard Bank at Kokstad and the Managing Director of Strachan and Co. In 1878 East Griqualand came into the possession of Cape Colony. The first hotel in Kokstad, The Royal, was opened by an African-American who also started a newspaper (the Kokstad Advertiser) in 1881. Kokstad became a municipality in 1892. In 1904 the population was recorded at 2903 whom a third were Griquas. The town was transferred to Natal province in 1978. Today the population of Kokstad lies at just over 50,000 people. Cultural assets Stemming from a relatively old farming community, Kokstad rose from the lands beneath Mount Currie. Many old buildings and monuments have been erected that are now considered to be National Heritage Sites. * The Adam Kok Monument (Griqua): The monument commemorates the leadership of the Griqua, Adam Kok, who, after leading the Griquas from the Southern Free State to Griqualand East during the 1860s, died after a fall off a cart in 1875. The monument is situated next to the police station of Kokstad. * Kokstad Bandstand (British Colonial): The ornamental, cast iron bandstand dates from 1912. It was donated to the town council by the engineers who were responsible for the Kokstad water scheme. It was declared a national monument in October 1983. * Boy Scouts Monument (British Monument): The monument to former Boy Scouts who fell in the world wars is situated in the foothills of Mount Currie North of Kokstad. * Cape Mounted Rifles Monument (British Colonial): The monumen is a tall column surrounded by four lions peering upwards. It is situated close to the town hall. * St. Patrick's Catholic Church (Cathedral) * East Griqualand Museum and Community Tourism Info Center: Griqua history is the main theme of this museum's display. Although it has several other local history exhibits and items also known as the Kokstad museum. * Old town hall (historical building): The old town hall is considered a National Monument Site. It is one of the largest town structures that predates World War I within the surrounding areas. Currently used for ceremonial practices, it also functioned as the town's library for many years until 2005, when the new library on the neighbouring plot was opened. The town hall is now used for many municipal and political functions, as well as public gatherings ranging from weddings to sporting ceremonies. Attractions The area is popular for its many rivers and dams that provide ample opportunity for trout fishing and hiking possibilities. There are three reserves, Mount Currie, Wilfred Bauer and the Mountain Lake Nature Reserve. These have camping and picnic spots. Among these reserves, the Mountain Lake Nature Reserve contains paths that provide sightseeing walks, as well as over 220 species of birds. The Mount Currie reserve is filled with history. On the site stands a historic laager site surrounded by graves of early pioneers and a monument pays homage to Boy Scouts who died during the First World War in East Africa. The area's many dams provide multiple forms of use. Crystal Springs Dam provides many boating and angling opportunities. The dam is fed by the pure water of Crystal Springs, the main source of Kokstad's water supply. In 1924, William Mortimer Mail (b. 16 November 1885) was to take-up an appointment as the Kokstad Town Engineer, Arguably, Mail's most notable achievement was improvement to Kokstad's drinking water, which at the time of his arrival, was drawn from a mountain stream. Whenever it rained, it became heavily stained. After identifying a suitable spring further down the mountain (Crystal Springs), he first conducted a series of water flow rate metering, to establish there was sufficient flow to meet the town's needs. Once it had been proven there was sufficient flow, Mail then oversaw design and construction of a new water treatment plant. The new plant provided crystal clear water to Kokstad, which helped the town grow and flourish. In addition to supplying drinking water to the town, the Crystal Spring Dam has become an attraction for both the Kokstad residents, and tourists to the area. There are three rural schemes located in nearby Swartberg, Franklin and Kransdraai, which meet the RDP level of service. Infrastructure and schooling Kokstad has many primary and secondary schools, as well as a tertiary institution college. Some of the main schooling institutions are as follows: * Carl Malcomess High * Mount Currie Senior Secondary School * Seven Fountains Primary School * Shayamoya High * Kokstad Public Primary * Kokstad Junior School * Kokstad Primary School * Kokstad College * St. Patricks College (both primary and secondary) * Esayidi TVET Collegehttp://esayidifet.co.za/ Kokstad also has two main hospitals that service the surrounding areas: * Kokstad Private Hospital * Usher Memorial Hospital (State Owned Hospital). Kokstad, as a fast growing community, has a few shopping centres, namely: * Rolyats Shopping Centre * Shoprite Centre * Rosewood Square Rolyats Shopping Centre This is one of the most popular shopping stops in town. It has Truworths, Identity, Mr Price, Elegant man, Total Sports and other clothing stores. There is a Spur, Wimpy, Romans Pizza, Nando's, and a 2020 addition of a McDonald's. Woolworths, Superspar and many other stores are available here for locals leisure. Coats of arms =Municipal (1)= By 1931, the Kokstad municipal council had assumed a pseudo-heraldic \\"coat of arms\\" depicting a landscape with Mount Currie in the background, ears of wheat, and a tree, and the motto Concilio et animis.The arms were depicted on a title=Category:UTC_South_African_town_arms cigarette card issued in 1931. =Municipal (2)= A proper coat of arms was designed by Ivan Mitford-Barberton in the late 1950s. It was registered with the Cape Provincial Administration in October 1960Cape of Good Hope Official Gazette 3052 (28 October 1960). and at the Bureau of Heraldry in July 1979.http://www.national.archsrch.gov.za The arms were : Per fess Gules and Or, in chief, dexter a Griqua hunter statant holding in his dexter hand a slain buck and in his sinister hand a rifle, sinister a lion statant, all Or; in base, below a yoke the barrel of a cannon palewise, all Sable; the whole within a bordure compony of 40 pieces Argent and Sable. In layman's terms, the shield was divided horizontally into red and gold, the upper half depicting a Griqua hunter holding a slain buck and a rifle and facing a lion, and the lower half a yoke above an upright black cannon barrel, the whole design surrounded by a border divided into forty sections alternately silver and black. The crest was a cock's head issuing from a golden eastern crown, and the motto was Pro rege lege et grege.  Literature  * Alan George Sumner Gibson: Eight Years in Kaffraria, 1882‚Äì1890.

It is located in the front of the neck and consists of two bellies separated by an intermediate tendon. Its superior belly serves as the most lateral member of the infrahyoid muscles, located lateral to both the sternothyroid and thyrohyoid muscles.Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, page 102 Its name derives from the Greek \\"omos\\" meaning shoulder, giving one of its attachments, and \\"hyoid\\", giving the other attachment ‚Äì the hyoid bone. Structure It arises from the upper border of the scapula, and occasionally from the superior transverse scapular ligament which crosses the scapular notch, its extent of attachment to the scapula varying from a few millimetres to 2.5 cm. This muscle has two separate bellies: superior and inferior. From this origin, the inferior belly forms a flat, narrow fasciculus, which inclines forward and slightly upward across the lower part of the neck, being bound down to the clavicle by a fibrous expansion; it then passes behind the sternocleidomastoid, becomes tendinous and changes its direction, forming an obtuse angle. It ends in the superior belly, which passes almost vertically upward, close to the lateral border of the sternohyoid, to be inserted into the lower border of the body of the hyoid bone, lateral to the insertion of the sternohyoid. The central tendon of this muscle varies much in length and form, and is held in position by a process of the deep cervical fascia, which sheaths it, and is prolonged down to be attached to the clavicle and first rib; it is by this means that the angular form of the muscle is maintained. The tendon overlies the internal jugular vein, and can be used as a landmark for this vein during surgery. =Variation= Doubling; absence; origin from clavicle; absence or doubling of either belly. Examination of the neck The inferior belly of the omohyoid divides the posterior triangle of the neck into an upper or occipital triangle and a lower or subclavian triangle. Its superior belly divides the anterior triangle into an upper or carotid triangle and a lower or muscular triangle.Human anatomy, Jacobs, Elsevier, 2008, page 189 The omohyoid muscle is proximally attached to the scapula and distally attached to the hyoid bone. =Innervation= The omohyoid is innervated by a branch of the cervical plexus, the ansa cervicalis, and mostly acts to stabilise the hyoid bone. The inferior belly of the omohyoid is innervated by the three cervical branches (C1-C3) that make up the ansa cervicalis, while the superior belly is innervated by the superior root of ansa cervicalis which contains only fibers from the first cervical spinal nerves (C1).

Friend the Colonial Secretary, who, of course, is responsible for the administration of the policy, will be considering later.\\" The policy, first drafted in March 1939, was prepared by the British government unilaterally as a result of the failure of the Arab-Zionist London Conference. The paper called for the establishment of a Jewish national home in an independent Palestinian state within 10 years, rejecting the Peel Commission's idea of partitioning Palestine. It also limited Jewish immigration to 75,000 for five years and ruled that further immigration would then be determined by the Arab majority (section II). Jews were restricted from buying Arab land in all but 5% of the Mandate (section III). The proposal did not meet the political demands proposed by Arab representatives during the London Conference and was officially rejected by the representatives of Palestine Arab parties, who were acting under the influence of Haj Amin Effendi al-Husseini, but the more moderate Arab opinion that was represented by the National Defence Party was prepared to accept the White Paper. Zionist groups in Palestine immediately rejected the White Paper and led a campaign of attacks on government property that lasted for several months. On 18 May, a Jewish general strike was called.A Survey of Palestine - prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo- American Committee of Inquiry.

Regulations on land transfers and clauses restricting immigration were implemented, but at the end of the five years in 1944, only 51,000 of the 75,000 immigration certificates provided for had been used. In light of this, the British offered to allow immigration to continue beyond the cutoff date of 1944, at a rate of 1,500 per month, until the remaining quota was filled.Study (30 June 1978): The Origins and Evolution of the Palestine Problem Part I: 1917-1947 - Study (30 June 1978), accessdate: November 10, 2018 From December 1945 to the 1948 end of the Mandate, 1,500 additional certificates for Jewish immigrants were allocated each month.

Facing the Arab Palestinians are the British, with Sir Neville Chamberlain presiding. To his right is Lord Halifax and to his left Malcolm MacDonald. During World War I, the British had made two promises regarding territory in the Middle East. Britain had promised the Hashemite governors of Arabia, through Lawrence of Arabia and the McMahon‚ÄìHussein Correspondence, independence for a united Arab country in Syria in exchange for supporting the British against the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Caliphate had declared a military jihad for the Germans, and the British hoped that an alliance with the Arabs would quell the chances of a general Muslim uprising in British-held territories in Africa, India and the Far East.King Husain and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press, 1979, , page 54 Britain had also negotiated the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement to partition the Middle East between Britain and France. A variety of strategic factors, such as securing Jewish support in Eastern Europe while the Russian front collapsed, culminated in the 1917 Balfour Declaration in which Britain promised to create and foster a Jewish national home in Palestine. The broad delineations of territory and goals for both the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and Arab self-determination were approved in the San Remo Conference. In June 1922, the League of Nations approved the Palestine Mandate, effective September 1923, an explicit document on Britain's responsibilities and powers of administration in Palestine, including 'secur[ing] the establishment of the Jewish national home', and 'safeguarding the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine'. In September 1922, the British government presented the Trans-Jordan memorandum to the League of Nations that stated that the Emirate of Transjordan would be excluded from all the provisions dealing with Jewish settlement, in accordance with Article 25 of the Mandate. The memorandum was approved on 23 September. Stiff Arab opposition and pressure against Jewish immigration made Britain redefine Jewish immigration by restricting its flow according to the country's economic capacity to absorb the immigrants. In effect, annual quotas were put in place as to how many Jews could immigrate, but Jews possessing a large sum of money (¬£500) were allowed to enter the country freely. Following Adolf Hitler's rise to power, European Jews were increasingly prepared to spend the money necessary to enter Palestine. The 1935 Nuremberg Laws stripped the 500,000 German Jews of their citizenship. Jewish migration was impeded by Nazi restrictions on the transfer of finances abroad (departing Jews had to abandon their property), but the Jewish Agency was able to negotiate an agreement that allowed Jews resident in Germany to buy German goods for export to Palestine, thus circumventing the restrictions. The large numbers of Jews entering Palestine was a cause of the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Britain responded to the revolt by appointing a royal commission, the Peel Commission, which went to Palestine and undertook a thorough study of the issues. The Peel Commission recommended in 1937 for Palestine to be partitioned into two states: one Arab the other Jewish. Vociferously rejected by the Arabs, accepted as a basis for future negotiations by the Jews, the Peel Commission failed to stem the violence. In January 1938, the Woodhead Commission explored the practicalities of partition and considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel Plan. Reporting in 1938, the Woodhead Commission rejected the plan, primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs, an option that the British government had already ruled out. With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but it emphasised serious problems with it such as a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab state. The British government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable for \\"political, administrative and financial difficulties\\".Statement by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty November, 1938. It proposed a substantially-smaller Jewish state, including the coastal plain only. The √âvian Conference, convened by the United States in July 1938, failed to find any agreement to deal with the rapidly growing number of Jewish refugees, increasing pressure on the British to find a solution to the problem of Jewish immigration to Palestine. =London Conference= In February 1939, the British called the London Conference to negotiate an agreement between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. The Arab delegates attended on the condition that they would not meet directly with the Jewish representatives, which would constitute recognition of Jewish claims over Palestine. The British government, therefore, held separate meetings with the two sides. The conference ended in failure on March 17.Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry - Appendix IV Palestine: Historical Background In the wake of World War II, the British believed that Jewish support was either guaranteed or unimportant. However, the government feared hostility from the Arab world.

Content Land classification and boundaries of land transfer regions as prescribed in 1940. These were the main points of the White Paper: *Section I. The Constitution: It stated that with over 450,000 Jews having now settled in the mandate, the Balfour Declaration about \\"a national home for the Jewish people\\" had been met, and it also called for an independent Palestine to be established within 10 years and to be governed jointly by Arabs and Jews: > His Majesty's Government believe that the framers of the Mandate in which > the Balfour Declaration was embodied could not have intended that Palestine > should be converted into a Jewish State against the will of the Arab > population of the country. [ ... ] His Majesty's Government therefore now > declare unequivocally that it is not part of their policy that Palestine > should become a Jewish State. They would indeed regard it as contrary to > their obligations to the Arabs under the Mandate, as well as to the > assurances which have been given to the Arab people in the past, that the > Arab population of Palestine should be made the subjects of a Jewish State > against their will. > The objective of His Majesty's Government is the establishment within 10 > years of an independent Palestine State in such treaty relations with the > United Kingdom as will provide satisfactorily for the commercial and > strategic requirements of both countries in the future. [..] The independent > State should be one in which Arabs and Jews share government in such a way > as to ensure that the essential interests of each community are safeguarded. *Section II. Immigration: Jewish immigration to Palestine under the British Mandate was to be limited to 75,000 over the next five years and then would depend on Arab consent: > His Majesty's Government do not [..] find anything in the Mandate or in > subsequent Statements of Policy to support the view that the establishment > of a Jewish National Home in Palestine cannot be effected unless immigration > is allowed to continue indefinitely. If immigration has an adverse effect on > the economic position in the country, it should clearly be restricted; and > equally, if it has a seriously damaging effect on the political position in > the country, that is a factor that should not be ignored. Although it is not > difficult to contend that the large number of Jewish immigrants who have > been admitted so far have been absorbed economically, the fear of the Arabs > that this influx will continue indefinitely until the Jewish population is > in a position to dominate them has produced consequences which are extremely > grave for Jews and Arabs alike and for the peace and prosperity of > Palestine. The lamentable disturbances of the past three years are only the > latest and most sustained manifestation of this intense Arab apprehension [ > ... ] it cannot be denied that fear of indefinite Jewish immigration is > widespread amongst the Arab population and that this fear has made possible > disturbances which have given a serious setback to economic progress, > depleted the Palestine exchequer, rendered life and property insecure, and > produced a bitterness between the Arab and Jewish populations which is > deplorable between citizens of the same country. If in these circumstances > immigration is continued up to the economic absorptive capacity of the > country, regardless of all other considerations, a fatal enmity between the > two peoples will be perpetuated, and the situation in Palestine may become a > permanent source of friction amongst all peoples in the Near and Middle > East. > Jewish immigration during the next five years will be at a rate which, if > economic absorptive capacity permits, will bring the Jewish population up to > approximately one third of the total population of the country. Taking into > account the expected natural increase of the Arab and Jewish populations, > and the number of illegal Jewish immigrants now in the country, this would > allow of the admission, as from the beginning of April this year, of some > 75,000 immigrants over the next four years. These immigrants would, subject > to the criterion of economic absorptive capacity, be admitted as follows: > For each of the next five years a quota of 10,000 Jewish immigrants will be > allowed on the understanding that a shortage one year may be added to the > quotas for subsequent years, within the five-year period, if economic > absorptive capacity permits. In addition, as a contribution towards the > solution of the Jewish refugee problem, 25,000 refugees will be admitted as > soon as the High Commissioner is satisfied that adequate provision for their > maintenance is ensured, special consideration being given to refugee > children and dependents. The existing machinery for ascertaining economic > absorptive capacity will be retained, and the High Commissioner will have > the ultimate responsibility for deciding the limits of economic capacity. > Before each periodic decision is taken, Jewish and Arab representatives will > be consulted. After the period of five years, no further Jewish immigration > will be permitted unless the Arabs of Palestine are prepared to acquiesce in > it. *Section III. Land: No restriction had been imposed on the transfer of land from Arabs to Jews, but the White Paper now stated: > The Reports of several expert Commissions have indicated that, owing to the > natural growth of the Arab population and the steady sale in recent years of > Arab land to Jews, there is now in certain areas no room for further > transfers of Arab land, whilst in some other areas such transfers of land > must be restricted if Arab cultivators are to maintain their existing > standard of life and a considerable landless Arab population is not soon to > be created. In these circumstances, the High Commissioner will be given > general powers to prohibit and regulate transfers of land.

Jewish demonstration against White Paper in Tel Aviv, 1939, from the collection of the National Library of Israel. =Parliamentary approval= On 22 May 1939, the House of Commons debated a motion that the White Paper was inconsistent with the terms of the Mandate, but it was defeated by 268 votes to 179. The following day, the House of Lords accepted the new policy without a vote.A Survey of Palestine - prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo- American Committee of Inquiry. Reprinted 1991 by The Institute of Palestine Studies, Washington. Volume one. . p.54. During the debate, Lloyd George called the White Paper an \\"act of perfidy\\", and Winston Churchill voted against his party although it was in the government. The Liberal MP James Rothschild stated during the parliamentary debate that \\"for the majority of the Jews who go to Palestine it is a question of migration or of physical extinction\\".House of Commons Debates, Volume 347 column 1984 Some supporters of the government were opposed to the policy on the grounds that it appeared in their view to contradict the Balfour Declaration. Several government MPs voted against the proposals or abstained, including Cabinet Ministers such as the illustrious Jewish Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha. =League of Nations= The Permanent Mandates Commission unanimously held that the White Paper was in conflict with the interpretation that the Mandatory Government, with the concurrence of the organs of the League, had put upon the mandate in the past. Four of the members felt that the policy was not in harmony with the terms of the Mandate, and the other three held that existing circumstances would justify the policy if the Council of the League of Nations did not oppose it. The outbreak of the Second World War suspended any further deliberations. =Arab Reactions= The Arab Higher Committee initially argued that the independence of a future Palestine government would prove to be illusory since the Jews could prevent its functioning by withholding participation, and in any case, real authority would still be in the hands of British officials. The limitations on Jewish immigration were also held to be insufficient since there was no guarantee immigration would not resume after five years. In place of the policy enunciated in the White Paper, the Arab Higher Committee called for \\"a complete and final prohibition\\" of Jewish immigration and a repudiation of the Jewish national home policy altogether. In June 1939, Hajj Amin al-Husayni initially \\"astonished\\" the other members of the Arab Higher Committee by turning down the White Paper. According to Benny Morris, the reason that the advantageous proposal was turned down was entirely selfish: \\"it did not place him at the helm of the future Palestinian state.\\"Morris, Benny, \\"The Tangled Truth\\", The New Republic, May '07, '08 In July 1940, after two weeks of meetings with the British representative, S. F. Newcombe, the leader of the Palestinian Arab delegates to the London Conference, Jamal al-Husseini and fellow delegate Musa al-Alami, agreed to the terms of the White Paper, and both signed a copy of it in the presence of the prime minister of Iraq, Nuri as-Said.Buheiry, Marwan R. (1989) The Formation and Perception of the Modern Arab World. Studies by Marwan R Buheiry. Edited by Lawrence I. Conrad. Darwin Press, Princeton. . p.177 =Zionists= Zionist groups in Palestine immediately rejected the White Paper and began a campaign of attacks on government property and Arab civilians, which lasted for several months. On 18 May, a Jewish general strike was called. On 27 February 1939, in response to enthusiastic Arab demonstrations after reports that the British were proposing to allow independence to Palestine on the same terms as Iraq, a co-ordinated Irgun bombing campaign across the country killed 38 Arabs and wounded 44.Kayyali, Abdul-Wahhab Said (no date) Palestine. A Modern History Croom Helm. . p.221. In response to the White Paper, the right-wing Zionist militant group Irgun began formulating plans for a rebellion to evict the British and to establish an independent Jewish state. Ze'ev Jabotinsky, the founder of Irgun, who had been exiled from Palestine by the British, proposed a plan for a revolt to take place in October 1939, which he sent to the Irgun High Command in six coded letters. Jabotinsky's plan, he and other \\"illegals\\" would start by arriving in Palestine by boat. Then, the Irgun would help him and the other passengers escape. Next, the Irgun would raid and occupy Government House and other British centres of power in Palestine, raise the Jewish national flag and hold them for at least 24 hours, even at a heavy cost. Simultaneously, Zionist leaders in Western Europe and the United States would proclaim an independent Jewish state in Palestine and function as a government-in-exile. Irgun seriously considered carrying out the plan but was concerned over the heavy losses that would be inevitable. Irgun leader Avraham Stern, who would later break from Irgun to form Lehi, formed a plan for 40,000 armed Jewish fighters recruited in Europe to sail to Palestine and join the rebellion. The Polish government supported his plan and began training Jews and setting aside weaponry for them. However, the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 quickly put an end to those plans.Zev Golan: Free Jerusalem: Heroes, Heroines and Rogues who Created the State of IsraelPenkower, Monty Noam: Decision on Palestine Deferred: America, Britain and Wartime Diplomacy, 1939-1945 After the outbreak of war in September 1939, the head of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, David Ben-Gurion declared, \\"We will fight the White Paper as if there is no war, and fight the war as if there is no White Paper.\\"The Brigade by Howard Blum, p.5. In 1946, a Yiddish song published in Yishuv by Jacob Jacobs ad Isadore Lilian included these lyrics: Tserisn muz vern dos vayse papir, In der fremd viln mir mer nit zayn.

The reason given was the increase in the number of illegal immigrants.Survey. p.56. In March 1940, the British High Commissioner for Palestine issued an edict dividing Palestine into three zones: > In Zone A, consisting of about 63 percent of the country including the stony > hills, land transfers save to a Palestinian Arab were in general forbidden. > In Zone B. consisting of about 32 percent of the country, transfers from a > Palestinian Arab save to another Palestinian Arab were severely restricted > at the discretion of the High Commissioner. In the remainder of Palestine, > consisting of about five percent of the country-which, however, includes the > most fertile areas‚Äîland sales remained unrestricted.Anglo-American Committee > of Inquiry ‚Äì Appendix IV, copy at In December 1942, when the extermination of the Jews became public knowledge, there were 34,000 immigration certificates remaining. In February 1943, the British government announced that the remaining certificates could be used as soon as practicable to rescue Jewish children from Do Southeastern Europe, particularly Bulgaria. This plan was partly successful, but many of those who received certificates were not able to emigrate although those in Bulgaria survived.Ofer, Dalia, Escaping the Holocaust (1990) pages 218ff, 290. In July, it was announced that any Jewish refugee who reached a neutral country in transit would be given clearance for Palestine.Ofer, Dalia, Escaping the Holocaust (1990) page 219 During 1943 about half the remaining certificates were distributed,Ofer, Dalia, Escaping the Holocaust (1990) page 290 and by the end of the war, there were 3,000 certificates left.Ovendale, R, \\"The Palestine Policy of the British Labour Government 1945‚Äì1946\\", International Affairs, Vol. 55, pages 409‚Äì431. At the end of World War II, the British Labour Party conference voted to rescind the White Paper and to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, but the party's Foreign Minister, Ernest Bevin, persisted with the policy, which remained in effect until the May 1948 British departure from Palestine. After the war, the determination of Holocaust survivors to reach Palestine led to large scale illegal Jewish migration to Palestine. British efforts to block the migration led to violent resistance by the Zionist underground. Illegal immigrants detained by the British Government were interned in camps on Cyprus. The immigrants had no citizenship and could not be returned to any country. Those interned included a large number of children and orphans. Immigration statistics compiled in December 1945 indicated that the White Paper allowance had been exceeded by 790 persons when illegal immigrants were included.Supplement to Survey of Palestine, June 1947, pages 15ff On January 31, 1946, the High Commissioner announced: > It will be recalled that in the Statement of the Secretary of State for > Foreign Affairs of November 13, 1945, it was made clear that His Majesty's > Government could not divest themselves of the duties and responsibilities > under the Mandate while the Mandate continued. They therefore proposed that > they would consult with the Arabs with a view to an arrangement which would > ensure that pending the receipt of the interim recommendations of the > [Anglo-American] Committee of Inquiry there would be no interruption of > Jewish immigration at the present monthly rate. These consultations with the > Arabs have been proceeding over a long period and have reached no conclusive > result. In these circumstances His Majesty's Government have now decided for > cogent reasons that they must allow immigration to continue provisionally at > the proposed rate of 1,500 a month. Preference will be given to those > European Jews who have a special claim such as those to whom the Palestine > Government have already undertaken obligations, and relatives in Europe of > Jews already established in Palestine. Illegal immigrants will of course, > continue to be deducted from quotas. The quota of 1,500 certificates for Jewish immigrants per month continued until the end of the mandate.The Palestine Gazette, No. 1661, 15th April 1948, Supplement 2, page 578. The Provisional Council of Israel's first constitutional act was a Proclamation that \\"All legislation resulting from the British Government's White Paper of May, 1939, will at midnight tonight become null and void.

The script is written by Bi Feiyu based on Li Xiao's 1994 novel Rules of a Clan (Èó®ËßÑ). The film is set in the criminal underworld of 1930s Shanghai, Republic of China and spans seven days. Shanghai Triad's Chinese title reads \\"Row, row, row to Grandma Bridge\\", refers to a well known traditional Chinese lullaby. The film was the last collaboration between Zhang Yimou and actress Gong Li in the 1990s, thus ending a successful partnership that had begun with Zhang's debut, Red Sorghum, and had evolved into a romantic relationship as well. With the wrapping of filming for Shanghai Triad the two agreed to end their relationship both professionally and personally. Gong Li and Zhang Yimou would not work together again until 2006's Curse of the Golden Flower. Plot Tang Shuisheng (Wang Xiaoxiao) has arrived in Shanghai to work for a Triad Boss (played by Li Baotian), also named Tang. He is taken to a warehouse where two rival groups of Triads carry out an opium deal that goes wrong, leaving one of the rival members dead. Shuisheng is then taken by his uncle to Tang's palatial home, where he is assigned to serve Xiao Jinbao (Gong Li), a cabaret singer and mistress of the Boss. It is soon learned that Jinbao is also carrying on an affair with the Boss's number two man, Song (Sun Chun). On the third night, Shuisheng witnesses a bloody gang fight between the Boss and a rival, Fat Yu, in which his uncle is killed. The Boss and a small entourage retreat to an island. There, Jinbao befriends Cuihua (Jiang Baoying), a peasant woman with a young daughter, Ajiao. When Jinbao unwittingly meddles in Cuihua's business, it results in the Boss's men killing Cuihua's lover. Furious, Jinbao confronts the Boss and tells Shuisheng to leave Shanghai. By the seventh day, Song arrives to the island along with Zheng (Fu Biao), the Boss's number three man. During a mahjong game, the Boss calmly confronts Song with evidence of his treachery. The gang kills Song's men and buries Song alive. The Boss then informs Jinbao that she will have to die as well for her role in Song's betrayal, along with Cuihua. As Shuisheng attempts to save her from her fate, he is thrown back and beaten. The film ends with Shuisheng tied to the sails of the ship as it sails back to Shanghai. The Boss takes Cuihua's young daughter with him, telling her that in a few years, she will become just like Jinbao.  Cast  * Wang Xiaoxiao as Tang Shuisheng, the young teenage boy who serves as the film's protagonist and he falls under the spell of the boss's mistress, Jinbao. * Gong Li as Xiao Jinbao, a Shanghai nightclub singer, Jinbao is the mistress of the Triad Boss. * Li Xuejian as Uncle Liu, a servant to a Triad organization and Tang Shuisheng's uncle. * Li Baotian as Tang the Triad Boss who hides a ruthless side. * Sun Chun as Song, the Boss's number two man, Song's affair with Jinbao sets up the film's main conflict. * Fu Biao as Zheng, the Boss's number three man. * Yang Qianguan as Ajiao, a young girl living on the secluded island with her mother. * Jiang Baoying as Cuihao, Ajiao's mother, a peasant woman who prepares meals for the Boss while he is hiding on his island estate.  Production  Shanghai Triad was director Zhang Yimou's seventh feature film. Zhang's previous film, To Live had landed the director in trouble with Chinese authorities, and he was temporarily banned from making any films funded from overseas sources. Shanghai Triad was therefore only allowed to continue production after it was officially categorized as local production. The director has since noted that his selection of Shanghai Triad to follow up the politically controversial To Live was no accident, as he hoped that a \\"gangster movie\\" would be a conventional film. The film was originally intended to be a straight adaptation of the novel Gang Law by author Li Xiao. This plan eventually changed with Gong Li's character becoming more important and the story's viewpoint shifting to that of the young boy, Tang Shuisheng. As a result, the film's title was changed to reflect its new \\"younger\\" perspective. Reception Though perhaps less well known than some of Zhang Yimou's more celebrated films (notably Ju Dou, To Live and Raise the Red Lantern), Shanghai Triad was nevertheless generally praised by critics upon its release, with a 90% \\"fresh\\" rating on the review-database, Rotten Tomatoes from 29 reviews. With its headline position in the New York Film Festival, The New York Times' critic Janet Maslin opened her review that despite the clich√©d genre of the \\"gangster film,\\" Shanghai Triad nevertheless \\"movingly affirms the magnitude of [Zhang Yimou's] storytelling power.\\" Derek Elley of the entertainment magazine Variety similarly found the film to be an achievement, particularly in how it played with genre conventions, calling the film a \\"stylized but gripping portrait of mob power play and lifestyles in 1930 Shanghai.\\" Roger Ebert, however, provided a counterpoint to the film's praise, arguing that the choice of the boy as the film's main protagonist ultimately hurt the film, and that Shanghai Triad was probably \\"the last, and ... certainly the least, of the collaborations between the Chinese director Zhang Yimou and the gifted actress Gong Li\\" (though Gong would again work with Zhang in 2006's Curse of the Golden Flower). Even Ebert however, conceded that the film's technical credits were well done, calling Zhang one of the \\"best visual stylists of current cinema.\\" =Awards and nominations= * Cannes Film Festival (1995) **Technical Grand Prize * Camerimage Awards (1995) **Golden Frog ‚Äî L√º Yue (nominated) * Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards (1995) ** LAFCA Award, Best Cinematography ‚Äî L√º Yue * New York Film Critics Circle Awards (1995) ** NYFCC Award, Best Cinematography ‚Äî L√º Yue * National Board of Review (1995) ** NBR Award, Best Foreign Language Film * 53rd Golden Globe Awards (1996) ** Golden Globe, Best Foreign Language Film (nominated) * 68th Academy Awards (1996) ** Best Cinematography ‚Äî L√º Yue (nominated)  DVD release  Shanghai Triad was released on December 12, 2000 in the United States on region 1 DVD by Sony Pictures' Columbia TriStar label.

While the subg. Acacia and subg. Phyllodinae are monophyletic, subg. Aculeiferum is not. This subgenus consists of three clades. Therefore, the following list of Acacia species cannot be maintained as a single entity, and must either be split up, or broadened to include species previously not in the genus. This genus has been provisionally divided into 5 genera, Acacia, Vachellia, Senegalia, Acaciella and Mariosousa. The proposed type species of Acacia is Acacia penninervis. Which of these segregate genera is to retain the name Acacia has been controversial. The genus was previously typified with the African species Acacia scorpioides (L.)

History Rogozen Treasure ‚Äì the biggest Thracian treasure that was ever discovered on the territory of Bulgaria Vratsa - panoramic view Vratsa is an ancient city found by ancient Thracians. Vratsa was called Valve (\\"door of a fortress\\") by the Romans due to a narrow passage where the main gate of the city fortress was located. Nowadays, this passage is the symbol of Vratsa, and is shown on the town's Coat of arms. After the fall of Rome, Vratsa became part of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium). At the end of the 6th century AD, Vratsa was populated by the South Slavic tribes. Even if they came from Pannonia and Dacia on the north, the town remained under Byzantine rule. In the 7th century, the Bulgars and the Slavs found the First Bulgarian Empire and the Slavic Vratsa became part of it. The city grew into important strategic location because of its proximity to the South State border. Vratsa became famous for its goldsmiths and silversmiths production and trade, high- quality earthenware and military significance. In the 8th century, the Bulgarian army captured Sofia, which led to the decreasing of Vratsa's importance because of the better strategic position of Sofia, its more developed economy and larger size. But Vratsa was again key for the resistance against the Byzantine, Serbian and Magyar invasions in the Middle Ages. On 1 May 1966 in the village of Sgorigrad , a Mir-Plakanista mine tailings dam collapsed, causing a flood of mud and debris that killed 488 people.It remains one of the biggest disasters in Vratsa since the Semtepber 30, 1923 fire and the Anglo-American bombing of January 23, 1944.

Category:Populated places in Vratsa Province ","title":"Vratsa"},{"id":"894713","text":"The Osmonds are an American family music group who reached the height of their fame in the early to mid- 1970s. Currently consisting of a duo of original members Merrill Osmond and Jay Osmond, the group had its best-known configurations as a quartet (billed as the Osmond Brothers) and a quintet (as the Osmonds). The group has comprised siblings who are all members of a family of musicians from Ogden, Utah and have been in the public eye since the 1960s. The Osmond Brothers began as a barbershop quartet consisting of brothers Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay. They were later joined by younger siblings Donny and Jimmy, both of whom enjoyed success as solo artists. With the addition of Donny, the group became known as the Osmonds; performing both as teen idols and as a soft rock band, their peak lasted from 1971 to 1975. Their only sister Marie, who rarely sang with her brothers at that time, launched a successful career in 1973, both as a solo artist and as Donny's duet partner. By 1976, the band was no longer producing hit singles; that year, they transitioned into television with Donny & Marie, a popular variety show that ran until 1979. A revival of the original Osmond Brothers lineup in the 1980s achieved moderate success in country music, and both Donny and Marie separately made comebacks in their respective fields in the late-1980s. The Osmonds have sold over 100 million records worldwide. Much of their body of work has largely been forgotten among the general public in the United States, since radio stations have largely excluded their music from classic hits and oldies playlists. The quartet continued to perform through their 50th anniversary in 2007, at which point Alan and later Wayne retired due to health issues; Jimmy was recruited after Alan's retirement, with the group performing as a trio until Jimmy suffered a stroke and retired in 2018. Alan's son David Osmond performed with the group in 2019. On October 14, 2019, the original Osmond Brothers quartet reunited for CBS' The Talk for their sister Marie's 60th birthday, billed as the last ever appearance for the lineup. The brothers performed \\"The Last Chapter,\\" written as a farewell song and introduced in 2018. Donny & Marie ended an 11-year Las Vegas residency on November 16, 2019. Merrill and Jay continue to perform and tour,Osmondmania: the Latter-day Saint family who took the UK by storm as musical missionaries as does Donny as a solo artist. Early careers George Virl Osmond, Sr. and Olive Osmond, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, resided in Ogden, Utah. They bore nine children: Virl, Tom, Alan, Wayne, Merrill, Jay, Donny, Marie, and Jimmy. Virl and Tom have both had severe hearing impairment since birth.Biography: The Osmonds, Pure and Simple (documentary) The Osmond Brothers' career began in 1958 when Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay began singing barbershop music for local audiences in and around Ogden. In their made-for-TV movie Inside the Osmonds, they explain that they originally performed to earn money to support Virl and Tom in buying hearing aids and serving missions for the church.\\"Inside the Osmonds\\" (DVD) Despite their young ages (Alan was 9, Wayne 7, Merrill 5, and Jay 3) and within a few years, the boys' talent and stage presence were strong enough that their father, George Osmond, took them to audition for Lawrence Welk in California.

Tommy Walker, Disneyland's Director of Entertainment and Customer Relations from 1955 to 1966, found the Osmond Brothers singing with the Dapper Dans on Main Street.The Unofficial Disneyland 1955 Companion: The Anecdotal Story of the Birth of The Happiest Place on Earth, Jim Korkis, 2016 Walker hired the Osmonds to perform on a segment of Disneyland After Dark.

From left: Alan, Wayne, Williams, Merrill and Jay. While the Osmond Brothers were performing on a televised Disney special, Disneyland After Dark, Andy Williams's father saw them and was so impressed he told his son to book them for his television show. Andy did, and the Osmond Brothers were regulars on the show from 1962 to 1969, where they earned the nickname \\"one-take Osmonds\\" among staff due to their professionalism and tireless rehearsing.Life is Just What You Make It: My Story So Far by Donny Osmond and Patricia Romanowski Donny soon joined them on the show, making the Osmond Brothers a 5-member group. Marie and Jimmy were also introduced on the show as the years went by. During this time, the Osmonds also toured Europe, performing with Sweden's most popular singer, Lars L√∂nndahl, and even releasing a single where they sang a Swedish version of \\"Two Dirty Little Hands\\" (\\"Fem smutsiga sm√• fingrar\\"). The Andy Williams Show ended its first run in 1967, after which the Osmond Brothers were signed to The Jerry Lewis Show, staying with that show until it was canceled (and, coincidentally, The Andy Williams Show returned for a second run) in 1969. but soon decided they wanted to perform popular music and shed their variety-show image. They wanted to become a rock and roll band. The change was a difficult one for their father, who was suspicious of rock and roll, but he was persuaded and the boys began performing as a pop band. To this end, the Osmonds recorded a single, \\"Flower Music\\" \\"I Can't Stop,\\" for UNI records in 1967.Osmondmania (official Osmond website) captured 10/20/2012 They achieved only modest success at first, but they found fame in 1971. Pop and rock era =Bubblegum: Osmonds and Homemade= Record producer Mike Curb saw the Osmonds perform as a band and recognized that they combined a rare mix of polished performing style, instrumental skill, and vocal talent. He helped the Osmonds get a record contract with MGM Records and arranged for them to record at Muscle Shoals with R&B; producer Rick Hall. Under Hall's guidance, the Osmonds hit the top spot on the pop chart with \\"One Bad Apple\\" in 1971. The song, \\"One Bad Apple\\", written by George Jackson, who had the Jackson Five in mind when he wrote it, was originally presented to Motown executive Berry Gordy for the Jackson Five to record but he turned it down. It was then presented to MGM Records for the Osmonds, and it became their first number-one hit single, released on November 14, 1970. The Osmonds soon had hits with other light, R&B-style; pop numbers like \\"Double Lovin'\\" (#14) and \\"Yo-Yo\\" (#3). In each of these hits, the formula was the same; Merrill sang lead, and Donny was \\"co-lead\\" in essence, singing the \\"hook\\" or \\"chorus\\" of the song. At this time the Osmonds also recorded several hits that were billed to Donny, the lead soloist on the songs: \\"Sweet and Innocent\\" (#7), \\"Go Away Little Girl\\" (#1), \\"I Knew You When\\" (#9) and \\"Puppy Love\\" (#2). With the Osmonds having finally broken through, Uni Records re-released their 1967 single, this time with \\"I Can't Stop\\" as the A-side, where it reached number 96. Since the transition to pop stars required more elaborate choreography than most barbershop quartets had required, older brother Virl Osmond taught the quintet how to dance. Virl was estimated to hear about 15% of what most people can hear, good enough to follow a rhythm. =Transition to rock: Phase III and Crazy Horses= The Osmonds began writing and performing their own music and their sound moved towards rock music beginning with their album Phase III. In addition to \\"Yo-Yo\\", Phase III produced the major hit \\"Down by the Lazy River\\" (#4). The following Crazy Horses album was the band's first really personal statement ‚Äì the brothers have been quoted as saying that the title song refers to air pollution from cars, and its instrumentation featured an even harder rock sound bordering on early heavy metal. They wrote all the songs and played all the instruments with Alan on rhythm guitar, Wayne on lead guitar, Merrill on lead vocals and bass, Jay on drums and Donny on keyboards. All the brothers sang backing vocals, with Jay and Donny sometimes singing lead parts. But Donny singing co-lead on these songs was abandoned for the reason given below (except for \\"Lazy River\\", which he also did not sing co-lead on). With their clean-cut image, talent, and energetic pop-rock sound, the Osmonds toured to crowds of screaming fans in the US. They even had their own 1972‚Äì1973 Saturday-morning cartoon series, The Osmonds, on ABC-TV. By this time, the Osmonds had broken through in the UK as well: counting group and solo recordings, members of the Osmond family charted 13 singles on the UK charts during 1973. Some observers coined a new word, \\"Osmondmania\\", to describe the phenomenon, by analogy with the similar \\"Beatlemania\\" of the previous decade. In early 1972, fourteen year old Donny's voice had changed. This was a major upset to the group's formula that had proved so successful. Not only did this eliminate Merrill's young-sounding co-lead's voice (forcing Merrill's already mature tenor voice to strain to cover most of the higher notes, with audible difficulty, through the next few years), but it also ended Donny's bubble gum like ballads, which became so popular with fans. With this development, Donny spent much of 1972 and then 1973 touring with his brothers but singing his old songs with his new voice, although the success of Crazy Horses singles \\"Hold Her Tight\\" (#14) and title track \\"Crazy Horses\\" (on which Donny did not sing) kept the group very popular through 1973. =Emergence as teen balladeers: The Plan and Love Me for a Reason= The older male Osmonds were of age to go on church missions, yet they believed they could reach more people through their music. They recorded an ambitious album in 1973 called The Plan, perhaps best described as a Mormon concept album with progressive rock aspirations. One reviewer suggested that The Plan carried a too-strong religious message‚ÄîMormonism is, after all, fairly conservative and not usually associated with the themes of rock-and-roll. He likewise suggested that the music was too varied and experimental.[ ] The album produced only two minor hits: \\"Let Me In\\" and \\"Goin' Home\\" (both #36 in the USA, although they both went top 5 in the UK and \\"Let Me In\\" was also a major hit on the easy listening charts). Furthermore, the older boys may have wanted to reduce the regular touring that is a necessity in popular music but not so good for marriage; Alan, Wayne and Merrill would all marry their wives in 1973 and 1974 (Donny married in 1978; Jay would not marry until 1987). But The Plan was a major departure from the pop music which made them so popular. The combination of this album, along with Donny's voice change the year before, meant that with young fans the Osmonds' popularity would soon wane. Another major factor in the band's decline was the sheer diversity of its output: within three years, the Osmonds had waffled between bubblegum pop, hard rock, and easy listening, and Donny's solo career as an oldies cover artist further muddled the band's direction. Donny's collaboration with Steve and Eydie, \\"We Can Make it Together\\" (billed as featuring all of the Osmonds as Alan, Wayne and Merrill had penned the track for Donny), came out on the easy listening charts at the same time the much harder \\"Crazy Horses\\" song was charting. =Donny's solo career, and the emergence of Marie and Jimmy as spin-off acts= Donny, and to a lesser extent, Marie and Jimmy, soon began to emerge as solo artists. Jimmy was becoming \\"big in Japan\\", and in 1972 had a #1 hit in the United Kingdom with \\"Long Haired Lover from Liverpool\\". Marie, then 13 years old, hit #1 on the US country chart in 1973 with \\"Paper Roses\\" (a song originally recorded by Anita Bryant a decade before). Donny had a string of pop hits with a string of covers of earlier teen-pop songs, including \\"Go Away Little Girl\\" (#1, originally by Steve Lawrence), \\"Puppy Love\\" (#3, a Paul Anka composition) and \\"The Twelfth of Never\\" (#8, originally recorded by Johnny Mathis). From 1971 to 1976, he had 12 Top 40 hits, including 5 in the Top 10; for most of these, the Osmonds were still performing as a full band, but backing and giving star billing to Donny for songs on which he sang lead. Donny's numerous solo hits have led many to assume he was the group's lead. Merrill was usually the lead singer; Donny would usually sing the choruses on songs billed to the Osmonds, thus being a \\"co-lead\\". (All five members of the group sang lead at various times; Jay would sing lead on some of the group's harder rock tunes, while Alan and Wayne would occasionally contribute a lead vocal on some album tracks.) Donny's emergence as a solo star and the record company's desire to appeal to the teen-girl audience often thrust Donny out in front of the group. By now the family was touring, recording, creating and producing for five technically separate artists: The Osmonds, Donny Osmond, Marie Osmond and Jimmy Osmond ‚Äî plus Donny and Marie had begun recording duets and had hits with \\"I'm Leaving It Up to You\\" (#4) and \\"Morning Side of the Mountain\\" (#8). Through all the stress and pressures created by these many efforts, the family hung together. The 2001 ABC-TV movie Inside the Osmonds depicts the family mottoes as being \\"It doesn't matter who's out front, as long as it's an Osmond\\" and \\"family, faith, and career. In that order\\". The original Osmonds as a group still produced hits. In 1974, \\"Love Me for a Reason\\" reached #10 in the US and #1 in the UK. The Irish boy band Boyzone took the song to #2 in the UK in 1994. =Fall from pop prominence: The Proud One and Brainstorm= Donny and Marie, 1977 By 1976, though, the group's record sales were softening; Osmondmania had long faded and been replaced by \\"Rollermania\\", as the Bay City Rollers became the hot pop band of choice in the mid-1970s. Their 1975 album The Proud One sold poorly (despite the title track providing a chart-topping easy listening hit and the group's last U.S. top-40 hit to date), and MGM Records was sold to PolyGram. Their first album on the subsidiary label Polydor was the album Brainstorm; that album sold only slightly better than its predecessor, and its lead single, \\"I Can't Live a Dream\\", fell short of the top 40. Polydor would release two more albums from the family (a Christmas album that included all of the performing family members, and a greatest hits compilation). Television era The Osmonds poured themselves into a new venture: the older brothers began producing The Donny & Marie Show which was a hit on ABC from 1976‚Äì1979. But the success came at a cost. The family built and operated at great expense a first-class television studio in Orem, Utah, where the show was produced beginning in 1977. As a result, the Osmonds as a performing band became a lower priority to Donny and Marie. The older brothers deferred or gave up their dreams of being a rock-and-roll band, although Donny and Marie as a duo continued to record hits into 1978; in an interview with The Lost 45s, Wayne Osmond suggested their abandonment of songwriting and working on material during the TV run may have been a mistake, as their career never recovered from the hiatus. Donny experienced stage anxiety and Marie had a brief bout with an eating disorder after a network executive told her she looked heavy. When the show was cancelled in 1979, the Osmonds were taken by surprise, as they had believed that the show would be renewed, and found themselves in debt and without a clear direction. The group switched from Polydor to corporate affiliate Mercury Records and attempted another album, Steppin' Out, which was a major failure with neither the album nor any of its singles charting anywhere; it would be their only album on that label. Steppin' Out was a transitional album for the Osmonds and was produced under the auspices of Maurice Gibb; among its tracks was the first recorded version of \\"Rest Your Love on Me\\", a country song that would become a hit for Gibb's own group, the Bee Gees, and topped the country charts in a cover version by Conway Twitty. Goin' Coconuts, a film produced by the Osmonds as a musical for Donny and Marie, was a major critical and commercial flop, although its lead track \\"On the Shelf\\" reached the top 40. They produced two unsuccessful projects for Marie, a sitcom pilot that never aired and a variety show revival that lasted seven episodes in 1980 and 1981. Donny permanently separated from the group (and, for a time, from Marie) shortly thereafter. They recovered and eventually paid their debts and re-established their careers. Rather than go into bankruptcy, they resolved to honor all of their financial obligations. But the Osmond artists and enterprises began operating separately. Later careers The Osmonds performed together in 1981 at The Front Row Theatre in Highland Heights, Ohio. This included all the brothers as well as Donny, Marie and Jimmy. Jay Osmond is the primary choreographer for the Osmonds‚Äô concerts and some television concerts. Jimmy worked as a businessman and manager. He eventually moved to Branson, Missouri, and opened the Osmond Family Theater, where he and his brothers performed until 2002. They appear in Branson during the Christmas season. Marie recorded a number of successful duets with Donny and continued to sing country music; she had several Top 40 country hits in the mid-1980s, the biggest of which was \\"Meet Me in Montana\\" with Dan Seals (#1). She starred in the Broadway revivals of the musicals The King and I (as the lead, Anna) and The Sound of Music (as the lead, Maria) in the mid-1990s. She returned to television first in the short-lived 1995 ABC sitcom Maybe This Time and then with Donny in 1998 to co-host Donny & Marie, a talk- entertainment show that lasted two seasons. Marie suffered from postpartum depression and wanted to help other women who suffered from it. In 2001 Marie, Marcia Wilkie and Dr. Judith Moore wrote a book on postpartum depression titled, Marie Osmond Behind the Smile. Marie remarried her first husband Stephen Craig in 2011. She was able to wear the same wedding dress after 26 years. Donny returned to the pop music scene in 1989; when he released \\"Soldier of Love\\" to much success in the UK, American music industry insiders were wary of the Osmond brand and promoted the song as being by a \\"mystery artist\\". The song became a turntable hit in this manner, and when Osmond's identity as the mystery artist was revealed, \\"Soldier of Love\\" eventually rose to number 2 on the US charts and was enough of a success to warrant a follow- up single, \\"Sacred Emotion\\", which peaked at number 13. He performed on Broadway as Gaston in the stage production of Beauty and the Beast, and also gave over 2,000 performances as Joseph in the touring production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He has hosted games shows in the US and UK (most notably the 2002‚Äì2004 revival of Pyramid and the British version of Identity), continues to appear on television, winning the ninth season (Fall 2009) of ABC's Dancing with the Stars, and still tours in the US and England. From September 2008 to November 2019, Donny & Marie performed a 90-minute show at the Flamingo Las Vegas. The show began in September 2008 and was originally scheduled to run for six months. The response was so overwhelming that the Flamingo immediately asked for a two-year extension. The Donny & Marie Show ultimately ran for 11 years, ending its run in 2019. Donny & Marie have been awarded ‚ÄúThe Best Show in Las Vegas‚Äù for 2012, 2013, and 2014, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. The showroom was renamed \\"The Donny and Marie Showroom\\" in 2013. The Osmonds performing in May 2008 Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay returned to using the name \\"the Osmond Brothers\\" and, building on the boom in country pop crossover artists and drawing from the success of the covers of \\"Rest Your Love on Me\\" from the previous album, started focusing on recording country music full-time. They had two top-30 Billboard Country hits in the early 1980s: \\"I Think About Your Lovin'\\" (#17) and \\"It's Like Fallin' in Love (Over and Over)\\" (#28), in addition to a handful that reached the bottom of or narrowly missed the top 40. The Osmond Brothers' record sales were hampered by a reluctance to go on tour; the group instead opted to stay in Branson, Missouri and promote their music through promotional music videos. The brothers continue to perform with various line-ups and sometimes with their children in Branson. Merrill performs and records as a solo artist as well; his biggest hit independent of his siblings was a duet with Jessica Boucher, \\"You're Here to Remember, I'm Here to Forget\\", a piece Merrill specifically chose to break from his family-friendly image (like Donny, Merrill had to hide his Osmond identity and recorded the song under the name \\"Merrill and Jessica\\") and which became a hit on the country charts in 1987. Alan has multiple sclerosis, and does not perform as often today; likewise, Wayne, who survived a brain tumor in 1997, retired from the group in the early 2010s. All of the brothers are married, some with large families. Alan's eight sons started performing in the mid-1980s as \\"the Osmond Boys\\", now known as \\"the Osmonds‚ÄîSecond Generation\\". David Osmond, the fourth of those eight sons, has since emerged as a solo artist;For Some, American Idol is a Second Chance at Fame Yahoo News, February 4, 2009 he also performs as the lead of the Osmond Chapman Orchestra and frequently appears with his aunt and uncles in Osmonds performances. In 2007‚Äì2008 all of the Osmonds went on a tour of Europe to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of their career in show business. A special televised concert in Las Vegas (the only tour stop in the US), commemorating the anniversary, aired on US PBS stations on March 10, 2008. Alan played piano with the orchestra for most of the show and Virl and Tom provided signed lyrics for two songs. The Osmonds' long-time friend and mentor Andy Williams made a surprise appearance, reminiscing about how his father had told him to put the brothers on his variety show. In 2009, Donny and Marie Osmond recorded a television special for the British channel ITV1: An Audience with Donny and Marie, part of ITV's long-running An Audience with... series was based on their Las Vegas stage show. From 2008 to 2019, Donny and Marie performed a residency in Las Vegas at the Flamingo. Both tour extensively around the world, with Alan's son David Osmond occasionally filling in for Donny. Merrill, Jay and Jimmy also sing together at the Suncoast Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, along with some limited touring, mostly in the UK. Since Andy Williams's death, Merrill, Jay and Jimmy took over operations of his long- running Christmas show, which they perform in Branson, Missouri in November. In 2012, the trio released their first studio album in 28 years, I Can't Get There Without You, which featured the recording debut of Jimmy as lead singer. Alan and Wayne rejoined the group for one time only for what was billed as their last ever performance as the Osmond Brothers at Neal S. Blaisdell Center in Honolulu in October 2018, a concert that also included Marie and David among the performers. Since that time, Merrill and Jay have toured as \\"the Osmonds\\", sometimes appearing with Marie and David; in these shows (billed as \\"Marie and the Osmonds\\"), Jay and Merrill sing many of their old hits, and substitute for the late Paul Davis and Dan Seals on Marie's country duets. Jimmy toured separately with various projects at the time before suffering a stroke in December 2018; he stated in April 2019 that he was in good health and had decided to take a \\"long-overdue break\\" from performing. Alan and Wayne made a second \\"last ever performance\\" in October 2019, appearing on The Talk for Marie's birthday. The Osmonds, along with Barbra Streisand, rank among the poorest performers in terms of having their hits of the 1970s survive in recurrent rotation; classic hits and oldies stations rarely play any of their music, with the occasional exception of \\"One Bad Apple.\\" According to Sean Ross at RadioInsight, discussing the fifteen popular songs of 1971 that saw the biggest declines in airplay: > Teen acts had been with us from the beginning, of course, but not since the > early ‚Äò60s had they seemed so particularly stigmatized (...)

Parents Olive Osmond, mother of the Osmond siblings, died on May 9, 2004, at age 79. Their father, George Osmond, died on November 6, 2007, at age 90. The couple was survived by their nine children and 55 grandchildren as well as a number of great-grandchildren. Before George Osmond's death, plans were being made for him and the 120-plus members of the Osmond family to appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show to celebrate the family's 50th anniversary in show business. He died just a few days prior to the taping. The family ultimately decided to go on with the show as scheduled, and on Thursday, November 9, the entire Osmond family appeared on stage with Oprah Winfrey as a tribute to their father. The show aired the following day, the same day as George Osmond's funeral. Hollywood Walk of Fame In 2003, the Osmond Family was honored for their achievements in the entertainment industry with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

They were noted for their political agitation, provocative lyrics, and unusually shrill vocals by band leader Doc Corbin Dart. Dead Kennedys vocalist Jello Biafra signed them to his independent Alternative Tentacles label. Other members of the original line up included Dart's cousin Joe on guitar, Scott Fagersten on bass, and drummer Steve Shelley, who went on to play with Sonic Youth. History The band's debut LP The Crucifucks was recorded in 1984 and released in 1985 on Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles label. Wisconsin followed in 1987, also on Alternative Tentacles. Between that album and 1996's L.D. Eye, Dart recorded two solo projects, Patricia, on Alternative Tentacles in 1990, and Black Tuesday, a self-released cassette, in 1991. After a long hiatus, Doc released an album entitled \\"The Messiah\\" on Crustacean Records in 2004. The moniker he used for this album is \\"26\\". A Crucifucks compilation album entitled Our Will Be Done was issued in 1992, combining the band's first two LPs with a non-LP song, \\"Annual Report,\\" also featured on Maximum Rock 'n' Roll's compilation Welcome To 1984. A picture of a Philadelphia police officer posing as shot‚Äîoriginally part of a public relations campaign to obtain wage concessions from the city ‚Äîwas used on the album's back cover. Four years later, its discovery by the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police led to a lawsuit against the Crucifucks, which was eventually dismissed. Dart claims the Crucifucks never officially broke up, but rather drifted apart due to a variety of reasons. By the mid 1990s, Dart had formed a new group called The L.D. Eye. When the group had prepared a full-length record, Alternative Tentacles agreed to release it under the stipulation that it be credited to The Crucifucks. Thus, the group changed its name to The Crucifucks, although no former members other than Dart were involved with The L.D. Eye) and used The L.D. Eye as the title of the 1996 album. The band played a number of concerts during this period, including a 1998 performance at Alternative Tentacles' twentieth anniversary party at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, California, before sinking back into inactivity. The band was known for its anti-authoritarian lyrics, often rife with obscure and perverse humor. The band sought to go beyond the pale in terms of lyrical content, attempting to be as offensive as possible. Many of their other songs are similarly blunt, attacking the American government, American culture in general, and religion, particularly Christianity. As recently as 2006, Dart has begun identifying himself by the name 26 (dropping his entire given name of Doc Corbin Dart) and renounces swear words, such as his former group's moniker.

Someone who studies petrography is called a petrographer. The mineral content and the textural relationships within the rock are described in detail. The classification of rocks is based on the information acquired during the petrographic analysis. Petrographic descriptions start with the field notes at the outcrop and include macroscopic description of hand specimens. However, the most important tool for the petrographer is the petrographic microscope. The detailed analysis of minerals by optical mineralogy in thin section and the micro-texture and structure are critical to understanding the origin of the rock. Electron microprobe or atom probe tomography analysis of individual grains as well as whole rock chemical analysis by atomic absorption, X-ray fluorescence, and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy are used in a modern petrographic lab. Individual mineral grains from a rock sample may also be analyzed by X-ray diffraction when optical means are insufficient. Analysis of microscopic fluid inclusions within mineral grains with a heating stage on a petrographic microscope provides clues to the temperature and pressure conditions existent during the mineral formation. History Petrography as a science began in 1828 when Scottish physicist William Nicol invented the technique for producing polarized light by cutting a crystal of Iceland spar, a variety of calcite, into a special prism which became known as the Nicol prism. The addition of two such prisms to the ordinary microscope converted the instrument into a polarizing, or petrographic microscope. Using transmitted light and Nicol prisms, it was possible to determine the internal crystallographic character of very tiny mineral grains, greatly advancing the knowledge of a rock's constituents. During the 1840s, a development by Henry C. Sorby and others firmly laid the foundation of petrography. This was a technique to study very thin slices of rock. A slice of rock was affixed to a microscope slide and then ground so thin that light could be transmitted through mineral grains that otherwise appeared opaque. The position of adjoining grains was not disturbed, thus permitting analysis of rock texture. Thin section petrography became the standard method of rock study. Since textural details contribute greatly to knowledge of the sequence of crystallization of the various mineral constituents in a rock, petrography progressed into petrogenesis and ultimately into petrology. It was in Europe, principally in Germany, that petrography advanced in the last half of the nineteenth century. Methods of investigation =Macroscopic characters= The macroscopic characters of rocks, those visible in hand-specimens without the aid of the microscope, are very varied and difficult to describe accurately and fully. The geologist in the field depends principally on them and on a few rough chemical and physical tests; and to the practical engineer, architect and quarry-master they are all-important. Although frequently insufficient in themselves to determine the true nature of a rock, they usually serve for a preliminary classification, and often give all the information needed. With a small bottle of acid to test for carbonate of lime, a knife to ascertain the hardness of rocks and minerals, and a pocket lens to magnify their structure, the field geologist is rarely at a loss to what group a rock belongs. The fine grained species are often indeterminable in this way, and the minute mineral components of all rocks can usually be ascertained only by microscopic examination. But it is easy to see that a sandstone or grit consists of more or less rounded, water- worn sand grains and if it contains dull, weathered particles of feldspar, shining scales of mica or small crystals of calcite these also rarely escape observation. Shales and clay rocks generally are soft, fine grained, often laminated and not infrequently contain minute organisms or fragments of plants. Limestones are easily marked with a knife-blade, effervesce readily with weak cold acid and often contain entire or broken shells or other fossils. The crystalline nature of a granite or basalt is obvious at a glance, and while the former contains white or pink feldspar, clear vitreous quartz and glancing flakes of mica, the other shows yellow-green olivine, black augite, and gray stratiated plagioclase. Other simple tools include the blowpipe (to test the fusibility of detached crystals), the goniometer, the magnet, the magnifying glass and the specific gravity balance. =Microscopic characteristics= Photomicrograph of a volcanic sand grain; upper picture is plane-polarized light, bottom picture is cross-polarized light, scale box at left-center is 0.25 millimeter. When dealing with unfamiliar types or with rocks so fine grained that their component minerals cannot be determined with the aid of a hand lens, a microscope is used. Characteristics observed under the microscope include colour, colour variation under plane polarised light (pleochroism, produced by the lower Nicol prism, or more recently polarising films), fracture characteristics of the grains, refractive index (in comparison to the mounting adhesive, typically Canada balsam), and optical symmetry (birefringent or isotropic). In toto, these characteristics are sufficient to identify the mineral, and often to quite tightly estimate its major element composition. The process of identifying minerals under the microscope is fairly subtle, but also mechanistic - it would be possible to develop an identification key that would allow a computer to do it. The more difficult and skilful part of optical petrography is identifying the interrelationships between grains and relating them to features seen in hand specimen, at outcrop, or in mapping. =Separation of components= Separation of the ingredients of a crushed rock powder to obtain pure samples for analysis is a common approach. It may be performed with a powerful, adjustable-strength electromagnet. A weak magnetic field attracts magnetite, then haematite and other iron ores. Silicates that contain iron follow in definite order‚Äîbiotite, enstatite, augite, hornblende, garnet, and similar ferro-magnesian minerals are successively abstracted. Finally, only the colorless, non-magnetic compounds, such as muscovite, calcite, quartz, and feldspar remain. Chemical methods also are useful. A weak acid dissolves calcite from crushed limestone, leaving only dolomite, silicates, or quartz. Hydrofluoric acid attacks feldspar before quartz and, if used cautiously, dissolves these and any glassy material in a rock powder before it dissolves augite or hypersthene. Methods of separation by specific gravity have a still wider application. The simplest of these is levigation, which is extensively employed in mechanical analysis of soils and treatment of ores, but is not so successful with rocks, as their components do not, as a rule, differ greatly in specific gravity. Fluids are used that do not attack most rock-forming minerals, but have a high specific gravity. Solutions of potassium mercuric iodide (sp. gr. 3.196), cadmium borotungstate (sp. gr. 3.30), methylene iodide (sp. gr. 3.32), bromoform (sp. gr. 2.86), or acetylene bromide (sp. gr. 3.00) are the principal fluids employed. They may be diluted (with water, benzene, etc.) or concentrated by evaporation. If the rock is granite consisting of biotite (sp. gr. 3.1), muscovite (sp. gr. 2.85), quartz (sp. gr. 2.65), oligoclase (sp. gr. 2.64), and orthoclase (sp. gr. 2.56), the crushed minerals float in methylene iodide. On gradual dilution with benzene they precipitate in the order above. Simple in theory, these methods are tedious in practice, especially as it is common for one rock-making mineral to enclose another. However, expert handling of fresh and suitable rocks yields excellent results. =Chemical analysis= In addition to naked-eye and microscopic investigation, chemical research methods are of great practical importance to the petrographer. Crushed and separated powders, obtained by the processes above, may be analyzed to determine chemical composition of minerals in the rock qualitatively or quantitatively. Chemical testing, and microscopic examination of minute grains is an elegant and valuable means of discriminating between mineral components of fine-grained rocks. Thus, the presence of apatite in rock-sections is established by covering a bare rock- section with ammonium molybdate solution. A turbid yellow precipitate forms over the crystals of the mineral in question (indicating the presence of phosphates). Many silicates are insoluble in acids and cannot be tested in this way, but others are partly dissolved, leaving a film of gelatinous silica that can be stained with coloring matters, such as the aniline dyes (nepheline, analcite, zeolites, etc.). Complete chemical analysis of rocks are also widely used and important, especially in describing new species. Rock analysis has of late years (largely under the influence of the chemical laboratory of the United States Geological Survey) reached a high pitch of refinement and complexity. As many as twenty or twenty-five components may be determined, but for practical purposes a knowledge of the relative proportions of silica, alumina, ferrous and ferric oxides, magnesia, lime, potash, soda and water carry us a long way in determining a rock's position in the conventional classifications. A chemical analysis is usually sufficient to indicate whether a rock is igneous or sedimentary, and in either case to accurately show what subdivision of these classes it belongs to. In the case of metamorphic rocks it often establishes whether the original mass was a sediment or of volcanic origin. =Specific gravity= Specific gravity of rocks is determined by use of a balance and pycnometer. It is greatest in rocks containing the most magnesia, iron, and heavy metal while least in rocks rich in alkalis, silica, and water. It diminishes with weathering. Generally, the specific gravity of rocks with the same chemical composition is higher if highly crystalline and lower if wholly or partly vitreous. The specific gravity of the more common rocks range from about 2.5 to 3.2. Archaeological applications Archaeologists use petrography to identify mineral components in pottery. This information ties the artifacts to geological areas where the raw materials for the pottery were obtained. In addition to clay, potters often used rock fragments, usually called \\"temper\\" or \\"aplastics\\", to modify the clay's properties. The geological information obtained from the pottery components provides insight into how potters selected and used local and non- local resources. Archaeologists are able to determine whether pottery found in a particular location was locally produced or traded from elsewhere. This kind of information, along with other evidence, can support conclusions about settlement patterns, group and individual mobility, social contacts, and trade networks. In addition, an understanding of how certain minerals are altered at specific temperatures can allow archaeological petrographers to infer aspects of the ceramic production process itself, such as minimum and maximum temperatures reached during the original firing of the pot.

It is on the north bank of the River Tees and for ceremonial purposes is in County Durham. The bridge at Eaglescliffe on the border with Yarm marked the last crossing point of tidal section of the River Tees until a five-arch stone toll bridge was built in 1771 in Stockton on Tees. This bridge was replaced in 1887 by the Victoria Bridge, now a grade ll listed building. The opening of the Tees Barrage in Stockton in 1995 made the section of the Tees through Eaglescliffe non-tidal. Eaglescliffe is divided by railway lines which lead from Yarm to Stockton and can only be crossed by vehicles at the north and south of the town, although there are two pedestrian bridges and an underpass. History The name of the town is thought to be derived from a misspelling of the name of the nearby village of Egglescliffe meaning a church on a hill. A common myth on the name change is that in Victorian times the sign for the new railway station turned up incorrect after the signwriter thought that Egglescliffe was a mistake and altered it. Bishop Skirlaw of Durham built a stone bridge across the Tees in 1400 which still stands. An iron replacement was built in 1805, but it fell down in 1806. The Stockton and Darlington Railway passed through the grounds of Preston Hall in Eaglescliffe, and on the opening day there was a famous race between a stagecoach travelling down Yarm Road, and the Locomotion No. 1. In 2011, Eaglescliffe was named the 4th best place for families to live in England and Wales, according to the savings firm Family Investments. =Allens West= From the 1940s to the 1990s there was an MOD base situated at Allens West in Eaglescliffe. After World War II the base was Metal Reclamation Unit No 2, and was used to dismantle aircraft that were downed in the north of England. It then became the Royal Navy Spare Parts Distribution Centre (RNSPDC), and later the Royal Navy Supply Depot (RNSD) Eaglescliffe, until its closure in January 1997 as part of the 'Defence Cost Study'. The storage and distribution functions were transferred to Portsmouth Naval Base, and the procurement function to MOD's site at Abbey Wood, Bristol. At its height, the Depot employed more than 2,000 staff and had a significant influence on the local economy. This later reduced to around 750 just prior to closure in 1997. Part of the former MOD site is now the Urlay Nook Admiralty ecology park, the rest of the site was sold to a Distribution company in 1997. Aerial photographs show that the site used to have railway sidings and a small runway. A masterplan has been drawn up to build up to 1000 homes, a 5000m care home, 500m of community facilities, and up to 1000m of retail space on the site.http://www.planningwam.stockton.gov.uk/WAM133/doc/Drawing-1523310.pdf?extension=.pdf&id;=1523310&location;=VOLUME1&contentType;=application/pdf&pageCount;=1  Geography  A map of Eaglescliffe showing main roads and estates. Eaglescliffe adjoins a small village called Egglescliffe, and legend says that the name Eaglescliffe came about when a mistake was made on the railway station's sign. The village lies in the civil parish of Egglescliffe, as does Urlay Nook, to the west. The north part of Eaglescliffe, to the west of the A135, lies within the parish of Preston-on-Tees. Several housing estates combine to form Eaglescliffe including Millfield, Kingsmead, Sunningdale, Hunters Green and Orchard Estate. The main road through the town is the A135 Yarm Road which was part of the old route of the A19 until the 1970s when it was diverted near Thornaby-on-Tees to the east. Nearby towns include Stockton- On-Tees and Middlesbrough to the north and north-east and Darlington to the west.  Events  Many events are held in Eaglescliffe every year, mostly in Preston Park which is situated to the north of the town on the Tees. Many of these events are run by Stockton Council. One of the events at Preston Park Preston Hall museum in Eaglescliffe. Many local groups gather at the community centres and village halls within Eaglescliffe and its neighbouring village, Egglescliffe. Egglescliffe Community Centre is the largest, and plays host to two amateur dramatics groups ‚Äì Cliffe Theatre (who produce at least two plays every year), and Centre Stage (who produce a pantomime every January, as well as a musical every summer). Egglescliffe Community Centre also hosts many other community groups including a Ladies Section, a weight loss group, dance classes, and many others.  Sport and leisure  Within Eaglescliffe, sited on Yarm Road, is Eaglescliffe Golf Club ‚Äì a course which occupies the land on the eastern side of Eaglescliffe bordered to the south by the Sunningdale Estate, to the north by Teesside High School, and to the east by the River Tees. Many street names in the Sunningdale Estate, as well as the name of the local 'Links Primary School', reflect the location of this golf club. Preston Park is where families go for both sport and leisure. Fields near the Golf course, by the River Tees Education Eaglescliffe has one secondary school called Egglescliffe School. This is in the east of the town and also has Egglescliffe Sixth Form College for ages 16‚Äì18. There are also four primary schools: Junction Farm, Durham Lane, The Links, and Preston. Egglescliffe village has a primary school called Egglescliffe CofE Primary School. As well as these there is also Teesside High School, an independent preparatory and high school, originally an all-girls school, it is now introducing boys within the framework of a diamond model of education. Economy Tetley Tea have had their only tea bag factory in the western world here since 1969 on Sowerby Way. It is the largest tea bag factory in the world, on the Durham Lane Industrial Park, having a floor area of and makes 18 billion tea bags a year; David Cameron and Boris Johnson have both visited the site Warburtons have a bakery outside of the village to the north-east on the Preston Farm Industrial Estate. The Elementis Chromium site in nearby Urlay Nook closed in June 2009. Governance A popular walk is between Eaglescliffe Golf Course and Yarm Eaglescliffe is part of the Stockton South Parliamentary Constituency which is currently represented in the House of Commons by Matt Vickers (Conservative) who won the 2019 general election by a majority of 5,260. The previous MP was Dr Paul Williams (Labour), \\"a local GP\\" (2017-2019).https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/17953631.blue-plaque- finally-unveiled-spennymoors-aviation-pioneer/ A previous MP is James Wharton (2010-2017) the former Conservative Minister for Northern Powerhouse.

He scored a last-minute goal for Real Zaragoza in the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final against Arsenal, with a 40-yard lob in the final minute of extra time. During eight seasons in La Liga, he played 130 matches and scored five goals. Having started his professional career with Barcelona, Nayim also represented Tottenham for five years. Club career =Barcelona / Tottenham= At the age of 12, Nayim left his hometown of Ceuta and joined FC Barcelona's youth academy La Masia, as the first team was managed by Terry Venables, but had very few opportunities over the course of two seasons. He arrived at Tottenham Hotspur in November 1988 originally on loan, signing the following year for ¬£400,000; his first goal for the club came in a 2‚Äì0 win at Southampton, and he also found the net in Spurs' 3‚Äì0 home success over West Ham United. Nayim made a total of 23 appearances in 1989‚Äì90, helping Tottenham to a third-place finish. The League Cup offered him his first experience of English cup competition, playing in four games en route to the quarter-finals and scoring three times. The following season proved to be Nayim's most successful in English football. Although the team finished in only 11th, he appeared in 33 league matches and netted five times; his path to a Wembley final was again halted at the League Cup semi-final but, in the FA Cup, they overcame Nottingham Forest 2‚Äì1 in the final, with the player replacing injured Paul Gascoigne early in the game and setting up both goals to bring success to White Hart Lane. Nayim appeared in 31 league contests in 1991‚Äì92, adding six appearances in the League Cup campaign, including both legs of the semi-final loss to Nottingham Forest. The following season, he won the Goal of the Month competition for October with a volley against Liverpool; he added a hat-trick in the FA Cup quarter-final at Manchester City, helping his team to a 4‚Äì2 win. =Zaragoza= In May 1993, Nayim signed for Real Zaragoza for ¬£500,000. His most notable moment in football came in the final seconds of extra-time in the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final by lobbing David Seaman from 45 yards to score a last-minute goal and win it 2‚Äì1 against Arsenal; nearly two decades later, he told UEFA's website that the strike was premeditated as his experience in England had taught him that the Gunners played a high defensive line. =Later years= Nayim retired in 2000, after a stint with Spanish Segunda Divisi√≥n side CD Logro√±√©s. He took up coaching afterwards, managing Atl√©tico Ceuta and serving as assistant to AD Ceuta; in late 2009, he joined former Zaragoza teammate Jos√© Aurelio Gay's coaching staff, being named his assistant manager after Marcelino Garc√≠a Toral's sacking. Nayim returned to his hometown in May 2016, to become sporting director at AD Ceuta FC. Personal life Nayim, a Muslim, was the only player of the Islamic faith to compete in the inaugural Premier League season. The eldest of his three children, Youssef, pursued a football career in the same position. In 2006, the Aragonese village of Trasmoz named a street 'Gol de Nayim' ('Nayim's Goal').

They are best known as the precursor for what would eventually become Guns N' Roses. The group was founded by Axl Rose, Izzy Stradlin and Chris Weber, while they were aided during live shows by Mick Mars, Johnny Kreis, Steve Darrow and Andre Troxx. Rose, Stradlin and Weber, along with Kreis, recorded a five-song demo in 1984. However, after a number of lineup changes, which includes Weber and Kreis being replaced by Slash and Steven Adler (both then of Road Crew) as well the departure of Stradlin, the group disbanded the same year. Hollywood Rose reunited for a New Year's Eve show in 1985 with Rose, Stradlin, and Darrow returning and adding former L.A. Guns drummer Rob Gardner to the group. L.A. Guns founder Tracii Guns replaced Weber for the reunion gig. In March 1985, they merged with L.A Guns to become Guns N' Roses. The five-song demo, recorded in 1984, was released in 2004 with the title The Roots of Guns N' Roses. A number of Hollywood Rose songs were included on the Guns N' Roses albums Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide (1986), Appetite for Destruction (1987), Live from the Jungle (1987), and G N' R Lies (1988). History =Formation (1983)= Prior to forming, guitarist Chris Weber was introduced to Lafayette native Izzy Stradlin, in the parking lot of the Rainbow Bar and Grill, by friend Tracii Guns, who was leading the first incarnation of L.A. Guns at this time, after Weber expressed an interest in forming a band. Soon afterwards, Weber and Stradlin started writing material and, at the suggestion of Stradlin, recruited his childhood friend, former Rapidfire and L.A. Guns singer Axl Rose, then known as Bill Rose. At the suggestion of Rose, the group called themselves AXL, with Rose adopting Axl as his first name. They played their first gig at The Orphanage in North Hollywood and played a few more shows before changing their name to Rose. The group soon changed their name, for the final time, to Hollywood Rose when Weber discovered that the name Rose was already being used by a New York band. During the group's live shows, they were aided by bassists Rick Mars, Andre Troxx and Steve Darrow, along with drummer Johnny Kreis, who remained the only consistent member of the group outside of Rose, Stradlin and Weber. =Lineup changes, Guns N' Roses (1984-1985)= After borrowing money from Weber's father, the group recorded a five-song demo in Hollywood in 1984. After playing a number of shows, they appeared at the Music Machine in 1984. During the show, Weber accidentally hit Rose with the headstock of his guitar. Rose stormed off and eventually fired Weber from the band, with former Road Crew guitarist Slash joining the group. Unhappy at the firing of Weber, Stradlin left the group when Slash first came to rehearse, going on to join London. Slash's Road Crew bandmate Steven Adler also replaced drummer Kreis during this time. The group continued to play more shows before eventually disbanding, playing their final show at The Troubadour in 1984. Rose went on to front L.A. Guns, while Slash auditioned for Poison at the suggestion of former guitarist Matt Smith. The group reunited for a New Years celebration show in 1985, with Rose, Stradlin and Darrow returning along while L.A. Guns drummer Rob Gardner also joined the group. Weber, who left to move to New York City, was replaced by Tracii Guns for the gig. Hollywood Rose then merged with L.A. Guns in March 1985, forming Guns N' Roses. The initial lineup consisted of Axl Rose, Tracii Guns, Izzy Stradlin, Ole Beich and Rob Gardner. Beich, Guns and Gardner were all gone from the band within two months and replaced by Duff McKagan, Slash, and Steven Adler. The lineup of Rose, Stradlin, McKagan, Slash and Adler became known as the \\"classic lineup\\" of Guns N' Roses. A number of Hollywood Rose songs would be included on releases by Guns N' Roses, including \\"Anything Goes\\" (from Appetite for Destruction), \\"Reckless Life\\" and \\"Move to the City\\" (both from Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide and G N' R Lies) as well as \\"Shadow of Your Love\\" (from Live from the Jungle). In 1998, former guitarist Weber sued Axl Rose, claiming that he co-wrote two songs he was not credited for, \\"Shadow of Your Love\\" and \\"Back Off Bitch\\" (from Use Your Illusion I). =Reformation (1989-1990)= In 1989, Weber reformed Hollywood Rose with new vocalist Jimmy Swan and they were signed to Summa Music Group. A full-length album was recorded but went unreleased. One track from the album, \\"Sweet Little Angel\\", was subsequently released on the soundtrack to the 1990 film Miami Blues. A second studio track, \\"Come A Little Closer\\" with Jimmy Swan on vocals can be heard on the four disc box set Rock 'n' Roll Rebels & the Sunset Strip, Vol. 1. =The Roots of Guns N' Roses (2004)= In 2004, Weber, who had formed U.P.O. since leaving the band, sold the five-song demo the group recorded in 1984 to Cleopatra Records. They released the album, which included, along with the original recordings, remixes by former Guns N' Roses guitarist Gilby Clarke (which featured addition guitar overdubs by Tracii Guns) and former London and Cinderella drummer Fred Coury (who had filled in for Guns N' Roses drummer Steven Adler for a few shows) on June 22 with the title The Roots of Guns N' Roses. The Japanese edition of the album included a DVD with footage of the group. On June 21, 2004, Axl Rose had sought an injunction against the release of the album, suing Cleopatra Records for trademark infringement, violation of rights in his name and likeness, and for unfair competition.

The film is based on the 1968 film Sweet November written by Herman Raucher, which starred Anthony Newley and Sandy Dennis. Sweet November was released on February 16, 2001. It received negative reviews from critics and grossed $65 million worldwide. Plot Nelson Moss meets Sara Deever, a woman very different from anyone he has met before. His ignorance leads to her failing her driving test. She beguiles him and continually asks him to spend a month with her on the promise that she will change his life for the better. On the first night of November, after Nelson is fired and dumped on the same day, she sleeps with him, and the next day Chaz, a close friend of Sara's, arrives and refers to Nelson as Sara's \\"November\\". Throughout November, the two experience happy times together and fall in love. Nelson examines his life and past, and befriends a fatherless child named Abner. Eventually, he realizes he is in love with Sara and asks her to marry him. It is revealed that Sara has terminal cancer, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Because she cannot bear to have Nelson experience her death, she asks him to leave. Sara tells Chaz that Nelson proposed to her. Chaz says that it wasn't the first time that a man had proposed, implying Sara has had numerous \\"months\\" before. Sara confirms this but claims it was the first time she had wanted to say yes. She decides she will not continue the relationship to protect Nelson from being hurt. Nelson complies, but then stages a surprise return during the Thanksgiving holiday, giving her gifts that remind her of their happy times. They stay together for one more day; he posts November calendars all over her apartment walls, saying it can always be November for them. They make love, but the next morning, Nelson finds Sara is dressed. She asks him to leave, and he sees she has taken down the calendars. Nelson becomes confused and heartbroken. Sara asks Nelson to let her go so that he will always have happy memories of her and explains that this is how she needs to be remembered. She will return home to her family (whom she had been avoiding) and face her last days. Sara then blindfolds Nelson, leads him to a park, and gives him a last kiss. Nelson takes off the blindfold and sees that he is alone in a park he and Sara went on one of their first dates. His eyes fill with tears and the movie ends. Cast Music Reception =Box office= The film opened at number 4 at the North American box office making $11,015,226 in its opening weekend behind Recess: School's Out, Down to Earth and Hannibal. It ultimately grossed only $25.2 million domestically with an additional $40.4 million overseas to a total of $65.7 million worldwide. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 15% based on 98 reviews, with an average rating of 3.52/10. The website's critics consensus states: \\"Schmaltzy and manipulative, Sweet November suffers from an implausible plot and non-existent chemistry between its leads.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 27 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Todd McCarthy of Variety called it: \\"A contrived but entirely workable premise is given a well-tooled treatment in Sweet November, a femme-slanted doomed romance with a heavily calculated feel to it.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it 1 out of 4, and wrote: \\"Passes off pathological behavior as romantic bliss. It's about two sick and twisted people playing mind games and calling it love.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone warned: \\"Beware all male viewers who enter here, you are in chick-movie hell.\\" The film was nominated for three Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Remake or Sequel (where it lost to Planet of the Apes), Worst Actor for Keanu Reeves (lost to Tom Green for Freddy Got Fingered) and Worst Actress for Charlize Theron (lost to Mariah Carey for Glitter). It is listed on Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

Emission theories obey the principle of relativity by having no preferred frame for light transmission, but say that light is emitted at speed \\"c\\" relative to its source instead of applying the invariance postulate. Thus, emitter theory combines electrodynamics and mechanics with a simple Newtonian theory. Although there are still proponents of this theory outside the scientific mainstream, this theory is considered to be conclusively discredited by most scientists. History The name most often associated with emission theory is Isaac Newton. In his corpuscular theory Newton visualized light \\"corpuscles\\" being thrown off from hot bodies at a nominal speed of c with respect to the emitting object, and obeying the usual laws of Newtonian mechanics, and we then expect light to be moving towards us with a speed that is offset by the speed of the distant emitter (c ¬± v). In the 20th century, special relativity was created by Albert Einstein to solve the apparent conflict between electrodynamics and the principle of relativity. The theory's geometrical simplicity was persuasive, and the majority of scientists accepted relativity by 1911. However, a few scientists rejected the second basic postulate of relativity: the constancy of the speed of light in all inertial frames. So different types of emission theories were proposed where the speed of light depends on the velocity of the source, and the Galilean transformation is used instead of the Lorentz transformation. All of them can explain the negative outcome of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment, since the speed of light is constant with respect to the interferometer in all frames of reference. Some of those theories were: *Light retains throughout its whole path the component of velocity which it obtained from its original moving source, and after reflection light spreads out in spherical form around a center which moves with the same velocity as the original source. (Proposed by Walter Ritz in 1908).. See also the English translation . This model was considered to be the most complete emission theory. (Actually, Ritz was modeling Maxwell‚ÄìLorentz electrodynamics. In a later paper Ritz said that the emission particles in his theory should suffer interactions with charges along their path and thus waves (produced by them) would not retain their original emission velocities indefinitely.) *The excited portion of a reflecting mirror acts as a new source of light and the reflected light has the same velocity c with respect to the mirror as has original light with respect to its source. (Proposed by Richard Chase Tolman in 1910, although he was a supporter of special relativity). *Light reflected from a mirror acquires a component of velocity equal to the velocity of the mirror image of the original source (Proposed by Oscar M. Stewart in 1911). *A modification of the Ritz‚ÄìTolman theory was introduced by J. G. Fox (1965). He argued that the extinction theorem (i.e., the regeneration of light within the traversed medium) must be considered. In air, the extinction distance would be only 0.2 cm, that is, after traversing this distance the speed of light would be constant with respect to the medium, not to the initial light source. (Fox himself was, however, a supporter of special relativity.) Albert Einstein is supposed to have worked on his own emission theory before abandoning it in favor of his special theory of relativity. Many years later R.S. Shankland reports Einstein as saying that Ritz's theory had been \\"very bad\\" in places and that he himself had eventually discarded emission theory because he could think of no form of differential equations that described it, since it leads to the waves of light becoming \\"all mixed up\\". Refutations of emission theory The following scheme was introduced by de Sitter to test emission theories: :c'=c\\\\pm kv\\\\, where c is the speed of light, v that of the source, c' the resultant speed of light, and k a constant denoting the extent of source dependence which can attain values between 0 and 1. According to special relativity and the stationary aether, k=0, while emission theories allow values up to 1. Numerous terrestrial experiments have been performed, over very short distances, where no \\"light dragging\\" or extinction effects could come into play, and again the results confirm that light speed is independent of the speed of the source, conclusively ruling out emission theories. = Astronomical sources = In 1910 Daniel Frost Comstock and in 1913 Willem de Sitter wrote that for the case of a double-star system seen edge-on, light from the approaching star might be expected to travel faster than light from its receding companion, and overtake it. If the distance was great enough for an approaching star's \\"fast\\" signal to catch up with and overtake the \\"slow\\" light that it had emitted earlier when it was receding, then the image of the star system should appear completely scrambled. De Sitter argued that none of the star systems he had studied showed the extreme optical effect behavior, and this was considered the death knell for Ritzian theory and emission theory in general, with k < 2\\\\times10^{-3}. The effect of extinction on de Sitter's experiment has been considered in detail by Fox, and it arguably undermines the cogency of de Sitter type evidence based on binary stars. However, similar observations have been made more recently in the x-ray spectrum by Brecher (1977), which have a long enough extinction distance that it should not affect the results. The observations confirm that the speed of light is independent of the speed of the source, with k < 2\\\\times10^{-9}. Hans Thirring argued in 1926, that an atom which is accelerated during the emission process by thermal collisions in the sun, is emitting light rays having different velocities at their start- and endpoints. So one end of the light ray would overtake the preceding parts, and consequently the distance between the ends would be elongated up to 500 km until they reach Earth, so that the mere existence of sharp spectral lines in the sun's radiation, disproves the ballistic model. = Terrestrial sources = Such experiments include that of Sadeh (1963) who used a time-of-flight technique to measure velocity differences of photons traveling in opposite direction, which were produced by positron annihilation. Another experiment was conducted by Alv√§ger et al. (1963), who compared the time of flight of gamma rays from moving and resting sources. Both experiments found no difference, in accordance with relativity. Filippas and Fox (1964) did not consider Sadeh (1963) and Alv√§ger (1963) to have sufficiently controlled for the effects of extinction. So they conducted an experiment using a setup specifically designed to account for extinction. Data collected from various detector-target distances were consistent with there being no dependence of the speed of light on the velocity of the source, and were inconsistent with modeled behavior assuming c ¬± v both with and without extinction. Continuing their previous investigations, Alv√§ger et al. (1964) observed œÄ0-mesons which decay into photons at 99.9% light speed. The experiment showed that the photons didn't attain the velocity of their sources and still traveled at the speed of light, with k =(-3\\\\pm13)\\\\times10^{-5}. The investigation of the media which were crossed by the photons showed that the extinction shift was not sufficient to distort the result significantly. Also measurements of neutrino speed have been conducted. Mesons travelling nearly at light speed were used as sources. Since neutrinos only participate in the electroweak interaction, extinction plays no role. Terrestrial measurements provided upper limits of k\\\\leq10^{-6}. = Interferometry = The Sagnac effect demonstrates that one beam on a rotating platform covers less distance than the other beam, which creates the shift in the interference pattern. Georges Sagnac's original experiment has been shown to suffer extinction effects, but since then, the Sagnac effect has also been shown to occur in vacuum, where extinction plays no role. The predictions of Ritz's version of emission theory were consistent with almost all terrestrial interferometric tests save those involving the propagation of light in moving media, and Ritz did not consider the difficulties presented by tests such as the Fizeau experiment to be insurmountable. Tolman, however, noted that a Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment using an extraterrestrial light source could provide a decisive test of the Ritz hypothesis. In 1924, Rudolf Tomaschek performed a modified Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment using starlight, while Dayton Miller used sunlight. Both experiments were inconsistent with the Ritz hypothesis. Babcock and Bergman (1964) placed rotating glass plates between the mirrors of a common-path interferometer set up in a static Sagnac configuration. If the glass plates behave as new sources of light so that the total speed of light emerging from their surfaces is c + v, a shift in the interference pattern would be expected. However, there was no such effect which again confirms special relativity, and which again demonstrates the source independence of light speed. This experiment was executed in vacuum, thus extinction effects should play no role. Albert Abraham Michelson (1913) and Quirino Majorana (1918/9) conducted interferometer experiments with resting sources and moving mirrors (and vice versa), and showed that there is no source dependence of light speed in air. Michelson's arrangement was designed to distinguish between three possible interactions of moving mirrors with light: (1) \\"the light corpuscles are reflected as projectiles from an elastic wall\\", (2) \\"the mirror surface acts as a new source\\", (3) \\"the velocity of light is independent of the velocity of the source\\". His results were consistent with source independence of light speed. Majorana analyzed the light from moving sources and mirrors using an unequal arm Michelson interferometer that was extremely sensitive to wavelength changes. Emission theory asserts that Doppler shifting of light from a moving source represents a frequency shift with no shift in wavelength. Instead, Majorana detected wavelength changes inconsistent with emission theory. Beckmann and Mandics (1965) repeated the Michelson (1913) and Majorana (1918) moving mirror experiments in high vacuum, finding k to be less than 0.09. Although the vacuum employed was insufficient to definitively rule out extinction as the reason for their negative results, it was sufficient to make extinction highly unlikely. Light from the moving mirror passed through a Lloyd interferometer, part of the beam traveling a direct path to the photographic film, part reflecting off the Lloyd mirror. The experiment compared the speed of light hypothetically traveling at c + v from the moving mirrors, versus reflected light hypothetically traveling at c from the Lloyd mirror. = Other refutations = Emission theories use the Galilean transformation, according to which time coordinates are invariant when changing frames (\\"absolute time\\"). Thus the Ives‚ÄìStilwell experiment, which confirms relativistic time dilation, also refutes the emission theory of light. As shown by Howard Percy Robertson, the complete Lorentz transformation can be derived, when the Ives‚ÄìStillwell experiment is considered together with the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment and the Kennedy‚ÄìThorndike experiment. Furthermore, quantum electrodynamics places the propagation of light in an entirely different, but still relativistic, context, which is completely incompatible with any theory that postulates a speed of light that is affected by the speed of the source.

A. Todd and H. S. M. Coxeter in 1936, is an algorithm for solving the coset enumeration problem. Given a presentation of a group G by generators and relations and a subgroup H of G, the algorithm enumerates the cosets of H on G and describes the permutation representation of G on the space of the cosets (given by the left multiplication action). If the order of a group G is relatively small and the subgroup H is known to be uncomplicated (for example, a cyclic group), then the algorithm can be carried out by hand and gives a reasonable description of the group G. Using their algorithm, Coxeter and Todd showed that certain systems of relations between generators of known groups are complete, i.e. constitute systems of defining relations. The Todd‚ÄìCoxeter algorithm can be applied to infinite groups and is known to terminate in a finite number of steps, provided that the index of H in G is finite. On the other hand, for a general pair consisting of a group presentation and a subgroup, its running time is not bounded by any computable function of the index of the subgroup and the size of the input data.  Description of the algorithm  One implementation of the algorithm proceeds as follows. Suppose that G = \\\\langle X \\\\mid R \\\\rangle , where X is a set of generators and R is a set of relations and denote by X' the set of generators X and their inverses. Let H = \\\\langle h_1, h_2, \\\\ldots, h_s \\\\rangle where the h_i are words of elements of X' . There are three types of tables that will be used: a coset table, a relation table for each relation in R , and a subgroup table for each generator h_i of H . Information is gradually added to these tables, and once they are filled in, all cosets have been enumerated and the algorithm terminates. The coset table is used to store the relationships between the known cosets when multiplying by a generator. It has rows representing cosets of H and a column for each element of X' . Let C_i denote the coset of the ith row of the coset table, and let g_j \\\\in X' denote generator of the jth column. The entry of the coset table in row i, column j is defined to be (if known) k, where k is such that C_k = C_ig_j . The relation tables are used to detect when some of the cosets we have found are actually equivalent. One relation table for each relation in R is maintained. Let 1 = g_{n_1} g_{n_2} \\\\cdots g_{n_t} be a relation in R , where g_{n_i} \\\\in X' . The relation table has rows representing the cosets of H , as in the coset table. It has t columns, and the entry in the ith row and jth column is defined to be (if known) k, where C_k = C_i g_{n_1} g_{n_2} \\\\cdots g_{n_j} . In particular, the (i,t)'th entry is initially i, since g_{n_1} g_{n_2} \\\\cdots g_{n_t} = 1. Finally, the subgroup tables are similar to the relation tables, except that they keep track of possible relations of the generators of H . For each generator h_n = g_{n_1} g_{n_2} \\\\cdots g_{n_t} of H , with g_{n_i} \\\\in X' , we create a subgroup table. It has only one row, corresponding to the coset of H itself. It has t columns, and the entry in the jth column is defined (if known) to be k, where C_k = H g_{n_1} g_{n_2} \\\\cdots g_{n_j} . When a row of a relation or subgroup table is completed, a new piece of information C_i = C_j g , g \\\\in X' , is found. This is known as a deduction. From the deduction, we may be able to fill in additional entries of the relation and subgroup tables, resulting in possible additional deductions. We can fill in the entries of the coset table corresponding to the equations C_i = C_j g and C_j = C_i g^{-1} . However, when filling in the coset table, it is possible that we may already have an entry for the equation, but the entry has a different value. In this case, we have discovered that two of our cosets are actually the same, known as a coincidence. Suppose C_i = C_j , with i < j . We replace all instances of j in the tables with i. Then, we fill in all possible entries of the tables, possibly leading to more deductions and coincidences. If there are empty entries in the table after all deductions and coincidences have been taken care of, add a new coset to the tables and repeat the process. We make sure that when adding cosets, if Hx is a known coset, then Hxg will be added at some point for all g \\\\in X' . (This is needed to guarantee that the algorithm will terminate provided G : H is finite.) When all the tables are filled, the algorithm terminates. We then have all needed information on the action of G on the cosets of H .

They have released five full- length albums and five EPs. Failure reunited in 2014. History =1992‚Äì1997: Formation, Comfort, Magnified and Fantastic Planet= In 1992, Failure signed with Slash Records (an LA-based independent label whose releases were manufactured and distributed by Warner Bros. in the United States), and went to Minnesota to record their debut album with producer Steve Albini at Pachyderm Studio that summer. Comfort was released in September 1992, and around this same time, they went on their first of several tours with Tool. The band were unsatisfied with the sound of Comfort and their lack of involvement in the mixing process; they wanted a more flattering, produced sound that went beyond Albini's style of essentially documenting a band's raw live sound. So when the band went back into the studio in 1993, Andrews and Edwards took on the role of producers themselves. Midway through these sessions, Gauss left the band, so Edwards played some drums himself, until a replacement was found in Kellii Scott. Their second album, Magnified, was released in March 1994; a promotional video (the band's first) was made for the single \\"Undone\\", but it received little airtime, if any, on any of the traditional music video outlets. Critics took note of the sonic and musical advances achieved on Magnified, and other more well-known musicians also began singing Failure's praises. That year, they again went on tour with Tool, and during Failure's set each night, Tool guitarist Adam Jones came onstage to play rhythm guitar on the Comfort track \\"Macaque\\". Anxious to build on the momentum afforded to them by the relative success of Magnified, Andrews, Edwards, and Scott began recording again in 1995, this time in a rented home owned by Lita Ford in the hills just outside LA. With the band again producing themselves, and Andrews handling the lion's share of the engineering himself, the situation allowed the band to take far more time in recording than they ever had before, and follow their instincts as far as they chose without outside interference. As the recordings neared completion, they received word that their label's distribution deal with Warner had expired and would not be renewed. Since Failure was essentially sidelined while the owners of Slash were trying to negotiate a new distribution deal, the band members kept themselves busy with outside projects: Andrews and Edwards (and friends) recorded an album of covers under the name Replicants; Andrews produced albums for Blinker the Star and Molly McGuire (the Kansas City-based rock band, not the LA-based singer-songwriter); Scott did some session work. Meanwhile, the band continued to \\"unofficially\\" shop the record to other labels and industry personnel, while hoping that Warner would step up and release the album. In the spring of 1996, Warner did exactly that, agreeing to keep the Slash imprint one last time for Failure, and Fantastic Planet was released that August. Guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, a friend and former bandmate of Scott's, joined Failure around the time of the album's release. The album's first single, \\"Stuck on You\\" (an appropriately catchy mid-tempo track that metaphorically compares infatuation to a nagging tune stuck in one's head), became a minor alternative-radio hit and achieved light to medium rotation on MTV, but failed to chart significantly. The song peaked at No. 31 on the U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock chart and No. 23 on the Modern Rock chart.[ Billboard], Allmusic Other songs, such as \\"Saturday Saviour\\" and \\"Pitiful\\", received some airplay from more adventurous-minded DJs, but no more videos were made for any of the album's tracks, and due to the state of disarray at their label at that time, little effort was put into its promotion. In 1997, the band were asked by friends in the industrial rock band God Lives Underwater to contribute a track for a Depeche Mode tribute album that they were assembling; Failure chose to cover the 1990 hit \\"Enjoy the Silence\\", a worldwide smash and Depeche Mode's best-selling and most well-known single. The members of Depeche Mode were reportedly very pleased with the album, and with the Failure track particularly; Andrew Fletcher said that he actually prefers their cover over his band's original version. That summer, Failure also joined the Lollapalooza tour, during what became the last of that tour's travelling years. Originally booked to headline the side stage, Failure was promoted to also perform on the main stage to fill the void created when Korn dropped out; Failure played both an early afternoon set on the main stage and a longer headlining set in the evening on the side stage for the remainder of the tour. On November 19, 1997, Failure officially announced that they had disbanded, citing personal differences. =1997‚Äì2013: Post-breakup work= Ken Andrews has gone on to become a well-known producer, engineer, and mixer, and has been involved in several different music projects. ON (1999‚Äì2002) was more or less a solo project, and was not unlike Failure, in terms of songwriting, but the overall sound was more based on electronics, with less emphasis on guitars and the typical heavy rock sound. Year of the Rabbit (2002‚Äì2004) saw Andrews' return to the four-piece rock band format, alongside ON's touring drummer, Tim Dow, and former members of National Skyline and Cupcakes; the harder-rocking sound of YotR is much closer to that of Failure, but the band lost momentum and eventually went on indefinite hiatus after their label, Elektra Records, was ostensibly shut down by in the wake of its merger with Atlantic Records. Throughout all of this, Andrews has become increasingly sought-after for his production and mixing skills, and his r√©sum√© has expanded to include work on albums by Pete Yorn, Paramore, Candlebox, Tenacious D, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, and Mae, among many others. Also notable is his participation in the production of \\"You Know My Name\\", the theme for the 2006 James Bond movie Casino Royale, performed by then-former Soundgarden/Audioslave frontman Chris Cornell. Currently, Andrews is performing as a solo artist, as well as collaborating in a self-described \\"digital band\\" called Los Angeles Digital Noise Academy, whose loose membership also includes Brad Laner (Medicine), Sharky Laguana (Creeper Lagoon), Charlotte Martin (whom Andrews married in 2005), and others. He released his first solo album, Secrets of the Lost Satellite, in 2007. He has also started a label, Dinosaur Fight Records, which has released his solo album and Martin's, and has announced their intention to release the forthcoming LADNA album, as well. Greg Edwards collaborated with fellow musicians Chris Pitman, Brad Laner, and Paul D'Amour in the psychedelic pop outfit Lusk, releasing the album Free Mars in 1997. In 2000, Edwards formed the band Autolux in with vocalist/bassist Eugene Goreshter and former Ednaswap drummer Carla Azar. Their self-produced, self-released 2001 EP Demonstration brought them to the attention of legendary producer T Bone Burnett, who used his vanity label DMZ to secure them a contract with Sony BMG Music Entertainment and produced their debut album, Future Perfect, which was released in October 2004 to general critical praise. They were hand-picked by Trent Reznor to open for Nine Inch Nails' North American arena tour in the autumn of 2005, playing bottom of the bill before Queens of the Stone Age. In 2006, they collaborated on a few tracks with the British musical outfit Unkle, for Unkle's 2007 release, War Stories. After various delays, Autolux released their second album, Transit Transit, in 2010. Kellii Scott joined Blinker the Star after Failure's breakup, and then joined Campfire Girls for their 2003 album, Tell Them Hi. Scott also played on a track titled 'Best Friend' by Size 14 bassist Robt Ptak on his solo project Artificial Joy, Ptak put this on his own personal reverbnation page in 2013. As of 2005, he was playing drums for both Veruca Salt and Enemy. In 2008, his most recent band The Brontosaur released their self-titled album. From 2008-2012 Kellii could be heard playing on all Linda Perry's recording sessions, most notably Christina Aguilera's song \\"You Lift Me Up\\" and Courtney Love's \\"Letter To God\\". And in 2013 he worked with the Dr Dre and a 72 piece orchestra at Capitol studios for a song on his upcoming album. Troy Van Leeuwen first resurfaced in the original lineup of A Perfect Circle, appearing on their debut album, Mer De Noms (2000), and on the subsequent tour. During the sessions for APC's second album, Van Leeuwen was extended an invitation to join Queens of the Stone Age, which he accepted; he does appear on three tracks on the second APC album, Thirteenth Step (2003), but the included cover of Failure's \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" is not one of them. He has remained with Queens of the Stone Age since then, first appearing on the tour for their 2002 album, Songs for the Deaf, but not on the album itself. Also, during this time, Van Leeuwen assembled Enemy, a vehicle in which he is the front man and guitarist; their debut album, Hooray for Dark Matter, was released in October 2005. In 2008 Van Leeuwen formed the band Sweethead with vocalist Serrina Sims, who also provided backing vocals on Queens of the Stone Age single Make It wit Chu on the album Era Vulgaris, in 2007. The bands roster was rounded up with Norm Block formerly of Plexi and Troy's former Enemy bandmate Eddie Nappi. In 2004, although the band had been inactive for many years, Andrews and Edwards got together to collaborate on a CD/DVD set entitled Golden, which collects demos, outtakes, touring footage, both of the band's videos, and other rare material from the band's active period. Another posthumous compilation, a 2-CD set titled Essentials, was assembled for release in 2006; the first disc contains selected tracks from Failure's three studio albums, and the second disc features the first official CD release of all four songs from their two pre- Slash singles, and the complete demos for Magnified. In 2008, a tribute album to Failure was released titled: \\"A Tribute to Failure: The Nurse Who Loved Me.\\" On June 8, 2010, Fantastic Planet was planned to be released on a 2LP vinyl set for the first time from Warner Bros. Both Magnified and Comfort were released on LP for the first time in the second half of 2011 by ORG Music (Magnified was delayed until late 2013). The 2010 limited LP release of Fantastic Planet were in such high demand, that they were fetching hundreds of dollars online. In 2016 as part of their pledge project for The Heart Is A Monster, the band re-released Fantastic Planet on vinyl once more. =2013‚Äì2017: Reunion, The Heart is a Monster= Failure announced their reunion in late 2013. With the \\"classic lineup\\" of Greg Edwards, Ken Andrews and Kellii Scott, they performed their first show since 1997 at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles on February 13, 2014. It was subsequently announced that the band would open for Tool on their upcoming tour. After the first leg, starting in March and culminating with the \\"Cinquanta\\" shows on May 10 and 11 at The Greek Theater in Los Angeles, Failure's separate \\"Tree of Stars\\" tour took place during May and June 2014 for 18 performances. A tour exclusive EP entitled Tree of Stars was available during this leg. The EP contains 4 live tracks and their first new song since Fantastic Planet, entitled \\"Come Crashing\\". On May 14, Failure released the track on their Bandcamp following with \\"The Focus\\" on July 14, 2014. Failure commenced work on their fourth album in late 2014, which was significant as their first album in over eighteen years. On March 30, Failure announced their fourth studio album The Heart Is a Monster, spanning 18 tracks, which was released on June 30 through INgrooves. This announcement coincided with the release of the new single \\"Hot Traveler,\\" which the band debuted at SXSW earlier that month. Troy Van Leeuwen was not cited as returning to the band, however, he contributed guitar work on several tracks of the new album. Despite this, Failure announced that Van Leeuwen would participate in its October 2015 tour. In summer 2016 Failure announced an October tour where they would be playing Fantastic Planet in its entirety to celebrate the album's 20 year anniversary. On Thanksgiving 2016, Failure announced they'd be releasing Fantastic Planet live, using tracks recorded during the Fantastic Planet Anniversary tour. =2018‚Äìpresent: In the Future Your Body Will Be the Furthest Thing from Your Mind= On December 8, 2017, Failure's Slash Records albums were acquired by PIAS Recordings, as part of Warner Music Group's divestment of artist catalogues to indie labels. On March 14, 2018, Failure announced a series of four EPs, with the first, In The Future, released on March 30. The remaining three will be released throughout 2018 and will eventually culminate in a complete full-length studio album later in the year. The second EP, Your Body Will Be, was released on May 25, 2018, and the third, The Furthest Thing, was released on September 14, 2018. . The finished album, titled In The Future Your Body Will Be The Furthest Thing From Your Mind was released on November 16, 2018, with the completion of the fourth and final EP, From Your Mind. In support of the new album, Failure embarked on a 29 city tour starting March 11, 2019 and ending April 24, 2019. They were joined by Swervedriver as a supporting act on the tour. On December 16, 2019, Failure announced their vinyl box set Failure 1992‚Äì1996, which includes their albums Comfort, Magnified, and Fantastic Planet. The band will embark on 2020 residency shows in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City in support of its release. On July 3, 2020, the band released a re-recorded cover of \\"Enjoy the Silence\\", titled \\"Enjoy the Silence 2020\\". Failure had originally covered the song in 1998 for the tribute album For the Masses and re-recorded the song due to the album being hard to find, being out of print for several years and not available on streaming sites. Ken Andrews stated that Failure received the blessing of Depeche Mode for the updated cover. Controversies The Heart is a Monster, Fantastic Planet Live, and In The Future Your Body Will Be The Furthest Thing From Your Mind were all funded from PledgeMusic, a crowdfunding website. The campaigns for The Heart is a Monster and Fantastic Planet Live were both successfully completed with all the crowdfunding rewards issued to backers. On March 5, 2019, an email alerted users of PledgeMusic that Failure was not paid at the end of the campaign for In The Future.. and backers should seek remedies from their credit card companies if not too late. Failure instead sold the campaign merchandise directly from their own website and during the following tour while PledgeMusic declared bankruptcy in May 2019. In November 2019, Ken Andrews released a statement about the aftermath of the PledgeMusic bankruptcy stating that a major label's artists got refunded from the bankruptcy while independent and self-funded musicians were left out. Musical style Musically, the band has been described as alternative rock, art rock, space rock, post-grunge and alternative metal.

The term \\"digastric muscle\\" refers to this specific muscle. However, other muscles that have two separate muscle bellies include the ligament of Treitz, omohyoid, occipitofrontalis. It lies below the body of the mandible, and extends, in a curved form, from the mastoid notch to the symphysis menti. It belongs to the suprahyoid muscles group. A broad aponeurotic layer is given off from the tendon of the digastricus on either side, to be attached to the body and greater cornu of the hyoid bone; this is termed the suprahyoid aponeurosis. Structure The digastricus (digastric muscle) consists of two muscular bellies united by an intermediate rounded tendon. The two bellies of the digastric muscle have different embryological origins, and are supplied by different cranial nerves. Each person has a right and left digastric muscle. In most anatomical discussions, the singular is used to refer to a muscle, even when each person actually has two of that muscle‚Äîone on the right side, and another on the left. For example, we speak of the deltoid, even though there is one deltoid in each shoulder. Likewise, we speak of the digastric even though there is a right and left digastric muscle. =Posterior belly= The posterior belly, longer than the anterior belly, arises from the mastoid notch which is on the inferior surface of the skull, medial to the mastoid process of the temporal bone. The mastoid notch is a deep groove between the mastoid process and the styloid process. The mastoid notch is also referred to as the digastric groove or the digastric fossa. The posterior belly is supplied by the digastric branch of facial nerve. The digastric muscle stretches between the mastoid process of the cranium to the mandible at the chin, and part-way between, it becomes a tendon which passes through a tendinous pulley attached to the hyoid bone. It originates from the second pharyngeal arch. =Anterior belly= The anterior belly arises from a depression on the inner side of the lower border of the mandible called the digastric fossa of mandible, close to the symphysis, and passes downward and backward. The anterior body is supplied by the trigeminal via the mylohyoid nerve, a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve, itself a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. It originates from the first pharyngeal arch. =Intermediate tendon= The two bellies end in an intermediate tendon which perforates the stylohyoideus muscle, and is held in connection with the side of the body and the greater cornu of the hyoid bone by a fibrous loop, which is sometimes lined by a mucous sheath. =Variations= Variations are numerous. The posterior belly may arise partly or entirely from the styloid process, or be connected by a slip to the middle or inferior constrictor; the anterior belly may be double or extra slips from this belly may pass to the jaw or mylohyoideus or decussate with a similar slip on opposite side; anterior belly may be absent and posterior belly inserted into the middle of the jaw or hyoid bone. The tendon may pass in front, more rarely behind the Stylohoideus. The mentohyoideus muscle passes from the body of hyoid bone to chin. Anterior view of digastric muscle =Triangles= The Digastricus divides the anterior triangle of the neck into three smaller triangles. * (1) the submandibular triangle (also called the digastric triangle), bounded above by the lower border of the body of the mandible, and a line drawn from its angle to the sternocleidomastoideus, below by the posterior belly of the digastricus and the stylohyoideus, in front by the anterior belly of the diagastricus; * (2) the carotid triangle, bounded above by the posterior belly of the digastricus and stylohyoideus, behind by the sternocleidomastoideus, below by the omohyoideus; * (3) the suprahyoid or submental triangle, bounded laterally by the anterior belly of the digastricus, medially by the middle line of the neck from the hyoid bone to the symphysis menti, and inferiorly by the body of the hyoid bone. * (4) The inferior carotid triangle (or muscular triangle), is bounded, in front, by the median line of the neck from the hyoid bone to the sternum; behind, by the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoideus; above, by the superior belly of the omohyoideus Function The digastric muscle is involved in any complex jaw action such as speaking, swallowing, chewing and breathing. When the digastric muscle contracts, it acts to elevate the hyoid bone. If the hyoid is being held in place (by the infrahyoid muscles), it will tend to depress the mandible (open the mouth). Other animals The digastric muscles are present in a variety of animals, specific attachment sites may vary. For example, in the Orangutan, the posterior digastric attaches to the mandible rather than the hyoid.

When the encoder finds such a match, it substitutes a reference to the string's position in the data structure.  Methods and applications  Some dictionary coders use a 'static dictionary', one whose full set of strings is determined before coding begins and does not change during the coding process. This approach is most often used when the message or set of messages to be encoded is fixed and large; for instance, an application that stores the contents of a book in the limited storage space of a PDA generally builds a static dictionary from a concordance of the text and then uses that dictionary to compress the verses. This scheme of using Huffman coding to represent indices into a concordance has been called \\"Huffword\\".Ian H. Witten, Alistair Moffat, and Timothy C. Bell. Managing Gigabytes. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1994. . In a related and more general method, a dictionary is built from redundancy extracted from a data environment (various input streams) which dictionary is then used statically to compress a further input stream. For example, a dictionary is built from old English texts then is used to compress a book.Rodney J. Smith. Streaming Compression System Using Dynamic Connection Groups, US patent 5,748,955, priority date 20 December 1993. More common are methods where the dictionary starts in some predetermined state but the contents change during the encoding process, based on the data that has already been encoded. Both the LZ77 and LZ78 algorithms work on this principle. In LZ77, a circular buffer called the \\"sliding window\\" holds the last N bytes of data processed. This window serves as the dictionary, effectively storing every substring that has appeared in the past N bytes as dictionary entries. Instead of a single index identifying a dictionary entry, two values are needed: the length, indicating the length of the matched text, and the offset (also called the distance), indicating that the match is found in the sliding window starting offset bytes before the current text. LZ78 uses a more explicit dictionary structure; at the beginning of the encoding process, the dictionary is empty. An index value of zero is used to represent the end of a string, so the first index of the dictionary is one. At each step of the encoding process, if there is no match, then the last matching index (or zero) and character are both added to the dictionary and output to the compressed stream. If there is a match, then the working index is updated to the matching index, and nothing is output. LZW is similar to LZ78, but, the dictionary is initialized to all possible symbols. The typical implementation works with 8 bit symbols, so the dictionary \\"codes\\" for hex 00 to hex FF (decimal 255) are pre-defined. Dictionary entries would be added starting with code value hex 100. Unlike LZ78, if a match is not found (or if the end of data), then only the dictionary code is output. This creates a potential issue since the decoder output is one step behind the dictionary. Refer to LZW for how this is handled. Enhancements to LZW include handing symbol sizes other than 8 bits and having reserved codes to reset the dictionary and to indicate end of data.

As a player, he played for the India national cricket team between 1981 and 1992 in both Tests and ODIs. Although he started his career as a left arm spin bowler, he later transformed into a batting all-rounder. As a batsman, Shastri was essentially defensive with his trademark \\"chapati shot\\" (a flick off the pads), but he could raise his strike rate when required. Due to his above-average height (he stood 6' 3\\" tall) and an upright stance, he had a limited number of shots against fast bowling, but was able to put the lofted shot to good use against spin bowling. Ravi played either as an opening batsman or in the middle order. The highlight of his career was when he was elected Champion of Champions in the World Championship of Cricket in Australia in 1985.

On 16 August 2019, he was re-appointed as the head coach of the senior men's Indian team and will remain in charge until the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup.  Personal life  Ravi Shastri is of Mangalorean descent, was born in Bombay and studied at Don Bosco High School, Matunga. As a teenager, he took to cricket seriously. Playing for Don Bosco (Matunga), Shastri reached the final of the 1976 inter-school Giles Shield, finally losing to St Mary's, whose lineup included two future Ranji players, Shishir Hattangadi and Jignesh Sanghani. The next year, under Shastri's captaincy, Don Bosco won the Giles Shield in 1977, the first time in the history of that school. At school, his coach was B.D. Desai, once a Tatas and Dadar Union player. While Don Bosco was not traditionally a major force in schools cricket, the R.A. Podar College, where Shastri later studied commerce, produced many good cricketers. Vasant Amladi and, in particular, VS \\"Marshall\\" Patil, were integral figures in Shastri's development as a cricketer. Domestic career In his last year at the junior college, he was selected to represent the Bombay team in the Ranji Trophy.Javed Akhtar, The Young Veteran, Interview with Ravi Shastri, World of Cricket, April 1986 At 17 years and 292 days, he was then the youngest cricketer to play for Bombay. Ravi Shastri's career performance graph An Indian under‚Äì19 team was scheduled to tour Pakistan in 1980‚Äì81. Shastri was included in the coaching camp at the last minute by the National Coach Hemu Adhikari. Shastri captained one of the two teams in a trial game and was then asked to lead the Indian Under-19 team. The tour, however, was cancelled. The team later went to Sri Lanka, but the games were frequently interrupted by rain.Pradeep Vijayakar, Cricketer of the Year article, Indian Cricket 1981 His only notable achievement in his first two Ranji seasons were bowling figures of 6-61, which he took against Delhi in the 1979‚Äì80 Ranji final that Bombay lost. While he was playing against Uttar Pradesh at Kanpur in the next season, he was called up to the squad touring New Zealand to stand in for the injured left arm spinner Dilip Doshi. Shastri arrived in Wellington the night before the first Test. His first over in Test cricket was a maiden to the New Zealand captain Geoff Howarth. In the second innings, he took 3 wickets in four balls, all to catches by Dilip Vengsarkar, to bring a quick close to the New Zealand innings. In the third Test, his seven wickets won him the man of the match award, while his 15 wickets in the series were the highest for either side. The Ranji final of 1984/85 turned out to be one of the finest matches in Indian domestic cricket history. A sleepy Gavaskar won the toss and batted. He could hardly close his eyes before Bombay was 3 down for 42. Batting at No.5, he scored his 20th and last Ranji Trophy hundred and took Bombay to 333. Shastri made 29 before he was bowled attempting to cut an arm‚Äìball. Delhi was in early trouble before they were rescued by Chetan Chauhan, batting with a fractured finger in his last first class match. Ajay Sharma, in his first season, scored a hundred and took Delhi into the lead with nine wickets down. The rules of the competition specified that in the event of a draw, the team with the first innings lead would be declared the winners. With two days and 100 minutes left, Bombay went for quick runs. A crowd of about 46,000 turned up for match on the fourth day and the organizers ran out of tickets. Shastri top scored with 76 as Bombay set Delhi 300 to win in a day and ninety minutes. Except for the odd delivery, the ball spun slowly and afforded enough time for the batsmen to play their strokes. Early on the final day, Delhi reached 95 for no loss and then collapsed. His first wicket was Chauhan who was declared out caught behind with the ball having spun across the face of the bat without apparently touching it. The match changed dramatically and the batsmen lost their head. Gursharan Singh was lbw playing no stroke, Kirti Azad played on, Surinder Khanna was stumped after a few slogs. Shastri took 8 for 91; Bombay won by 90 runs. In the 50th year of Ranji trophy, it was their 30th title.Ayaz Memon, \\"Bombay pull off a remarkable win\\", Sportsweek, 17‚Äì23 April 1985 After the tour of Australia in 1985‚Äì86, he also began to decline as a bowler. Bombay lost to Haryana in the semifinal of the Ranji trophy but West Zone won the Duleep Trophy. His major contribution was as a bowler in the semifinal against North Zone on a flat wicket at Trivandrum. Like in the Ranji final, North looked the likely winner going into the last day, before he took 8 for 145. He scored hundreds in the quarterfinal and semifinal of the Duleep trophy, but West Zone lost to South on first innings lead in the latter match. Shastri's only other score over fifty in the season was a particularly dull 125 against Pakistan in the Jaipur Test. He did well enough to be the man of the one day series. In the first one-day match against Pakistan he captained India for the first time, scoring 50 and taking three wickets. He took four wickets at Calcutta and 69* at Hyderabad in two thrilling finishes. Later at Nagpur with India facing a big target, he scored 52 in 40 balls. In 1987, Glamorgan contracted Shastri to play for them. He stayed with them until 1991, with a break in 1990 due to India's tour of England. Shastri's presence did little for the fortunes of the county which finished at the bottom of the first class table in two of those seasons. Shastri topped 1000 runs in 1989 and scored hundreds in both innings against Middlesex. His best bowling performance of 7 for 49 (11 for 90) in the match came against Lancashire in 1988, where he got bounce and turn and was 'unplayable' according to Wisden. The almanack noticed that Shastri was already becoming reluctant to bowl. 1988 was by far the best of the seasons for Glamorgan in one day matches. They finished 5th in the Sunday League ‚Äì up from 14 in 1987 ‚Äì and reached the semifinal of the Benson & Hedges Cup. Shastri won the leading six hitter award for the Sunday league matches of 1988 with 14 sixes. He was part of the MCC team that played a Rest of the World team in the MCC bicentennial match at Lord's in 1987. Bombay breezed through the West Zone league of the 1993‚Äì94 Ranji Trophy winning all four matches ‚Äì a very rare featIndian Cricket 1994. Indian Cricket goes on to say that 1993‚Äì4 was the first time that a team won all its matches in the West Zone league but it certainly is not true. Gujarat in 1977-78 is an earlier instance of a team winning all four of its West Zone matches. ‚Äì by big margins. With the Test players away, Shastri captained the young team in the knockout matches. Bombay defeated Haryana by an innings and 202 runs in the pre quarter final but ran into trouble against Karnataka in the next round. Against 406, Bombay lost their first six for 174, before Shastri and Sairaj Bahutule added 259 in six hours. Shastri's individual score was 151. Bombay survived the best part of the last day to win on first innings lead. Shastri scored 612 runs in the season and took 17 wickets at 15. Bombay went on to beat Bengal in a low scoring final to lift the Ranji Trophy. It was their first championship since the famous win against Delhi nine years ago. In September 1994, while in Sri Lanka covering the Singer World Series, Shastri announced his retirement from first class cricket. International career =Early days= Within eighteen months of his Test debut, Shastri had moved up from tenth position in the batting order to being an opening batsman. \\"His calm, sensible batting lower in the order\\", wrote Wisden, commenting on his first series, \\"raised promise of his developing into a useful all-rounder, and his fielding too was an asset\\". By the end of his career, he had batted in every position from one to ten. By his own admission, he ignored his bowling in favour of his batting. This was reflected in his performances. However, his figures of 9-101 in the season-opening 1981 Irani Trophy stood as a tournament record for nearly twenty years. It was the failure of the regular openers Pranab Roy and Ghulam Parkar that led to Shastri being made to open at the Oval against England in 1982. He distinguished himself by scoring 66 runs in that match. An injury in the webbing of his hand ruled him out of four of the Tests to be played in Pakistan. Forced again to open in the final Test at Karachi, against the fast bowling of Imran Khan (then at the peak of his career), he scored his first Test hundred. He later made another hundred against the West Indies in Antigua. Indian Cricket was impressed enough to suggest that, given time, he could become one of the best batsmen in the Indian team.Indian Cricket 1983, p.3, in the review of the tour of West Indies Shastri was not selected to play in most of the important matches in the 1983 World Cup. In the series against the West Indies later that year, he again distinguished himself with his bold effort in batting against the domineering West Indian pace bowlers. =The glorious winter= In October 1984, India toured Pakistan for the third time in six years. The Lahore Test saw India collapse to 156 against Pakistan's 428, and follow on. India went into the last day trailing by 92 with six wickets in hand but were saved by a fifth wicket partnership of 126 between Shastri and Mohinder Amarnath. Shastri scored 71, while Amarnath made 101*. Shastri was even more successful in the next Test at Faisalabad, where he scored 139 and shared a stand of 200 with Sandip Patil. The last Test and the remainder of the tour were cancelled because of the assassination of Indira Gandhi. There were already signals that Shastri was being groomed as a future captain. Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar was coming to the end of his career and Kapil Dev, who had led India in the previous season, was expected to succeed him. Shastri appeared to be the next in line. He led the Young India side to Zimbabwe in early 1984. Against the touring English side in November, he led the India Under‚Äì25 to an innings win - the first defeat of England in a tour match in India for fifty years. Around this time, Shastri also began to open the innings regularly in one day games. He scored 102 against Australia in October ‚Äì India's second hundred in ODIs ‚Äì and made the same score against England at Cuttack in December. Shastri had stood in for Gavaskar and opened with Srikkanth in two matches of the 1983 World Cup. The third time that they opened was at Cuttack and they set a world record of 188 for the first wicket. Later in the season, this partnership was to form the foundation for the Indian triumph in the WCC in Australia. Shastri's success continued in Test matches against England. In the Bombay Test his 235 run stand with wicket-keeper Syed Kirmani led to victory for India. His 142 improved upon the 139 at Faisalabad as his highest score. In the third Test at Kolkata, Shastri made 111 in 357 balls and 455 minutes, though his innings was heavily interrupted by rain. With Mohammad Azharuddin he added 214 for the fifth wicket, another Indian record. When India started the second innings late in the final day, he was sent in to open, thus becoming one of the few batsmen to bat on all five days of a Test. Shastri set another record for Bombay against Baroda in a West Zone Ranji match. His first hundred came up in 72 minutes and 80 balls and included nine fours and four sixes. The second took just 41 minutes and 43 balls. His 123 ball, 113-minute 200* became the fastest double hundred in first class history, beating the previous record by 7 minutes, and included 13 fours and 13 sixes. Six of the sixes came off a single over of the left arm spinner Tilak Raj. In terms of the number of sixes, it bettered the 58-year-old Indian record of CK Nayudu who had struck 11 sixes against a touring MCC team at Bombay Gymkhana in 1926‚Äì7. Shastri's unfinished sixth wicket stand of 204* with Ghulam Parkar, who contributed only 33 to the partnership, took only 83 minutes. In Baroda's second innings, Shastri took two wickets in four overs.Indian Cricket 1985 =World Championship of Cricket - 1985= Except for a few series in Pakistan and the 1983 World Cup final, the World Championship of Cricket in Australia was the first time overseas cricket matches were shown live in India. The WCC saw India win every match convincingly. The WCC was conceived as a celebration of the 150th year of the formation of Victoria, but the finalists turned out to be India and Pakistan.Sunil Gavaskar, One day wonders Shastri had a slow start to the tournament but finished with fifties in the last three matches. Srikkanth too scored three fifties and India posted century opening stands against Australia and in the final. India went in with two spinners for every match. It helped that all the matches were played at Melbourne and Sydney which have turning tracks and long boundaries. Sivaramakrishnan and Shastri claimed 18 wickets between them in five matches. For his 182 runs and 8 wickets, Shastri was chosen as the man of the series which in this tournament was called 'The Champion of Champions'. He won an Audi 100 car for his efforts. By the special order of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Indian customs waived the heavy duty its import would have normally entailed.The Age, 19 March 1985 =Vice-Captaincy 1985= Two weeks later India won the Rothman's cup in Sharjah beating Pakistan and Australia. The victory against Pakistan was particularly memorable because India defended a total of only 125. Shastri and Siva continued their successful partnership with the ball. It was for this tournament that Shastri served as the Indian vice captain for the first time. Gavaskar had announced his decision to resign his captaincy at the end of the WCC before the tournament began.The Age, 14 February 1985 Before the final, former Australian captain Ian Chappell suggested that for the good of Indian cricket, Gavaskar should continue as the captain till Shastri could take over from him.David McMahon, Interview with Shastri, Sportsworld 24‚Äì30 April 1985 Shastri continued as vice captain to Kapil Dev in the 1985‚Äì86 season. This season and the England tour of 1986 were ordinary ones for him. Australia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan toured India in 1986‚Äì87. Shastri played a crucial role in the Tied Test at Madras against Australia, scoring 62 and 48*. When Indian middle order collapsed and India fell behind the run rate, his two sixes in quick succession off off‚Äìspinner Greg Matthews came in handy. In the final Test at Bombay he scored 121*. As was becoming increasingly common, it was played in first and fourth gear. He hung around for around 30 minutes for the last run for his fifty and twice as long in the nineties. Yet he hit six sixes, three of which came after he completed his hundred. The huge six off left arm fast bowler Bruce Reid ‚Äì a cross batted heave that went over longon ‚Äì was particularly memorable. Six sixes in an innings was an Indian record at the time. But he was outshone by Dilip Vengsarkar who scored 164* in the same innings. They added a record 298* for the sixth wicket. In early 1987, he presented a 15-minute coaching series which went by the name 'That's Cricket'. This was aired on the national channel Doordarshan on Sunday mornings. There were even rumours of an involvement with actress Amrita Singh. India lost the final Test at Bangalore to lose the 1986‚Äì87 series against Pakistan. Kapil Dev was widely criticised in the media for his captaincy. The selectors retained him as captain in the Reliance World Cup at the beginning of the 1987‚Äì88 season. Shastri failed with the bat in the Reliance Cup but formed a successful bowling partnership with Maninder Singh, another left arm spinner. India topped its group but went down to England in the semifinal. Kapil Dev received more criticisms for skying a catch to deep midwicket when a win was still a possibility. =Captaincy issues 1987= About this time, Vengsarkar emerged as the strongest candidate to take over from Kapil. He had had a dream run with the bat, starting from the series in England in 1986. In 1987, the newly established Deloitte ratings (the forerunner of the current LG ratings) ranked him the best batsman in the world. The Indian selectors have conventionally leaned towards making the best player of the team the captain. So before the home series against West Indies, Kapil was sacked and Vengsarkar was made the Indian captain. Vengsarkar had his left arm fractured in the third Test and Shastri captained India for the only time in his Test career. On an underprepared turning track in Madras, India won the toss and elected to bat first. Debutant Narendra Hirwani took 16 for 136 as India won by 255 runs to draw the series 1‚Äì1. Apart from this, Shastri did little with bat or ball. West Indies won 7 of the eight one day matches, he was the captain in six of them. Vengsarkar meanwhile picked up a six-month ban from BCCI for writing newspaper columns. So Shastri continued as the captain for a three nations tournament in Sharjah in April. Sri Lanka and New Zealand were the other teams and India won easily. =Sacking and vice captaincy 1989= India travelled to West Indies in early 1989. Though a failure overall, Shastri played the best innings by either side in the series. It came at Bridgetown in the second Test. India trailed by 56 in the first innings and lost the six second innings wickets for 63. Batting at No.3, Shastri was last out for a courageous 107 out of 251 all out. Looking back at the end of his career, he was to consider this his finest innings. The bowlers were Malcolm Marshall, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh and Ian Bishop and the pitch, difficult. On the way back many of the Indian players took part in an exhibition match in United States. BCCI suspended the players. Though the suspension was later revoked, Vengsarkar was sacked. Srikkanth became the new captain and Shastri, yet again, the deputy. After an indifferent series in Pakistan, both were excluded from the tour of New Zealand in 1990. Azharuddin led an experimental team which a selector called the 'team of the nineties'. Within a few weeks, the phrase got the status of a joke. Shastri was recalled for the tour to England that summer as the vice-captain. =The Indian summer= Shastri's career generally remained a struggle till the England tour of 1990 where he scored two hundreds in the three Test rubber. Opening the innings for India, he began with an even 100 in India's reply to a huge England score at Lord's. It was a hard-working innings and Shastri played and missed often with most of the runs came with his usual flicks and nudges. Towards the end of his innings, he grew aggressive, reaching his hundred by hitting the English off-spinner Eddie Hemmings for two fours and a six in an over, and departed immediately attempting another big hit. He topped this with 187 at the Oval. Journalist and commentator Harsha Bhogle's description of this innings holds true for many of Shastri's major efforts:Harsha Bhogle, The Joy of a Lifetime : India's tour of England 1990 :Watching Shastri bat is like admiring the Qutub Minar; tall, timeless, solid. You admire it for the virtues, not for its style. For nine hours and 21 minutes, he chiselled away the England attack and the sculpture that he left behind represented perseverance and craft. There was the usual stoic, expressionless face under the helmet, but you could see the determination in his eyes as he planted himself at the wicket, struck root and bore fruit. : Only occasionally, the bat wavered in its resolve but the mind put it on the right path again, almost in admonishment, and the bat grew broader and straighter ... He may never be a Gavaskar, but he at least represents the great man's virtues, even if by proxy. It would be a relief too, to know that he will never throw away his wicket for nobody guards his crease more fiercely. Following the innings at Oval, Shastri scored his career best score of 217 in the Irani trophy in the opening match of the Indian season and a top score of 88 on a very bad wicket in the Chandigarh Test against Sri Lanka. He carried his bat for 101* against the same opponents in a one-day match a week later, reaching the hundred with a two off the last ball. Next year in South Africa's first-ever ODI series on their return to international cricket, he scored 109 at Delhi, his fourth and last one day hundred. A series of abandoned tours meant India played few matches at home at this time. At the end of 1991, India travelled to Australia for a five Test series, to be followed by the World Cup. Channel 9 dubbed it the Indian Summer. The series was a disaster for India ‚Äì they lost four of the Tests ‚Äì and was rife with umpiring controversies. But it also saw the final flourishes in the careers of Shastri and Kapil Dev. Shastri took 5 wickets for 15 runs against Australia in an early match in the World Series Cup. It was then the best bowling figures by an Indian in ODIs. Most of the wickets were gratuitously earned, though ‚Äì three batsmen were caught on the legside boundary and another stumped. In the third Test at Sydney, he scored his only double hundred in Test cricket, the first by an Indian against Australia. He was dropped in the sixties by the Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne, who was making his debut, off his own bowling. Amidst frequent interruptions by rain, he completed his hundred early on the fourth day and a six off Warne brought up the 150. He finally fell to a tired shot at Warne after nine and a half hours, scoring 206 with 17 fours and the two sixes, thus becoming Warne's first Test wicket. It was also during this innings that the knee injury that would soon end his career appeared for the first time. India had gone into the match with four pace bowlers and no regular spinners. Shastri was little more than a part-time bowler by this time. By the final day, pitch started taking spin. Shastri took four wickets in the second innings and Australia just about beat the clock to draw the match. India could well have won the match with another spinner.Wisden 1992 (accessed 25 June 2005)Cricinfo match reports of India in Australia 1991/2 (accessed 25 June 2005) Ravi Shastri in 2015 =Late career= The remaining WSC matches followed the Sydney Test. In the second final against Australia Shastri worsened the knee injury. At the later stages of the innings he was forced to stand and slog. After a few quick runs, it ended in an inevitable mishit to cover. He missed the remaining two Test matches, both of which India lost. For a while it seemed doubtful that he would be able to play the World Cup which was being hosted by Australia and New Zealand, but was included at the last moment. In their second match, India chased 238 to win in 50 overs against Australia. A rain interruption meant that the target was revised to 236 in 47 overs. Shastri took 67 balls for his 25; India went on to lose by one run. He was blamed for the defeat and dropped from the remaining matches of the tournament. In the next season, South Africa hosted India for their first ever tour. Shastri opened in all four Tests and struggled to score runs. The only bright spot was a 16 ball 27 not out, in India's one day win at Centurion park. He had batted down the order in the one day matches of this series. In reference to the World Cup innings against Australia, he commented later that for once he knew what his exact role was. India hosted England immediately after the South Africa series. The knee injury returned before the series and put Shastri out of cricket for eight months. He never again represented India in international cricket. Post-retirement On 18 March 1990, Shastri married Ritu Singh.Harsha Bhogle, \\"Howzat ! Ritu Singh appealed and Ravi Shastri walked up the aisle\\", Sportsworld, 4‚Äì10 April 1990, pp. 30-31 He made his debut as a TV commentator with the World Masters Tournament in Mumbai in March 1995. In 2003, he collaborated in starting up Showdiff Worldwide, a celebrity management company. He has since served ICC and BCCI in temporary official capacities and as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Some of his temporary shows, such as Super Spells, still run Star Sports and related channels. He and fellow commentator Sunil Gavaskar ended their long-term associations with ESPN-STAR Sports in April 2008 as they were contracted by the BCCI as commentators for lucrative Indian Premier League which was broadcast by rival network Sony Max. 2008 also held great significance for Shastri as he became the father of Aleka at the age of 46. He temporarily coached the Indian cricket team for their 2007 Bangladesh tour. He was named the Celebrity Torchbearer for the Oman Leg of the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay. Coaching career On July 2017 Shastri, the former team director, was appointed as Head Coach for the national side by the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC), comprising Sourav Ganguly , Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman. The contract has him getting paid Rs. 8 crore per year. Rs. 1.5 Crore more than his predecessor Anil Kumble. As the World cup 2019 was in progress, on 13 June, the BCCI announced an extension of Shastri's contract by 45 days after the tournament. On 16 August 2019, he was re-appointed as the head coach of the senior men's Indian team, with his new contract extending up to the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup in India.

For example, the noun green in golf (referring to a putting-green) is derived ultimately from the adjective green. Conversions from adjectives to nouns and vice versa are both very common and unnotable in English; much more remarked upon is the creation of a verb by converting a noun or other word (e.g., the adjective clean becomes the verb to clean). Verbification  Verbification, or verbing, is the creation of a verb from a noun, adjective or other word. =Verb conversion in English= In English, verbification typically involves simple conversion of a non-verb to a verb. The verbs to verbify and to verb, the first by derivation with an affix and the second by zero derivation, are themselves products of verbification (see autological word), and, as might be guessed, the term to verb is often used more specifically, to refer only to verbification that does not involve a change in form. (Verbing in this specific sense is therefore a kind of anthimeria.) Examples of verbification in the English language number in the thousands, including some of the most common words such as mail and e-mail, strike, talk, salt, pepper, switch, bed, sleep, ship, train, stop, drink, cup, lure, mutter, dress, dizzy, divorce, fool, merge, to be found on virtually every page in the dictionary. Thus, verbification is by no means confined to slang and has furnished English with countless new expressions: \\"access\\", as in \\"access the file\\", which was previously only a noun, as in \\"gain access to the file\\". Similar mainstream examples include \\"host\\", as in \\"host a party\\", and \\"chair\\", as in \\"chair the meeting\\". Other formations, such as \\"gift\\", are less widespread but nevertheless mainstream. Verbification may have a bad reputation with some English users because it is such a potent source of neologisms. Although some neologistic products of verbification may meet considerable opposition from prescriptivist authorities (the verb sense of impact is a well-known example), most such derivations have become so central to the language after several centuries of use that they no longer draw notice. In many cases, the verbs were distinct from their noun counterparts in Old English, and regular sound change has made them the same form: these can be reanalysed as conversion. \\"Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk\\" is an example of a sentence using those forms. =Other languages= In other languages, verbification is a more regular process. However, such processes often do not qualify as conversion, as they involve changes in the form of the word. For example, in Esperanto, any word can be transformed into a verb, either by altering its ending to -i, or by applying suffixes such as -igi and -iƒùi; and in Semitic languages, the process often involves changes of internal vowels, such as the Hebrew word \\"◊í◊í◊ú\\" (, ), from the proper noun ◊í◊ï◊í◊ú (). Noun conversion in English Many English nouns are formed from unmodified verbs: a fisherman's catch, to go for a walk, etc.Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, September 2009, s.v. Humor Verbification is sometimes used to create nonce words or joking words. In other cases, simple conversion is involved, as with formations like beer, as in beer me (\\"give me a beer\\") and eye, as in eye it (\\"look at it\\"). Sometimes, a verbified form can occur with a prepositional particle, e.g., sex as in sex it up (\\"make it sexier\\"). A Calvin and Hobbes strip dealt with this phenomenon, concluding with the statement that \\"Verbing weirds language\\",Watterson, Bill (1993). Calvin and Hobbes January 25, 1993. \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\". demonstrating the verbing of both verb and weird. (The former appears in its use as a gerund.)

Design and development The R.I was unusual for a multi-engined aircraft in that rather than connecting propellers directly to the engines and mounting the engines in nacelles, the R.I carried all its engines within the fuselage and turned its propellers via a system of drive shafts. A single prototype was completed and flew in 1916. Initial flights were quite successful, the aircraft being considered very manoeuvrable, but on 3 September 1918, a newly assembled propeller, which had not been given sufficient time for glue to cure, disintegrated. The vibrations resulting from that failure caused the complex transmissions and shafting connecting all four engines to both propellers to tear loose, which then cut a center section strut, resulting in the breakup of the aircraft, killing all seven crew on board. Of the seven further AEG R.1 aircraft planned or under production when the war ended, (R.21, R.22, R.59, R.60, R.61, R.62, R.63 and R.64), only R.21 was finished and R.22 partially complete.

Historically a separate village centred on Chaddesden Hall and the 14th century St Mary's Church, the area was significantly expanded by 20th century housing developments, and was incorporated into Derby in 1968. History There is evidence of Roman settlement such as Nottingham Road, a Roman road. The old village, recorded in Domesday Book as \\"Cedesene\\",Domesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. p.1326 is situated two and a half miles east of the city. In 1086 it was a manor in the possession of Henry de FerrersDomesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. p.748 and was worth the sum of three pounds. The focal point of the village is probably the ancient church of St Mary's. It is important as a dated example of church architecture before the advent of the perpendicular style. It was rebuilt by Henry Chaddesden, Archdeacon of Leicester, around 1357. The tall and spacious chancel running from its nave and aisle, dates from this period. Its west tower is perpendicular in style with its big west door and window. Restoration work on the chancel was carried out in 1857 by G. Place. The Corporation of Derby acquired much of the land when it came up for sale in the 1930s by the Wilmot family, and started to build houses on it. The shopping area on Nottingham Road was developed around the same time as was Chaddesden Park Hotel. Chaddesden soon became the largest suburb of Derby. Government The area is covered by the Chaddesden ward of Derby City Council. The ward has three councillors, elected in successive years. Following the May 2019 elections, the ward has three Conservative councillors. Chaddesden has been part of the Derby North parliamentary constituency since the seat's creation in 1950. Chaddesden was formerly a civil parish within Shardlow Rural District before being absorbed by the then county borough of Derby.  Geography  Chaddesden lies to the east of Derby city centre, with the A52 road forming its southern boundary. It is bordered by the wards of Spondon, Oakwood and Derwent with Erewash to the north. The Chaddesden Brook runs southwest through Chaddesden Park towards the River Derwent.  Demography  The population at the 2011 census was 13,413, with 93.7% White British (compared to 75.3% for Derby as a whole).  Economy  The area is primarily residential, with some retail development. Wyvern Retail Park has a Sainsbury's superstore incorporating an Argos store, Homebase, Halfords, Boots, Carpetright, Next, Tapi, Home Bargains, Costa Drive-Thru and a 24 Hour McDonald's. The Food Warehouse by Iceland is due to open a store at the retail park in October 2020. https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/new-iceland-megastore-open- wyvern-4396763  Culture and community  Public facilities in Chaddesden include a public library, and a park. Chaddesden village centre has many amenities including a Tesco Express, Aldi, Pizza Hut, Lidl and locally famous 3 Chefs takeaway plus numerous other takeaways including Chinese, Indian and Fish and Chips, an estate agency, chemist, vets, travel agent, newsagent, hairdresser, optician, two public houses and a 29-bedroom hotel. Chaddesden Wood and Lime Lane Wood have been designated a Local Nature Reserve.  Landmarks  The Wilmot family lived at Chaddesden Hall, which was demolished in the 1920s when the Wilmot family sold its estate. The grounds are a well used park. The lodge and the entrance to the grave yard on Nottingham Road were designed by H. I. Stevens around 1854. The Wilmot family name still appears in the names of local businesses, including the Wilmot Service Station on Morley Road and the Wilmot Arms Public House at the junction of Morley Road, Chaddesden Lane and Wood Road.  Transport  There is a bus service on Nottingham Road, and cycling Regional Route 66 passes through the area. Derby railway station is away.  Education  Schools in Chaddesden include Lees Brook Community School (secondary school/college), Chaddesden Park Primary School, Cherrytree Hill Primary School, Meadowfarm School, Cavendish Close School and Roe Farm Primary School.  Religious sites  St Mary's Church was rebuilt by Henry Chaddesden, Archdeacon of Leicester, in approximately 1347; the chancel dates from this period. It has an ornate rood screen and an unusual chalice shaped font, believed to be over 600 years old. There are monuments to the Wilmot family who were local landlords. In the church yard is a small mound, where six almshouses used to stand. They had been founded by Robert Wilmot. St. Mark's Church on Francis Street was built in 1938 by Naylor & Sale, and St. Philip's Church on Taddington Road was built in 1955 by S.W. Milburn to service an ever-expanding population. The bell in St. Philip's came from Derwent Woodlands church in Derwent village, which was \\"drowned\\" in the 1940s with the building of Ladybower Reservoir (near Bamford).  Sport  There is a children's play area in the park as well as facilities for sports like cricket and football. Lees Brook School is a specialist school of physical education, and also contains facilities for the children.  Notable people  Colonel Sir Henry Wilmot received the VC for bravery. He was born and is buried here.Derbyshire at VictoriaCross.org Accessed June 2007 Sir Henry Fowler Railway Engineer, buried in the Nottingham Road Cemetery.
