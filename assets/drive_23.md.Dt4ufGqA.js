Career Marsh grew up in Sedgley and was a pupil at Queen Victoria Primary School and then Dormston School. He began his footballing career as a trainee with Walsall in 1986, joining the club on leaving school, and went on to make 470 appearances in thirteen seasons. He helped the club to promotion in 1995 and 1999. He played primarily as a fullback but, due to his versatility, played in virtually every position on the field for Walsall. In January 2001, feeling that he had gone stale, he requested a transfer and joined Wycombe Wanderers in March 2001 for a transfer fee of ¬£30,000. After only six months at Wycombe, he joined Northampton Town for a fee of ¬£10,000 on a two-year contract, saying, \\"It has been a strange experience for me.

Early life She was born in Ireland: nothing is known about her childhood, including her birth name. Comments by Jonathan Swift, who was at Trinity College Dublin with her husband, suggest that she grew up in conditions of poverty and obscurity. She married Peter Davys, master of the free school of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, and had two daughters both of whom seem to have died in infancy. Despite her lack of family connections she had a number of socially prominent friends, including Margaret Walker, daughter of Sir John Jeffreyson, judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland). After being widowed in 1698, she moved to London in 1700 in order to make a living. Writing career She published The Amours of Alcippus and Lucippe, with a dedication to Margaret Walker, in 1704, and \\"The Fugitive,\\" dedicated to Esther Johnson (Swift's beloved friend \\"Stella\\") , in 1705. She claims in the Introduction to \\"The Works of Mrs. Davys\\" (1725) that she abandoned \\"The Amours\\" while in press to go north, probably to York. In 1716, she returned to London for the production of her play, The Northern Heiress, or the Humours of York, a comedy critical of the marriage market. Initially produced in York in 1715, it debuted at Lincoln's Inn Fields. The production ran for the three nights, giving her the receipts for the author's benefit night. She spent some more time in London, hoping to be a successful city writer; \\"Familiar Letters Betwixt a Gentleman and a Lady\\" was probably published at this time, although not published until \\"The Works\\" (1725). In about 1718 she abandoned that hope. The note \\"As it was to be performed at the Drury Lane Theatre\\" on the title page of \\"The Self-Rivals\\" indicates a disappointment. Instead she moved to Cambridge, where she established a coffee house. Her chief patrons were the students at St. John's College, Cambridge, whom she thanks in her prefaces for their help. In Cambridge, she turned to writing novels, for which she is best known. The Reform'd Coquet is a successful early example of the novel of education, and her Familiar Letters, an epistolary novel which satirised the upper classes and political affiliations, is an example of a successful epistolary novel before Samuel Richardson. Her writing is often direct, even blunt: for example, Sir John Galliard, the main character in The accomplish'd Rake, a debauched womanizer, is presented without euphemism. She was attacked in The Grub-Street Journal in 1731 for being \\"bawdy\\" but she \\"replied with vigour.\\"Blain et al. 272 Later life She lived in Cambridge until her death after a period of ill health. Her response to the satirical letter in \\"The Grub Street Journal\\" refers to shaking hands and bad eyesight. She was buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Cambridge on July 5, 1732.

It was purchased by VF Corporation, a NYSE listed entity in 2018. Icebreaker was conceived and designed around the philosophy of sustainability, using natural fibres, environmental and social ethics, and animal welfare. The company began by specialising in the creation of merino base layers and now offers underwear, mid layers, outer wear, socks and accessories based on natural fibers. Icebreaker was founded in 1995 by Jeremy Moon, and now supplies its clothing to more than 4,700 stores in 50 countries.  History Icebreaker started when, in 1994, an American girlfriend introduced Jeremy Moon, then 24, to a merino wool farmer she had stayed with as she backpacked around New Zealand. Brian and Fiona Brakenridge lived on the remote Pohuenui Island in Marlborough with their two sons Ben and Sam and 5,000 sheep. They had developed some prototype thermal underwear made from 100% pure New Zealand merino wool, a fibre that was then of such little value that it was sold at low cost to be blended with traditional wool. Icebreaker began selling its products in New Zealand, followed by Australia. The company has been growing in Europe and acquiring its distributors there.\\"Icebreaker acquires distributor, launches new European subsidiaries\\". Portland Business Journal. 19 August 2008 In 2010, one in every three Icebreaker garments is now sold in Europe, now one of Icebreaker's largest markets. In 2010 company sales were approximately $100 million. In 2014 company sales were approximately $200 million. The company's first United States headquarters were in Santa Barbara, California and then in Sun Valley, Idaho. It moved offices to Portland, Oregon\\"Icebreaker relocation heats up apparel scene\\". Portland Business Journal. 17 November 2007 in 2007 and, in December 2008 combined its U.S. sales and marketing office with its global design studio at a new headquarters at 1330 NW 14th Avenue in Portland, which is Gold certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating system established by the U.S. Green Building Council.\\"A natural Icebreaker\\". Portland Business Journal. 27 March 2009 Icebreaker sells through wholesale channels, retail stores, and its website. It opened its first retail store at the Wellington International Airport in 2005. In 2007, Icebreaker opened its first overseas TouchLab retail stores in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and Portland, Oregon, USA. In 2010, Icebreaker opened its first store in Auckland and its first independent store in Europe, in collaboration with Travel Store SARL as retail partner, at 21st Avenue Michel Croz, Chamonix, Mont-Blanc, France. The company opened its first store in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City in November 2010, to be followed by continued retail expansion. Icebreaker has been the subject of two case studies by Harvard Business School.https://www.hbs.edu/Pages/search.aspx?q=icebreaker. Harvard Business School. In 2009, The New Zealand Herald named Icebreaker's Moon one of the country's top business leaders. Icebreaker has moved its manufacturing from New Zealand to China. It commenced trials to move production to China in 2003 and delivered first product from offshore manufacture in early 2004. Icebreaker then used a phased approach over the following 2‚Äì3 years to ensure impact on NZ manufacturing was minimal. Socks are all manufactured in the USA. After having been on the company's board since July 2012, former Air New Zealand CEO Rob Fyfe started as its executive chairman in September 2013. VF agreed to purchase Icebreaker in 2017. In November 2017, Icebreaker signed a $100 million supply contract with New Zealand merino farmers. Products Icebreaker has developed a merino fibre layering system in multiple weights including: 120 g/m¬≤ Featherweight, 150 g/m¬≤ Ultralite, 200 g/m¬≤ Lightweight, 260 g/m¬≤ Midweight, 320 g/m¬≤ Midlayer and 380 g/m¬≤ Outerlayer. Icebreaker products can be worn solo or layered. Collections include Superfine Lightweight Travel for warm to hot conditions and all season wear; City Lightweight Urban Wear; Icebreaker GT stand alone and insulation layers for active sports such as skiing and snowboarding; Icebreaker GT Running, Road Cycling and Mountain biking lines with Lycra; Bodyfit Active Base Layers for outdoor sports; wind resistant Outer Layers; and Nature underwear for women and Beast underwear for men. The company also makes socks and accessories including headwear, gloves and neckwear. It also has a kids collection. In the Autumn of 2010, Icebreaker introduced Realfleece, which unlike synthetic fleece, is made of merino. Fibre sourcing and manufacturing Icebreaker was conceived and designed around the philosophy of sustainability, using natural fibres, environmental and social ethics, and animal welfare. In August 2008 it launched Icebreaker Baacode, a system that allows consumers to trace the origins of their Icebreaker right to a sheep station (sheep farm) in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, where the merino fibre was grown. Icebreaker merino fabric is certified to Oeko-tex standard 100 Class 1 and Icebreaker factories meet ISO 14001 environmental standards. Icebreaker pioneered long term contracts that pay a significant price premium to selected New Zealand sheep farmers and allow them to carry out long-term planning. In return, contracted growers agree to meet Icebreaker's strict conditions on environmental and social issues, and on animal welfare. Icebreaker is now supplied with merino fibre by 140 high country stations, which cover more than 2 million acres (810,000ha) of New Zealand countryside. In June 2008, Icebreaker signed the biggest wool contract ever in New Zealand, worth approximately US$50 million. The company prohibits the practice of mulesing, which includes the traditional surgical method and the clips method. Mulesing removes strips of skin around the tail to prevent the fly-strike disease, Myiasis. In order to avoid mulesing, sheep that produce Icebreaker merino may be treated through medicines and chemicals for the disease.

He is the younger brother of former Florida Atlantic head coach Carl Pelini, who has frequently worked under Bo as an assistant coach. He served as head coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers from December 2007 until November 2014. He served as head coach of the Youngstown State University football team from 2015 through 2019. Prior to leading the football program at Nebraska, he was the defensive coordinator for the LSU Tigers, Oklahoma Sooners, and the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Playing career Pelini was raised in Youngstown, Ohio, a former center of steel production with a strong athletic tradition. He was nicknamed \\"Bo\\" after former Cleveland Browns running back Bo Scott.Omaha World-Herald NU Football Notes:Asante in bed early (December 29, 2008) After graduating from Youngstown Cardinal Mooney High School (the same high school as Bob Stoops, former head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners), he went on to play free safety for the Buckeyes at Ohio State University under College Football Hall of Fame head coaches Earle Bruce and John Cooper from 1987 to 1990. Pelini started in his last two years, and served as a team co-captain in his senior year, along with Vinnie Clark, Jeff Graham, and Greg Frey. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in business administration from Ohio State College of Business in December 1990. Coaching career =Early career= Following his playing career, Pelini began his coaching career at the University of Iowa as a graduate assistant for the Iowa Hawkeyes under Hayden Fry in 1991. During this period, he also completed his master‚Äôs degree in sports administration from Ohio University in 1992. In 1993, he served for one year as quarterbacks coach at Cardinal Mooney High School in Youngstown. Following the season, Pelini was briefly employed as linebackers coach with the Detroit Drive of the Arena Football League. =San Francisco 49ers= In 1994, Pelini got his first position in the National Football League when he was hired by San Francisco 49ers head coach George Seifert as a scouting assistant. He was quickly promoted to assistant secondary coach, and by the spring of 1994 he had been promoted again to defensive backs coach. In 1995, in his new position, he coached in his first Super Bowl as the 49ers defeated the San Diego Chargers 49‚Äì26 in Super Bowl XXIX. =New England Patriots= In 1997, Pelini was hired by New England Patriots head coach Pete Carroll, again as defensive backs coach, helping the Patriots reach the playoffs twice during his three years there. =Green Bay Packers= In 2000, Pelini became the linebackers coach for the Green Bay Packers under head coach Mike Sherman. Green Bay posted a 33‚Äì15 record and reached the playoffs twice in Pelini's three years there as linebackers coach. =Nebraska Cornhuskers (DC/Int. HC)= Pelini returned to the college ranks in 2003 when he was hired as Defensive Coordinator for the Nebraska Cornhuskers by Head Coach Frank Solich. In 2002, the season prior to his hiring, Cornhuskers' defense was ranked 55th nationally. In his first year it improved to 11th and led the country in turnover margin. At the conclusion of the regular season, despite posting a 9‚Äì3 record, Solich was fired by new Nebraska athletic director Steve Pederson. Pelini was named the interim head coach and led the Cornhuskers to a 17‚Äì3 win over the Michigan State Spartans in the 2003 Alamo Bowl. Pelini interviewed for the Nebraska head coach position, but Pederson instead decided after a 41-day search to hire Bill Callahan, who had just been fired by the Oakland Raiders after a disappointing 4‚Äì12 season. The following year, Nebraska's defense fell to 56th nationally. =Oklahoma Sooners= For 2004, Pelini joined the Oklahoma Sooners as co- defensive coordinator under head coach Bob Stoops, helping the Sooners to a 6th place national rushing defense and 11th place national scoring defense on their way towards winning the 2004 Big 12 Championship Game and a spot in the 2005 BCS National Championship Game, where they were defeated 55‚Äì19 by the USC Trojans. =LSU Tigers (DC) ‚Äì First tenure= In 2005, Pelini was hired by LSU Tigers Head Coach Les Miles, again as defensive coordinator. His success continued, as LSU was ranked 3rd nationally in overall defense for each of his three years with the Tigers. At the conclusion of the 2007 regular season, the LSU Tigers defeated the Tennessee Volunteers 21‚Äì14 in the 2007 SEC Championship Game and went on to win 38‚Äì24 against the Ohio State Buckeyes, Pelini's alma mater, in the 2008 BCS National Championship Game. =Nebraska Cornhuskers (HC)= During the 2007 football season, Nebraska Chancellor Harvey Perlman fired athletic director Steve Pederson, and appointed former Cornhuskers head coach Tom Osborne as Interim Athletic Director. One day after the Cornhuskers' final game of the season, a 65‚Äì51 loss to the Colorado Buffaloes and finishing the season with 5 wins and 7 losses, Osborne fired Bill Callahan and announced an immediate search for a new football coach. Pelini was selected after a nine-day search as the next head coach. Two names revealed among five interviewed candidates included Buffalo head coach Turner Gill and Wake Forest Demon Deacons head coach Jim Grobe. 2008 season Nebraska opened up with 3 straight wins against Western Michigan Broncos, San Jose State Spartans, and New Mexico State Aggies. Bo Pelini's arrival saw a renewed interest and optimism in Nebraska football, as evidenced by their record Pay- Per View buys. Nebraska then proceeded to lose a close game to Virginia Tech Hokies, and then suffered the worst home loss in school history to the Missouri Tigers 52‚Äì17 the next week. The first road game of the season produced a loss to the Texas Tech Red Raiders in overtime despite giving up 8.77 yards per play. Then the Huskers traveled to Ames, Iowa and beat a 2‚Äì10 Iowa State Cyclones. They came back home and won against the Baylor Bears. Pelini's Huskers then lost on the road the following week to the Oklahoma Sooners by a tune of 62‚Äì28, where Oklahoma scored 35 straight before Nebraska answered. By halftime, the score was 49‚Äì14. This game marked the first time Pelini went up against Bob Stoops who he formerly worked under as defensive coordinator for the Sooners in 2004. This game also marks the most points ever scored against Nebraska in a single quarter. On November 8, Bo Pelini's Nebraska Cornhuskers won against the Kansas Jayhawks, making them bowl eligible. The 9‚Äì4 season was capped by a 26‚Äì21 victory over the Clemson Tigers at the 2009 Gator Bowl, played only days after Pelini returned from his father's funeral service in Ohio. Pelini's 2008 regular season record of 9‚Äì4 was the highest among all 28 Division I FBS teams with new head coaches and staffs that year. This performance was rewarded in March 2009 when his salary was increased from $1.1 to $1.8 million. Pelini's contract ran until February 2014. 2009 season Expectations were high heading into the 2009 season for the Cornhuskers. Despite having to replace record-setting quarterback Joe Ganz, and the entire receiving corps, Nebraska was expected to contend in the wide open Big 12 North Division. The Cornhuskers were ranked in the preseason at #24 by the AP, the first pre-season ranking since the 2007 season. Nebraska was expecting big seasons from running back Roy Helu and defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. Before the season even started, Pelini had to kick his second leading rusher, Quentin Castille off the team. Castille's absence led to the emergence to true freshman running back Rex Burkhead during fall camp. Pelini led his team to the 2009 Big 12 Championship Game against the #3 Texas Longhorns. Texas, led by quarterback Colt McCoy, was heavily favored over the Huskers, who were ranked number 21. Despite the loss in the game, the Big 12 Championship Game showcased the skill of Ndamukong Suh. The All-American had 4.5 sacks to go along with 12 tackles, 7 of them coming behind the line of scrimmage. With his performance Suh was invited to the 2009 Heisman Trophy ceremony, where he finished 4th. Suh flourished under coach Pelini, finishing the 2009 season with 85 tackles, 12 sacks, 24 tackles for a loss, 10 passes broken up, 3 blocked kicks, one interception, and a forced fumble. Suh won almost every major post season award available to a defensive lineman, including the Lombardi Award, Outland Trophy, Chuck Bednarik Award, Bronko Nagurski Trophy, and The Bill Willis Trophy. Suh is the second Outland and Lombardi winner of Pelini's, following Glenn Dorsey. Nebraska finished the season with a 33‚Äì0 win over the Arizona Wildcats in the 2009 Holiday Bowl where Pelini proclaimed to the Nebraska fans in the Holiday Bowl stands \\"Nebraska is back and we're here to stay!\\". The victory was the first bowl shutout of Nebraska's 45 bowl history, as well as the first shutout in Holiday Bowl history. Nebraska's final rank in the coaches and AP media poll was 14th, the highest final ranking since 2001. Under Pelini Nebraska finished #1 in NCAA scoring and pass efficiency defense, the first time since 1984 and 2003 that Nebraska has led the country in those categories respectively. 2010 season Following a mixed 2009 finish (notably the Big 12 Championship Game loss and the Holiday Bowl victory), Bo's Cornhuskers began the season ranked #8 in the pre-season AP poll. Nebraska was expected by several sports analysts to compete for the Big 12 title before departing to the Big Ten Conference in 2011. Following disappointing losses to both the Texas Longhorns and Texas A&M; Aggies, the Cornhuskers dropped to #15 in the AP poll going into the final week of the regular season therefore eliminating any realistic hopes of a national championship in 2010. Nebraska proceeded to beat the Colorado Buffaloes in the final regular game of the season, clinching the Big 12 North title. In the 2010 Big 12 Championship Game, Nebraska committed four turnovers and blew a 17‚Äì0 second quarter lead on the way to a 23‚Äì20 defeat to Big 12 South Co-Champion Oklahoma. In the final BCS ratings for the season, Nebraska finished 18th and in fifth place amongst Big 12 teams behind Oklahoma, Missouri, Oklahoma State, and Texas A&M.; Nebraska lost the 2010 Holiday Bowl, 19‚Äì7, to the Washington Huskies. Three months prior, the Cornhuskers defeated the Huskies by 35 points in Seattle. 2011 season After a disappointing end to the 2010 season, Nebraska began 2011 with wins in its first four games against Chattanooga, Fresno State, Washington, and Wyoming. Nebraska was defeated by the Wisconsin Badgers in the Cornhuskers' first Big Ten Conference game. The Cornhuskers came out strong tying it up at 14‚Äì14 with four minutes to go in the 2nd quarter, but Wisconsin's offense dominated Nebraska in the 2nd half and ending up winning the game with a score of 48‚Äì17. Nebraska rebounded by winning three games in a row, including a 21-point second half comeback ‚Äì the largest in school history ‚Äì against Ohio State and a 24‚Äì3 win versus #9 Michigan State. After that winning streak they were upset by the unranked Northwestern Wildcats where they suffered two fumbles inside the Northwestern 30 yard line. The next game for the Cornhuskers came against #12 Penn State. The week leading up to the game had much of the national focus revolving the firing of coach Joe Paterno and the sexual assault charges in the Penn State sex abuse scandal. A prayer was held before the game for both teams by Nebraska running backs coach Ron Brown. The Cornhuskers won the game 17‚Äì14. January 2, 2012, Nebraska lost the 2012 Capital One Bowl to the South Carolina Gamecocks, 13‚Äì30. 2012 season The Cornhuskers began the 2012 season ranked #17 in the AP Poll. After a loss to the UCLA Bruins, Nebraska won their remaining regular season games with the exception of a 38‚Äì63 loss to eventual Big Ten Leaders Division champion Ohio State. The Cornhuskers' 7‚Äì1 conference record earned the team their first Big Ten Legends Division title, and first appearance to the 2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game. Due to postseason ineligibility of both Ohio State and Penn State, they played the third place team in the Leaders Division, Wisconsin. The Cornhuskers never led during the game and were defeated by a score of 31‚Äì70. In their second appearance in as many seasons, the Cornhuskers played in the 2013 Capital One Bowl and lost to Southeastern Conference East Co-Champions Georgia Bulldogs, 31‚Äì45. 2013 season The Cornhuskers began the 2013 season ranked #18 in the AP Poll. After a loss to the UCLA Bruins, Nebraska lost starting quarterback Taylor Martinez, the first of many injuries during the 2013 season. Nebraska would go on to lose to the Minnesota Golden Gophers, Michigan State Spartans and Iowa Hawkeyes to finish the regular season 8‚Äì4. Nebraska went on and defeated Georgia 24‚Äì19 in the Gator Bowl, avenging last year's bowl loss to the Bulldogs. Nebraska finished the 2013 season with a 9‚Äì4 record, Pelini's sixth straight season with nine or more wins. Nebraska also finished the season ranked #25 in the final Coaches Poll, but unranked in the final AP Poll. 2014 season The Cornhuskers began the 2014 season ranked #22 in both the AP Poll and Coaches' polls. They finished tied for second in the Big Ten's West Division with a 9‚Äì3 record and ranked 25th in the nation. Firing On November 30, 2014, after the conclusion of the regular season, Pelini was fired by Nebraska Director of Athletics Shawn Eichorst, effective immediately. The University is contracted to pay Pelini $7.65 million in salary following his termination in the form of $150,000 monthly payments for the next 51 months. The total liquidation to be paid to Pelini is roughly $7.9 million. Pelini left the NU football program with a 67‚Äì27 record, winning at least 9 games in every season. Despite this record Nebraska never won a conference title under Pelini. Eichorst stated at a press conference that Pelini hadn't won \\"the games that mattered the most\\" against top-tier opponents despite having significant resources at his disposal. Barney Cotton was announced as interim head coach, and prepared the team for its bowl game. =Youngstown State= Pelini was hired by Youngstown State in December 2014 as their new head coach. The Penguins went 5‚Äì6 in 2015 but rebounded in 2016 to go 12‚Äì4, losing the FCS Championship game 28-14 to James Madison University. The next three seasons would see Pelini coach the Penguins to records of 6‚Äì5, 4‚Äì7 and 6‚Äì6. Through his final season in 2019, Pelini posted an overall record of 33‚Äì28 with one playoff appearance in 2015 during his five-year tenure at Youngstown State.https://www.ysusports.com/sports/fball/2018-19/schedule =LSU Tigers (DC) ‚Äì Second tenure= On Jan. 27, 2020, Pelini was named LSU's next defensive coordinator, replacing Dave Aranda. In his first game returning as defensive coordinator for LSU his defense gave up a one game SEC passing yard record against Miss State. However the next week against Vanerbilt, the defense only gave up a touchdown. The following week and in only his third game returning as LSU defensive coordinator his defense gave up 586 total yards and 45 points in a 45 to 41 loss to Missouri. In his first three games returning as the LSU defensive coordinator the LSU defense surrendered a school record 96 combined points. Social media Pelini is the subject of Twitter account @FauxPelini. @FauxPelini has impacted the Husker program, including the creation of a rivalry trophy. Controversies =First audiotape leak= Following a home game loss to UCLA on September 14, 2013, and shortly after responding to criticism from former Nebraska football player Tommie Frazier about the loss, a two-year-old audio tape with a profane tirade by Pelini was anonymously leaked to Deadspin. The recording was made following Nebraska's come-from-behind win against Ohio State in 2011, when it was reported that some students left when Nebraska was down 27‚Äì6 early in the 3rd quarter. The Huskers won 34‚Äì27. According to Deadspin, among the statements made on the audio recording, Pelini said: > Our crowd. What a bunch of fucking fair-weather fucking‚Äîthey can all kiss my > ass out the fucking door. 'Cause the day is fucking coming now. We'll see > what they can do when I'm fucking gone. I'm so fucking pissed off. Shortly after the tape was released, Pelini apologized: > I take full responsibility for these comments. They were spoken in a private > room following the Ohio State game. I was venting following a series of > emotional events which led to this moment. That being said, these comments > are in no way indicative of my true feelings. I love it here in Nebraska and > feel fortunate to be associated with such a great University and fan base. I > again apologize to anyone whom I have offended. Following the release of the audio tape University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln chancellor Harvey Perlman stated that the university would consider how to respond to the matter, and subsequently decided to move on from the incident. Tom Osborne, former coach and athletic director at Nebraska, then announced that he had heard the tape in 2012 (about a year earlier) and talked to Pelini about it but did not tell Perlman about it. Some observers and members of the media believed that Pelini would have a difficult time winning back fan support. Pelini believed that he had built up enough \\"points\\" for at least partial forgiveness for his statements from the fans. He said he enjoys his job at Nebraska and has had great support; in fact he turned down job offers from other schools. Sports media reactions to the audio tape have ranged from calls for Pelini to be fired to the view that what Pelini said was nothing more than what other coaches have likely said in the past. =On-field conduct= Pelini's behavior was again called into question during Nebraska's nationally televised loss to the Iowa Hawkeyes at the end of the 2013 regular season. At halftime, the coach snapped at ESPN on ABC reporter Quint Kessenich when asked about a pair of Cornhusker turnovers, responding with \\"What kind of question is that?\\" Later, in disagreement with a call made on the field, Pelini swung his hat within inches of an official's face, drawing a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. Pelini remained defiant in the post game press conference, referring to his personal foul call as \\"chicken shit\\" and declaring, \\"If they want to fire me, go ahead‚Ä¶I don't apologize for anything I have done.\\" Pelini subsequently apologized for his behavior after the Iowa game. During the November 14, 2015 game against the North Dakota State Bison in the 4th quarter, Pelini engaged the referees in several heated arguments for penalties they called including two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties on Pelini. He was reprimanded by the Missouri Valley Football Conference for his on field conduct. =Second audiotape leak= Following his firing on November 30, 2014 Pelini met with his (former) team at a local high school on December 2. Leaked audio of the meeting revealed that the coach verbally attacked University of Nebraska administration. At one point Pelini said: > It wasn't a surprise to me. It really wasn't. I didn't really have any > relationship with the AD. The guy ‚Äî you guys saw him (Sunday) ‚Äî the guy's a > total p----. I mean, he is. He's a total c---. After the leak, the Nebraska administration released a statement, saying: > If these comments were, indeed, spoken by Mr. Pelini, we are extremely > disappointed, but it only reaffirms the decision that he should no longer be > a leader of young men at Nebraska. His habitual use of inappropriate > language, and his personal and professional attacks on administrators, are > antithetical to the values of our university. His behavior is consistent > with a pattern of unprofessional, disrespectful behavior directed by Mr. > Pelini toward the passionate fans of Nebraska, employees of the university > and, most concerning, our student-athletes. This behavior is not tolerated > at the University of Nebraska and, among many other concerns, played a role > in his dismissal. Youngstown State, who had already hired Pelini stated: > \\"Coach Pelini's remarks as reported are inappropriate and unfortunate. We > have discussed the report with Coach. We are confident that Coach will > conduct himself accordingly moving forward. We will not be commenting any > further on this issue.\\" Head coaching record See also * List of college football head coaches with non-consecutive tenure References Explanatory notes Citations External links * Youngstown State profile * Nebraska profile Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:American football safeties Category:Green Bay Packers coaches Category:LSU Tigers football coaches Category:Nebraska Cornhuskers football coaches Category:New England Patriots coaches Category:Ohio State Buckeyes football players Category:Oklahoma Sooners football coaches Category:San Francisco 49ers coaches Category:Youngstown State Penguins football coaches Category:High school football coaches in Ohio Category:Sportspeople from Youngstown, Ohio Category:Players of American football from Ohio ","title":"Bo Pelini"},{"id":"7973242","text":"The American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) was founded in 1946 to facilitate the exchange of information related to problems of the hand.American Society for Surgery of the Hand. (1995). The First Fifty Years. \\"The Second World War to 1971: The Founding,\\" pp.1-17. New York: Churchill Livingstone Inc. It is the oldest and largest medical specialty society in the United States devoted to the care of the hand. Hand surgery as a specialty grew out of the treatment of the hand injuries that occurred during World War II. Sterling Bunnell, MD, founder and first president of the ASSH, set up nine regional hand centers at U.S. Army bases throughout the United States during the 1940s. As World War II drew to a close, Dr. Sterling Bunnell suggested forming an organization to continue to foster interest in hand care. In January, 1946, he and 34 hand surgeons, many of whom had worked in the Army hospitals, met immediately preceding the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS). The group continued to meet in conjunction with the AAOS Annual meeting until 1987, when it held its first stand-alone annual meeting. ASSH offers four types of membership: Active, Candidate, International, and Affiliate. Active members are physicians who reside in the United States or Canada, and are certified by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS), the American Osteopathic Board of Orthopedic Surgery (AOBOS), the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS), the American Board of Surgery (ABGS) or by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. All American-based hand surgeons seeking admission to Active Membership within ASSH are required to hold a Certificate of Added Qualifications in Hand Surgery, which is jointly administered by the three American boards. To maintain membership within ASSH, Active Members must attend an ASSH annual meeting at least once every three years. Candidate members are qualified surgeons working in the United States who are interested in hand surgery and may eventually apply for full membership. International members are qualified hand surgeons practicing medicine outside of the United States. Affiliate members are allied healthcare professionals (e.g., hand therapists; occupational therapists; physical therapists; physician assistants; nurse practitioners; registered nurses) specializing in care of the hand and upper extremity.

It went extinct when humans began to settle on the island. Its scientific name means \\"dog-beast of Sardinia\\", the genus name from the and and the specific name from the . Life restoration When the ancestor of this canid, a species of the wolf-sized Xenocyon lycaonoides, became confined to the island, its diet became limited to small and fast prey, such as rodents and rabbits. This lack of large prey caused the Sardinian dhole to evolve into a small sized (perhaps ) canid. This view of Cynotherium as a predator specializing in small, fast prey is supported by an examination of the animal's anatomy. The evolution of short, powerful limbs, a low neck carriage and increased head and neck mobility suggests an animal well suited for stalking and then quickly pouncing on or running down small prey. PDF copy Despite its common name, Cynotherium sardous is not always listed as a relative of the modern dhole. Recent studies consider the Sardinian dhole a part of the tribe Canini and a relative of the genus Lycaon, which includes the African wild dog and the extinct Lycaon sekowei. As mentioned earlier, some species of Xenocyon are thought to be the ancestor of Cynotherium. Another hypothesis posits that the Sardinian dhole is derived from a late population of Canis arnensis (or Canis mosbachensis). An origin from Xenocyon is supported by Cynotherium malaestai, a species described in 2015 from the Middle Pleistocene of Sardinia, intermediate in morphology between Xenocyon lycaonoides and Cynotherium sardous.

W. Park Seed Company, Inc., now known as Park Seed Company.  Early life  Park was born in 1853, in Libonia, Pennsylvania, one of seven children. While just a young child, he demonstrated great interest in horticulture, and his mother encouraged him to raise flowers in a corner of her garden. He successfully grew a variety of plants and learned how to harvest his own seeds. When Park was 15, he bought a hand press and printed a list of seeds that he had harvested and wanted to sell. In addition to giving the list to friends and neighbors, he also bought an advertisement in The Rural American for $3.50, that resulted in $6.50 in orders.  Career  The cover of the June 1899 Park's Floral Magazine. Image provided courtesy of the Park Seed Company archive. Park‚Äôs first catalog was published in 1868; it contained eight pages and used two illustrations, woodcuts of an aster and a pansy. In 1871, Park started a monthly magazine, The Floral Gazette, in which he offered gardening advice and created a forum where people could write in to share gardening experiences and trade seeds, bulbs and plants. Circulation of the magazine grew to 20,000 in 1877, and to over 800,000 by 1918. Although Park changed the name of the monthly magazine to Park's Floral Magazine in 1877, and raised the subscription price to 50 cents a year to cover increased postal rates, thousands of loyal readers still felt they were getting a bargain. In 1882, Park left his business to attend Michigan State University, where he graduated four years later with a degree in horticulture. Park returned to his business, which continued to grow at Libonia, Pennsylvania. By the turn of the century, the company had outgrown the second-class post office at Libonia and, in 1902, moved to La Park. Park began to travel, searching for new and better varieties of seeds and plants. From the Deep South, he acquired unusual semi-tropical plants and from the West he brought back many forms of cactus, that he propagated and offered to his customers. Park entertained his readers with accounts of his adventures across the U.S., Mexico and Europe.  Personal life  During one of his trips, he stopped to visit Mary Barratt in Greenwood, South Carolina, who had written to him for advice on teaching horticulture to housewives; the two subsequently began exchanging letters. What began as friendship based on their common interest in plants, blossomed into love and they were married in 1918. The couple and their two sons, George Barratt Park and William John Park, eventually moved to Dunedin, Florida, and printed a catalog there in 1923. The Parks liked living in Florida but discovered that their seeds would not keep fresh in the heat and humidity. They then moved to Mary‚Äôs hometown of Greenwood. = Death = Park died in 1935. Mary continued to run the company during the Great Depression and World War II, while raising their two boys.

Its central principle is that vanguardism by cadres of small, fast-moving paramilitary groups can provide a focus (in Spanish ') for popular discontent against a sitting regime and thereby lead a general rebellion. Although the original approach was to mobilize and launch attacks from rural areas, many foco ideas were adapted into urban guerrilla warfare movements by the late 1960s.  Background  Like other theorists of his era (such as Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh and Am√≠lcar Cabral), Che Guevara believed that people living in countries still ruled by colonial powers, or living in countries subject to newer forms of economic exploitation, could best defeat colonial powers by taking up arms. Guevara also believed in fostering armed resistance not by concentrating one's forces in urban centers, but rather through the accumulation of strength in mountainous and rural regions where the enemy had less presence. \\"The Legacy of Che Guevara: Internationalism Today\\" by Dr. Peter Custers, Sri Lanka Guardian, 24 February 2010.  Cuban Revolution  Foco theory, which was formally theorized by R√©gis Debray, draws on Guevara's experience of the 1959 Cuban Revolution, where a small group of 82 members landed in Cuba on board of the Granma in December 1956 and initiated a guerrilla war in the Sierra Maestra. During two years, the poorly armed escopeteros, at times fewer than 200 men, won victories against Fulgencio Batista's army and police force, which numbered between 30,000 and 40,000 in strength.\\"Bockman\\", chapter 2. The small group finally took Havana after the December 1958 Battle of Santa Clara. This surprising success led to the foco theory which inspired by Mao Zedong's doctrine of people's war counted on the support of the people to win the war. However, the foco theory stated that this popular support would be created during the armed struggle itself, therefore against the predominant Marxist theory there was no need to wait for the \\"objective conditions\\" of a popular uprising to engage the last stage of the revolutionary struggle (i.e. armed struggle). In other words, a small group of revolutionaries was considered to be enough to jumpstart a revolution since this group could begin the revolutionary struggle while at the same time developing the conditions necessary for popular support for the revolution. This theory focused heavily on the notion of vanguardism and on the moral value of the example.  Theory  While foco theory drew from previous Marxist‚ÄìLeninist ideas and the Maoist strategy of \\"protracted people's war\\", it simultaneously broke with many of the mid-Cold War era's established communist parties. Despite Nikita Khrushchev's eager support for \\"wars of national liberation\\" and the foco's own enthusiasm for Soviet Union patronage, Cuba's own Popular Socialist Party had retreated from active confrontation with the Fulgencio Batista regime and Castroism/Guevarism substituted the foco militia for the more traditional vanguard party. In Guerrilla Warfare (La Guerra de Guerrillas), Guevara did not count on a Leninist insurrection led by the proletariat as had happened during the 1917 October Revolution, but on popular uprisings which would gain strength in rural areas and would overthrow the regime. The vanguard guerrilla was supposed to bolster the population's morale, not to take control of the state apparatus itself and this overthrow would occur without any external or foreign help. According to him, guerrillas were to be supported by conventional armed forces: > It is well established that guerrilla warfare constitutes one of the phases > of war; this phase can not, on its own, lead to victory.Ernesto Che Guevara > French ed.: Oeuvres I, Petite collection Maspero, 34, 1968, p. 32. Guevara added that this theory was formulated for developing countries and that the guerrilleros had to look for support among both the workers and the peasants.Guevara, Che. \\"Guerrilla War: A Method.\\" In power, Castro sided with the Soviet Union in the 1961 Sino-Soviet split while Guevara sympathized with China. Perhaps accelerated by this divide, the latter man shifted his energies away from Cuba to adventurism, promoting guerrilla foco theory overseas. Though this method had triumphed in Cuba, Guevara saw it subsequently fail in Africa and Latin America. Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila put it in practice in Congo. Guevara's attempt to forge an insurgency in Bolivia led to his capture and subsequent execution in 1967.  After Guevara  Guevara's unsuccessful campaign in Bolivia dampened Cuba's overt support of focoist uprisings internationally for several years and many revolutionary movements split into different factions, particularly New Left, Maoist and/or urban guerrilla breakaways from previous Moscow-line parties and/or foco groups. By the mid-1970s, Cuba revived and further escalated its previous zeal, directly deploying its military in Africa before the collapse of d√©tente‚Äîe.g. supporting up the MPLA government in Angola.  Argentina's People's Revolutionary Army  In Argentina, the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), led by Roberto Santucho, attempted to create a foco in the Tucum√°n Province. The attempt failed after the government of Isabel Per√≥n signed in February 1975 the secret presidential decree 261, which ordered the army to neutralize and/or annihilate the ERP insurgency (which was not supported by a foreign power and also lacked popular support). Operativo Independencia gave power to the Argentine Armed Forces to \\"execute all military operations necessary for the effects of neutralizing or annihilating the action of subversive elements acting in the Province of Tucum√°n\\".Decree No. 261/75 . NuncaMas.org, Decretos de aniquilamiento. General Acdel Vilas immediately deployed over 3,000 soldiers, including conscripts from the Fifth Infantry Brigade and two companies of elite commandos. While fighting the guerrillas in the jungle, Vilas concentrated on uprooting the ERP support network in the towns, using state terror tactics, inspired by the 1961 Battle of Algiers, later adopted nationwide as well as a civic action campaign. The ERP was quickly defeated, but this military campaign marked the beginning of the Dirty War in Argentina.  Central America  After victories for a once-divided, recently reunited Sandinista movement in Nicaragua and the united front-style New Jewel Movement in Grenada in 1979, Castro effectively supported the creation of the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front of El Salvador by pushing for the merger of five other communist factions between December 1979 and October 1980. Similarly, Cuba supported four rival guerrilla groups' decision to form the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity coalition of Guatemala in 1982.

He was the first Italian to play in the Premier League, when he signed with Nottingham Forest in 1995. He amassed Serie A totals of 132 games and 32 goals over six seasons, with Napoli and Torino. Silenzi appeared once for the Italian national team, in 1994. Club career =Early years= Silenzi was born in Rome. Nicknamed Pennellone (Big brush) due to his height, he began his playing career with local A.S. Lodigiani. During his third season there he started scoring, and finished as second top scorer in Serie C2 with 18 goals. In the next season he moved to Serie B with A.C. Arezzo, but the campaign was a disaster both individually and collectively; the club finished last and was relegated to Serie C1, with the player appearing in 19 games and failing to find the net once. Silenzi was transferred to another third level side, A.C. Reggiana 1919, for 1988‚Äì89, where his fortunes changed dramatically. The team won promotion that year, finishing in first place, with him contributing nine goals in 31 appearances. The next season he fared even better, finishing as the league's top scorer in division two; he scored an astonishing 23 goals out of the squad's 33, doing it in 38 matches for the best goal-per-match ratio in the competition. =Napoli= Silenzi's prolific scoring garnered the attention of Scudetto and Coppa Italia winners S.S.C. Napoli, which was looking to strengthen its attacking options in a team which already featured Diego Maradona. He was ultimately acquired for 6 billion lira, and 1990‚Äì91 started brightly with the capture of the Supercoppa Italiana ‚Äì a 5‚Äì1 thrashing of Juventus FC, with him contributing with two of the five goals. However, the rest of that season proved unlucky for the player, who only managed two Serie A goals (Maradona only netted six, all on penalties); the team finished eighth but went on to rank fourth the following year, mainly thanks to the firepower of Careca and Gianfranco Zola who had taken over for the banned Maradona ‚Äì he only scored four times from 20 appearances. =Torino= The next season Silenzi, aged 26, was signed by Torino FC, brought in with some of the funds that the club made on the then world-record sale of Gianluigi Lentini to A.C. Milan. The team finished in ninth place, and he again grabbed only a handful of league goals (three). The only bright spot of the campaign was the conquest of the team's fifth Italian Cup, as he endeared himself to the fans with his display in the final, where Toro defeated A.S. Roma after two legs on the away goals rule, the aggregate score being 5‚Äì5; he scored both of the crucial goals in the second leg in Rome (5‚Äì2 loss). Silenzi had his best top-flight year in 1993‚Äì94, as he finished the season with 17 goals (tied for third in the scorers list) and also reached the semi-finals of the domestic cup. He spearheaded the attacking trio of Enzo Francescoli and a young Benito Carbone, and his impressive form garnered him a call-up to the Italian national team in early 1994; the following year saw the arrival of Ruggiero Rizzitelli, and he took over the leading goal-scoring spot from Silenzi, which translated into 15 more goals (19 to four). =Nottingham Forest= In the summer of 1995, Silenzi was signed by Nottingham Forest's manager Frank Clark for ¬£1.8m, becoming the first ever Italian to play in the Premier League. However, he never fitted into the set-up at the City Ground, playing only ten league games in the 1995‚Äì96 season; after only two appearances in the following campaign, he returned to his country and joined S.S.C. Venezia on loan. In total, Silenzi made only 20 official appearances (seven starts) for Forest, scoring twice: one in the FA Cup against Oxford United and one in the League Cup against Bradford City. It is alleged that his contract was torn up by manager Dave Bassett (who took over in March 1997), for allegedly refusing to return from his loan spell at Venezia. In the English press, he is considered as one of the worst ever signings in the country. =Late career= Silenzi continued his career with various clubs back in Italy, going on to play for Reggiana and Ravenna Calcio and also returning to Torino for a sole season, his two goals being too little to save Emiliano Mondonico's side from top-flight relegation. He retired in 2001 at the age of 35, with another return, at Ravenna, failing to find the net during 2000‚Äì01's second tier. Following his retirement, Silenzi worked for Torino as one of the club's directors. In March 2009, he was appointed as the head of the A.S. Cisco Calcio Roma youth sector. International career Silenzi's only cap for Italy came on 16 February 1994, as he played against France as part of the warm-up process for the FIFA World Cup being held that summer. In the match held in Naples (0‚Äì1 loss), he came on as a second-half substitute. Style of play Silenzi was an \\"old- fashioned\\" centre forward, who was primarily known for his strength and ability in the air, but equally for his inconsistency at the top level and his lack of notable technical ability. Personal life Silenzi was a Protestant, belonging to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. His son, Christian, was also a footballer.

St. John's is the oldest consecrated building in Cuyahoga county. This stone gothic revival church building was designed by Hezekiah Eldredge and built beginning in 1836 and was completed 1838. Eldridge was probably familiar with John Henry Hopkins' \\"An Essay on Gothic Architecture\\", the first book on Gothic ecclesiastical architecture to be published in the United States. St. John's is a good representative of a small group of American churches inspired by Hopkins' book. On November 9, 1816, a group of Episcopalians met in the log home of Phineas Shepard on the Cleveland's west side at what is now West 25th Street and Detroit Avenue, to organize what was to become Trinity Parish. The parish is the site of the original Episcopal congregation in Cleveland. In 1825, east side members moved the original parish, named Trinity from Ohio City, to a site near Public Square. West side members remained in Ohio City, naming the new parish St. John's. Trinity Cathedral is now the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Ohio. St. John's was also the mother church to several of the west side parishes. In 1837, the Ohio City Directory described the church as follows, \\"The Episcopal Church, which is not yet finished, is built of hammered stone, and has a lofty steeple. Its style of architecture is Gothic, resembling that of the ancient and venerable Cathedral. This building, when finished, will be one of the best of the kind in the western country, and may be considered as an ornament to the young city\\". The original bell (1846) now is housed in the west side of the narthex, due to weakening of the steeple. Next to the church stands the frame gothic revival Parish Hall is circa (1875). This \\"Gothicized meeting house\\" has been rebuilt twice, once after a fire in the 1880s and once after a tornado in 1953. The present plan, with neither a central aisle nor an apse, is therefore similar to the original plan. At one time the church was more elaborate than it is today; the church pinnacles no longer exist. St, John's was known as \\"Station Hope\\" on the Underground Railroad. An Episcopal parish continued to worship in this space through December, 2007; and the building remains property of the Diocese. Currently, social justice events, guest speakers and meetings also occur at the church. As of 2016, the Vicar is The Rev. Kelly Aughenbaugh. Yearly, an event called \\"Station Hope\\" occurs in spring. The following is from an advertisement for the event: \\"STATION HOPE 2017 - A Beacon Of Freedom. A Convening of Community. A CELEBRATION OF HOPE. - Join over 200 artists to engage and reflect on social justice, equity and a shared vision of hope- on the grounds of Cleveland's first authenticated Underground Railroad site, St. John's Episcopal Church in Ohio City.

The dogma was championed by the Nobel Prize Laureate Christian B. Anfinsen from his research on the folding of ribonuclease A. The postulate amounts to saying that, at the environmental conditions (temperature, solvent concentration and composition, etc.) at which folding occurs, the native structure is a unique, stable and kinetically accessible minimum of the free energy. The three conditions: *Uniqueness ‚Äì Requires that the sequence does not have any other configuration with a comparable free energy. Hence the free energy minimum must be unchallenged. *Stability ‚Äì Small changes in the surrounding environment cannot give rise to changes in the minimum configuration. This can be pictured as a free energy surface that looks more like a funnel (with the native state in the bottom of it) rather than like a soup plate (with several closely related low-energy states); the free energy surface around the native state must be rather steep and high, in order to provide stability. *Kinetical accessibility ‚Äì Means that the path in the free energy surface from the unfolded to the folded state must be reasonably smooth or, in other words, that the folding of the chain must not involve highly complex changes in the shape (like knots or other high order conformations). How the protein reaches this structure is the subject of the field of protein folding, which has a related concept called Levinthal's paradox. The Levinthal paradox states that the number of possible conformations available to a given protein is astronomically large, such that even a small protein of 100 residues would require more time than the universe has existed (1016 seconds) to explore all possible conformations and choose the appropriate one, it would also arguably make computational prediction of protein structures under the same basis unfeasible if not impossible. Also, some proteins need the assistance of another protein called a chaperone protein to fold properly. It has been suggested that this disproves Anfinsen's dogma. Many chaperones do not appear to affect the final state of the protein; they seem to work primarily by preventing aggregation of several protein molecules prior to the final folded state of the protein. However, at least some chaperones are required for the proper folding of their subject proteins. Prions are an exception to Anfinsen's dogma. Prions are stable conformations of proteins which differ from the native folding state. In bovine spongiform encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease), native proteins re-fold into a different stable conformation, which causes fatal amyloid buildup. Other amyloid diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are also exceptions to Anfinsen's dogma. References Further reading  *Profiles in Science: The Christian B.

The testing program involves horticulture professionals. Organization AAS was founded by Ray Hastings in 1932, making it the oldest international seed and plant testing organization in North America. It is governed by a Board consisting of four officers and six directors. Selection process =Submissions= Plant breeders and developers submit new plants to AAS for evaluation. The plants are then tested at more than 40 independent sites located in 24 US states and 5 Canadian provinces. A test site is called a trial garden or trial ground. Each trial ground has at least one official AAS judge. The judge supervises the trial and evaluates entries for AAS at no charge. None of the judges are paid for their AAS activities. =Judging= AAS Trials have been conducted every year since 1932. The number of judges and sites may vary. Typically, judges are horticultural professionals, and the sites, in different parts of North America, are part of a seed company trial ground, university, or other horticultural institution. All judges and trial sites are approved by the AAS Board of Directors with the objective of having well managed sites. The site judge is responsible for conducting the trial of entries and the closest comparisons on the market. The judge evaluates entries looking for desirable qualities such as novel flower forms, flower colors, flower show above foliage, fragrance, length of flowering season, and disease or pest tolerances or resistance. Vegetables are judged looking for such traits as speed to harvest, total yield, fruit taste, fruit quality, ease of harvest, plant habit, disease, and pest resistance. In the last ten years, an entry needs to have at least two significantly improved qualities to be considered by judges for an AAS Award. The judges evaluate AAS trials all season, reporting their scores each fall. The judges score each entry from 0 to 5 points, with 5 being the highest. AAS uses an independent accounting firm to calculate the average score of each entry. Only the entry with the highest average score is considered for a possible AAS Award. The AAS judges determine which, if any, new unsold entries have proven superior qualities to be introduced as AAS Winners. =Awards= In 1984 the AAS Board of Directors decided to simplify the award system and award only two types. There is an AAS Gold Medal award reserved for a breeding breakthrough. Gold Medal Awards have been rare, only given once or twice a decade. The other AAS Award recognizes a flower or vegetable for significant achievements, proven to be superior to all others on the market. Award winners in past years have included the pansy variety Viola wittrockiana ‚ÄòDwarf-Swiss Giants‚Äô, Coreopsis ‚ÄòEarly Sunrise‚Äô, ‚ÄòSugar Snap‚Äô peas, and Zinnia ‚ÄòThumbelina‚Äô. =Public relations= AAS does not advertise the AAS Award Winners. AAS relies upon a public relations program to inform gardeners about AAS Winners that are announced each September. Consumer magazines, newspapers, garden club bulletins and cooperative extension agents are depended upon to introduce AAS Winners to home gardeners.

It spanned the Los Angeles River, the Santa Ana Freeway (US 101), and the Golden State Freeway (I-5), as well as Metrolink and Union Pacific railroad tracks and several local streets. Built in 1932, the viaduct was composed of three independent structures: the reinforced concrete west segment, the central steel arch segment over the river, and the reinforced concrete east segment. In 1986, the Caltrans bridge survey found the Sixth Street Viaduct eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. Despite its historical status, the bridge was closed for demolition and replacement in January 2016 due to concerns over seismic instability. Demolition and replacement Demolition of the bridge in April 2016 First stages of falsework looking west over the LA River During the construction of the viaduct in the 1930s, an onsite plant was used to supply the concrete for construction. However, the quality of the concrete turned out to have a high alkali content and led to an alkali-silica reaction (ASR) which created cracks in the concrete and sapped the strength of the structure. It is the only one of the historic LA River bridges to suffer from ASR. Estimates stated that the viaduct had a 70% probability of collapse due to a major earthquake within 50 years. After initial demolition plans were delayed, the bridge was closed on January 27, 2016, and demolition began on February 5, 2016. It took nine months to demolish the existing bridge. Prior to the demolition, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti recorded the R&B; song \\"101SlowJam\\", backed by musicians from the city's Roosevelt High School, and issued it via a video on his own YouTube channel. The public service announcement video advertised the closure of parts of the 101 Freeway to accommodate the demolition of the viaduct. An estimated 48,000 cubic yards of concrete, 1,245 tons of structural steel and 4,200 tons of rebar were hauled away as construction began on the replacement. The new not yet completed bridge is designed by architect Michael Maltzan and the HNTB Design-Build team and contractors Skanska and Stacy and Witbeck. The new design has several green spaces built under and around it. Bridge construction has experienced several years long construction delays and multi- million dollar cost increases. The latest completion date is set for March 2022. Cultural depictions The bridge is a well-known local landmark, and has appeared in numerous films, television shows, music videos and video games since 1932. =Films= * Them!

Geography  K√∂r√∂snagyhars√°ny is a small village in B√©k√©s county, close to the Romanian border. It covers an area of 19.93 km¬≤ and has a population of 698 people (2002).  History  The name of the village is originated by scholars from the time of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin. Right before the home-taking conquest, three Kabar tribes joined the Hungarians, one of the names of those tribes was Hars√°ny. K√∂r√∂snagyhars√°ny was first mentioned at the beginning of the 14th century in book V√°radi Regestrum, in which one of the inhabitants of the village was summoned to an ordeal. In 1234 King Andr√°s the II. was granted to Mester Demeter from genus Aba nemzets√©g. The name of the settlement at that time was written as Egyh√°zashars√°n (=Hars√°n with Temple). In 1241/1242, during the Mongol invasion of Europe the village was destroyed, but soon rebuilt by its former inhabitants. For its faithful service K√∂r√∂shars√°ny was given the rank City of Hajdu by Istv√°n Bocskai. In 1660, during the Turkish conquest of Hungary, the village was completely destroyed again by Habsburgs and Ottomans. After the destruction, the village was rebuilt on the left bank of the river Sebes-K√∂r√∂s, since when the city lies at its present place. The settlement was mentioned later as Nagy- √©s Kishars√°ny (Large and Small Hars√°ny) as a land of Capital Catherdal of Nagyv√°rad (present Oradea, Romania), that was still possessed it at the first half of the 19th century. Later, at the beginning of the 20th century Mrs. Gustav Elek had bigger properties worth mentioning. Before the Treaty of Trianon, K√∂r√∂snagyhars√°ny belonged to Bihar county, district Cs√©ffa\\". After the Treaty of Trianon in 1920, K√∂r√∂snagyhars√°ny ‚Äì which originally belonged to the sphere of influence of Nagyv√°rad ‚Äì became a border settlement. After being cut from Nagyv√°rad, losing its trade and human connections with its vital city, started a process of depopulation. = The history of Jewry and their graveyard in K√∂r√∂snagyhars√°ny = For about one and a half centuries (1780s-1944), a small religious Jewish community, consisting mainly of small shopkeepers, innkeepers and tenant-farmers, lived in the settlement. In 1870 47 Jews lived here. They built houses, established a graveyard and became an integral part of the society and life of the village. After the Treaty of Trianon the Jewish community slowly started to diminish, and then their fate was sealed by the Holocaust. Four person were deported from the village: M√≥ric Gr√≥sz (1887‚Äì1944), Jol√°n Gr√≥sz (1899‚Äì1944), Olga Gr√ºnhut (1905-1944/45) and Gy√∂ngyi Gr√ºnhut (1925-1944/45). They died in concentration camps. During the time of deportation, though, members of several Jewish families from the countryside were hidden in the village. = Ethnical groups = In 1910, out of 1411 inhabitants a survey found 1336 Hungarians, and 73 Romanians. Religious spread was: 1288 Calvinist, 73 Orthodox Christians and 19 Jewish. The village is now mainly inhabited by Calvinist Hungarian families. Based on a survey made in 2001 92% of the inhabitants of the village was Hungarian, 7% Gipsy, 1% Romanian.A 2001-es n√©psz√°ml√°l√°s nemzetis√©gi adatsora References  External links  * Homepage of K√∂r√∂snagyhars√°ny * K√∂r√∂snagyhars√°ny on the site of a falvak.hu * Book about the Jewish Community of K√∂r√∂snagyhars√°ny  See also  * Jews in Bekes county Category:Populated places in B√©k√©s County Category:Shtetls Category:Holocaust locations in Hungary ","title":"K√∂r√∂snagyhars√°ny"},{"id":"7973636","text":"That Justice Be Done was a one-reel American propaganda film directed by George Stevens and made in 1945 by the Office of War Information for the US Chief of Counsel at Nuremberg and the War Crimes Office of the Judge Advocate General's Corps.

The narrator describes how the various classes of war criminals, traitors, and people who committed specific acts are dealt with, then moves on to the major Nazi war criminals. The narrator states that we cannot torture or poison them like they did to their victims, but must uphold a higher standard of justice, exemplified by George Washington. The film states that 1945 must be the year of not only Germany's military defeat but also that of a trial and therefore a public exposure and repudiation of the ideas of Nazism itself.

He rescued or recreated a high number of songs that had been almost lost, and also published several books and articles to divulge his views on flamenco and flamenco history. He considered himself as heir to the art of Manuel Torre, the most classic flamenco singer from Jerez, and also acknowledged the influence of other masters like Tom√°s Pav√≥n or Joaqu√≠n el de la Paula. Early life and career Mairena was born in Mairena del Alcor, Seville Province, Spain. He won several awards, the most important of which was the Llave de Oro del Cante (Gold Key of Flamenco Singing), which he obtained in the third Concurso de C√≥rdoba (Contest of C√≥rdoba). It is common belief that the contest was organized especially to grant him the award, and that the appearance of a contest was contrived to have a good excuse to grant him this honour, although some flamenco historians justify this on the grounds that he deserved the award for the service he had rendered to the art of flamenco (√Ålvarez Caballero 1995). He died in Seville, aged 73 or 74. His work He excelled in the most serious, solemn palos of Gypsy origin (often known as Cante Jondo), like Ton√°s, Martinetes, Sole√°, and Seguidillas, of which he recorded all or most of the traditional songs and variations. The value of his artistic legacy is controversial. On the one hand, some flamenco fans and critics consider him to be a model to imitate, an impersonation of the most authentic flamenco, and a restorer of traditional forms. On the other hand, others disregard him as excessively orthodox, academic, and cold, and regard his views on flamenco as paralysing and a threat to the future evolution of the flamenco art. They also often accused of ethnic bias, as he tended to overemphasise the quality of flamenco styles which were of gypsy origin, while looking down to anything non-gypsy. It is frequently stated that some of the songs he rescued from oblivion had in fact been created by him, although he always denied it, as he believed that in flamenco there was no scope for new creations, and modern singers had to limit their work to the traditional songs inherited from the tradition. However, many of the songs he rescued are now part of the usual repertoire of flamenco artists.

He was known as the \\"father of exercise cardiology\\" for his research and development of the Bruce Protocol. Background Bruce received a Bachelor of Science degree from Boston University and graduated from the University of Rochester School of Medicine in 1943. He joined the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Rochester in 1946. In 1950 he was named the first Chief of Cardiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine. He was director of the Division of Cardiology until 1971, and co-director with Dr. Harold T. Dodge for another ten years after that. Exercise stress testing Before the development of the Bruce Protocol there was no safe, standardized protocol that could be used to monitor cardiac function in exercising patients. Master's Two-Step Test was sometimes used, but it was too strenuous for many patients, and inadequate for the assessment of respiratory and circulatory function during varying amounts of exercise. Most physicians relied upon patients' complaints about exertion, and examined them only at rest. To address these problems, Bruce and Dr. Paul Yu began work on developing a treadmill exercise test. The test made extensive use of relatively new technological developments in electrocardiographs and motorized treadmills. A Bruce exercise test involved walking on a treadmill while the heart was monitored by an electrocardiograph with various electrodes attached to the body. Ventilation volumes and respiratory gas exchanges were also monitored, before, during and after exercise. Because the treadmill speed and inclination could be adjusted, this physical activity was tolerated by most patients. Initial experiments involved a single-stage test, in which subjects walked for 10 minutes on the treadmill at a fixed workload. Bruce's first paper on treadmill exercise tests, published in 1949, analyzed minute- by-minute changes in respiratory and circulatory function of normal adults and patients with heart or lung ailments. In 1950 Bruce joined the University of Washington, where he continued research on the single-stage test, particularly as a predictor of the success of surgery for valvular or congenital heart disease. Later he developed the multistage test, consisting of several stages of progressively greater workloads. It was this multistage test, a description of which was first published in 1963, that became known as the Bruce Protocol. In the initial paper, Bruce reported that the test could detect signs of such conditions as angina pectoris, a previous heart attack, or a ventricular aneurysm. Bruce and his colleagues also demonstrated that exercise testing was useful in screening apparently healthy people for early signs of coronary artery disease. Seattle Heart Watch Bruce and Dr. Harold T. Dodge initiated the Seattle Heart Watch program in 1971. This program involved community physicians in hospitals, offices, and the medical department of the Boeing Company. It tested the feasibility, utility and reproducibility of results of symptom-limited exercise testing in ambulatory cardiac patients and apparently healthy subjects. A database of more than 10,000 individuals was developed over the next 10 years. Signals from the treadmill monitors were sent by dataphone from 15 different test sites to the University Hospital research lab for analysis, and follow-up questionnaires from thousands of patients were accumulated for years. This database was used to develop normal standards based on age, sex and habitual pattern of activity. The duration of exercise became the principal measurement for the estimation of what Bruce termed functional aerobic impairment. The Seattle Heart Watch program demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the Bruce Protocol. It also demonstrated that it was a powerful prognostic tool. Other research Bruce developed an early interest in the use of computers in cardiology and established a computer laboratory in the Division of Cardiology. He devised a method for quantifying the QRS and ST segments in the EKG during exercise. In the late 1950s, he was also one of the first to suggest the possible benefit of thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction. Bruce published more than 300 scientific articles, a major contribution to knowledge of cardiovascular physiology in health and disease. He was a founding member of the Association of University Cardiologists and its second president, in 1969. As well as a scientific researcher, Bruce was also a clinician and a teacher. There is now a Robert A. Bruce Endowed Chair in Cardiovascular Research at the University of Washington.

The area contains two villages: Alcal√† de la Jovada and Beniaia. In the past, there were also another five villages, some of them uninhabited or in ruins; they were: Criola, Benial√≠, Benixarco, La Roca and La Adsubia/L'Atz√∫via (Benial√≠ is not to be confused by an existing village of the same name, found in the neighbouring valley of Gallinera). According to the 2005 census, Alcal√† and Beniaia's inhabitants add up to a total of 165. Until the 1950s the villages had well over 500 inhabitants (642 in 1910), but a steady decline started in the 1960s as families emigrated to the nearby large towns of Pego, Oliva, Gandia, Muro d'Alcoi, Cocentaina and Alcoi. History Font d'Al-Azraq. The village of Vall d'Alcal√† is very famous for being the birthplace of Al-Azraq, a Moorish Commander who signed an important treaty with King James I of Aragon in 1245, known as the Al-Azraq Treaty of 1245, locally known as the 'Tractat del Pouet' ('Treaty of the little well') because it was signed beside a small water source just outside the village. Al-Azraq famously betrayed the treaty in 1245 and 1258 when he unsuccessfully tried to defeat James I's army. The battles are still remembered today all around the region, when towns gather to watch Moros i Cristians or 'Moors and Christians' parades. The ones held in Alcoi are by far the most famous and spectacular, and is televised live on Canal Nou television as well as occasionally on state channel TVE. Both Alcal√† and Beniaia have their own Moors and Christians parades too, in August and September respectively, albeit on a much smaller scale. Economy Cherries, almonds and olives are the main exports from Vall d'Alcal√†. Many of the cherries bought overseas in, for example, the UK, come from the valley, which has its own Denominaci√≥n de Origen, 'Muntanya d'Alacant'.  Etymology  Alcal√† comes from the Arabic ŸÑŸÇŸÑÿπÿ© for 'The citadel', al-qal'a.  Local sights and amenities  The village of Alcal√† de la Jovada has three bars, a campsite, a hotel, a public swimming-pool, a sports complex, an Internet caf√©, a cultural centre/theatre, a chemist and a church. It however does not have a general store or shop. The ruined Moorish village of L'Atzuvieta is nearby, as are two domes which were packed with snow in the winter so as to keep food cold during the warmer months. These are called 'Neveras' (or 'Neveres' in Valencian. The upper Nevera is called 'Nevera de Dalt', the lower one 'Nevera de Baix'. 'Nevera' is the modern word for refrigerator, but the origins of the word come from nieve (neu in Valencian) meaning snow. Further down towards the neighbouring La Vall d'Ebo village, there is a cave that was discovered in 1919 by a local hunter called Jos√© Vicente Mengual, known locally as El t√≠o Rull or 'Uncle Rull'. His dog chased a rabbit down a hole and did not come back. He then sent his ferret down and that did not return either. Finally, he moved some rocks and discovered a cave containing stalactites and stalagmites. The cave, which officially bears his nickname La Cova del Rull, is open to the public. The village of La Vall d'Alcal√† celebrates its week-long festa on normally the first but sometimes the second weekend of August. Beniaia celebrates its own, smaller festa in September.

It acts as a kinase inhibitor of a number of cell receptors, mainly the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and the RET-tyrosine kinase. The drug was developed by AstraZeneca and later on Sanofi. Medical use Vandetanib is used to treat medullary thyroid cancer in adults who are ineligible for surgery. Index page at FDA website for NDA 022405 Contraindications The V804M mutation in RET confers resistance to Vandetanib anti-RET activity. In people with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, no dosage for vandetanib has been recommended, as its safety and efficacy has not been established yet. Vandetanib is contraindicated in people with congenital long QT syndrome. Adverse effects Very common (present in greater than 10% of people) adverse effects include colds, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, decreased appetite, low calcium absorption, insomnia, depressed mood, Headache, tingling sensations, weird, painful sensations, dizziness, blurred vision, damage to the cornea, long QT syndrome, high blood pressure, stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, sensitivity to sunlight, rash, acne, dry and itchy skin, nail disorders, protein in urine, kidney stones, weakness, fatigue, pain, and edema. Common (present in between 1% and 10% of people) adverse effects include pneumonia, sepsis, influenza, cystitis, sinusitis, laryngitis, folliculitis, boils, fungal infection, kidney infections, low thyroid hormone levels, low potassium, high calcium levels, hyperglycemia, dehydration, low sodium levels, anxiety, tremor, lethargy, loss of consciousness, balance disorders, changes in sense of taste, visual impairment, halo vision, perceived light flashes, glaucoma, pink eye, dry eye, keratopathy, hypertensive crisis, mini strokes, nose bleeds, coughing up blood, defecating blood, colitis, dry mouth, stomatitis, constipation, gastritis, gallstones, Chemotherapy-induced acral erythema, hair loss, painful urination, bloody urine, kidney failure, frequent urination, urgent need to urinate, and fever. Interactions Vandetanib has been reported as a substrate for the OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters. Interaction of vandetanib with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may alter its hepatic disposition and can lead to transporter mediated drug-drug interactions. Also, vandetanib is an inhibitor of OATP1B3 transporter but not for OATP1B1. Other drugs that prolong the QT interval can possibly add to this side effect of vandetanib. As the drug is partly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, strong inducers of this enzyme can decrease its blood plasma concentrations. CYP3A4 inhibitors do not significantly increase vandetanib concentrations, presumably because it is also metabolised by flavin containing monooxygenase 1 (FMO1) and 3. Pharmacology Vandetanib is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and RET tyrosine kinases. RET tyrosine kinases; it weakly inhibits VEGFR-3. Metabolites of vandetanib (top left): N-desmethylvandetanib (bottom left, via CYP3A4), vandetanib-N- oxide (bottom right, via FMO1 and FMO3), both pharmacologically active, and a minor amount of a glucuronide. Vandetanib is well absorbed from the gut, reaches peak blood plasma concentrations 4 to 10 hours after application, and has a half-life of 19 days on average, per pharmacokinetic studies. It has to be taken for about three months to achieve a steady-state concentration. In the blood, it is almost completely (90‚Äì96%) bound to plasma proteins such as albumin. It is metabolised to N-desmethylvandetanib via CYP3A4 and to vandetanib-N-oxide via FMO1 and 3. Both of these are active metabolites. Vandetanib is excreted via the faeces (44%) and the urine (25%) in form of the unchanged drug and the metabolites. History Vandetanib was approved by the FDA in April 2011 for treatment of late-stage thyroid cancer. Vandetanib was first initially marketed without a trade name; it has been marketed under the trade name Caprelsa since August 2011. In 2015 Genzyme acquired the product from AstraZeneca. Research AstraZeneca tested Vandetanib in clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer and submitted an application for approval to the EMA but then withdrew the application in October 2009 after trials showed no benefit when the drug was administered alongside chemotherapy. A clinical trial of vandetanib plus gemcitabine versus placebo plus gemcitabine in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic carcinoma was negative in a prospective, randomised, double-blind, multicentre phase 2 trial.

The organization publishes the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, a peer-reviewed science journal.  History  The AAPA was first formed following a proposal by Czech-American anthropologist Ale≈° Hrdliƒçka at the December 1928 New York meeting of Section H (Anthropology) of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Twenty anthropologists and anatomists voted in favor of the creation of an American Association of Physical Anthropologists, and an organizational committee of eight was formed (Fay Cooper Cole, Charles H. Danforth, GeorgeA. Dorsey, William K. Gregory, Earnest A. Hooton, Ale≈° Hrdliƒçka, and Robert J. Terry). The first annual meeting of the AAPA was held in 1930 at the University of Virginia. = Name Change = In 2018, at the 87th meeting of the AAPA in Austin, Texas, the Executive Committee stated its intention to hold a survey of AAPA members to assess their opinions on whether the AAPA should change its name, and what potential names could replace it. There were several motivations for the survey, including the fact that most academic departments, courses, and textbooks today use the term biological anthropology rather than physical anthropology, which evokes antiquated focuses of the discipline, such as racial typology. Moreover, most members of the AAPA self-identify as biological anthropologists, rather than physical anthropologists. The survey was administered online to AAPA members, and a majority voted in favor of changing the name, with the most popular name choice being American Association of Biological Anthropologists. A formal vote among Regular members with take place at the 2019 meeting, with a final vote at the 2020 meeting.  Membership  There are over 2,200 members of the AAPA. There are three categories of membership: Regular, Student, and Special (persons with a professional interest in biological anthropology who do not meet the requirements of regular membership). Members of the AAPA can attend the annual meeting at a rate determined by their membership category, receive full access to AAPA publications and electronic communications, and submit nominations for elected positions. Regular members may vote and serve in elected positions.  Annual Meeting  The AAPA holds an annual meeting that is attended by scientists from around the world. The 2019 meeting will be held in Cleveland, Ohio.  Position Statements  = Statements on Race & Racism = A 2019 statement on race and racism by the AAPA declares, in part: > Race does not provide an accurate representation of human biological > variation. It was never accurate in the past, and it remains inaccurate when > referencing contemporary human populations. Humans are not divided > biologically into distinct continental types or racial genetic clusters. > Instead, the Western concept of race must be understood as a classification > system that emerged from, and in support of, European colonialism, > oppression, and discrimination. This statement further emphasized that \\"No group of people is, or ever has been, biologically homogeneous or 'pure.' Furthermore, human populations are not ‚Äî and never have been ‚Äî biologically discrete, truly isolated, or fixed.\\" Previously, the AAPA had published an official position on biological aspects of race, based on evidence from anthropological (as well as biological, genetic, and social scientific) research in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, vol. 101, pp 569‚Äì570, 1996. That statement emphasized that all humans belong to a single species and share common descent, that biological traits are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and genetic diversity exists within all human populations. This position was first drafted as a revision of the 1964 UNESCO statement on race, which itself was first created in 1950 in response to World War II and Nazism. = Scientific Creationism and the National Center for Science Education (NCSE) = As written in 1982, in agreement with the AAAS, the AAPA condemns the teaching of scientific creationism at public expense. = AAPA Code of Ethics = The AAPA has an official code of ethics emphasizing the importance of the well-being of the people and animals with which members work; informed consent; conservation of fossil, archaeological, and historical records; making data accessible and disseminating findings; teaching in a non-discriminatory fashion, and giving appropriate credit to all collaborators including students and trainees. The AAPA also an official statement on sexual harassment, outlining the definition, prevention, and reporting of sexual harassment and assault within the professional community as well as expectations for behavior among members.

His memoir of the search for his father, The Return, won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and the 2017 PEN America Jean Stein Book Award. His debut novel In the Country of Men was shortlisted for the 2006 Man Booker Prize. Matar's essays have appeared in the Asharq al-Awsat, The Independent, The Guardian, The Times and The New York Times. His second novel, Anatomy of a Disappearance, was published to wide acclaim on 3 March 2011. He lives and writes in London. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and Associate Professor of Professional Practice in Comparative Literature, Asia & Middle East Cultures, and English at Barnard College, Columbia University. Early life Hisham Matar was born in New York City, in 1970, the second of two sons. His father, Jaballa Matar, who was considered a political dissident for his opinions on Colonel Muammar Qaddafi's coup in 1969, had to move the family away from Tripoli and was working for the Libyan delegation to the United Nations, in New York, at the time of Matar's birth. The family moved back to Tripoli, Libya, in 1973, but fled the country again in 1979. Matar was nine when they moved to Cairo, where the family lived in exile, and where Matar's father became more vocal against the Gaddafi regime. Matar continued his schooling at Cairo's American school. In 1982, Matar's brother Ziad left for boarding school in the Swiss Alps. Though Matar desperately wanted to join his brother, he had to wait four more years until he too was sixteen. Because of the continued threats by the Libyan dictatorship against their father (as well as a threat to Ziad's safety while he was studying in Switzerland), however, he could not follow his brother to Switzerland. Both boys had to attend the schools under a false identity. Matar chose a school in England and enrolled in 1986. > \\"I was to pretend that my mother was Egyptian and my father American. It was > thought that this would explain, to any Arabs in the school, why my Arabic > was Egyptian and why my English was American. My first name was Bob.

If someone called Hisham, I was not to turn.\\" ‚Äî Hisham Matar, 2011. By the time Matar finished his studies, Ziad was a university student in London. Matar decided to pursue his studies in architecture, and later received an MA in Design Futures at Goldsmiths, University of London. In 1990, while he was still studying in London, his father Jaballa Matar, was abducted in Cairo. He has been reported missing ever since. In 1996, the family received two letters in his father's handwriting stating that he had been kidnapped by the Egyptian secret police, handed over to the Libyan regime, and imprisoned in the notorious Abu Salim prison in the heart of Tripoli. The letters were the last sign and only thing they had heard from him or about his whereabouts. In 2010, Matar reported that he had received news that his father had been seen alive in 2002, indicating that Jaballa had survived a 1996 massacre of 1200 political prisoners by the Libyan authorities.\\"Hisham Matar has just learnt that his father, who disappeared 20 years ago, might be alive\\", The Guardian, 16 January 2010. > \\"In March 1990, Egyptian secret service agents abducted my father from his > home in Cairo.

Matar's writing often borrows from and refers to painting, architecture, and music. Though he has said he cannot remember a time when he wasn't writing, Matar first turned to his interests in music‚Äî\\"And because I had no talent in music,\\" he's said, \\"I became an architect, and I continued writing.

It is located in Deoghar in the Santhal Parganas division of the state of Jharkhand, India. It is a temple complex consisting of the main temple of Baba Baidyanath, where the Jyotirlinga is installed, and 21 other temples. According to Hindu beliefs, the demon king Ravana worshipped Shiva at the current site of the temple to get the boons that he later used to wreak havoc in the world. Ravana offered his ten heads one after another to Shiva as a sacrifice. Pleased with this, Shiva descended to cure Ravana who was injured. As he acted as a doctor, he is referred to as Vaidhya (\\"doctor\\"). From this aspect of Shiva, the temple derives its name. Kanwar Yatra (Devanagari: ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ç‡§µ‡§°‡§º ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ) is an annual pilgrimage of devotees of Shiva, known as KƒÅnvarias(‡§ï‡§æ‡§µ‡§°‡§º‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ) or \\"Bhole\\" (‡§≠‡•ã‡§≤‡•á) to Hindu pilgrimage places of Sultanganj in Bihar to fetch holy waters of Ganges River.

Location of Baidyanath Jyotirlinga Baidyanatham Chithabhoomau (1/21-24)http://imgur.com/DPV9XwK and Sivmahapuran Satarudra Samhita (42/1-4)http://imgur.com/FW7VC6M is the ancient verse that identifies location of Vaidyanth Jyotirlinga. According to which Baidyantham is in 'Chidabhoomi', which is the ancient name of Deoghar. In Dwadasa jyothirlinga sthothram, Adi Sankaracharya has praised Vaidyanath jyothirlinga in following verses, > Poorvothare prajwalika nidhane > sada vasantham girija sametham > surasuraradhitha padapadmam > srivaidyanatham thamaham namami This states that Vaidyanath jyotirlinga is located at Prajwalika nidhanam (meaning funeral place i.e., chithabhoomi) in the North-Eastern part of the country. Deoghar is far located in east compared to Parli which is in west- central part of the country. Also Chidabhoomi indicates that, in olden days, this was a funeral place, where corpses are burnt and post-death ceremonies were performed. This place could have been a center of tantric cults like Kapalika/Bhairava where Lord Shiva is worshipped significantly as smasan vasin (meaning, residing in crematorium), sava bhasma bhushita (meaning, smearing body with ashes of burnt bodies). While, the Dvadasalinga Smaranam has variation by which, verse is Paralyam Vaidyanatham, i.e., Vaidyanatham is in Parli, Maharashtra. The names and the locations of the 12 Jyotirlingas mentioned are:http://www.shreehindutemple.net/hinduism/12-jyotirlingas-of- lord-shiv/ > Saurashtre Somanathamcha Srisaile Mallikarjunam > Ujjayinya Mahakalam Omkaramamaleswaram  > Paralyam Vaidyanathancha Dakinyam Bheema Shankaram  > Setu Bandhethu Ramesam, Nagesam Darukavane > Varanasyantu Vishwesam Tryambakam Gautameethate > Himalayetu Kedaaram, Ghrishnesamcha shivaalaye > Etani jyotirlingani, Saayam Praatah Patennarah > Sapta Janma Kritam pApam, Smaranena Vinashyati Thus the three temples claiming their shrines as 'real' jyotirlinga of Vaidyanath are *Baidyanath temple at Deoghar, Jharkhand, *Vaidyanath temple at Parli, Maharashtra and *Baijnath temple at Baijnath, Himachal Pradesh. Bhavishyapurana also describes Baidyanath as follows: \\"Narikhande is district abounding in thickets. It lies west of the Dwarikashwari River. It extends along the Panchakuta hills on its west, and approaches Kikta on the north. The forests are very extensive, chiefly of Sakhota, Arjuna and Sal trees with a plentiful addition of brushwood. The district is celebrated for the shrine of Baidyanath. The deity is worshiped by people from all quarters, and is the source of every good in the present age.\\" It is believed that, Shiva first manifested himself as a Jyotirlinga on the night of the Aridra Nakshatra, thus the special reverence for the Jyotirlinga. The same shrine of Vaidyanath is considered as one of 51 Shakti Peethas, where 'heart' of Sati (goddess) fell, after being broken apart by the Sudarshana Chakra of Lord Vishnu, from the body of Dakshayani (Sati), carried by the lovelorn, distraught Shiva, at the location on which the respective temple is built. Since the heart of Sati fell here, the place is also called as Hardapeetha. Here Sati is worshipped as Jayaa Durga (Victorious Durga) and Lord Bhairava as Vaidyanath or Baidyanath. Dakshayani was reborn as Parvati, daughter of Himaavat, king of the mountains, and his wife, the Devi Mena.51 Shaktipeethas http://www.taramaa.net/shaktipeethas.htm 51 Shaktipeethas-History http://kumbhujjain.in/blog/temple/shakti-peeths/ Jyotirlinga An 1870 watercolour showing worship of the Jyotirlinga in Deoghar. As per Shiv Mahapuran, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of preservation) had an argument in terms of supremacy of creation.R. 2003, pp. 92-95 To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either direction. Brahma lied that he found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as the second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped till the end of eternity. The jyotirlinga is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. The jyothirlinga shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light.Eck 1999, p. 107See: Gwynne 2008, Section on Char Dham Originally there were believed to be 64 jyothirlingas while 12 of them are considered to be very auspicious and holy. Each of the twelve jyothirlinga sites take the name of the presiding deity - each considered different manifestation of Shiva.Lochtefeld 2002, pp. 324-325 At all these sites, the primary image is lingam representing the beginningless and endless Stambha pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva.Harding 1998, pp. 158-158Vivekananda Vol. 4 The twelve jyothirlinga are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Uttarakhand, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga at Parli, Maharashtra, Baidyanath at Deoghar in Jharkhand, Nageswar at Dwarka in Gujarat, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Ghushmeshwar at Maharashtra.Chaturvedi 2006, pp. 58-72 Description of Temple The Maa Parvathi temple is tied up with the main temple, with huge red sacred threads which is unique and worthy of reverence, showing the unity of Shiva and Shakti. According to the stories narrated in the Shiva Purana, the holy Baidyanath temple resembles the unity of souls and thus fits marriage for Hindus. The nearest railway station is Jasidih railway station, which is 7 km from Vaidyanath temple. Jasidh is 311 km from Howrah/Sealdah on Patna route. On a normal day, the worshipping of Baidyanath Jyotirlingam begins at 4 AM. The temple doors open at this time. During 4:00am to 5:30 am, the Head priest worships with Shodashopachar. Locals also call it Sarkari Pooja. Then the devotees begin their worship of the Shivalinga. The most interesting tradition is that priests of the temple pour kuchcha Jal upon the lingam first, and later on, the pilgrims pour water and offer flowers and Bilva leaf, upon the lingam. The Puja rituals continue till 3.30 PM. After this, the temple doors are closed. In the evening at 6 PM the doors are opened again for devotees/ pilgrims and the process of worshipping begins again. At this time Shringar Puja takes place. The temple closes at 9:00 pm on a normal day, but during Holy Shravan month, the timings are extended. Unlike Somnath or Rameshwaram or Srisailam, here the devotees can get satisfaction by offering Abhishek themselves on Jyotirlinga. The pandas who perform different poojans for devotees are very important persons. The devotee can also buy Peda as prasad from Babadham. Peda is a local speciality of Deoghar. Babadham has a regular and well-maintained office to accept offerings and donations. The Matsyapuran narrates the place as Arogya Baidyanathitee, the holy place where Shakti lives and assists Shiva in freeing people from incurable diseases. This whole area of Deoghar was under the rule of the Kings of Gidhaur who were much attached with this temple. Raja Bir Vikram Singh founded this princely state in 1266. In 1757 after the Battle of Plassey the officers of the East India Company paid their attention to this temple. An English man, Keating was sent to look at the administration of the temple. Mr. Keating, the first English collector of Birbhum, took interest in the administration of the temple. In 1788, under Mr. Keating's order Mr. Hesilrigg, his assistant, who was probably the first English man to visit the holy city, set out to supervise personally the collection of the pilgrim offerings and dues. Later, when Mr. Keating himself visited Babadham, he was convinced and forced to abandon his policy of direct interference. He handed over the full control of the temple to the hands of the high priest.http://www.liveindia.com/jyotirlinga/baidyanath.html Shravan Mela and yatra  Millions of pilgrims visit this shrine every year. It is famous for the mela of Shraavana (a month of the Hindu calendar), between July and August. About 8 to 10 million devotees visit the place from various parts of India and offer holy water of Ganges to the deity collected from Sultanganj, which is almost 108 km from Deoghar and Baidyanath. The water is also brought by the KƒÅnvarias, who carry the water in Kavadi, and walk all the distance, on barefoot. You will find large crowds walking all the way carrying water. An unbroken line of people in saffron-dyed clothes stretches over the full 108 km for the month. The pilgrims are called Dak Bam and they do not stop even once in their journey from Sultangunj, located at Bhagalpur district to Vaidyanath. Pilgrims to the temple later visit the Basukinath temple.

A young nobleman, Abe no Yasuna (ÂÆâÂÄç ‰øùÂêç), is on his way to visit a shrine in Shinoda, in Settsu Province, when he encounters a young military commissioner who is hunting foxes in order to obtain their livers for use as medicine. Yasuna battles the hunter, sustaining several wounds, and sets free the white fox he had trapped. Later, a beautiful woman named Kuzunoha helps Yasuna to return to his home. She is the fox he saved, adopting human form in order to tend to his wounds. He falls in love with her and they marry. She bears him a child, Seimei (childhood name D≈çji), who proves prodigiously clever. Kuzunoha realizes that her son has inherited part of her supernatural power. Several years later, while Kuzunoha is viewing some chrysanthemums, her son catches sight of the tip of her tail. Her true nature revealed, Kuzunoha prepares to return to her life in the wild. She leaves behind a farewell poem, asking her husband Yasuna to come to see her in Shinoda Forest. Yasuna and his son search for Kuzunoha, and eventually she appears to them as a fox.

History The village was established by the Lees (Êùé) in 1660, who were originally from Dongguan, in Guangdong Province. Before they came to the village, they went to Kowloon City during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279) with the Ng (Âê≥) and Chan (Èô≥) clans and set up the Nga Tsin Wai Tsuen. The villagers were farmers, producing rice, sugar and beancurd sticks, which they sold in the Sai Kung Market. In the 1950s, iron mines were opened in Ma On Shan. As a consequence, the water tables of the village were lowered and the land became unsuitable for cultivation, forcing many farmers to abandon their land. Twelve families also surnamed Lee were resettled by the government from Ping Chau to a site near the village with the provision of water supply for their daily use and irrigation.Brief Information on No Grade Items, pp.542-543 The village today The village is abandoned but is regularly visited by its ancestral descendants at times of ancestral worship such as at Qingming Festival.

History Blood Compact Shrine in Bohol where the blood compact was done.Inscription on a plaque on the Blood Compact Marker at the Blood Compact Shrine, Bool District, Tagbilaran City In 1521, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan became the first person from Europe to reach Asia by sailing west, a voyage of which he would meet an untimely death in the island of the Philippines. Spain sent expeditions to colonize the East Indies in their competition with Portugal to seize control over the spice trade. However, all of these expeditions failed. It was not until Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi, sailing from Mexico with five ships and five hundred men, reached the Philippines in 1565 and a Spanish settlement was established.Readings From Bohol's History www.aenet.org, Source: Philippine Political and Cultural History. Volume I. Gregorio F. Zaide Retrieved 15 November 2006. L√≥pez de Legazpi was greeted by hostile Muslim tribes opposing a foreign invasion. His attempt to land on the island of Cebu resulted in the death of one of his soldiers prompting him to explore another island and seek trade with various tribes. Sailing south toward the island of Mindanao, L√≥pez de Legazpi's fleet encountered highwinds forcing them to sail northward to the island of Bohol. There, he captured a vessel from Borneo whose Malay sailors informed the Spaniards that the natives inhabiting the region traded with people from Borneo and Indonesia. Arriving in Bohol, L√≥pez de Legazpi noticed the hostility of the people. The Malayan servant explained that such hostility was due to the expeditions conducted by the Portuguese from the Moluccas islands. In 1563, Portuguese fleets arrived in Visayan waters and enslaved about 1,000 inhabitants. L√≥pez de Legazpi, with the help of the Malayan sailor, explained to the tribes in Bohol that they were not Portuguese and that they had come to the islands to trade. Upon learning this, the chieftains and their tribes became friendlier and welcoming to the Spaniards. Ceremony The Sandugo began with the arrival of Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi in Bohol in 1565 and the establishment of allegiance by Datu Sikatuna to the king of Spain. They made a cut on their left arm with a dagger and poured their blood into a cup filled with wine, which they both drank in honour of their friendship.Sandugo Festival Bohol www.philippinecountry.com Retrieved November 16, 2006. The inscription at a monument in Tagbilaran City describes the event: It added that the compact was performed as part of the tribal tradition. In his report to Philip II, L√≥pez de Legazpi wrote: Tradition Sandugo reenactment By performing a blood compact, it preserves the bond of friendship between two tribes. This ceremony was the first treaty or bond of friendship between the natives, and the Spaniards. In honor of this ceremony, the former President of the Philippines Elpidio Quirino established the Order of Sikatuna, a presidential decoration conferred upon politicians. Juan Luna, a Filipino painter, depicted this event in his painting entitled The Blood Compact (Spanish: El Pacto de Sangre) in 1883.

Paul Strudel or Paul Strudl (c. 1648 ‚Äì 20 November 1708) was an Austrian sculptor, architect, engineer, and painter, ennobled as Baron von Strudel and Vochburg. \\"Landesmuseum Nieder√∂sterreich - Geschichte/Personen - Paul Strudel\\" (history), Landesmuseum Nieder√∂sterreich (lower Austria), 2006, Geschichte.Landesmuseum.net: LMN-PaulStrudel. As a sculptor in the Hofburg, Paul Strudel worked creating statues with his younger brother, Peter Strudel.  Life  In 1648, Paul Strudel was born, as would be his younger brothers, Peter and Dominik, in Cles in the Val di Non in the County of Tyrol, where his father Jakob worked as a sculptor. Paul learned with his father and with Johann Carl Loth in Venice. In 1684, he came to Vienna, where he made three statues for the Prince of Liechtenstein; his high remuneration caused the envy of his German colleagues at that time. The Plague Column Paul Strudel came in 1686 to the Hofburg court in Vienna and obtained employment as a Court painter. Translated from German Wikipedia article: :de:Paul Strudel. Mostly he co-operated with his brother Peter Strudel. His work marks the transition of Austria to the high baroque; however, Strudel captured the style of Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The most important works of Paul Strudel are the large statues from white marble for the ancestor gallery of the Habsburgs. In 1696, he received the statuary order from Emperor Leopold I, on the condition to deliver, every three years, two figures. Up to his death, he had delivered 16 figures: the remaining 15 (of the total 31) statues were created by his younger brother. Strudel was responsible for overseeing the design and construction of Vienna's Plague Column from 1686 until its completion in 1693. He was also commissioned by the prince of Liechtenstein, Prince-Bishop Karl Eusebius von Liechtenstein, to create some monumental statues for his Moravian palaces in Valtice and Lednice. Due to changing tastes in art during the early eighteenth century, it was not possible for the Hofburg Court Architect Giovanni Pietro Tencalla (:de:Giovanni Pietro Tencalla) to introduce Paul Strudel (or his brother Peter) as his successor. The German building master Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt from Genoa was preferred over the Strudel brothers. At the age of approximately 60 years, Paul Strudel died on 20 November 1708 in Vienna.

Born in Islington, Barker was educated at the local elementary school system and graduated from Whitelands College (Chelsea). As a schoolteacher specializing with delinquent and other troubled children, Barker was appointed principal of the London County Council's Women's Institute correctional facility in 1913. After serving for two years, Barker resigned from her post to join Britain's war effort during World War I, teaching army cooks and as lady superintendent of the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, overseeing its 30,000 female workers. Following the war, Barker joined the Ministry of Labour's training department and, in 1923, was appointed governor of the Borstal Institution for Girls at Aylesbury. Under her administration, Barker made sweeping reforms under a model humane reformatory focusing on education, guidance and rehabilitation. By the time of her appointment of assistant commissioner of prisons in 1935, Barker would work to reform women's prisons throughout England, Wales and Scotland based on her work at Aylesbury until her death in 1955.

Functional movements are highly dependent on this part of the body, and lack of core muscular development can result in a predisposition to injury. The major muscles of the core reside in the area of the belly and the mid and lower back (not the shoulders), and peripherally include the hips, the shoulders and the neck.  Muscles  Major muscles included are the pelvic floor muscles, transversus abdominis, multifidus, internal and external obliques, rectus abdominis, erector spinae (sacrospinalis) especially the longissimus thoracis, and the diaphragm. The lumbar muscles, quadratus Lumborum (deep portion), deep rotators, as well as cervical muscles, rectus capitus anterior and lateralis, longus coli may also be considered members of the core group. Minor core muscles include the latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus, and trapezius.  Functions of the core  The core is used to stabilize the thorax and the pelvis during dynamic movement and it also provides internal pressure to expel substances (vomit, feces, carbon-laden air, etc.). *Continence Continence is the ability to withhold bowel movements, and urinary stress incontinence (the lack of bladder control due to pelvic floor dysfunction) can result from weak core musculature. *Pregnancy Women use their core muscles, specifically the transversus abdominis, during labor and delivery. *Valsalva maneuver Core muscles are also involved in the Valsalva maneuver, where the thorax tightens while the breath is held to assist, often involuntarily, in activities such as lifting, pushing, excretion and birthing. = Anatomical posture and support = The core is traditionally assumed to originate most full-body functional movement, including most sports. In addition, the core determines to a large part a person's posture. In all, the human anatomy is built to take force upon the bones and direct autonomic force, through various joints, in the desired direction. The core muscles align the spine, ribs, and pelvis of a person to resist a specific force, whether static or dynamic.  Static core function  Static core functionality is the ability of one's core to align the skeleton to resist a force that does not change. Medicine Ball Plank = Example of static core function = From Army FM 3-22.9 page 4-16An example of static core function is firing a rifle in the prone position. To maintain accuracy, the shooter must be able to transfer his or her own body weight and the weight of the rifle into the earth. Any attempt of the shooter to create a dynamic motion of the sights (muscle the sights onto the target vs. allowing the posture to aim) will result in a jerky posture where the sights do not sit still on the target. For the shooter to maintain accuracy, the muscles cannot exert force on the rifle, and the skeleton must be aligned to set the rifle (and therefore the sights) onto the target. The core, while resting on the ground and relatively far away from the rifle, is nevertheless aligning the spine and pelvis to which the shoulder and arms and neck are connected. For these peripheral elements to remain static, and not move unnecessarily, the spine, pelvis, and rib cage must be aligned towards this end. Thus the core muscles provide support of the axial skeleton (skull, spine, and tailbone) in an alignment where the upper body can provide a steady, solid base for the rifle to remain motionless. * Resistance: Gravity * Plane of movement: Coronal (side to side), Sagittal (forward and behind the anatomical position). The main anatomical planes of the human body, including median (red), parasagittal (yellow), frontal or coronal plane (blue) and transverse or axial plane (green).  Dynamic core function  The nature of dynamic movement must take into account our skeletal structure (as a lever) in addition to the force of external resistance, and consequently incorporates a vastly different complex of muscles and joints versus a static position. Because of this functional design, during dynamic movement there is more dependence on core musculature than just skeletal rigidity as in a static situation. This is because the purpose of movement is not to resist a static, unchanging resistance, but to resist a force that changes its plane of motion. By incorporating movement, the bones of the body must absorb the resistance in a fluid manner, and thus tendons, ligaments, muscles, and innervation take on different responsibilities. These responsibilities include postural reactions to changes in speed (quickness of a contraction), motion (reaction time of a contraction) and power (amount of resistance resisted in a period of time). = Example of dynamic core function = An example of this is walking on a slope. The body must resist gravity while moving in a direction, and balancing itself on uneven ground. This forces the body to align the bones in a way that balances the body while at the same time achieving momentum through pushing against the ground in the opposite direction of the desired movement. Initially, it may seem that the legs are the prime movers of this action, but without balance, the legs will only cause the person to fall over. Therefore, the prime mover of walking is achieving core stability, and then the legs move this stable core by using the leg muscles.

Nana's career as a human rights advocate spanned numerous African countries, including Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa, in addition to his native Cameroon. Was the Chief Executive Officer of Partners for Rights and Development (Paridev) a boutique consulting firm on human rights, development and health in Africa at the time of his death. Prior to that position, he was the founding Executive Director of the African Men for Sexual Health and Rights (AMSHeR)an African thought and led coalition of LGBT/MSM organizations working to address the vulnerability of MSM to HIV, Mr Nana worked in various national and international organizations, including the Africa Research and Policy Associate at the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission(IGLHRC), as a Fellow at Behind the Mask, a Johannesburg-based non- profit media organisation publishing a news website concerning gay and lesbian affairs in Africa, he wrote on numerous topics in the area of African LGBT and HIV/AIDS issues and was a frequent media commentator. Nana on died on October 15, 2015 after a brief illness. The 'Yaound√© Eleven' Following a raid on a bar in Yaound√©, the capital of Cameroon, in 2005, eleven men were arrested and imprisoned on charges of suspected homosexuality. Nana was particularly engaged in this issue, dedicating much of his work to publicising the plight of the arrested men. Partially as a result of his efforts, on October 10, 2006, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention declared that the detention of the 11 Cameroonian men on the basis of their presumed sexual orientation constituted an arbitrary deprivation of liberty contrary to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Career with African LGBT organisations Nana's career as an LGBT human rights advocate began when he worked with a Cameroonian gay association called AGALES from 1999 until 2001. He later spent time in Nigeria, where he founded an African LGBT advocacy web site, returning to his native Cameroon in part to organise communication and assistance for the imprisoned men. In the spring of 2005, he co-founded, together with two gay activist colleagues, Alternatives-Cameroun, a Cameroon-based human rights organisation working to address homophobia and end discrimination and abuse against lesbians, gay men, bisexual, and transgender individuals. Colonialism and an African voice Although much of his career was spent in West Africa, Nana's concerns extended to the whole continent of Africa. \\"As Africans, we feel the vestiges of the long European colonial presence in our continent,\\" he said. \\"We feel them when other -- Western, European, 'international' -- LGBT organisations speak on our behalf and we are left unheard. Only Africans can speak for Africans.\\" Nana also bristled at the oft-cited notion that homosexuality is a foreign, colonial import alien to Africa. He asserted that \\"neither homosexuality nor homophobia are alien to Africa,\\" as often claimed by anti-LGBTI people and LGBTI activists alike. \\"While it is important to acknowledge that some of the laws criminalizing same-sex sex in Africa are part of the framework inherited from our past, we should not negate the agency of Africans. This agency is also expressed through love, hate and most importantly through the law\\" said Nana. \\"We might not agree with our political leaders and their methods, but one thing we should not lose sight of - and learn from - is the fact that whatever powers influence politics in the corridors, these political leaders (legitimate or not) get to make the final decisions in the legislative process. In so doing they take responsibility and should be held accountable for these decisions.\\" Nana was a frequent media commentator on LGBT and HIV/AIDS matters, appearing on media outlets ranging from Radio France Internationale (RFI) to Chicago Public Radio. Fighting HIV/AIDS His work in the field of HIV and AIDS paralleled his LGBT human rights endeavours. In Cameroon, he was active in various HIV prevention efforts targeting gay and bisexual men‚Äîa high-risk group roundly ignored in official Cameroon government HIV prevention campaigns. Focusing on World AIDS Day‚ÄîDecember 1 -- Nana coordinated a letter-writing campaign to the health ministries and national AIDS committees of all African countries, encouraging them not to ignore gay and bisexual men in their work.

It was bought out by Rohto Pharmaceutical Co., a Japanese health care company, in 1988. The Mentholatum Company is known for its top three products, Mentholatum Ointment, Mentholatum Deep Heating Rub (branded as \\"Deep Heat\\" outside of the United States), and Mentholatum Lip Care. The Mentholatum Building in Buffalo, New York was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. History =Beginning (1889-1935)= The beginning of The Mentholatum Company started when Albert Alexander Hyde left the real estate market in 1889. With the collapse of the market, Hyde established a new partnership called The Yucca Company, located in Wichita, Kansas, which focused on manufacturing and marketing shaving creams, laundry soap, and toilet soap. The Yucca Company was the beginning of The Mentholatum Company. An old bottle of AA Hyde Mentholatum Ointment When The Yucca Company started manufacturing a cough syrup containing a blend of camphor and menthol, named Vest Pocket Cough Specific, Hyde became intrigued by the soothing and antiinflammatory effects of menthol. After 4 years of research and experimentation, the company introduced the original \\"Mentholatum Ointment\\" in December 1894, which consisted of a combination of menthol and petrolatum. The product was so successful that in 1903 Hyde opened a second office in Buffalo, New York, to handle sales and distribution east of the Mississippi River. In 1906, The Yucca Co. officially incorporated the name \\"The Mentholatum Company\\" after its flagship product and no longer sold soap. In 1909 a new factory was built in Wichita, Kansas, and in 1919 a second factory was built in Buffalo. The Wichita factory was closed after Hyde's death in 1935 and the corporate offices were moved to Wilmington, Delaware, in 1937 and later to Buffalo in 1945. =Japanese expansion and acquisition (1913-1988)= The products of the company spread to Japan through the missionary work of the American, William Merrell Vories. When Vories acquired the rights to sell Mentholatum products in 1920, he began importing and selling the product in Japan under the name, \\"Mentholatum\\" which in turn, was marketed through a company called The Omi Sales Company. Business continued to thrive in Japan even after Vories died in 1964. In 1974, the giant Japanese pharmaceutical company based in Osaka known as Rohto Pharmaceutical Co. set its eyes on The Mentholatum Company. In August 1975, it acquired the trademark rights to Mentholatum and began to sell the Mentholatum Ointment and Mentholatum Medicated Lip Stick, which proved to be a financial success as the company's revenue skyrocketed to ¬•2.64 billion [how much in US$/GB¬£ ??] by April 1981. Rohto Pharmaceutical Co. continued to acquire the management rights to The Mentholatum Company in June 1988, thus completing the merge. =International expansion (1988-1999)= In October 1991, The Mentholatum Zhongshan Pharmaceuticals was founded in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, China, as a joint venture company as well as the headquarters for Chinese expansion. In May 1996, Mentholatum's eye drops began local production and sales in China. P.T. Rhoto Laboratories, Indonesia and a new Tokyo Branch Office was also established in September and December 1996, respectively. In 1998, Mentholatum moved its headquarters to Sterling Drive in Orchard Park, New York.Springville Journal Staff. January 30, 2015 The Mentholatum Company thanks WNY residents for success In the mid-1999, the company released a new eye product called Zi, which is designed to cool and refresh the eyes with natural camphor and pH-balanced purified water solution. Later that year, Zi for Eyes was named \\"Best New Eyecare Product\\" in the 1999 Superdrug Health & Beauty Awards. The company continued to manufacture new products, such as Migraine Ice (chill pads for migraine sufferers), Softlips Lip Protectant, Deep Heating Rub, Natural Ice Medicated Lip Balm, Pain Patch, Fisherman's Friend cough drops, Fletcher's Castoria, Red Cross Toothache Remedy, Red Cross Canker Sore Medication, and of course, its original Mentholatum Ointment. By the end of 1999, Mentholatum alone had roughly more than $150 million worth of annual sales. =Mentholatum in the 21st century= As of 2005, the company sells its products in more than 130 countries. Mentholatum acquired the Oxy Skin Care branding (but not all the product formulas) from GlaxoSmithKline in December 2005, and targeted the younger, teen audience with new diversified offerings, packaging, and scents. The company further acquired the Phisoderm brand from Chattem Inc. for $9.6 million on November 30, 2005. In September 2014, the company celebrated its 125th anniversary. =The Mentholatum Company Buildings= The Mentholatum Company Building, also known as the Garrett Leather Building, is a historic factory building located in Buffalo, Erie County, New York. The original section was built in 1919, and is a four-story, reinforced concrete daylight factory building. It has a rectangular plan and is eight bays wide by five bays deep and has a flat roof. A one-story garage / loading dock addition was constructed in 1947 and expanded in 1966. The Mentholatum Company operated out of the building until 1997. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The building has been redeveloped as an apartment building known as The Mentholatum.

A similar program, also hosted by Herb Shriner, was Herb Shriner Time, which was aired by ABC as part of its 1951-52 lineup. The first Herb Shriner Show was essentially a continuation of what Shriner had previously done on radio. It was aired by CBS five nights a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) from 7:55 to 8:00 P.M. Eastern time and consisted solely of Shriner's folksy monologues, which had already earned him comparisons to Will Rogers. This program was seen only from November 1949 until February 1950. Herb Shriner Time was a half-hour format aired by ABC on Thursday nights at 9 PM Eastern from October 1951 to April 1952. In addition to the comedy monologues, this format provided time for guest stars, and also allowed for Shriner to play his harmonica and act in comedy sketches. In the fall of 1952, he became emcee of Two For The Money, Goodson-Todman's answer to Groucho Marx's You Bet Your Life, in which Herb delivered a brief monologue (and occasionally performed a harmonica solo) at the start of the show, then informally interviewed his contestants before a question and answer quiz segment. As a result of the show, Herb's popularity soared during this period, and when Two For the Money ended in the summer of 1956, Herb signed with CBS for another attempt at a variety series. The final (aka \\"The [New] Herb Shriner Show\\" [N.B., \\"New\\" was announced, but not written in the title]) was a predecessor of the current \\"late night\\" monologue + guest TV shows. It was sponsored by Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the makers of Geritol, and, as Shriner said on the air during episode #2 (? possibly contributing to the show's early demise ? [see below]): \\"...you know, I've been taking Geritol myself, folks, and I'll tell you one thing: It does put iron in your blood. In fact, I got my blood so full of iron now, I cut myself -- I didn't bleed, I just rusted\\". Like its previous format on ABC, it had a half-hour time slot, and was aired by CBS on Tuesdays at 9 PM Eastern from October to December 1956. As can be deduced from its short run, it was a near-complete failure in the Nielsen ratings, even though it boasted such guest talent as Jackie Gleason in its first episode, Orson Welles in its second and Burl Ives in its third. The sponsor, itself dissatisfied with the program's ratings, replaced Herb with To Tell The Truth near the end of December. Shriner was never offered the opportunity to host another regular network series; his later television career overall was considerably less successful than that which he had enjoyed in radio and Two For the Money. However, his sons Wil Shriner and Kin Shriner both had considerably more success on television in the 1980s, Wil as a comic and talk show host, Kin as a soap opera actor noted primarily for portraying Scotty Baldwin on ABC's long-running General Hospital.

Tabatabainejad allegedly refused to show his school ID to a fellow student acting as security at the college library Instructional Computing Commons (CLICC) lab at Powell Library during finals week. A UCLA ID card with magnetic strip is needed to enter into the Library after hours and therefore it was assumed that all individuals in the library were students and had valid ID cards to gain access. Asking students to show ID was not a common practice and for this reason the student refused to show his ID and instead asked the community officer if he had asked anyone else that evening to show their ID. The community officer threatened to call campus police if he didn't show ID. Tabatabainejad, being confident the campus police would take his side as he felt he was being harassed and singled out because of his Middle Eastern ethnicity, invited the community officer to do so. When the campus police arrived they did not ask questions but instead handcuffed Tabatabainejad and attempted to physically remove him from the Library. Tabatabainejad sat on the floor in protest of the way he was being treated at his own University while he was studying for final exams. The campus police then Tasered him five times while his hands were bound behind his back with plastic wrist restraints. Part of the incident was recorded on video by a camera phone and is available for viewing on YouTube.

Tabatabainejad filed a federal lawsuit alleging that the officers used excessive force and that they violated the Americans with Disabilities Act. The case was settled on May 15, 2009, with UCLA agreeing to pay $220,000. Incident At approximately 11:30 p.m. on November 14, 2006, Community Service Officers were conducting routine checks of students' BruinCard IDs in Powell Library. UCPD Assistant Chief of Police Jeff Young said the checks are a standard procedure in the 24-hour library after 11:00 p.m., when use of the library is restricted to staff, faculty and students.Sara Taylor (November 16, 2006) \\"Community responds to Taser use in Powell\\", Daily Bruin.

When Tabatabainejad failed to leave, UCPD officers were called to the scene, arriving approximately 10 minutes later. Following a confrontation, the officers used the Taser repeatedly, then told him to stand up. Tabatabainejad was released from custody after being given a citation for obstruction/delay of a peace officer in the performance of duty. According to a press release issued by the UCPD, he was also issued a court date.\\"Re: Powell Library Incident\\", memo released by the UCLA Police Department. =Officers= Terrence Duren, a former Marine and 18-year veteran of the UCLA Police Department, tasered Tabatabainejad multiple times.

In May 1990, Duren was accused of using his nightstick to choke Kente S. Scott, who was idling in front of a fraternity late on a Saturday night. Scott sued, and the university moved to have Duren removed from the force but later gave him a 90-day suspension. Duren stated that all of the past allegations against him regarding police misconduct and use of excessive force were investigated by the UCPD and proven false.Sara Taylor (November 21, 2006) \\"Officer named in Taser incident\\", Daily Bruin. (The homeless man was convicted of assaulting an officer.) Prior to the UCLA Taser Incident, several grassroots campaigns between 2002-2006 were undertaken by UCLA students to educate the student body in regard to Duren's history of excessive force. The campaigns were initiated by distinct parties in response to Duren's aggressive behavior for pedestrian citations. Prior to joining the UCPD in the late 1980s, Duren was fired from the Long Beach Police Department due to \\"poor report-writing skills and geographical knowledge.\\" Following the Tasering incident, Duren remained on active duty. Duren was named 2001 UCLA Officer of the Year by the University of California Police Department.Officer of the Year 2001, UCPD, UCLA, 2001 Also on the scene were Officers Alexis Bicomong, Kevin Kilgore, and Andrew Ikeda. =Video and eyewitness accounts= Part of the event is recorded in a six-minute cell phone video recorded by another student. The video has been widely disseminated online, and an edited version is available on the Daily Bruin site. Tabatabainejad is first heard (though not seen) repeatedly shouting \\"Don't touch me!\\" to the officers. Over the course of the video, he is stunned multiple times, while officers repeatedly order him to stand up and stop fighting, and threaten to administer further stuns. Tabatabainejad repeatedly states that he is not fighting and that he will leave the premises. He shouts that he has a medical condition,Lisa Connolly, Derek Lipkin and Saba Riazat (November 15, 2006) \\"Student shot with Taser by UCPD officers\\" i, Daily Bruin and shouts \\"Here's your PATRIOT Act!

[He was] getting shocked and Tasered as he was handcuffed.\\" Bystanders can be heard demanding the officers' names and badge numbers, and shouting for them to stop using the Taser on Tabatabainejad; numerous times these officers responded to demands of their badge numbers with phrases such as \\"do you want to get tased too?\\" At one point, the officers told the crowd to stand back and threatened to tase anyone who approached too closely. A female student said that the officers threatened to tase her when she asked an officer for his name and badge number. According to an ACLU attorney, such a threat of force in response to a badge number request constitutes illegal assault. At 6:36 in the video, an officer tells a male student, \\"Get back over there or you're going to get tased, too.\\" A press release issued by the UCPD claims that the officers \\"asked Tabatabainejad to leave the premises multiple times\\", and that Tabatabainejad refused to leave. Witnesses dispute this account, saying that Tabatabainejad had begun to walk toward the door with his backpack when an officer approached him and grabbed his arm, whereupon Tabatabainejad told the officer several times to let go.Amanda Covarrubias; Stuart Silverstein (November 16, 2006) \\"A third incident, a new video\\" Los Angeles Times.

In a statement released November 15, 2006, the day after the incident, Acting Chancellor Norman Abrams said: On November 17, 2006, a press conference was held by Abrams and UCPD Chief Karl Ross, during which it was announced that the UCPD was planning to conduct an independent investigation into the incident led by Merrick Bobb, president of the Police Assessment Resource Center.\\"Powell Incident Investigation\\" UCLA, November 17, 2006.

Storyline The Lost Christmas Eve is the final installment In TSO's Christmas trilogy. \\"The record continues the tradition of its two predecessors by telling a musical tale of loss and redemption, this one encompassing a rundown hotel, an old toy store, a blues bar, a gothic cathedral and their respective inhabitants, whose destines are intertwined by a single enchanted evening in New York City.SeaofTranquilaty.org Dec, 25, 2005. The story starts with a teardrop of infinite sorrow falling from the heavens towards a business man who forty years prior had abandoned his newborn son to a state run institution, and how there is something about Christmas Eve that allows humans to correct mistakes we have made in our lives. In this symphonic tale, God's youngest angel is once again sent on a mission to bring his Lord the name of the person who best continued his Son's work on Earth. However, unlike his other journeys, the angel could only use his wings twice, once when he descended to Earth and once more when he left. Looking for a likely place to search, the angel decided to land in New York City. As soon as he touched the ground, he notices a street performer weaving a story about the Imperial Wizards Ball of Winter to a group of children. He then entered a hotel, and as he enters the ballroom, he encounters inhabitants from the future and the past. Then he leaves and walks into a blues club, where a jazz band is playing music, eventually the whole bar gets together and starts singing along with the band, except for one man who leaves without a word refusing to be involved in this yule tide cheer. The angel noticed that the man left a trail of blood. The blood came from a wound in the man's soul combined with unwept tears that only an angel could see. As he followed the man, who had been the walking home from work, the angel peered into the man's heart to find the reason behind the man's wounded soul. As the angel delved into the man's past, he saw that he had not always hated Christmas and in fact loved it like any other child. His family was a good Christian one, and he had been taught that all men are created in God's image. He eventually got married, and his wife became pregnant. On the night of the birth, things were going as planned and normal. However, the man then noticed that there were many doctors rushing to his wife's room, but there were none leaving. The doctor told him that during the birth, she had hemorrhaged and that, unfortunately, they were unable to save her. When a nurse, in an effort to console him, gave him his son who had survived, the infant appeared sickly. The doctor explained that because the mother had hemorrhaged blood so badly, the baby had been cut from oxygen for so long that he suffered permanent brain damage; he would be unable to function as a normal person in adulthood and would be lucky if he learned to walk. Enraged by this outcome, the man screams towards heaven, that if man is made in God's image that he saw nothing of God in his son. The man gave the baby back to the nurse and asked if the child could be placed into a state facility. After seeing this, the angel let go of the man, who did not notice the angel peering into him. He later encountered a young girl, dressed in a Russian Imperial style winter coat, in front of a toy store. The girl claimed to be staying with her parents on a twelfth floor room of the hotel across the street. She asked him if he had any children. The man responded with a short and gruff \\"No,\\" but he knew that he lied, and for the first time in decades he thinks about him and the son. The man told the girl to go back to her room in a nearby hotel, where she claimed she was staying on the twelfth floor room twenty four, then called a cab and set off to find his son. Eventually, he arrived at a hospital, similar to the one where his son was born, and asked about his son. A nurse took him to a room where the son, now a grown man, was rocking babies born to crack cocaine addicted mothers to sleep. When the man asked if his son could talk, the nurse, realizing that it had been a while since they had met, said, \\"No, but he's a good listener.\\" After so many years, father and son are reunited. The father asked his son to move out of the complex he lived in to stay with him, to which he agreed. They then took a cab to the hotel near the toy store to find the girl and asked for the girl's room. However, strangely enough, there was no twelfth floor to the hotel, nor had there even been any children there the entire week. Confused, the man returned to the cab with his son. The man then took out his briefcase and spilled its contents out on the sidewalk including a folder containing his son's possessions including a picture of his wife as a little girl that he had never seen before. The son gave a puzzled look, to which the man explained that he was going to quit his job to get a job at the hospital where his son worked. The son gleefully smiled. When the angel returned to Heaven, to report to his Lord the angel at first gave the name of the man's son, but then after a moment of hesitation added the name of the story teller, the jazz player, and all of the other people he had seen, even the father. It was at this point that the angel realized that everyone continues the work of his Son when they, \\"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.\\"Lost Christmas Eve liner notes summary Track listing References to other media *\\"Back to a Reason (Part II)\\" is a sequel to the Savatage song \\"Back to a Reason\\", on their 2001 release Poets and Madmen. *\\"Queen of the Winter Night\\" is a re- working of the Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart opera The Magic Flute (specifically, the Der H√∂lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen aria). *\\"Wish Liszt\\" is a re- working of \\"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\\" by Franz Liszt. *\\"Christmas Canon Rock\\" is a re-working of \\"Christmas Canon\\" (originally found on The Christmas Attic), which is in turn a re-working of Pachelbel's Canon in D.

He was responsible for the initial design and construction of the fort, and he commanded it from 1820 through 1827. He had a reputation for being tough and fair-minded, but also had a mean temper when he was drunk. His second wife, Abigail Hunt Snelling, extended hospitality to visitors to the fort. She also founded a Sunday School for the fort's children and assisted families from the Red River Colony (the Selkirk Settlement). Lieutenant Colonel Henry Leavenworth was originally chosen to locate the fortification at the mouth of the St. Peter's River (the prior name of the Minnesota River) in 1819. His expedition started out in Green Bay, Wisconsin in May 1819, ascending the Fox River, then portaging to the Wisconsin River and following it downstream to its confluence with the Mississippi River at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. He remained at Fort Crawford with his soldiers until supplies arrived in August, 1819, and then the expedition traveled upriver to the confluence with the St. Peter's River. His soldiers originally built a winter settlement, known as Cantonment New Hope, two miles (3 km) up the St. Peter's River from the confluence. The next spring, in anticipation of flooding, he moved the troops to higher ground at a site known as Camp Coldwater, a mile up the Mississippi from the confluence of the rivers. Leavenworth was later relieved of his duty in August 1820 and succeeded by Colonel Josiah Snelling. Two Minnesota streets, one in Minneapolis (Snelling Street), the other in Saint Paul (Snelling Avenue), in Minnesota's capital city, are named after him. Life and career Snelling, born in 1782, was the son of a prominent Boston banker. He married Eizabeth Bell and fathered a son, William Joseph Snelling, in 1804; his wife died in 1810. He joined the army in May 1808, and was recognized for his performance at the Battle of Tippecanoe. He was assigned to command Fort Harrison during the winter of 1811-12.* on the Wabash River at the present site of Terre Haute, Indiana. During the War of 1812, he was promoted to Major and sent to Fort Detroit, where he met and married Abigail Hunt. They had 5 children, Mary, Henry Hunt Snelling, James, Marion and Josiah. After the size of the army was reduced in 1815, Snelling spent about four years on the northern border of New York. In June 1819, Snelling was promoted to Colonel of the 5th Infantry Regiment and sent to oversee the construction of Fort St. Anthony. Snelling was concerned about the unhealthy living conditions of the temporary quarters at Cantonment New Hope on the St. Peter's River. He traveled upriver from St. Louis and arrived at the cantonment on September 5, 1820, and immediately started the relocation and design of the new fort. Colonel Snelling located the fort on a bluff above the river junction, and with the aid of Lieutenant Robert McCabe, designed the fort as an elongated diamond. The western point of the diamond had a large round tower, about thirty feet high and thirty feet in diameter, with musket ports in the sides and a cannon on the top. The eastern point of the diamond was designed with a half-moon battery. Two smaller batteries on the north and south sides were built for infantry and cannon. Eight interior buildings of the fort were built from locally-quarried limestone, while two other buildings were built from white pine, cut from around the Rum River area. The fort had no formal architect. All of the manpower of designing and building the fort came from Snelling's own troops. The heavy limestone walls of the fort were constructed on a scale beyond many other frontier fortifications, suggesting America's intentions toward westward expansion. Major General Brown had the opinion that a frontier fort of this nature should be built for permanency and independence, since the distance from any other military posts would make assistance difficult to obtain if any battles would break out. On the other hand, the idea of a large, permanent fortress to rule over the entire territory may have been overkill, since the usual pattern of westward expansion was to build temporary fortresses ahead of the line of settlement, shifting soldiers along the way. The Army, recognizing the importance of fresh fruit and vegetables in a soldier's diet, made post commanders responsible for establishing gardens. Colonel Snelling started cultivation in 1820, planting corn and potatoes in about of river bottomland. Over the next few years, construction of the fort and cultivation of the gardens took priority over military duties. Snelling recognized that the fort should strive toward self-sufficiency, especially since the government stopped paying for seed in 1821 and since the government often delivered spoiled food or starving cattle. By 1823, nearly were being cultivated, about half of which were used for growing wheat. Snelling established a grist mill at Saint Anthony Falls to grind the wheat into flour, using millstones from St. Louis. About 100 barrels of flour were produced in 1823. In order to deal peacefully with the Indians, Snelling partnered with Indian Agent Lawrence Taliaferro. Taliaferro built a council house west of the fort in 1823, where he carefully distributed government food and supplies and provided other services to the Indians. Taliaferro's cooperation with the Indians ensured good relations and helped to avert open hostilities between the Ojibwe and the Sioux. Colonel Snelling's health began to decline in early 1826, and the prescribed treatment of opium and brandy accelerated his alcoholism. He left the fort in October 1827 and died in Washington, D.C. the following summer. Papers Papers of Josiah Snelling are available for research use. They include photocopied letters written by Josiah Snelling, military commissions and related documents from his service in the Massachusetts militia (1803-1808) and the United States infantry (1808-1820), documents relating to the Connecticut state militia during the Revolutionary War, and a journal kept by Colonel Snelling as commandant at Fort Snelling References * * Reichardt, Mary R.

The Zincke reaction The Zincke reaction should not be confused with the Zincke-Suhl reaction or the Zincke nitration. Furthermore, the Zincke reaction has nothing to do with the chemical element zinc. Reaction mechanism The first reaction is the formation of the N-2,4-dinitrophenyl-pyridinium salt (2). This salt is typically isolated and purified by recrystallization. The formation of the DNP-pyridinium salt Upon heating a primary amine with the N-2,4-dinitrophenyl- pyridinium salt (2), the addition of the amine leads to the opening of the pyridinium ring. A second addition of amine leads to the displacement of 2,4-dinitroaniline (5) and formation of the K√∂nig salt (6a and 6b). The trans-cis-trans isomer of the K√∂nig salt (6a) can react by either sigmatropic rearrangement or nucleophilic addition of a zwitterionic intermediate to give cyclized intermediate (7).

Initially both groups conceded that they had ignored existing literature on Zincke but held on to the annulene structure based on their electrospray ionization (ESI) results which according to them clearly showed dimer. In his letter Christl remarked that in ESI measurements association of molecules is a common phenomenon. In addition, he noted similarities in melting point and NMR spectroscopy. As of December 2007 the Japanese group retracted its paper in Organic Letters due to uncertainties regarding what products are formed in the reaction described and the US group added a correction to theirs in the Angewandte Chemie stating they wish(ed) to alter the proposed structure of (the) annulene.Corrigendum [12]Annulene Gemini Surfactants: Structure and Self-Assembly Lei Shi, Dan Lundberg, Djamaladdin G.

The line was later merged with the Glasgow and South Western Railway, and is today part of the Ayrshire Coast Line. History Ardrossan Railway systemIn the first years of the nineteenth century, the 12th Earl of Eglinton developed Ardrossan Harbour, intending it as a sea port for the City of Glasgow. The extensive works he had carried out cost over ¬£100,000. At that time the River Clyde was not navigable to large vessels, and he proposed a canal to reach Ardrossan. In 1806 he obtained Parliamentary authority to construct the Glasgow, Paisley and Ardrossan Canal. The authorised share capital was ¬£140,000, but subscriptions disappointed him, amounting to only ¬£44,342. Work proceeded from the Glasgow end, but the canal only reached Johnstone, all of the available money having been expended and debts of ¬£71,209 incurred. The truncated canal traded for some years, but in the 1820s the idea was proposed to build a railway to close the gap. An Act for the Ardrossan and Johnstone Railway was obtained on 14 June 1827, the estimate for the work being ¬£94,093; the debt of the canal enterprise was not assumed by the new railway company. Once again subscriptions fell short of the desired value: they amounted to only ¬£28,950, but work started, from the Ardrossan end, and once again the money was entirely expended, this time with debts of ¬£20,000, after only part of the scheme was built. It reached only from Ardrossan to Kilwinning, but with a long eastward branch in an arc to the north of the grounds of Eglinton Castle that served collieries‚Äîmost of them part of Eglinton's estate. By now the Clyde had been deepened and sea-going vessels could reach Glasgow. In comparison, even had the railway been completed, cargoes via Ardrossan would have required transshipment twice (from ship to railway and from railway to canal), and it was clear that shipping owners would find that unattractive. It is likely that the emphasis had shifted from making the Glasgow connection. The line opened in 1831; it was horse-operated and the track gauge (later sometimes referred to as the Scotch gauge).David Ross, The Glasgow and South Western Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2104, For passenger services, a carriage held 24 passengers; 16 inside and 8 outside.C J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722 - 1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, Lewin, pages 17 - 18 The rail was of the fish-bellied type, weighing , supported at a pitch of on small freestone blocks. The principal goods traffic was coal from the collieries served; Whishaw says that \\"The amount of coals from the Eglinton coal-field is stated to be about per annum ; and the average number of passengers, for the three years ending September 1839, about 31,000 annually. There are about 440 wagons in use on this line, which belong to the coal-proprietors.\\" That is, the line provided the track for hauliers to use, for a toll. He goes on, \\"The carriages hitherto used on this line were drawn by horses; each carriage holding twenty- four passengers, viz. sixteen inside and eight outside ... The outside seats are on the same level as those within; the one being in front, the other behind. ... Previously to November 1838, the passenger's fare was set at the rate of one penny per mile; but was raised in consequence of the Government duty to 8d. per six miles, or 1.333d. per mile.\\" About a hundred passengers a day is a remarkable number for a line with a limited network.Whishaw In 1839 the railway was upgraded to standard gauge with heavier rails, and gradients on the main line improved. =Route= The main line of the railway followed the route towards Johnstone shown in John Thomson's Atlas of Scotland. From Ardrossan, the proposed line goes east through Saltcoats then to the south of Stevenston before turning north between Dubbs and Todhills to pass to the west of Kilwinning,John Thomson's Atlas of Scotland, 1832, Imprint: Edinburgh : J. Thomson & Co., 1828, Part of Ayrshire (top left Section) where the railway terminated. The Doura mineral railway branch to collieries ran east from a junction north of Dubbs (Dubbs Junction) to a bridge across the River Garnock (at Dirrans), then turned northeast to serve a broad arc of collieries to the north of the grounds of Eglinton Castle. After passing Eglinton Colliery and Corsehill Head, the track turned east to a bridge over Lugton Water before a branch line north to the Fergushill colliery. The mineral railway continued southeast past Benslie pit then ended turning north to coal pits at Doura. The mineral line was later extended south to coal and fireclay workings at Perceton.Ordnance Survey, Six-inch 1st edition, Ayrshire, Sheet XVI and Sheet XVII, Survey date: 1856. The railway provided a route to the huge Eglinton Tournament of 1839. One spectator described a crowded paddle steamer from Liverpool which landed at Ardrossan pier: \\"Disembarking, we seized upon a sort of carriage which plied upon a coal train and carried a large assortment of passengers, all drawn by one horse, and set out for the little town of Irvine.\\" When the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway was opened in 1840, the Ardrossan railway now became a branch line joining this new railway at Kilwinning, and the new line south from Kilwinning to Irvine crossed over the Doura branch line a short distance to the west of the Garnock bridge. =Locomotive operation= In 1840 the line was regauged to standard gauge and connected with the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway at Kilwinning station. The permanent way was largely relaid with heavier equipment to accommodate locomotive operation, and the line was doubled. In 1854 both lines merged with the new Glasgow and South Western Railway.  Connections to other lines  * Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway at Kilwinning  Current operations  The majority of this line is still in use as part of the Largs branch, carrying passenger services marketed as the Ayrshire Coast Line. The Doura branch from Dubbs closed, and the short section at Ardrossan which later served Ardrossan Winton Pier railway station was shortened to Ardrossan Harbour railway station).

It was designed by Morris Fuller Benton and released in 1908 by his employer American Type Founders (ATF). News Gothic is similar in proportion and structure to Franklin Gothic, also designed by Benton, but lighter. News Gothic, like other Benton sans serif typefaces, follows the grotesque model, resembling serif text faces of the period, with a double-storey lower-case a and g. Also distinctive are the blunt terminus at the apex of the lowercase t, and the location of the tail of the uppercase Q completely outside the bowl. The letter forms are compact, and descenders are shallow. The typeface differs from other grotesque sans-serifs in its rather light weight and open letterforms, contributing to a less severe, humanist tone of voice. For much of the twentieth century News Gothic was used in newspaper and magazine publishing with copies available on Monotype and Intertype machines for hot metal typesetting. Both companies added additional weights to the family. For use in headlines, it was designed with condensed and extra-condensed styles. 'Gothic' was an early twentieth century term for sans-serifs, found mostly in the United States and Canada. It was also used in the UK, along with 'grotesque'. In Germany the term 'Grotesk' was used. Metal type release A post-war guide (presumably c. 1958) explaining the names used by ATF for their many somewhat related 'gothic' types and highlighting their then-new News Gothic Bold. Benton's autobiographical notes list the following designs as his contributions to the family: *News Gothic *News Gothic Condensed *News Gothic Extra Condensed ATF's 1923 specimen book also shows: *News Gothic Extra Condensed Title (a headline face) As with Franklin Gothic, the foundry expanded the line sometime later, adding two more variants: *News Gothic Bold (1958) designed by John L. ‚ÄúBud‚Äù Renshaw; Intertype had already released a bold News Gothic in a hot metal typesetting version, however, as later did Monotype. *News Gothic Condensed Bold (1965) designed by Frank Bartuska; versions also by Monotype and Intertype Both Monotype and Intertype released oblique versions; McGrew reports that while ATF's archives contained 1912 production drawings for an oblique \\"we have no record of its production\\". =Cold type copies= Virtually all producers of cold type offered their own versions of News Gothic under different names:Lawson, Provan, and Romano, \\"Primer Metal Typeface Identification,\\" pp. 34 - 35. *News Gothic ‚Äî Alphatype, Autologic, Berthold, Compugraphic, Dymo, Harris, MGD Graphic Systems, Monotype, Varityper *Gothstar Trade ‚Äî Star/Photon *Toledo ‚Äî Graphic Systems Inc. Digital releases Several common News Gothic digitisations. Because there is no active descendant of the American Type Founders Corporation making digital typefaces, News Gothic has been revived in digital form in many different versions from different sources. Benton Sans is a greatly expanded font family based on News Gothic by Font Bureau, adding additional features such as wide styles and extra-bold weights. At 80 styles, it is one of the most comprehensive digital renditions of the News Gothic style. Its users include Newsweek, Fortune magazine, the Boston Globe and Sotheby's. Digital releases actually named News Gothic have a variety of features, often adding in weights not present in the original design or removing some less popular ones. For example, Bitstream's release is rare in including the extra- condensed styles. URW++'s (also sold by Fontsite) is only sold in one width but in a wide range of weights and with italics for every weight, while Linotype's lacks a light weight or any condensed styles. Monotype's revival, a subset of which is included with many Microsoft products, features the condensed style but not extra-condensed, and has wider spacing than several others. Adobe, Monotype, Linotype and Bitstream have their own versions. The Bitstream version of News Gothic was extended with Cyrillic glyphs in 2005 and Greek glyphs in 2009 by Dmitry Kirsanov for ParaType, and is sold by them separately. Hamburg Serial is a lesser-known version of News Gothic by SoftMaker, with italics that have a one-story 'a' and 'g'. News Gothic No. 2 is an enhanced version of News Gothic produced by the D. Stempel AG type foundry in 1984. It adds more weights to the News Gothic family than were available in other versions. Adobe Source Sans Pro is a single-width design based on News Gothic, but differs in having true italics and a larger x-height for use with onscreen display. It was released in 2012 as Adobe's first open- source family under the SIL Open Font License; Adobe's training material highlights it as having a more consistent colour on the page than the rather condensed News Gothic. News Cycle is an open-source variant by Nathan Willis based on 1908 specimens of News Gothic typeface from ATF extended with full Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic glyphs. It is an open source typeface licensed under the SIL Open Font License. Similar designs Linotype called their similar design Trade Gothic while the Ludlow version was known as Record Gothic. Intertype copied the face under the same name and added a variant, News Gothic Bold (1955). Baltimore Type's copy was called Balto Gothic, while their copy of Inland Type Foundry's Inland Gothic No. 6 was perversely sold under the name News Gothic. In 1916, Sol Hess made alternate rounded characters for News Gothic Extra Condensed and the resulting face was sold by Lanston Monotype as Jefferson Gothic, which was also sold by Baltimore Type as Tourist Extra Condensed In 1935, M.F. Benton did much the same thing for A.T.F. and the face was called Phenix. Ludlow's Record Gothic began as a mere knock-off but, between 1956 and 1961, their in-house designer, R. Hunter Middleton made many original additions to the family including:MacGrew, \\"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century,\\" pp. 264 - 267. *Record Gothic Condensed Italic *Record Gothic Extended + Italic *Record Gothic Bold + Italic *Record Gothic Bold Condensed *Record Gothic Bold Extended + Italic *Record Gothic Bold Extended Reverse *Record Gothic Thinline condensed *Record Gothic Heavy Condensed *Record Gothic Light Medium-Extended *Record Gothic Medium-Extended + Italic *Record Gothic Bold Medium-Extended *Record Gothic Heavy Medium-Extended Record Gothic is, again, a very inconsistent family, and has never been fully digitised. Yu Gothic is a Japanese font bundled with some versions of Windows, but the Latin glyphs look similar to News Gothic. The fonts are otherwise unrelated.

He has written four novels, his debut novel Remainder published in 2005 by Metronome and his most recent published novel, Satin Island, in 2015 by Alfred A. Knopf. Life and work Tom McCarthy was born in London in 1969 and lives in Central London. McCarthy grew up in Greenwich, south London and was educated at Dulwich College (1978 to 1986) and later New College, Oxford, where he studied English literature. He lived in Prague, where he worked as a nude model and in an American bar; Berlin, where he worked in an Irish pub; and Amsterdam, where he worked in a restaurant kitchen and reviewed books for the local edition of Time Out magazine in the early 90s, before moving back to London. McCarthy's time in Prague forms the basis for his novel Men in Space.\\"Tom McCarthy: How he became one of the brightest new prospects in British fiction\\" The Independent\\" 21 September 2007 McCarthy has also worked as a television script editor, and co-edited Mute magazine. Prior to his success he lived and wrote in a tower block flat on the Golden Lane Estate beside the Barbican. =Writing and publishing= McCarthy's debut novel Remainder was written in 2001 and rejected by mainstream UK publishers. It was published in November 2005 by the small Paris-based art publisher Metronome Press and distributed through gallery and museum shops, but not in chain bookstores and then received widespread critical attention in the literary and mainstream press, with one of its first reviews, in December 2005, on ReadySteadyBook who called it \\"one of the most important novels written in a long, long time.\\" The London Review of Books called it \\"a very good novel indeed\\" and The Independent claimed that \\"its minatory brilliance calls for classic status\\". The novel was re-published by the independent publisher Alma Books in the UK (2006), and the Bertelsmann subsidiary Vintage in the US (2007), where it ranked as an Amazon top one-hundred seller and entered the Los Angeles Times Bestseller list. On its American publication the New York Times dedicated the front cover of its book section to the novel, calling the book \\"a work of novelistic philosophy, as disturbing as it is funny\\". In 2008 Remainder won the fourth annual Believer Book Award. Zadie Smith wrote in the New York Review of Books that it was \\"one of the great English novels of the last ten years\\", suggesting it showed a future path that the novel \\"might, with difficulty, follow\\". It has since been translated into fourteen languages, and a film adaptation directed by Omer Fast was released in 2015.Editions have been published, or are scheduled to be published, in Chinese (Shanghai Translation Publishing House and Ten Points Publishing House), Croatian (Oceanmore), Dutch (Prometheus), French (Hachette Litt√©ratures and J‚Äôai Lu), German (Diaphanes), Greek (Papyros Publishing Group), Hebrew (Achuzat Bayit), Italian (ISBN Edizioni), Japanese (Shinchosha Publishing Company), Korean (Minumsa), Portuguese (Editorial Estampa), Russian (Ad Marginem), Spanish (Lengua de Trapo) and Turkish (Encore Yayƒ±nlarƒ±). Several big publishing houses who had rejected the novel returned to him with enthusiastic offers, which McCarthy rejected, commenting that \\"it's the same book as it was two years ago.\\" A work of literary criticism by McCarthy, Tintin and the Secret of Literature, was released by Granta Books in June 2006, with French (Hachette Litt√©ratures), Spanish (El Tercer Nombre), Italian (Piemme) and American editions (Counterpoint) following in 2007-8.Tom McCarthy, Tintin e il segreto della letteratura (Milan: Piemme, 2007). ; Tintin et le secret de la litt√©rature (Paris: Hachette Litt√©ratures, 2006). ; Tint√≠n y el secreto de la literatura (Madrid: El Tercer Nombre, 2007). The book attempted a reading of Herg√©'s The Adventures of Tintin books through the prism of structuralist and post-structuralist literary theory. It divided reviewers, with some critics disliking the book's references to Jacques Derrida and Roland Barthes. Killian Fox in The Observer praised \\"its author's obsessive approach, his breathtaking grasp of the oeuvre and the sheer exuberance with which he tackles his subject\\". However, in The Guardian, Kathryn Hughes criticised its methodology and style: \\"McCarthy's text has that pleased-with-itself smirk that was so characteristic of the early 90s, when journalists started purloining critical theory from the academy, liking the way it made them feel clever\\". McCarthy commented: \\"Granta asked if I wanted to write a book on Freud or Derrida or someone like that, and I said: 'Well, if I write about Herg√© I can write about Freud, Derrida and whole bunch of other people, plus it'll be much more fun.' It was received well for the most part. There were one or two hilarious English reviews in which you could virtually see the reviewer's veins bursting with little-England rage at the book's continental bent.\\" In 2007, Alma Books published his second novel, Men in Space, much of which was written prior to Remainder. It has since been published in many languages including Greek and French.Tom McCarthy, Men in space (ŒëŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøŒπ œÉœÑŒø Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÉœÑŒ∑ŒºŒ±) (Athens: Papyros, 2008). ; Les Cosmonautes au paradis (Paris: Hachette Litt√©ratures, 2009). McCarthy has also published numerous stories, essays and articles on literature, philosophy and art in publications including The Observer, The Times Literary Supplement, The London Review of Books, Artforum and The New York Times, as well as in anthologies such as London from Punk to Blair (Reaktion Books), Theology and the Political (Duke University Press), The Milgram Reenactment (Jan van Eyck Press) and The Empty Page: Fiction Inspired by Sonic Youth (Serpent's Tail). In 2004 he published an essay on excrement in the work of James Joyce in the online literary journal Hypermedia Joyce Studies. In 2008 an essay by McCarthy on Alain Robbe-Grillet, an author he has often expressed an admiration for, was published in the new Oneworld Classics English edition of Robbe-Grillet's Jealousy. In February 2015 McCarthy published a new novel titled Satin Island which was shortlisted for that year's Man Booker Prize; when he began it, he said, \\"It's going to have a leitmotif of a parachutist falling to earth, having realised that his parachute has been sabotaged: his relation to the landscape, death, technology.\\" =McCarthy's International Necronautical Society (INS) and Art= Since 1999 McCarthy has been 'general secretary' of a 'semi-fictitious organisation' he co-founded with his friend the philosopher Simon Critchley called the International Necronautical Society (INS) \\"devoted to mind-bending projects that would do for death what the Surrealists had done for sex\\". Having failed to interest publishers in his novels in 2001-2, he made art projects under the INS name. McCarthy handed out his International Necronautical Society or INS manifestos at a mock art fair organised by artist Gavin Turk. The INS operates through publications, live events, media interventions and more conventional art exhibitions. In a 2007 interview with the website Bookninja, McCarthy explained the circumstances that led to the formation of the INS: \\"I was quite well integrated into the art world in London by the late nineties, and on top of that I‚Äôd for some time had an interest in the modes and procedures of early twentieth century avant-gardes like the Futurists and Surrealists: their semi-corporate, semi-political structures of committees and subcommittees, their use of manifestos, proclamations and denunciations\\". Despite his initial claim that the INS was 'not an art project', McCarthy has accepted invitations to show work in his capacity as INS general secretary at art institutions around the world, including Tate Britain and the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, Moderna Museet Stockholm, the Drawing Center New York, Kunstwerke Berlin, Hartware MedienKunstVerein Dortmund, and Substation Gallery Singapore. The INS has been described by Art Monthly as \\"a group of wayward literati and sweet- talking parodists\\", and as \\"obscure\\" by The Australian. In 2003 the INS hacked the BBC website and inserted propaganda into its source code. The following year, they set up a broadcasting unit at the Institute of Contemporary Arts from which more than forty assistants generated non-stop \\"poem-codes\\" which were transmitted over FM radio in London and by internet to collaborating radio stations around the world. In 2008 a more mechanical version of this piece was displayed at Stockholm's Moderna Museet, in which an aeroplane Black Box transmitter sent out a stream of similar messages. In 2007, after McCarthy and INS Chief Philosopher Simon Critchley had delivered the 'INS Declaration on Inauthenticity' at New York's Drawing Center, the critic Peter Schwenger alleged in Triple Canopy that the two men who appeared in the gallery were not in fact Critchley and McCarthy. Taking his claim as an inspiration, McCarthy and Critchley did indeed replace themselves with actors when delivering the Declaration one year later at Tate Britain. When invited to deliver the Declaration a third time at the 2009 Athens Biennial, they announced that the Declaration would henceforth be outsourced to any institution who wanted it, and commissioned a Greek translation, which was subsequently delivered by Greek actors in Athens. McCarthy has made independent artworks. In 2005 he exhibited, at The Western Front Gallery, Vancouver, the multimedia installation piece 'Greenwich Degree Zero', produced in collaboration with artist Rod Dickinson, which (in a tribute to Joseph Conrad's 1907 novel The Secret Agent), depicted the Greenwich Observatory burning the ground. The piece was subsequently purchased by the Arts Council England's permanent collection. In 2006 he collaborated with French artist Loris Gr√©aud to produce an 'Ontic Helpline' for a fictitious 'Thanatalogical Corporation' ‚Äì a black telephone that transfers callers through an endless loop of pre-recorded messages. The telephone was displayed in the FiAC collection in Paris, and purchased by gallerists/collectors Solene Guillier and Nathalie Boutin. McCarthy wrote the script for Johan Grimonprez's feature film Double Take (2009). The script consists of a short story, loosely based on Borges's '25 August 1983', in which Hitchcock meets his double on the set of one of his films. The film won the Black Pearl award (MEIFF, Abu Dhabi) in 2009. McCarthy has also tutored and lectured at various institutions including the Architectural Association, Central Saint Martins School of Art, the Royal College of Art, London Consortium and Columbia University. Novels =Remainder= Remainder tells the story of an unnamed hero traumatised by an accident which \\"involved something falling from the sky\\". Eight and a half million pounds richer due to a compensation settlement but hopelessly estranged from the world around him, Remainder's protagonist spends his time and money obsessively reconstructing and re-enacting vaguely remembered scenes and situations from his past, such as a large building with piano music in the distance, the familiar smells and sounds of liver frying and spluttering, or lethargic cats lounging on roofs until they tumble off them. These re- enactments are driven by a need to inhabit the world \\"authentically\\" rather than in the \\"second-hand\\" manner that his traumatic situation has bequeathed him. When the recreation of mundane events fails to quench this thirst for authenticity, he starts re-enacting more and more violent events. =Men in Space= Set in a Central Europe rapidly fragmenting after the fall of Communism, Men in Space follows a cast of dissolute Bohemians, political refugees, football referees, deaf police agents, assassins and stranded astronauts as they chase a stolen icon painting from Sofia to Prague and beyond. The icon's melancholy orbit is reflected in the various characters' ellipses and near-misses as they career vertiginously through all kinds of space, be it physical, political, emotional or metaphysical. McCarthy uses these settings to present a vision of humanity adrift in history, and a world in a state of disintegration. =C= Opening in England at the turn of the twentieth century, C is the story of a boy named Serge Carrefax, whose father spends his time experimenting with wireless communication while running a school for deaf children. Serge grows up amid the noise and silence with his brilliant but troubled older sister, Sophie: an intense sibling relationship that stays with him as he heads off into an equally troubled larger world. After a fling with a nurse at a Bohemian spa, Serge serves in World War I as a radio operator for reconnaissance planes. When his plane is shot down, Serge is taken to a German prison camp, from which he escapes. Back in London, he's recruited for a mission to Cairo on behalf of the shadowy Empire Wireless Chain. McCarthy's novel C was released in late 2010, in the US with Knopf, in the UK with Jonathan Cape. It divided critics. McCarthy has described this novel in previous interviews as dealing with technology and mourning. The book was shortlisted for the 2010 Man Booker Prize. In response Tom LeClair described him as a \\"young and British Thomas Pynchon.\\" It was also shortlisted for the Walter Scott Prize. It has been described as \\"unquestionably brilliant, usefully denting the model of the psychological realism that is the dominant mode of our conservative times by its unique, disorientating glance at modernism\\" by Neel Mukherjee of The Times and \\"an avant-garde epic, the first I can think of since Joyce's Ulysses\\" by Jonathan Dee of Harper's Magazine. Leo Robson in the New Statesman review describes the book as \\"full of familiar delights and familiar tedium\\", with \\"Protracted descriptions of a pageant and a seance [that] drain the reader's will to live.\\" It continues \\"After a certain point, most sentences go something like this (not a parody): \\"Everything seems connected: disparate locations twitch and burst into activity like limbs reacting to impulses sent from elsewhere in the body, booms and jibs obeying levers at the far end of a complex set of ropes and cogs and relays.\\"\\" =Satin Island= Satin Island concerns a protagonist, U., who works for the Company. U. is employed as an anthropologist. The novel was released in 2015 and was shortlisted for the 2015 Man Booker Prize and the 2015 Goldsmiths Prize. Themes In a 2007 interview McCarthy claimed one of the main themes pervading his work to be that of repetition and duplication. The repetition in Remainder takes the form of re-enactments of events carried out by the wealthy post-traumatic hero in a process that some critics (such as Joyce Carol Oates in the New York Review of Books) have seen as allegory for art itself. In Men in Space it takes the form of duplication of an artwork, and a set of patterns repeating over several centuries. In McCarthy's art projects it has taken the form of repeating sets of messages over radio in a homage to Jean Cocteau's Orph√©e. Boyd Tonkin, in his Independent profile on McCarthy, picks up on the notion that literature itself is a series of repetitions and duplications. At least one critic has connected McCarthy's work to \\"failed transcendence\\", and McCarthy has used the term failed transcendence in interviews to describe the collapse of the idealist project in philosophy, art and literature. Failed transcendence forms a central tenet of 'The New York Declaration on Inauthenticity', an INS talk delivered in the style of a propaganda statement by McCarthy and the philosopher Simon Critchley in 2007 in the Drawing Center, New York. In a discussion with the artist Margarita Gluzberg, held in 2001 in London's Austrian Cultural Forum, McCarthy cites Georges Bataille's description of matter as \\"that non-logical difference that represents in relation to the economy of the universe what crime represents in relation to the economy of the law\\". In a lecture delivered to the International James Joyce Symposium in 2004 in Dublin, McCarthy again cites Bataille, drawing on his notion of \\"base materialism\\" to throw light on the scatological sensibility displayed in Joyce's novels. The detective in Men in Space is a radio surveillance operative who starts out boasting he \\"can always get a strong signal\\", but ends up losing the signal and then becoming deaf, cut off from all communication. In one interview, McCarthy discussed this character's similarity to Francis Ford Coppola's Harry Caul in The Conversation. McCarthy created an art project around Cocteau's Orph√©e, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 2004, which consisted of forty assistants cutting up text, projecting it onto the walls and then re-assembling it into cryptic messages which were transmitted around London and the world by radio and internet. This project was indebted to William S. Burroughs's notions of viral mediaTimes 23 June 2007 \\"Publishing? It‚Äôs an art form\\" and to Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok's notions of the \\"crypt\\", a space both of burial and encryption.

Product overview =Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM)= Synology‚Äôs primary product is the Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM), a Linux-based software package that is the operating system for the DiskStation and RackStation products. The Synology DSM is the foundation of the DiskStation, which integrates the basic functions of file sharing, centralized backup, RAID storage, multimedia streaming, virtual storage, and using the DiskStation as a network video recorder. Synology also provides free mobile applications for its users, including support for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and Kindle Fire. =Synology DiskStation= A Synology DiskStation DS213j NAS The Synology DiskStation is the network attached storage (NAS) appliance which is produced to run the Synology DSM OS. The DiskStation is a pedestal/tower embedded NAS appliance, which ranges from one bay to as many as twelve bays within a single enclosure. Some models feature storage scalability, where physical units may be tethered together for additional storage, without the need for volume recreation or loss of availability. = Synology FlashStation = The Synology FlashStation is an all-flash version of the DiskStation. =Synology RackStation= The Synology RackStation is a rack-mounted version of the DiskStation. It features all of the same abilities of the DiskStation with the exception that it is meant to be enclosed in a 19-inch rack cage. Some of Synology's rack models feature redundant power supplies. As with its desktop-oriented brethren, select models of the RackStation also feature storage scalability. =Synology Router Manager= The Synology Router Manager (SRM) was derived from the DiskStation Manager (DSM). The Wi-Fi router RT1900ac comes without a modem, but users can connect an ADSL or cable modem on the WAN port, or a variety of 3G/4G modems on the USB port. The RT2600ac supports up to 2.53Gbps while running a 1.7 GHz dual core CPU. It uses MU-MIMO and beamforming with a hardware acceleration engine. DSM extensibility Synology's software architecture allows for third-party add-on application integration. Hundreds of third-party applications are available in addition to Synology's own catalog. Command line access via SSH or Telnet is available. Access to development tools and APIs are also available on Synology's website. Third-party applications can be written in an interpreted programming language such as PHP or compiled to binary format. Public APIs allow custom applications to integrate into Synology's web-based user interface. Installers using the SPK format can install third-party applications directly on the DSM operating system. Vulnerabilities In 2014, a piece of ransomware emerged, dubbed \\"Synolocker\\", that targeted Synology devices.

This three million dollar project was completed at the end of 2001 and received final inspection February 2002. Breaking the record for the highest bell tower in Indiana, Shafer Tower is one of the couple hundred examples of carillon bell towers spread among the United States. Dedicated in 2002 to Phyllis and Hamer Shafer, Shafer Tower has become an unofficial landmark of Ball State University. It stands in the median of McKinley Avenue on University Green, the northern quadrangle of campus. A narrow staircase in the tower leads to the control room of the carillon, which has 48 custom-made bells. From here a musician can play the instrument on special occasions or for concerts. The bells are programmed by computer to play the Westminster Quarters to announce the time between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. One can also control the bells of the tower with a keyboard, which depending on how hard the keys are pressed, will make the bells chime louder. If manual operation is not desired, Shafer Tower is also ready to play over a hundred of already programmed songs. Due to a construction defect in the type of cement used to build the tower, most of Shafer Tower had to be built twice. Though other courses of action were considered, it was decided the tower had to be taken down and replaced March 2001. Completion was delayed as a result, however Ball State University didn't have to pay any reconstruction cost. The architect of record was Edmund Hafer Associates of Evansville, Indiana.

It is dedicated to the citizens of Gda≈Ñsk who were once buried in one of the city‚Äôs 27 graveyards either destroyed during World War II or bulldozed on purpose after the end of the war. The monument was designed to resemble a temple. The main memorial is surrounded by broken gravestones representing all faiths, and includes a poem by the Jewish poet Mascha Kal√©ko (1912‚Äì1975), whose poetry was burned on the direct orders of Hitler in May 1933. Project Designers The designers of the project are: *Hanna Klementowska, Jacek Krenz *Design Team: Katarzyna Bogucka-Krenz, Micha≈Ç Krenz, Andrzej W√≥jcicki, *Sculptors: Zygfryd Korpalski, Witold G≈Çuchowski *Funded by: the Gda≈Ñsk City Hall in 2002 It is located at 3 Maja Street in the park between the Church of Corpus Christi and the bus station. Stone and light, the symbolic meaning The layout of the Cemetery of the Lost Cemeteries echoes a temple interior. The colonnade of trees creates an atmosphere reminiscent of the main nave and side aisles. The stone columns are in the shape of trunks, symbolizing withered trees long since dead, but thanks to the light which pervades from within are brought back to life. The granite slab placed on a foundation of broken fragments of gravestones forms both a sacrificial altar and a symbolic tomb. The inscription which is engraved around the granite comes from a poem by Mascha Kal√©ko whose volumes of poetry were among the books burnt on the pyre in May 1933 on Hitler‚Äôs orders. Thus, from the ashes these poetic words will now speak again chiseled in stone to last. The lights set within the granite altar project upwards leading our thoughts to transcendence and thus binding the many burial places of various faiths into one metaphysical unity. These columns of light represent the firm faith of the people and seen within the light wisps of smoke from the votive candles remind us at the same time of the fragility of human life. Behind the altar there is a hedge cut into the shape of a semicircular apse which provides a final screen to this natural sanctuary. In the middle of the hedge there is an opening behind which we can see a wall of whitened stone - a symbolic passage for the dead who proceed towards eternity. The Living Memory The Cemetery of the Lost Cemeteries is meant to be a place of our common prayer commemorating all those generations who have lived and died in Gda≈Ñsk before us and whose place of burial no longer exists. It is a peaceful place for silent reflection, unifying all people regardless of their social status, race, nationality or religious adherence. Here the citizens of our town may ponder in peace the fate of their forefathers. Here they also may place the few remaining fragments which have been retrieved from the cemeteries which no longer exist. Thanks to the memories of individuals who will visit this place we will be able to recreate in our hearts a symbolic map of the common past of our town which - thanks to its close proximity to the sea and rich trading links - has always been the home to people of many different faith and nations.

Brunswick Heads is a small town on the north coast of New South Wales, Australia in Byron Shire. At the , the town had a population of 1,737 people.  History  Originally inhabited by people of the Bundjalung nation, the Brunswick River was charted by Captain Rous in 1828. His visit was followed more than 20 years later by cedar cutters whose activities led to the first town in what is now Byron Shire. By the 1880s Brunswick Heads was a busy port and a robust little commercial centre. The township went into decline after the construction of the railway through Mullumbimby in 1894. In time, however, Brunswick's popularity for family seaside holidays returned, and from the 1920s onwards its fame spread far and wide. Holiday cottages from that period are still in evidence throughout the town. The early camping grounds along the foreshores later became caravan parks. Poet and painter Edwin Wilson (b. 1942) started school at Brunswick Heads, as recorded in \\"The Mullumbimby Kid\\". Geography Brunswick Heads is a small coastal holiday village situated at the mouth of the Brunswick River. Nestled within the breakwater there is the safe and peaceful Torakina Beach, while a white sandy surf beach stretches to the south. The north bank of the river hosts a protected rainforest and the southern bank provides a harbour and small marina for fishing boats and small craft. Mount Chincogan and Mount Warning provide a spectacular hinterland backdrop to the river that meanders down from the small town of Mullumbimby (\\"The Biggest Little Town In Australia\\"). Despite the surrounding coastal development, Brunswick Heads has retained its traditional seaside village atmosphere. Timber bridges link the riverside to the river and surf beaches. Brunswick Heads is situated 10 km (15 minutes drive) north of the town of Byron Bay and 30 minutes travelling time from both Coolangatta and Ballina airports, and 40 kilometres south of the Queensland border. Brunswick Heads is across the river from Ocean Shores. The Pacific Highway bypassed Brunswick Heads in 1998. Roads and Traffic Authority, Brunswick Heads bypass duplication' Economy The small community of Brunswick Heads retains a mix of cafes, restaurants, specialty shops, accommodation and a variety of activities. Brunswick Heads offers a range of leisure activities all year round. Brunswick Heads also hosts a number of small scale community oriented and family friendly festivals and events throughout the year. In popular culture The town was the location for the cult 1980s comedy series 'Brunswick Heads Revisited', broadcast across Australia by the ABC.https://www.discogs.com/Angela-Webber-Adam-Bowen-Brunswick-Heads- Revisited/release/2721767https://highriser.blogspot.com.au/2010/01/revisting- brunswick-heads-revisited.htmlhttp://www.smh.com.au/news/obituaries/a-comic- delighted-by-the-absurdities-of-life/2007/03/21/1174153155683.html  References  External links * www.brunswickheads.org.au *VISITNSW.com - Brunswick-Heads Category:Towns in New South Wales Category:Northern Rivers Category:Fishing communities in Australia Category:Coastal towns in New South Wales ","title":"Brunswick Heads, New South Wales"},{"id":"7974690","text":"Location of B√©k√©s County in Hungary Murony is a village in B√©k√©s County, in the Southern Great Plain region of south-east Hungary.

SR 745 was designated in 1937, and its routing has not changed since. Route description Artz House on State Route 745, in downtown Dublin, Ohio SR 745 commences at the signalized intersection between the concurrent US 33 and SR 161 and High Street in Dublin. Running north from there, the two-lane state highway passes through a residential portion of the northwestern Columbus suburb. After crossing underneath a lengthy bridge that takes Interstate 270 over SR 745, the Scioto River and SR 257, the state route meets Emerald Parkway at a traffic signal. Now running in a north-northwesterly direction, SR 745 passes through a roundabout at Brand Road, then continues on through a residential setting up to the point where it crosses from Franklin County into Delaware County. Still within the city limits of Dublin, SR 745 makes its way up to a signalized intersection with Glick Road, just west of the O'Shaughnessy Dam, where the Scioto River widens out into the O'Shaughnessy Reservoir. Entering into Shawnee Hills, the state highway passes through a primarily commercial district, in parallel to the reservoir. SR 745 departs Shawnee Hills, and as it enters into rural Concord Township, it meets Harriott Drive, then crosses over a western arm of the O'Shaughnessy Reservoir. Continuing north-northwesterly, the state highway passes intersections with Cook Road and Merchant Road before arriving at a four-way stop intersection with Home Road. Now passing amidst a rural backdrop with a mix of woods, farmland and occasional houses, SR 745 intersects Duffy Road and Moore Road prior to arriving at its northern terminus, a signalized intersection with US 42 and SR 257 in Concord Township. SR 257, which crosses the Scioto River with US 42 just to the east of this junction, picks up where SR 745 leaves off heading northward from US 42.

The group were an electric string quartet fronted by a lead vocalist with an instrumental line-up which consisted of violin, viola, cello, and assorted percussion. The group was dominantly female and included some of the seminal female names of the late UK punk period, including Vicky Aspinall (violin), who went on to join The Raincoats and Mary Jenner (violin) who became a bassist for Leeds art house group The Mekons. Virginia Duff ( percussion and vocals) went on to become a television producer alongside columnist and partner Victor Lewis-Smith resurrecting Associated-Rediffusion to become a BAFTA award-winning company.. Lead vocalist Deborah Egan continued her career as a musician, after the group split in 1981, forming twelve piece The Mysterons and politically charged cabaret duo The Diplomats. She has continued with as a cultural entrepreneur working internationally and across the UK, she received an OBE for her services to the cultural industries in the 2015 UK Honours List. Deborah is the cousin of Andy Macdonald founder of Go- Disc Records and Independiente and shared the early success of that label which launched and discovered Billy Bragg and had its first UK No.1 with The Housemartins Caravan of Love in 1986. The name Acrobats of Desire was derived from the name of a chapter in Angela Carter's novel, The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman (1972). Mick Wilson (viola), who is now a successful painter, was one of the original members of the ensemble and the writer of all its original music. Acrobats of Desire were a mainstay of Edinburgh Fringe Festival in the late 1970s and early 1980s, performing on many Fringe platforms including The Festival Club, Hill Street Theatre, St Andrews Theatre and the Grassmarket stage. They recorded and broadcast for the BBC2 Late Show, STV and Tyne Tees Television. Their last performance was at Futurama on September 13 as part of the Sci-Fi Festival in 1981 supporting Siouxsie and the Banshees and Echo and the Bunnymen while in turn were supported by a band from Dublin called U2. The performance was recorded by Granda Television and broadcast in the UK in October 1981. Their EP, Parking Boys (Desire Records DES001) was recorded and produced by Camel's Andy Latimer at Foel Studio in Wales and mastered by Porky's Prime Cuts. It was distributed globally by Red Rhino Records and entered the independent charts in the UK and Italy it was featured by John Peel on his radio show .

They are less studied in physics because unlike the rotations and translations of Poincar√© symmetry an object cannot be physically transformed by the inversion symmetry. Some physical theories are invariant under this symmetry, in these cases it is what is known as a 'hidden symmetry'. Other hidden symmetries of physics include gauge symmetry and general covariance. Early use In 1831 the mathematician Ludwig Immanuel Magnus began to publish on transformations of the plane generated by inversion in a circle of radius R. His work initiated a large body of publications, now called inversive geometry. The most prominently named mathematician became August Ferdinand M√∂bius once he reduced the planar transformations to complex number arithmetic. In the company of physicists employing the inversion transformation early on was Lord Kelvin, and the association with him leads it to be called the Kelvin transform. Transformation on coordinates In the following we shall use imaginary time (t'=it) so that space-time is Euclidean and the equations are simpler. The Poincar√© transformations are given by the coordinate transformation on space-time parametrized by the 4-vectors V :V_\\\\mu ^\\\\prime = O_\\\\mu ^ u V_ u +P_\\\\mu \\\\, where O is an orthogonal matrix and P is a 4-vector. Applying this transformation twice on a 4-vector gives a third transformation of the same form. The basic invariant under this transformation is the space-time length given by the distance between two space-time points given by 4-vectors x and y: :r = x - y . \\\\, These transformations are subgroups of general 1-1 conformal transformations on space-time. It is possible to extend these transformations to include all 1-1 conformal transformations on space-time :V_\\\\mu ^\\\\prime =\\\\left( A_\\\\tau ^ u V_ u +B_\\\\tau \\\\right) \\\\left( C_{\\\\tau \\\\mu }^ u V_ u +D_{\\\\tau \\\\mu }\\\\right) ^{-1}. We must also have an equivalent condition to the orthogonality condition of the Poincar√© transformations: :AA^T+BC=DD^T+CB \\\\, Because one can divide the top and bottom of the transformation by D, we lose no generality by setting D to the unit matrix. We end up with :V_\\\\mu ^\\\\prime =\\\\left( O_\\\\mu ^ u V_ u +P_\\\\tau \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\delta _{\\\\tau \\\\mu} + Q_{\\\\tau \\\\mu }^ u V_ u \\\\right) ^{-1}. \\\\, Applying this transformation twice on a 4-vector gives a transformation of the same form. The new symmetry of 'inversion' is given by the 3-tensor Q. This symmetry becomes Poincar√© symmetry if we set Q=0. When Q=0 the second condition requires that O is an orthogonal matrix. This transformation is 1-1 meaning that each point is mapped to a unique point only if we theoretically include the points at infinity. Invariants The invariants for this symmetry in 4 dimensions is unknown however it is known that the invariant requires a minimum of 4 space-time points. In one dimension, the invariant is the well known cross-ratio from M√∂bius transformations: :\\\\frac{(x-X)(y-Y)}{(x-Y)(y-X)}. Because the only invariants under this symmetry involve a minimum of 4 points, this symmetry cannot be a symmetry of point particle theory. Point particle theory relies on knowing the lengths of paths of particles through space-time (e.g., from x to y). The symmetry can be a symmetry of a string theory in which the strings are uniquely determined by their endpoints. The propagator for this theory for a string starting at the endpoints (x,X) and ending at the endpoints (y,Y) is a conformal function of the 4-dimensional invariant. A string field in endpoint- string theory is a function over the endpoints. :\\\\phi(x,X). \\\\, Physical evidence Although it is natural to generalize the Poincar√© transformations in order to find hidden symmetries in physics and thus narrow down the number of possible theories of high-energy physics, it is difficult to experimentally examine this symmetry as it is not possible to transform an object under this symmetry. The indirect evidence of this symmetry is given by how accurately fundamental theories of physics that are invariant under this symmetry make predictions. Other indirect evidence is whether theories that are invariant under this symmetry lead to contradictions such as giving probabilities greater than 1. So far there has been no direct evidence that the fundamental constituents of the Universe are strings. The symmetry could also be a broken symmetry meaning that although it is a symmetry of physics, the Universe has 'frozen out' in one particular direction so this symmetry is no longer evident.

Although the date when the house was constructed cannot be determined precisely, architectural historians, noting that an 1865 ordinance map of the area does not indicate the house, date it to shortly after the American Civil War, circa 1870. The property was part of an tract acquired in 1846 by George Walter, who built several houses in the area prior to his death in 1890. The core of the house itself originally featured an encircling verandah, topped by a mansard roof. In 1931, the house was extensively remodeled largely to its current configuration. It was expanded again in 1964 with a north wing addition. In 1920, James Patrick \\"Pat\\" Speer, a Washington D.C. dentist, lived at Hickory Hill, along with his wife Susan Virginia \\"Jenny\\" Morgan Speer. At that time, they lived in the house with their five younger children, as their eldest daughter had already married and moved away. Pat Speer practiced dentistry in Washington D.C., in the same building where Clara Barton had previously conducted her work with U.S. Civil War veterans and their families. In July 1941, Hickory Hill became the home of newly appointed United States Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson and his wife, Irene, who, in 1955, after his death, sold Hickory Hill to United States Senator John F. Kennedy (D‚àíMassachusetts) and his wife, Jacqueline. After the 1956 Democratic National Convention, the house was sold to John's brother Robert F. Kennedy and his wife, Ethel, who had a growing family (eventually eleven children).

Oscar was a minister who belonged to the Central New York Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1901 Harris graduated from the Syracuse University School of Medicine. He thereafter pursued advanced study in Berlin. On Oct. 26, 1902, Harris married Virginia Boyd Dudley (Dec. 8, 1876 - April 8, 1946)http://www.wvculture.org/vrr/va_view.aspx?Id=35770&Type;=Death (Certificate of Death #4554 for Virginia Dudley Houghton) of Bramwell, Mercer County, West Virginia. In 1911 he received his commission as first lieutenant in the Medical Reserve Corps, achieving the position of Post Surgeon at Fort Totten, New York, and a few months later was appointed Post Intelligence Office at this installation. And in December 1917 he was transferred and assigned to his position on Governor's Island. On or about February 1, 1918, his personal assistant, Miss Natalie de Bogory, brought him an exceedingly rare book, a 1917 edition of Serge Nilus's book on the anti-Christ which incorporated into itself as an ending chapter the notorious plagiarism, literary forgery, and hoax subsequently known briefly as the infamous Protocols of Zion. This rare edition had allegedly been brought to the United States by an unidentified Russian army officer who obtained it in Petrograd, Russia. At the time of obtaining the text from Miss de Bogory, Dr. Houghton was a military intelligence officer of the United States Department of War attached to the Eastern Department offices located on Governor's Island in the City of New York. Noted bibliographer of Judaica, Robert Singerman, describes Houghton as a \\"zealous counter-subversive, obsessed by the [alleged] Jewish threat to America's war effort ...\\". Singerman further informs us that this obsessiveness led Houghton to engage Miss de Bogory, as his personal assistant, for 9 months, and he paid for her time and work out of his own personal funds. Essentially, he retained her, and another former Russian military officer, former General G. J. Sosnowsky, to translate the Protocols of Zion into English. The translation, entitled \\"Praemonitus Praemunitus\\", was published in 1920 by the New York-based Beckwith Company; the anonymous editor, disguised under the pseudonym \\"Peter Beckwith,\\" was Houghton himself.

Harold Faltermeyer wrote the music. Steve Stevens played guitar on the recording. In the film, the full song is heard in the film's ending scene. An edited version of the song without the electric guitar is played in the opening sequence set aboard the aircraft carrier deck during launch preparations - the music is set so that after the F-14's engines are on full afterburner and the aircraft subsequently launches from the catapult, it immediately changes to \\"Danger Zone\\" by Kenny Loggins. \\"Top Gun Anthem\\" won a 1987 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. The song's music video, directed by Dominic Sena, shows Harold Faltermeyer playing the piano and Stevens on electric guitar in a hangar with naval aircraft. This video was re-released within the 2004 Top Gun Collector's Edition DVD. The song was written by composer Harold Faltermeyer, who was recording keyboard parts for Billy Idol's Whiplash Smile album. According to Faltermeyer in an interview for RedBull Academy in 2014, at the same recording facility as Idol, Faltermeyer was in a control room composing a melody for a scene in the movie Fletch. Billy Idol passed by the control room on a break and opened the door for a listen. He liked the melody and pumped his fist in the air, saying it was ‚ÄúTop Gun‚Äú. Initially taken aback by any suggestion to turn a comedy theme into anything serious, Faltermeyer soon warmed to the idea. Faltermeyer asked Stevens, Idol's longtime guitarist, to play guitar on the track. Stevens was shown a clip of the film, and agreed to play on the track because he felt the film would be a hit. A guitar track had already been recorded on the demo that was given to Stevens. Stevens wanted to record his parts using one track, and avoid any overdubbing. Stevens used a Hamer SS signature guitar in the music video but for the recording he used his Charvel San Dimas Glow and a 100-watt Marshall amplifier to record his part. He also used a small Boss compressor pedal to add more sustain. There is only one guitar track throughout the entire piece, with the exception of the ending. The song is available on both the original Top Gun soundtrack album and the expanded edition. Personnel * Harold Faltermeyer ‚Äì keyboards, synthesizers, LinnDrum programming * Steve Stevens ‚Äì electric guitar Other uses The theme was played on organ as an intro to \\"Don't Need a Gun\\" during Billy Idol's Whiplash Smile tour.

Lawrence Taliaferro ( ; February 28, 1794 ‚Äì January 22, 1871)'Minnesota In Three Centuries 1655-1908,' vol. 2, Publishing Society of Minnesota: 1908, pg. 51 was a United States Army officer best known for his service as an Indian agent at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, from 1820 through 1839 and also as an individual who played a part in the saga of the famous African American slave Dred Scott.  Biography  Taliaferro was born at Whitehall Plantation in King George County, Virginia to James Garnett Taliaferro and his wife Wilhelmina (Wishart) Taliaferro. During the War of 1812, he enlisted at age 18 as a volunteer in a Virginia militia company. He was soon selected to study for a regular Army commission, and was made an ensign of the 1st United States Infantry Regiment in July 1813. He chose to remain in the Army after the war, intending to make it his career. Taliaferro partnered with Colonel Josiah Snelling to ensure peace and safety for the frontier outpost. His role was to mediate between the American Fur Company traders, the Ojibwa and Dakota Indians in the area, and United States interests. This was a difficult task, as evidenced by his diary: \\"How to get rid of me at this Post seems now the main object of Tom, Dick, and Harry ‚Äî so that those who may come after me can the more easily be bribed or threatened into silence and acquiesce in the plans on foot to cheat & destroy the Indians.\\" Taliaferro encouraged the Dakota to rely less on hunting and more on farming, as a response to their difficulties in hunting at that time. However, most Dakota were not willing to do so, as they considered farming the way of the white men. Major Lawrence Taliaferro Taliaferro had previously served with Josiah Snelling at the battle of Fort Erie in the War of 1812. They were close friends as well as professional allies. Chief Little Crow named Taliaferro \\"No-Sugar-in-Your-Mouth\\" for his ability to deal candidly and for his record of not making promises that he could not keep. Taliaferro built a council house just west of the fort in 1823, where he received Indian visitors and mediated in the affairs of the area. Both the Dakota and the Ojibwa would travel along the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers to the fort to seek advice and to ask for charity and favors. Taliaferro was able to exert his influence by carefully distributing supplies such as food, gunpowder, tobacco, and whiskey. The agency's blacksmith also was on hand to repair Indians' guns and traps. Since the Indians relied on these supplies and services, and since those services could be stopped at any time, this promoted peaceful relations between all parties involved. Taliaferro presided over the drafting of a treaty in 1837. He brought Dakota leaders to Washington, D.C., and negotiated what he thought were fair terms for Dakota lands east of the Mississippi River. Unfortunately, the United States government did not keep up its end of the bargain. The Indians ended up debt-ridden and desperate for their means of survival, and Taliaferro became increasingly critical of the United States' inability to make good on their promises. In poor health, he resigned his position and left the Army. Dred Scott connection Taliaferro was the owner of at least 21 slaves. One of them, a servant named Harriet Robinson, married Dred Scott. As Justice of the Peace in the territories, Taliaferro officiated the marriage of Scott and Robinson, which many historians believe gave additional credence to the Scotts' claim to freedom. Taliaferro gave Harriet to Scott's master so that the couple could live together as husband and wife. Tributes Taliaferro (played by local actor John Wehrman) is the lead character and narrator of the 1983 film, Tower and Braid, produced by the Minnesota Historical Society and shown regularly at historic Fort Snelling's museum.

Born in Saint-Marc, Hyppolite was a third generation Vodou priest, or houngan. He also made shoes and painted houses before taking up fine art painting, which he did untrained. Hyppolite spent five years outside of Haiti from 1915-1920. His travels abroad included trips to New York and Cuba. Although he later claimed those years had been spent in Africa, such as Dahomey and Ethiopia, scholars regard that as more likely an instance of promotional myth-making than factual. Hyppolite's talent as an artist was noticed by Philippe Thoby-Marcelin, who brought him to Haiti's capital Port- au-Prince in 1946. There Hyppolite worked in the studio run by Dewitt Peters, a watercolorist and schoolteacher from the United States who had come to Haiti to teach the English language as part of the Good Neighbor Policy. In 1944 Peters opened an art center in the capital that provided free materials. Before arriving at the Centre d'Art Hyppolite had painted upon cardboard using chicken feathers and sold to visiting United States Marines because he owned no brushes. Peters had first noticed Hyppolite's work in 1943 on the exterior doors of a bar in Montrouis, which Hyppolite had painted with flower and bird designs. Flowers could represent attributes of deities in Vodou symbolism, and although the doors had not been explicitly religious Hyppolite recognized interest in Vodou among art buyers and incorporated Vodou themes into his work during his time at Peters's studio. Andr√© Breton, a leading surrealist, traveled to Haiti in 1945 with Cuban artist Wifredo Lam. Lam purchased two of Hyppolite's paintings; Breton purchased five paintings and wrote about Hyppolite's work in Surrealism and Painting. Although Breton included Hyppolite among surrealists, Hyppolite's work was more realistic and religious than an effort to reproduce dream imagery. Nonetheless, Breton's regard for Hyppolite's work brought Hyppolite and Haitian painting to a wider audience. In January 1947 Hyppolite exhibited at a UNESCO exhibition in Paris and received an enthusiastic reception. The United States writer Truman Capote praised Hyppolite's painting \\"because there's nothing in it that has been slyly transposed\\". Hyppolite, a prolific painter, typically depicted Vodou scenes and created between 250 and 600 paintings during the last three years of his life.P. Schutt-Ain√©, Haiti: A Basic Reference Book, 113 Much of his work was influenced by his devotion to his work as a priest. However, after retiring from his work as a houngan, his work reflected the darker aspects of Haitian vodoo. He died at about age 54 in Port-au-Prince.

Samaggi Samagom is Thailand's only student association under royal patronage. It adheres to its original purpose as a locus for Thai students, roughly 10,000 in the UK, to connect with one another. The Thai Embassy in London and its Office of Educational Affairs (OEA) has a large presence in the association's activities, with embassy representatives, and sometimes the ambassadors themselves, attending Samaggi Samagom events. The close working relationship is reflected in a Samaggi office located inside the OEA, but mostly by embassy funding of Samaggi's academic events.  Samaggi events  Samaggi Samagom organises many events for the Thai community in the UK, including Samaggi Karaoke Night, Samaggi Bowling Competition, and seminars. The major events organised by Samaggi Samagom are the Samaggi Games and Samaggi Night, a concert. The association‚Äôs recreational events, such as its annual concert and sports day, are funded by Thai companies. = Samaggi Games = Samaggi Samagom's biggest event is the annual Samaggi Games. This is a sports day that involves several thousands of people, and is well attended by most Thai students as well as Thai expatriate workers in the UK. Many Thai companies use this opportunity to advertise their respective firms. The firms range from PTT to small Thai restaurants in the UK wishing to reach a broader market. Samaggi Games is open to all Thai students in the UK and hosts more than 1,000 Thai students from around the UK who come to play and support the games. Sports such as football, basketball, tennis, badminton, table tennis, squash, chair ball, and traditional Thai games such as Thai chess are contested. = Samaggi seminars = Seminars held by Samaggi in 2007 included the \\"Happiness Index\\", a talk by researcher Khun Nattavudh Powdthavee on the measurement of happiness; a talk by Gordon Bennett from Amnesty International on the death penalty; and a seminar on the future of Thailand's 18th constitution, which was being drafted at the time, led by Peter Leyland, a professor of public law at SOAS, University of London, and London Metropolitan University. Thai governmental oversight In 2011, the Thai Embassy in London intervened to force the removal of an article from Samaggi Sara, the group's annual journal. The article was a five-page interview with Giles \\"Ji\\" Ungpakorn, a Thai academic wanted by Thai authorities for l√®se majest√© who now lives in exile in England. The society was threatened with losing all Thai governmental support if it did not comply. Several days before publication, the interview was removed. Teeraporn Suwanvidhu, Samaggi President at the time, said, \\"I asked [the ambassador] whether he had...read the article, which I thought was balanced and not provocative at all. His reply was that it wasn't necessary, due to the...fact that Mr Giles' name is on the 'blacklist',...It's not even censorship. It's something more than that\\", she noted. Samaggi Samagom in 2016 faces even more hurdles from Thailand‚Äôs post-coup military government. Since the 2014 military coup no politically-related academic events have been held. \\"We try not to hold events that are too sensitive, otherwise it will definitely not be approved [by the embassy]\\", then Samaggi President Thanawat Silaporn said in early-2016. In 2011, when Samaggi was forced to censor the interview with Mr Giles, Samaggi secured the majority of its funds from the private sector. In 2012, Samaggi received 20 percent of its funding from the embassy. Samaggi currently refuses to disclose the public/private funding ratio, but said the embassy and OEA has provided about ¬£2,000 (102,700 baht) for academic events.

It is based on the sans-serif typefaces designed for American Type Founders by Morris Fuller Benton around the beginning of the twentieth century in the industrial or grotesque style. It was a reworked version of Benton Gothic developed for various corporate customers, under Frere-Jones's guidance. In developing the typeface, Frere- Jones studied drawings of Morris Fuller Benton's 1908 typeface News Gothic at the Smithsonian Institution. The typeface began as a proprietary type, initially titled MSL Gothic, for Martha Stewart Living magazine and the website for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. As Benton Gothic, there are 7 weights from Thin to Black and only 2 widths. When working for retail version of the font, the family was harmonized and given the new name called Benton Sans. In 2002-2003, Cyrus Highsmith added additional widths, weights, and italics to the typeface family, and the face was released for public use under the name Benton Sans. The extra weight and widths also served as optically- corrected replacements for Franklin Gothic, Alternate Gothic, Lightline Gothic. Like News Gothic, Benton Sans follows the grotesque model. Distinct characters are the two-story lowercase a, the two-story lowercase g, and a blunt terminus at the apex of the lowercase t. The tail of the uppercase Q is distinct for being located completely outside the bowl. The character set is compact, and descenders are shallow. The typeface differs from other grotesque sans-serifs in its organic shapes and subtle transitions of stroke width, all contributing to a less severe, humanist tone of voice. Benton Sans has a wider, less compact character set than News Gothic. The typeface includes text figures (old style figures) providing a refinement not available in News Gothic. Benton Sans font family originally consists of 26 fonts in 8 weights, and 4 widths for all but Extra Light and Thin families, which only include the widest width. On December 18, 2008, The Font Bureau Inc. announced the expansion of the font family. The expanded family has 128 fonts in 8 weights, and 4 widths for all weights, with complementary italic and small caps. Benton Sans RE (2010) It is a version of Benton Sans font designed by David Berlow for screen use between 9 and 18 pixels. Changes include exaggerate the glyph features, larger clearances between letter features, reduced stroke contrasts, wider and more open letterforms with increased letter spacing, larger x-heights, shortened ascenders and descenders.The Reading Edge‚Ñ¢ (RE) fonts - Ten font families, each with four basic styles, designed to function reliably at 9px‚Äì18px Other changes include 1-storey small g, addition of lower right tail in small a, truncation of vertical stem in cedilla, stretched top hook in small f, linked f bar to dotless i in fi ligature (Ô¨Å), semicircular O in capital OE ligature (≈í), small numeral 1 without bottom bar, 2-storey a in @, diagonal stem and leaned hooks in integral sign (‚à´), addition of lower left ball serif in small Greek mu and micro signs (Œº), addition of lower right tail in small Greek pi (œÄ), downward left hook in square root sign (‚àö), wedged acute and grave diacritical marks, circular dots in commas, quotation marks, exclamation marks, question marks, decimal point, division sign; stretched upper tail in partial differential sign (‚àÇ), wedged quotation marks in primes and back quote marks, smaller angle brackets in angle bracket marks, sharper lower tip in single dagger mark, sharper tips in asterisk, elimination of loop in pound currency sign (¬£), vertical stem in cent currency sign (¬¢), separation of plus and minus signs in plus-minus sign (¬±).

Haugen (born 1963 or 1964) is an American attorney who is the Founder, CEO, and former President of International Justice Mission, a global organization that protects the poor from violence throughout the developing world. International Justice Mission partners with local authorities to rescue victims of violence, bring criminals to justice, restore survivors, and strengthen justice systems. Haugen founded the organization in 1999.  Education  Haugen graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1985 with a B.A. in social studies. He earned a J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School, cum laude, where he was the Ford Foundation Scholar in International Law and a Tony Patino Fellow. Haugen also served as a visiting scholar in politics at the University of Adelaide in Australia.  Career before International Justice Mission  In the mid-1980s, Haugen served on the executive committee of the National Initiative for Reconciliation in South Africa. Chaired by then-Bishop Desmond Tutu and Michael Cassidy of African Enterprise, the NIR consisted of Christian leaders proactively devoted to political reform and racial reconciliation. Upon his departure from South Africa, Haugen began work for the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, based in New York City. In the late 1980s, Haugen conducted a structural examination of the Philippine government's prosecution of human rights abuses committed by its military and police. Haugen investigated multiple murders and other violent abuses by the Philippine military and police, and participated in the exhumations of victims and the provision of protection services for witnesses. In analysis of his investigations, Haugen authored a book published by the Lawyers Committee entitled Impunity: Human Rights Prosecutions in the Philippines. After working with the Lawyers Committee, Haugen began a career with the United States Department of Justice. In 1994, Haugen was put on loan from the Department of Justice to the United Nation's Center for Human Rights to serve as Officer In Charge of its genocide investigation in Rwanda. In this capacity, Haugen directed an international team of lawyers in the gathering of evidence against the perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide. Haugen developed the investigative strategy, protocols and field methodology for gathering eye-witness testimony and physical evidence from nearly 100 mass grave and massacre sites across Rwanda. Haugen personally conducted and directed field investigations at various sites. Until April 1997, when he left the Department of Justice to found International Justice Mission, Haugen worked as a senior trial attorney with the Police Misconduct Task Force of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, where he worked on police misconduct cases, and on cases involving various forms of human rights abuses. When Congress granted the Attorney General new authority to pursue enforcement action against police departments with patterns or practices of misconduct, Haugen was selected to serve on a small task force with national enforcement authority. Haugen currently serves on the Human Rights Executive Directors Working Group, the Board of the Overseers of the Berkeley Journal of International Law, and the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council on Justice. The Locust Effect In his 2014 book, The Locust Effect: Why the End of Poverty Requires the End of Violence (Oxford University Press) Haugen introduces and defines the term \\"The Locust Effect\\" referring to the all-encompassing and devastating effects of common, ordinary violence on the lives of the poor. From the book: ‚ÄúBeneath the surface of the world's poorest communities, common violence ‚Äì like rape, forced labor, illegal detention, land theft, police abuse and other brutality ‚Äì has become routine and relentless. And like a horde of locusts devouring everything in their path, the unchecked plague of violence ruins lives, blocks the road out of poverty, and undercuts development.‚Äù Former U.S. President Bill Clinton endorsed the book, saying that \\"The Locust Effect is a compelling reminder that if we are to create a 21st Century of shared prosperity, we cannot turn a blind eye to the violence that threatens our common humanity.\\" Other endorsers include Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Nobel Laureate and Founder of Grameen Bank Muhammad Yunus, Founding President for the Center of Global Development Nancy Birdsall, Founder and Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum Klaus Schwab, President of Oxfam America Ray Offenheiser, President and CEO of CARE Helene Gayle, Google Giving Director Jacquelline Fuller, Redeemer Presbyterian Church Pastor Tim Keller, Chief Executive of World Vision Australia Tim Costello, and others. Christian faith Haugen is an engaged Christian. He is a member of the Anglican Church in North America, and spoke at their General Convention in 2014.Gary Haugen at ACNA Official Website Since founding International Justice Mission in 1997, he has described witnessing a \\"sea change\\" within the \\"Christian community that was [once] largely disengaged from the struggle for justice in the world,\\" but now views care for victims of injustice as a significant issue in faith. Inspired by the work of historical leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mother Teresa as well as contemporary Christians in seeking justice for the oppressed, Haugen founded IJM on the principle of Isaiah 1:17 (\\"Learn to do good; seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow.\\" NRSV). Though it is a faith-based organization, IJM protects the poor from violence without regard to religion, race or any other factor, and they seek to partner with all people of goodwill.  Media, public appearances, and awards  In 2012, Gary was honored by the U.S. State Department as a Trafficking in Persons \\"Hero\\" ‚Äì the highest honor given by the U.S. government for anti- slavery leadership. In 2007, Haugen was awarded the Wilberforce Forum Award, an annual award presented by Prison Fellowship that recognizes an individual who has made a difference in the face of formidable societal problems and injustices. Haugen has spoken at numerous venues around the world including Harvard University, Yale Law School, Berkeley School of Law, Pepperdine University, Stanford University, The University of Chicago Schwartz Lecture, The World Economic Forum, The World Bank, The Clinton Global Initiative, Willowcreek Leadership Summit, Passion Conference, and TED2015. In 2009‚Äì2010, Haugen taught a course at the University of Chicago Law School on Human Rights and Rule of Law in the Developing World. In February 2002, Haugen hosted a policy briefing on international sex trafficking with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in conjunction with the events of the Reebok Human Rights Award. In November 2005, Haugen moderated a panel on human trafficking between Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY.) In 2015, Haugen testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at a hearing entitled \\"Ending Modern Slavery: What is the Best Way Forward?\\" Haugen and the work of IJM have been featured by Dateline NBC, The Oprah Winfrey Show, NPR, 60 Minutes II, The Today Show, Dateline NBC, NBC Nightly News, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, BBC World News, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes magazine, Need Magazine, Foreign Affairs, Christianity Today, The New Yorker, and The New York Times Magazine.

Leaves are gathered from any of several species of native tobacco (Nicotiana) or from at least one distinct population of the species Duboisia hopwoodii. Various species of Acacia, Grevillea and Eucalyptus are burned to produce the ash. The term \\"pituri\\" may also refer to the plants from which the leaves are gathered or from which the ash is made. Some authors use the term to refer only to the plant Duboisia hopwoodii and its leaves and any chewing mixture containing its leaves.Silcock JL, Tischler M, Smith MA. \\"Quantifying the Mulligan River Pituri, Duboisia hopwoodii ((F.Muell.)

Burke and Wills, on their ill-fated 1861 journey through inland Australia, were given food by local Aboriginal people and also \\"stuff they call bedgery or pedgery\\" to chew, which Wills found highly intoxicating even in small amounts.Cited in Ratsch et al. 2010. Wills W. Successful exploration through the interior of Australia, from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Adelaide: State Library of South Australia; 1996. Facsimile, original 1863 edition. A report from Western Australia described the smoke from burning pituri leaves being used as an anaesthetic during surgical operations.Cited in Ratsch et al. 2010. Herbert DA: The poison plants of Western Australia. Bulletin No. 96. Perth: Government Printer; 1926. Revised edition. Other nineteenth century reports said chewing pituri made old men seers, induced valour in warfare and allowed Aboriginal people to walk hundreds of kilometres without food or water; and a 1901 report claimed they \\"will usually give anything they possess for it\\". These reports generated significant curiosity within the local scientific community about the identity of the source plant and the identity of pituri's active chemical constituent. =Scientific investigations= In 1872, Joseph Bancroft, a Brisbane physician, received pituri leaves from south-west Queensland, and performed the first pharmacological investigation. He reported that extract of pituri is toxic to frogs, rats, cats and dogs, with a very small dose diluted in water and injected under the skin causing death after respiratory arrest in some cases.Cited in Ratsch et al. 2010. Bancroft J. The pituri poison. Paper read before the Queensland Philosophical Society. Government Printer; 1872. Bancroft received more specimens in 1877, collected on an expedition to north-west Queensland by the explorer William Hodgkinson and identified by Ferdinand von Mueller as the broken leaves and twigs of the shrub Duboisia hopwoodii. Hodgkinson was taken aback by Bancroft's assessment of pituri's toxicity, and said it was as benign as tobacco: Bancroft took Hodgkinson's samples to Britain and France where English researchers concluded the plant \\"is more closely allied to tobacco\\" and a Parisian chemist identified the active constituent as nicotine. This surprised Bancroft who had compared his extract from the first batch of pituri to nicotine and found the pituri extract to be much more toxic than nicotine, a finding confirmed in 1880 in experiments performed by Liversidge in Sydney on some new Duboisia hopwoodii specimens, and supported by an 1882 report that described Aboriginal hunters in central Australia steeping the leaves of Duboisia hopwoodii in waterholes to stupefy prey that drink the water, and other reports describing cattle, sheep and camels which ate it dying. Yet, when Liversidge sent more samples from yet another batch of Duboisia hopwoodii to England for analysis in 1890 the researchers replied, \\"there was no obvious difference between its action and that of nicotin[e].\\" Research into the identity of pituri's active constituent and its toxicity continued to yield contradictory results over the following decades.Cited in Ratsch et al. 2010.

Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. 1880;14:123.Cited in Ratsch et al. 2010. =Identifying the plant= Nicotiana suaveolens, sometimes used in central Australia as the active ingredient in pituri. Ferdinand von Mueller had identified Bancroft's 1877 batch of pituri as the crushed leaves and twigs of the shrub, Duboisia hopwoodii, and writers subsequently referred to Duboisia hopwoodii as the raw material of pituri. For instance, in his report on the 1891 Elder expedition into northwest South Australia and the Gibson, Great Sandy and Great Victoria deserts of Western Australia, Richard Helms noted, \\"Whilst these tribes have discovered the stimulating properties of Nicotiana suaveolens [a species of native tobacco], they do not seem to know the more powerful narcotic of 'pituri', Duboisia hopwoodii, which also occurs in many places throughout the same regions.\\"Cited in Ratsch et al. 2010. Helms R. Anthropology [Report of the Elder Scientific Expedition, 1891] Transactions of the Royal Society of South Australia. 1896;16:237‚Äì332. Then, in 1933 Johnston and Cleland reported that the plant Europeans usually associate with pituri, Duboisia hopwoodii, is not chewed across most of central Australia ‚Äì native tobacco is; and two years later Hicks and Le Messurier found in a 300-mile radius around the south-west, north-west and north of Alice Springs people \\"chewed, under the name of 'pituri' the leaves of at least two varieties of Nicotiana ... they wished to indicate that [Duboisia hopwoodii] was 'pituri', but only used when real pituri, i.e. Nicotiana, was unobtainable.\\"Cited in Ratsch et al. 2010. Johnston H, Cleland B. The history of the Aboriginal narcotic, pituri. Oceania. 1933;4:201‚Äì289.Cited in Ratsch et al. 2010. Hicks CS, Le Messurier H. Preliminary observations on the chemistry and pharmacology of the alkaloids of D.Hopwoodii. Australian Journal of Experiments, Biology and Medical Science. 1935. pp. 175‚Äì178. So, it was now clear that pituri is not one substance and the term relates to the chewing of the leaves of various plants including Duboisia hopwoodii and more than one species of native tobacco. =Active constituents= It has long been known that the active constituent in Australia's various Nicotiana species is nicotine. Twentieth century chemical analysis found that both nicotine and nornicotine, a drug four times as toxic as nicotine, are usually present in Duboisia hopwoodii, and the concentrations of these chemicals can vary widely. In one study, specimens of duboisia hopwoodii from Western Australia and western Queensland were found to contain mainly nicotine while the active constituent of South Australian and central Australian Duboisia hopwoodii was predominantly the more toxic nornicotine. It has been proposed that these variations may be due to differences in rainfall, harvest season and soil salinity and acidity. So Bancroft's and Liversidge's unfortunate experimental animals may have been injected with extracts of Duboisia hopwoodii high in the toxic nornicotine, while the specimens they sent to Europe for assessment (collected from different locations at different times) contained the more benign nicotine and little or no nornicotine. The reports of animal poisonings probably relate to the consumption of Duboisia hopwoodii high in nornicotine. Preparation and use In central Australia, various species of wild Nicotiana, not Duboisia hopwoodii, are used. Nicotiana gossei and a subspecies of Nicotiana rosulata called Ingulba are preferred. In a small area west of the Mulligan River in south-western Queensland, a distinct population of Duboisia hopwoodii, low in nornicotine, has been traditionally used and traded widely.Cited in Ratsch et al. 2010. Letnic M, Keogh L. Pituri country. pp. 61‚Äì79 in Desert Channels: The impulse to conserve. Edited by Robin L, Dickman C & Martin M. CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, Victoria. 2010. Fresh or dried leaves are broken up, mixed with ash and chewed to form a \\"quid\\" (a roll about the size and shape of a cigarette). The ash is thought to raise the pH of the mixture and facilitate the release of nicotine from the plant and its absorption through the mouth wall. Various types of wood are burned for ash including species of Acacia, Grevillea and Eucalyptus. Acacia salicina, whose ash is very high in the alkali calcium sulphate, is one of the preferred species.Cited in Ratsch et al. 2010. Peterson N. In: The Biology of Taxonomy of the Solanaceae.

Sydney:Allen and Unwin; 1999. The quid is chewed from time to time and held behind the lower lip or cheek for long periods, where the thin skin, richly endowed with blood vessels, readily absorbs the nicotine. It may be shared with others, passing from person to person until returned to its owner. It may be carried pressed behind the ear, under a breast or beneath a head- or arm-band ‚Äì possibly acting as a nicotine patch. A fresh quid may be prepared and held in the mouth while sleeping, so that for some chewers nicotine absorption is constant. Pharmacology At first, nicotine acts as a stimulant, boosting the production or availability of chemicals such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, beta-endorphin and serotonin in the brain and other parts of the body. After sustained use, though, the body's ability to maintain heightened levels of these chemicals is temporarily exhausted and nicotine begins to act as a depressant and in high doses may induce stupor or trance. Trade In traditional Aboriginal Australia there was an extensive network of trade routes across the continent and pituri was bartered for such goods as boomerangs, spears, shields and ochre. Name \\"Pituri\\" is one of several names used to refer to native plant matter held in the mouth for the extraction of nicotine. In central Australian languages the consonants p and b are interchangeable, as are t and d, and early European writers employed a wide variety of spellings. Joseph Bancroft, Australia's founding pharmacologist and the first to test its pharmacological properties, seems to have been the first to use the spelling \\"pituri\\". The term is used by Aboriginal Australians to refer not only to the leaf or the mixture of ash and leaf that is chewed but also to the shrubs and trees that are the sources of the ash and leaf.

The term topologically complete space is employed by some authors as a synonym for completely metrizable space,e. g. Steen and Seebach, I ¬ß5: Complete Metric Spaces but sometimes also used for other classes of topological spaces, like completely uniformizable spacesKelley, Problem 6.L, p. 208 or ƒåech-complete spaces. Difference between complete metric space and completely metrizable space The difference between completely metrizable space and complete metric space is in the words there exists at least one metric in the definition of completely metrizable space, which is not the same as there is given a metric (the latter would yield the definition of complete metric space). Once we make the choice of the metric on a completely metrizable space (out of all the complete metrics compatible with the topology), we get a complete metric space. In other words, the category of completely metrizable spaces is a subcategory of that of topological spaces, while the category of complete metric spaces is not (instead, it is a subcategory of the category of metric spaces). Complete metrizability is a topological property while completeness is a property of the metric. Section 24.

Completely metrizable abelian topological groups  When talking about spaces with more structure than just topology, like topological groups, the natural meaning of the words ‚Äúcompletely metrizable‚Äù would arguably be the existence of a complete metric that is also compatible with that extra structure, in addition to inducing its topology. For abelian topological groups and topological vector spaces, ‚Äúcompatible with the extra structure‚Äù might mean that the metric is invariant under translations. However, no confusion can arise when talking about an abelian topological group or a topological vector space being completely metrizable: it can be proven that every abelian topological group (and thus also every topological vector space) that is completely metrizable as a topological space (i. e., admits a complete metric that induces its topology) also admits an invariant complete metric that induces its topology. This implies e. g. that every completely metrizable topological vector space is complete. Indeed, a topological vector space is called complete iff its uniformity (induced by its topology and addition operation) is complete; the uniformity induced by a translation-invariant metric that induces the topology coincides with the original uniformity.

The interactive parts of the game were reduced to still images or omitted altogether for the Amiga version which, although never officially released by Ocean, was later included as a give-away game on a CU Amiga cover disk. An experimental port was produced for the original PlayStation shortly after its release. The Soap Opera Engine was manually programmed in TFX, but would be altered to become automated in future games. TFX was shown at the 1994 European Computer Trade Show at the Business Design Centre in London, England. An Atari Jaguar port was slated to be under development by DID but it never released. Reception Computer Gaming World briefly reviewed TFX in February 1994, calling it \\"the most advanced flight model yet\\" due to the many factors taken into account in the simulation, and further called it a simulator for \\"purist[s]\\". Another reviewer from CGW in April 1994 praised TFX's \\"excellent\\" effects and \\"detailed\\" graphics, but criticized the lack of a rudder and other examples of lack of realism, \\"predictable\\" computer tactics, the lack of a campaign setting, and an 'irritating' untoggleable autopilot. The reviewer concluded that \\"TFX feels old fashioned\\", further expressing that some aspects felt \\"unfinished\\", and recommended it only to casual pilots. Amiga Computing gave the Amiga version of TFX an overall score of 93% and highly praised its graphics, calling them \\"breathtakingly atmospheric\\" and stating that they were \\"designed to inspire and awe\\", and expressed that this \\"visual realism\\" give the game's missions further depth. Amiga Computing noted TFX's hardware requirements as 'demanding' for the Amiga, but noted that even with lowered settings TFX is 'more impressive than other flight sims' on the Amiga.

In the early 1900s, Chicago boasted the greatest number of production companies and filmmakers. Essanay Studios founded by George K. Spoor was one of the earliest successful studios to produce movies in Chicago, employing stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson. Actor and co-founder of Essanay Studios, Broncho Billy Anderson gave birth to the western genre. Early film companies such as Essanay Studios produced multiple silent films every week and rented viewing equipment to showcase the latest cinematography to the public. This rental culture gave birth to the popularity of Nickelodeons up until the Great Depression. However, due to the high demand for motion pictures during this time, a black market for films and equipment developed. The Motion Picture Patents Company, established in 1909 as a conglomerate of the major studios, sought to eliminate all illegal use of patented film equipment. As a result, independent ventures entered the film scene. Independents drove the film industry to the west to avoid legal trouble with the trust of major film companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company. The west offered fairer weather and scenery that better accommodated film making. Not until the 1980s and early 21st century has Chicago experienced a film production revival. Blockbusters, such as Blues Brothers, Sixteen Candles, and The Dark Knight, have rejuvenated the Chicago film scene. In the 21st century, Chicago further experienced a film revival due to a tax bill the state of Illinois passed to give filmmakers a 30% tax break on production costs. Beginnings of the Chicago film industry =Essanay Studios= Essanay Studio His New Job featuring Charlie Chaplin at Essanay Studios, Chicago'' Essanay Studios was a Chicago pioneer film company established in 1907 by George K. Spoor and Broncho Billy Anderson. Originally named the Peerless Film Manufacturing Company, Spoor and Anderson changed the name to Essanay by combining the first two letters of their surnames. Located on the north side on Argyle Street in Chicago, the firm grew to one of the largest film companies in the world before the rise of Hollywood.Scheetz, George (1974). The Chicago Film Industry: Beginnings to 1918. Dissertation, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign English Department. Urbana. The success of Essanay Studio was based on Spoor's and Anderson's appetite for innovation. Spoor was intrigued by Edison's Kinetoscope at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition but thought the invention could be improved. Armed with a vision, Spoor created the Magniscope, which allowed films to be projected onto flat surfaces. Spoor and Anderson installed, operated, and rented the Magniscope to many theaters around Chicago. The Magniscope innovation would eventually create legal battles between Essanay and the Edison Company and end up with the creation of the Motion Picture Patents Company. Anderson's film prowess came from on-screen achievement. He acted in the production of The Great Train Robbery, and became one of the first western stars. His nickname became, \\"Broncho Billy\\", for his involvement with western films. Due to his love for westerns, Anderson convinced Spoor to establish Essanay branches in Boulder, Colorado and Fremont California. These locations were perfect, especially the California location, because of the steady climate and mountainous landscape. Essanay Studios in Chicago was the capital of Chicago film in the first decades of the 1900s. Charlie Chaplin started his career in 1915 at Essanay Studios. He was hired in 1915 and paid $1,250.00 per week. Chaplin improvised the scripts that were given to him by adding slapstick humor. Ben Turpin, fellow actor for Essanay, and Chaplin worked together on slapstick projects. Turpin was cross-eyed which made him a natural sidekick to the antics of Chaplin. Chaplin's only full feature production at Essanay was called His New Job. Another notable actress who found a beginning at Essanay Studio was Gloria Swanson. Swanson would later star in many television and film productions including the smash hit Sunset Boulevard. Despite booming success under Charlie Chaplin, Essanay Studios soon faced a downturn. Chaplin did not like Chicago due to unpredictable weather conditions. After only one month of work, Chaplin left Chicago to head west. Spoor and Anderson soon hired French comedian, Max Linder, to take the role of Chaplin. Linder's rye humor was not appreciated by the Chicago audiences. The company suffered economically due to the inability to produce a popular film. In 1918 George Kleine purchased the studio to form a merger between Vitagraph, Lubin, Selig, and Essanay known as V-L-S-E, Incorporated which would eventually absorbed by Warner Brothers. The Essanay location would eventually be taken over by industrial film producer, Norman Wilding. Currently, the remnants of the studio are part of St. Augustine's College which built a Charlie Chaplin memorial theater on site. =Motion Picture Patents Company= The rise of the Chicago film industry in the early 1900s was a product of technological advancement marked by political strategy. In 1889, Thomas Edison and William Dickson patented the Kinetoscope. The Kinetoscope allowed a single viewer to watch a film reel through a small window. At this time, Edison did not see any practical value to the Kinetoscope and dismissed the invention as a toy. However, aspiring filmmakers began designing and patenting similar projection machines around the Kinetoscope that allowed a film to be shown to a large audience. William Selig and George K. Spoor of Essanay Studios in Chicago, the Biograph Company, and Vitagraph Company all improvised Edison's work. Film companies of this time period customarily both created movies and established a means of viewing. Despite initial ignorance to the Kinetoscope, the Edison Manufacturing Company responded to this innovation with legal action. According to the company, film outfits were showing motion pictures illegally because each of the improvised projectors violated the Kinetoscope patent. However, each film outfit had its own patent protection connected with individual innovations. Concurrent formation of a black market for projection equipment exacerbated legal issues. Following legal proceedings, the Motion Picture Patents Company was established on January 1, 1909. This coalition established a trust of the major film outfits in the United States. Firms from Chicago included in the Motion Picture Patents Company were the Vitagraph Company, the Selig Polyscope Company, the Kleine Company, and Essanay Studios. Provisions restricted movie making to these licensed firms. The trust also required outfits to pay the Edison Company royalties for use of the improvised projection equipment. To snuff out competitors, a rental system was put in place. Individuals operating theaters were now required to pay a $2 per week rental for films and projection equipment. =The Chicago independents push back= Exhibitors and filmmakers who refused to pay the newly instituted fees were not stopped by this new legislation. Independent companies were formed outside of this trust almost immediately. Max Lewis, president of the Chicago Film Exchange, announced he would not comply with the $10 monthly licensing fee on projectors. Within 48 hours of the formation of the MPPC, a Chicago- based combine of independents, the International Projecting and Producing Company (IPPC), formed to counter the MPPC's stranglehold. The IPPC, headed by the John J. Murdoch, general manager of the Western Vaudeville Managers' Association, dramatically announced the firm's formation with a $2 million base in the February 6, 1909 issue of Show World magazine. Individuals risked their own livelihood by operating independently. The major companies in the trust could sue any of these firms for violation of patent rights. Boom of the Chicago film industry =1900s= An Advertisement for a western produced by Essanay founder, Brocho Billy Anderson Chicago became a leader in motion pictures with innovative trailblazers and an interested public. In 1907, Chicago had more theaters per capita than any other city in the United States. Nickelodeons or five-cent theaters became extremely popular with the number of venues growing each year until the Great Depression. These theaters quenched the public's thirst for film and created solid neighborhood relations. Revolutionary in Chicago's film industry was the establishment of rental houses or film exchanges; in 1907, Chicago had more than 15 film exchange houses, such as The Stereopticon & Film Exchange, William Swanson & Company, Chicago Projecting Company, and the International Projecting and Producing Company, formed by JJ Murdoch as an independent Chicago-based exchange. These rental houses allowed exhibitors to borrow films at a reduced cost than actually purchasing them. This movement revolutionized motion picture viewership. It allowed patrons access to a wide array of films. The average viewer could now experience a variety of film disciplines for a small consumer cost. Rental houses also enabled theaters to change films frequently, keeping the film consumer interested. Chicago quickly became the leading film distribution market in the entire United States with control of 80% of the market in the early 1900s. Movie production also boomed. Production companies, like the Essanay Studios and the Selig Polyscope Company, dominated the film landscape. These two firms employed hundreds of people and churned out hundreds of films every year. Filmmakers shot their films outdoors due to the need for ample lighting with the primitive camera equipment. Sets took up entire city blocks at a time. The banks of the Chicago River were often used as a set for the westerns Anderson trademarked. Motion pictures were valued differently in the early era of film. Modern films are highly valued with vast amounts of resources being poured into the production value. In the early 1900s, films were viewed as products with a studio releasing multiple films per week. Decline of the Chicago film industry =1920s= The Chicago film industry met decline for a combination of reasons. The Motion Picture Patents Company, established to protect the major players in the industry, actually promoted the birth of independent ventures. These ventures sought to circumvent payment to the companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company trust. Independent firms granted creative license to the actor and often competed with the major firms despite the significantly lower budget. To avoid litigation by the Motion Picture Patents Company for patent violation, many independent firms moved west, literally out of the reach of the major production companies. Revival =1920s to present= Despite the transition from Chicago to Hollywood in the 1920s, Chicago remained on the map. Citizens retained an insatiable appetite for motion pictures, even though production had left the city. Chicago boasted the largest chain of theaters during the studio era (1919‚Äì1952). The Balaban and Katz chain, once small west-side exhibitors, bloomed their business into a citywide phenomena. Balaban and Katz owned movie and stage palaces such as the Chicago Theatre, Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre, and Balaban and Katz Uptown Theatre. High-profile film companies such as MGM, Columbia Pictures, Warner Brothers, Republic, Universal, RKO, and Paramount all held offices in Chicago. Movie production again entered Chicago in the 1980s with the state of Illinois becoming a leader in money spent on film production. Notable films from the 1980s include Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Color of Money, Risky Business, The Untouchables, Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and When Harry Met Sally.... Feature film directors returned to the city including Dan Aykroyd and the Belushi family (Blues Brothers, About Last Night, and Blues Brothers 2000), John Hughes (Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club), and Andrew Davis (The Fugitive and Chain Reaction). Chicago further fostered its new production boom with the passage of an Illinois bill in 2009. This bill provides a 30% tax credit on all production costs within the state of Illinois. Since instituting this law in 2009, many filmmakers have committed to Chicago for production. Recent films with Chicago as a filming location include Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Contagion, and Source Code. The new bill is supposed to benefit Chicago with increased tax revenue from $70 million in 2009 to $100 million in 2010. In 2011, Nick Mirkopoulos, founder of Cinespace Studios in Toronto, launched Cinespace Chicago Film Studios with his nephew Alex Pissios a Chicago native. The two chose to collaborate on a similar production facility in Chicago. They purchased the former Ryerson Steel complex in 2011 and the more than 60 acres in the North Lawndale neighborhood became Cinespace Chicago Film Studios, the largest independent movie studio outside of Los Angeles. Cinespace houses 35 sound stages, dozens of production offices and support spaces as well as numerous production tenants that offer equipment, casting services, post-production houses, a 3D animation company, plus camera and lighting rentals and sales. Since its inception, Cinespace has brought in more than 3 billion dollars in film-related spending. Cinespace Chicago Film Studios, is the ‚ÄúHollywood of the Midwest,‚Äù and has brought a multitude of digital media employment and education opportunities to the community and region by revitalizing a depressed neighborhood, and contributing to the creation of more than 15,000 jobs. Alex Pissios' leadership at Cinespace Chicago has been instrumental in infusing billions of dollars of revenue into the city and the state of Illinois. Cinespace Chicago has been the nexus for over 40 major productions, including the films Transformers, Divergent, and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice; various productions from Amazon, HBO and Netflix; and TV shows Empire and Shameless, as well as producer Dick Wolf‚Äôs ‚ÄúChicago franchise‚Äù Chicago Fire, Chicago Med, and Chicago PD.

Simrock with the English title The Water-Fay) is a symphonic poem, Op. 107 (B. 195), written by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k in 1896. The source of inspiration for The Water Goblin was a poem found in a collection published by Karel Jarom√≠r Erben under the title Kytice. Four of the six symphonic poems that Dvo≈ô√°k composed were inspired by works of poetry found in that collection. Poem Vodn√≠k tells a story in four parts of a mischievous water goblin who traps drowning souls in upturned teacups.The original Czech poem Vodn√≠k by Erben #A water goblin is sitting on a poplar by the lake, singing to the moon and sewing a green coat and red boots for his wedding soon to come. #A mother tells her daughter of a dream she had about clothing her daughter in white robes swirling like foaming water and with pearls of tears hiding deep distress around her neck. She feels this dream was a presentiment and warns her daughter not to go to the lake. Despite the mother's warnings, the daughter is drawn to the lake as if possessed and leaves for the lake to do her laundry. The moment she hands down her first garment into the water, the bridge on which she was sitting collapses. As the water engulfs her she is abducted by the malevolent water goblin who lives there. #He takes her to his underwater castle and marries her with black crayfish for the groomsmen and fishes for her bridesmaids. After the birth of their first child, the abducted wife sings it a lullaby, which enrages the water goblin. She tries to calm him down and pleads to be allowed ashore to visit her mother once. He gives in on three conditions: She is not to embrace a single soul, not even her mother; she has to leave the baby behind as a hostage; and she will return by the bells of the evening vespers. #The reunion of mother and daughter is very sad but full of love. When evening falls the distraught mother keeps her daughter and forbids her to go even when the bells are ringing. The water goblin becomes angry, forsakes his lair in the lake and thumps on the door ordering the girl to go with him because his dinner has to be made. When the mother tells him to go away and eat whatever he has for dinner in his lair, he knocks again, saying his bed needs to be made. Again the mother tells him to leave them alone, after which the goblin says their child is hungry and crying. To this plea the mother tells him to bring the child to them. In a furious rage the goblin returns to the lake and through the shrieking storm screams that pierce the soul are heard. The storm ends with a loud crash that stirs up the mother and her daughter. When opening the door the mother finds a tiny head without a body and a tiny body without a head lying in their blood on the doorstep of her hut. Composition Dvo≈ô√°k's symphonic piece, which is written in the form of a rondo,Clapham, New Grove (1980), 5:779. follows Erben's written verses remarkably closely; in many places the text fits literary to Dvo≈ô√°k's music.Clapham, Dvo≈ô√°k, Musician and Craftsman, p.117 This may well be a result of the fact that Dvo≈ô√°k derived his themes from putting Erben's words to music. This way Dvo≈ô√°k produced 7 themes, mostly four bars long for this symphonic poem. First the water goblin is introduced with a four bar theme starting three repeated notes. These three repeats prove to be vital for the whole composition: Most other themes start with three repeats, the timpani gives a three beat rhythm to the section where the girl wants to go to the lake, the church bells ring three times each at eight o'clock, the water goblin knocks three times on the door. Second the daughter is introduced with a lovely innocent theme, where the triangle gives her a sparkling twinkle in her eyes. However nice this theme may sound the basis is the same three repeat that formed the basis for the goblin theme. The great difference is in the way they are played: the goblin is in a staccato form presented, where all three notes are short and distinctive of sound, and the girl has a legato played theme, where the three notes are played long, and almost glide over in each other. The third theme introduces the mother with a suspense theme in B minor which makes the mood even more sad. Again her theme starts with three notes, though the rhythm of the notes is turned around. The suspense is formed by the chromaticism in the secondary theme. Later on Dvo≈ô√°k uses these two themes the other way around, as if the secondary theme becomes the primary, and primary the secondary.Rehearsal numbers 5 and 6 or bars 151 and 167 in the score The next section Dvo≈ô√°k changes from the minor to B major to indicate the persistent state of mind of the daughter when she heads off to the lake. In this section an important role has been given to the timpani, who play a solo, even though it is to be played less loud than the rest of the orchestra.Rehearsal number 7 or bar 197 in the score They again play the three note repeats, but Dvo≈ô√°k makes a variation on it as well. He changes from three 8th notes to five 16th notes and back and forth and so on. He might have wanted to show the spell the daughter is under, but for sure it makes the coming apocalypse more vivid than if he had only used the original 3 beats. This section ends with a ritardando (slow down), so the listener is prepared for a sudden fast and short swirl in the violins when the bridge cracks. The next section starts with a sudden E‚ÄìC‚ÄìG chord, as the girl hits the water. Dvo≈ô√°k changes key back to B minor for the water goblin theme, and he speeds up the tempo to a lively allegro vivo, which depicts the swirling waters engulfing the girl, for which Dvo≈ô√°k uses as well the Russian device of a descending whole tone scaleClapham, Dvo≈ô√°k, Musician and Craftsman, p.117This artificial tone scale was considered Mikhail Glinka's brainchild, but recent research shows that Schubert already used this; see Leitmotiv in Russia: Glinka's Use of the Whole-Tone Scale, by Mary S. Woodside ¬© 1990 University of California Press.

The program aimed to support locally made and marketed products of each of Thailand's 7,255 tambons (sub-district). Drawing its inspiration from Japan's successful One Village One Product (OVOP) program, the OTOP program encourages village communities to improve the quality and marketing of local products, selecting one superior product from each tambon to receive formal branding as its \\"starred OTOP product\\". It provides both a local and national stage to the promote these products. OTOP includes a large array of local products, including traditional handicrafts, cotton and silk garments, pottery, fashion accessories, household items, and foods. After a military junta overthrew Thaksin's government in 2006 following an election cancelled for irregularities, the OTOP program was cancelled. However, it was soon revived and rebranded. The One Tambon One Product movement is a selfish program effort wherein rural communities participate in the creation of a product that can be sold locally and internationally. Management and organization OTOP is managed by the Community Development Department (CDD) of Thailand's Interior Ministry. There are 36,000 OTOP groups in Thailand, each having between 30 and 3,000 members. Sakda Siridechakul, president of Chiang Mai's OTOP association noted, \\"OTOP has helped spread income to many people in the villages. It has allowed people producing handicrafts to feel they are part of the global economy.\\" Financials In 2017 OTOP product sales were 153 billion baht. The government aims for sales of 200-300 billion baht every year. The government allocated an 8.3 billion baht budget to the CDD to stimulate community tourism in 3,273 villages across the country between April‚ÄìSeptember 2018. Among the program's aims are to develop at least 64,570 new OTOP items with an average annual sales growth of at least 10 percent. In the FY2020 budget, the government allocated 363 million baht to support OTOP, down from 901 million baht in FY2019 and 1.24 billion baht in FY2018. OTOP Product Champion One of the mechanisms to promote and support the development of Thai OTOP products is the \\"Product Champion\\" (OPC). Besides setting up OTOP communities and small to medium enterprises (SME), a seminar called \\"Smart OTOP\\" has now provided more than 26,600 participants advice in improving their skills and knowledge in order to develop better products. The number of participants increases each year. A rating system for OTOP products is followed, the highest being five stars. At last count, there were 569 five-star products.

On the 10th of August, the French fleet encountered the English fleets of Admirals Howe and Byron. A tempest broke out, and Languedoc lost her rigging and steering. The 50-gun Renown raked her, but she was saved by the timely arrival of a French squadron led by Suffren. Languedoc was Estaing's flagship for his mission to America, with Boulainvilliers was flag captain. She took part in the Battle of St. Lucia in December 1778. Languedoc then took part in the Capture of Grenada from 2 to 4 July 1779. Languedoc returned to France, where she was refitted. In 1781, she set sail in the fleet of Admiral de Grasse. She took part in the Battle of the Chesapeake under Parscau du Plessix. At the Battle of the Saintes, Languedoc was under Captain Arros d'Argelos, and followed the fleet flagship Ville de Paris in the French line of battle. The French fleet was parted in two, and Languedoc retreated, leaving De Grasse to be captured. Languedoc then joined with La P√©rouse, and reached Brest on the 28 June 1783.

He played in the 1993 play-off final against Leicester City, a match Swindon won, thereby securing a place in the Premier League, and represented the club during their season at the top level of English football. In late 1992, he returned to Manchester United on loan as cover for Peter Schmeichel and was selected as a substitute on several occasions but never came onto the pitch. In August 1998, Digby signed for Crystal Palace, before moving on to Queens Park Rangers in 2001.

Soon after, in 1970, the theorist Oscar Masotta synthesized its contributions in the development of their own models of action comics (Oesterheld, Hugo Pratt), humor comics (Divito, Quino) and folkloric comics (Walter Ciocca) and the presence of other artists (Hugo Pratt and Alberto Breccia).Masotta, Oscar: (1970). La historieta en el mundo moderno. Barcelona: Paid√≥s. p.144-146. History =Early years= Front of Don Quijote magazine, circa 1890. The first cartoons to appear in Argentina were editorial cartoons in political satire magazines at the end of the 19th century. These cartoons, originally single panels, quickly evolved to multiple panel constructions with sequential action. Many used methods such as text indicating dialogue emanating from the speaker's mouth, or text below the drawings for dialogue and explanation. In the 1900s, comics continued to be largely political satire and commentary, but strips about normal life, called cuentos vivos (lively tales) began to appear. Text still frequently appeared below each drawing with dialogue or explanation. Comics continued to be published exclusively in magazines. Also during this time, translations of comics from the United States, such as Cocoliche (Happy Hooligan) by Frederick Burr Opper, showed up in Argentina. During the 1910s, the amount of comics made in Argentina grew by leaps and bounds. In 1912, the first Argentine comic strip proper, with speech balloons and recurring characters, Las aventuras de Viruta y Chicharr√≥n, by Manuel Redondo, began being published in Caras y Caretas. Later comics, such as Aventuras de un matrimonio aun sin bautizar (later known as Aventuras de Don Tallar√≠n y Do√±a), followed, and by 1917, Las diabluras de Tijereta was one of the lone strips that still put text at the bottom of each picture. Billiken, a children's magazine started in 1919, already included some cartoons. The popularity of comics grew in the 1920s, and children's comics gained popularity. The newspaper La Naci√≥n started publishing comics daily in 1920, and comics, both foreign and domestic, were a big reason for the popularity of the newspaper Cr√≠tica. In 1928, the first publication containing solely comics, the magazine El Tony, began its run of more than 70 years. The '20s also saw the first characters created (Andanzas y desventuras de Manolo Quaranta) and drawn (Panitruco) by Dante Quinterno. Also in 1928 Quinterno's most important character, Patoruz√∫, first appeared. The 1930s saw most important newspapers featuring comic strips. Patoruz√∫ had its own magazine, which began publication in November 1936. It became one of the most important humor magazines of the 1940s, with a record of over 300,000 copies printed for one edition. Also during the late 1930s superheroes from the United States, such as Superman and Batman, began appearing in local magazines such as Pif Paf (1939), giving a place to action comics. =Golden Age= The Argentine comic had its golden age between the mid-1940s and the 1960s, the so-called Golden Age of Argentine ComicsC. Scolari, P. Bertetti, M. Freeman, Transmedia Archaeology: Storytelling in the Borderlines of Science Fiction, Comics and Pulp Magazines, Palgrave Macmillan, 2014, ch. 3.1. ('), when a number of foreign artists, including many Italians, arrived in Argentina following World War II. Jos√© Antonio Guillermo Divito's magazine Rico Tipo, launched on 16 November 1944, contained many comic strips and was published until 1972. It included Adolfo Mazzone's classic Piantadino strip, Oscar Conti's Amarroto and many others. Intervalo magazine appeared in 1945, containing longer dialogs and text in comparison with comics edited in other houses. Patoruzito magazine also appeared in 1945, containing a number of children's comics in addition to the adventures of young Paturuz√∫. In 1948, local superhero Misterix got his own magazine, which also included other action comics, and which would become one of the most important the time period. Initially, it contained several Italian comics translated into Spanish, but later that gave way to local creations. The late 1940s saw the arrival to Argentina of a circle of Italian writers and artists, which further improved the quantity and quality of the comics in Argentina. These included Mario Faustinelli, Hugo Pratt, Ivo Pavone, and Dino Battaglia, who were known as the Venice Group. Some Argentines, notably Alberto Breccia and Solano L√≥pez, were considered honorary members of the Venice Group. A number of new publications appeared, such as D'Artagnan and Fantas√≠a. During this decade, H√©ctor Oesterheld, one of the most prolific writers, and Solano L√≥pez also created the Hora Cero magazine. Between the mid-1950s and mid-1960s, some of the most important Argentine comics were created, such as H√©ctor Oesterheld's El Eternauta (1957); H√©ctor Oesterheld and Breccia's Mort Cinder (1962) in the action genre; Quino's Mafalda (1964) and Mordillo (1966) in the humor genre; and Garc√≠a Ferr√©'s (1962) Anteojito y Antifaz for children. Another illustrator, Landr√∫, launched T√≠a Vicenta in 1957. Prominently featuring his own political cartoons and those of colleagues such as Oski, Caloi, and Hermenegildo S√°bat, its circulation grew to nearly half a million and became the most widely read magazine in Argentina before its banning order by the military government installed in 1966. Around 1960, of the 6 best selling publications, only one was foreign (Donald Duck magazine). Nevertheless, the arrival of foreign publications, mainly from Mexico, with better paper and ink quality and lower prices, started a financial crisis in the Argentine comic industry, and several publishers, including Oesterheld's Ediciones Frontera, had to close or be sold, which forced several artists and writers to go abroad. =Political instability= After the 1966 coup d'√©tat, the comics industry suffered from both some censorship and from recurring economic downturns. The 1968 biographic graphic novel of Che Guevara by Oesterheld and Breccia was removed from circulation by the government and the originals destroyed. Nevertheless, action comic magazines such as El Tony and D'Artagnan continued to publish both foreign and local creations. In 1967 Robin Wood's Nippur de Lagash debuted in D'Artagnan, and in 1969 a sequel to the Eternauta was published. Fontanarrosa's Inodoro Pereyra premiered in 1971 in C√≥rdoba's Hortensia magazine, which became one of the few successful Argentine magazines from outside Buenos Aires. The satirical humor magazine Satyric√≥n was launched in 1972, though tightening government censorship led to its closure in 1974. The same problem led Quino to put an end to Mafalda in 1973, after which he moved to Italy. Caloi created Clemente in 1973 as a secondary character in a comic strip centered on Bartolo the tram conductor; Clemente would however soon overshadow the conductor and became a fixture on the Clar√≠n back page until his own death in 2012. From their exile in Europe, Mu√±oz and Sampayo created Alack Sinner in 1974, which was later published in Argentine magazines such as Super Humor and Fierro. In 1975 Trillo and Altuna started one of the longest lived newspaper strips, El loco Ch√°vez, published in Clar√≠n. In 1976 while working on a politicized sequel of the Eternauta that was being published in Skorpio, Oesterheld was kidnapped and disappeared by military government forces. A year later his four daughters, all leftist students, disappeared as well. 1978 saw the birth of satirical current events magazine Humo¬Æ by Andr√©s Cascioli and Ediciones de la Urraca. One of the first attempts of erotic comic was the 1979 Las puertitas del Sr. L√≥pez by Altuna-Trillo, later published in Humor and Fierro (1984). =Renaissance= The return of democracy in late 1983 ended years of military censorship. A new cultural wave started in several arts. Applying the specialized anthology format in the tradition of magazines like the French Metal Hurlant and Pilote, Argentine creators began publishing Fierro; The magazine had a 100 issue run, from 1984 until 1991. In 2006, the newspaper publisher P√°gina/12 initiated a second volume of the magazine. =The rise of self-publishing= Argentine creators started producing self-published zines in the 1980s. History of Argentine Comics This trend intensified during the 1990s with magazines such as El Cazador or Ultra. Participants in this trend attribute the boom to both economic and cultural factors. On the economic side, technological developments and national crisis facilitated the dissemination of new methods. Increased availability of personal computers enabled creators to format, edit and print their own work. Other factors that contributed to the boom resulted from a crisis in traditional methods of production and distribution. In the 1990s, pro-trade reforms made it more difficult for local products to compete. Suffering a similar fate to many sectors of the Argentine media and industry in general, the comic magazines still working during the 1980s slowly decreased in quality and died off (e.g. Fierro, D'Artagnan, Nippur). While many creators found work in other countries or changed professions, others continued to reach local audiences by publishing and distributing their own work. Another side-effect of the crisis was that many creators started offering workshops for children and teens because job markets were tight. Passing on their own methods, creators armed a new generation of creators with self-publishing techniques. Cultural factors that creators cite as shaping the self-publishing boom include a desire to read and produce stories that deal with local issues by local authors, a strong sense of autonomy matched by a tradition of collaboration and a commitment to free creative expression. AHI-Rosario Competing in a difficult market, Argentine creators have experimented with various formats and forms of collective self-help. At first, self-published works remained in dark corners of the comic shops and (less so) news stands and most of them failed to survive past the 2nd or 3rd issue (i.e. Ultra). To collectively address the challenges of independent publishing, creators formed the Asociaci√≥n de Historietistas Independientes (Association of Independent Comic Creators, AHI), at the 1996 Fantabaires convention, from which later the group La Productora split. Productora Costs are sometimes shared, as in the case of publishing house Ex Abrupto, which co-publishes Suda Mery K!, a biannual anthology, with Vi√±etas con Altura of Bolivia and Feroces Editores of Chile.

Originally, Rabbi Avraham Sacharov was designated as first rosh yeshiva, but Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz asked William Joynson Hicks, the Home Secretary, to block Sacharov's immigration in an attempt to prevent the establishment of a yeshiva outside his jurisdiction.

The original building procured by the yeshiva was at 179 Bewick Road. As the yeshiva expanded it acquired neighbouring properties in Rectory Road and 177 Bewick Road. In 1961 a new building was erected at 88 Windermere Street to house a new beth hamedresh (the hall used for study and prayer), with the dining room on the floor below and the kitchens in the basement. The old beth hamedrash building at 179 Bewick Road and neighbouring houses in Rectory Road were demolished to make way for a new two-storey dormitory block, Clore House, which was opened in 1963, forming the beginnings of the yeshiva campus. A later three-storey building further up Bewick Road joined the first dormitory block, and attached the yeshiva dormitories with the back of the study hall via a bridge. Later on,in 1992, a new building, Sebba House was built, which consisted of a state-of-the-art dormitory building for about 70 students. Later, in 1997 a new building, Tiferes Yonasan, was erected, which attached the study hall further down Windermere Street to the dormitories and extended the main building, including the study hall and the dining room. The last extension on the right hand side added more lecture halls. In addition these extensions created a courtyard leading on from the back alley, from Rydal Street.  Hashkafa  The yeshiva was originally established as a branch of the Novardok network of yeshivas then existing in Eastern Europe. The primary focal point of Novahrdock hashkafa is extreme reliance on Divine providence and commitment to achieving spiritual goals without feeling encumbered by physical and material constraints.

The leaves are bipinnate, glaucous blue-green to silvery grey, 1‚Äì12 cm (occasionally to 17 cm) long and 1‚Äì11 cm broad, with 6‚Äì30 pairs of pinnae, each pinna divided into 10‚Äì68 pairs of leaflets; the leaflets are 0.7‚Äì6 mm long and 0.4‚Äì1 mm broad. The flowers are produced in large racemose inflorescences made up of numerous smaller globose bright yellow flowerheads of 13‚Äì42 individual flowers. The fruit is a flattened pod 2‚Äì11.5 cm long and 6‚Äì14 mm broad, containing several seeds.Flora of Australia Online: Acacia dealbata Trees generally do not live longer than 30 to 40 years, after which in the wild they are succeeded by other species where bushfires are excluded. In moist mountain areas, a white lichen can almost cover the bark, which may contribute to the descriptor \\"silver\\". The Latin specific epithet dealbata also means \\"covered in a white powder\\". =Chemistry= It has been analyzed as containing less than 0.02% alkaloids.Chemotaxonomie der Pflanzen By Robert Hegnauer It is known to contain enanthic (heptanoic) acid, palmic aldehyde, anisic acid, acetic acid, and phenols.Mimosa Essential Oil Taxonomy Along with other bipinnate wattles, Acacia dealbata is classified in the section Botrycephalae within the subgenus Phyllodineae in the genus Acacia. An analysis of genomic and chloroplast DNA along with morphological characters found that the section is polyphyletic, though the close relationships of many species were unable to be resolved. Acacia dealbata appears to be most closely related to A. mearnsii, A. nanodealbata and A. baileyana. Some authorities consider A. dealbata to be a variant of Acacia decurrens. =Subspecies= There are two subspecies: *A. dealbata subsp. dealbata. Low to moderate altitudes.

They are usually located at high elevations, under conditions of sufficient air humidity but poor soil. There are two main dwarf forest ecosystem types, involving different species and environmental characteristics: coastal temperate and montane tropical regions. Temperate coastal dwarf forest is common for parts of Southern California. Montane tropical forests are found across tropical highlands of Central America, northern South America and Southeast Asia. There are also other isolated examples of dwarf forests scattered across the world, while the largest dwarf forest is found in the Philippines. High-altitude tropical dwarf forest Elfin forest on Mt. Kemiri, Sumatra, at an altitude of about 3000 m High- altitude tropical locations in cloud forests contain mossy wet elfin forests due to high-altitude precipitation. These regions are characterized by low rainfall, with most of the water in the form of mist and fog. The water supplied is primarily available during the night, when clouds move from the ocean over the mountains, and are intercepted by the vegetation. During the day, water demands are increased as clouds rise over the mountain peaks without dissipating into available forms of precipitation. The forests are characterized by small trees (5-8m), with shallow root systems, and abundant epiphytes. The epiphytes make up a large portion of the canopy, with greater abundances in high-altitude tropical elfin forests than what is found in other, non-elfin, tropical forests. Dwarf forests should be more commonly found on isolated mountains due to the massenerhebung effect. The massenerhebung effect is a phenomenon where treelines are typically higher among mountains in close proximity to other mountains. The mountains in close proximity affect the rate of wind and heat retention, decreasing the negative effects of climate. When the treeline is lower on isolated mountains, the climatic effects are more severe. = Flora = Within montane dwarf forests, there are relatively few species with a small number of dominant species that make up a large portion of the population. Low, horizontally branching, shrub- like plants, and dense populations of moss, lichen, and liverworts are found due to high wind speeds, low temperatures and light reduction from persistent clouds and fog, which limit the growth of tall plants. The high wind speeds act as the determining factor of the stature in dwarf forest flora, especially on ridges and slopes. A low stature increases the structural stability of the plants. Wind-exposed trees invest more of their resources to increasing strength than to growth, compared to non-wind exposed trees. The increased focus on strengthening leads to thicker trunks and twigs, which increases the ability of the trees to withstand greater wind stresses near the ridge-crest, where the majority of wind-exposed trees are found. A large percentage of energy is also allocated to growing and maintaining heavy and extensive root structures, further strengthening the tree and increasing its resistance to high winds. Plants here have leaves with moisture-tolerant characteristics, such as drip tips and waxy cuticles. They also have a slow rate of transpiration and metabolism due to low temperatures and low radiation penetration. A large percentage of plants possess alkaloids and other natural products, likely to combat a high amount of herbivory from insects. This may also account for the low leaf surface area and low transpiration rates of the plants. One study showed that leaves of ten plant species had approximately 70-98% of all leaves damaged by insects. = Fauna = Elfin forests occur at high elevations which are generally associated with low vertebrate biodiversity. Hummingbirds and bats make up large proportion of vertebrates in some areas, usually as altitudinal migrants during seasonal shifts, such as for reproduction, or in response to food abundance. Other vertebrate species mostly include small rodents. = Seasonal variations = Rainfall tends to be highly seasonal, sparse, and far between, therefore fog interception is a significant water source during dry seasons. Throughout the year, wind speed, temperature and humidity are fairly consistent, with humidity usually greater than 90%. At one study site in the Guajira Peninsula, dry season precipitation ranged from 1‚Äì4 days per month, while in the wet season, although increased, it was still a relatively low 4 to 12 days per month, supporting the idea that the majority of the water in this region is held in low cloud cover and fog interception. Sunshine duration is distributed bimodally and correlates with evaporation rates. =Examples= Mount Hamiguitan pygmy forest in the Philippines * Pygmy forest of Mount Hamiguitan on Mindanao, Philippines at the altitude of 1160‚Äì1200 m a.s.l.). It is a national park and a protected area since 2004 and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2014. It is estimated to have around 1,380 different species; with 341 endemic to the Philippines (including the Philippine eagle, the Philippine cockatoo and the Philippine tarsier). Several species are endemic to Mount Hamiguitan itself, like the Mount Hamiguitan pitcher plant (Nepenthes hamiguitanensis), the Mount Hamiguitan fern (Lindsaea hamiguitanensis) and the butterfly (Delias magsadana). At the extensive pygmy forest of Mount Hamiguitan is the largest known dwarf forest in the Philippines and possibly the world. It merges with mossy forests, dipterocarp forests, and montane forests at lower elevations. * El Yunque National Forest of Puerto Rico features dwarf forest areas at altitudes above 900 m, as does Los Tres Picachos State Forest. Coastal temperate elfin forest Pygmy forest at Salt Point State Park in northern California Elfin forests of California are the primary example of coastal temperate dwarf forests. They are expansive, and cover most of the mountains in the southern half of California, extending into Mexico, Nevada, and Arizona. Other expanses of elfin forest are found throughout the state, in the northern and central regions. In northern California, Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park is home to an elfin forest with Mendocino cypress (Cupressus pigmaea), and Sargent's cypress (C. sargentii), which is partially within a section of the Zayante Sandhill Area. On the Central Coast of California, on the southeastern shore of Morro Bay, Los Osos contains the El Moro Elfin Forest Natural Area. The area is approximately 90 acres. It derives the ‚Äúelfin forest‚Äù title from the short California live oaks, which range in height from 4 ‚Äì 20 feet, compared to the typical 30‚Äì80 feet. This region also contains the federally endangered Morro shoulderband snail (Helminthoglypta walkeriana). At a higher altitude, on Cuesta Ridge, the Land Conservancy of San Luis Obispo County manages the San Luis Obispo Elfin Forest of dwarf cypresses. Factors such as soil moisture, solar radiation, and rockiness of soil influence species composition along an elevation gradient, resulting in certain shrub species, such as Adenostoma fasciculatum and Arctostaphylos glauca, being present in elfin forest habitats. Fire occurs at low-moderate frequency with high severity. Many plants have adapted to this by having serotinous seeds that open to germinate only under high heat. Because of this, they are often the first to colonize a new area. Pygmy coast live oaks in elfin forest, California = Flora = Chaparral areas can be waterlogged in the winter, and arid and desert-like in the summer, native plants in these dry elfin forests are generally much shorter, smaller, and compact than related plants elsewhere. Some of the plants commonly found in Californian elfin forests, including many introduced species, are: diminutive plants such as Mount Hood pussypaws (Cistanthe umbellata), alkali heath (Frankenia salina), and species of Aeonium and bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus); and trees and shrubs such as chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), manzanita (Arctostaphylos), Ceanothus, sumac (Rhus), sage (Salvia) and scrub-oak (Quercus berberidifolia) which naturally grow less than 20 ft (7m) tall. = Fauna = Californian elfin forest fauna includes many species of deer mice (Peromyscus spp.), harvest mice (Reithrodontomys spp.), California vole (Microtus californicus), California pocket mouse (Chaetodipus californicus), kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spp.) and several species of spiny lizards (Sceloporus spp.), along with other small vertebrates. Invertebrates include burrowing scorpions (Opistophthalmus spp.), and various species of scorpions, spiders and ticks. =Seasonal variations= The Californian climate usually exhibits wet winters and dry summers. Plants found in elfin forests grow during winter months, and become dormant during the summer due to drought stress. Plant communities also rely on taking in moisture from the air by intercepting fog to supplement the low, seasonal rainfall. =Formation= Trail signs at Salt Point alert hikers they are entering a pygmy forested region Formation of coastal elfin forests in northern California and Oregon, began with a series of marine terraces. A combination of uplift and changes in ocean level formed a system of terraces, resulting in an ‚Äúecological staircase‚Äù, with each terrace approximately 100,000 years older than the one below it and supporting a distinct association of soils, microbes, plants, and animals. A dune being pushed farther away from the coast by fluctuating sea levels slides over the one before it and solidifies, raising the terraces. Pioneer plant communities colonize the young terrace. The succession of plant communities that repeats on each terrace eventually forms a very specific podzol known as the Blacklock series,https://soilseries.sc.egov.usda.gov/OSD_Docs/B/BLACKLOCK.html which offers an inhospitable environment for species and greatly stunts further growth on the terrace. Part of this soil profile includes an underlying clay or iron hardpan. Each terrace is relatively level and many are footed by paleo-dunes. Drainage is poor at best on these stairs and plants sit in a bath of their own tannins and acids for much of the wet season. Due to limited root mobility and acidic soil, plant communities on these terraces grow into stunted forms. Remnants of ecological staircases doubtless exist, however most have been destroyed for development or logging. Analyses of pygmy forest soils show low levels of macro- and micronutrients, and high levels of exchangeable aluminium, which limits the ability of plants to grow. Low pH conditions support formation of an iron hardpan, preventing the trees from setting deep roots and preventing internal drainage of soil water. As a result, the pine trees in the area are rarely more than three or four feet high, in a sort of natural bonsai effect. Many of the tree trunks, though only an inch thick, contain 80 or more growth rings. Only yards away, but with younger soils, the same species of tree grows many dozens of feet high. =Examples= Examples of high-terrace podzol pygmy forests include: * Mendocino pygmy forest in Mendocino County, California, for example, is an oligotrophic community caused by podzolized (nutrient-poor, highly acidic) soils. The forest flora is dominated by dwarfed bishop pine, bolander pine (a variety of shore pine), and Cupressus pigmaea. Bishop pine occurs in both dwarfed and full size form, the latter being trees whose roots have broken through the hardpan layer into the more fertile soil beneath. This forest is found in several discontinuous areas, with significant portions on the following public lands: **Jug Handle State Natural Reserve, where it is the feature of the highest portion of the Ecological Staircase Trail. Adjacent, to the east, is the Pygmy Forest National Natural Landmark. within Jackson Demonstration State Forest. ** Russian Gulch State Park. ** Jackson Demonstration State Forest includes a large pygmy forest area east of the towns of Mendocino and Casper. ** The Hans Jenny Pygmy Forest Reserve, co-managed by the University of California Natural Reserve System and The Nature Conservancy. ** Within the Van Damme State Park is the Charlotte M. Hoak Pygmy Forest, located along the northern border of the park. A second pygmy forest location on the southern border has a self- guided nature trail built entirely on an elevated walkway forming a short loop through the site. * Salt Point State Park in Sonoma County, California has a much smaller pygmy forest and a fifth terrace prairie ranging from 900 to 1000 feet and formerly supporting elk populations. Like the Mendocino forest, the dominant trees are also bishop pine, bolander pine, and C. pigmaea. Most of Salt Point is on the northernmost portion of the Salinian Block and the terrace staircase drops suddenly into the gulch that lies over the San Andreas fault. * SFB Morse Botanical Reserve in the Del Monte Forest of the Monterey Peninsula is centered on the small Huckleberry Hill pygmy forest of bishop pine and C. goveniana, in the middle of a more extensive forest of Monterey pine. Bishop pine, which tolerates extreme podzol conditions better than Monterey pine, is found in the most heavily podzolized areas, with a zone of bishop pine/Monterey pine hybrids dominating the less heavily podzolized area. Hood Mountain Other examples of California pygmy forests include: * Elfin Forest Natural Area - El Moro Elfin Forest ‚Äî 90 acre State Nature Reserve of 'pygmy oaks' (coast live oak, Quercus agrifolia). Located on the southeastern shore of Morro Bay, in Los Osos of coastal San Luis Obispo County. A raised wooden boardwalk loops through and around the forest, with viewing platforms. * Cuesta Ridge Elfin Forest ‚Äî in the Cuesta Ridge Botanical Special Interest Area, on western Cuesta Ridge of the Santa Lucia Range, in San Luis Obispo County. A pygmy sargent cypress (Cupressus sargentii) forest, where serpentine soil stunts growth. Protected within the 1,334 acre Cuesta Ridge Botanical Special Interest Area, in the Santa Lucia Ranger District of the Los Padres National Forest. * Dwarf Cupressus Preserve ‚Äî a second West Cuesta Ridge grove of the pygmy cypress forest (C. sargentii), managed by the Land Conservancy of San Luis Obispo County. * Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park ‚Äî select pygmy forest locales in the Santa Cruz Mountains in Santa Cruz County. * Mount Tamalpais dwarf forest ‚Äî a forest of small C. pigmaea trees. The mountain's serpentine soil stunts the growth of these trees, causing them to grow only a few feet tall. On Old Stage Road, 0.5 miles northeast of the Bootjack Picnic Area. * San Geronimo Ridge ‚Äî just south of Whites Hill in Marin County. * Hood Mountain ‚Äî near Santa Rosa in Sonoma County. A pygmy cypress forest dominated by C. sargentii and Arctostaphylos species can be found on the northwest slopes. Other types Dartmoor Forest in Wistman's Wood, southwest England Dwarf forests may occur over various world locations, with different origins. On the British west coast, notable occurrences include Wistman's Wood in Devon and isolated patches in the Ross of Mull on the Isle of Mull in Scotland. Stunted tree growth can also occur in some cases of highly alkaline soils such as the Stora Alvaret (Great Alvar) formation on the island of √ñland in Sweden. In that area there are certain extents of pygmy tree growth and also areas devoid of trees entirely with many associations of rare species, due to the unique soil chemistry. In New Jersey, the 3,830-acre (15 km¬≤) West Pine Plains Natural Area within the Bass River State Forest preserves a pygmy forest, consisting of pitch pine and blackjack oak trees that reach a height of as little as four feet at maturity. The ground cover includes bearberry and teaberry sub-shrubs, lichens and mosses. While the same species are present in the vast surrounding region of the Pine Barrens, dwarf plant size is attributed to drier, nutrient-poor soil, exposure to winds, and frequent wildfires in the area.  Conservation  In the high-altitude Antilles elfin forests reduced solar radiation and low evapotranspiration rates means these mountain regions retain moisture. Environmental degradation may affect this. Elfin forests in California serve important roles in regulating stream flow, preventing soil erosion, and preventing evaporation by shading the ground. Clear cutting for agricultural and economic development, amongst other things, may disrupt this.

The song is an up-tempo number, in which Faniello tells his lover that \\"I love you like a fool\\", despite the fact that their relationship has ostensibly ended. He tells her that \\"I won't give you up, I'll never stop\\" and that he is \\"Waiting for the day when I hear you say/Our love is here to stay\\". The video plays up this angle further, as it features a split-screen story in which Faniello and his former lover going through their day and doing much the same thing at much the same time while coming to the realisation that their relationship should not have ended. They both leave their houses to see each other, only to arrive at each other's now- empty house. Disconsolate, they both sit down and attempt to call each other and receive no answer.

A forward with remarkable ball control, imagination, dribbling skills and feints, Sokolov is regarded as one of the most talented Bulgarian footballers of all time. His father was the great Bulgarian goalkeeper Apostol Sokolov who was known as the first one to leave the goal line like modern keepers and was an inspiration for Lev Yashin. Sokolov spent the majority of his playing career with Levski Sofia, winning two A Group titles and two Bulgarian Cups. At international level, he represented Bulgaria at the 1962 FIFA World Cup. Career =Club career= Sokolov started his career with Spartak Plovdiv (under his father's Apostol Sokolov management). On 1 December 1957, he made his debut against Spartak Pleven to become the A Group's youngest ever player at the age of 15 years, 5 months and 12 days old. In early 1958, Sokolov joined Levski Sofia. He made his debut for the club in a friendly against Chelsea in Sofia on 17 August 1958. Two weeks later, he made his league debut for Levski in a 0‚Äì0 draw against Spartak Varna at the age of 16 years, 2 months and 12 days old. Sokolov spent 11 seasons with Levski, scoring 83 goals in 239 matches in all competitions. On 12 September 1965, he scored the club's first ever goal in the European Cup in a 2‚Äì1 away loss against Djurg√•rdens IF. =International career= Sokolov played a key role in Bulgaria winning the 1959 UEFA European Under-18 Championship on home soil. He scored goal in the team's opening group stage match against the Netherlands. Bulgaria won the match 3‚Äì1. Sokolov also scored against East Germany in the semi-finals. One month later, Sokolov received his first call- up to the senior Bulgaria squad.

There are three main objectives typically fulfilled by fence inserts. One is to provide privacy by converting chain link fencing into an opaque surface. Another is to exploit the fence as a site for signage, often providing low-resolution displays of corporate logos, sports mascots or verbal messages. A third objective of fence inserts is to decorate otherwise plain fencing.Encyclopaedia Britannica - Wire 1957. Vol 23. The origin of fence inserts can be traced back to U.S. patent #507,952, filed by Clarence White of Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1893. The invention consists of \\"marbles or other loose independent filling pieces\\" sized to allow placement within the cells of a wire mesh. The purpose of the invention is described as providing \\"a convenient and economical means of lettering, ornamenting, or filling\\" the wire mesh. Current products on the market include privacy slats that weave through the fence, plastic-shaped cups designed to clip into open cells, and two-part interlocking units which attach together at the crossover of fence wires.Fences and Retaining Walls McElroy, W. 1990.

The story is about Barbadian immigrants in Brooklyn, New York. The book gained further recognition after it was reprinted in 1981 by the Feminist Press.Edwin McDowell, \\"Publishing: Paule Marshall's Success\\", The New York Times, October 30, 1981. Synopsis =Book 1. A Long Day and a Long Night= Ten-year-old Selina Boyce lives in a brownstone in Brooklyn with her Barbadian immigrant family: her mother Silla, father Deighton, and sister Ina. Silla is a strict, no-nonsense woman whose goal is to save enough money to purchase the brownstone they are leasing. Deighton is lackadaisical, impulsive, and he frequently cheats on his wife. His dreams of returning to Barbados and his frivolousness are a source of tension between Silla and him. Deighton inherits a piece of land; Silla wants him to sell it so they can buy the brownstone, but Deighton has fantasies about moving back and building an extravagant house. Suggie Skeete, Miss Mary, and Miss Thompson are a few other characters who appear sporadically; Selina goes to them for companionship and advice. =Book 2. Pastorale= Book 2 opens with a brief description of Deighton and Silla's drawn-out argument over selling the piece of land, and Selina imagining herself as one of the sleeping children who lived in the brownstone before the Boyces. Selina starts to think about womanhood and growing up. She goes to the park with her friend Beryl, where they have an argument about how babies are born: c-section or vaginal birth. Beryl confides to Selina that she has started menstruating. Selina is confused and somewhat repulsed by the idea, as she believes it will never happen to her. In reality, Selina feels left out and confused by puberty. =Book 3. The War= World War II is in progress at the start of the third book; this section spans a few years, beginning when Selina is around eleven and ends when she is fifteen. Book 3 is titled \\"The War\\" partially in reference to the war, but also in reference to the continuing argument between Silla and Deighton about his piece of land. A group of a few other Bajan women visits Silla in her kitchen while she makes Barbadian cuisine to sell. She vents her frustrations about the land, but she comes with a plan that will get it taken care of. Selina overhears, and Silla threatens to punish her if she tells her father. Selina searches for someone she can tell about Silla's plans because she wants to protect her father. Deighton, still jobless, begins to devote his time to studying the trumpet. He believes that music will be his next get-rich-quick scheme. Selina tells him about the conversation Silla had with the other Bajan women and her plans to somehow sell the land, but reassures him that it's probably nothing to worry about. She fights with her sister, feeling ignored and unloved. Ina says that no one will ever like her because of her bold and brash personality. Selina tells Miss Thompson about her fight and her concerns about her mothers plans. Miss Thompson, being a maternal and nurturing person, tries to help by distracting her. She fixes Selina's hair in curls, then Selina heads to her mother's work with the intention of confronting her about her plans to sell the land behind Deighton's back. Silla chastises her for travelling to the part of town by herself at night. Silla reveals that she has successfully sold Deighton's land for nine hundred dollars. Over the course of a year, Silla forged letters to Deighton's sister and granted his sister the power of attorney to sell the land. Deighton seems to be resigned to this fact, and agrees to take out the money the following day. He is gone the entire day, which raises Silla's suspicions. Deighton comes home with an abundance of frivolous and extravagant gifts. Silla mourns the loss of the money that could have gotten them the brownstone. The community attends the wedding of ‚ÄôGatha Steed‚Äôs daughter, which turns out to be an extravagant celebration. Deighton shows up to the reception, but it is clear that everyone know what he‚Äôs done, and he is essentially excommunicated. He severely injures his arm while incorrectly using machinery at a factory job, then begins to follow a cultist religion lead by a man called Father Peace. Deighton he demands to be called \\"Brother Boyce\\", and he renounces his family to be with other followers of Father Peace. Silla calls the authorities to have him deported back to Barbados. The family receives news that Deighton either jumped or fell off the ship that was on its way to Barbados, and he drowned. =Book 4. Selina= Since her father's death, Selina's grief has removes her even further from the community. She attends a party hosted by her childhood friend, Beryl, where Selina learns about the Association. She realizes that her peers are all conforming to their parents‚Äô wishes rather than deciding their futures for themselves. Selina begins college. Silla owns the brownstone, and she works to get rid of Miss Mary and Suggie. Miss Mary passes away, and Silla is able to evict Suggie on the grounds that her promiscuous behavior seems suspiciously like prostitution. Selina loses two of the people she's closest to in a short span. Convinced Silla's doing it on purpose, she becomes even angrier and more reclusive. Miss Thompson reveals to Selina how she got the sore on her leg. It was the result of a racist attack while she was in the South, where a man injured her with a shovel. She also encourages her to attend an Association meeting so she can re-connect with her \\"people\\" and her culture a bit more and stop feeling so alienated. Selina begrudgingly agrees to go, but she tells the group they are money-hungry, narrow-minded, etc. and their concerns are petty compared to what they have to face in the white world. Selina meets Clive, a melancholy artist about ten years her senior. He initially seems to share a lot of Selina's personal values, and they begin a secret relationship. Selina joins her school dance team, discovering she has natural talent and enjoys it. Silla finds out about Clive, but Selina lies and says they are just friends. Silla warns Selina about him, saying that he is not the sort of person she should hang around with. Selina decides to rejoin the Association under the pretense of wanting the scholarship they are offering. She plans to take the money and use it to run away with Clive. Selina dances a sola in a recital and has a racist encounter with one of the other dancer's mother afterwards. Selina goes straight to Clive's, and realizes that he never meant to go away with her. Selina leaves her copy of the key to his apartment and returns home to cry herself to sleep. Selina wins the Association scholarship, but she declines the award. In private, she tells her mother she never stopped seeing Clive and what she had planned to do with the money. Selina plans to leave school and go to Barbados alone. The novel ends with Selina walking alone and tossing one of the silver bangles she has had since she was a baby towards a set of brownstones that are being torn down for a city project.

Callaloo, no. 18, Spring‚ÄìSummer 1983, pp. 57‚Äì67. highlights the opposing ideals of Selina's mother and father, and the effect of their ideas on their daughter Selina. Harris writes: \\"Paule Marshall's Brown Girl, Brownstones presents a clash of cultures not only for the young protagonist Selina Boyce, who is torn between her father's love for Barbados and her mother's desire to succeed to the American Dream, but also for Silla Boyce, who has similar conflicts. This strong, bitter, frustrated, disappointed, loving, vindictive woman, who keeps striving in the face of all disappointments, is perhaps one of the most complex black women characters in contemporary American literature\\".Harris (1983), p. 57. By the end of the novel, however, the author concludes that Silla is unable to change sufficiently to escape her blues: ‚ÄúShe has grown in her knowledge of herself and of the actions of the people with whom she identifies, but she has not grown to the point of accepting the changes which should be dictated by such knowledge. She continues to give up something of her humanity by her refusal to change, and that perfect control of one's destiny, that inability to give oneself up to the release of music or of love, is what insures that her state of the blues will never find an outlet\\".Harris (1983), pp. 66‚Äì7. The tension between the themes of individualism and ethnicity are explored in Martin Japtok's essay \\"Paule Marshall's Brown Girl, Brownstones: Reconciling Ethnicity and Individualism\\",Japtok, Martin. \\"Paule Marshall's Brown Girl, Brownstones: Reconciling Ethnicity and Individualism.\\" African American Review, Summer 1998, vol. 32, no. 2, pp. 305‚Äì315. which concludes: \\"The simultaneous assertion of ethnicity and individualism must thus be accomplished through a constructionist conceptualization of ethnicity that allows one to see ethnic solidarity as an original response to an Old World environment that still has validity in the New World, though maybe not the same urgency. [‚Ä¶] Selina accepts ethnic communalism while pursuing an individualist agenda, creating a new conceptualization of ethnicity in the process\\".Japtok (1998), p. 67.

The essay goes on to explore this complex triple-identity. Jones concludes: \\"Marshall's novel is a radical expression of how the black self, when it exists at the intersections of ethnicity, nationhood, and gender, has its wholeness challenged by alternative and frequently conflicting definitions. Just as the sea in Brown Girl contains contradictory multitudes‚Äîit is the sea of female creativity, diasporic consciousness, and African history, yet also the sea of colonial exploitation, industrial decay, and obliteration of the black past‚ÄîMarshall‚Äôs novel as a whole proposes a sense of selfhood which, like a prism, contains many faces, each one refracting at an acute angle of difference\\".Jones (1999), pp. 604‚Äì5.

Wood Most species of Caesalpinia s.l. have poorly defined growth rings, with isolated vessels arranged in radial multiples. Pitting between vessels is alternate and covered, and fibres are generally not divided by a septum. The axial (i.e., longitudinal) parenchyma varies from a winged shape to confluent, and is irregularly storied (i.e., layered), while the rays (perpendicular to growth rings) are of variable height and generally comprise a single or double cell width. Libidibia in particular has layered longitudinal parenchyma and narrow homocellular (i.e., of uniform type) rays without crystals in the ray cells. Sliced face of pau ferro board Uses Its wood is often used for making fingerboards for electric basses and guitars. It has a similar feel and similar tonal attributes to rosewood, but is harder and has a slightly lighter colour.https://www.commercialforestproducts.com/pau- ferro-rosewood/ The wood may also be used for flooring, fancy furniture, and handgun grips. It is also known by the names morado, palo santo, caviuna, Brazilian ironwood, and Bolivian rosewood, though it is not actually rosewood. In guitar making, pau ferro is mainly used for fingerboards and bridges. Some luthiers also use it for the back and sides of acoustic guitars. The Brazilian guitar company Giannini uses laminated pau ferro in many of their classical guitars.classical giannini guitar Although similar in many ways to rosewood, pau ferro has slightly different qualities: Its colouration ranges from coffee brown to yellow brown and purple. The tonal characteristics are said to be between rosewood and ebony, with a slightly \\"snappier\\" sound, being \\"slightly brighter than rosewood but with the same depth and warmth\\". Fender has utilized pau ferro on many of their instruments in recent years due to the increasing cost of rosewood due to CITES laws. The Stevie Ray Vaughan Signature Fender Stratocaster was one of the company's first instruments to feature a pau ferro fingerboard.  Allergy information  Pau ferro, used as a rosewood substitute, is a strong sensitizer capable of causing acute outbreaks of allergic and irritant dermatitis in workers not previously exposed to it. This, however, has not prevented furniture factories from using the product. Apparently, most workers develop tolerance to the wood.

Publication history He first appeared in Captain America #323 (Nov 1986). Fictional character biography Hector Lennox was born in Houston, Texas. He was a U.S. Army veteran who grew bored during peace-time service. He signed up for the Power Broker's strength augmentation process, and joined the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation. Later, his army friend John Walker, the Super-Patriot, approached him to form a team of superhumans. This new team was known as the B.U.C.s (Bold Urban Commandos) or \\"Buckies\\", and consisted of Lennox, Lemar Hoskins, and Jerome Johnson. The Super-Patriot publicly spoke out against the original Captain America, and the Buckies (who pretended to be Cap's supporters) staged opposition to Walker and pretended to attack him at a rally in Central Park as a publicity stunt. Walker defeated these protesters and proclaimed to Captain America that the people should decide who was worthy of being Captain America.Captain America #323 Left-Winger also participated in an attack on foreign students.Captain America #334 Eventually, the Commission on Superhuman Activities selected Walker to replace Steve Rogers as Captain America, and chose Lemar Hoskins to become his partner Bucky (and later as Battlestar). Lennox and Johnson were left behind, feeling betrayed and angered. They chose the names Left-Winger and Right-Winger respectively. They wore stolen Guardsmen armor and battled Walker and Hoskins. The pair upstaged the new Captain America at a patriotic rally and press conference, attacking him and revealing Walker's identity to the press out of jealousy over his new-found success.Captain America #341 As a result, Walker's parents were killed by the militia group The Watchdogs, nearly driving Walker into a mental breakdown. Walker blamed his former partners for his parents' deaths, and he stalked them. When he caught up to Left-Winger and Right-Winger, he tied them to an oil tank which was detonated by a torch-saber and left them to die.Captain America #347 They barely survived the explosion due to their bodies' enhanced physiology, leaving them terribly burned and in critical condition. Later, Walker became the U.S. Agent and joined the West Coast Avengers. Left-Winger and Right-Winger, alongside several others, were plucked from different time periods by Immortus to serve in the third Legion of the Unliving. They battled U.S. Agent, who slew them again not believing them to be authentic.West Coast Avengers #61 Eventually, it was revealed to Walker that the pair had survived the explosion and were hospitalized in Houston. After undergoing painful treatment for the burns they received, they had committed suicide. When Walker learned of this, he was remorseful.Captain America #383 Powers and abilities As a result of augmentation of his physical attributes by Dr. Karl Malus on behalf of the Power Broker, Left-Winger has superhuman strength, stamina, reflexes & reactions, and endurance. Left-Winger carries a torch- sabre which would ignite at the touch of a button and projected a foot-long fiery \\"blade\\" as hot as a blowtorch. It can burn through thick steel within seconds. Left-Winger had moderate street-fighting experience, basic army training, and rigorous wrestling training.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. History Female prisoner at the Surrey House of Correction in the 1860s The prison was originally built in 1820 and opened as the Surrey House of Correction, Brixton Prison was intended to house 175 prisoners. However, regularly exceeding its capacity supporting over 200 prisoners, overcrowding was an early problem and with its small cells and poor living conditions contributed to its reputation as one of the worst prisons in London (worsened when Brixton became one of the first prisons to introduce treadwheels in 1821). There is an illustration of prisoners on the 1821 treadmill used to mill corn in Surrey House of Correction. Conditions for women were especially harsh as newly arrived female inmates were made to spend four months in solitary confinement and, following their introduction into the general prison population, would be required to maintain a condition of silent association. Female inmates were allowed over time to earn privileges, which included limited conversation, payment for labor, the right to receive letters and visitation rights. Eventually the problem of overcrowding was addressed with the prison expanding to house over 800 prisoners and, in 1852, the British government converted Brixton into a women's correctional facility after Van Diemen's Land (modern day Tasmania) became the final colony to refuse to accept women prisoners from England, under the penal transportation process. Brixton Women's Prison in 1862 Conditions in the prison gradually improved during the mid-19th century as a nursery was opened in the prison for children under the age of four and, by 1860, inmates were allowed to keep their children until the end of their prison sentence. Brixton eventually became a military prison from 1882 until 1898 and remained a trial-and-remand prison for London and the Home Counties until 2012. The footings for the treadmill remain and are visible and the former 'hanging i.e. execution suite' is now an enlarged cell with six beds. On 7 July 1991 two Provisional IRA prisoners, Pearse McAuley and Nessan Quinlivan, escaped from the prison by subduing a guard. They managed to scale the walls, hijack the car of a passing member of the public before reaching the Baker Street Underground station. They managed to flee to the Republic of Ireland. =Recent history= In October 1999, Prisons Minister, Paul Boateng had to make an emergency visit to Brixton Prison after a spate of multiple suicide attempts by inmates being held in the medical wards of the jail. The minister subsequently promised more nurses and staff for the prison's healthcare unit. A month later, Boateng threatened to privatise Brixton Prison if improvements were not made by management to the regime and conditions at the jail. In the spring of 2000 a surprise inspection by HM Inspectorate of Prisons resulted in the Director of the Prison Service being summoned to see the appalling conditions in which prisoners with mental health issues were being kept. The Governor was removed the same day, only to be reappointed to run HM Prison Downview a few weeks later. It was also noted that cell call buzzers had been sabotaged by Prison Officers so as not to be disturbed during their shifts, only a small light remaining operational to indicate activation of a cell emergency call. In August 2000, prison officers from all over the UK staged an illegal strike after the government released proposals confirming intentions to privatise Brixton Prison. The privatisation plans were subsequently dropped, and Brixton Prison has remained in the public sector. In January 2001, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons severely criticised conditions at Brixton Prison. The report claimed that staff had falsified records and tried to sabotage the inspection. Standards of healthcare and race relations within the prison were also criticised. In June 2004, a further inspection report praised Brixton Prison for improving standards. The report highlighted the prisons good staff-prisoner relations and improved support for new prisoners. However, inspectors highlighted overcrowding as a major issue that was hampering further improvements at the jail. Another inspection report in July 2006 stated that poor facilities were holding back improvements being made to Brixton Prison. The prison's kitchens, healthcare and sports facilities were highlighted as being particularly inadequate. In October 2008, the Chief Inspector of Prisons warned that many inmates held at Brixton Prison were taking drugs, and this was leading to violent attacks amongst gangs at the prison. The inspector also claimed that the prison was infested with vermin. A further inspection was carried out in 2014. The report stated that conditions had improved although there were still concerns regarding levels of violence, incidents of self-harm, overcrowding and offender management. The prison today A radio interview recording in HMP Brixton HMP Brixton no longer acts as a local prison, having been changed to a Category C training establishment in 2012. Accommodation at Brixton comprises four main residential units, plus a health care unit. A new Kitchen has been built and plans are in discussion to replace the Reception, Healthcare, & Sports complex. Inmates can pursue a range of education courses at the Learning and Skills centre. These courses include Information Technology, English, Maths, Social and Life Skills and a varied art programme. Most courses lead to nationally recognised qualifications. The gym also offers Physical Education and accredited programmes. The Windmill Centre is a traditional workshop located where the old kitchens were. The Family and Visitor's Centre at Brixton is run by the Prison Advice & Care Trust (pact), an independent charity. HMP Brixton is no longer the remand prison for Southwark Crown Court. This is now the job of HMP Wandsworth. Nor does it temporarily lodge prisoners appearing at the Court of Appeal Criminal Division (COACD) held at the Royal Courts of Justice (RCJ). That is now done at HMP Pentonville. HMP Brixton was the setting of Gordon Ramsay's 2012 British television series Gordon Behind Bars, where he teaches a brigade of 12 inmates to cook, cater and after the first four weeks give back to society by selling on the produce.

Legacy costs are those incurred by an organization (whether corporation or city) in prior years under different leadership or when the entity's priorities and resources were different. While it can refer to other commitments (particularly existing infrastructure) as well, it primarily refers to obligations to pay health care costs and pensions under defined- benefit plans for current employees and retirees, usually incurred during the labor peace era after World War II. Legacy costs are believed to hinder American jobs, such as auto manufacturers and central cities, and older airlines worldwide. This belief leads to the idea that legacy costs will lower the company's competitiveness. Organized labor sees such criticisms as part of a desire to abandon any form of social contract between worker and employer. Newer, less-established entities have few or no problems with legacy costs, because they have less pension and health care liabilities (this applies to new suburbs, for example, as well as new companies), and are therefore able to out-compete (in some cases) the older entities. History In the 1990s, steel firms were guaranteed pension funds. Workers had health-care benefits through these steel firms; however, there was an issue in funding for the defined benefit pension funds. In 1986, PBGC took over LTV's pension payments after LTV went bankrupt. The main apprehension was the liabilities between the firms with defined benefit plans and the firms with contribution pension plans. After this problem, many workers believed that the old firms had to pay the costs of the pensions, also known as legacy costs. The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy has conducted research on how much money is spent on pension plans from state and local government in their published 2012 findings. This research used records from Boston College Center for Retirement Research with a Public Plans Database (PPD). The information needed to be counted for the calculation are age and salary histories of members, retirement ages, asset earnings, etc. From this article's database, researchers came to the conclusion that pensions are underfunded because governments do not plan enough funds to insure liabilities expenses in that year.

Most of the land between Pullenvale Road and the river () is the University of Queensland's Pinjarra Hills campus. The campus is a research facility. Apart from the university camps, the suburb is rural residential. Moggill Road is the main road route through the suburb. History The suburb was named after Pinjarra Road which travels through the suburb. However, the origin of the road name is unknown. In the 1860s Patrick Mayne purchased the land now owned by the University of Queensland. Following the death of Patrick Mayne, it was inherited by his son William. In 1922 William's death resulted in his siblings Dr James O'Neil Mayne and his sister Miss Mary Emelia Mayne inheriting the land. In 1923 the Mayne siblings gave the land to the University of Queensland to enhance the teaching of agriculture. It was known as the Moggill Farm. However, circa 2000 when the university began to plan the relocation of its agriculture and veterinary disciplines to its new Gatton campus which had its own farm, the role of the Moggill Road became unclear. Rumours circulated that the university tended to sell the land for housing which attracted considerable protest.

History There are a number of theories about the original of the name Pullenvale. One theory from a 1920s newspaper is that it is named after early timbergetter, George Pullen; however, no land records have been found to confirm this. Given that the local creek is known as Pullen Pullen Creek, some people believe the repetition suggests a word from one of the Australian Aboriginal languages possibly meaning \\"to die\\" (or \\"not to die\\") or \\"fighting\\" (or \\"fighting ground\\"). Another theory is that the Pullen Pullen name was originally Bullen Bullen, an Aboriginal word meaning \\"lonely place\\". In support of the \\"fighting\\" theory, there is an 1850 newspaper account: There is evidence that there was a Mr Pullen who had a vineyard at Pullevale from about the 1862 to at least 1885.

The median age of the Pullenvale population was 39 years, 2 years above the Australian median. 68.2% of people living in Pullenvale were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were England 10.3%, South Africa 4.6%, New Zealand 2.4%, United States of America 1.4%, Scotland 1.1%. 91.2% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 1.1% Afrikaans, 0.7% German, 0.6% Japanese, 0.5% Mandarin, 0.4% Cantonese.  Landmarks  Pullenvale Hall, located at 302 Grandview Road, Pullenvale, is an old pineapple packing shed. The Hall was purchased from resident Jack Woodward in about 1943. It is the centre of many small functions and classes run by the residents of Pullenvale in cooperation with the Local Council.  School  Pullenvale State School is located on Grandview Road and opened on 16 March 1874. It was noted in the Brisbane Courier of 28 June 1873 that the residents of Pullenvale had, \\"fairly earned the reputation of being possessed of considerable pluck, having lately accomplished a task of which many older settlements might well be proud that of placing in the Savings Bank the sum of ¬£60 to the oredit of the Board of Education for the purpose of erecting a National School Fix this textfor the benefit of the young Pullenites.\\" A year later it was reported in The Queenslander that there was now, \\"a fine school and teacher's residence, and an average daily attendance of thirty children (which by the way might be increased by a little salutary compulsion).\\" in 2014 the school recorded 387 students and in 2015 the school was granted Independent Public School status. Sporting clubs Moggill Pony Club Inc. was formed in 1960. The land located at, 41 O'Brien Road, Pullenvale, is owned by the Pony Club.Moggill Pony Club Inc.. Retrieved 18 September 2010 The Pony Club is one of the oldest pony clubs in Queensland and covers four hectares of land.  Development  Pioneer Pullenvale residents developed a logging industry. The construction of Moggill Road, linking Brisbane with Ipswich via Moggill, made the area more accessible. Eventually the logging industry give way to small crop and dairy farming. The resulting tiny population of farming families led to the establishment of the Pullenvale State School in 1873. For the next 100 years or so the rural population remained steady, it was not until 1981 that the State School was rebuilt to cater for a great increase in population that stemmed from the encroaching Brisbane metropolis.

It was generally believed to have been one of the earliest Japanese histories until the middle of the Edo period, when scholars such as Tokugawa Mitsukuni successfully contended that it was an imitation based on the Nihon Shoki, the Kojiki and the Kogo Sh≈´i.Encyclopedia of Shinto entry by Masafumi Motosawa, 2007. Kokugakuin University. Accessed 2013-6-19. Scholarship on the Kujiki generally considers it to contain some genuine elements, specifically that Book 5 preserves traditions of the Mononobe and Owari clans, and that Book 10 preserves the earlier historical record the Kokuz≈ç Hongi. Ten volumes in length, it covers the history of ancient Japan through Empress Suiko, third daughter of Emperor Kinmei. The preface is supposedly written by Soga no Umako (+626). While it includes many quotes from Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), volumes five and ten contain unique materials. The overall composition is considered as having been compiled between 807 and 936. The Kujiki contains 10 volumes, but there are 3 false documents also called Kujiki, produced in the Edo period: the 30 volumes Shirakawa edition, Shirakawahon Kujiki (ÁôΩÊ≤≥Êú¨Êóß‰∫ãÁ¥Ä) (kept by the Shirakawa Hakuou family), the 72 volumes Enp≈ç edition, Enp≈çhon Sendai Kuji Hongi Taiseiky≈ç (Âª∂ÂÆùÊú¨ÂÖà‰ª£Êóß‰∫ãÊú¨Á¥ÄÂ§ßÊàêÁµå) (discovered in 1679), and the 31 volumes Sazaki succession edition, Sazaki Denhon Sendai Kuji Hongi Taiseiky≈ç (È∑¶È∑Ø‰ºùÊú¨ÂÖà‰ª£Êóß‰∫ãÊú¨Á¥ÄÂ§ßÊàêÁµå). The only complete English translation of the Kujiki was made in 2006 by John R. Bentley, who argued based on his examinations of extant manuscripts that the Kujiki was indeed written in the early eighth century CE, before the Kogo Sh≈´i, and as part of the same historiographical movement that produced the Nihon Shoki and the Kojiki. Bentley took the preface, which attributes the work to the early-7th century statesman Prince Sh≈çtoku, to be a later interpolation. In a review for Monumenta Nipponica, Mark Teeuwen criticized Bentley's methodology.Mark Teeuwen, ‚ÄúSendai Kuji Hongi: Authentic Myths or Forged History?‚Äù, Monumenta Nipponica 62.1 (2007), 87-96 Notes References * * =Further reading= * John R.

The series follows Utena Tenjou, a tomboy high school student who is drawn into a series of sword duels to win the hand of Anthy Himemiya, a mysterious student known as the \\"Rose Bride\\". Main characters ; : :Utena is a tomboyish, courageous and na√Øve character who lives to emulate the idealized prince figure from her childhood. She is forthright, honest and friendly. Nearly all the girls in school adore her. She both subverts and conforms to the stereotypes she embodies as a noble warrior and a na√Øve magical girl in danger of becoming a damsel in distress. The series chronicles her journey to protect her friend Anthy and become a truly noble Prince. Utena's relationship with Anthy, going from close friends to family to blooming into love, is one of the most important themes in the series; both Utena and Anthy were confirmed to be in love by director Kunihiko Ikuhara. In the manga, Utena's relationship with Anthy is only that of friendship and it's hinted she has feelings for Touga. In the movie, Utena went to Ohtori to find Touga after the two apparently broke up. She mistakenly believes Anthy is the cause for the breakup, but soon forms a relationship with Anthy. Their relationship becomes more sexually-tinged compared to the TV series. The characters are seen kissing both in the TV show credits and the movie. Her Dueling Rose is white. ; : :A mysterious, shy girl whose distant expression and superficial politeness mask a complex, darker personality. It is said that she has no thoughts or desires of her own; she will do anything her master expects of her. Because of her \\"doormat\\" behavior, other characters tend to project their wants or desires onto her, and she is always the target of their eventual rage. Her past and current personality are simultaneously tragic and sinister, and her personality shifts between selfless love, passive-aggressiveness, cruelty and learned helplessness. Like Utena, Anthy also subverts and conforms to the stereotypes she embodies as both a damsel in distress and a witch. Near the end of the series she betrays Utena and stabs her with the sword of Dios as she cannot accept a prince that is a girl. When, despite this, Utena tries to save Anthy and takes the Swords of Hatred in her place, Anthy in a way has been revolutionized by Utena and is no longer in controlled by Akio nor is she longer the Rose Bride. She leaves the school to find Utena. In the movie, Anthy's role as the Rose Bride is more explicit as it's shown she will have sex with whomever is the current champion. In the movie, Anthy is portrayed as much less manipulative and more open. ; : :Anthy's mysterious older brother, the acting chairman of the academy, and the primary antagonist of the series. In the anime, Akio was a prince named Dios in his previous life, and it is in this guise that he meets with Utena, inspiring her to become a prince. He conspires to regain his power by taking Utena's sword, exploiting Anthy as a wedge through their incestuous and power- driven relationship. He is ultimately thwarted by Utena's sacrifice; Anthy finds the courage to finally leave him and Ohtori Academy behind, and his fate from this point on is unknown. In the manga, Akio and Dios are gods, the former having killed the latter in order to gain his power. In the film, Dios is the lord of the flies rendered in human form by Anthy's magic; Akio is dead, having thrown himself out of a window after realizing Anthy was lucid when he drugged and raped her. :Akio's given name is derived from the Japanese name for Venus the , which is identified with Lucifer. Student Council ; : :President of the Student Council and Ohtori's resident playboy, Touga is an arrogant and handsome young man whose desire to be powerful drives him to cruel, unscrupulous deeds and whose manipulative abilities are second only to Akio. He is the only regular Council Member who deliberately involves himself in Akio's plans. Despite his talent and intelligence, Touga eventually realizes that he's not as influential as Akio, and this causes him to change his ways as he tries to discover a new method to gain power. In the manga his sexual behavior is downplayed and he becomes a servant to Utena in order to help her as well as get close to her. In the movie, he used to be Utena's boyfriend but something happened that caused them to drift apart. In the movie, instead of Dios, Touga is the main motivation for Utena to go to Ohtori. He is gentle and noble but it is shown in a flashback that he was raped by his adopted father, which is positioned as an explanation for his loose sexual morals. An episode was planned that focused on this aspect of Touga's past in the TV series, but due to Takehito Koyasu's absence this plot point never came to be. His Dueling Rose is red. ; : :Vice-president of the Student Council and captain of the kendo team. Kyouichi is temperamental, egotistical, prone to angry rages, and often cruel. Kyouichi's lack of self- control stems from insecurity, a lifelong rivalry against Touga from which he is always at the losing end, and the fear that everyone and everything he knows will eventually die. He is obsessed with Anthy because he views the Rose Bride as a mindless doll who will never disobey him, and thus be with him forever. His Dueling Rose is green. ; : :Miki is an ingenuous and polite seventh grader who befriends Utena, despite their role as possible opponents in the duels. He is especially known for his skill with the piano. In spite (or because of) his genius, he is lonely, sheltered and insecure, and seeks a person who is just as pure and talented as him. With the exception of their two duels, Miki is mostly a friend to Utena. In the anime he has a crush on Anthy, whereas in the manga he has a crush on Utena. His Dueling Rose is light blue. ; : :The captain of the academy's fencing team, Juri is one of Ohtori's most highly respected students, and even the teachers appear to be in awe of her. Her aloof, intimidating manner hides her secret love for her childhood friend, Shiori. Of the Student Council Duelists, she is thought to be the most noble, and thus the one with the most potential to become a Prince, but her nobility and the strength that comes with it are constantly undermined by her desires and despair. In the manga she is deeply in love with Touga and hates Utena for being a rival to his heart. Production materials indicate that she is depicted as straight in the manga based on limitations pushed on Chiho Saito. Her Dueling Rose is orange. ; : :Touga's dramatic younger sister, often used as comic relief throughout the series. Her love for her brother borders on obsession and incest, and she is often seen using devious means to punish the people who take Touga's attentions away from her. Despite this, she displays a certain childish innocence in her desires, that is distinctly at odds with Akio and Anthy's relationship. Though her motivations are considered the least ambitious out of all the Duelists, they are no less real to her, and she suffers just as much as all the other Student Council members throughout the series, being a constant victim of her brother's manipulations. She is only shown in a photo in the manga and has no role in the movie, but is briefly shown as a cow, referring to one of the \\"gag\\" episodes of the series where Nanami turns into a cow. Her Dueling Rose is yellow. ; : : A master swordsman, Ruka is the former captain of the fencing team and a former member of the Student Council. His cunning, manipulative behavior belies a hidden desperation to live and help the one he loves, and his influence on Juri becomes one of the major turning points for her character. His Dueling Rose is dark blue. Black Rose Duelists ; : :Souji is the pink-haired head of the popular Mikage Seminar at Ohtori Academy. He wishes to kill Anthy and install a gravely ill boy, Mamiya Chida, as the Rose Bride in order to save him from terminal illness. Mikage uses manipulation and psychology to control students close to the Council members in order to create a Duelist who can beat Utena. ; : :Akio's fianc√©e, daughter of the school's Trustee Chairman. She has a strained relationship with Anthy, who she finds \\"creepy and intolerable\\", and considers Anthy an obstacle to her relationship with Akio. Though she loves Akio very much, she feels distant from him and becomes the first Black Rose Duelist. It is implied that, after her defeat, Akio poisons her since he never actually loved her and used their relationship simply to keep his status as interim chairman of the school. ; : :Miki's twin sister, Kozue feels overshadowed by her brother's talents and reacts by sleeping with many different men. She's extremely possessive of Miki to the point where she physically hurts anyone who tries to hurt or \\"steal\\" him. In the manga, Kozue's brother complex is purely innocent and she acts more like Nanami does in the TV series. In the movie, Kozue is in an implied incestuous relationship with her brother but Miki is shown breaking it up. Later on, Kozue is shown as a car implying she is either also helping Miki to escape Ohtori or simply helping Utena and Anthy. ; : :Shiori is the catalyst for Juri's current broken state of mind. She simultaneously idolizes Juri for her brilliance and feels envious of her for it. Her extreme lack of self-worth is the reason for the rocky relationship between the two, and it reaches a breaking point when Ruka re-enters Ohtori Academy. According to Kunihiko Ikuhara, Shiori was ironically also in love with Juri the entire time but she believes Juri's affection towards her was out of pity, not love. She thus wants to remain in control of their relationship by never confessing to Juri so she will be the winner of their rivalry. In the movie, she is the main antagonist who manipulates Juri's feelings for her so Juri can duel with Utena, with her ultimate goal being to use Juri to escape the school. The film version of Shiori lacks the self- esteem problems of her TV counterpart, and instead is a hateful narcissist who believes that she is the only one worthy of leaving the school and entering the world of adulthood, and will use anyone or anything to get there. In the end of the film, Shiori makes a mad dash (in car form) to escape the school once Utena and Anthy earn the right to leave. However, she ends up crashing and exploding as she tries to push them off the road, presumably killing her. ; : :Nanami's most devoted lackey, a boy in fourth grade. Mitsuru is obsessed with serving Nanami and wishes to be her adored \\"brother\\". He is extremely confused about love, sex and adulthood in general. Mitsuru's fruitless attempts to experiment makes him a Black Rose Duelist. ; : :Wakaba is the most outwardly cheerful person in the series and is Utena's best friend, but she feels surrounded by \\"special\\" people and doesn't know how to become special herself. Thus, she develops an obsession with creating situations where \\"special\\" people (namely Utena and Saionji) must rely on her in some way, which allows her to feel special by virtue of these \\"special\\" people being dependent on her. Wakaba sees herself as a perfectly average person and is only happy when she takes care of people because she does not feel like she has any other talents. Wakaba does not realize the importance of her role in the story ‚Äî her crush on Kyouichi Saionji and his rejection caused Utena to become involved in the duels in the first place, and her empathy and passion rescued Utena from a slump after the first Touga duel. She ends up becoming a Black Rose Duelist, having been twisted by her hatred for Anthy and envy towards Utena, as well as her blind desperation to keep Saionji from returning to school and leaving her. ; : :Keiko is one of Nanami's sidekicks who follows her only because she has a crush on Touga. Her jealousy, though as simple as Nanami's, is strong enough for Souji to take advantage of her mind. : Miscellaneous characters ; :Girl A. :Girl B. :Girl C. :A mysterious theater troupe that follows the adventures of Utena and company in the anime series. They appear in nearly every episode at some point to explain the episode's theme in the form of an allegorical shadow play. Initially, the relationship between these characters (who are only shown as silhouettes) and the main characters in the series is uncertain, as they are not seen interacting with each other or even in the same frame. As such, they assume the role of a Greek chorus that only the audience can perceive. As the series progresses, however, the Shadow Players gradually interact more and more with the other characters, occasionally putting on plays behind the other characters, and it's hinted that the other characters are partially aware of the shadows' presences and their plays. They also put on a radio show that Akio calls into in one episode. At the beginning of the Apocalypse arc, they appear in person to invite Utena to one of their plays. The players have no names but do have distinct hairstyles and roles, and are referred to as , , and respectively.

The Star Pavilion The Star Pavilion at Hersheypark Stadium is located at the north end of Hersheypark Stadium (see above). It only hosts small concerts (up to 7,500) on both reserved seating and General Admission (on the Grass/Hill). Hersheypark Arena Hersheypark Arena is one of the oldest standing ice rinks left standing in the United States today. Built in 1939 for the Hershey Bears hockey team, it has aged over the years and forced the company to build the Giant Center at the other end (west end) of the complex. The arena used to host ice hockey games, the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus, WWE Wrestling and small concerts (seating capacity is about 7,000.) Today it is used for local hockey team practice, as a small concert venue, for youth hockey games, public skating, and as a meeting place for companies. This was where Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in a single NBA game. Giant Center The Giant Center, located at 950 W. Hersheypark Drive, is the premier enclosed arena in central Pennsylvania. Built in 2002 as a replacement for the historic Hersheypark Arena, which was aging rapidly and did not have a large enough capacity for events, the GIANT Center is the largest arena in South Central Pennsylvania. The GIANT Center is owned by The Township of Derry. Emergency Preparedness In March 2008 the Hershey Entertainment Complex was certified as StormReady by the National Weather Service. This is awarded to communities and organizations/compaines that are prepared for Severe Weather.

He makes his living as a freelance writer and artist, accepting assignments involving screenplays, storyboards, character design, backgrounds, website graphics, and some the magazine covers, portraits or commissioned work. Penders illustrated the cover of the complete series DVD set of Sonic the Hedgehog. Career Penders is known for his work on the comic series Sonic the Hedgehog, which was published by Archie Comics. He primarily worked on the former side-series Knuckles the Echidna before it was cancelled due to poor sales in 1999, though he continued to produce stories and artwork for the main title until 2006. In addition to his work for Archie Comics, Penders has written and illustrated stories for other comic publishers including DC, Marvel, Image and Disney on titles as Star Trek: The Next Generation, Disney Adventures, Savage Sword of Conan, Captain Atom, and The Green Hornet among many others. He also branched out into other media, producing children's activity books and creating graphics for CD-ROM games. In December 2011, Penders announced plans to utilize Echidna characters he created for the Archie comics in a graphic novel series entitled The Lara-Su Chronicles. Said series is planned to feature Lara-Su, one of his original characters created during his work at Archie, as its protagonist. On March 5, 2014, Penders announced on his Twitter account that his characters were no longer echidna but Echyd'nya, an alien species. Penders stated reasons for the change was that he needed to make some adjustments to broaden the audience while making certain longtime fans get answers and resolution and because of the difficulty he has seen with people pronouncing the word echidna. Lawsuits =Archie Comics vs Penders = In January 2009, Penders began copyrighting various stories, characters, and artwork that he created for Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog comic series and spin-off titles, and these claims were certified as of April 2010 by the US Copyright Office. After declaring that he would \\"use every legal means at my disposal to protect and preserve\\" his works, Archie Comics filed a lawsuit against Penders in the fall of 2010 in an attempt to retain their copyright holdings of his characters and concepts. In the fall of 2012, Archie Comics fired its legal team and replaced it. Following this and a court settlement, many characters created by Penders were retconned, never to appear in the comics again. = Penders vs SEGA and EA = Penders filed a lawsuit against Sega and Electronic Arts (EA Games) in 2011 for alleged copyright infringement in the game Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood, which was developed by EA's subsidiary BioWare. The case was dismissed without prejudice September 26, 2011, then again in February 2012, after the case had been refiled four days after it was originally dismissed, despite warnings from Judge Otis Wright who dismissed the case both times.

There are also bachelor's, associate, and certificate programs in library science, which provide formal training of paraprofessional library workers, library technicians, and clerks‚Äîas well as preparation for graduate study in library science. Historical development Until the 19th century, the librarian in charge of an academic collection was normally a scholar, often a university professor with a special interest in the library. There were no training programs, and the new librarian was expected to follow the practices of other similar libraries. (Popular libraries in the modern sense had not yet developed.) In the 19th century, although some librarians followed this older pattern, others prepared as apprentices under the direction of established librarians. Library school A library school is an institution of higher learning specializing in the professional training of librarians. The first library school in the United States was established by Melvil Dewey (the originator of the Dewey decimal system) in 1887 at Columbia University.Eberhart, M. (2016). \\"Things you didn't know about ALA history, 1876-1900.\\" Retrieved from https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/blogs/the-scoop/things-you-didnt-know- about-ala-history-1876-1900/; Yates, M. (1997). \\"A Capital Asset The History and Resources of the New York State Library.\\" Retrieved from http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/library/otherpubs/capasset.htm. Since then many library schools have been founded in the United States and Canada,Churchwell, Charles D. 1975. The shaping of American library education. Chicago: American Library Association. with Canada's first formal librarianship program established at McGill University in 1904. The development of library schools in other countries began in 1915, when librarians' schools were founded at Leipzig and Barcelona (currently, as a faculty of the Universitat de Barcelona, the latter is the oldest library school in Europe). Many others were founded during World War II. The University of Chicago Graduate Library School became the first library school to confer a master's degree in library science, which is now the standard professional degree, and later became the first to give a doctoral degree in the field. Other prominent American library schools are located at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Most library schools in North America offer graduate programs only. Accreditation of these programs is granted by the American Library Association. The bachelor's degree in Library Science (or Library Economy as it was called in early days) was, for the most part, phased out several decades ago.White, Carl Milton. 1976. A historical introduction to library education: problems and progress to 1951. Metuchen, N.J.: Scarecrow Press. Librarians in North America typically earn a master's degree, typically the Master of Library Science (MLS) or the Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS). This degree allows one to work as a practicing librarian in public libraries, academic libraries, school library media centers, and special libraries, while many individuals with the MLS credential work with major library vendors. The degree is also applicable to related sectors such as publishing. Master of Library Science programs are typically structured to offer a combination of required and elective courses in library science and information science. The required courses focus on core library skills such as cataloging, reference, collection development as well as related areas such as the philosophy underlying the profession, information technology and management. Elective courses may include information management, children's literature, genealogy and archives as well as specialized courses related to different types of libraries. In recent decades, many schools offering librarianship education have changed their names to reflect the shift from print media to electronic media, and to information contained outside of traditional libraries. Some call themselves schools of library and information science (abbreviated to \\"SLIS\\", hence the term \\"SLISters\\" for their students), while others may have dropped the word \\"library\\" altogether. This trend began as early as the 1960s with the recognition that information and access to it was shifting to electronic resources with the development of telecommunications and computer networks and away from the traditional definition of librarianship. This shift led a number of library schools to change or broaden their mission to be more inclusive of information sciences across many disciplines including library sciences, archives, computer sciences and more, and led to the development by a number of schools of an iSchool organization,Olson, G., & Grudin, J. (2009, March 1). The information school phenomenon. Interactions: New Visions of Human-Computer Interaction, 15-19. to advance the field of information as a whole. Degree programs The normal preparation for a faculty member in a department of library science (or other name) is a Ph.D. in Library science or Information science. In some fields of librarianship, a Ph.D. in another related subject, such as archival studies, is the equivalent, and some faculty have doctorates in various subject fields, as well as an MLS (or similar) degree. =United States and Canada= In the United States and Canada, a professional librarian normally has a one or two-year master's degree in library and information science, library science or information science with abbreviations such as MLS, MSLS, MIS, MS-LIS, MISt, MI, MLIS, or MILS. Many professional librarians have degrees obtained from programs accredited by the American Library Association (ALA) and can have specializations within fields such as archives, records management, information architecture, information policy, knowledge management, public librarianship, medical librarianship, law librarianship, special librarianship, academic librarianship, or school (K-12) librarianship. School librarians often are required to have a teaching credential and school librarian license in addition to a library science degree. Master's degree programs for school library media specialist initial preparation are also accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), which ALA recognizes. Many, if not most, academic librarians also have a second, subject-based master's degree. The early history of education for librarians in the U.S. has been explored by Churchwell.Churchwell, Charles D. 1975. The shaping of American library education. Chicago: American Library Association. The University of Chicago studies in library science assessed the state of education for librarians in 1948.Berelson, Bernard. 1949. Education for librarianship; papers presented at the Library Conference, University of Chicago, August 16‚Äì21, 1948. Chicago: American Library Association. The pivotal role of the first doctoral degree at the University of Chicago Graduate Library School from 1921-1951 has been analyzed by John Richardson in his study, The Spirit of Inquiry.Richardson, John V. 1982. The spirit of inquiry: the Graduate Library School at Chicago, 1921-51. Chicago: American Library Association. Many faculty members at the University of Chicago, Graduate Library School (1928-1979) were at the forefront of the field's development in the twentieth century: Lester Asheim, Lee Pierce Butler, Leon Carnovsky, Herman H. Fussler, Frances E. Henne, Carleton B. Joeckel, Jesse Shera, Peggy Sullivan, Douglas Waples, Louis Round Wilson, Howard Winger, and Robert Wadsworth. The Library Quarterly was first published by the Graduate Library School in 1931. At the turn of the millennium (1999‚Äì2000), problems related to the graduate education of professional librarians pervaded professional and academic discourse. These were initially identified by the Council of the American Library Association as the growing elimination of the word \\"library\\" from the names of schools, the seeming lack of attention to core competencies (cataloguing was often mentioned), and the national shortage of professionals to work with particular groups (specifically young people in public libraries and disadvantaged populations), and in particular environments (such as schools). The Final Report of the Steering Committee on the Congress for Professional Education provides an analysis of these issues. The Coalition on Reinventing Information Science, Technology, and Literary Education supported by the Kellogg Foundation provided additional analysis of future educational needs and direction.Drabenstott, K. M., et al., The Kellogg CRISTAL-ED Project: creating a model program to support libraries in the digital age {Coalition on Reinventing Information Science, Technology, and Literary Education}.

Scarecrow Press The first award was made in 1954 to Rudolph Hjalmar Gjelsness Dean of the University of Michigan's Library Science Department from 1940 to 1964. The primary association for faculty teaching in library and information science programs is the Association for Library and Information Science Education. In academic regalia in the United States, the color for library science is lemon. =Europe= In the UK, a librarian can have a three- or four-year bachelor's degree in library and information studies or information science; separate master's degrees in librarianship, archive management, and records management are also available. In the United Kingdom, these degrees are accredited by the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals and the Society of Archivists. In Germany, the first step for an academic librarian is a Ph.D. in a subject field, followed by additional training in librarianship. In Denmark the first step to become a librarian is a 3-year long bachelor's degree in Library and Information Science (B.Sc.) at The Royal School of Library and Information Science. The students then have the choice between taking a half-year-long education for librarianship called Librarian D.B or take a 2-year master's degree called Master of Library and Information Science (M.L.I.Sc.). All the already mentioned courses takes place in Danish but The Royal School of Library and Information Science also offers an English- speaking 2-year master's degree called Master of Library and Information Science (M.L.I.Sc.). Students who complete the bachelor's degree, the librarianship or one of the master's degrees offered get work as librarians, information employees or organization staff. The students can also obtain a Ph.D. in Library and Information Science at The Royal School of Library and Information Science (first awarded at The Royal School of Library and Information Science in 2004). The students can also obtain a doctorate in Library and Information Science at The Royal School of Library and Information Science (first awarded at The Royal School of Library and Information Science in 2006). =Philippines= In 1914, the University of the Philippines offered the first courses in Library education in the country. The University would later establish the first separate library school in the country in 1961; the Institute of Library Science, a former department of the now defunct College of Liberal Arts. Librarians usually have a four-year bachelor's degree in library and information studies, or a master's degree in LIS or one with a concentration in Library Science. It is also not uncommon for librarians to possess a degree in Education, with a specialization or major in Library Science. With passage of the Republic Act No. 6966 (Repealed in 2003 with the passing of R.A. 9246 or \\"The Philippine Librarianship Act of 2003\\") in 1990, graduates of library and information science are required to take the licensure examinations for librarians in order to practice librarianship in the Philippines or countries which have reciprocity as regards the practice of the field. =New Zealand= In New Zealand, Victoria University of Wellington is the only university providing postgraduate education in librarianship. Qualifications include Master of Information Studies (course based) and Master of Arts (thesis based) as well as postgraduate diploma and certificate in librarianship. Open Polytechnic provides undergraduate librarianship education. =Australia= Contemporary professional entry as a librarian is at three levels: * Three-year undergraduate (bachelor) qualification * One- year postgraduate (graduate diploma) qualification * One-, one-and-a-half, or two-year postgraduate (master's level) qualification The Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) is the professional organisation for the Australian library and information services sector and accredits qualifications enabling graduates to be eligible for Associate membership of ALIA, a common requirement for librarian positions in Australia.

In the , Richlands had a population of 3,598 people.  Geography  Richlands is by road south-west of the Brisbane CBD. The Centenary Motorway passes through the suburb from north-west (Darra) to south- west (Wacol / Forest Lake). The Springfield railway line runs parallel and to the immediate east of the motorway. Richlands railway station () serves the suburb. The land use in the north and west of the suburb is industrial extending west into Wacol with the residential areas in the east and south of the suburb extending east into Inala. A few small areas of farmland still exist within the suburb. Ric Nattrass Creek rises in the south of Richlands and flows north and exits the suburb to the north-west into Wacol where it becomes a tributary of Bullock Head Creek, then Wolston Creek, ultimately into the Brisbane River and Moreton Bay. It was named in 2013 after wildlife expert and conservationist Ric Nattrass (1949-2009). History The name Richlands comes from the Richland Estate, which was a subdivision of small farms sold in 1928‚Äì1829. The farms were and cost ¬£55, and could be purchased for a deposit of ¬£2 and monthly payments of 20 shillings. Richlands was part of the larger suburb of Darra until Richlands officially became a suburb in 1975. Early industries in the suburb were dairy and poultry farming, honey production and table grape growing. On 12 June 1934, Richlands State School was opened with one teacher on the south-east corner of Pine Road and Orchard Road (). It closed on 31 December 2010. Richlands East State School opened on 23 January 1967 in Poinsettia Street (). It is now within the boundaries of Inala. Richlands State High School opened on 27 January 1970 in Poinsettia Street immediately west of Richlands East State School (). In the 1990s it was decided to amalgamate Richlands State High School with Inala State High School to create a new school called Glenala State High School. The amalgamation commenced in 1996 when the Year 8, 9, and 11 students were transferred into the new school, while the Years 10 and 12 student completed their final year at Richlands, after which the Richlands State High School was closed completely on 13 December 1996. The Richlands drive-in theatre opened in the late 1970s at 295 Archerfield Road (), closing in December 2000 making it the last to be operating in Brisbane. The suburb is home to a number of recreational clubs including the Brisbane West Tennis Centre which opened in the early 1980s, Richlands Tenpin Bowl which opened in 1991 and the Darra Oxley Pony Club. In the , Richlands had a population of 3,598 people.  Amenities  The suburb is home to Queensland Lions Football Club who play in the Brisbane Premier League. CJ Greenfield Park includes football and soccer fields, cricket grounds, basketball courts, walking trails, and a children's playground. Other sporting facilities in Richlands include Pony Club, West Brisbane Tennis Centre, and Ten Pin Bowling. Services and organisations located in Richlands include the Magistrates Court, Queensland State Emergency Service, and Richlands Community Centre. Shopping precincts include Richlands Plaza and Progress Corner.  Education  There are no schools in Richlands.

To do so, he garrisoned French troops in the town, a highly unpopular action that caused widespread fear and anger among the Flemish in Bruges. History During the night of 18 May 1302, armed insurrectionists led by Pieter de Coninck and Jan Breydel entered the houses where the French were garrisoned and massacred them in their sleep using their \\"goedendag\\", a sharp pike they stuck into the victims' throats. According to tradition, to distinguish the French from the natives, they asked suspects to repeat the shibboleth: \\"schild en vriend\\" which means \\"shield and friend\\" a phrase difficult to pronounce for a French speaker. Another version suggests the alternative \\"des gilden vriend\\", \\"friend of the guilds\\". Only the governor, Jacques de Ch√¢tillon, who absconded after he failed to rally the garrison, and a handful of the French managed to escape with their lives. Approximately 2,000 people are estimated to have died. After the Bruges Matins, Jan Breydel and Pieter de Coninck were celebrated as the leaders of the insurrection. Their statue, which was an initiative of Julius Sabbe, has decorated the market in Bruges since 1887.

It is an adaptation of the book Crusade in Jeans by Thea Beckman.  Plot  Dolf is a 15-year-old boy from Rotterdam who plays for the junior national football team. At the beginning of the film, Dolf and his team are playing an important championship game against the Belgian team in the German city of Speyer, They were trailing by a goal, and got the chance to equalise in the final minutes which Dolf blew. Dolf's mother works in a research centre in Rotterdam where a time machine has been developed. It allows an object, animal or person to be moved to a specified time and place in the past, and to bring them back again. But, a person moving to the past can only return to the present by being at an exact location at an exact time. Furthermore, a special medication is needed daily to stay alive in the past. Dolf decides to go back in time one day to replay the match, since he regularly visits his mother at the lab, assists with the work, guards know him, the iris scan authorization check lets him pass, and he knows his mother's password to the computer system. However, the activation of the system alarms the guards. Dolf manages to operate the machine just in time before the guards can stop him, but in his haste he accidentally enters the password instead of the destination date, and consequently travels to the year 1212. He ends up at the location of the present-day football stadium, not far from the city of Speyer, which already existed then. After being attacked by vagabonds and being saved by a girl named Jenne, Dolf joins Jenne in the Children's Crusade: 8,000 children traveling from Germany to Jerusalem to pray for the city's deliverance from the Muslims. The crusade is led by Nicolaas, a teenaged boy with visions, and an adult priest, Father Anselmus. Although it is a long detour, Anselmus has decreed that the children will travel to Jerusalem via Genoa, where Nicolaas expects the sea to part, so the children can walk to the Holy City. What the children don't know is that Anselmus has secretly planned to sell the children to slave traders in Genoa, instead of bringing them to Jerusalem. During the crusade, Dolf applies his modern-day knowledge to save the lives of many children, battling disease, kidnappers and hunger. He even saves one of the leaders, Prince Carolus, from drowning. All this helps him gain the respect of the children and Nicolaas. However, Anselmus and his bodyguard Vick are intent on discrediting Dolf and try to destroy his reputation whenever they can. Outside Genoa, they finally succeed in making Nicolaas and the other children believe Dolf is an agent of the devil, who should be executed. Dolf manages to escape his execution at the last moment with the help of Jenne and Carolus and finally uncovers Anselmus' plan to sell the children as slaves. Meanwhile, Dolf's mother succeeds in sending him a message telling him the date and place of his return, after learning of his deeds and whereabouts in a mediaeval manuscript by Thaddeus, a monk whom Dolf has befriended. Although Dolf and Jenne succeed in getting to the location on time, a fight with the slave traders erupts and Dolf is forced to leave Jenne behind in 1212 and return to the present alone. Back home, Dolf manages to persuade his mother to let him go back to 1212 in order to get Jenne. His mother agrees and Dolf leaves for 1212 once more, setting a new time and place for his return. In European territories the film ends here. For American audiences, an extra scene was added in which Dolf has once again returned to the present, this time with Jenne. He is seen replaying the football match he lost in the beginning of the film, with Jenne cheering him on in the crowd.

It was developed in 1854 by German physiologist Karl von Vierordt (1818‚Äì1884). It is considered the first external, non-intrusive device used to estimate blood pressure. The device was a system of levers hooked to a scale- pan in which weights were placed to determine the amount of external pressure needed to stop blood flow in the radial artery. Although the instrument was cumbersome and its measurements imprecise, the basic concept of Vierordt's sphygmograph eventually led to the blood pressure cuff used today. In 1863, √âtienne-Jules Marey (1830‚Äì1904) improved the device by making it portable. Also he included a specialized instrument to be placed above the radial artery that was able to magnify pulse waves and record them on paper with an attached pen. In 1880, Samuel von Basch (1837‚Äì1905) invented the sphygmomanometer, which was then improved by Scipione Riva-Rocci (1863‚Äì1937) in the 1890s. In 1901 Harvey Williams Cushing improved it further, and Heinrich von Recklinghausen (1867‚Äì1942) used a wider cuff, and so it became the first accurate and practical instrument for measuring blood pressure.

This bursa is at the top, outer side of the femur, between the insertion of the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles into the greater trochanter of the femur and the femoral shaft. It has the function, in common with other bursae, of working as a shock absorber and as a lubricant for the movement of the muscles adjacent to it. Occasionally, this bursa can become inflamed and clinically painful and tender. This condition can be a manifestation of an injury (often resulting from a twisting motion or from overuse), but sometimes arises for no obviously definable cause. The symptoms are pain in the hip region on walking, and tenderness over the upper part of the femur, which may result in the inability to lie in comfort on the affected side. More often the lateral hip pain is caused by disease of the gluteal tendons that secondarily inflames the bursa. This is most common in middle-aged women and is associated with a chronic and debilitating pain which does not respond to conservative treatment. Other causes of trochanteric bursitis include uneven leg length, iliotibial band syndrome, and weakness of the hip abductor muscles. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome can remain incorrectly diagnosed for years, because it shares the same pattern of pain with many other musculoskeletal conditions. Thus people with this condition may be labeled malingerers, or may undergo many ineffective treatments due to misdiagnosis. It may also coexist with low back pain, arthritis, and obesity.  Signs and symptoms  The primary symptom is hip pain, especially hip pain on the outer (lateral) side of the joint. This pain may appear when the affected person is walking or lying down on that side. Diagnosis A doctor may begin the diagnosis by asking the patient to stand on one leg and then the other, while observing the effect on the position of the hips. Palpating the hip and leg may reveal the location of the pain, and range-of-motion tests can help to identify its source. X-rays, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging may reveal tears or swelling. But often these imaging tests do not reveal any obvious abnormality in patients with documented GTPS. Prevention Because wear on the hip joint traces to the structures that support it (the posture of the legs, and ultimately, the feet), proper fitting shoes with adequate support are important to preventing GTPS. For someone who has flat feet, wearing proper orthotic inserts and replacing them as often as recommended are also important preventive measures. Strength in the core and legs is also important to posture, so physical training also helps to prevent GTPS. But it is equally important to avoid exercises that damage the hip. Treatment The primary treatment is rest. This does not mean bed rest or immobilizing the area but avoiding actions which result in aggravation of the pain. Icing the joint may help. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may relieve pain and reduce the inflammation. If these are ineffective, the definitive treatment is steroid injection into the inflamed area. Physical therapy to strengthen the hip muscles and stretch the iliotibial band can relieve tension in the hip and reduce friction. The use of point ultrasound may be helpful, and is undergoing clinical trials. In extreme cases, where the pain does not improve after physical therapy, cortisone shots, and anti-inflammatory medication, the inflamed bursa can be removed surgically. The procedure is known as a bursectomy. Tears in the muscles may also be repaired, and loose material from arthritic degeneration of the hip removed. (At the time of bursal surgery, a very close examination of the gluteal tendons will reveal sometimes subtle and sometimes very obvious degeneration and detachment of the gluteal tendons. If this detachment is not repaired, removal of the bursa alone will make little or no difference to the symptoms.) The bursa is not required, so the main potential complication is potential reaction to anaesthetic. The surgery can be performed arthroscopically and, consequently, on an outpatient basis. Patients often have to use crutches for a few days following surgery up to a few weeks for more involved procedures. There are numerous case reports in which surgery has relieved GTPS, but its effectiveness is not documented in clinical trials.

History Answerable only to the White House, it handles anti-terrorist and anti-crime missions that are beyond the capability of established agencies like the CIA, NSA, and FBI. This usually means a mission that the U.S. Government can disclaim any knowledge of if it goes sour, or something that is just too dangerous for regular agencies to handle. Operating out of a former CIA training facility located in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains, Stony Man was created to tap into the expertise of Mack Bolan, a.k.a. the Executioner, for a covert war against terrorism. Bolan was the perfect choice to lead this new war because of his successful campaign against the Mafia. In his new identity of Col. John Phoenix, U.S. Army (Retired), Bolan undertook several campaigns against terrorists and the KGB, sometimes leading either Able Team or Phoenix Force. In the novel Stony Man Doctrine, he led both teams against a massive terrorist campaign against the United States. All their missions were successful. However, Mack Bolan and Stony Man would learn that success came with a price. A KGB-sponsored mercenary team led by a former Green Beret named Al Miller assaults the Stony Man compound in an effort to wipe out the organization. The team is dealt with, but not without casualties. The Stony Man computer expert, Aaron Kurtzman, is permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Andrzej Konzaki, Stony Man's weaponsmith is killed in the attack. The most painful casualty for Bolan was the death of his lover, April Rose, who was Stony Man's mission controller. Ms. Rose deliberately steps in the path of a bullet fired by Captain Wade. The Captain, head of Stony Man security, was also a mole for Al Miller and his cohorts. Wade had killed Miller to keep from being exposed and tried to assassinate Bolan, but Ms. Rose's sacrifice prevented this. Stony Man was attacked three more times subsequent to this attack, once by Jared Quillian, a renegade industrialist, the second time by a leftover Russian KGB agent who posed as a Stony Man Blacksuit and used an investigative reporter seeking to make a name for herself as an unwitting accomplice, and the third time by forces from the Nazi organization COMCON. In another blow to the organization, Mack Bolan, in his identity of Col. John Phoenix, was framed for the assassination of Damien Macek, labor leader and anti-communist dissident, by the KGB, resulting in him being labeled a dangerous, unstable renegade by all law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. In an effort to clear his name, Bolan discovered the plot was conceived by Maj. Gen. Greb Strakhov, head of the KGB's Department 13 executive action unit. Strakhov had masterminded the Macek plot in revenge for the death of his only son, Kyril Strakhov, a test pilot Bolan had killed during a mission in Afghanistan to recover a top-secret attack helicopter called Dragonfire. During his quest to clear his name, Bolan uncovered evidence that Lee Farnsworth, the director of a rival agency called the CFB (Central Foreign Bureau), was Strakhov's mole inside America's intelligence apparatus. After giving the evidence to the President of the United States, Bolan executed Farnsworth in the Oval Office itself. After this confrontation, Bolan initiated a one-man war against the KGB, working from a master list of all major KGB agents that he obtained during a mission in Moscow days earlier. He also struck out at other terrorist groups and resumed his war against his old enemy, the Mafia. After this lengthy one-man war and some soul-searching‚Äînot to mention the kidnapping of Hal Brognola's family by the Mafia and renegade CIA agents‚ÄîBolan entered into an arms-length alliance with Stony Man, working with his former comrades, but not rejoining the organization outright. Gold Eagle combined the two Executioner spin-off books, Able Team and Phoenix Force, to create the Stony Man series of novels, which are still being published as of 2008. Commando teams *Able Team Able Team has been assigned to handle anti-terrorist missions inside the United States, but sometimes operates in the lower Americas and Mexico. Its members are Hermann 'Gadgets' Schwarz, Carl 'Ironman' Lyons, and Rosario 'Politician' Blancanales. *Phoenix Force Phoenix Force has been assigned to handle anti-terrorist missions outside the United States, but sometimes has handled missions inside U.S. borders if they had international implications. Its current members are David McCarter, Gary Manning, Rafael Encizo, Calvin James, and T.J. Hawkins. Stony Man crew In their fight against criminals and terrorists, Mack Bolan, Able Team and Phoenix Force would be supported by a cadre of loyal allies, some of whom have associations with Mack Bolan from his first Mafia war. =Current= *Hal Brognola Harold Brognola is the Stony Man project director. He is responsible for assigning missions to both Phoenix Force and Able Team, as well as providing them with intelligence, weapons, transportation, and anything else they may require to conduct their assignments. Brognola enjoys chewing on expensive cigars. Hal is most frequently seen chomping down large amounts of antacid tablets and is almost never without a roll or two in his pockets. Being a high-ranking Justice Department official, Hal frequently shuttles back and forth between Stony Man and Washington, D.C. (which he frequently refers to as Wonderland or Wonderland on the Potomac). Started his law-enforcement career as a police officer in Washington, D.C., then went on to become an FBI agent, eventually leading the task force assigned to bring in Mack Bolan. After briefly chasing Bolan for some time, Hal came to realize that the Executioner was doing a public service and secretly assisted him in his anti-Mafia campaigns. He would later move on to the Sensitive Operations Group, the covert operations section of the Justice Department, which would later have the Stony Man organization under its auspices. *Jack Grimaldi Stony Man's ace pilot, Grimaldi is often called on to assist in situations which require the use of air assets. Grimaldi is competent with all aircraft, both fixed-wing and helicopters. A Vietnam veteran, Grimaldi once flew for the Mafia until he encountered Mack Bolan, who converted him to his cause. Until Stony Man was assembled, Grimaldi served as Bolan's mole, giving the Executioner information on the travels of high-ranking mobsters. Grimaldi would later undertake his first mission for Stony Man when he rescued Mack Bolan during a mission in Panama. In the series, Jack Grimaldi pilots the Dragon Slayer, a high-tech transport helicopter with attack capabilities. The Dragon Slayer is outfitted with a 7.62mm minigun and an array of missiles and rockets. It is fast and highly maneuverable, not to mention comfortable for the pilot and passengers. *Aaron \\"The Bear\\" Kurtzman Kurtzman is the computer expert of the Stony Man farm. His role is to obtain intel from other government agencies and process it. Kurtzman lost the use of his legs in an assault on Stony Man Farm, and has since been forced to use a wheelchair. He has made several attempts to regain the use of his legs. Aaron is called \\"The Bear\\" because of his physical makeup, sort of like a bear. Aaron is best known for his coffee, which he always has brewing in Stony Man's computer annex. His coffee, which he serves in ceramic mugs, has often been referred to as swill. It has often been said that the most gutsy thing a Stony Man personnel can do is to drink a cup of Aaron's coffee. *Barbara Price Taking over from April Rose, Barbara Price serves as Stony Man's mission controller. At the request of the President, she assisted with the security clearances when Stony Man was initially set up. She and Mack Bolan are friends and sometimes lovers. She was married to Washington, D.C. defense attorney Kevin Shawnessy for four years, but divorced him because of his countless affairs with other women. Used to work for the NSA as a mission controller and operated under the secret identity of Canary. Had a second cousin on her mother's side who was a member of Greenpeace until the 1970s, when he was thrown out for advocating violence. *Buck Greene Taking over from the man who replaced the traitorous Captain Wade, Buck Greene serves as Stony Man's chief of security and leads the Blacksuits, a security force maintained by Stony Man to provide security for the Farm. Greene once worked on the embassy security detail for the United States Marine Corps. Reports directly to Barbara Price. *Charlie Mott A former Vietnam veteran and ex- Marine, Charlie Mott is the second Stony Man pilot, behind Jack Grimaldi. Even though he prefers to stick to pilot duties, he has often had to do commando work. Listed as being Canadian in the novel Stony Man V. *John Kissinger Taking over from the murdered Andrzej Konzaki, John 'Cowboy' Kissinger serves as Stony Man's weaponsmith. Kissinger first worked for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the predecessor to the DEA. After the dismantling of the BNDD, Kissinger went freelance, offering his talents to companies like Colt, Beretta, Heckler & Koch, and IMI. The CIA considered hiring Kissinger, but he met Aaron Kurtzman, who recommended him to Brognola. Thus began his career as Stony Man's weapon specialist. He invented his own handgun, the QA-18 Stealthshooter, whose design was stolen by his crooked partner, Howard Crosley. He was able to recover his invention during an Able Team mission in Alabama, selling the patent shortly thereafter. Since joining Stony Man, Kissinger's talents have been to the benefit of Mack Bolan, Able Team and Phoenix Force, including instances where he has improved on Konzaki's designs. Has often participated in Stony Man field missions. He was once asked his full name to which he replied \\"you will never believe it.\\" This was because of the last name Kissinger. *Prof. Huntington Wethers A former cybernetics professor at UCLA, Huntington 'Hunt' Wethers was recruited by Aaron Kurtzman for his expertise in computers and cybernetics. While Kurtzman looks at computers as a means of leveraging information, Wethers looks at computers as a science. *Akira Tokaido Of Japanese extraction, Akira Tokaido is an expert computer hacker and the youngest member of Stony Man's cybernetic team. He listens to rock music on his headphones, which are often attached to a cassette player or CD player, claiming that it helps him focus on his work. At times, he is unconventional in his thinking and is cocky. He is an expert in kanji and has a deep interest in learning about his Japanese heritage. *Leo Turrin Like Mack Bolan, Rosario Blancanales and Hermann Schwarz, Leo 'The Pussy' Turrin is a Vietnam veteran and former Green Beret. His association with the Mafia came because of connections his family had. He rose up through the ranks and became a capo, involving himself in various criminal activities. However, his Mafia associates were unaware of his most important‚Äîand most dangerous‚Äîsecret: Leo Turrin was a federal agent. Code-named Sticker, Turrin was assigned to infiltrate the Mafia at the highest levels by Hal Brognola. During his undercover assignment, Turrin became head of the Mafia's prostitution racket during his stint with the family of Don Sergio Frenchi in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Mack Bolan's hometown. In this capacity, he was inadvertently responsible for the Executioner's sister, Cindy Bolan, becoming a prostitute to help her father pay off the debt he had with Triangle Industrial Finance, Frenchi's loan sharking outfit. Unaware of Turrin's dual role, Bolan targeted him for execution in one of his first battles with the Mafia, but his execution attempt was thwarted by Turrin's wife, Angelina. It was only later that Bolan became aware of Turrin's true mission. Since then, he and Turrin became allies and close friends, a friendship that became stronger when Turrin's family had been kidnapped by Mafia soldiers. When Turrin's role in the Mafia ended, he became a high-ranking Justice Department official under the name Leonard Justice. To this day, his Mafia associates think he is semi- retired but available for special matters related to the mob. =Former= *Dr. Lao Ti Of Vietnamese and Mongolian extraction, Lao Ti was brought in to serve as Stony Man's communications and computer specialist after the death of April Rose during the attack on Stony Man Farm. Even though she was originally Aaron Kurtzman's technical assistant, she often joined Able Team in the field. During an Able Team mission involving Maria Blancanales, the youngest of two sisters of Rosario 'Pol' Blancanales, Lao Ti was severely wounded during a shoot-out and took an extended leave of absence from her Stony Man duties. Was contacted by the State Department, who offered her a position with the U.S. Embassy in Taipei, Taiwan. =Deceased= *April Rose As the first mission controller and overseer of Stony Man Farm, the organization's headquarters, April Rose would at first seem an unlikely choice to become part of a counter- terrorist organization. She had started out as a pacifist, disapproving of war and its violent nature. She first met Mack Bolan during the closing week of his first Mafia war, when Hal Brognola had assigned her to drive the Executioner's War Wagon, which was a surprise to Bolan when he first met her. In response to that surprise, April challengingly asked him the following question: You don't like what you see? His reply did not come until a mission involving a renegade Japanese industrialist (Executioner #53: Invisible Assassins) when he replied, \\"I like what I see, April.\\" Standing over her grave, Bolan would later say, \\"Yes, April, I love what I see.\\" Hal once said of April, \\"This woman could be the love of Mack's life,\\" describing her as \\"having a super model's figure.\\" It is presumed that Hal recruited April as an inducement to get Bolan to join Stony Man. April's biggest desire was to be \\"Mrs. Bolan.\\" As a pacifist, she had disapproved of Bolan on ethical and personal grounds when they first met, even though she had found herself attracted to the big man in black. That all changed when the Executioner saved her life during one of his missions against the Mafia. She abandoned her pacifist ways and became loyal to Bolan and his cause. This loyalty would motivate her to fight alongside Bolan during his stint at Stony Man, including his mission against Paradine, a freelance mercenary Bolan believed dead in a previous mission. During a firefight in his second encounter with Paradine, April was severely wounded. In the first attack on Stony Man Farm, April's final act of loyalty was to step in the path of the bullet fired by the traitorous Captain Wade. She is buried alongside the late Andrzej Konzaki on the grounds of Stony Man Farm. Her favorite song was On The Road Again, sung by Willie Nelson. *Andrzej Konzaki Before John Kissinger came along, Konzaki was the first weaponsmith for Stony Man. He served in Vietnam as the leader of his own platoon. During the Tet Offensive, Konzaki led his platoon to the rescue of a unit that had been ambushed. During the mission, Konzaki was himself ambushed by a sniper who had shot him in both legs. He earned a Silver Star for his actions, but lost his legs. He was recruited by the CIA for his expertise as an armorer and weapons expert, assigning him to their Special Weapons Development branch. When Stony Man was first assembled, Konzaki was unofficially attached to the organization. His talents proved helpful to Stony Man, including his re-engineering of Mack Bolan's Beretta 93-R machine pistol. His most well-known Stony Man innovation is a specially modified Atchisson Assault Shotgun he made for Carl Lyons. He became the first casualty in the attack on Stony Man Farm, and Lyons would call his modified shotgun the Konzak to honor him. Associates In their fight against evil, Stony Man and Mack Bolan had allies who were not members of Stony Man, yet were very helpful. =Current= *Brig. Gen. James Crawford, USA Ret. A native of Arkansas, James Crawford is a retired brigadier general of the U.S. Army, and was Mack Bolan's commanding officer in Vietnam. He oversaw the creation of both Stony Man and the Central Foreign Bureau, the agency run by Lee Farnsworth. In Executioner #62, Day Of Mourning, Crawford, like the President, hoped to work out a compromise between the two agencies. His daughter, Kelly Crawford, was the girlfriend of Grover Jones, a.k.a. Damu Abdul Ali, an associate of Al Miller, but broke up with Jones after he used her as a shield in a confrontation with Bolan. *Tommy Anders Born Giuseppe Androsepitone, Tommy Anders is a stand-up comic known as the Ethnician, so named for poking fun at people's ethnic preconceptions and prejudices, with the Ranger Girls serving as his back-up act. His association with Mack Bolan began when he ran afoul of the Mafia, incurring their wrath by refusing to associate with Mafia-affiliated promoters and booking agents. It was some time after that Anders secretly became a federal agent, joining Carl Lyons and the Ranger Girls in Hal Brognola's SOG. *The Ranger Girls Serving as the back-up act for Tommy Anders, the Ranger Girls were a group of female multi-talented musicians led by Toby Ranger, the girl for which the group is named. Introduced in Vegas Vendetta and reappearing in Hawaiian Hellground and Detroit Deathwatch, Toby Ranger was Bolan's most frequent companion, and his only repeat engagement, until the introduction of April Rose. The other girls were Georgette Chebleu, a French- Canadian, Smiley Dublin and Sally Palmer. Mack Bolan became acquainted with them during his first Mafia war, when Toby risked her life to help him during a mission in Las Vegas. It was only after the end of the mission that Bolan discovered that the Ranger Girls were federal agents. Before Stony Man was founded, the Ranger Girls, Carl Lyons and Tommy Anders worked with the Executioner on many missions, including a mission in Hawaii to bring down an alliance between the Mafia and Communist China. Currently, there are only three Ranger Girls still involved in crimefighting. The fourth Ranger Girl, Georgette Chebleu, was tortured and mutilated by Mafia turkey doctor Fat Sal, prompting Bolan to give her a mercy bullet. The Executioner would later avenge her death. The Ranger Girls once aided Bolan in an escape from the Mafia by attracting attention with a \\"wild go-go routine.\\" Go Go routines were extremely popular in those days. This author remembers Toby by a catch phrase when she was attempting to get Mack to help out with one of their missions when she said, \\"We're soging it.\\" Soging was a made-up word out of the acronym for the group - Sensitive Operations Group or SOG for short. *Johnny Gray Johnny Gray is Mack Bolan's younger brother. Born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, he was the only survivor of the murder-suicide that occurred in the Bolan family home while Mack Bolan himself was serving in Vietnam. It was he who revealed to his older brother that their sister, Cindy Bolan, had become a prostitute to help her father with the debt he incurred from Triangle Industrial Finance. After he began his war, Mack Bolan left Johnny in the care of a former lover, Valentina Querente. The Mafia learned of Johnny's connection to the Executioner after Querente enrolled him in a private Massachusetts school that had the child of Harold 'The Skipper' Sicilia, Boston's capo, among its students. Sicilia and his men kidnapped both Johnny and Querente to use against the Executioner, but his scheme backfired, because Bolan not only rescued them but also brought down Sicilia's empire. Years later, Querente would marry federal agent Jack Gray, and the two would raise Johnny as their own, giving him the last name of Gray, with Bolan as his middle name. Johnny would join the Navy and participate in a mission in Lebanon, which would be his first taste of combat. When Bolan became Col. John Phoenix, Leo Turrin and Hal Brognola led Johnny to believe that he had died. It was only after he moved to San Diego that he learned that his older brother was still alive. The two would meet and go head-to-head with San Diego's godfather, Manny 'The Mover' Marcello, and his daughter, Angelina. During this mission, Johnny's fianc√©, Sandy Darlow, became a victim of the Mafia's turkey specialists, like the late Georgette Chebleu. At the end of the mission, Johnny proposed the idea of a support base where Mack Bolan could get some R and R and be safe from harm. Operating out of a secluded home in Del Mar, California, the support base would be called Strongbase One and contain the latest weapons and technology for the Executioner to use in his war against evil. Johnny Gray is one of the few people outside of Stony Man who knows intimate details about the organization without having visited it. Often provides intelligence to Stony Man and Mack Bolan. Also, he participates in some of his brother's missions, much to the Executioner's misgivings. =Deceased= *Nino Tattaglia Nino Tattaglia's association with Mack Bolan goes back to his first Mafia war. Tattaglia was an underboss for Don Carlo Nazarione, head of the Mafia in Baltimore, Maryland. However, during his Mafia career, he was captured by federal agents for a double homicide. He was given a choice: become a government informant, or face the electric chair. He wisely chose the former option, operating under the code-name Sticker, like Leo Turrin before him, and in fact replacing Turrin as the primary source for inside information on the mob. His information came in handy on an Executioner mission in Baltimore, when he notified Bolan on the Nazarione family's attempt to take over the Baltimore Police Department with the help of one of its high- ranking officers, Capt. Harley Davis. With Nino's help, Bolan ended the plot and dealt with Nazarione once and for all. During his time as a mole, Tattaglia underwent some private changes. He was no longer the evil criminal he once was and was now committed to the cause of justice. He would pay a terrible price for that commitment, as his double role was discovered by the Mafia, causing him to be executed by the mob. To this day, his presence is missed by Bolan, Brognola and Turrin. *Georgette Chebleu The only Ranger Girl to be killed in action during a tour of duty with the Justice Department. A French-Canadian, Chebleu became acquainted with Mack Bolan during his Las Vegas mission. During another Bolan mission in Detroit, Michigan, she was captured by Mafia soldiers and brought to Fat Sal, the Mafia turkey doctor. She was severely tortured and mutilated before Bolan came to rescue her. Unwilling to let her continue to suffer, Bolan shot her at point-blank range through the head. He avenged her death by killing those involved. Chebleu would, therefore, not have a chance to become part of Stony Man. Enemies Stony Man has locked horns with the most dangerous enemies to freedom and justice. They range from organized crime syndicates and terrorist groups to private companies involved in criminal activity. =Criminal organizations= *MERGE After the losses they suffered at the hands of Mack Bolan during his war on organized crime, remnants of the Mafia formed alliances with the Unione Corse, the Colombian cartels and the Mexican Mafia to form MERGE. Phoenix Force uncovered the existence of the organization while investigating the assassinations of two American officials in the Bahamas. They would later come across MERGE again in San Francisco while tracking the perpetrators of an attack on officers of the U.S. Coast Guard off the California coast. This time, however, they discovered that MERGE had locked horns with its Oriental counterpart, a syndicate called TRIO. They would also discover that TRIO was responsible for the attack on the Coast Guard officers. MERGE would later resurface in the Los Angeles area, where they kidnapped a scientist who was involved in the Strategic Defense Initiative and held him for ransom to either the United States or the Soviet Union. In this encounter with MERGE, Karl Hahn stood in as a replacement for Rafael Encizo, who was recovering from the injury he received on a mission against ODESSA in France. Their last known confrontation with MERGE was down in Colombia, involving one of its kingpins, a Bolivian drug lord named El Tiburon. His organization, known as El Dorado, had an association with the Colombian cartels and had been selected by MERGE to handle their latest enterprise: coordinated attacks against law enforcement teams dedicated to stopping the drug trade. To this end, El Tiburon formed an alliance with a Cuban military officer named Major Pescador. Phoenix Force invaded El Tiburon's lair and ended the scheme. During this mission, Rafael Encizo found his long-lost younger brother, Raul Encizo, who had become a Communist and was helping Maj. Pescador in his work with MERGE. *TRIO An Oriental counterpart to MERGE, TRIO was made up of the three most powerful organized crime groups in the Far East. The Yi-chyun Hai Shee, or Black Serpent Society (which should more properly be \\"Hei She Shehui\\"), was the Chinese part of TRIO. It was one of many tongs formed in the 17th century to combat the tyranny of China's Manchu overlords. Under the command of its leader, Wang Tse-Tu, the Black Serpent Society was one of the few tongs to go international, establishing branches in the United States and Western Europe. The Hebi Uji, or Snake Clan (which more properly should be \\"Hebi Ichizoku\\" as \\"uji\\" translates as \\"maggot\\"), was the Japanese part of TRIO. It was one of the countless Yakuza organizations that had roots in feudal Japan, where they were described as being \\"thieves with honor.\\" Led by Shimo Goro, the Snake Clan already had established a foothold in America by the time Japan became a player in international trade. Like most Yakuza organizations, the Snake Clan became involved in gambling, prostitution and gunrunning. The New Horde was the Mongolian part of TRIO. Under the command of Tosha Khan, the New Horde was involved in counterfeiting, white slavery, drugs, assassination and professional thievery. Born Altajin Illyvich Dzadgad, Tosha Khan claimed to be a descendant of Genghis Khan, the famed Mongol conqueror. Even though its activities were widespread and had a lot of manpower, the New Horde did not have the connections and influence he needed to be a player in organized crime. Therefore, he had it join forces with the Black Serpent Society and the Snake Clan. Thus, TRIO was born. Phoenix Force first learned of TRIO when it was investigating the aforementioned attack on the Coast Guard officers off California. It was during this mission that Calvin James got Phoenix Force in touch with John Trent, his old friend from his days in the SFPD. To help Phoenix Force, Trent turned to his uncle, Inoshiro Nakezuri, who had by this time become part of another Yakuza clan, the Kaiju Clan. The information Nakezuri gave to his nephew was of great value to Phoenix Force. Phoenix Force would later confront TRIO again in the Philippines, where they were investigating the disappearance of a Colombian ship carrying priceless treasure from Colombia. They would discover that TRIO attacked the ship and joined forces with the New People's Army, the Filipino Communist terror organization. They also learned that Lt. Robert Ferris and Lt. Daniel Mitchell, two American Naval Intelligence officers in charge of a contingent of U.S. Navy personnel assigned to protect the ship, had assisted TRIO in taking the ship in exchange for money to pay off severe gambling debts. With the assistance of Mahmud, a Filipino native and friend of David McCarter, Phoenix Force recovered the treasure. In an unusual situation (Phoenix Force #27: Weep, Moscow, Weep), Phoenix Force would join forces with the KGB to recover a biological weapon stolen from a Russian laboratory by the New Horde as part of a campaign of blackmail against the nations of the world. The last Phoenix Force mission against TRIO involved their old friend John Trent, who Stony Man believed had been responsible for the assassination of an executive for a Japanese automotive company. For this mission, they went to Col. Ken Ikeda, a Kompei officer they worked with when Keio Ohara was part of the team. They would learn that Trent was innocent of the crime. Trent and Phoenix Force would work with the Green Tiger Clan, a Yakuza clan that rivaled the Snake Clan, to bring down TRIO once and for all. =Terrorist organizations= *The New Order First appearing in Phoenix Force #41, Amazon Strike, this terrorist group is a neo-Nazi organization that was based in the Amazon jungle of Brazil. Its leader was Kurt Mohn, German industrialist. He was the son of Maj. Joachim Mohn, an SS officer, and Anna Kaufmann, a retired German showgirl. All his life, the young Kurt Mohn was indoctrinated into the beliefs of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. When his father died, Mohn inherited his company, Mohn Industries, which the former SS major founded with a substantial amount of cash he had accumulated during World War II. To finance the New Order's activities, Mohn established a cocaine smuggling ring in the Amazon, buying highly placed officials in the Brazilian government. This prompted a Brazilian police officer, Lt. Louis Farrango, to go to his DEA contact first, followed up by a secret visit to the Brazilian president, who told Farrango that he suspected that a secret cabal in his administration was consorting with an outside enemy group, later revealed to be the New Order. For this mission, Phoenix Force and Stony Man chief pilot Jack Grimaldi joined forces with Farrango and his informant, a drug user named Jorgio Cavantes. However, during the mission, Cavantes betrayed Phoenix Force, leading them into an ambush, resulting in Katz, James and Manning getting captured by Mohn's men. Cavantes would later expose Louis Farrango to his New Order masters, resulting in the Brazilian policeman getting captured and tortured. Encizo and McCarter, the only members of Phoenix Force not captured, came to his rescue, but were too late to save his life. During their captivity, Katz, James and Manning discovered that Farrango's partner, Emilio Santoro, who had infiltrated Mohn's organization, had been uncovered by the New Order and exposed to a lethal bacteriological weapon developed by the New Order. Called the Armageddon Virus, Mohn intended it to be used in a campaign of terror against the world's major nations, believing it would pave the way for a New Order takeover. However, Phoenix Force and Grimaldi, with the help of captured members of a Brazilian Indian tribe, ended Mohn's twisted scheme, destroying the data regarding the virus and obliterating the complex. Mohn escaped in the confusion, and has not been seen since. This mission is a pivotal incident in Stony Man history, because it is when Jack Grimaldi first used the Dragon Slayer, Stony Man's first operational combat helicopter. =Foreign intelligence agencies= *The KGB The Russian KGB was a recurring antagonist in the history of Stony Man. As the most famous and important intelligence agency of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the KGB attempted to spread Soviet influence, and Communism in general, wherever and whenever the opportunity arose. This was often accomplished using less savory methods. The KGB's credits include sponsoring terrorist activities, assassination of Western diplomats, theft of prototype nuclear missiles, kidnapping American researchers, and various other dastardly acts. Many of their plots have been foiled or brought to a halt by swift action from either Mack Bolan, Phoenix Force or Able Team; however, on one occasion (as noted previously), Phoenix Force has actually cooperated with the KGB to prevent a stolen Soviet biological agent from falling into undesirable hands. Despite their frequent failures due to the intervention of Mack Bolan and Stony Man, the Kremlin was not easily deterred by failure, and the KGB continued to conduct further covert warfare against the West until its demise in 1991 as a result of the end of the Cold War.  Headquarters  The headquarters of Stony Man is known as Stony Man Farm because it appears to the world as a working farm and its proximity to Stony Man Mountain, located in Shenandoah National Park. Stony Man Farm got its name because of its proximity to Stony Man Mountain where the face of the mountain resembles a dour-looking Indian chief.

His grandfather was Paul Joseph Coe. Coe was the first Aboriginal scholar at Cowra High School to study for the Higher School Certificate and to be elected a prefect. Career Coe was active in campaigns around the 1967 referendum and the establishment in 1972 of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, working with Pearl Gibbs, Chicka Dixon and Billy Craigie in the fight for basic human rights and justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Coe and a group of other activists including Isabel Coe, Gary Williams, Gary Foley and Tony Coorey also founded the Aboriginal Legal Service in 1970, the first free legal assistance service in Australia. He continued to play an important role in this organisation until the late 1990s. In 1979, he commenced, as plaintiff, an action in the High Court of Australia arguing that at the time white people came to Australia, Aborigines were there and therefore the Court had to recognise their rights.Coe v Commonwealth [1979] HCA 68 His claim was never heard due to serious deficiencies with his statement of claim. Chief Justice Gibbs said, at paragraph 21, 'The question what rights the aboriginal people of this country have, or ought to have, in the lands of Australia is one which has become a matter of heated controversy. If there are serious legal questions to be decided as to the existence or nature of such rights, no doubt the sooner they are decided the better, but the resolution of such questions by the courts will not be assisted by imprecise, emotional or intemperate claims. In this, as in any other litigation, the claimants will be best served if their claims are put before the court dispassionately, lucidly and proper form'. The main issue intended to have been raised in the case came before the High Court thirteen years later. The Court ruled in Mabo v Queensland (No 2) that some Aboriginal rights over land still vested in the Crown could survive European arrival and be recognised under the guise of native title. Disbarment In 1997, following proceedings in the Legal Services Tribunal, Paul Coe's name was removed from the roll of legal practitioners. The Tribunal found that Coe had sworn an affidavit which he knew to be false in a material particular. The affidavit in question was sworn in the course of family law proceedings, to which Coe was a party, and understated his salary by some $80,000.Coe v NSW Bar Association [2000] NSWCA 13 Coe appealed the decision, but the Supreme Court of New South Wales Court of Appeal upheld the Tribunal's decision. Both the Tribunal and the Court of Appeal commended Coe's role in advancing the interests of the Aboriginal community, however, the Court considered that Coe was not fit to practise, stating that the Court must be able to trust that barristers appearing before it would act in accordance with the law and would not mislead the Court. Media reports indicate that Coe was subsequently investigated by the Bar Association of NSW for continuing to practise despite being removed from the roll. The outcome of the investigation is unknown. References External links * * Paul Coe was 14 in 1963, son of L. J.

Education Pipe was educated at Queen's College, an independent school in the county town of Taunton in Somerset. Early career Pipe's initial efforts were conspicuously unsuccessful, his first winner coming with Hit Parade in a selling hurdle at Taunton in May 1975 under Len Lungo. It would be another 14 seasons before he would be crowned champion trainer for the first time.

His singing talent was similar to that of his contemporary Richard Crooks and baritones John Charles Thomas and Nelson Eddy who sang popular music but also had operatic careers. Melton usually catered to popular music fans, singing romantic songs and popular ballads in a sweet style. He was born in Moultrie, Georgia but was raised in Citra, Florida, where his parents grew melons and handled hogs. Melton's father ran a sawmill in the time of history when sawmills were temporary tent buildings built near available lumber trees. In 1920, he graduated from high school in Ocala, Florida and then attended college at the University of Florida, Vanderbilt University and the University of Georgia. He received vocal instruction from Gaetano de Luca in Nashville from 1923 to 1927 before moving to New York where he studied with Beniamino Gigli's teacher, Enrico Rosati. Melton also worked in dance bands, playing saxophone in a college jazz ensemble and performing with Francis Craig's Orchestra in Atlanta in 1926. Radio The following year, he began singing on New York radio for no pay. He joined \\"Roxy's Gang\\", a cabaret group led by Samuel Roxy Rothafel, who worked with the Sieberling Singers. He made records for Victor Records, singing as one of the tenors with The Revelers and for Columbia Records with the same group under the pseudonym of The Singing Sophomores. He frequently sang with popular singer Jane Froman and appeared with her in film as well. Melton recorded his first songs under his own name for Columbia in the autumn of 1927. He quickly became popular and made many vocal recordings also singing vocal choruses for dance records. By 1931, the Great Depression along with the rise of conservatism and a religious revival initiated a movement to more masculine sounding voices in popular music. Singers such as Franklyn Baur, Nick Lucas and Scrappy Lambert saw their careers diminish, while baritones such as Bing Crosby and Russ Columbo became popular. Tenor voices became viewed as outdated in popular music. Melton was forced to change paths and decided to try to continue his career with classical music. He began to train his voice with help from the pianist Michael Raucheisen in Berlin and gave his first concert performance at Town Hall on April 22, 1932 in New York and embarked on an American and Canadian concert tour along with songwriter George Gershwin in 1934. Melton continued to perform on the radio. He was heard on The Firestone Hour in 1933, on Ward's Family Theater in 1935, The Sealtest Sunday Night Party (1936), The Palmolive Beauty Box Theater (1937), The Song Shop (1938), the Bell Telephone Hour (1940), Texaco Star Theater (1944) and Harvest of Stars (1945). In 1941, a newspaper columnist described Melton as \\"currently one of radio's busiest singers.\\" In the thirties, Melton also sang and acted on the Jack Benny Radio Shows. Films Although he was not known as a dramatic actor, he appeared in movie musicals, including Stars Over Broadway (1935), Sing Me a Love Song (1936), Melody for Two (1937) and the MGM revue, Ziegfeld Follies (1946). An avid racing and automobile fan, Melton was in attendance for the Watkins Glen Grand Prix of 1951 in upstate New York. He is seen shaking hands with the racers in the 1999 documentary film about a classic race called Victory Circle James Melton at the starting line of the 1951 Grand Prix Street Race at Watkins Glen NY Opera After voice training with Angelo Canarutto, Melton's operatic singing career took off in 1938 when he appeared with the Cincinnati Zoo Opera Company as Pinkerton in Puccini's Madama Butterfly and also with the St. Louis Opera Company as Alfredo in Verdi's La Traviata. In 1939, he sang Pinkerton for his debut with the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company with Annunciata Garrotto as Cio-cio-san. He worked with the Chicago Civic Opera from 1940 to 1942, appearing with Helen Jepson in Madama Butterfly, with Lily Pons in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, with Ris√´ Stevens in Mignon and in Flotow's Martha. On 7 December 1942, Melton debuted at the Metropolitan Opera as Tamino in Mozart's The Magic Flute. He continued to perform at the Met through 1950. Melton spent the 1950s making records, singing in nightclubs, appearing on television, including Ford Festival (1951‚Äì1952) also known as The James Melton Show, and collecting rare automobiles. His last stage production was Sigmund Romberg's The Student Prince. Later life He established the Autorama, an auto museum in Hypoluxo, Florida. Ken Purdy interviewed him on his collection and wrote a book about it. The museum's collection was dispersed after his death. Melton has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one is for radio and the other for recordings of his. Melton died at the age of 57 in New York City in 1961.

It charted in April 1954, one year later. It took a year to get recognized on Your Hit Parade. It landed No.2 on the rhythm and blues chart and No. 14 on the pop chart. It was the first 1950s doo-wop record to sell over one million records. Recorded on an independent label, it was one of the first such R&B; records to crossover to the wider pop market. Song The song starts with a few bars of wordless vocals: ::duh-duda-duh-duda-duh-duda-duh-duh-duba followed by the lead vocal; ::Oh-ho-ho-ho gee,my oh-oh gee-hee, well oh-ho gee, why I love that girl. then the group: ::Love that girl! The vocals are upbeat making use of harmonies and nonsense syllables, in a matter resembling enthusiastic street-corner singing. This is accompanied with a modified jump blues instrumental backup, a catchy melody, and Charlie Christian-like guitar solo. History The Crows formed in 1951 as a typical street corner doo-wop group and were discovered at Apollo Theater's Wednesday night talent show by talent agent Cliff Martinez, and brought to independent producer George Goldner who had just set up tiny new independent Rama Records label. The Crows were the first group signed and the first to record. The first songs they recorded were as back-up to singer and pianist Viola Watkins. The song \\"Gee\\" was the third song recorded during the first recording session, on February 10, 1953. It was put together in a few minutes by group member, William Davis, with Viola Watkins also being credited as co-writer. Watkins also played piano on and co- arranged the song.Viola Watkins at Allmusic.com It has been suggested that the guitar break, based on the traditional Scottish tune \\"The Campbells Are Coming\\", may have been played by session guitarist Lloyd \\"Tiny\\" Grimes. The song was first released as the B-side of a ballad, \\"I Love You So\\". However, radio stations began turning it over and playing \\"Gee\\", first in Philadelphia and later in New York and Los Angeles. By January 1954 it had sold 100,000 copies, and by April entered the national R&B; and pop charts, rising to # 2 R&B; and # 14 pop. Although the song became a huge hit in early 1954, a year after it was recorded, the Crows were a one-hit wonder, as none of the follow- up records released had any chart success. The group broke up a few months after \\"Gee\\" dropped off the Hit Parade Legacy The Crows were one of the first doo wop groups and one of the first \\"bird\\" groups. \\"Gee\\" was one of the first rock and roll hit records. It has also been called the first rock and roll record because it was an original composition and had a quick dance beat. Although the Orioles' song \\"Crying in the Chapel\\" is frequently called the first R&B; record to crossover to a big white audience, it is actually a cover of a country song. \\"Gee\\" and its b-side \\"I Love You So\\" are considered seminal, as it is an original song by an all but amateur group. It encapsulated all that has been written later about neighborhood kids singing on corners, and retains that wonderfully amateurish feel. According to Bruce Eder at Allmusic: Biography of George Goldner by Bruce Eder, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 24 June 2014 > \\"Gee\\" by the Crows walked in on in the spring and summer of that year > [1953], and the music world was never the same. There would be better > records than \\"Gee,\\" even from Goldner's labels, but it was recognized as the > first R&B; single to get a significant part of its sales and chart success > from purchases by white teenagers - the first rock & roll single. Covers Jan and Dean released the song in 1960 on their album, The Jan & Dean Sound. The Hollywood Flames released a version of the song as a single in 1961 that reached #26 on the US R&B; chart.The Hollywood Flames, \\"Gee\\" chart position Retrieved February 4, 2016. The Pixies Three (Mercury 72250) with lead vocal by Debby Swisher, reached #87 on Billboard and #79 on Cashbox in 1964. The Beach Boys recorded a brief, idiosyncratic adaptation of the song as part of the unfinished concept album Smile. It was included on Brian Wilson's 2004 solo recording of the album in medley with \\"Our Prayer\\" as the introductory piece to \\"Heroes and Villains\\". Frank Zappa's The Mothers of Invention played the song some times during their first European Tour (September‚ÄìOctober 1967). A live recording can be found on Frank Zappa's official bootleg live album 'Tis the Season to Be Jelly included in the first volume of the collection of bootleg recordings entitled Beat the Boots released in July 1991.

Combining an \\"old dark house\\" mystery with hardcore sex scenes, Thundercrack! is more recently regarded as a cult film. It bears the influences of Jack Smith‚Äôs lush, DIY, camp aesthetic, Rainer Werner Fassbinder‚Äôs explosive melodrama, and Nan Goldin‚Äôs glimpses of countercultural bohemia.https://visualaids.org/artists/curt-mcdowell Plot The story begins during a thunderstorm. The house, which is shown in the opening shot, named Prairie Blossom, is very clearly fake which lends itself to comedic value. A caller, Willene Cassidy (Maggie Pyle), pays a visit to the house owner, Mrs. Gert Hammond (Marion Eaton), who is very drunk. She insists that she make herself presentable before she answers the door. This takes a very long time and she makes a bad job of putting on her makeup. In an effort to get the alcohol out of her system she makes herself vomit by putting her fingers down her throat. Finally, having retrieved her wig from the toilet, where it fell during her vomiting, she is ready to greet her visitor. Willene is shocked at the dishevelled appearance of Mrs. Hammond and insist on giving her a bath. Willene explains that her husband is a very famous yet untalented country music star, Simon Cassidy, whose music is heard on the radio during the later scene. During the course of the bath, Willene unintentionally masturbates Mrs. Hammond. It is also revealed that Mr. Hammond died and that their son \\"no longer exists\\". As the night goes on, more and more visitors appear to shelter from the storm. Among them is Chandler (Mookie Blodgett), widower of the incredibly wealthy Sarah Lou Phillips, whose family owns the largest girdle factory in the United States. Their popularity is such that few American women are without one. Chandler relates the story of his wife's death. She burned to death at a cocktail party, where there was a freak accident and her girdle caught fire. This caused burning rubber to envelop her head, and finally she fell dead into the swimming pool, her head steaming. This causes Chandler to have a bizarre sexual dysfunction. Although initially attracted to women, they would invariably prove to be owners of House of Phillips girdles. When they took off their clothes before sex, he would be reminded of the death of his wife and would not be able to maintain an erection. For this reason he had been having sex with other men, as they don't wear girdles that would remind him of Sarah Lou's horrific immolation. Rather strangely, during the telling of this story, Chandler is being fellated by Sash (Melinda McDowell) and has no apparent erectile problems. The two, while in the basement, discover that Mrs. Hammond had pickled the remains of her husband and kept them in a jar. She tells of the death of her husband, who had been working one day in the grain bin and got covered with grain dust. A swarm of locusts dove on him to eat the dust and in the process devoured much of Mr. Hammond's body. During the course of the night, many of the guests have sex with each other in various combinations. There are a great many sex toys at Prairie Blossom. Mrs. Hammond explains that her son collected them. They would be delivered in plain brown packages which she would take to him with his morning breakfast. This causes her to wistfully repeat that he \\"no longer exists\\". One of the guests, a man named Toydy, becomes obsessed with finding the key to a locked door in the house. One of the female guests, Roo (Moira Benson), finds the key but will not give it to Toydy (Rick Johnson) unless he agrees to ejaculate in her mouth. Despite not finding her attractive, Toydy agrees and manages to stay aroused by watching Bond (Ken Scudder) and Willene have sex. The final human guest at Prairie Blossom, Bing (George Kuchar), arrives in an agitated state. He had come from the circus in a vehicle containing a toothless lion, a near- blind elephant, and a female gorilla named Medusa. He explains to the group that Medusa is extremely dangerous and is likely to kill anyone she comes across. It is revealed that Bing himself is the cause of the apes murderous tendencies. His circus-mates, having got Bing drunk, convinced him to have sex with a prostitute. Despite her being hirsute, Bing is too drunk to decline. The next morning, he awakens to the pleasant feeling of being masturbated, though to his horror, the act is being carried out by Medusa, who now has a severe crush on him. She soon realises that her feelings are not being reciprocated and becomes enraged with him, and indeed all men. However, subsequent mistreatment by a female circus-worker causes these feelings to spread to women as well. The only way to calm Medusa is by giving her bananas. Toydy, having watched Bond and Willene have sex, decides to lie to Bond in order to have sex with him. Toydy says that he has a crate of bananas and will give them to Bond if he will have sex with him. Bond considers this carefully, not having had a homosexual encounter before, but agrees on the strength that he and Willene (who has by now forgotten about her husband) can use the bananas to escape the murderous primate. On discovering the deception, Bond takes it in his stride and tells Willene he had to be broken in sometime. He jokes that if things don't work out between himself and her, he can always try for her husband. Meanwhile, Toydy having gained the key to the locked door earlier opens it with Roo to discover Prairie Blossom's terrible secret. By morning, the fate of Roo and Toydy is unknown to the others. Chandler and Sash leave together, as do Bond and Willene, though Bond tells her he likes to sleep around too much to really settle down. Bing has married Medusa, though for some reason, he wore the wedding dress. Mrs. Hammond, alone with the jar containing her husband, proposes a toast to love, and pours Mr. Hammond's drink into his jar.MITTERNACHTSKINO - Thundercrack!

Since 1973, she has been the co-artistic director of the Santa Monica Playhouse. As an award-winning costume designer, she uses the pseudonym Ashley Hayes. Radio and television Born in Los Angeles, California, Rudie became an overnight star, in 1956, with her performance in the title role in the episode \\"Eloise\\" on television's Playhouse 90. It brought her critical acclaim, much press coverage, and an Emmy nomination at age six‚Äîthe first time a child actress was so honored. She returned to Playhouse 90 the following year, portraying the young Perle Mesta in The Hostess with the Mostest. The television \\"Eloise\\" was an adaptation of the popular book by Kay Thompson, which owed much to the delicate line illustrations of Hilary Knight. The marketing of \\"Eloise\\" and the subsequent book sequels practically always featured the illustrations of Knight, and numerous photographs were published in the 1950s of Rudie in the role. Her popularity as a child star led to the merchandising of at least one product which did not associate her with the character of Eloise, Evelyn Rudie Paper Dolls (Saalfield, 1958). During the late 1950s, she also appeared on Alfred Hitchcock Presents, General Electric Theater, Lawman, The Red Skelton Show, and Wagon Train, along with seven appearances on The Tonight Show with Jack Paar. During this period, she also was an actress on radio programs, including Suspense. Nine-year-old Evelyn Rudie appeared as a contestant on the October 29, 1959, episode of the TV quiz program You Bet Your Life, hosted by Groucho Marx.

He claims in an exclusive interview presented on the BBC's Newsnight programme on 16 November 2006 that the UK intelligence services were warned in the mid-1990s about the threat posed by al-Qaeda, but failed to act quickly enough. He also claims that Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi deliberately gave interrogators acting on behalf of the United States false information in order to encourage the USA to overthrow Saddam Hussein, thus allowing al-Qaeda to use Iraq as a jihadist base. In his book, he claims to be deaf in his left ear due to an accident when he was younger, when he was using a Q-tip to clean his ears when his brothers, who were roughhousing on a bed next to him, fell on him and drove the Q-tip deep into his left ear. While this is heavily considered to be true, because his book mentions how \\"minor details have been edited or fabricated for protection of the author\\", it is unclear if he is deaf in his left ear instead of his right, or if this ever really happened. Introduction to Abdullah and Abdurahman Khadr Nasiri's book Inside the Jihad: My Life with al Qaeda, a Spy's story contains Nasiri's account of meeting two boys he was to learn were sons of the Khadr family. Reid Morden, Running with, and from, al-Qaeda , The Globe and Mail, 25 November 2006 Although he identified them as Abdurahman and Omar Khadr, the family has disputed his identification, stating that it was Abdullah and Abdurahman who were at the camp.Guantanamo's Child, 2008 Nasiri states that, when he was attending the Khaldan training camp, ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, the camp's director, introduced the two boys as \\"Hamza\\" and \\"Osama\\". Infiltrating Al- Qaeda: At a terrorist camp, a French spy meets the battling Khadr brothers, Maclean's, 27 November 2006 According to Nasiri the two boys constantly fought with one another. He said their fights were unlike those of normal brothers, and gave an account of an incident on the marksmanship range, where the two boys were yelling at one another, turned their guns on one another, and all the other people on the firing range thought they were going to open fire on one another. Nasiri's account of Osama, the younger of the two sons, was that he was \\"almost hyperactive\\", and was constantly talking, bragging. According to Nasiri, he bragged about how important his father was, and offered Nasiri his first hint of Osama bin Laden's role in running the camp‚Äîtelling him \\"the other Osama\\" paid for all the food consumed there. Nasiri described the older son as much quieter, but he did tell about an incident, when he had been present in a public square, during the siege of Khowst, in 1991. A mortar shell landed in the square, but didn't go off. Nasiri said that the older son told him the Afghans were so desperate for money that a crowd started to try to dismantle the mortar shell, in order to sell the parts to the fighters. Nasiri said that he told him that everyone trying to dismantle the shell was killed in the explosion when one of the salvagers tried to get it open by hitting it with a hammer.

It was followed by three sequels: Hidamari Sketch √ó 365, a 13-episode season between July and September 2008; Hidamari Sketch √ó Hoshimittsu, a 12-episode season between January and March 2010; and Hidamari Sketch √ó Honeycomb, a 12-episode season between October and December 2012. Two special episodes for each of the first three seasons were broadcast in October 2007, October 2009, and October 2010, respectively, as well as two specials entitled Hidamari Sketch √ó SP in October and November 2011. A two-episode original video animation, Hidamari Sketch: Sae/Hiro Graduation Edition, was released on November 27, 2013. Since 2010, the series and specials have been licensed in North America with English subtitles by Sentai Filmworks. Plot Hidamari Sketch centers around a young girl named Yuno who finally is able to get accepted into Yamabuki Art High School, which she has longed for. To attend the school, Yuno moves and starts to live in a small apartment building named the located across the street from the school. Once there, she quickly becomes friends with three other occupants at the apartments, including her classmate Miyako and two second-year students: Hiro and Sae. The events of the characters' everyday lives are shown as they attend the school together and get to know each other better. After a year has passed, the girls move up a year and two freshmen, Nazuna and Nori, arrive at Hidamari Apartments. After another year passes, Hiro and Sae graduate while another freshman, Matsuri, moves into the apartments. Characters Hidamari Sketch main characters: Hiro (left), Yuno (center), Sae (right), and Miyako (bottom-right). =Hidamari Apartments= ; : :Yuno, sometimes called \\"Yunocchi\\" by Miyako, is the main character in the story and it is mainly through her viewpoint that the story is told, each episode of the anime usually ends with her pondering her feelings about what has gone on during the day, while taking a bath with her rubber duck. She is short and has a noticeably childlike appearance, has fairly short, light-brown hair and almost always wears a pair of black, X-shaped hairpins. She lives in room 201, next to her best friend and classmate, Miyako. She is a skilled artist overall but considers painting and drawing her specialties. :She is a very nice and conscientious person but suffers from low self confidence, constantly struggles with her perceived weaknesses, and often seeks advice from others on how to be a skilled artist, a self-sufficient person, more goal oriented, and eventually how to be a commendable and reliable senior to the younger residents in the apartment building and other junior students. She has shown more skill and interest in cooking over the course of the story, emulating Hiro, supporting Miyako, and in order to be a good mentor to Nazuna and Nori. She is also an only child in her family. ; : :Miyako, Miya-chan to her best friend and next door neighbor, Yuno, lives in room 202. She has very blonde, shoulder length hair and similarly light colored eyes. She comes from a large family who can't afford to support her like the other parents of the apartment residents can and, for that reason, lives in the slightly unfinished and correspondingly more affordable apartment in the complex; the main issue of her apartment being a very leaky roof. Her family situation also means she lives frugally and often relies on eating with her friends to satisfy her voracious appetite. She is a very spontaneous person and has an active and exuberant personality which borders on childlike, is always trying to have fun with her friends and claims the word \\"plan\\" does not exist in her dictionary. She likes to playfully tease her friends as well, prime targets being Hiro's weight and Yuno's child-like appearance. She is an undeniably creative and versatile artist though and often masters new skills quickly. She is also very physically talented, her senses are unusually strong and she can be very athletic, having taught herself how to ride a bicycle on an adult bicycle as soon as her feet could reach the pedals and being an extremely good (if unconventional) self-taught swimmer, among other talents. ; : :Hiro is a year older than Yuno and Miyako, living directly under Yuno's apartment in room 101. She has curly, salmon colored hair that reacts strongly to humidity, appearing to move on its own in the anime, which she wears it in a double bun, odango style. She is left handed. She moved from room 203 when she started her second year in order to be next to her best friend, Sae, and is one of Sae's principal sources of support when she is involved with a deadline or other crisis. She strives to be a supportive senior to the younger girls, and due mainly to her desire to support and properly feed Sae she became a great cook by the end of her first year. Beginning in her second year, the girls frequently get together at her apartment where she will cook for all of them. :She likes rich foods and sweets but tends to worry excessively about her weight, causing her to go on periodic diets. She is quick to retaliate whenever Miyako teases her about her weight, diet, or eating habits, which always result in Miyako receiving a comical lump on her head. Hiro is not a morning person; it is very difficult to wake her up in the morning and, when she does, she does so slowly, staying in a dazed state and uttering nonsensical gibberish to anyone around. She eventually develops the personal goal of becoming an art teacher and claims that Yoshinoya is her inspiration for that choice. She ends up going to a university to continue her art education. ; : :Sae is a year older than Yuno and Miyako, and lives in room 102, next to her best friend, Hiro. She has a younger sister (initially only featured in the anime), Chika. She is tall, athletic, has short dark hair and a generally tomboyish appearance, accentuated by her plain squarish eyeglasses. She tends to get upset when Miyako refers to her as having masculine qualities. She is a published author and writes fiction professionally under the pseudonym and enrolled at the school specifically so she could learn how to illustrate her own work. She also has an interest in photography. Sae sometime writes romantic stories but gets very uncomfortable when asked about her own (actually non-existent) love life, frequently inventing an absurd romantic history for herself, while blushing furiously. She has a similar reaction when she sees Hiro (but not the others) in compromising positions, when Hiro expresses her obvious affection for her, or when it appears other people are romantically interested in Hiro. :Sae is very reserved about expressing her feelings towards any of her friends and especially for her sister, Chika, who she frequently scolds despite holding obvious sisterly affection for. She has a playful side that can be at the same time enigmatic and cunning; she has a habit of giving Yuno just enough warning about potential problems for the younger girl to fail to avoid them. She also has a fondness for playing detective when faced with such anomalies as Miyako's apartment. She is often referred to as the \\"father\\" in the Hidamari Apartments \\"family\\", with Hiro as the \\"mother\\". The first student from her year that she met, even before Hiro, was Natsume, but due to being placed in a separate class and her life in the apartment, she was never able to become close friends with her, a fact that she occasionally seems to regret. Though it makes her sad to separate from Hiro, she goes on to attend a different University than her, one that will better develop her writing talents. ; : :Nori is another student introduced as a freshman with Nazuna. She is called \\"Norippe\\" by Miyako. She lives in room 103. She has lighter blue hair with pigtails. She is in the art department and likes to play with computers. Nori has said that her hobbies are Computer Graphics, HTML, and Adobe Flash. She is honest and straightforward. She is generally the most level-headed one out of the main characters and is usually pointing out the others' weird ways. She frequently has some sort of outburst if Nazuna is being too timid, and has been known to lecture and even vigorously shake Nazuna when Nazuna refuses to speak what is on her mind. She can speak in a Kansai dialect. ; : :Nazuna was introduced as a new freshman student in the July 2008 issue of Manga Time Kirara Carat and the third series of the anime, after a year has passed in the timeline of the main story. She lives in room 203. She has sandy blonde hair, braids, and long side bangs. Just months before starting high school her family's house had been in the neighborhood and it was her decision to stay close to home that led her to choose Yamabuki Art High School and enroll as a \\"general\\" (non-art) student, but when her father was transferred elsewhere for work and her mother followed with him, she ended up needing to board in Hidamari to attend school. She appears very quiet, reserved, and has an inferiority complex. It has been noted that Nazuna is very popular among the male student body because of her timid personality and that she can be quite a klutz, which makes others feel like they can't leave her alone. Nazuna is closest to Nori, since they are both first year students living at the apartments, and admires Yuno, whom she sees as an older sister. Although not in the art department, she shows interest in it. ; :Introduced in the April 2014 issue of Kirara Carat. A freshman in the art department who becomes a resident of the Hidamari Apartments at the start of Yuno's third year, after Hiro and Sae graduate. She is nicknamed \\"Festa-san\\" by Miyako as her name means 'festival'. Endlessly enthusiastic and aggressively friendly, Matsuri tries very hard to impress the other girls and live up to Hidamari's reputation for eccentricity. =Yamabuki High School teachers= ; : :Yoshinoya is Yuno and Miyako's homeroom teacher and art instructor. She is buxom, exuberant, and a cosplay maniac. She will frequently wear incredibly complicated costumes that are at times truly inappropriate and will often attempt to model them for her class, usually leading her to be scolded by the principal. Some of the things she says also tend to make her students uncomfortable. She still resides with her parents and is often criticized by them for not being mature. She is an extremely skilled artist and cares about her students very much but will go to any lengths to avoid doing the school's required paperwork. Otherwise she is shown to be a good teacher who can offer practical advice about their studies and future ambitions. When asked her age, she will answer \\"eternally seventeen\\". She has a younger brother who is already married and has a child. ; : :The Principal is a thin, aging and balding man who appears frail, as he constantly shakes, but occasionally exhibits great feats of athleticism. He appears most often to chastise Yoshinoya over her inappropriate behavior and inability to finish class paperwork. His name is unknown, but in one episode of the anime, Yuno was writing the names of people on pictures as part of an exam. When she got to the Principal, the whole class thought his name was \\"Moai\\". ; : :Kuwahara is the school nurse at Yamabuki High. She generally acts as a comic foil to Yoshinoya, who is almost always using her nurse's office to nap in. ; : :A male teacher who wears glasses and is the teacher of Class 2-B. He shares an office/workroom with Yoshinoya but she has basically taken over the space to store, construct, and try on her cosplay outfits and he is summarily scolded if he tries to enter without her permission. ; : :A female teacher with glasses. =Yamabuki High School students= ; : :Natsume is a student from class B who acts like a tsundere character toward Sae, masking her strong affection for her by maintaining a generally antagonistic attitude. During her first day at Yamabuki, she faced a lot of troubles and was helped by Sae and touched by her kind nature, developing feelings for her. To her dismay she was separated into another class and quickly became jealous and envious of Hiro's burgeoning relationship with Sae. Ever since, she has been trying to hide her feelings in Sae's presence by acting nonchalant, initially declaring herself to be her rival. Eventually though she becomes less confrontational around her and occasionally visits Sae and the others at the apartment, when invited. She is also one of the few people who knows of Sae's pen name and is an admirer of her books. After graduating, she goes to the same university as Hiro. ; : :Yuno and Miyako's classmate. ; : :Yuno and Miyako's classmate. ; : :An upperclassman two years above Yuno who she meets and becomes friends with one day.

Later on, she suggests to Yuno that she call her 'Arisa', as her fellow college friends call her that. ; : :The president of Yamabuki High School's Broadcasting Club, and is a third-year student when Yuno and Miyako are in the first year and Hiro and Sae are in the second year. She is an original character in the anime and doesn't appear in the manga adaptations. =Other characters= ; : :The Landlady is the female owner of Hidamari Apartments. She has quite a few masculine characteristics as she often wears a baseball cap, goes out for a fishing in her spare time, and is a heavy smoker. Although she has a very laid-back personality, she is often seen very busy doing various part-time jobs such as delivering pizza on her moped. Despite this, she is highly devoted to her tenants and sincerely believes she is doing them a great service, and in the graduation arc reveals the existence of a mutual- assistance society for former Hidamari Apartments tenants that she asks Hiro and Sae to join. ; : :Chika is Sae's younger sister, who is two years younger than her. She is more spontaneous and energetic than her older sister. She enjoys cooking and has an infatuation with a kabuki actor. She has no artistic talent and prefers music and home economics to art. Initially only appearing in the anime adaptation, she made her first appearance in the manga in the June 2012 issue of Manga Time Kirara Carat. ; : :Yuno's overprotective parents who are particularly weird in their own right. ; : :The former occupant of room 201 prior to the arrival of Yuno.

Tunnicliffe was born in Derby. He appeared for Derbyshire Juniors from 1968 and played for Derbyshire Second XI in one match during the 1971 Second XI Championship. In the 1973 season he made his debut in the County Championship against Essex when he expensively took no wickets for 81 runs although he was not out in both innings. He played regularly in 1973 and 1974. However, he did not play at all in 1975, and in 1976 played one first-class match and five games in the John Player League. He returned to regular appearances in 1977 and continued to play in Derbyshire's first team and one day competitions until 1983, staying on top of his game for much of this period. He achieved his best bowling performance of 7 for 36 against Essex in 1980. In the 1981 season, Tunnicliffe scored the winning run, which tied the scores with Derbyshire having lost fewer wickets, on the last ball of the NatWest Trophy final against Northamptonshire. In his final season in 1983 Tunnicliffe made his top score of 91 against Hampshire. Tunnicliffe was a left-arm medium-fast bowler and took 319 first-class wickets with an average of 32.17 and a best performance of 7-36.

Evans used different media in her work, but started with using wax and crayon. She was inspired to start drawing due to visions and dreams that she had when she was a young girl. She is known as a southern folk artist and as a surrealist and visionary artist as well.  Personal life  Evans (born Minnie Eva Jones) was born to Ella Jones on December 12, 1892 in Long Creek, Pender County, North Carolina. Ella was only thirteen years old at the time. Evans' biological father, George Moore, left after she was born. After Evans was only two months old, she and her mother moved to Wilmington, North Carolina to live with her maternal grandmother, Mary Croom Jones in 1893. Minnie Jones attended school until the sixth grade and in 1903, Minnie Jones, Ella, and Mary Croom Jones moved to Wrightsville Sound which was a town close to Wilmington. She attended St. Matthew African Methodist Episcopal Church in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. In Wrightsville, Ella Jones met her future husband, Joe Kelly, and they married in 1908. During this time, Jones worked as a \\"sounder\\" selling shellfish door to door. In 1908, one of Joe Kelly's daughter's from a previous marriage introduced Minnie Jones to Julius Caesar Evans. Minnie Jones, who was sixteen at the time, married Julius (19) that same year. The couple had three sons, Elisha Dyer, David Barnes Evans, and George Sheldon Evans. Beginning in 1916, Minnie Evans was employed as a domestic at the home of her husband's employer, Pembroke Jones, a wealthy industrialist. The Evans family lived on Jones's hunting estate, \\"Pembroke Park,\\" known today as the subdivision Landfall. Pembroke Jones died in 1919 and his wife, Sadie Jones remarried Henry Walters. The couple moved nearby to the Airlie Estate which was left to Sadie Jones from Pembroke Jones. Evans continued to work from Sadie Jones and now Henry Walters, on the Airlie Estate. After Walters died, Sadie Jones decided to turn the Airlie Estate into gardens which later became one of the most famous gardens of the south. After Sadie Jones died, a man named Albert Corbet bought the property in 1947 and assigned Evans to be the gatekeeper and take admission from public visitors. She held this position for the rest of her life. She retired from her job as the gatekeeper when she was 82 years old in 1974. Career Evans began drawing on Good Friday 1935, where she finished two drawings using pen and ink \\"dominated by concentric and semi-circles against a background of unidentifiable linear motifs\\". She heard a voice in her head that said 'Why don't you draw or die?' After this, Evans did not resume drawing until 1940. She started using pencil and wax on paper for her beginning works and she later worked with oil paints and mixed media collages. Her subject matter were usually either biblical scenes or scenes from nature. Her influences included African, Caribbean, East India, Chinese, and Western cultures. Since she held the position as gatekeeper at the Airlie Gardens, she often used the gardens as her inspiration in her work to depict nature scenes. Evans first started selling her work at the Airlie Gardens by hanging her pieces on the front gate of the gardens. Those who would come and visit the Airlie Gardens began purchasing her work. Soon she became known throughout the south and visitors would come to the gardens just to see her work. In 1961, she had her first formal exhibition of drawings and oils at the Little Artists Gallery (now St. Johns Museum) in Wilmington, North Carolina. In 1962, Evans met photographer, folk art specialist, and art historian, Nina Howell Starr. Starr, an artist herself (photographer), knew of Evans' work in 1961 and wanted to meet the artist in person. Starr would go on to represent Evans and publicize her work for the next 25 years. Evans originally sold her first paintings for 50 cents apiece. Starr, encouraged Evans to sell her paintings for better prices, and assisted Evans throughout her career. Evans felt her work was too personal to share with the public which held her from releasing anything until 1961, when she had her first major art exhibition at The Little Gallery in Wilmington, now known as St. John's Museum. From 1962 until 1973, Starr recorded interviews with Evans about her work. At first, Evans was wary to trust Starr with her work, but they gained a mutual respect for each other. Starr helped to launch Evans' career by storing and selling her art in New York City. She also guided her in the art world by making her sign and date her pieces. In 1966, Starr arranged for Evans' first New York exhibit at the Church of Epiphany and Clements Episcopal Church. In August 1969, another exhibition of Evans' work took place at the Art Image Gallery of New York and in 1975, curated a major Evans exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art. With failing health, another exhibition of her work was curated in 1980 at the St. John's Museum. She also had many other exhibitions in New York as well. Many art critics have labelled Evans work as \\"surrealistic\\", \\"visionary\\", and \\"psychedelic\\". Religion played a vital role in Evans life, as well as in many of Evans paintings. Evans confessed she wasn't sure of the meanings behind her paintings, stating, \\"when I get through with them I have to look at them like everybody else. They are just as strange to me as they are to anybody else.\\" Minnie Evans Bottle Chapel designed and built by Virginia Wright-Frierson Evans created \\"one of the most powerful works of art \\" which was a self- portrait on the cover of a scrapbook in 1981. Evans died in Wilmington, North Carolina on December 16, 1987 at age 95, leaving more than 400 artworks to the St. Johns Museum of Art (now the Cameron Art Museum) in Wilmington. After Evans's death, artist Virginia Wright-Frierson designed and built the Minnie Evans Bottle Chapel at Airlie Gardens in her memory. \\"Minnie Evans\\" day was proclaimed on May 14, 1994 in Greenville, North Carolina. Evans was the subject of the documentary, The Angel that Stands By Me: Minnie Evans' Art (1983), by Allie Light and Irving Saraf.  Famous works  =Inspiration, style, and technique= Evans began to draw and paint at the age of 43, creating her first pieces of artwork on a scrap of paper bag. Five years later she decided to really dedicate herself to recording her dreams through art. She painted her early works on US Coast guard stationery and later worked with more precision, using ink, graphite, wax crayon, watercolour and oil on canvas, board and paper.Outsider Art Sourcebook, ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.71 Evans' drawings were inspired by her dreams and filled with many colors, possibly inspired by her work at Airlie Gardens. Her designs are complex, with elements recalling the art of China and the Caribbean combined with more Western themes. The central motif in many pieces is a human face surrounded by plant and animal forms. The eyes, which Evans equated with God's omniscience, are central to each figure, often three eyes were depicted and frontal faces with concealed lips. Symmetry was also a common theme in Evans' work In addition, God is sometimes depicted with wings and a multicolored collar and halo and shown surrounded by all manner of creatures. =Works= Her first works, titled My Very First and My Second are ink on paper. The entire surface is filled with abstract designs and shapes with nature images and themes in both. These works are not in color. Another work titled \\"Design: Airlie Garden\\" depicts flowers, plants, and butterflies. The nature theme is shown here, but this piece is somewhat atypical due to the asymmetry of the painting. Two other works, both untitled are more typical works by Evans. One, dated 1996, depicts a woman with a feathered headdress and a green bird. This piece has bold colors, symmetrical, and includes nature themes. The media used is graphite, ink, tempera, and wax crayon on paper. The other is a female portrait including the theme of eyes, bold colors, and nature designs as well. The media used is gouache, ink and wax crayon on paper. Now recognized as one of the most important visionary folk artists of the 20th century, her work is highly collected by many museums and collectors all across the world. Despite her prolific and long career, her works do not come up for sale often. When they do, there is always strong competition. Her work can be viewed at the Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian Institution, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum, the American Folk Art Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, and the High Museum of Art. A review of a 2017 exhibit notes the contrast between Evans' later works -- \\"increasingly sophisticated\\" faces and greater \\"familiarity with nature\\"‚Äîwith her first drawings between 1935 and 1940, which \\"indicate her innate genius and awareness, in the raw and in transition.\\"  Publications  Art exhibition catalogues, in ascending order by date:  *  References  Further reading * *John Walker Myers, \\"Minnie Evans: Off in the Garden to Talk With God.\\" The Southern Quarterly.

Engineering economics, previously known as engineering economy, is a subset of economics concerned with the use and \\"...application of economic principles\\"Dharmaraj, E.. Engineering Economics. Mumbai, IN: Himalaya Publishing House, 2009. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 9 November 2016. in the analysis of engineering decisions.Morris, W. Thomas. (1960). Engineering economy: the analysis of management decisions. Homewood, Ill.: R. D. Irwin. As a discipline, it is focused on the branch of economics known as microeconomics in that it studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources. Thus, it focuses on the decision making process, its context and environment. It is pragmatic by nature, integrating economic theory with engineering practice. But, it is also a simplified application of microeconomic theory in that it avoids a number of microeconomic concepts such as price determination, competition and demand/supply. As a discipline though, it is closely related to others such as statistics, mathematics and cost accounting. It draws upon the logical framework of economics but adds to that the analytical power of mathematics and statistics. Engineers seek solutions to problems, and the economic viability of each potential solution is normally considered along with the technical aspects. Fundamentally, engineering economics involves formulating, estimating, and evaluating the economic outcomes when alternatives to accomplish a defined purpose are available. In some U.S. undergraduate civil engineering curricula, engineering economics is a required course.Undergraduate Programs Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering. Retrieved 6 April 2015. It is a topic on the Fundamentals of Engineering examination, and questions might also be asked on the Principles and Practice of Engineering examination; both are part of the Professional Engineering registration process. Considering the time value of money is central to most engineering economic analyses. Cash flows are discounted using an interest rate, except in the most basic economic studies. For each problem, there are usually many possible alternatives. One option that must be considered in each analysis, and is often the choice, is the do nothing alternative. The opportunity cost of making one choice over another must also be considered. There are also non-economic factors to be considered, like color, style, public image, etc.; such factors are termed attributes.Engineering Economy, 11th Ed., Sullivan, Bontadelli, and Wicks, Prentice-Hall, New York, 2000 Costs as well as revenues are considered, for each alternative, for an analysis period that is either a fixed number of years or the estimated life of the project. The salvage value is often forgotten, but is important, and is either the net cost or revenue for decommissioning the project. Some other topics that may be addressed in engineering economics are inflation, uncertainty, replacements, depreciation, resource depletion, taxes, tax credits, accounting, cost estimations, or capital financing. All these topics are primary skills and knowledge areas in the field of cost engineering. Since engineering is an important part of the manufacturing sector of the economy, engineering industrial economics is an important part of industrial or business economics. Major topics in engineering industrial economics are: * The economics of the management, operation, and growth and profitability of engineering firms; * Macro-level engineering economic trends and issues; * Engineering product markets and demand influences; and * The development, marketing, and financing of new engineering technologies and products.Engineering Firms: A Survey Of Factors Affecting Their Growth & Performance, Industrial Systems Research Publications, Manchester (UK), 2nd. Revised edition 2003, page 1. * Benefit‚Äìcost ratio  Examples of usage  Some examples of engineering economic problems range from value analysis to economic studies. Each of these is relevant in different situations, and most often used by engineers or project managers. For example, engineering economic analysis helps a company not only determine the difference between fixed and incremental costs of certain operations, but also calculates that cost, depending upon a number of variables. Further uses of engineering economics include: * Value analysis * Linear programming * Critical path economy * Interest and money - time relationships * Depreciation and valuation * Capital budgeting * Risk, uncertainty, and sensitivity analysis * Fixed, incremental, and sunk costs * Replacement studies * Minimum cost formulas * Various economic studies in relation to both public and private ventures Each of the previous components of engineering economics is critical at certain junctures, depending on the situation, scale, and objective of the project at hand. Critical path economy, as an example, is necessary in most situations as it is the coordination and planning of material, labor, and capital movements in a specific project. The most critical of these \\"paths\\" are determined to be those that have an effect upon the outcome both in time and cost. Therefore, the critical paths must be determined and closely monitored by engineers and managers alike. Engineering economics helps provide the Gantt charts and activity-event networks to ascertain the correct use of time and resources.DeGarmo E., Canada J., Engineering Economy, fifth edition, 1973. = Value Analysis = Proper value analysis finds its roots in the need for industrial engineers and managers to not only simplify and improve processes and systems, but also the logical simplification of the designs of those products and systems. Though not directly related to engineering economy, value analysis is nonetheless important, and allows engineers to properly manage new and existing systems/processes to make them more simple and save money and time. Further, value analysis helps combat common \\"roadblock excuses\\" that may trip up managers or engineers. Sayings such as \\"The customer wants it this way\\" are retorted by questions such as; has the customer been told of cheaper alternatives or methods? \\"If the product is changed, machines will be idle for lack of work\\" can be combated by; can management not find new and profitable uses for these machines? Questions like these are part of engineering economy, as they preface any real studies or analyses. = Linear Programming = Linear programming is the use of mathematical methods to find optimized solutions, whether they be minimized or maximized in nature. This method uses a series of lines to create a polygon then to determine the largest, or smallest, point on that shape. Manufacturing operations often use linear programming to help mitigate costs and maximize profits or production. = Interest and Money ‚Äì Time Relationships = Considering the prevalence of capital to be lent for a certain period of time, with the understanding that it will be returned to the investor, money-time relationships analyze the costs associated with these types of actions. Capital itself must be divided into two different categories, equity capital and debt capital. Equity capital is money already at the disposal of the business, and mainly derived from profit, and therefore is not of much concern, as it has no owners that demand its return with interest. Debt capital does indeed have owners, and they require that its usage be returned with \\"profit\\", otherwise known as interest. The interest to be paid by the business is going to be an expense, while the capital lenders will take interest as a profit, which may confuse the situation. To add to this, each will change the income tax position of the participants. Interest and money time relationships come into play when the capital required to complete a project must be either borrowed or derived from reserves. To borrow brings about the question of interest and value created by the completion of the project. While taking capital from reserves also denies its usage on other projects that may yield more results. Interest in the simplest terms is defined by the multiplication of the principle, the units of time, and the interest rate. The complexity of interest calculations, however, becomes much higher as factors such as compounding interest or annuities come into play. Engineers often utilize compound interest tables to determine the future or present value of capital. These tables can also be used to determine the effect annuities have on loans, operations, or other situations. All one needs to utilize a compound interest table is three things; the time period of the analysis, the minimum attractive rate of return (MARR), and the capital value itself. The table will yield a multiplication factor to be used with the capital value, this will then give the user the proper future or present value. =Examples of Present, Future, and Annuity Analysis= Using the compound interest tables mentioned above, an engineer or manager can quickly determine the value of capital over a certain time period. For example, a company wishes to borrow $5,000.00 to finance a new machine, and will need to repay that loan in 5 years at 7%. Using the table, 5 years and 7% gives the factor of 1.403, which will be multiplied by $5,000.00. This will result in $7,015.00. This is of course under the assumption that the company will make a lump payment at the conclusion of the five years, not making any payments prior. A much more applicable example is one with a certain piece of equipment that will yield benefit for a manufacturing operation over a certain period of time. For instance, the machine benefits the company $2,500.00 every year, and has a useful life of 8 years. The MARR is determined to be roughly 5%. The compound interest tables yield a different factor for different types of analysis in this scenario. If the company wishes to know the Net Present Benefit (NPB) of these benefits; then the factor is the P/A of 8 yrs at 5%. This is 6.463. If the company wishes to know the future worth of these benefits; then the factors is the F/A of 8 yrs at 5%; which is 9.549. The former gives a NPB of $16,157.50, while the latter gives a future value of $23,872.50. These scenarios are extremely simple in nature, and do not reflect the reality of most industrial situations. Thus, an engineer must begin to factor in costs and benefits, then find the worth of the proposed machine, expansion, or facility. =Depreciation and Valuation = The fact that assets and material in the real world eventually wear down, and thence break, is a situation that must be accounted for. Depreciation itself is defined by the decreasing of value of any given asset, though some exceptions do exist. Valuation can be considered the basis for depreciation in a basic sense, as any decrease in value would be based on an original value. The idea and existence of depreciation becomes especially relevant to engineering and project management is the fact that capital equipment and assets used in operations will slowly decrease in worth, which will also coincide with an increase in the likelihood of machine failure. Hence the recording and calculation of depreciation is important for two major reasons. # To give an estimate of \\"recovery capital\\" that has been put back into the property. # To enable depreciation to be charged against profits that, like other costs, can be used for income taxation purposes. Both of these reasons, however, cannot make up for the \\"fleeting\\" nature of depreciation, which make direct analysis somewhat difficult. To further add to the issues associated with depreciation, it must be broken down into three separate types, each having intricate calculations and implications. * Normal depreciation, due to physical or functional losses. * Price depreciation, due to changes in market value. * Depletion, due to the use of all available resources. Calculation of depreciation also comes in a number of forms; straight line, declining balance, sum-of-the-year's, and service output. The first method being perhaps the easiest to calculate, while the remaining have varying levels of difficulty and utility. Most situations faced by managers in regards to depreciation can be solved using any of these formulas, however, company policy or preference of individual may affect the choice of model. The main form of depreciation used inside the U.S. is the Modified Accelerated Capital Recovery System (MACRS), and it is based on a number of tables that give the class of asset, and its life. Certain classes are given certain lifespans, and these affect the value of an asset that can be depreciated each year. This does not necessarily mean that an asset must be discarded after its MACRS life is fulfilled, just that it can no longer be used for tax deductions. = Capital Budgeting = Capital budgeting, in relation to engineering economics, is the proper usage and utilization of capital to achieve project objectives. It can be fully defined by the statement; \\"... as the series of decisions by individuals and firms concerning how much and where resources will be obtained and expended to meet future objectives.\\" This definition almost perfectly explains capital and its general relation to engineering, though some special cases may not lend themselves to such a concise explanation. The actual acquisition of that capital has many different routes, from equity to bonds to retained profits, each having unique strengths and weakness, especially when in relation to income taxation. Factors such as risk of capital loss, along with possible or expected returns must also be considered when capital budgeting is underway. For example, if a company has $20,000 to invest in a number of high, moderate, and low risk projects, the decision would depend upon how much risk the company is willing to take on, and if the returns offered by each category offset this perceived risk. Continuing with this example, if the high risk offered only 20% return, while the moderate offered 19% return, engineers and managers would most likely choose the moderate risk project, as its return is far more favorable for its category. The high risk project failed to offer proper returns to warrant its risk status. A more difficult decision may be between a moderate risk offering 15% while a low risk offering 11% return. The decision here would be much more subject to factors such as company policy, extra available capital, and possible investors. > \\"In general, the firm should estimate the project opportunities, including > investment requirements and prospective rates of return for each, expected > to be available for the coming period. Then the available capital should be > tentatively allocated to the most favorable projects. The lowest prospective > rate of return within the capital available then becomes the minimum > acceptable rate of return for analyses of any projects during that period.\\" = Minimum Cost Formulas = Being one of the most important and integral operations in the engineering economic field is the minimization of cost in systems and processes. Time, resources, labor, and capital must all be minimized when placed into any system, so that revenue, product, and profit can be maximized. Hence, the general equation; C=ax +b/x+k where C is total cost, a b and k are constants, and x is the variable number of units produced. There are a great number of cost analysis formulas, each for particular situations and are warranted by the policies of the company in question, or the preferences of the engineer at hand. = Economic Studies, both Private and Public in Nature = Economic studies, which are much more common outside of engineering economics, are still used from time to time to determine feasibility and utility of certain projects. They do not, however, truly reflect the \\"common notion\\" of economic studies, which is fixated upon macroeconomics, something engineers have little interaction with. Therefore, the studies conducted in engineering economics are for specific companies and limited projects inside those companies. At most one may expect to find some feasibility studies done by private firms for the government or another business, but these again are in stark contrast to the overarching nature of true economic studies. Studies have a number of major steps that can be applied to almost every type of situation, those being as follows; * Planning and screening - Mainly reviewing objectives and issues that may be encountered. * Reference to standard economic studies - Consultation of standard forms. * Estimating - Speculating as to the magnitude of costs and other variables. * Reliability - The ability to properly estimate. * Comparison between actual and projected performance - Verify savings, review failures, to ensure that proposals were valid, and to add to future studies. * Objectivity of the analyst - To ensure the individual that advanced proposals or conducted analysis was not biased toward certain outcomes.

A combined force of U.S. Army Soldiers, U.S. Marines, U.S. Navy SEALs, and Iraqi Security Forces fought insurgents for control of key locations in Ramadi, including the Government Centre which was held by 1st Bn 6th Marines bravo company and the General Hospital. Coalition strategy relied on establishing a number of patrol bases called Combat Operation Posts throughout the city which many where manned by other elements of 1st Bn 6th Marines and some from the army on the outer parts of the city. U.S. military officers believe that insurgent actions during the battle led to the formation of the Anbar Awakening. In August, insurgents executed a tribal sheik who was encouraging his kinsmen to join the Iraqi police and prevented his body from being buried in accordance with Islamic laws. In response, Sunni sheiks banded together to drive insurgents from Ramadi. In September 2006, Sheik Abdul Sattar Abu Risha formed the Anbar Salvation Council, an alliance of approximately 40 Sunni tribes. U.S. Navy SEAL Michael A. Monsoor was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for actions during the battle. On September 29, 2006, he threw himself upon a grenade which threatened the lives of the other members of his team. Monsoor had previously been awarded the Silver Star in May for rescuing an injured comrade in the city. The battle also marked the first use of chlorine bombs by insurgents during the war. On October 21, 2006, insurgents detonated a car-bomb with two 100-pound chlorine tanks, injuring three Iraqi policemen and a civilian in Ramadi. Background Since the fall of Fallujah in 2004, Ramadi had been the center of the insurgency in Iraq. The Islamic State of Iraq, a front group for al-Qaeda in Iraq, had declared the city to be its capital. The city of 500,000, located 110 kilometres west of Baghdad, had been under the control of the insurgency except for a few places where the Marines had set up remote outposts, that were virtually under siege. Law and order had broken down, and street battles were common. p.262 Prelude On April 17, 2006, the second Battle of Ramadi began. A sophisticated and aggressive attack was launched by insurgents attacking Observation Post Virginia, the Government Center, the Snake Pit Outpost, and Camp Ramadi all simultaneously by forces led by Abu Musab al- Zarqawi. OP Virginia was the target of a heavily armed vehicle-born suicide bomber. The suicide bomber drove an armored yellow dump truck loaded with approximately one thousand pounds of explosives through the gate of the outpost and detonated it. Insurgents with small arms and RPGs then moved in on the post; a major firefight ensued. The Marines of Lima Company, 3rd Battalion 8th Marines, eventually repelled the attack, killing dozens of insurgents with few Marine casualties. Simultaneously, the Government Center defended by Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines, had repelled insurgents trying to infiltrate the government compound and kidnap the Governor. On or before April 25, 2006, Marines of Kilo Company raided a location that had CDs with videos showing the attack on OP Virginia and of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi planning the attack, which bore the logo of the organization of the Mujahideen Shura Council (Iraq). The videos were subsequently released. Marines during an operation to prevent and disrupt insurgency activity in Ramadi, April 25, 2006 On June 14, U.S. and Iraqi forces in Baghdad began Operation Together Forward, an operation intended to curb the sectarian killings in the capital. In early June 2006, the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 1st U.S. Armored Division and elements from the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division were deployed to the Ramadi area from Tal Afar and Kuwait respectively and began preparations to take on the insurgents in the capital of Al Anbar province, Ramadi. Word of an offensive already gotten to the 400,000 citizens of the city who feared another Fallujah style attack. But the U.S. commander of 1/1 AD, Colonel Sean MacFarland (who later went on to command Operation Inherent Resolve in 2015) decided to take it slowly and softly, without using heavy close air support, artillery or tank fire. By June 10, U.S. troops had \\"cordoned off\\" the city. U.S. airstrikes on residential areas were escalating, and US troops took to the streets with loudspeakers to warn civilians of a fierce impending attack. The objective of the operation was to cut off resupply and reinforcements to the insurgents in Ramadi by gaining control of the key entry points into the city. U.S. forces also planned to establish new combat outposts (COPs) and patrol bases throughout the city, moving off their forward operating bases in order to engage the population and establish relationships with local leaders. On June 7, through intelligence tracking, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi was located and killed by US Forces in a precision-guided bomb strike outside of Baghdad along with five other insurgents. By June 17, there were several skirmishes with the insurgents which killed two American soldiers. =Insurgents attack Ramadi Government Center= US troops take cover from small arms fire while investigating a car bomb explosion in Tameem, Ramadi, August 10, 2006. The operation had some initial success but the effect that the Americans wanted to achieve did not happen. Very soon the American forces were bogged down in heavy street fighting throughout the city. Insurgents launched hit and run attacks on the newly established outposts, which were sometimes assaulted by as many as 100 insurgents at a time. In a major battle on July 24, Al-Qaeda and Saddam Loyalist forces sustained heavy casualties when they launched complexed attacks on every American outpost throughout the city. The main target throughout the campaign was the Ramadi Government Center which was garrisoned by U.S. Marines of Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines who had sandbagged and barricaded the building, along with two combat outposts (India Co. 3/8 and Lima Co. 3/8) that the enemy thought to be understrengthed in which they could capture the Americans and kill all inside. Both combat outposts engaged in a 5-6 hour defensive fight, a barrage of mortars, reinforcements could not reach the Government Center and the two outposts because the enemy set up ambushes to block reinforcements. Regardless, Marines continued to fight and hold their positions and repulsed the attack. In an attempt to reduce future attacks, U.S. Marines demolished several buildings around the government center in order to deny the enemy closer proximity access and the ease of movement to stage. Roadside bomb attacks and ambushes of patrols on the streets happened nearly every time the Marines went outside the wire. Sniper attacks were also a constant threat to Marines during the battle. There were also several suicide-bombing attacks on the outposts. One insurgent sniper had used the fourth story of the Ramadi General Hospital to kill a number of Marines before he was counter-sniped by a Marine Sniper from 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines. =Ramadi General Hospital Captured= Iraqi police prepare to enter the Ramadi hospital, July 5, 2006. At the beginning of July, a combined Marine, Naval Special Warfare, and Iraqi Force, supported by the U.S. Army, managed to push deep enough into the city to reach the Ramadi General Hospital, and it was captured by the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment on 5 July 2006. The Marines reported through verified evidence that members of al-Qaeda in Iraq had been using the seven- story building, which was equipped with some 250 beds, to treat their wounded and fire on U.S. troops in the area. The Marines said there were wounded Iraqi Police Officers who had been taken to the hospital and were later found beheaded. Though there was no resistance during the operation, the Marines found about a dozen triggering devices for roadside bombs hidden above the tiled ceiling of one office. They knocked down dozens of locked doors and searched medicine chests and storage closets for additional weapons. At the conclusion of the operation, American Forces took heavy sniper fire from insurgents that slipped away. Hospitals and mosques are considered off-limits in traditional warfare (except that it loses protected status when it is used to shoot from, for example). In western Ramadi, however, insurgents had repeatedly fired on Marines from the rooftop of a Women and Children's Hospital so often that patients were moved to a wing with fewer exposed windows. =Formation of the Anbar Awakening Council= Sheikh Abdul Sittar speaks with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno, commander of Multi-National Corps - Iraq at Camp Ramadi, April 2, 2007. Sheikh Sittar helped spark the Anbar Awakening Movement. On August 21, insurgents killed Abu Ali Jassim, a Sunni sheikh who had encouraged many of his tribesmen to join the Iraqi Police. The insurgents hid the body in a field rather than returning it for a proper burial, violating Islamic law and angering Jassim's tribesmen. Following this, 40 sheikhs from 20 tribes from across Al Anbar organised a movement called the Sahwa Al Anbar (Anbar Awakening). On September 9, Sheikh Sittar organised a tribal council attended by over fifty sheikhs and Col. Sean MacFarland. During this council, Sittar officially declared the Anbar Awakening underway. p.48 Shortly after the council, the tribes began attacking al-Qaeda in Iraq insurgents in the suburbs of Ramadi. By October, nearly every tribe in northern and western Ramadi had joined the awakening. p.49 By December, attacks had dropped 50% according to the U.S. military. =September‚ÄìOctober= In mid-September 2006, the 1st Battalion, 6th Marines (\\"1/6\\") relieved the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines in western Ramadi. The battalion commander, Lt. Col. Jurney, deployed his companies throughout the city. Alpha Company was deployed to OP VA, a combat outpost close to a large seven-story building. Bravo Company took up position in the Ramadi Government Center and Charlie Company was deployed to OP Hawk, the main combat outpost around Ramadi General Hospital.http://www.marines.mil/units/marforpac/imef/Pages/2007/The%20purpose%20and%20effect%20of%20Observation%20Post%20Hawk.aspx Delta Force operators from Task Force Green and DEVGRU operators from Task Force Blue mounted takedown operations against al-Qaeda targets based on high- level intelligence. In late September, Pentagon officials announced that the troops of the 1st brigade, 1st Armored Division would have their tour extended by 46 days. This extension was ordered to give the relieving brigade, the 1st brigade, 3rd Infantry Division time to prepare for their deployment at the start of 2007. In mid-October, 1/6 conducted its first major offensive, taking the large building on 17th Street in the Jumaiyah neighborhood where they established the 17th Street Security Station. This was the first joint Marine- Iraqi outpost in the city.http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/shared- blogs/ajc/georgiansatwar/entries/2007/04/18/georgia_marines_bond_together.html In mid-October, al-Qaeda announced the creation of Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), with Ramadi as its capital replacing the Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC) and its al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). =November incident= During heavy fighting between November 13 and November 15, U.S. forces were alleged to have killed at least 30 people, including women and children, in an airstrike in central Ramadi. Interviews by an unnamed Los Angeles Times correspondent in Ramadi supported eyewitness statements that there were civilian deaths during the fighting. Residents said the houses in an old Iraqi army officers quarters had been destroyed, including one being used as an Internet cafe. News photos showed bodies of civilians allegedly killed by coalition forces. A Marine spokesman disputed the account, saying that an airstrike on November 14 targeted a bridge east of Ramadi and there were many insurgent casualties in the attack. He said that on the 13th and 14th, Coalition forces killed 16 suspected insurgents, who had been placing IEDs and firing mortars and RPGs, in fighting in three separate incidents in Ramadi. At least one U.S. soldier was also killed in the fighting. The spokesman did not respond to inquiries about the number of civilian deaths, but he admitted that it was often difficult for coalition forces to distinguish between insurgents and civilians and did not confirm or deny that some collateral damage may have occurred. He neither responded to inquiries made by The Times regarding the number of homes destroyed or tank rounds fired in the fighting. Aftermath By mid-November at least 75 American soldiers and Marines were killed along with an unknown number of Iraqi soldiers and police. The U.S. commander, Col. MacFarland said 750 insurgents had been killed in fighting in Ramadi and that his forces had secured 70% of the city. The intense battles of October and November 2006 largely eliminated al-Qaeda from the city, the surviving militants fled, with teams of them turning up in Baghdad and elsewhere, whilst others melted into the population. =The Devlin report= Two years before the battle, in 2004, then commander of the Marine garrison, MajGen James Mattis, stated that, \\"if Ramadi fell the whole province (Al Anbar) goes to hell\\". Two years later, a classified report written by Marine Col. Pete Devlin in August 2006 and leaked to the Washington Post in mid-September 2006, said Al Anbar had been lost and there was almost nothing that could be done. Devlin was the chief Intelligence Officer for the Marine units operating in the province. The report said that not only were military operations facing a stalemate, unable to extend and sustain security beyond the perimeters of their bases, but also local governments in the province had collapsed and the weak central government had almost no presence. On November 28, 2006 another part of the classified Marine Corps intelligence report was published by The Washington Post which said US forces could neither crush the insurgency in western Iraq nor counter the rising popularity of the al-Qaeda terrorist network in the area. According to the report, \\"the social and political situation has deteriorated to a point that US and Iraqi troops are no longer capable of militarily defeating the insurgency in al-Anbar.\\" The report describes al-Qaeda in Iraq as the \\"dominant organization of influence\\" in the province, more important than local authorities, the Iraqi government and US troops \\"in its ability to control the day-to-day life of the average Sunni.\\" =Operation Squeeze Play= Insurgents still remained well entrenched in the city with coalition forces continuing combat operations throughout November and December. On November 28, 2006 six civilians, including five Iraqi girls, were killed when a U.S. tank fired into a building from which two insurgents were firing upon U.S. soldiers. On December 1, 2006, a 900-strong task force centered around the 1st Battalion, 37th Armored Regiment (1-37) launched a month-long operation known as Operation Squeeze Play targeting the \\"Second Officers District\\" in central Ramadi. On December 6, six American soldiers were killed in heavy street fighting. Three of these, two soldiers and a Marine, were killed in an area of western Ramadi controlled by the Abu Alwan tribe, which was aligned with the Awakening movement. According to Col. MacFarland, the tribe saw the killings as a personal attack by the insurgents against their tribe and killed or captured all of the insurgents involved in the attack within ten days. By the end of the operation on January 14, 2007, US forces had killed 44 insurgents and captured a further 172. Four additional Iraqi police stations were established during the operation, which brought the total to 14. =Marine reserve force committed= In mid-November 2006, 2,200 Marines from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (15th MEU), a reserve force on ships in the Persian Gulf, deployed to Al Anbar as reinforcements. This force included members of Battalion Landing Team 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment who were sent by General Abizaid to help in the fighting in Ramadi. In January 2007, as part of the U.S. troop surge in Iraq, 4,000 Marines in Al Anbar had their tour extended by 45 days. The order included the 15th MEU and 1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment fighting in Ramadi, as well as the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment fighting elsewhere in Al Anbar. =1-9 Infantry Regiment (Manchu): Operation Murfreesboro and East Ramadi= Captured insurgents This operation was one of the closing engagements of the Battle of Ramadi in 2006. In the beginning months of 2007, Task Force 1-9, comprising 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment (1-9 IN, part of 2ID), with support from Abrams main battle tanks of the 3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment (3-69 AR), Navy SEALS, Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV) and dismounted infantry from 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment (1-26 IN), Charlie Company of the 321st Engineer Battalion, Lima Company of 3rd Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment (3/6 Marines), and infantrymen from the veteran Iraqi Army 1st Brigade, launched an offensive in East Ramadi named Operation Murfreesboro. The operation was intended to cut off Mal'ab District from the rest of Ramadi in order to drive out the al-Qaedah forces operating with near impunity there. The operation began February 20, 2007, when tanks and IFVs from 3-69th Armor and 1-26th Infantry set up a full cordon around Mal'ab District, preventing any movement in or out of the neighborhood. Once this was in place, the soldiers of the 9th Infantry Regiment began conducting clearing operations and targeted raids searching for weapons, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), enemy fighters, and high-level al-Qaedah leadership within Mal'ab District and the neighboring Iskaan district, supported by the aforementioned armored vehicles, Apache helicopters, and long range rockets (GMLRS). Throughout February 2007, there were more than 40 separate engagements with al-Qaeda forces, 8 large weapons caches found, more than 20 IEDs used against US and Iraqi Army forces, more than 50 IEDs located and safely disposed of, 69 enemy fighters killed in action, 9 known enemy wounded, and 32 enemy fighters captured. Together with the Iraqi Army, the local police force began to conduct patrols with gradually lessened support from coalition forces. Operation Murfreesboro is widely credited with breaking the back of the insurgency in Anbar Province, as it fed the fire of the Anbar Awakening, which saw almost the entirety of Anbar province turn on the insurgency, in favor of the new Iraqi government in Baghdad. Coupled with further gains in recruiting the local leaders and militias in the surrounding areas, Anbar Province required very little assistance during the famous \\"surge\\" that took place later in 2007. The improvement was so great that it enabled Task Force 1-9 (now operating without the armored and mechanized support it had enjoyed in the early part of 2007) to send nearly 70% of its strength to assist other units in clearing the city of Taji, just north of Baghdad, in October 2007. The 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment received the Navy Unit Commendation for this battle, and was recommended for a Valorous Unit Award. =\\"Raider\\" Brigade takes over Ramadi= In January 2007, the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, on its third tour to Iraq, arrived in Ramadi and assumed responsibility from MacFarland's brigade on February 18 at a transfer ceremony at Camp Ramadi. During the ceremony, which was attended by Sheikh Sattar, MacFarland said that his brigade had lost 86 soldiers, sailors and Marines during the 8-month campaign (though the Brigade had spent a total of nearly 17 months in Iraq). In January 2007, Ramadi averaged approximately 35 enemy attacks on US forces per day. Following heavy fighting over an 8-week campaign, which was led by a Task Force commanded by 1st Brigade, 3rd ID, also known as Task Force Raider, attacks in the brigade's area of operations dropped to one or two per day within the city of Ramadi. In the early months of 2007, 3-69 Armor Battalion, in conjunction with two Marine Battalions, along with TF PathFinder was largely responsible for securing Southern and Central Ramadi. By August 2007, Ramadi had gone 80 consecutive days without a single attack on US forces and the 1st BDE, 3rd ID commander, Colonel John Charlton, stated, \\"...al-Qaeda is defeated in Al Anbar\\". However, despite 1-3 ID's effectiveness, insurgents continued to launch attacks on Ramadi and the surrounding areas in the weeks and months to follow. On June 30, 2007, a group of between 50 and 60 insurgents attempting to infiltrate Ramadi were intercepted and destroyed, following a tip from Iraqi Police officers. The insurgents were intercepted by elements of the 1st Battalion, 77th Armor on 30 June 2007 and on 1 July 2007 they were destroyed by elements of Bravo company, 2nd Squad, 1st platoon, 1-18 Infantry Regiment. 1-18 operated out of the Ta'Meem district of Ramadi's western sector. North of Ramadi, elements of 3-69 Armor, whose headquarters had been moved north of Ramadi, engaged elements of al-Qaeda in Iraq who had taken refuge in rural areas north of the city. After several counter-insurgency operations, 3-69 AR Battalion and 1st Battalion 8th Marines effectively removed Al Qaeda in Iraq from the greater Anbar province. By March 2008, Ramadi, Iraq had become a vastly safer city than it had been only a year before and the number of enemy attacks in the city had fallen drastically. Years later, by mid-2012, Ramadi remained far safer than it had been since 2003. =Iraqi police development= One major shortcoming in the efforts to wrest control of Ramadi from the insurgency was the failure of the Iraqi Police to effectively combat the insurgency. As part of the Tribal Engagement Strategy, Ready First developed and implemented a plan to quickly recruit, train, and employ Iraqi policemen on the streets of Ramadi. COL MacFarland, and LTC James Lechner, Deputy Brigade Commander, successfully developed an Iraqi Police recruiting, training, and employment plan that was implemented by HHC, 2-152 Infantry (Mech), an Army National Guard unit that lived in Iraqi police stations and Combat Outposts conducting daily patrols and clearing operations with their counterparts. HHC, 2-152 Infantry, also known in Ramadi as \\"the 152nd\\", or the Police Transition Team (PTT) Company would provide the Iraqi Police in Ramadi with the leadership and oversight that proved crucial in re-establishing a police presence in Ramadi to ensure insurgent forces did not return to neighborhoods that had been secured. Consequently, the success of the Iraqi Police program in Ramadi convinced the Ramadi populace that their government could effectively provide for their security needs, a critical element of defeating the insurgency. The 152nd PTT Company's Iraqi Police efforts began in October 2006 and would continue through the departure of Ready First and into the tenure of 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division until the 152nd departed in October 2007. The 152nd was responsible for recruiting, training, and conducting patrols with hundreds of Iraqi Police, and opened several new Iraqi police stations in the city of Ramadi.

Villard and James Nagel. The film stars Sandra Bullock, Chris O'Donnell, Mackenzie Astin, and Margot Steinberg. Its action takes place during the First World War and is based on the wartime experiences of the writer Ernest Hemingway. It was directed by Richard Attenborough. The film was entered into the 47th Berlin International Film Festival. This film is largely based on Hemingway's real-life experiences in the First World War as a young ambulance-driver in Italy. He was wounded and sent to a military hospital, where he shared a room with Villard (who later wrote the book the movie is based on) and they were nursed by Agnes von Kurowsky. Hemingway and Kurowsky fell strongly in love, but somehow the relationship didn't work out. The film‚Äîapparently in a deliberate attempt to capture what the director called Hemingway's \\"emotional intensity\\"‚Äîtakes liberties with the facts. In real life, unlike the movie, the relationship was probably never consummated, and the couple did not meet again after Hemingway left Italy. Hemingway, deeply affected by his romantic relationship with Kurowsky, later wrote several stories about it, including A Farewell to Arms. Plot In Italy during World War I, the president of the United States has sendt teams of Red Cross doctors and nurses to boost Italian morale and help care for the wounded. Volunteers drive ambulances and work in the front line canteens. Ernest Hemingway (Chris O'Donnell) a 19-year-old boy, becomes an ambulance driver in Italy, although he wishes to become a reporter and writer. In an attempt to fight against the enemy, he ends up with a broken leg, trying to save a companion from the field. He is taken into a hospital, where an American nurse, Agnes von Kurowsky (Sandra Bullock) takes care of him. During the first night at the hospital, Ernest tells Agnes \\"i love you. Let's get married\\", while in a state of delirium. Ernest's health becomes worse and Agnes tries everything to save his leg from what she believes is gangrene. A successful operation returns Ernest to a path of recovery. As time passes by, the two become attached, even though Agnes has reservations about the affair because of their difference in age. Ernest becomes more and more attracted to the nurse as his health slowly returns. Eventually, Agnes and some other nurses need to be moved closer to the front. Because she can't find Ernest to tell him the bad news in person, she asks her friend to send him a letter. Ernest is shocked at finding out that she has left. While working on the front, Agnes receives a letter from Ernest telling her how much he misses her presence. After a few days, Ernest is finally able to visit Agnes, telling her that he has received new orders, which say he must return to the United States. He confesses his love for Agnes, asking her to meet him at a nearby hotel in order to spend their remaining time together and to promise each other daily letters, until they are able to get married. After some time spent on the front, Agnes is asked by one of the nurses, a good friend with her, to spend the weekend at their doctor's house, Dr. Domenico Caracciolo, who seems to have feelings for Agnes. The three of them spend quality time together, the doctor showing them the surroundings of Venice. The letters from Agnes soon become less and less frequent, causing Ernest great concern. While showing her an unfinished hospital, Dr. Domenico proposes to Agnes. She hesitates, still thinking of Ernest. She decides to write him a difficult letter, telling him that their relationship must end, one of the reasons being the age gap between them. Ernest is devastated by this awful announcement. Eight months later, in New York, Agnes meets an old friend and ex-patient, Harry. She confesses that she did not marry the doctor and finds out that Ernest is still angry at her. She decides to go to Ernest's old cabin, near Lake Warloon. Still angry and proud, Ernest doesn't accept that their love story is over. The film ends with Agnes telling him \\"i love you\\" as she leaves the cabin, never to see him again.

The website's consensus reads, \\"Formulaic and trite, In Love and War unconvincingly recreates Ernest Hemingway's early life with all the stuffy tropes that the author would have excised in a second draft.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 out of 4 and wrote: \\"In Love and War is not much interested in Ernest Hemingway's subsequent life and career, and even in its treatment of this early period, it doesn't deal with themes such as his macho posturing, his need to prove himself, his grandiosity.\\" Stephen Holden in The New York Times called the film \\"a generic historical romance and older woman-younger man fable of sexual initiation too muted for either character to come to life\\".

It is one of the rarest plants in the world, being extinct in the wild with all specimens being clones of the type. The specific and common name both honour John Medley Wood, curator of the Durban Botanic Garden and director of the Natal Government Herbarium of South Africa, who discovered the plant in 1895. Description The bark of the specimen planted in Kirstenbosch botanical garden. Cone of Encephalartos woodii It is palm tree like, and can reach a height of . The trunk is about in diameter, thickest at the bottom, and topped by a crown of 50‚Äì150 leaves. The leaves are glossy and dark green, in length, and keeled with 70‚Äì150 leaflets, the leaflets falcate (sickle- shaped), long and broad. E. woodii is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, however no female plant has ever been discovered. The male strobili are cylindrical, long, exceptionally up to , and in diameter; they are a vivid yellow-orange colour. A single plant may bear from around six to eight simultaneously. Taxonomy Portion of a leaf showing leaflets Encephalartos woodii was first described by Wood as a variety of E. altensteinii (as E. altensteinii var. bispinna), and raised to the rank of species in 1908 by the English horticulturalist Henry Sander from studying a specimen in his collection, which was apparently one of the basal offsets taken from the original clump. It has been considered that Encephalartos woodii is most closely related to E. natalensis. Some authorities consider E. woodii to not be a true species but rather a mutant E. natalensis or a relic of some other species. Yet others consider this plant to be a natural hybrid between E. natalensis and E. ferox. To determine the relationship between E. natalensis and E. woodii, the RAPD technique was used to generate genetic fingerprints and data analysed using distance methods. Based on RAPD fingerprints, the intraspecific genetic variation among different E. natalensis plants is similar to the interspecific variation between E. natalensis and E. woodii, which confirms the close relationship between E. natalensis and E. woodii.Viljoen, C.D. & van Staden, J. The genetic relationship between Encephalartos natalensis and E. woodii determined using RAPD fingerprinting.

In a 1907 expedition, Wylie collected two of the larger stems and noted that of the remaining two, one of them (the largest of the four original stems) was badly mutilated and he did not expect it to survive. By 1912 there was only one tall trunk left in the wild, and in 1916, the Forestry Department arranged to have it removed and sent to the Government Botanist in Pretoria. It is thought that this trunk subsequently died in 1964. =Current distribution= These plants are currently distributed in various botanical institutions around the world. Two of the larger trunks that Wylie collected in the 1907 expedition are still to be seen in the Durban Botanic Gardens. A sucker from one of the Durban Botanic Gardens plants was sent to Kirstenbosch near Cape Town, South Africa in 1916 by James Wylie.

The specimen in Ireland at Glasnevin is said to be \\"probably the tallest\\" specimen of E. woodii in Europe. Conservation status Despite numerous excursions in the oNgoye-Mtunzini area, no other specimens of Encephalartos woodii have ever been found. All known specimens of Encephalartos woodii are clones of the only known male plant which was completely removed from the wild. For these reasons, the plant is considered extinct in the wild. =Legislation= As is the case with all members of the genus Encephalartos, Encephalartos woodii is protected by both national and international legislation: In South Africa one requires a permit from Nature Conservation to move, sell, buy, donate, receive, cultivate and sell Endangered Flora and to own adult cycads. On an international level all species and hybrids of Encephalartos are on Appendix I of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. This means that wild collected material may not be traded and for each and every artificially cultivated Encephalartos plant or piece of a plant or a cone or pollen or seed, being carried over an international border requires a CITES Export Permit issued by the authority of the exporting country, and a CITES Import Permit issued by the authority of the importing country. Reproduction and propagation Offshoots (suckers) showing roots developing on the largest oneA female E. natalensis x woodii with cones =Vegetative reproduction= Encephalartos woodii reproduces with rapidly growing suckers. =Sexual reproduction= Unless a female plant is found, E. woodii will never reproduce naturally. This species is known to form fertile hybrids with E. natalensis, and a backcrossing technique can be used: if each offspring is subsequently crossed with E. woodii and the process is then repeated, after several generations, female offspring will be closer to what a female Encephalartos woodii would be like. However, genetic analysis of chloroplast DNA of F1 hybrids between E. woodii and E. natalensis showed that all chloroplasts are inherited from the female E. natalensis,Cafasso, D. et al. (2001). Maternal inheritance of plastids in Encephalartos Lehm.

It was directed by Lloyd French, produced by Hal Roach and distributed by MGM. Plot The film is set in the home of a mad scientist called Professor Noodle. Professor Noodle has just developed a rejuvenation solution that reverses the aging process. Stan and Oliver are chimney sweeps and arrive to sweep the chimney. Oliver goes on to the roof and Stan stays below at the fireplace. Stan begins to shove the sweep up the chimney and knocks Oliver backwards and down through the skylight. Oliver comes back on to the roof and begins to pull the sweep up. Stan has hung on to the sweep and arrives at the roof. Oliver drops him back down through the chimney. Stan doesn't have enough extensions for the sweep and decides to use a rifle to shove the sweep the last part of the way. The gun goes off nearly shooting Oliver. Stan decides to go up to the roof and as he opens the skylight he knocks Oliver off the roof and down onto a greenhouse. Hardy finally falls down the chimney dislodging many bricks, sending a cloud of soot all over the living room and onto the butler, and damaging the piano. The butler says something about an electric chair, and stalks out. Stan and Oliver start to clean up the soot around the fireplace. They become distracted and Stan shovels the soot into Oliver's trousers. Professor Noodle decides to test his rejuvenation solution. He puts a duck in a vat of water and adds a drop of his solution. The water agitates for a few seconds, and the duck turns into a duckling. The professor is excited and decides to show Stan and Oliver his discovery. He puts another drop of his solution into the vat, the water again froths and swirls briefly, and the duckling turns into an egg. Stan and Oliver decide to test the solution for themselves when the professor leaves the room to fetch and rejuvenate the butler. As Oliver is leaning over the vat with a huge beaker of the rejuvenation solution and an eyedropper, Stan accidentally knocks Oliver and the container of solution into the vat. After churning and gurgling tumultuously for some moments as the excessively-large amount of solution and water mix (accompanied by agonized screams and whooping yowls from Oliver), the vat eventually settles back down, and Oliver emerges as a chimpanzee. Stan plaintively asks if Ollie still knows him and will speak to him. Despite being \\"rejuvenated\\" ‚Äî-- de-evolved, even --‚Äî into a \\"basic primate\\" by the massive overdose of the solution, Oliver is still able to say what he has said multiple times throughout the film, \\"I have nothing to say\\".

It closes its tentacles to capture prey or to protect itself. It is a deep ocean species. Distribution Actinoscyphia aurelia This sea anemone is found in muddy situations at bathyal depths in deep water canyons in the Gulf of Mexico. It has also been observed at several sites in the upwelling region off the coast of West Africa as well as the American Samoan region of the Pacific, but is uncommon elsewhere. Biology Venus flytrap sea anemone is a passive suspension feeder, and orients itself on its often slender column so that it faces the upwelling current. Its pedal disc is small, and its tentacles are short compared to the large, concave oral disc, which is funnel or mushroom- shaped. It extends its tentacles in two rows, one reflexed back and one sloping forward, and collects food particles as they drift past. Although usually considered sessile, the Venus flytrap sea anemone sometimes moves, particularly as a juvenile. During deep water research off Cap Blanc, Mauritania, at depths between , the Venus flytrap sea anemone and the irregular sea urchin Pourtalesia miranda were found to dominate the benthic community. In 2004 a mass mortality event occurred adjoining an oil pipeline off the Ivory Coast. Large numbers of the tunicate Pyrosoma atlanticum were involved, the moribund carcasses sinking to the seabed and accumulating in canyons and by the pipeline. Species of megafauna found feeding on the gelatinous detritus varied by depth. At a depth of few fish were present, but Venus flytrap sea anemones were numerous. Other scavenging invertebrates at this depth included the sea anemone Actinostola sp., the sea pen Pennatula sp., the sea urchins Phormosoma sp., Mesothuria sp. and Ophiolepadidae, the penaeid shrimp Parapenaeus sp. and the sea spider Colossendeis sp.

At various times the television series appeared on all three major television networks, while the radio version was broadcast on two separate networks and on two separate coasts. Ford Theatre was named for its sponsor, the Ford Motor Company, which had an earlier success with its concert music series, The Ford Sunday Evening Hour (1934‚Äì42). Radio Ford Theater as a radio series lasted for only two seasons. Its first season was broadcast from New York City on NBC with such actors as Ed Begley, Shirley Booth, Gary Merrill, Everett Sloane and Vicki Vola. This season ran from October 5, 1947, to June 27, 1948. Due to poor ratings, Ford moved the show to Hollywood and CBS for the second season, where top Hollywood actors headed the casts. This season, which lasted from October 8, 1948, to July 1, 1949, received much higher ratings. However, with television rising in popularity, Ford decided to end its radio show and focus solely on television. Television The first Ford Theatre on U.S. television appeared on October 17, 1948, near the beginning of regularly scheduled prime time network programming. It was an hour-long drama, broadcast live, as was most television of the era. This series used primarily Broadway actors. The program began as a monthly series, switching to biweekly a year later, in alternation on Friday nights at 9:00 pm Eastern time with the 54th Street Revue. During this period, programming included adaptations of Little Women, with June Lockhart and Kim Hunter, and One Sunday Afternoon, with Burgess Meredith and Hume Cronyn. During the following season, the final season for the program on CBS, the alternation in the same time slot was with Magnavox Theater. A half-hour filmed Ford Theatre returned to the airwaves on NBC for the 1951‚Äì52 season on Thursday nights at 9:30 pm Eastern. At this time, production was moved from New York to Hollywood, and featured actors based there rather than on Broadway. Some of these programs were comedies instead of dramas. Performers appearing during this era included Frank Bank, Scott Brady, Claudette Colbert, Charles Coburn, Ed Hinton, Vivi Janiss, Peter Lawford, Sam Levene, Ida Lupino, Thomas Mitchell, Dennis Morgan, Karen Sharpe, Ann Sheridan, Barry Sullivan, and Beverly Washburn. Also appearing for the first time together were Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis, in an episode entitled \\"First Born,\\" which first aired on February 3, 1953. In October 1954, Ford Theatre became the first network television series to be filmed regularly in color.\\"Television in Review\\", The New York Times, August 11, 1954, p. 33. During this period, Ford Theatre finished in the Nielsen ratings at number 30 for the 1952‚Äì1953 season, number seven in 1953‚Äì1954, number 9 in 1954‚Äì1955, and number 13 in 1955‚Äì1956.http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/index.htm After four seasons on NBC, the program was shown for a final season on ABC during the 1956‚Äì57 season. The time slot was changed to Wednesdays at 9:30 pm. The last prime time broadcast of Ford Theatre was on July 10, 1957. In 1954, Billboard voted it the best filmed network television drama series.

He was the father of Colombo mobsters Joseph Scopo and Ralph Scopo Jr., and the grandfather of Joseph Scopo Jr. and Ralph Scopo III. Concrete Club Scopo was the president of the Cement and Concrete Workers District Council of the Laborers' International Union of North America from 1977 to April 1985. During this time, Scopo used his position to extort money from cement contractors in New York in return for large construction contracts and labor peace. Contracts between $2 million and $15 million were reserved for a club of contractors called the \\"Concrete Club\\", which were selected by The Commission. In return, the contractors gave a two percent kickback of the contract value to The Commission.\\"U.S. JURY CONVICTS EIGHT AS MEMBERS OF MOB COMMISSION\\" By ARNOLD H. LUBASCH New York Times November 20, 1986 Although Scopo was only a low- ranking soldier, his membership in the Concrete Club allowed him more influence than some capos in the Colombo family. In a recorded conversation with a non-club contractor, Scopo was heard explaining: > Scopo: ... The concrete's gotta be twelve million? > Contractor: Yeah. Why can't I do the concrete? > Scopo: You can't do it. Over two million you can't do it. It's under two > million, hey, me, I tell you go ahead and do it. > Contractor: Who do I gotta go see?

In another recording in April 1984, Scopo tells an associate that the Gambino crime family had murdered capo Roy DeMeo because they feared DeMeo might become a government witness and testify against them. Racketeering convictions In 1980, the FBI initiated Operation Genus against all five of the New York Cosa Nostra families, an effort that would result in the infamous Mafia Commission trial. As part of this investigation, agents placed a remote listening device in Scopo's car. On February 25, 1985, Scopo and other high- ranking Cosa Nostra leaders were indicted on federal racketeering charges. Scopo was specifically charged with extorting $326,000 from a concrete supplier. As a result of the indictment, Scopo was forced to resign from the District Council. Along with the other defendants, Scopo pleaded not guilty on July 1, 1985, in what would become known as the Mafia Commission Trial.\\"11 PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO RULING ORGANIZED CRIME IN NEW YORK\\" New York Times July 2, 1985 On November 14, 1985, the trial was interrupted when Scopo complained of chest pains and was transported to a local hospital.

Not to be confused with \\"rink guards\\". A rink guard is a person who assists skaters and maintains order at public skating sessions. Use in ice hockey They are used in ice hockey to protect the players' skates from damage by surfaces other than ice. They are placed over top the skate blade to cover it. They protect the blades from cement, rocks, metal or wood which can damage the skate blade, resulting in uneven skating, due to rusty and dull blades. The skate guard is obviously not used when on the ice, as the skates will slip from the plastic onto the ice. They can be taken off easily and are the best way to maintain good blade condition for a long time in order to keep skate strides smooth and fast. =Types of skate guards= The most common type of skate guard is a plastic sheath that stays tight on the blades with metal springs. They can be trimmed to fit different sizes of blades. Manufacturers make them in many colors. Another type of skate guard is the centipede guard, which has an elastic loop that fits around the top of the blade to keep the guard on. Use in figure skating Figure skating guards are usually made of plastic with a simple spring or other mechanical device to hold the guards tightly to the blades. They can be found in many colors and with internal lights that blink as the skater walks. They are also called 'blade guards'. Figure skating guards historically were made of wood, but this has been supplanted in the last thirty years by plastic. Safety A common cause of accidents in skating rinks is to forget to remove the skate guard before stepping onto the ice. The skater's feet will slide out from under them, and result in an uncontrolled fall and, potentially, a blow to the head.

BMH rented the original Temple Emanuel building at 19th and Curits for holiday services until it purchased the former home of Temple Emanuel in 1898. The building was severely damaged by fire in 1902. Rabbi Charles Eliezer Hillel Kauvar came to BMH in 1902 and served until 1952. BMH laid the cornerstone of their new building on Rosh Hashanah 1916 and was a major civic event, drawing DU chancellor and former Colorado governor Henry Buchtel, Judge Benjamin Barr Lindsey and former Denver School Superintendent William H. Smiley. The congregation occupied this building until 1966; after BMH left, the building served a variety of uses, falling into increasing disrepair before an extensive remodel in 2008 converted the building into a Messianic Christian church.Tom Noel, \\"Hiding the Heritage of a Building\\", Rocky Mountain News, June 2, 2001 .Andrea Jacobs, \\"Then, BMH; now . . .church in the city\\" , Intermountain Jewish News, November 20, 2008. In 1963, BMH secured at 560 S. Monaco Parkway and the building was completed in 1969. The congregation was a founding member of the United Synagogue of America (now called the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism), the primary organization of American Conservative Judaism. Rabbi Kauvar was the first vice-president of the organization, and BMH remained affiliated with the Conservative movement until 1955, when Rabbi Kauvar (by then serving as the emeritus rabbi) was influential in causing the congregation to leave the United Synagogue. BMH hired its first Orthodox rabbi in 1956.\\"Kauvar, Charles Eliezer Hillel\\", Encyclopaedia Judaica (2nd ed., 2007) . Stanley M.

It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the Alpine ibex. Threats against the species include habitat loss, poaching, and restricted range; only about 500 individuals survived in the mountains of Ethiopia, concentrated in the Semien Mountains, largely due to past poaching and habitat depletion. If the population were to increase, the surrounding mountain habitat would be sufficient to sustain only 2,000 ibex. The adult walia ibex's only known wild predator is the hyena. However, young ibex are often hunted by a variety of fox and cat species. The ibex are members of the goat family, and the walia ibex is the southernmost of today's ibexes. In the late 1990s, the walia ibex went from endangered to critically endangered due to the declining population. The walia ibex is also known as the Abyssinian ibex.  Appearance  R√ºppell's depiction of the species (1835). These animals have a chocolate- brown to chestnut-brown coat coloration, greyish-brown muzzle, and a lighter grey in the eyes and legs. The belly and insides of the legs are white, and black and white patterns stretch upon the legs of these animals. The males weigh 80‚Äì125 kg (180-280 lb) and have very large horns which curve backwards, reaching lengths up to . These horns are used for dominance disputes between males. The males also have distinguished black beards. The length of the walia ibex beard varies with age. The older males have longer, thicker beards than the young ones . Females also have horns, but they are shorter and thinner. Females are smaller and lighter in color. The horns on both males and females are rigid. The overall size of the walia ibex is smaller and slimmer than the alpine ibex.  Behaviour  Walia ibex live in herds ranging from five to 20 animals. However the older, more mature males are often more solitary, though they will remain within a short distance of the main herd most times and during the mating season and rejoin with the herd for breeding purposes. Breeding usually takes place during late fall and early winter. The following spring, the female will give birth to one or two offspring. A herd of walia ibex was noted to travel one half of a kilometer up to two kilometers per day.  Habitat and ecology  The walia ibex lives in very steep, rocky cliff areas between high. Their habitats are mountain forests, subalpine grasslands, and scrub. They are grazers. Their diets include bushes, herbs, lichens, shrubs, grasses, and creepers. They are often seen standing on their hind legs to get to young shoots of giant heath. Walia ibex are most active in the morning and evening, and will rest in the sun on rock ledges. Males live in bachelor groups and females live in groups with their offspring. Mating season is at summit from March to May. Males compete for females by ramming their horns with amazing force. Gestation periods last 150‚Äì165 days. They reach sexual maturity at one year of age.  Threats  This species is only found in the northern mountains of Ethiopia. Once widespread in the Semien Mountains, the numbers dropped during the 20th century. Only 200‚Äì250 animals were surviving in 1994‚Äì1996, but recently the population has somewhat increased to about 500 individuals in 2004. Habitat loss and hunting are major threats to the species. The encroaching settlement, livestock grazing, and cultivation are also big problems. Road construction is also fragmenting their habitat. The most important stronghold for their survival is now the sized Semien National Park which was established in 1969. The Walia ibex is considered to be vulnerable by the IUCN and needs further conservation measures to survive. Since no captive population is kept anywhere in the world, the IUCN recommends capturing a few individuals to form the nucleus of a captive breeding group.

Less regular services also take passengers West to the Hunter Valley as far as Scone and North to Dungog. Thornton is the junction for a colliery branch line leading to the Bloomfield Coal Loop, a balloon loop. A new industrial estate and increased residential subdivisions resulted in the RTA planning a major upgrade to the Weakleys Drive intersection, which was completed as of December 2008. DBT (Australia) opened their new complex here in December 2006.  Education  Thornton has a government primary school of Thornton Primary. It also the main of Aspect Hunter School which offer schooling option for students with autism K-12.

The title word setsuy≈ç means \\"reduce usage; economize\\" and alludes to the Lunyu (compare the Kagakush≈´). \\"Confucius said: 'If you would govern a state of a thousand chariots (a small-to-middle- size state), you must pay strict attention to business, be true to your word, be economical in expenditure and love the people'.\\" (tr. Muller ) The origins of the Setsuy≈çsh≈´ are unclear. The oldest extant edition is dated 1496 CE, and the text was probably compiled shortly before the Bunmei era (1469‚Äì1487 CE). Despite much speculation about the dictionary's anonymous author, Bailey (1960:47) concludes \\"a nameless fifteenth-century Zen priest is the likeliest candidate\\". Unlike many early Japanese dictionaries of Chinese characters that were intended for literati, the Setsuy≈çsh≈´ was a true Japanese language dictionary and entered vocabulary current in Muromachi times. Each main entry gives the word in kanji (Chinese characters), notes Japanese pronunciation in katakana on the right, and occasionally adds etymologies and comments on the bottom. There are numerous Setsuy≈çsh≈´ editions (over 180 from the Edo period) and many vary in content and format. Most versions collate words according to their first syllable under 43‚Äì47 iroha divisions (bu ÈÉ®) with 9‚Äì16 semantic subdivisions (mon ÈñÄ), which usually begin with \\"Heaven and Earth\\" (Tenchi Â§©Âú∞) and end with \\"Unclassified words\\" (Genji Ë®ÄËæû). This arrangement combines both Iroha Jiruish≈ç phonetic ordering and Kagakush≈´ semantic classifications. The Japanese linguist Hashimoto Shinkichi analyzed differences among early Setsuy≈çsh≈´ editions and found three categories, distinguished by the first word beginning with i- appearing under the first '\\"Heaven and Earth\\" heading. The dictionaries' initial word is either Ise (‰ºäÂã¢ \\"old name for Mie Prefecture\\"), Indo (Âç∞Â∫¶ \\"India\\"), or inui (‰πæ \\"northwest\\"). \\"Ise editions\\" have few appendices, put place names near the beginning of subject headings, and are probably the oldest redaction. \\"Indo editions\\" have many appendices, including place names, and clearly have been supplemented from the 1444 CE Kagakush≈´. \\"Inui editions\\" are usually printed with movable type, have more entries and corrections, and are the newest version. Setsuy≈çsh≈´ has a parallel with Webster's informally meaning \\"English language dictionary\\". Nakao (1989:37) notes this dictionary \\"remained popular for so long that the name Setsuyoshu was used as a generic term for Japanese dictionaries (with the entries arranged in the order of iroha)\\".

The Justice of Trajan by Eug√®ne Delacroix, 1840. The Justice of Trajan is a legendary episode in the life of Roman Emperor Trajan, based upon Dio Cassius' account (Epitome of Book LXVIII, chapter 10): \\"He did not, however, as might have been expected of a warlike man, pay any less attention to the civil administration nor did he dispense justice any the less; on the contrary, he conducted trials, now in the Forum of Augustus, now in the Portico of Livia, as it was called, and often elsewhere on a tribunal.\\" According to the story, Trajan, busy with preparations for the Dacian Wars, was petitioned for justice by the mother of a murdered man. He asked her to wait until he returned, but she pointed out that he might not return at all. He made time to settle her case despite all the other calls on his time. The legend, though indirectly, was popularized by Dante in The Divine Comedy, alluded to in the Paradise, and recounted in Purgatory, X, 73-94: The origin of the legend and its vicissitudes since antiquity have been the subject of several studies, including the detailed \\"Leggende\\" by G. Boni, published in 1906. The episode was depicted in several works of art and in the verse The Justice by Belarusian poet Simeon of Polotsk (1629‚Äî1680). Visually, the core motif is the confrontation between the emperor, often mounted on a horse, and the widow, sometimes shown kneeling. Some depictions, like that carved on the facade of the Doge's Palace, Venice, are restricted to those figures, but often there is a great crowd of the emperor's army and courtiers. Among artists that depicted the legend are Eug√®ne Delacroix, Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Sebald Beham, No√´l Coypel and No√´l Hall√©. A French painter Raoul Dufy was inspired by Delacroix's painting of the justice. Historically, the justice of Trajan may also refer either to what was described by Pliny the Younger (Epistulae, VI, 31, a court trial in Centumcellae) or depicted on Trajan's Column, where Trajan judges the captured barbarian chiefs, or to a lost painting by Rogier van der Weyden. (The city of Brussels commissioned Van der Weyden to paint four large panel paintings for the Brussels Town Hall illustrating the 'Justice of Trajan' and the 'Justice of Herkenbald'; they were destroyed when the French bombarded the city in 1695).Dirk de Vos, 1999, Rogier van der Weyden, pp. 345-355 File:4431 - Venezia - Palazzo ducale - Colonna 36 - Traiano imperadore che f√® iustitia ala vedova - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 31-Jul-2008.jpgCapital on the \\"Corner of Justice\\" of the Doge's Palace, Venice File:Lippo d'andrea (pseudo ambrogio di baldese), desco da parto con la giustizia di traiano e putto con tamburello e flauto, 01.jpg15th-century Italian desco da parto File:Maestro delle antiche leggende eroiche, giustizia di traiano, 1525-50 ca.

Biography Hermann Schaaffhausen was the son of Josef Hubert Schaaffhausen and Anna Maria Wachendorf. He studied medicine at the University of Berlin and received his doctorate degree in 1839, and became a Professor of Anatomy at the University of Bonn. Schaaffhausen soon became involved in research in physical anthropology and the study of prehistoric humans in Europe. He is best known for his study of the Neanderthal fossils (together with J.C. Fuhlrott). He was a member of several scientific societies, including the Naturhistorischen Vereins der preussischen Rheinlande und Westphalens (Natural History Society of the Rhineland and Westphalia) located in Bonn, the Vereins von Alterthumsfreunden im Rheinlande (Association of the Friends of Antiquity in the Rhineland), and was an honorary member of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte (German Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory). He became a member of the prestigious Kaiserlichen Leopoldinisch-Carolinischen Deutschen Akademie der Naturforscher on 25 November 1873. Schaafhausen served as co- editor of the influential journal Archiv f√ºr Anthropologie. He was also one of the founders of the Rheinischen Landesmuseums located in Bonn. In addition to his scientific activities Schaaffhausen served as president of the Vereins der Rettung zur See (Association for Rescue at Sea). Although Darwin's theory of evolution was not yet published, Schaaffhausen discussed the idea of species evolving in an article titled ‚ÄúUeber Best√§ndigkeit und Umwandlung der Arten‚Äù (On the Constancy and Transformation of Species) published in the Verhandlungen des Naturhistorischen Vereins der preussischen Rheinlande und Westphalens (1853) in which he declared that \\"the immutability of species...is not proven.\\" In the third edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1861, Charles Darwin added a Historical Sketch that acknowledged the ideas of Schaaffhausen.\\"The Origin of Species\\". Preface to the Third Edition. Many of his most important anthropological papers were collected and published in a book titled Anthropologische Studien (1885).  Schaaffhausen and the discovery of Neanderthal Man  Workmen quarrying the Feldhofer Grotte in the Neander Valley, near D√ºsseldorf in northern Germany, in 1856 unearthed human bones in the floor of the cave. A local schoolmaster Johann Carl Fuhlrott, who was interested in geology and paleontology, learned of the discovery and went to the site to collect the unusual bones. They consisted of the top portion of a skull, a clavicle and scapula, the right and left ulnae, a radius bone, the left hip bone, and the right and left femora. Fuhlrott was immediately struck by the fact that the bones appeared to be completely fossilized and the geological location of the bones in the cave, both suggesting that the bones were extremely old. Fuhlrott, recognizing the possible scientific significance of the find, brought the bones to Schaaffhausen in Bonn for analysis. Schaaffhausen was impressed by the primitive form of the skull and the evidence for their geological antiquity. Fuhlrott and Schaaffhausen presented papers on the fossils and the geology of the Feldhofer Cave at a meeting of the Niederrheinische Gesellschaft f√ºr Natur- und Heilkunde (Lower Rhine Society for Natural History and Medical Studies) in Bonn in 1857. Schaaffhausen published a paper on the Neanderthal fossils in the Archiv f√ºr Anatomie, Physiologie und wissenschaftliche Medicin in 1858 and Fuhlrott published a paper in the Verhandlungen des Naturhistorischen Vereins der preussischen Rheinlande und Westphalens in 1859 describing the geology of the site and how the bones were discovered. Fuhlrott and Schaaffhausen believed the Neanderthal fossils dated from the Glacial Period when extinct animals such as mammoths and the woolly rhinoceros still lived in Europe, which would make them among the oldest human remains known. This was before scientists believed humans lived during the Ice Age. Furthermore, Schaaffhausen noted that the Neanderthal skull differed from modern human skulls. He argued that the prominent bony ridges over the eyes and the general shape of the skull indicated that it belonged to a savage and barbarous race of human. Schaaffhausen concluded that the bones belonged to the original wild race of humans that lived in Europe before modern European peoples migrated into Europe in prehistoric times. The fossils generated considerable debate among anthropologists in Germany and abroad. The prominent German anthropologist Rudolf Virchow rejected Schaaffhausen's interpretation of the fossils, considering them the pathological remains of an ancient human. However, in 1864 William King, professor of geology at Queens College in Galway, Ireland, presented a paper where he argued the Neanderthal fossils belonged to an extinct species of early human that he named Homo neanderthalensis. Schaaffhausen continued to write on the Neanderthal fossils over the next two decades, comparing the bones with newly discovered Ice Age human fossils from Belgium, the Cro-magnon fossils from France, and Stone Age human bones from tombs across Europe.

During the 1920s, Noble and others discovered platinum in Beegum Creek, causing Noble's Station to quickly become known as \\"Platina\\". Platina is a native alloy of platinum with osmium and other related metals. Platina post office The current Platina post office was established in 1921. Today, it and the general store stand on almost the same spot as the old station. The store's owners recently tried to sell it and a few other buildings in town on eBay, but were unsuccessful.Dottie Smith, Platina is Tucked Away in the SW corner of Shasta County.

All of his preserved poetry can be found in the Cancionero de Baena.  Life  Very little can be said with certainty about the biography of Imperial. In the rubrics that appear above three of his poems in the Cancionero de Baena, we are told that he was born in Genoa and lived in Seville. Gonzalo Argote de Molina, a 16th-century Spanish genealogist, reports that Imperial belonged to one of the noble families of Genoa, from which families two consuls were periodically appointed to promote Genoese interests in Seville. Some have connected Francisco Imperial to a ‚ÄúJaimes Emperial,‚Äù who is mentioned in the will of Pedro the Cruel, suggesting that this Jaimes Emperial may be the father of the poet, but this identification is uncertain. It seems that Imperial served as the lieutenant of the Admiral of Castile: a 1403 letter from King Martin I of Aragon is addressed to ‚Äú‚Äù Another document from 1409 refers to the ‚Äúherederos [heirs] de mi√ßer Francisco Imperial‚Äù: this has been viewed as indicating that by this date the poet had died. These documents constitute the extent of our knowledge about Imperial‚Äôs life. The lack of biographical detail on Imperial has led scholars to look in his poetry for clues to his life story. Archer Woodford has suggested that Imperial was an ecclesiastic, drawing this conclusion based on his apparent familiarity with and references to the Catholic liturgy. Colbert Nepaulsingh has asserted that the appointment of Alfonso Enriquez as the admiral of Castile (a position that he claims Imperial could have expected to assume himself), signifies a rupture between Imperial and Enrique III, and interprets some elements in Imperial‚Äôs poetry as references to this hostility. All of these suggestions appear to be highly conjectural. Imperial seems to have been a poet of some note. He is one of the best represented poets in the Cancionero de Baena, and in his Proemio e carta al condestable don Pedro de Portugal, the Marques de Santillana singles out Imperial (and only Imperial, among writers in Spanish) as being worthy of the title of ‚Äúpoeta.‚Äù In addition, some of Imperial's poems were well known enough to have elicited poetic responses (respuestas) from his contemporaries.  Works  In his edition of the poems of Imperial, Colbert Nepaulsingh attributes 18 poems to his authorship. As noted above, all of these poems appear in the Cancionero de Baena; some are ascribed explicitly to Imperial in the rubrics, while others have been identified as likely his based on their content and diction. The majority of Imperial‚Äôs poetry consists of short lyrics. He wrote several poems on the subject of the nature of the goddess Fortune, in which he challenged the idea that Fortune dispenses justice and is an instrument of divine Providence, emphasizing instead the capriciousness and apparent unfairness of Fortune‚Äôs effects. Imperial also wrote numerous love lyrics, among which several in praise of a woman he referred to as ‚ÄúEstrella Diana.‚Äù Two poems exist which appear to comment on the arrival in Seville of Angelina de Grecia, a noblewoman, possibly a Hungarian, who had been taken prisoner by Tamerlane and sent to the Spanish as a gift. However, Imperial is chiefly known for two longer, allegorical works written in arte mayor: The Dezir al nacimiento de Juan II, written in 1405 in celebration of the birth of the son of Enrique III, and the Dezir a las syete virtudes, Imperial‚Äôs longest and most famous work, which recounts a dream-vision of the Seven Virtues and contains many references to the Divine Comedy of Dante.  Distinctive Features of Imperial‚Äôs Poetry  Influence of Dante Dante is a constant presence in Imperial‚Äôs poetry, most significantly in the Dezir a las syete virtudes, but elsewhere as well (poems 226 and 232, Cancionero de Baena, J. Gonz√°lez Cuenca-B. Dutton (eds.), Visor, Madrid, 1993). One of Imperial‚Äôs poems (n¬∫ 226) features Dante as a principal character, and in large part consists of the imagined words of the Florentine poet. And when Imperial challenges the idea that Fortune is an extension of divine Providence, he explicitly mentions that he is disagreeing with Dante‚Äôs conception of Fortune (found in Inferno VII). Translations of lines from Dante abound in Imperial, though they are often placed in very different contexts. To take one example, the Dezir al nacimiento de Juan II expresses the hope that the prince Juan will prove to be the ‚Äúmaestro de los que ssaben‚Äù (the master of those who know). This is a direct translation of Dante‚Äôs description of Aristotle as ‚Äúil maestro di color che sanno.‚Äù (Inferno IV.) In addition to translating single lines, in the Dezir a las syete virtudes Imperial also frequently translates longer passages from Dante, incorporating passages of as many as six lines into his text. Imperial‚Äôs poetry also contains thematic allusions to Dante‚Äôs poetry; one of these is the Dantesque simile, examples of which appear throughout the Dezir a las syete virtudes, and another is the employment of a poetic predecessor as a guide on a visionary journey (in Dante, this guide was Virgil; in Imperial, the guide is Dante). Between verbal echoes, allusions, and translations, at least one direct reference to Dante can be found in almost every stanza of the Dezir a las syete virtudes. Interest in foreign languages Imperial‚Äôs poetry is notable for its employment of foreign words and phrases. Not surprisingly, Imperial introduces many Italianisms into his poetry (most notably, the word ‚Äútransumanar,‚Äù which Dante had coined in the Paradiso). But, in addition, the Dezir al nacimiento de Juan II contains lines that attempt to imitate French, Latin, English and Arabic. Another lyric contains an entire verse in what appears to be a version of Proven√ßal (in this Imperial follows Dante, who placed Proven√ßal verses in the mouth of the spirit of the poet Arnaut Daniel). And one of the poems about Angelina de Grecia contains a word (‚Äúcardiamo‚Äù) apparently based on Greek, and another word (‚Äússenguil‚Äù) which has been connected to Hungarian. Some scholars consider Imperial to be a transitional figure, and view his poetry as an anticipation of the arrival of the Renaissance in Spain. Others see Imperial as a poet of little significance, who mechanically incorporated allusions to Dante into his poetry while failing to appreciate Dante's revolutionary qualities. Regardless, for its adoption of exotic, foreign elements, and in particular for its significant debt to Dante, Imperial's poetry stands out from that of his Spanish contemporaries.

Career He took a degree in medicine at the University of Edinburgh. He later traveled to mainland Europe where he studied in many countries. During the Second World War, he was a specialist in psychiatry in the Middle East. As well as practicing in the army, he also gained experience in mental hospitals, prisons and selection boards. Later he became interested in the normal individual's adjustment to society. He joined a large industrial concern after the war, where he worked for seven years. Even though he learned in a school of thought which considered mental illness mainly as an individual and biological problem, he later regarded it basically as a social one. He took the view that the mental conflicts of the neurotic are in large part induced by the sick society in which he or she lives. Thus, he felt that the efficiency of industry cannot be weighed solely in terms of the amount goods it produces or its financial profits, but also considering at what cost of human health and happiness the goods were produced.

The story began in Bloody Jack, and continues in Under the Jolly Roger, In the Belly of the Bloodhound, Mississippi Jack, My Bonny Light Horseman, Rapture of the Deep, The Wake of the Lorelei Lee, The Mark of the Golden Dragon, Viva Jacquelina!, Boston Jacky, and Wild Rover No More. Plot introduction At the end of Bloody Jack, Jacky Faber is exposed as a girl and sent to the Lawson Peabody School for Young Girls in Boston, in the hopes that they can find her a husband. =Explanation of the novel's title= Curse of the Blue Tattoo refers to the anchor tattoo Jacky received while serving as a ship's boy. Frequently mistaken for a pitchfork, it becomes a great source of trouble for her. Plot summary After saying goodbye to her shipmates, Jacky is sent to Lawson Peabody's and turned over to the custody of Miranda Pimm, the elderly headmistress. From the start, it is clear that she has a very low opinion of Jacky, going so far as to have her earring cut off and her mail seized to keep her from sending letters to her beloved, Midshipman Jaimy Fletcher. Shunned by most of her fellow students, Jacky strikes up a friendship with Amy Trevelyne, the daughter of a wealthy Massachusetts farmer. Clarissa Worthington Howe, an arrogant Virginia heiress who enjoys abusing the school staff, takes an instant dislike to Jacky and insults her mother, resulting in a fight between the girls. As punishment, the two are beaten and forced to give up dinner and supper. Eager to please Pimm, Jacky throws herself into her classes, which include horse riding, art, music, embroidery, French, and etiquette. Jacky is subsequently noticed by Reverend Richard Mather, the school priest, who views her as a disgrace. While visiting the graveyard near his church, Jacky stumbles upon an unmarked grave, which she later learns belonged to Mather's former servant, Janey Porter. While wandering the streets of Boston unsupervised, Jacky is arrested for public indecency and put on trial. When the court learns that she attends Lawson Peabody's, however, they decide to embarrass the school by having Jacky paraded through the streets in chains. Humiliated, Pimm assigns Jacky to work as a lowly servant, while Mather petitions the court to appoint him as her legal guardian. Welcomed by her fellow workers, Jacky decides to form a Sisterhood of Lawson Peabody Girls, consisting of several serving girls and Amy. While meeting with her lawyer, Ezra Pickering, she also learns that Janey Porter's death was declared a suicide, but was briefly suspected to be murder. Jacky spies on Mather and discovers that he is a drunkard and religious zealot obsessed with ridding the world of \\"witches\\" and \\"demons\\". Convinced that Mather is responsible for killing Janey, Jacky poses as her and starts \\"haunting\\" him, further increasing his paranoia. Having grown increasingly attracted to Amy's brother Randall, Jacky attends a party at her family's mansion, during which she gets drunk and makes a fool of herself. After an argument with Amy, Jacky runs away and flees to New York City. On the way there, two men hired by Mather abduct her and bring her back to the school. Convinced that Jacky is Janey reincarnated, Mather plans to stake her with her own shiv. A fire breaks out in the church, during which Jacky's friends rescue her and trap Mather, causing him to die when the church collapses in on itself. The fire then spreads to the school, and though Jacky manages to save Pimm and her students, the entire building is lost. Fearing arrest, Jacky flees Boston and joins the crew of a whaling ship as a servant. Characters in \\"Curse of the Blue Tattoo\\" * Mary 'Jacky' Faber: The protagonist of the story.

The purpose of the Commission was to oversee all Mafia activities in the United States and serve to mediate conflicts between families. Throughout the history of the Commission, the body has been involved in several incidents including the Apalachin meeting in 1957, a plot to kill several members of the Commission in 1963, and the Mafia Commission Trial in 1985. History =Pre-Commission= Pre-1931, capo dei capi (boss of bosses) was a term applied by mobsters to Giuseppe Morello around 1900, according to Nick Gentile.Critchley, The Origin of Organized Crime in America: The New York City Mafia, 1891-1931, p.46 Bosses Joe Masseria (1928‚Äì1931) and Salvatore Maranzano (1931) used the title as part of their efforts to centralize control of the Mafia under themselves. When Maranzano won the Castellammarese War, he set himself up as boss of all bosses, created the Five Families, and ordered every Mafia family to pay him tribute. This provoked a rebellious reaction which led to him being murdered in September 1931, on the orders of Lucky Luciano.\\"Lucky Luciano: Criminal Mastermind,\\" Time, Dec. 7, 1998 =The Commission's formation= After Maranzano's murder in 1931, Luciano called a meeting in Chicago.Critchley, The Origin of Organized Crime in America: The New York City Mafia, 1891-1931, p. 232Humbert S.

Luciano's goals with the Commission were to quietly maintain his own power over all the families, and to prevent future gang wars; the bosses approved the idea of the Commission.Capeci, Jerry.

The Commission consisted of seven family bosses: the leaders of New York's Five Families: Charlie \\"Lucky\\" Luciano, Vincent Mangano, Tommy Gagliano, Joseph Bonanno, and Joe Profaci; Chicago Outfit boss Al Capone; and Buffalo family boss Stefano Magaddino. Charlie Luciano was appointed chairman of the Commission. The Commission agreed to hold meetings every five years or when they needed to discuss family problems. =The power of the Commission= FBI chart of American Mafia Bosses across the country in 1963 The Commission held the power of approving a new boss before he could take over officially. The New York Five Families also decided that the names of all new proposed members must be approved by the other families. After the new proposed member was approved by the other families, he could become a made man. The Commission allowed Jewish mobsters Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter, Dutch Schultz, and Abner \\"Longie\\" Zwillman to work alongside them and participate in some meetings.Russo, Gus. The Outfit: The Role of Chicago's Underworld in the Shaping of Modern America pp. 32‚Äì33, 41 221 The group's first test came in 1935, when it ordered Dutch Schultz to drop his plans to murder Special Prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey. Luciano argued that a Dewey assassination would precipitate a massive law enforcement crackdown. An enraged Schultz said he would kill Dewey anyway and walked out of the meeting. Murder, Inc leader Albert Anastasia approached Luciano with information that Schultz had asked him to stake out Dewey's apartment building on Fifth Avenue. Upon hearing the news, the Commission held a discreet meeting to discuss the matter. After six hours of deliberations the Commission ordered Lepke Buchalter to eliminate Schultz.Newark, p. 81 On October 23, 1935, before he could kill Dewey, Schultz was shot in a tavern in Newark, New Jersey, and succumbed to his injuries the following day. On May 13, 1936, Luciano's pandering trial began.Stolberg, p. 133 Dewey prosecuted the case that Carter built against Luciano. He accused Luciano of being part of a massive prostitution ring known as \\"the Combination\\". During the trial, Dewey exposed Luciano for lying on the witness stand through direct quizzing and records of telephone calls; Luciano also had no explanation for why his federal income tax records claimed he made only $22,000 a year, while he was obviously a wealthy man.Stolberg, p. 148 On June 7, Luciano was convicted on 62 counts of compulsory prostitution. On June 18, he was sentenced to 30 to 50 years in state prison, along with Betillo and others. The Navy, the State of New York and Luciano reached a deal: in exchange for a commutation of his sentence, Luciano promised the complete assistance of his organization in providing intelligence to the Navy. Anastasia, a Luciano ally who controlled the docks, allegedly promised no dockworker strikes during war. In preparation for the 1943 allied invasion of Sicily, Luciano allegedly provided the US military with Sicilian Mafia contacts. This collaboration between the Navy and the Mafia became known as Operation Underworld.Newark, p. 137 On January 3, 1946, as a presumed reward for his alleged wartime cooperation, Dewey reluctantly commuted Luciano's pandering sentence on condition that he did not resist deportation to Italy. Luciano accepted the deal, although he still maintained that he was a US citizen and not subject to deportation. On February 2, 1946, two federal immigration agents transported Luciano from Sing Sing prison to Ellis Island in New York Harbor for deportation proceedings. On February 10, Luciano's ship sailed from Brooklyn harbor for Italy. In 1951, conservative faction leader Vincent Mangano went missing and Albert Anastasia sided with \\"liberal-American faction\\" members Frank Costello and Tommy Lucchese. The power of the Commission shifted from the \\"conservative-Sicilian faction\\" to the \\"liberal-American faction\\".Bonanno A Man of Honor pp. 170‚Äì185 In 1951, Vincent Mangano disappeared, and his brother Philip Mangano found dead near Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, allegedly on the orders of family underboss Albert Anastasia. With Mangano gone, Frank Costello became the Commission leader for the \\"liberal faction\\", and Joseph Bonanno became the leader of the \\"conservative faction\\". The liberal faction was supported by those who were also open with working with non-Italian organizations and drugs, namely by Vito Genovese, Tommy Lucchese and Carlo Gambino (was opposed to drugs), while the conservative faction were more reserved with older traditional Italian of honor and loyalty, namely by Joe Profaci and Stefano Magaddino. After a 1956 Commission meeting, the crime families of Philadelphia, headed by Angelo Bruno, and Detroit, headed by Joseph Zerilli, were added, with smaller families being formally represented by a Commission family. =Apalachin meeting= A year later, on November 14, 1957, the Apalachin meeting was called by Genovese at the Upstate New York estate of Joseph Barbara to discuss the future of Cosa Nostra.Bonanno, p. 217 However, the meeting was aborted when police investigated the destination of the many out-of-state attendees' vehicles and arrested many of the fleeing mafiosi.Raab, pp. 117-118 About 100 mobsters attended the meeting, and over 60 of those were apprehended; all those apprehended were fined, up to $10,000 each, and given prison sentences ranging from three to five years, however, all the convictions were overturned on appeal in 1960. In any case, Bonanno suffered a heart attack and was removed from testifying in the trial.Raab, pp. 119-120Bonanno, p. 222 Long- time FBI director J. Edgar Hoover had denied the existence of a \\"National Crime Syndicate\\" and the need to address organized crime in America. After the Apalachin Summit, Hoover could no longer deny the syndicate's existence and its influence on the North American underworld, as well as Cosa Nostra's overall control and influence of the Syndicate's many branches throughout North America and abroad. After the Apalachin Meeting, J. Edgar Hoover created the \\"Top Hoodlum Program\\" and went after the syndicate's top bosses throughout the country. =Commission plot= In 1963, Bonanno made plans to assassinate several rivals on the Commission‚Äîbosses Lucchese, Gambino, and Magaddino, as well as Frank DeSimone.Staff (September 1, 1967) \\"The Mob: How Joe Bonanno Schemed to kill ‚Äì and lost\\" Life p.15-21 Bonanno sought Profaci crime family boss Joseph Magliocco's support, and Magliocco readily agreed due to his bitterness from being denied a seat on the Commission previously. Bonanno's audacious goal was to take over the Commission and make Magliocco his right hand man. Magliocco was assigned the task of killing Lucchese and Gambino, and gave the contract to one of his top hit men, Joseph Colombo. However, the opportunistic Colombo revealed the plot to its targets. The other bosses realized that Magliocco could not have planned this himself. Remembering how close Bonanno was with Magliocco (and before him, Joe Profaci), as well as their close ties through marriages, the other bosses concluded Bonanno was the real mastermind. The Commission summoned Bonanno and Magliocco to explain themselves. In mid 1964, Bonanno fled to Montreal, leaving Magliocco to deal with the Commission.Schneider, Iced: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada, pp. 255 Badly shaken and in failing health, Magliocco confessed his role in the plot. The Commission spared Magliocco's life, but forced him to retire as Profaci family boss and pay a $50,000 fine. As a reward for turning on his boss, Colombo took control of the Profaci family. =Trial= As part of the Mafia Commission Trial, on February 25, 1985, nine New York Mafia leaders were indicted for narcotics trafficking, loansharking, gambling, labor racketeering and extortion against construction companies under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. On July 1, 1985, the original nine men, with the addition of two more New York Mafia leaders, pleaded not guilty to a second set of racketeering charges as part of the trial. Prosecutors aimed to strike at all the crime families at once using their involvement in the Commission. On December 2, 1985, Dellacroce died of cancer. Castellano was later murdered on December 16, 1985. According to Colombo hitman and FBI informant Gregory Scarpa, Persico and Gambino boss John Gotti backed a plan to kill the lead prosecutor, and future New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani in late 1986, but it was rejected by the rest of the Commission. In the early 1980s, the Bonanno family were kicked off the Commission due to the Donnie Brasco infiltration, and although Rastelli was one of the men initially indicted, this removal from the Commission actually allowed Rastelli to be removed from the Commission Trial as he was later indicted on separate labor racketeering charges. Having previously lost their seat on the Commission, the Bonannos suffered less exposure than the other families in this case. Eight defendants were convicted of racketeering on November 19, 1986, with the exception of Indelicato who was convicted of murder, and were sentenced on January 13, 1987, as follows: In the early 1990s, as the Colombo crime family war raged, the Commission refused to allow any Colombo member to sit on the CommissionMcPhee, Michele (July 7, 2002)\\"Furgebbaboud the Old Mob; After Gotti, Mafia ordered to clean house\\" New York Daily News and considered dissolving the family. =Status= According to Joseph Massino, former boss of the Bonanno family, the last known Commission meeting held with all the bosses was in November 1985, just before the death of Paul Castellano that December. However, a Commission meeting in 1988 was led by John Gotti and attended by Vincent Gigante and new Lucchese boss Victor Amuso, the first Commission meeting since the Mafia Commission Trial.Raab, pp. 407‚Äì409 According to Salvatore Vitale, a Commission meeting was held in early 2000 to restore the rule requiring both parents to be of Italian descent in order to become a made man. The Commission is still reported to exist, though its current membership is composed of only the bosses of the Five Families and the Chicago Outfit. Instead of a meeting of bosses, underbosses or captains meet secretly to discuss business and govern.\\"After Gotti, Mafia ordered to clean house\\" New York Daily News. July 7, 2002 In October 2017, Domenico Violi of the Luppino crime family in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada was heard to have been named underboss of the Buffalo crime family on wiretaps; this revealed the activity of The Commission as Violi's promotion was so unusual, being the first Canadian to hold the second-highest position in the American Mafia, that Buffalo crime family boss Joseph Todaro Jr. stated he consulted with The Commission for permission to promote him as Buffalo's new underboss.

It is used to separate oil and water mixtures into their separate components. This page refers exclusively to oily water separators aboard marine vessels. They are found on board ships where they are used to separate oil from oily waste water such as bilge water before the waste water is discharged into the environment. These discharges of waste water must comply with the requirements laid out in Marpol 73/78. Bilge water is a near-unavoidable product of shipboard operations. Oil leaks from running machinery such as diesel generators, air compressors, and the main propulsion engine. Modern OWSs have alarms and automatic closure devices which are activated when the oil storage content of the waste water exceeds a certain limit(15ppm : 15 cm3 of oil in 1m3 of water). Purpose Oily water separator piping diagram The primary purpose of a shipboard oily water separator (OWS) is to separate oil and other contaminants that could be harmful for the oceans. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) publishes regulations through the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC). On July 18, 2003, the MEPC issued new regulations that each vessel built after this date had to follow. This document is known as MEPC 107(49)MEPC 107(49) and it details revised guidelines and specifications for pollution prevention equipment for machinery space bilges of ships. Each OWS must be able to achieve clean bilge water under 15 ppm of type C oil or heavily emulsified oil, and any other contaminants that may be found. All oil content monitors (OCM) must be tamper- proof. Also whenever the OWS is being cleaned out the OCM must be active. An OWS must be able to clear out contaminants as well as oil. Some of these contaminating agents include lubricating oil, cleaning product, soot from combustion, fuel oil, rust, sewage, and several other things that can be harmful to the ocean environment. Bilge content The bilge area is the lowest area on a ship. The bilge water that collects here include drain water or leftover water from the boilers, water collecting tanks, drinking water and other places where water can not overflow. However, bilge water doesn't just include water drainage. Another system that drains into the Bilge system comes from the propulsion area of the ship. Here fuels, lubricants, hydraulic fluid, antifreeze, solvents, and cleaning chemicals drain into the engine room bilges in small quantities. The OWS is intended to remove a large proportion of these contaminants before discharge to the environment (overboard to the sea).  Design and operation  All OWS equipment, new or old, can, in a laboratory setting, separate oil and water, do so automatically, and produce clean water for discharge overboard that contains no more than 15 parts per million oil. OWS equipment is approved by testing it with specific cocktails of mixed oil and water. Initially these combinations were very simple, basically no more than a mixture of clean water and diesel fuel, but they have become more sophisticated under MARPOL MEPC 107(49). The vast majority of these many equipment models, manufacturers, and types start with some sort of gravity separation of bilge water. Simply letting oil and water sit is called decanting, and this does not always meet the 15 ppm criterion, which is why each manufacturer has added additional features to his equipment to ensure that this criterion can be met. The separation that takes place inside the OWS allows oil that floats to the top to be automatically skimmed off to a sludge tank or dirty oil holding tank. There is no official standard for tank naming convention but there are some proposals for that. An OWS needs to be fitted with an oil content meter (OCM) that samples the OWS overboard discharge water for oil content. If the oil content is less than 15 ppm, the OCM allows the water to be discharged overboard. If the oil content is higher than 15 ppm, the OCM will activate an alarm and move a three-way valve that, within a short period of time, will recirculate the overboard discharge water to a tank on the OWS suction side. An OCM takes a trickle sample from the OWS overboard discharge line and shines a light through the sample to an optical sensor. Since small oil droplets will diffract and diffuse light, a change in signal at the sensor will indicate the presence of oil. At a certain signal setting that is roughly equivalent to 15 ppm, the sensor will conclude that there is too much oil going through the discharge line. This calibration generally takes place in a lab, but can be tested by use of a three-sample liquid aboard the vessel. If the OCM ends up sampling a certain amount of heavy oil, the OCM will be fouled and it will need to be flushed or cleaned. Shipboard engine room The cleaning can be done by running fresh water through the OCM via a permanent connection or can be performed by opening the OCM sample area and scrubbing the sample area with a bottle brush. The water removed by the OWS flows to oil collecting spaces. There can be two stages. The first-stage filter removes physical impurities present and promotes some fine separation. The second-stage filter uses coalescer inserts to achieve the final de-oiling. Coalescence is the breakdown of surface tension between oil droplets in an oil/water mixture which causes them to join and increase in size. The oil from the collecting spaces is drained away automatically or manually. In most modern ships, the oil from collecting spaces is drained away automatically.  Oil record book  All Cargo vessels where MARPOL Convention is applicable must have an oil record book where the chief engineer will record all oil or sludge transfers and discharges within the vessel. This is necessary in order for authorities to be able to monitor if a vessel's crew has performed any illegal oil discharges at sea. When making entries in the oil record book Part I, the date, operational code, and item number are inserted in the appropriate columns and the required particulars shall be recorded in chronological order as they have been executed on board. Each operation is to be fully recorded without delay so that all the entries in the book appropriate to that operation are completed. History of regulations for treated water discharge In 1948 in the USA, a Water Pollution Control Act (WPA) was passed by the federal government. This act gave rights to the surgeon general of the public health service to make programs to decrease the amount of pollution in the world's waters. The main concern was to save water, protect fish, and have clean water for agricultural usage. The WPA also helped to start the process of building water treatment plants. This is to guard against sewage from polluting drinking water. In 1972 the WPA was amended to include more requirements in order to insure that the water is chemically sound. This amendment also furthered regulations to insure the quality of the water was up to par. In 1987 the WPA was amended again to put an even more strict control on water supply pollution. With this new amendment water sources had to fit a specific set of criteria to fight against pollution. = MARPOL = Marpol 73/78 is the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978. (\\"Marpol\\" is short for marine pollution and 73/78 short for the years 1973 and 1978.) Marpol 73/78 is one of the most important international marine environmental conventions. It was designed to minimize pollution of the seas, including dumping, oil and exhaust pollution. Its stated object is to preserve the marine environment through the complete elimination of pollution by oil and other harmful substances and the minimization of accidental discharge of such substances.  Current regulations  =USA= The regulations in the Clean Water Act limit what may be discharged to sea from an OWS in USA waters. Current limits are oil for discharges within 12 nautical miles of shore or 100 mg/l outside that limit. =Europe and Canada= European countries and Canada have stricter rules on discharge and discharges must contain less than 5 mg/l of contaminants. The discharge of oil contaminated waters are also subject to international controls such as the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), and International Maritime Organization (IMO). These organizations set strict limits to protect marine life and coastal environments. These agencies require logs to be kept of any discharges of contaminated water. Types =Gravity plate separator= Marine Oily water separator A gravity plate separator contains a series of plates through which the contaminated water flows. The oil in the water coalesces on the underside of the plate eventually forming droplets before coalescing into liquid oil which floats off the plates and accumulates at the top of the chamber. The oil accumulating at the top is then transferred to waste oil tank on the vessel where it is later discharged to a treatment facility shore side. This type of Oily Water Separator is very common in ships but it has some flaws that decrease efficiency. Oil particles that are twenty micrometers or smaller do not get separated. The variety of oily wastes in bilge water can limit removal efficiency especially when very dense and highly viscous oils such as bunker oil are present. Plates must be replaced when fouled, which increases the costs of operation. =Electrochemical= Wastewater purification of oils and contaminants by electrochemical emulsification is actively in research and development. Electrochemical emulsification involves the generation of electrolytic bubbles that attract pollutants such as sludge and carry them to the top of the treatment chamber. Once at the top of the treatment chamber the oil and other pollutants are transferred to a waste oil tank. =Bioremediation= Bioremediation is the use of microorganisms to treat contaminated water. A carefully managed environment is needed for the microorganisms which includes nutrients and hydrocarbons such as oil or other contaminants, and oxygen. In pilot scale studies, bio-remediation was used as one stage in a multi-stage purification process involving a plate separator to remove the majority of the contaminants and was able to treat pollutants at very low concentrations including organic contaminants such as glycerol, solvents, jet fuel, detergents, and phosphates. After treatment of contaminated water, carbon dioxide, water and an organic sludge were the only residual products. = Centrifugal = A centrifugal water-oil separator, centrifugal oil-water separator or centrifugal liquid-liquid separator is a device designed to separate oil and water by centrifugation. It generally contains a cylindrical container that rotates inside a larger stationary container. The denser liquid, usually water, accumulates at the periphery of the rotating container and is collected from the side of the device, whereas the less dense liquid, usually oil, accumulates at the rotation axis and is collected from the center. Centrifugal oil-water separators are used for waste water processing and for cleanup of oil spills on sea or on lake. Centrifugal oil-water separators are also used for filtering diesel and lubricating oils by removing the waste particles and impurity from them.  Problems  On a properly operated vessel only small amounts of bilge would be present as long as there are no equipment failures. But even the best-operated vessels suffer equipment failures, which then quickly results in contaminated bilges. Sometimes these contaminants are massive and pose a serious challenge to the crew to deal with in a legal fashion. A properly designed OWS system will make it clear and easy for regulatory enforcement agencies to determine if OWS system regulations are being violated. At present, there is no clear and efficient method of determining whether regulations are violated or not. At the most basic level, the absolute absence of any type of standardization of OWS systems makes the initial investigation confusing, dirty, time consuming and sometimes plain incorrect. In the marine industry there is a long-standing and important tradition of \\"jointness\\" in marine forensic investigations, where all parties at interest examine the same things at the same time. However, due to the criminal character of OWS violations the jointness concept is abandoned, which leads to very poor technical investigative methods and severe unnecessary disruptions to vessel operations. Various efforts are being made to improve the overall OWS system approach. In 2015, at the MAX1 Studies Conference held in Wilmington, North Carolina, maritime leaders from many different sectors gathered to discuss problems potential solutions regarding waste stream management.

It is named after the schooner on which Bishop Pompallier travelled around New Zealand. The name The College is named after the mission schooner Sancta Maria on which Bishop Jean Baptist Pompallier sailed around New Zealand. The name Sancta Maria is a Latin title for Mary, the Mother of God. It means Holy Mary. Bishop Pompallier, who is a specially honoured pioneer of the New Zealand Catholic Church, arrived in the Hokianga from France in 1838 with a group of Marist Priests and Brothers. With this group, he sailed around New Zealand converting settlers to Catholicism in the early 1840s. Fathers Garin and Viard who accompanied Bishop Pompallier established churches in Howick and Panmure. Bishop Pompallier devised his own flag for the vessel ‚Äì a bunting version of the Miraculous Medal, It consisted of a blue cross surmounting a large M and surrounded by twelve stars. The background was white. These twelve stars have been incorporated into the school logo along with the Sancta Maria and the school's motto 'FAITH IS OUR COMPASS'. The College's name commemorates the historic arrival and work of Bishop Pompallier. There is a comparison between the vessel Sancta Maria being used to spread the Word and our College being a vessel for furthering the Religious Education of young people in the area. History Sancta Maria College was built in 2004 and was used as a 'transfer' school from St Mark's and Star of the Sea Primary schools in Howick and Pakuranga, New Zealand. There has been a notable increase in the population of students and the school has also been expanded to include 5 classroom 'blocks'. When Sancta Maria Catholic Primary School came in the year of 2010 they shared the same auditorium for assemblies and masses and so the college built a new gym for P.E. When it was first built, Sancta Maria College only supported students from Years 7‚Äì9, the same as Botany Downs Secondary College, due to lack of teaching space, but now it is a fully functional school from Years 7‚Äì13. Classrooms The school's construction of grouped classrooms has been divided up into 'blocks', named after Saints. Saint Anne Block is a three-story block with approximately 12 classrooms, which are used for the main social sciences, English and mathematics. Saint Benedict Block is a two-story block, with the top three classrooms being used for music and Information Communication Technology (ICT) Labs, as well as the Careers Office and the Guidance Counselor's Office, new built library the Dean of Year Level's offices and a few small meeting rooms. The next block is the Saint Catherine Block. The Saint Catherine Block, along with the Saint Benedict Block, were the first two blocks of classrooms in the foundation year. The Saint Catherine Block's top level is mainly for the sciences with five classrooms equipped for experiments and of the other four, three of which are being used for religious educations lessons and the final one is for languages (specifically Japanese). The bottom 10 classrooms are devoted to the technologies, with the first being information communication technology, with 30 flat screen computers into which students login using their own user id, the next adjoining classroom is for fabric technology, such as sewing and designing. Then there is the spare technology room used for Early Childhood Education, and the next is for food technology, which is used for cooking and baking. Next is the design technology room which is graphics, construction design, which in the future may incorporate CADD. After that is the building technology room, with woodwork and metalwork and electronics classrooms. The fourth block is Saint Dominic Block, which houses Year 7 and Year 8 students. Between every two classrooms is a 'pod' with approximately 10‚Äì15 computers for the classes to use if needed. The only exception is the last half of the bottom level which splits between art and languages, and the last third of the top level which is for 'Business Studies', or economics and accounting. A new two-story library has been constructed along with a set of new tennis courts for student use. A new gymnasium equipped with a fitness centre and physical education offices was opened in 2010. There is also an auditorium which is used for assemblies and other large events or gatherings. The school chapel and priest's office are also in the building complex with the auditorium. The chapel displays the icon which was specifically painted for Sancta Maria College. The administration building houses the sick bay, cashier's office, reception desk, meeting rooms, staff room and staff offices. Both Anne and Catherine blocks are equipped with a set of COW's (Computers On Wheels) for individual student use. From February to August 2017, construction took place under the school library. This was so that the lower story of the library could be converted into a Modern Learning Environment, to be used exclusively by the Religious Education department of the school. Current plans are for the block to be named 'Saint Francis Block'. Saint Francis Block can hold four classes at a time, and will be a shared space for all year levels. Education Sancta Maria College offers NCEA as its national qualifications standard and each year students results are significantly higher than national averages.

For most of the program's run, it aired from 7:30 to 7:45 Eastern Time on Tuesday and Thursday nights, rounding out the time slot which featured the network's regular evening newscast (John Cameron Swayze's Camel News Caravan), which, like all such programs of the era, was then only 15 minutes in length. Overview The program, broadcast live, was hosted by namesake actress and singer Dinah Shore, who had come to prominence in her home state as a radio singer and the first Jewish cheerleader at Vanderbilt University before being \\"discovered\\" and subsequently appearing on national radio and feature films. She made a relatively easy transition to TV, as noted by the length of this program's run. The series had an annual summer replacement show as was the case with many live musical and variety programs of the era. During this program's final season, it was reduced to appearing on Thursday nights only, with the Tuesday night slot going to The Jonathan Winters Show. However, during this season, Shore was given an opportunity to host a full hour-long variety show on Friday nights, The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, which was to run, on varying nights and timeslots, for a total of seven seasons. The 15-minute Thursday night program was discontinued following the 1956-57 season, along with all other such series (although network evening newscasts were not expanded to the half-hour format until 1963). Reception In 1951, media critic John Crosby commented, \\"The Dinah Shore Show is a triumph of simplicity\\", \\"it is the most intelligently thought out show that has yet come east from Hollywood\\" (at the time, Hollywood produced shows were generally held in far lower regard than New York City produced shows), and said \\"it's a very pretty show to watch\\". Hal Webman, in the December 8, 1951, edition of Billboard Magazine, praised writer, producer, director Alan Handley for picking \\"just the right camera angles with which properly to make Dinah appear so agreeable visually\\", for giving the episode reviewed a \\"whirlwind pace\\" and noted he \\"mercifully confined the Chevrolet commercials to one extremely effective filmed bit, and thus maintained the steady drive, flow and pacing of the entertainment portions of the show\\". Publisher Bob Lanigan in the March 9, 1952, edition of Brooklyn Eagle said \\"time has justified the original bouquets thrown at Dinah\\" and commented on the \\"elaborate and highly individual production numbers which would do justice to any high-budget, one-hour TV variety show\\".http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%205%2FBrooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle%201952%20Grayscale/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Eagle%201952%20Grayscale%20-%201879.pdf References *Brooks, Tim and Marsh, Earle, The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows External links  Ten public domain episodes on the Internet Archive: January 1 1952, First song: \\"Just One of Those Things\\", First song: \\"It's A Lovely Day Today\\", First song: \\"Undecided\\", First song: \\"On the Sunny Side Of The Street\\", October 8 1953, First song: \\"Red Canary\\", March 17 1953, November 26 1953, December 3 1953, Category:1951 American television series debuts Category:1956 American television series endings Category:1950s American variety television series Category:Black-and- white American television shows Category:English-language television shows Category:NBC original programming ","title":"The Dinah Shore Show"},{"id":"7978072","text":"Jewish Bolshevism, also Judeo‚ÄìBolshevism, is an anti-communist and antisemitic canard, which alleges that the Jews were the originators of the Russian Revolution in 1917, and that they held primary power among the Bolsheviks who led the revolution. Similarly, the conspiracy theory of Jewish Communism alleges that Jews have dominated the Communist movements in the world, and is related to The Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory (ZOG), which alleges that Jews control world politics. In 1917, after the Russian Revolution, the antisemitic canard was the title of the pamphlet, The Jewish Bolshevism, which featured in the racist propaganda of the anti-communist White movement forces during the Russian Civil War (1918‚Äì1922). During the 1930s, the Nazi Party in Germany and the German American Bund in the United States propagated the antisemitic theory to their followers, sympathisers, and fellow travellers. In Poland, \\"≈ªydokomuna\\" was a term for the antisemitic opinion that the Jews had a disproportionately high influence in the administration of the Communist Poland. In far-right politics, the antisemitic canards of \\"Jewish Bolshevism\\", \\"Jewish Communism\\", and the \\"Zionist Occupation Government\\" (ZOG) conspiracy theory are catchwords falsely asserting that Communism is a Jewish conspiracy. Origins White movement propaganda poster from the Russian Civil War era (1919), a caricature of Leon Trotsky, who was viewed as a symbol of Jewish Bolshevism. The conflation of Jews and revolution emerged in the atmosphere of destruction of Russia during World War I. When the revolutions of 1917 crippled Russia's war effort, conspiracy theories developed far from Berlin and Petrograd. Many Britons for example ascribed the Russian Revolution to an \\"apparent conjunction of Bolsheviks, Germans and Jews\\".Fromkin (2009) pp. 247‚Äì248. By December 1917, only five of the twenty-one members of the Communist Central Committee were Jews: the commissar for foreign affairs, the president of the Supreme Soviet, the deputy chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, the president of Petrograd Soviet, and the deputy director of the Cheka secret police. The worldwide spread of the concept in the 1920s is associated with the publication and circulation of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fraudulent document that purported to describe a secret Jewish conspiracy aimed at world domination. The expression made an issue out of the Jewishness of some leading Bolsheviks (such as Leon Trotsky) during and after the October Revolution. Daniel Pipes said that \\"primarily through The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the Whites spread these charges to an international audience.\\" James Webb wrote that it is rare to find an antisemitic source after 1917 that \\"does not stand in debt to the White Russian analysis of the Revolution\\". Jewish involvement in Russian Communism Antisemitism in the Russian Empire existed both culturally and institutionally. The Jews were restricted to live within the Pale of Settlement, and suffered pogroms. As a result, many Jews supported gradual or revolutionary changes within the Russian Empire. Those movements ranged among the far left (Jewish Anarchism, Bundists, Bolsheviks, Mensheviks,) and moderate left (Trudoviks) and constitutionalist (Constitutional Democrats) parties. According to the 1922 Bolshevik party census, there were 19,564 Jewish Bolsheviks, comprising 5.21% of the total, and in the 1920s of the 417 members of the Central Executive Committee, the party Central Committee, the Presidium of the Executive of the Soviets of the USSR and the Russian Republic, the People's Commissars, 6% were ethnic Jews. Between 1936 and 1940, during the Great Purge, Yezhovshchina and after the rapprochement with Nazi Germany, Stalin had largely eliminated Jews from senior party, government, diplomatic, security and military positions. Some scholars have grossly exaggerated Jewish presence in the Soviet Communist Party. For example, Alfred Jensen said that in the 1920s \\"75 per cent of the leading Bolsheviks\\" were \\"of Jewish origin\\". According to Aaronovitch, \\"a cursory examination of membership of the top committees shows this figure to be an absurd exaggeration\\". In 2013, speaking about the Schneerson Collection at the Moscow Jewish Museum and the Center for Tolerance, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that > \\"The decision to nationalize the library was made by the first Soviet > government, and Jews were approximately 80‚Äì85% members\\". According to historian Vladimir Ryzhkov, Putin's ignorant statement about the predominance of Jews in the Council of People's Commissars is due to the fact that \\"during the years of perestroika, he read the tabloid press\\". Some media outlets also criticized the statements of the President of the Russian Federation. So the editors of the newspaper Vedomosti, condemning the head of state for marginality, posted the following statistics: > \\"If we discard the speculations of pseudoscientists who know how to find the > Jewish origin of every revolutionary, it turns out that in the first > composition of the Council of People's Commissars of Jews there were 8%: of > its 16 members, only Leon Trotsky was a Jew. In the government of the > Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic of 1917‚Äì1922 Jews were 12% (six > out of 50 people). Apart from the government, the Central Committee of the > Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) on the eve of October > 1917 had 20% Jews (6 out of 30), and in the first composition of the > political bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party > (Bolsheviks) ‚Äì 40% (3 out of 7)\\".‚Äî Vedomosti (dated 17 June 2013). Nazi Germany Wochenspruch der NSDAP of 28 September 1941, accuses Jews of creating Marxism Walter Laqueur traces the Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy theory to Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg, for whom Bolshevism was \\"the revolt of the Jewish, Slavic and Mongolian races against the German (Aryan) element in Russia\\". Germans, according to Rosenberg, had been responsible for Russia's historic achievements and had been sidelined by the Bolsheviks, who did not represent the interests of the Russian people, but instead those of its ethnic Jewish and Chinese population. Michael Kellogg, in his Ph.D. thesis, argues that the racist ideology of Nazis was to a significant extent influenced by White √©migr√©s in Germany, many of whom, while being former subjects of the Russian Empire, were of non-Russian descent: ethnic Germans, residents of Baltic lands including Baltic Germans, and Ukrainians. Of particular role was their Aufbau organization (Aufbau: Wirtschafts-politische Vereinigung f√ºr den Osten (Reconstruction: Economic-Political Organization for the East)). For example, its leader was instrumental in making The Protocols of The Elders of Zion available in German language. He argues that early Hitler was rather philosemitic, and became rabidly antisemitic since 1919 under the influence of the White √©migr√© convictions about the conspiracy of the Jews, an unseen unity from financial capitalists to Bolsheviks, to conquer the world. Therefore, his conclusion is that White √©migr√©s were at the source of the Nazi concept of Jewish Bolshevism. Annemarie Sammartino argues that this view is contestable. While there is no doubt that White emigres were instrumental in reinforcing the idea of 'Jewish Bolshevism' among Nazis, the concept is also found in many German early post‚ÄìWorld War I documents. Also, Germany had its own share of Jewish Communists \\"to provide fodder for the paranoid fantasies of German antisemites\\" without Russian Bolsheviks. During the 1920s, Hitler declared that the mission of the Nazi movement was to destroy \\"Jewish Bolshevism\\". Hitler asserted that the \\"three vices\\" of \\"Jewish Marxism\\" were democracy, pacifism and internationalism, and that the Jews were behind Bolshevism, communism and Marxism. In Nazi Germany, this concept of Jewish Bolshevism reflected a common perception that Communism was a Jewish-inspired and Jewish- led movement seeking world domination from its origin. The term was popularized in print in German journalist Dietrich Eckhart's 1924 pamphlet \\"\\" (\\"Bolshevism from Moses to Lenin\\") which depicted Moses and Lenin as both being Communists and Jews. This was followed by Alfred Rosenberg's 1923 edition of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and Hitler's Mein Kampf in 1925, which saw Bolshevism as \\"Jewry's twentieth century effort to take world dominion unto itself\\". According to French spymaster and writer Henri Rollin, \\"Hitlerism\\" was based on \\"anti-Soviet counter-revolution\\" promoting the \\"myth of a mysterious Jewish‚ÄìMasonic‚ÄìBolshevik plot\\", entailing that the First World War had been instigated by a vast Jewish‚ÄìMasonic conspiracy to topple the Russian, German, and Austro-Hungarian Empires and implement Bolshevism by fomenting liberal ideas. A major source for propaganda about Jewish Bolshevism in the 1930s and early 1940s was the pro-Nazi and antisemitic international Welt-Dienst news agency founded in 1933 by Ulrich Fleischhauer. Within the German Army, a tendency to see Soviet Communism as a Jewish conspiracy had grown since the First World War, something that became officialized under the Nazis. A 1932 pamphlet by Ewald Banse of the Government-financed German National Association for the Military Sciences described the Soviet leadership as mostly Jewish, dominating an apathetic and mindless Russian population. German antisemitic and anti-Soviet propaganda poster, written in the Polish language. The text reads \\"Death! to Jewish-Bolshevik pestilence of murdering!\\" Propaganda produced in 1935 by the psychological war laboratory of the German War Ministry described Soviet officials as \\"mostly filthy Jews\\" and called on Red Army soldiers to rise up and kill their \\"Jewish commissars\\". This material was not used at the time, but served as a basis for propaganda in the 1940s. Members of the SS were encouraged to fight against the \\"Jewish Bolshevik sub- humans\\". In the pamphlet The SS as an Anti-Bolshevist Fighting Organization, published in 1936, Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler wrote: In his speech to the Reichstag justifying Operation Barbarossa in 1941, Hitler said: Field- Marshal Wilhelm Keitel gave an order on 12 September 1941 which declared: \\"the struggle against Bolshevism demands ruthless and energetic, rigorous action above all against the Jews, the main carriers of Bolshevism\\". Historian Richard J. Evans wrote that Wehrmacht officers regarded the Russians as \\"sub- human\\", and were from the time of the invasion of Poland in 1939 telling their troops the war was caused by \\"Jewish vermin\\", explaining to the troops that the war against the Soviet Union was a war to wipe out what were variously described as \\"Jewish Bolshevik subhumans\\", the \\"Mongol hordes\\", the \\"Asiatic flood\\" and the \\"red beast\\", language clearly intended to produce war crimes by reducing the enemy to something less than human. Joseph Goebbels published an article in 1942 called \\"the so-called Russian soul\\" in which he claimed that Bolshevism was exploiting the Slavs and that the battle of the Soviet Union determined whether Europe would become under complete control by international Jewry. Nazi propaganda presented Barbarossa as an ideological-racial war between German National Socialism and \\"Judeo-Bolshevism\\", dehumanising the Soviet enemy as a force of Slavic Untermensch (sub-humans) and \\"Asiatic\\" savages engaging in \\"barbaric Asiatic fighting methods\\" commanded by evil Jewish commissars whom German troops were to grant no mercy. The vast majority of the Wehrmacht officers and soldiers tended to regard the war in Nazi terms, seeing their Soviet opponents as sub-human. Outside Nazi Germany =Great Britain, 1920s= In the early 1920s, a leading British antisemite, Henry Hamilton Beamish, stated that Bolshevism was the same thing as Judaism. In the same decade, future wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill penned an editorial entitled \\"Zionism versus Bolshevism\\", which was published in the Illustrated Sunday Herald. In the article, which asserted that Zionism and Bolshevism were engaged in a \\"struggle for the soul of the Jewish people\\", he called on Jews to repudiate \\"the Bolshevik conspiracy\\" and make clear that \\"the Bolshevik movement is not a Jewish movement\\" but stated that: > [Bolshevism] among the Jews is nothing new. From the days of Spartacus- > Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, and down to Trotsky (Russia), Bela Kun > (Hungary), Rosa Luxemburg (Germany), and Emma Goldman (United States), this > world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and for the > reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious > malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing. Author Gisela C. Lebzelter noted that Churchill's analysis failed to analyze the role that Russian oppression of Jews had played in their joining various revolutionary movements, but instead \\"to inherent inclinations rooted in Jewish character and religion\\". Works propagating the Jewish Bolshevism canard =The Octopus= The Octopus is a 256-page book self-published in 1940 by Elizabeth Dilling under the pseudonym \\"Rev. Frank Woodruff Johnson\\". In it she describes her theories of Jewish Bolshevism. =Behind Communism= Frank L. Britton, editor of The American Nationalist published a book, Behind Communism, in 1952 which disseminated the myth that Communism was a Jewish conspiracy originating in Palestine. Criticism of the Jewish Bolshevism canard Researchers in the field, such as Polish philosopher Stanis≈Çaw Krajewski Originally in a CEU annual Jewish Studies at the Central European University, ed. by Andras Kovacs, co-editor Eszter Andor, CEU 2000, 119‚Äì133 or Andr√© Gerrits, denounce the concept of Jewish Bolshevism as a prejudice. Law professor Ilya Somin agrees, and compares Jewish involvement in other communist countries. \\"Overrepresentation of a group in a political movement does not prove either that the movement was 'dominated' by that group or that it primarily serves that group's interests. The idea that communist oppression was somehow Jewish in nature is belied by the record of communist regimes in countries like China, North Korea, and Cambodia, where the Jewish presence was and is minuscule.\\" Several scholars have observed that Jewish involvement in Communist movements was primarily a response to antisemitism and rejection by established politics.Jaff Schatz, The Generation: The Rise and Fall of the Jewish Communists of Poland, University of California Press, 1991, p. 95.Jaff Schatz, \\"Jews and the Communist Movement in Interwar Poland,\\" in Jonathan Frankel, Dark Times, Dire Decisions: Jews and Communism: Studies in Contemporary Jewry , Oxford University Press US, 2005, p. 30.

These efforts bore fruit in 1974 when President Richard Nixon signed legislation to create the National Institute on Aging (NIA). In 1946, GSA began publishing Journal of Gerontology. In 1961, material in Journal of Gerontology dealing with GSA organization and activities was moved to a new journal called The Gerontologist. In 1988 Journal of Gerontology was renamed Journals of Gerontology to reflect the fact that it was a composite of four journals having four separate editors. In 1995, the four journals being published under one cover were split into two magazines (\\"two covers\\"): (1) the Journals of Gerontology: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences and (2) the Journals of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences.

Michael Piazza, then dean of the Cathedral. Donald Bruce Kaufman was consulted for the painting of the exterior. The building is ten stories high and complemented with a 78-foot bell tower commemoration of HIV/AIDS victims. The physical building is symbolic to the liberal Christian faith that hosts and is found in a considerably conservative area. The main building was completed in 2002, at a construction cost of approximately $20 million, and can accommodate up to 2,200 worshippers at once. Piazza was the senior pastor for nearly twenty years between the late 1980s and 1990s. He oversaw the largest growth in the church's history, from 250 members to more than 3,000, while ministering through the AIDS crisis. Other campuses are located in Mid-Cities (between Dallas and Fort Worth), and Oklahoma City. Its national outreach program reaches a further online audience nationwide.

Dedication of the building was on November 7, 2010. The Rev. Dr. Neil Cazares- Thomas has been the cathedral's senior pastor since May 2015. History On July 30, 1970, a group of twelve people gathered at a home at 4612 Victor Street in Dallas to discuss establishing a Metropolitan Community Church congregation. In May 1971, Richard Vincent was elected as the first pastor of MCC-Dallas. The group worshiped in homes for the first year and a half, using a coffee table as an altar. 2019 The cathedral of hope dallas church (17) In 1972, MCC-Dallas moved into its first church home at 3834 Ross Avenue. The building had been originally built as a small private hospital in the 1920s. In 1974, James Harris was elected as the church's second pastor. On October 4, 1976, MCC-Dallas purchased a former Church of Christ building at 2701 Regan, Dallas. In November 1977, Don Eastman was elected as the church's third pastor. At this time, the membership had grown to almost 400. Michael Piazza was elected senior pastor in November 1987 bringing in new members attracted by Piazza's preaching.Hodges, Sam (July 24, 2010). \\"Dallas' Cathedral of Hope, world's largest predominantly gay church, celebrates 40 years\\".

In late 1990, MCC-Dallas became the Cathedral of Hope MCC to reflect a new broader mission to reach out LGBT people everywhere with a message of hope. The church began its \\"Pink-Period\\" quest to build a larger church to accommodate a growing congregation. This new home was completed in 1992. That same year, the Christmas Eve service was broadcast on CNN. The congregation now approached 1,000 members. During 1993 the cathedral grows by a record 300 members. The Cathedral of Hope in 1995 commissioned the prominent architect Philip Johnson to design a new cathedral campus. Membership grew to over 2,300 by 1998 and the cathedral served a rapidly growing congregation of more than 3,000. In 1999, CoH-TV begins hosting live Internet worship services via the cathedral's website. In 2000, the Cathedral of Hope began the \\"Century of Compassion\\" by donating more than one million dollars in direct assistance and volunteer community support annually. On July 30, 2000, the John Thomas Bell Wall, a National AIDS Memorial, was dedicated. The church saw more than 1,500 AIDS funerals and memorial services. On August 6, 2000, nearly 100 people attended the inaugural worship service at the Cathedral of Hope ‚Äì Oklahoma City. On July 28, 2002, the newly completed Congregational Life Center was dedicated.

In April 2003, Frey filed a complaint with MCC that prompted the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches to open an investigation against Michael Piazza. In July 2003, believing the investigators had overstepped their bounds, the church's board called for a vote to disaffiliate from the denomination, which passed with 88 percent support,http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/fallen-angel-6386866 effectively ending the UFMCC investigation. Piazza took a three-month sabbatical after the vote. Half of those who voted to remain affiliated with the MCC denomination formed their own church known as MCC of Greater Dallas with pastor Cindi Love. On February 6, 2005, Jo Hudson was elected as senior pastor of the Cathedral of Hope. Michael Piazza became dean of the cathedral. In 2005, the church celebrated 35 years of ministry and activism. It launched a capital campaign to build the next phase of Philip Johnson's campus design, an interfaith peace chapel. The church launched a new non-profit organization, Hope for Peace & Justice, with Michael Piazza as president. In October 2006, the Cathedral of Hope was granted standing by the North Texas Association of the United Church of Christ (UCC) as a member congregation, becoming the fourth largest congregation in the denomination. The Cathedral of Hope's Interfaith Peace Chapel began construction in 2009 and was completed in November 2010. In July 2010 the Cathedral of Hope's 4000 members celebrated its 40th anniversary. Jo Hudson resigned to pursue other ministry opportunities on May 19, 2013. Jim Mitulski became the interim senior pastor on August 1.

She was one of the companions of Muhammad. Life A member of the Banu Najjar tribe living in Medina, Nusaybah was the sister of Abdullah bin K'ab, and the mother of Abdullah and Habib ibn Zayd al-Ansari. When 74 leaders, warriors, and statesmen of Medina descended on al-Aqabah to swear an oath of allegiance to Islam following the teaching of the new religion by Mus\`ab ibn \`Umair in the city, Nusaybah and Umm Munee Asma bint  øAmr bin 'Adi were the only two women to personally pledge directly to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The latter's husband, Ghazyah bin  øAmr, informed Muhammad that the women also wanted to give their bayah in person, and he agreed. She returned to Medina and began teaching Islam to the women of the city. This bayah or pledge was the de facto handing over of power to Muhammad over the city, by its key figures. Her most renowned role came in the battle of Uhud, where she defended the prophet. She also participated in the battle of Hunain, Yamamah and the Treaty of Hudaybia. Her two sons, both later martyr in battle, were from her first marriage to Zaid bin  øAsim Mazni. She later married bin  øAmr, and had another son Tameem and a daughter Khawlah.

As a composer, he co-wrote the band's first single \\"Enveloped Ideas\\" and their well-known hit \\"Salamat\\", which was released posthumously in 1989.The Dawn - Enveloped Ideas at Opm Tunes He played guitar on the albums The Dawn (1986) and I Stand With You (1988). Aside from being a guitarist, he played keyboards as credited on The Dawn's 1986 debut album. At the height of his career and at the peak of The Dawn's popularity in the late 1980s, he was stabbed to death in front of his girlfriend's house by two bystanders who were allegedly under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Early life Diaz's father is Filipino actor Vic Diaz of Sampaguita Pictures fame; his grandfather is Pompeyo Diaz, a judge. His godfather is Fernando Poe, Jr. who was the \\"King of Philippine Movies\\". Diaz was born on April Fools' Day, and was often teased because of this. He was the first grandchild on both sides of his family. Diaz had two brothers, Carl and Loren. Diaz spent both grade school and high school in his father and grandfather's alma mater, Ateneo de Manila University. After graduating from high school, he enrolled at the University of the Philippines where he studied Architecture for three years. He transferred to the Philippine Women's University after his third year in UP and took up Music, with guitar as his major. Aside from being a musician, Diaz was also gifted with a talent in drawing. He would spend time with Fine Arts students in PWU, and would draw comic book characters and different electric guitar designs for relaxation. Career The Dawn was formed in 1985 and originally consisted of Diaz on guitar, JB Leonor on drums and Clay Luna on bass. The band's name was derived from a portrait of the Holy Spirit that symbolized the dawn of a new day (probably found in a book given by the Sisters of the Holy Spirit to Teddy Diaz, as well as a crucifix which Teddy also received from the same sisterhood), called The Dawning of the Holy Spirit. Diaz, Leonor and Luna initially wanted a female vocalist but in the course of their search, Jett Pangan auditioned, got the trio's unanimous nod and the quartet started performing in clubs. In 1987, he co-wrote The Dawn's debut single \\"Enveloped Ideas\\", as Orly Ilacad of Octo Arts gave them the necessary breakthrough by releasing their single and 12\\" EP of the single. \\"Radio\\", from their 2005 album A Brighter Day, was originally arranged by Diaz in 1987. The arrangement of the Filipino traditional folk song, \\"Magtanim Ay 'Di Biro\\" was also credited to Diaz. Other songs which Teddy wrote or co-wrote were \\"Dreams\\"The Dawn - Dreams at Opm Tunes and \\"The Moon\\". INTRoVOYS was mentored by Diaz. Before his death, he became friends with Francis Reyes (who later joined the band as a guitarist) where they even spoke of forming a thrash metal side project with drummer JB Leonor's brother, Dennis. Death On 21 August 1988, The Dawn performed \\"Love (Will Set Us Free)\\" on Martin After Dark, a show hosted by Martin Nievera. After the performance, they left the GMA Network compound and went their separate ways. Diaz proceeded to his girlfriend's home in Agno Street, Tatalon, Quezon City. As he was approaching the gate to the dwelling, he was accosted by two drunken men. Diaz gave them his wallet containing Php 200.00, his share of the fee from the band's earlier performance. After taking the wallet, one of the men, who was armed with a knife, began stabbing Diaz. Wounds on Diaz's left arm indicated that he may have tried to parry the blows, but a knife thrust to his throat caused massive bleeding, eventually leading to his death. Drummer JB Leonor explained: \\"With his long hair, Teddy might have been mistaken for a woman, an easy prey. Teddy might have resisted at some point, and that's why they stabbed him. He was really a victim of circumstance. He just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.\\" Diaz's murderer was apprehended by police a week later, tried in court, convicted and remanded to the custody of authorities at the New Bilibid Prison. Members of The Dawn state that the convict had since died in incarceration. The first decision of the three surviving members and band's manager Martin Galan was to continue with the band; they also agreed that Diaz's replacement would not have to be his clone. In September 1988, Francis Reyes was asked to be one of the three guitarists who were to play Diaz's parts in the tribute concert \\"Salamat Teddy\\" at the Folk Arts Theater. Reyes talked about Diaz and said: \\"People continue to remember Teddy. He had star quality written all over him that registered very well even with those who didn't know him as a musician. He had a very strong personality that you just can't ignore.\\" Legacy In spite of his early demise, his influence is still felt among many guitarists in the Philippines today and he has become a legend among many Filipino musicians. The Dawn, and the Filipino music industry also consider Diaz to be the band's driving force until today. In memory of Diaz, The Dawn has recorded a song that pays tribute to him: \\"I Stand with You\\". Perfecto de Castro, former guitarist of Rivermaya, was inspired to study the guitar upon seeing Diaz perform with The Dawn at a concert in 1987. Former AfterImage guitarist and 6Cycle Mind's founding lead guitarist Chuck Isidro is also influenced by Diaz. He treasures a poster of Diaz kept in his room, which he got during his pre-teen years. In 2006, a photo, features Francis Reyes playing Diaz's last surviving Hofner guitar. Former Eraserheads bassist, Buddy Zabala, describes Diaz's death as a \\"great loss, and after a band made a success out of creating homegrown music, other local bands started writing their own material. But it was Teddy who was the prime mover of The Dawn\\". In 2006, he was portrayed by actor Ping Medina.  Guitars The guitars most associated with Diaz are his red Casio MG-510, his Hofner Committee archtop, and his black Maya Les Paul, which he prominently used in the Ultrastorm concert with a bow in 1987 See also * The Dawn * Jett Pangan * Pinoy rock References External links *Official website of The Dawn Category:1963 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Filipino guitarists Category:Filipino songwriters Category:Lead guitarists Category:Murdered musicians Teddy Category:People murdered in the Philippines Category:20th-century guitarists Category:Philippine Women's University alumni Category:People from Manila Category:1980s murders in the Philippines Category:1988 murders in Asia Category:1988 crimes in the Philippines ","title":"Teddy Diaz"},{"id":"7978321","text":"A Place Like This is Robbie Nevil's second album, released in 1988.

The MTV was designed as a solution to shortcomings in the current, decade-old Interceptor Body Armor (IBA) and was selected after a rigorous proposal and examination process by the Marine Corps. The MTV provides better protection levels than the IBA, although it uses the same Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) plates. The MTV weighs , three pounds more than the IBA, but is designed to more effectively distribute its weight throughout the wearer's torso. The Navy also ordered 28,000 MTVs in August 2008.  History  After conducting a survey of more than 1,000 Marines and finding that a majority of the Marine Corps had been overall highly satisfied with the MTV, in January 2009 the Marine Corps announced that it would be making some modifications to the MTV to improve comfort, mobility and safety. The Marine Corps awarded a major contract to Protective Products International (subsidiary of Protective Products of America) to produce 60,000 vests, and began fielding them in 2007 and a continued roll-out is expected. The Navy also ordered 28,364 MTVs in August 2008.Defense contracts August 07, 2008 \\"Protective Products International, Sunrise, Fla., is being awarded a $17,395,304 delivery order #0003 under a previously awarded firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract (M67854-07-D-3065) for 28,364 MTVs (modular tactical vests) and associated new equipment training. Work will be performed in Sunrise, Fla., (60 percent); Granite Falls, N.C., (30 percent); and Fenton, Mo., (10 percent), and work is expected to be completed October 2009. Contract funds in the amount of $17,395,304 will expire at the end of the current fiscal year. This contract was a sole source award. The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Va., is the contracting activity.\\"  Design  An MTV broken down into its basic components The MTV includes the following features: * Quick-release system to remove the vest in emergencies, meant to help corpsmen get to an injured Marine's body. Troops complained that the pull string got caught on equipment and the MTV would accidentally fall off in the middle of battle. * Greater coverage of the lower back, side torso, and shoulders. * Integrated side SAPI pouches. * Integrated channels for communications wiring. * Rifle bolster to assist in seating the wearer's rifle. * Same modular PALS webbing as the Interceptor. * A changed closure system. This was intended to be an improvement, but some wearers have complained that it takes too long to put on because the vest slips over the head. An updated version of the MTV is currently in production to address these issues. The vest is donned and doffed using a hook-and-pile \\"cummerbund,\\" which fastens around the waist, and a buckle atop each shoulder. Some users have complained that the vest is more time-consuming to don (especially with a full combat load attached) when compared to the Interceptor's single hook-and-loop flap. The quick-release system was designed in response to concerns that the Interceptor was difficult for medical personnel to remove from incapacitated troops, and in some cases had to be cut off. When pulled firmly, a cord at the bottom of the vest causes the cummerbund to separate into two pieces. The shoulder buckles can then be unfastened and the vest removed in pieces, with no need to change the casualty's body position. = Improved Modular Tactical Vest = In July 2013, the Marine Corps announced it will buy 3,800 Improved Modular Tactical Vests. The IMTV is made for smaller stature Marines who cannot wear the full-sized MTV comfortably. The vest comes in small-short, medium-short, and large-short sizes. Most Marines use the Scalable Plate Carrier in the field, so it is hoped that the additional sizes will encourage Marines to wear the IMTV in combat. The Corps does not want to design female-specific body armor, and has found that the issue was different statures related to the length of the torso. The IMTV can fit women, as well as smaller stature men.Corps Buys Body Armor for Shorter Marines - Kitup.military.com, 3 July 2013  Protection offered  The vest itself has slots for NIJ Level 3A analogue (it is not tested against .44 SWC) kevlar soft armor inserts, with additional slots for hard armor plates, in this case the Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts.https://www.military.com/equipment/modular-tactical-vest The ESAPI Rev G, the latest model of such armor plates will protect the wearer against two rounds of .30-06 M2AP at 868 meters per second, and will also stop multiple hits of lesser threats such as 5.56√ó45mm NATO, 7.62√ó51mm NATO, and 7.62√ó39mm. This is opposed to Rev A versions, which would stop M2AP 1.6 times, once with complete confidence, and a second one 60% of the time.

It was founded as a school for boys by Colonel L. E. Allen and General T. L. Alexander in 1959 and classes began with the 1960‚Äì61 school year. There were a total of 23 senior classes. In 1971 the school became fully co-educational. The campus was situated on . The school was closed in 1983.  History  The main school building was a Victorian structure with steep roof lines and large chimneys. The building was originally four stories and had 230 rooms. Carl Dann Sr. built it in 1926 during the Florida land boom. It was called the Mt. Plymouth Hotel and Country Club. At one time it had the largest dining room in Florida. The golf course was modeled after St. Andrews Golf Club in Scotland. The last class graduated in May, 1983. A few weeks later, the school was seized by United States bankruptcy court, prior to the settlement of claims from 330 of the school's creditors. The school was closed and all business transactions were halted. The building was condemned and abandoned, and vandals destroyed much of the structure. In 1986, the entire building except for one wing burned to the ground. Shortly thereafter the entire site was razed, with no trace of the building left. It has recently been designated a National Historical Site.

The hurricane made landfall in the Outer Banks of North Carolina on September 18\\\\. There, storm surge flooding and strong winds damaged thousands of houses. The storm surge produced a 2,000 foot (600 m) wide inlet on Hatteras Island, isolating Hatteras by road for two months. Several locations along North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed out or covered with debris. Hurricane Isabel produced hurricane-force wind gusts across eastern North Carolina, knocking down trees and power lines. About 700,000 residents lost power due to the storm, although most outages were restored within a few days. The hurricane killed three people in the state - two due to falling trees, and the other a utility worker attempting to restore electricity. Damage in the state totaled $450 million (2003 USD, $ USD). The National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch, and later warning, for the state's coastline in advance of the hurricane's landfall. Local officials issued evacuation orders for 18 counties, along with various flood warnings. In the aftermath of the hurricane, then-President George W. Bush declared a state of emergency for 26 counties in the state, which allocated federal resources to the state. Utility crews from nearby states helped restore power. The United States Geological Survey dredged sand to restore the breach on Hatteras Island, with traffic restored about two months after the hurricane. Preparations On September 14 - four days before Hurricane Isabel made landfall - most computer models predicted that Isabel would strike the east coast of the United States between North Carolina and New Jersey. The National Hurricane Center consistently forecast a landfall on North Carolina. Forecasters initially predicted a landfall in the northeastern portion of the state, which became more accurate as the hurricane neared land. Strong confidence in Isabel's final landfall prompted the National Hurricane Center to issue a hurricane watch for the entire North Carolina coastline about 50 hours before Isabel struck land. About 12 hours later, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning from Cape Fear to the North Carolina/Virginia border, with a tropical storm warning extending southward to South Carolina. The Newport Weather Forecast Office warned for the potential of flash flooding. The office began preparing for the hurricane one week before landfall, and brought additional staff members to assist with hurricane related duties. On September 16, officials issued a voluntary Evacuation for portions of four counties and one entire county. By around 24 hours before landfall, mandatory evacuations were ordered for eight counties, including the state's coastal counties from Cape Fear to the North Carolina/Virginia border. Despite being under a mandatory evacuation, 57% of Outer Banks residents chose not to leave, as well as 77% of residents in storm surge-prone areas of the Pamlico Sound; this was based on a survey taken after the hurricane. Residents who evacuated their homes cited the hurricane's strength and track, as well as statements from officials, as the main reasons for leaving. Evacuees utilized the house of a friend or relative, or a public shelter. Issues related to the evacuations included traffic problems, stalled cars along roads, inadequate route signing, and flooded or damaged roads. By the morning of the hurricane's landfall, 65 shelters were prepared with a capacity of 95,000 people. The American Red Cross prepared 100 feeding vehicles in staging areas, and deployed two mobile kitchens each with the capacity to provide 10,000 meals per day. Additionally, five Southern Baptist Convention kitchens were on standby, in total being able to provide 20,000 meals per day. Impact Storm tides related to Isabel in the state Hurricane Isabel produced hurricane-force wind gusts throughout eastern North Carolina. The winds downed hundreds of trees, leaving about 700,000 people without power across the state. Damage from the hurricane totaled about $450 million (2003 USD, ($ USD)). Three people were killed in the state - a utility worker attempting to restore electricity and two by falling trees. =Outer Banks= Damage to the Barrier Islands after Hurricane Isabel (USGS) Hurricane Isabel first began affecting North Carolina about 15 hours before it struck land. Upon making landfall along the Outer Banks, the hurricane produced strong waves of 15 to 25 feet (4.5 to 6 m) in height and a storm surge of about 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m). Storm tides along the coast peaked at 7.7 feet (2.3 m) in Cape Hatteras, though the total could be higher there due to the tide gauge being destroyed by the hurricane. Rough surf and storm surge caused overwash and severe beach erosion throughout the Outer Banks, with flooding in Ocracoke reportedly being up to waist-high. The high waters washed out a 2,000 feet (600 m) portion of Hatteras Island between Hatteras and Frisco, creating a new inlet unofficially dubbed Isabel Inlet. The break was 15 feet (5 m) deep in areas, consisting of three distinct channels. The new inlet washed away all utility connections to Hatteras Village, including power lines and water pipes, as well as dunes, three houses, and a portion of North Carolina Highway 12. The storm surge and waves from Isabel resulted in another breach between Hatteras and Hatteras Inlet, in an area without roads or houses. The breach nearly became an inlet, though it was not deep enough for a constant water flow; it had little impact on residents. In addition to the floodwaters, Isabel produced an estimated 4 inches (100 mm) of rain throughout most of the Outer Banks, with Duck reporting a peak of 4.72 inches (120 mm). Wind gusts in association with the hurricane peaked at 105 mph (170 km/h) in Ocracoke, with several other locations reporting hurricane-force gusts. Wind and water damage across the Outer Banks was extensive, with monetary damage in Dare County estimated at $350 million (2003 USD, ($ USD)). Strong waves and the storm surge from Hurricane Isabel knocked 30-40 houses and several motels off of their pilings. Two families who did not evacuate were nearly swept out to sea when their home was destroyed; they reached safety despite local rescue being unable to reach them. The rough waves damaged piers in Nags Head, Rodanthe, and Frisco, with three completely destroyed. Several locations along North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed out or covered with debris, and 15 foot (4.5 m) sections of pavement on both sides of a bridge near Ocracoke were washed away. Strong waves destroyed a beach access ramp. Several thousand homes and businesses were damaged by the passage of the hurricane, but no deaths or injuries were reported in the Outer Banks. =Southeast North Carolina= Destroyed house on the Outer Banks Southwest of were Isabel moved ashore, Isabel's effects were lighter than in the Outer Banks. Sustained winds along the coast reached 45 mph (72 km/h) at the Wilmington International Airport, with gusts to 66 mph (106 km/h) at a port facility in Wilmington. The large circulation of Isabel dropped moderate rainfall across the area, peaking at 4.51 inches (115 mm) in Whiteville. Weather radars estimated over 5 inches (125 mm) of precipitation fell in portions of New Hanover County. The rainfall collected into ponds roadways, though no severe flooding was reported. Storm tides were generally around 1 foot (0.3 m) above normal, though Wilmington reported a storm tide of 3.22 feet (1 m). Rough waves resulted in moderate beach erosion near Cape Fear and minor erosion along eastward-facing beaches north of Cape Fear. Damage was minor in southeast North Carolina. Moderate winds inflicted isolated shingle and siding damage along barrier islands. The winds downed several trees, some onto cars and houses. Brief power outages were also reported. Beach erosion damaged a bridge in Bald Head Island. In Chowan County, a business parking lot was under several feet of water due to flash flooding. One person died in Carteret County while trying to restore electricity. =Inland= Radar image of Isabel making landfall Isabel produced strong winds throughout inland areas of eastern North Carolina. Plymouth, located 75 miles (120 km) from the hurricane's landfall, reported gusts to 95 mph (155 km/h). Sustained winds were lighter, with only a few locations receiving tropical storm strength winds. Tropical storm force wind gusts were reported as far inland as Lumberton, where gusts reached 52 mph (54 km/h). The passage of the hurricane resulted in moderate rainfall of up to 6.02 inches (153 mm) in Havelock. Upon making landfall, Isabel produced moderate to severe storm surges along the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers, with a location in Craven County reporting a storm tide of 10.5 feet (3.2 m) above normal. The strong storm surge produced significant flooding in Harlowe and Oriental. Several other locations also reported flooding of streets and low-lying areas. The rise of water flooded many homes in Craven County and the eastern portions of Carteret and Pamlico counties. Emergency personnel rescues people who had not evacuated and became trapped by storm surge flooding. Eyewitnesses reported high velocity, waist deep water moving homes, trailers, and other objects many yards inland. As the water retreated, these objects were then dragged back towards the water. A 5 to 8 foot (1.5 to 2.4 m) storm surge struck the western portion of the Albemarle Sound, with significant surge flooding occurring to the west of Edenton. There, the surge destroyed four homes, two of which were moved up to off their concrete block foundations. Nearly 60 percent of all homes and business in Chowan County suffered some structural damage due to wind, many of which were the result of large falling trees. One woman died when a tree fell on her vehicle in Chowan County. Aftermath Counties declared as Disaster Areas Due to its impacts, the name \\"Isabel\\" was retired following its usage in 2003, meaning its name will not be used again for an Atlantic hurricane. Hundreds of residents were stranded in Hatteras following the formation of the new inlet created by rising waters. Many parts of North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed out, damaged, or reduced one lane, which slowed recovery efforts and the return of homeowners in the Outer Banks. The ferry between Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island was temporarily halted due to damage after the hurricane, though a small passenger ferry remained available for Hatteras Village residents and emergency workers. Non-residents were barred from being on the Outer Banks for two weeks after the hurricane. After the ban was lifted, visitors walked nearly 1 mi (1.6 km) to see the new Isabel Inlet. Officials considered building a bridge or ferry system across the new inlet, which were dropped in favor of pumping sand and filling the inlet. This was despite opposition from coastal geologists who stated that the evolution of the Outer Banks is dependent on inlets from hurricanes. Dredging operations began on October 17, using sand from the ferry channel to the southwest of Hatteras Island; this choice minimized impact to submerged aquatic vegetation. On November 22, about two months after the hurricane struck, Highway 12 and Hatteras Island were reopened to public access. On the same day, the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was reopened. The breach on the southern end of Hatteras Island was filled in with sand. Hardware stores experienced great demand for portable generators, chain saws, dehumidifiers, and air movers following the passage of the hurricane. Utility crews from across the country came to the state to assist in returning power, though power outages persisted for several days. Over 2,500 utility members worked, in some cases around the clock, to restore the power. One power company restored power to 68% of its affected customers by the day after Isabel passed through the area. By four days after landfall, 83,000 customers were without power, down from its peak of several hundred thousand. Hours after Isabel made landfall, then-President George W. Bush issued a major disaster declaration for 26 North Carolina counties. This was later expanded to 47 counties in the state. The order allocated federal funds for the long-term recovery of hurricane-stricken residents and business owners, as well as providing federal funds for the state and local governments to pay 75 percent of the eligible cost for debris removal and emergency services related to the hurricane, including requested emergency work undertaken by the federal government. The order also allowed for the use of federal personnel, equipment and lifesaving systems and the delivery of heavy-duty generators, plastic sheeting, tents, cots, food, water, medical aid and other essential supplies and materials for sustaining human life. By four days after the emergency declaration, assistance checks were first mailed and used by residents to pay for what was not covered by their insurance. By four days after landfall, FEMA served around 68,000 meals to displaced families. More than a dozen disaster recovery centers were initiated throughout the state. FEMA provided 125,000 pounds of ice in the first few days, and prepared 200,000 pounds of ice and 180,000 liters of water for the following week for the remaining communities without water. By six days after Isabel struck the state, all hospitals were opened and all roads excluding North Carolina Highway 12 were passable due to emergency crews clearing roads with debris. By 12 weeks after the hurricane passed through the state, 54,425 residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling $155.2 million (2003 USD, ($ USD)).

The series was sponsored by the Chevrolet Motor Division of General Motors and its theme song, sung by Shore, was \\"See the U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet\\", which continued to be used in Chevrolet advertising for several more years after the cancellation of the show. Synopsis The program began as a series of nine monthly specials substituting in the regular time slot of the Gillette Cavalcade of Sports. NBC first tested the singing star in an hour long format with two prime time specials early in 1956. The first Chevy Show episode aired on October 5, 1956, with Frank Sinatra as guest. By this time, Shore was already a veteran television performer, having hosted five seasons of the 15-minute-long Dinah Shore Show, also sustained by Chevrolet. It was in its final season (the final season for all 15-minute prime time network entertainment series) when The Dinah Shore Chevy Show was launched. The series featured celebrity guests from the worlds of music, theater, sports, and movies.The Dinah Shore Show at The Museum of Broadcast Communications During the fourth season, Carl Reiner was one of the show's writers and sometimes appeared on-camera as well, adding levity to a show which primarily focused on music. The program was well-received and renewed the following fall as a weekly Sunday night series, broadcast in color, where it remained until Bonanza, another Chevy sponsored hour, moved from Saturday at 7:30 p.m. into that time slot for the 1961-62 season. Dinah ended her decade-long association with Chevrolet in 1961 and returned as part of an alternating Friday night lineup, with the show retitled simply The Dinah Shore Show, with S & H Green Stamps becoming her primary sponsor. In her final season, from October 14, 1962, to May 12, 1963, she appeared on Sunday nights at 10 p.m. following Bonanza. After 12 years with NBC, Dinah signed with ABC-TV in the fall of 1964 hosting four hour long specials sponsored by Purex. In 1970 Dinah Shore returned as a staple of American television in various daytime talk shows for NBC and syndication for more than twenty years after the conclusion of this series. The show won four Emmy Awards during its run. Beginning in 2011 black- and-white kinescope episodes of the series aired on the Jewish Life Television network. Original color videotape episodes were added to the JLTV line up in 2015. This run concluded in 2017.

These are applicable both to utility-supplied natural gas and to gas from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). These small devices are installed on the property gas meter (usually between the utility company's metered installation and the structure piping) and are designed to instantly stop the natural gas supply in order to protect the structure if a gas leak or line break occurs during an earthquake. Fires or explosions due to gas line breaks can be more damaging than the actual earthquake itself. Gas supply companies recommend that the gas supply be cut off immediately if there is a smell of gas after an earthquake; if nobody is in place to do this, an unattended earthquake valve will instantly cut off the gas. Types of valve Two types of valve are commonly employed: one is sensitive to motion and the other to excessive gas flow. One of each type can be connected sequentially for maximum reliability. = Motion sensing caged ball= A metal ball is retained away from an orifice by sitting upon a ring. Any shaking of the mechanism will cause the ball to roll off its ledge and fall down to block the orifice. It is reset using either an external magnetic device or an internal lift mechanism. If it is too sensitive, it may be triggered by normal vibrations such as passing vehicles. After a severe seismic event, gas piping may be damaged, requiring complete re-inspection for breaks or leaks. =Excessive flow sensor= A valve is closed when the flow exceeds a certain limit that is appropriate to the application. This will only operate when a pipe is broken and there is significant leakage. It may not operate in case of a small, though still dangerous, leak.

History Established in 1972, Maybeck High School is named after the regional architect Bernard Maybeck (1862‚Äì1957). Bernard Maybeck's concern for the environment and his appreciation for disciplined technique inspired his use of local natural materials and craftsmanship within the existing landscape. In his honor, Maybeck High School promotes traditional academic study as well as the exploration and appreciation of nature. Admissions Prospective students typically attend an Open House, visit classes, take a placement test, and then interview with Maybeck staff prior to admittance. Curriculum Maybeck offers an academically challenging college-preparatory curriculum in a collaborative rather than competitive environment. Maybeck students find creative, intelligent peers who are excited about learning. Extracurricular Activities Student extracurricular activities vary widely, typically with a strong emphasis on the outdoors, culture, and the arts, encompassing film and theatre production, biking and hiking trips, and outings to local museums and events. Teachers encourage and support student-led clubs, and the Student Activities Committee organizes creative extracurricular opportunities. Special Programs Baja Special Program, 2006 For two weeks before spring break, the school suspends regular classes and conducts Special Programs, in which students divide into small groups led by staff members, each pursuing its own activity. One group may go snowboarding in Tahoe or diving in the Philippines, while another group paints murals in the halls of the school or builds kites to fly at the Berkeley Marina. Programs vary from year to year; past offerings include trips to New Orleans, Machu Picchu, France, Egypt, and Vietnam, and seminars on subjects such as fencing, South Indian culture, and Broadway theater.

Life  A native of Polotsk, Symeon studied at the Kiev Ecclesiastical Academy and probably continued on to the Jesuit college of Wilno: the influence of Jesuit theology and school dramas was very pronounced in his mature work. He became a Greek-Catholic monk (he described himself as \\"Simeonis Piotrowskj Sitnianowicz hieromonachi Polocens.[is] Ord.[inis] S.[ancti] Bas.[ilii] M.[agni] \\"Margarita Korzo, –í–Ω–µ—à–Ω—è—è —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏—è –∫–∞–∫ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫ –≤–¥–æ—Ö–Ω–æ–≤–µ–Ω–∏—è. –ö –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—É –æ–± –∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ –∫–∏–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏ –º–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–æ–≤ XVII –≤. –î–≤–∞ –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä–∞, Studi Slavistici VI (2009), s. 59-84–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –≥–ª–∞–∑–∞–º–∏ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –∫–Ω–∏–≥–∏ ) in 1656. His name became known later that year, when he presented to Tsar Alexis, then visiting his native Polotsk during the war, several panegyrics in verse. The monarch was pleased to discover what looked like propaganda of the Third Rome doctrine in the modern Western style that would appeal to Ruthenian and Polish intellectuals alike. Symeon was recognized as an invaluable asset to Moscow's campaign to cast the Tsar as a champion of Eastern Rite in the region. The Tsar invited Symeon to relocate to Moscow, where at the request of Tsar Alexis he opened the first school aimed at educating Russian clerks in Latin, then the language of diplomacy in 1664. By 1668, the school no longer was in operation.:ru:–°–∏–º–µ–æ–Ω –ü–æ–ª–æ—Ü–∫–∏–π Apart from Latin, Symeon was the first to teach grammar, poetics, and rhetoric to the Russians. He revived the long-forgotten art of preaching, and his sermons proved quite popular with the Muscovite courtiers, such as Fyodor Rtishchev and Bogdan Khitrovo. His erudition made him famous in other Orthodox countries. At the request of the Oriental patriarchs, he delivered an address urging the promotion of Greek learning in the country. A statue of Symeon was created in 2003 by Alexandr Finsky and resides in Polatsk, Belarus. His role in the Synod of 1666 Unsurprisingly, given his background, Symeon of Polotsk took a profound stand against clerical and literary conservatives, or the Old Believers. As the Great Schism of the Russian Orthodox Church was developing, he was called upon to elaborate refutation of their tenets. It was he who drafted decisions of the church council that deposed Patriarch Nikon and anathemized his opponents. This was known as the Great Moscow Synod. In recognition of his wisdom and erudition, Symeon was charged with the task of educating the Tsar's children: the heir Alexei Alexeyevich until his death, then the future Fyodor III, Regent Sophia, and Peter I. In 1679 he prepared the decree to establish the Slavic Greek Latin Academy but before it opened, he died at the age of 50.http://www.hrono.ru/biograf/simeon.html He was buried in the Zaikonospassky Monastery, where the Academy would be opened two years later.  Works  From the standpoint of literary history, Symeon Polotsky marks a watershed in the Russian literature. He is frequently cited as the first poet in the language, although the bulk of his work is either in Church Slavonic or Polish. As a poet, he clung to the principles of syllabic Polish versification which he learned as a youth. By adopting syllabic verse, he is said to have stultified Russian verse for over a century.Raffel, Burton. Russian Poetry Under the Tsars. SUNY Press, 1971. . Page xvi. > His poetry is primarily panegyric and didactic, and either celebrates some > important court and political event or exposes some shortcoming of > contemporary life. Polotsky tried to bring to the Russians the pattern and > motives of Western‚Äîbetter to say, Polish‚Äîliterature. His language is heavy > and cumbersome but his choice of new topics and rather skillful command of > syllabic versification won him the admiration of the tsar and the > court...Serge A. Zenkovsky (ed.), Medieval Russia's Epics, Chronicles, and > Tales, 2nd ed. (Penguin, 1974), p. 517. During his years in Moscow, Symeon continued to develop an imperial style of panegyrical verse, rife with protracted tirades, which were enlivened by occasional allusions to classical mythology. \\"With Simeon, a whole museum of ancient gods, muses, heroes, authors, and philosophers entered Russian literature\\".The Cambridge History of Russian Literature (ed. by Charles Moser). Cambridge University Press, 1992. . Page 34. His extensive collection of poetry, The Garden of Many Flowers, was not printed in his lifetime, but he did publish a verse translation of the Psalter, which was set to music within several years after his death, which took place Moscow. As a theologian, Symeon frequently quoted the Vulgate, St. Jerome, St. Augustine, and other Latin authorities, which was perceived by his detractors as a deliberate attempt to westernize Orthodox religious thought. In fact, his faithful disciple Sylvester Medvedev was later condemned for having succumbed to Catholicism. Symeon was also a dramatist; the comedy Action of the Prodigal Son and the tragedy On Nebuchadnezzar the King rank among the first dramatic works in the Russian language.

They have one of the highest energy densities of all batteries, but they are not widely used because of problems with high anode cost and byproduct removal when using traditional electrolytes. This has restricted their use to mainly military applications. However, an electric vehicle with aluminium batteries has the potential for up to eight times the range of a lithium-ion battery with a significantly lower total weight. Aluminium‚Äìair batteries are primary cells, i.e., non- rechargeable. Once the aluminium anode is consumed by its reaction with atmospheric oxygen at a cathode immersed in a water-based electrolyte to form hydrated aluminium oxide, the battery will no longer produce electricity. However, it is possible to mechanically recharge the battery with new aluminium anodes made from recycling the hydrated aluminium oxide. Such recycling would be essential if aluminium‚Äìair batteries were to be widely adopted. Aluminium-powered vehicles have been under discussion for some decades. Hybridisation mitigates the costs, and in 1989 road tests of a hybridised aluminium‚Äìair/lead‚Äìacid battery in an electric vehicle were reported. An aluminium-powered plug-in hybrid minivan was demonstrated in Ontario in 1990.Plug-in highway . In March 2013, Phinergy released a video demonstration of an electric car using aluminium‚Äìair cells driven 330 km using a special cathode and potassium hydroxide. On May 27, 2013, the Israeli channel 10 evening news broadcast showed a car with Phinergy battery in the back, claiming range before replacement of the aluminum anodes is necessary.  Electrochemistry  The anode oxidation half-reaction is Al + ‚Üí + 3e‚àí -2.31 V. The cathode reduction half-reaction is + + 4e‚àí ‚Üí +0.40 V. The total reaction is 4Al + + ‚Üí + 2.71 V. About 1.2 volts potential difference is created by these reactions and is achievable in practice when potassium hydroxide is used as the electrolyte. Saltwater electrolyte achieves approximately 0.7 volts per cell. The specific voltage of the cell can vary in dependence of the composition of the electrolyte as well as the structure and materials of the cathode.  Commercialization  = Issues = Aluminium as a \\"fuel\\" for vehicles has been studied by Yang and Knickle. In 2002, they concluded: Technical problems remain to be solved to make Al‚Äìair batteries suitable for electric vehicles. Anodes made of pure aluminium are corroded by the electrolyte, so the aluminium is usually alloyed with tin or other elements. The hydrated alumina that is created by the cell reaction forms a gel-like substance at the anode and reduces the electricity output. This is an issue being addressed in the development work on Al‚Äìair cells. For example, additives that form the alumina as a powder rather than a gel have been developed. Modern air cathodes consist of a reactive layer of carbon with a nickel-grid current collector, a catalyst (e.g., cobalt), and a porous hydrophobic PTFE film that prevents electrolyte leakage. The oxygen in the air passes through the PTFE then reacts with the water to create hydroxide ions. These cathodes work well but they can be expensive. Traditional Al‚Äìair batteries had a limited shelf lifeAluminium/air batteries because the aluminium reacted with the electrolyte and produced hydrogen when the battery was not in use‚Äìalthough this is no longer the case with modern designs. The problem can be avoided by storing the electrolyte in a tank outside the battery and transferring it to the battery when it is required for use. These batteries can be used, for example, as reserve batteries in telephone exchanges and as backup power sources. Aluminium‚Äìair batteries may become an effective solution for marine applications for their high energy density, low cost and the abundance of Aluminum, with no emissions at the point of use (boats and ships). Phinergy Marine, RiAlAiR and several other commercial companies are working on commercial and military application in the marine environment.

Its area is , and its resident population was 34,756 in 2009. It is located along the West bank of the Naryn River, opposite the main Osh - Bishkek road. Located at the edge of the Tien Shan Mountains, when heading South from Bishkek, Tashk√∂m√ºr is the gateway to the Fergana valley. History Officially founded on December 17, 1943, Tashk√∂m√ºr, meaning stone-coal, grew into one of the largest industrial centers of the Central Asian region of the Soviet Union. It was primarily a mining town, but had a cigarette factory and other industries as well, which complemented the output of the coal mines. A railroad was constructed, and trains transported the coal out of Tashk√∂m√ºr to all corners of the Soviet Union. At its peak, Tashk√∂m√ºr had a population of around 35,000. Dams constructed along the Naryn river transformed what used to be a stream into a sizable river. Residents will also attest to a change in climate, which they attribute to the dams. Furthermore, the Tashk√∂m√ºr dam and the Shamaldysay dam raised the water level considerably, causing certain settlements to be submerged by the water. Despite the presence of the dams and hydroelectric plants, Tashk√∂m√ºr still does not have 100% reliable electricity. The Land and The People Tashk√∂m√ºr is located in what could be described as a canyon, which the Naryn river runs through. Fossils of dinosaurs and dinosaur eggs have been discovered in the area, and paleontologists have speculated that once the area was used by dinosaurs to lay their eggs. The mountains surrounding the town are rich in minerals, not only in coal, which gave Tashk√∂m√ºr its fame. The town spans about north to south, but is less than a kilometer (0.6 miles) across. There is no arable land in Tashk√∂m√ºr, although just a few kilometers south the Fergana Valley begins, and the cotton plantations are ubiquitous, alongside the melons and other crops. Tashk√∂m√ºr is divided into five neighborhoods: Severniy (the North), Bayetova, the Center, Dostuk, and the Mikrorayon. Each neighborhood has its own school, except for the center, where there are 3 schools. The town of Tashk√∂m√ºr also oversees two towns (Kyzyl-Jar and Shamaldy-Say) and five villages: Kyzyl-Alma, Tendik, Chuyut-Say, Kuduk-Say and Kashkulak-Say. Shamaldysay, the largest of these places, has three schools (#2, #8, and #10) while the other three villages have only one school each (#11, #6, and #9 respectively). At the time of its foundation, the population of Tashk√∂m√ºr was mostly Russian and ethnically non- Kyrgyz. There was no grazable land, so the Kyrgyz had never settled there. After coal was discovered, Kyrgyz families began to move into town. Until Kyrgyzstan's independence in 1991 the Kyrgyz were not the overwhelming majority. However, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, many Russians and residents of other nationalities began to leave. This was particularly the case until 1995, when the biggest economic problems affected the town, which continue to this day (2006). Now the Kyrgyz population makes up over 90% of the population. Although only about from the Uzbek border, Tashk√∂m√ºr does not have a large Uzbek population (less than 50 families). The total population of Tashk√∂m√ºr is estimated to be between 20‚Äì25,000, however the continuous emigration of its residents makes it hard to know exactly. The Local Economy Ever since the mine was shut down and the factories closed, the town has been struggling to survive. The answer, for many, has been to emigrate to Russia, Kazakhstan, or simply to the capital, Bishkek. Most families claim at least one member working abroad to make ends meet. The men usually work construction jobs, while the women find jobs as saleswomen at the bazaars or stores. These migrant workers are usually seasonal: they leave in the early spring and return in the fall, since the cold in the North makes for hard working conditions. The remittances have allowed Tashk√∂m√ºr residents to retain a decent standard of living. In recent years, many have used the money to renovate their homes, to buy DVD players and satellite dishes, or to open stores, and try to start a business. As Uzbekistan has made it more difficult and expensive for goods to be exported south into, and through Uzbekistan, Tashk√∂m√ºr's major opening to the outside world has been severed and in turn, its ability to export any goods it might manufacture has dropped. While during the Soviet era all apartment buildings had gas and working plumbing, this is no longer the case. Water delivery, especially to the homes on the edge of town, is not reliable. There is no hot water. In 2006 cell phones finally reached Tashk√∂m√ºr, which had been one of the last towns in the country left without them. There is still no public internet access.

Most of their service was during the Apache Wars, between 1849 and 1886, though the last scout retired in 1947. The Apache scouts were the eyes and ears of the United States military and sometimes the cultural translators for the various Apache bands and the Americans. Apache scouts also served in the Navajo War, the Yavapai War, the Mexican Border War and they saw stateside duty during World War II. There has been a great deal written about Apache scouts, both as part of United States Army reports from the field and more colorful accounts written after the events by non-Apaches in newspapers and books. Men such as Al Sieber and Tom Horn were sometimes the commanding officers of small groups of Apache Scouts. As was the custom in the United States military, scouts were generally enlisted with Anglo nicknames or single names. Many Apache Scouts received citations for bravery. Apache Scouts by band The Apache people have been lumped together under the name \\"Apache\\" by outsiders. In reality, they are a group of culturally related Native American tribes in the Southwestern United States, which include the Chiricahua, Jicarilla, Lipan, Mescalero, Salinero, Plains and Western Apache. Distant cousins of the Apache are the Navajo, with which they share the Southern Athabaskan languages. Historically, they have defined themselves by geographical areas, clan and kinship ties with neighboring groups. Following this pattern, Apache Souts were usually grouped in operational units by band. Tonto Apache scouts were recruited to assist General Crook find Chief Delshay's band who fled the Fort Verde reservation. Crook's Chief of Scouts, Albert Sieber always seemed to have his Tonto scouts with him through the Apache Wars. White Mountain Apache scouts served with Company B under Lieutenant Charles B. Gatewood from Fort Apache in 1885 to 1886. General George Crook had high praise for this group which is composed of several bands. \\"Chiricahuas were the most subordinate, energetic, untiring and, by odds, the most efficient of their command.\\" These scouts were sent to Florida by General Miles, along with those who they tracked for sixteen months in 1885 and 1886, as if these Apache scouts were hostiles to be punished. They were kept captive under nominal arrest as prisoners of war, along with the rest of Geronimo's band whom they'd helped the army track down, for twenty-six years before finally being released. Warm Springs Apache scouts served in Company B under Lieutenant Britton Davis and were in the field tracking Geronimo and Nana. In 1885 Mescalero scouts were with Major Vanm Horn cavalry which was trying to prevent Geronimo, Nana and others from crossing the Rio Grande near Fort Stanton. Service history ApacheIndianScouts, Ft. Huachuca, AZ, Capt. B.M. Irwin, Last Command Officer =Navajo War= Mescalero Apache scouts served with the army during the Navajo War in 1863 and 1864. One of the last battles of the war involving the scouts occurred along the Pecos River of New Mexico Territory on January 4, 1864. After a band of about 100 Navajo warriors raided the reservation at Bosque Redondo, the local Indian agent led sixty Mescaleros south in the pursuit of the raiders and eventually caught up with them at the Pecos. When the fighting started, the Navajo realized they couldn't escape with their herd of stolen livestock so they took up defensive positions to try to fight off their pursuers. Initially, the Navajo were successful in keeping their enemies back, but, eventually, United States Army reinforcements began to arrive. After a long battle the Navajo were forced to retreat without the livestock, leaving an estimated forty dead on the field. Another twenty-five Navajos were estimated to have been wounded and a group the same size escaped. There were no casualties among the Americans or the Apache scouts and they recovered fifty horses and mules. Less than two weeks later Colonel Kit Carson would lead an expedition into Canyon de Chelly, the heart of Navajo territory, capturing most of the inhabitants and ending the war. =Yavapai War= Warm Springs Apache scouts in the 1870s. Apache scouts were employed by the United States Army throughout most of the Apache Wars but it wasn't until about 1870 when General George Crook introduced the idea of enlisting entire companies of scouts. However, at that time, few Apaches were willing to join Crook so he was forced to recruit native Americans from various tribes across the Southwest. The majority of Crook's scouts were Apache, divided into two companies, but at first there were also Navajos, Pimas, Yaquis, Opatas, Papagos, Walapais, Yavapais, and Paiutes, as well as some Mexicans and Americans. General Crook allowed any captured Apache male to join his scouts, believing that \\"the wilder the Apache was, the more he was likely to know the wiles and statagems of those still out in the mountains. (sic)\\" While Crook was recruiting natives to fight for him, he was also fighting against the Western Apaches and the closely associated Yavapai tribe in central Arizona Territory. During the Tonto Basin Campaign in 1872, Crook deployed his scouts at the Battle of Salt River Canyon on December 28. Over 100 Yavapai and Tonto men, women and children were held up inside a cave overlooking the Salt River. With some 130 cavalrymen, and about thirty scouts, Crook attacked the cave, killing seventy-six people, including non combatants, and capturing the remaining thirty-four. The general followed up the victory with another at Turret Peak, on March 27, 1873, in which another fifty-seven Yavapai and Tonto Apache were killed. Only one man was killed on the Americans' side during both engagements and soon after the Yavapai and the Tonto began flocking to Camp Verde to surrender. General Crook with White Mountain Apache Scout William Alchesay on the right, and an unknown Apache scout on the left. Small bands of Yavapai and Apache raiders continued to harass the army and the settlers in and around Tonto Basin for two more years. After the war ended, General Crook departed Arizona for Dakota Territory in 1876. Colonel Augustus P. Kautz took over the command of the scouts and he formed a third company in early 1877 and a fourth in 1878. Upon taking command of the scouts, Kautz wrote; \\"These scouts supported by a small force of cavalry, are exceedingly efficient, and have succeeded, with one or two exceptions, in finding every party of Indians they have gone in pursuit of. They are a great terror to the runaways [renegades] from the Reservations, and for such work are more efficient than double the number of soldiers. (sic)\\" =Border War= Apache scouts at Fort Apache in 1919. (Left to right) First Sergeant Chicken, Jesse Palmer, Tea Square, Sergeant Big Chow, and Corporal C.F. Josh. Following Geronimo's surrender in 1886, there was little need for Apache scouts so their ranks were thinned down to just fifty men by 1891. In 1915 there were only twenty-four left. However, after Pancho Villa's attack on Columbus, New Mexico, in March 1916, General John J. Pershing was ordered to command a punitive expedition into Mexico to capture or kill Villa. Pershing authorized the enlistment of seventeen new Apache scouts, resulting in thirty-nine men. Pancho Villa and his rebels were operating in Chihuahua when Pershing led his army across the international border. The scouts were divided into two groups. The first group headed into Mexico from Fort Huachuca, Arizona, to join up with the 10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers, while the second group departed from Fort Apache, to join the 11th Cavalry. However, by the time the scouts arrived in Chihuahua, Mexico, the hunt for Villa was already suspended by Pershing, due to the defeat in the Battle of Carrizal, in which the Americans engaged Mexican government troops, known as Carrancistas. The hunt was never continued and after that Pershing began an occupation of northern Chihuahua, followed by a slow withdrawal back to the United States, under President Wilson's orders. The first battle involving the scouts was fought at Ojo Azules Ranch. On May 5, a small group of scouts joined up with a troop from the 11th Cavalry to attack about 150 Villistas. In all sixty-one Mexicans were killed and another seventy were captured, all without sustaining any casualties. After the expedition ended in February 1917 the army disbanded about half of the force, leaving twenty-two scouts for duty. Their war-time service was not completely over though. Conflict between the United States and Mexican armies continued until 1919 and Mexican raids across the border were a frequent occurrence into the 1920s.

History In 1937, University of the Pacific's President Knoles envisioned the chapel which has become a Stockton landmark. Percy and Lillie Morris, having borne the majority of the financial burden of construction, were memorialized when the chapel was officially named and dedicated on April 19, 1942. In 1946, Ovid Ritter, Vice President of the university, wrote, ‚ÄúThe College of the Pacific serves students of all faiths, and Morris Chapel renders service to them all without distinction at all times.‚Äù Faith The Chapel was conceived as a spiritual ‚Äòlighthouse‚Äô for the University of the Pacific. It serves as the focal point for Christian worship on campus, both Protestant and Roman Catholic and it has also provided over the years a venue for the celebration of marriage for thousands of couples, both within and beyond the University community. Features =The Sanctuary Window= The great Sanctuary Window above and behind the altar originally consisted of three lancet windows, tall and narrow, which were installed in the Temple Methodist Church in San Francisco in 1930. These windows were removed when the church gave up its building in 1937. The windows were then on exhibition in 1939-1940, after which they were presented to Morris Chapel by the trustees of the Temple Methodist Church. The three separate windows were then merged into one large window consisting of the three great panels, and were installed for the \\"enrichment of our sanctuary and to the glory of God\\".Student Life - University of the Pacific The three principal figures from left to right represent Faith, Love (John 4:8; Jesus with the children), and Hope. =The Rose Window= At the opposite end of the Chapel over the gallery is the Rose Window, also a gift of Temple Methodist. It expresses symbolically the Life of Christ. Beginning with the lowest rosette, the descending dove symbolizes the Holy Spirit hovering over Mary the mother of Jesus at the moment of her conception. Moving clockwise, the five-pointed Star of Bethlehem recalls the Epiphany of Jesus to the wise men from the East, and subsequently to all nations beyond Israel. The next rosette portrays the figures of an open book, the Bible, the Word of God, which Jesus is and which he preached. At the top, the figure of the sun encircling the Greek abbreviation for Jesus‚Äô name (IHC) recalls his title as the Sun of Righteousness. To the right, the chalice recalls his last Passover meal with his disciples, and the sacrament of the Eucharist that he instituted there. In the last rosette, the crown of thorns symbolizes his passion, and the abbreviation, INRI, recalls the legend that Pilate commanded to be placed over his head on the cross: Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorim, Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. The central rosette of the Cross and the Crown recalls the Kingdom of God, which Christians believe was announced and initiated in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. =The Chancel Organ= The original organ was contributed by Samuel H. Kress of New York. The present organ, dedicated on April 2, 1992, is a two-manual tracker organ with 1,300 speaking pipes, custom-built by J. W. Walker & Sons, Ltd., of Suffolk, England. Its purchase, installation, and maintenance have been made possible through the generous gifts of alumni and friends of the University. =The Inscriptions= A remarkable feature of Morris Chapel is the inscription of the Apostles' Creed, written in Latin above the side arches in the nave. The Apostles' Creed is one of the earliest known professions of Christian faith, and was used as a baptismal confession in Rome as early as the second century of the Common Era. Over the chancel arch is inscribed the Kyrie (Kyrie eleison..., Christe eleison..., Kyrie eleison...; Lord have mercy..., Christ have mercy..., Lord have mercy...), another of the most ancient liturgical elements of Christian worship, used perhaps even by the very first Christian communities. The liturgical elements of the ancient church, combined with the majestic architecture of the medieval church lend contemporary worship a palpable solidarity with the communion of saints, all those who have given their lives to Christ throughout the ages.

The actual title used by Nerio (Latin: Nerius) was dominus Athenarum et Thebarum or dominus Stives et Sithines, both meaning \\"lord of Athens [Sethines] and Thebes [Stives].\\" on two separate occasions from 1435 to 1439 and again from 1441 to 1451. He was a member of the Acciaioli family of Florence, the son of Francesco Lord of Sykaminon, who was cousin to Antonio I Acciaioli Duke of Athens. His mother was Margareta Malpigli. Nerio II's rule was contemporaneous with a renewed Italian philhellenism and corresponding interest in antiquities and the Greek language. Nerio not only spoke Greek naturally, but also owned the most famous monuments of the Hellenic world in his capital of Athens. Nerio arrived in Greece in 1419 on the death of his father when he was only three years old. He was named heir to his uncle Antonio I of Athens, but on his uncle's death in 1435, he had to fight his uncle's widow Maria Melissene and the Chalkokondyles for the ducal throne. While George Chalkokondyles, the father of the Laonikos Chalkokondyles was pressing her suit before Murad II, the Ottoman sultan, the leading men of Athens tricked Maria into leaving the Acropolis then handed the title to Nerio. Maria and George Chalkokondyles' family were banished from Athens.Chalkokondyles, 6.50; translated by Anthony Kaldellis, The Histories (Cambridge: Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library, 2014), vol. 2 pp. 67-9 After securing his position with Turkish help, he was removed by the intrigues of his brother Antonio II and driven from the Acropolis.An act celebrated by Florentine poet Jacopo Gaddi in a short verse De Nerio II et Antonio II Acciaiolis fratribus ducibus Athenarum which puts an interesting classical twist on the rivalry between the two brothers: :Nobile par fratrum, Graecos Dux rexit uterque ::Non simul, alterno tempore sceptra ferens. :Gesserat haec Nerius, quo pulso Antonius ardens ::Rursus at extincto fratre gerit Nerius. :Nimium Pollux et Castor in urbe fuissent, ::Si fratrum illis gratia sanctus amor. His inveterate personal enemy, the historian Laonikos Chalkokondyles, denigrates him as \\"effeminate.\\"Chalkokondyles, 6.52; translated by Kaldellis, The Histories, pp. 69-71 Nerio returned to power in 1441 on the death of his brother, after spending a few years in Florence. He immediately expelled his brother's widow Maria Zorzi. It is probably that Nerio was present when the Emperor John VIII made a proclamation of Catholicism in the Florentine Duomo on 6 July 1439. In 1444, Nerio went to war against the Turks on the side of the despot Constantine, but came to terms with the Ottomans. He subsequently lost Thebes to Constantine and was forced to pay him tribute and become his vassal. In 1446, Murad assisted Nerio in retaking Thebes for the Latins. On his death, he was succeeded by his young son Francesco under the regency of his widow Chiara Zorzi.

When representing terrain, the vertical dimension is usually exaggerated by a factor between five and ten; this facilitates the visual recognition of terrain features  History  If the account of Sima Qian (c. 145‚Äì86 BCE) in his Records of the Grand Historian is proven correct upon the unearthing of Qin Shi Huang's tomb, the raised- relief map has existed since the Qin dynasty (221‚Äì206 BCE) of China. Joseph Needham suggests that certain pottery vessels of the Han dynasty (202 BCE ‚Äì 220 CE) showing artificial mountains as lid decorations may have influenced the raised-relief map.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 580‚Äì581. The Han dynasty general Ma Yuan made a raised-relief map of valleys and mountains in a rice- constructed model of 32 CE.Crespigny (2007), 659. Such rice models were expounded on by the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) author Jiang Fang in his Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains with Rice (c. 845). A raised-relief map made of wood representing all the provinces of the empire and put together like a giant () jigsaw puzzle was invented by Xie Zhuang (421‚Äì466) during the Liu Song dynasty (420‚Äì479). Shen Kuo (1031-1095) created a raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, beeswax, and wheat paste.Sivin (1995), III, 22.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 579‚Äì580. His wooden model pleased Emperor Shenzong of Song, who later ordered that all the prefects administering the frontier regions should prepare similar wooden maps which could be sent to the capital and stored in an archive.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 580. In 1130, Huang Shang made a wooden raised-relief map which later caught the attention of the Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi, who tried to acquire it but instead made his own map out of sticky clay and wood. The map, made of eight pieces of wood connected by hinges, could be folded up and carried around by one person. Later, Ibn Battuta (1304‚Äì1377) described a raised-relief map while visiting GibraltarNeedham (1986), Volume 3, 579 In his 1665 paper for the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, John Evelyn (1620‚Äì1706) believed that wax models imitating nature and bas relief maps were something entirely new from France.Needham (1986), Volume 3, 579. Some later scholars attributed the first raised-relief map to one Paul Dox, who represented the area of Kufstein in his raised-relief map of 1510. Construction There are a number of ways to create a raised-relief map. Each method has advantages and disadvantages in regards to accuracy, price, and relative ease of creation. =Layer Stacking= Starting with a topographic map, one can cut out successive layers from some sheet material, with edges following the contour lines on the map. These may be assembled in a stack to obtain a rough approximation of the terrain. This method is commonly used as the base for architectural models, and is usually done without vertical exaggeration. For models of landforms, the stack can then be smoothed by filling with some material. This model may be used directly, or for greater durability a mold may be made from it. This mold may then be used to produce a plaster model. =Vacuum Formed Plastic Maps= A combination of computer numerical control (CNC) machining a master model, and vacuum forming copies from this, can be been used to rapidly mass- produce raised-relief maps. The Vacuum Forming technique, invented in 1947 by the Army Map Service in Washington, D.C., uses vacuum-formed plastic sheets and heat to increase the production rate of these maps. To make the Vacuum- Formed plastic maps, first a master model made of resin or other materials is created with a computer guided milling machine using a digital terrain model. Then a reproduction mold is cast using the master mold and a heat and pressure resistant material. Fine holes are put into the reproduction mold so that the air can later be removed by a vacuum. Next, a plastic sheet is applied to the mold so that they are airtight, and a heater is placed above the plastic for about 10 seconds. The vacuum is then applied to remove the remaining air. After letting the plastic cool, it can be removed and the terrain is complete. After this step, a color map can be overlaid/printed onto the bases that were created to make it realistic. Vacuum-formed plastic maps have many advantages and disadvantages. They can be quickly produced, which can be beneficial in time of war or disaster. However, the accuracy of certain points throughout the model can vary. The points that touch the mold first are the most accurate, while the points that touch the mold last can become bulged and slightly distorted. Also, the effectiveness of this particular construction method varies by the terrain being represented. They are not good at representing sharp-edged land forms like high mountain ranges or urban areas. =3D Printing= STL model of Mars with 20√ó elevation exaggeration for 3D printing Another method which is becoming more widespread is the use of 3D printing. With the rapid development of this technology its use is becoming increasingly economic. In order to create a raised-relief map using a 3D printer, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) are rendered into a 3D computer model, which can then be sent to a 3D printer. Most consumer-level 3D printers extrude plastic layer by layer to create a 3D object. However, if a map is needed for commercial and professional uses, higher-end printers can be used. These 3D printers use a combination of powders, resins, and even metals to create higher-quality models. After the model is created, color can be added to show different land cover characteristics, providing a more realistic view of the area. Some benefits of using a 3D printed model include the technology and DEMs being more prevalent easier to find, and that they are easier to understand than a typical topographic map. = DEM/TIN Formed Papercraft Maps = Creating a papercraft raised relief map via a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a low cost alternative to many other methods. The method involves converting the DEM to a triangulated irregular network (TIN), unfolding the TIN, printing the unfolded TIN on paper, and assembling the printout into a physical 3D model. This method allows raised relief maps to be constructed without the need for specialized equipment or extensive training. The degree of realism and accuracy of the resulting maps is similar to that of layer stacking models. However, the quality of the final map heavily depends on the characteristics of the TIN used. Non-terrain applications For appropriate mathematical functions and especially for certain types of statistics displays, a similar model may be constructed as an aid to understanding a function or as an aid to studying the statistical data. Notable examples The Great Polish Map of Scotland is claimed to be the largest terrain relief model, constructed out of brick and concrete in the grounds of a hotel near Peebles, Scotland. It measures . However, a site in Ningxia province, China at was spotted in 2006 using satellite imagery. It measured , had a perimeter and appeared to be a large scale relief model (1:500) of Aksai Chin, a disputed territory between China and India.

However, in The True Glory, instead of just an American G.I. and a British Tommy, the voices include a Canadian, a French resister, a Parisian civilian family, an African-American tank gunner, and several female perspectives including a nurse, and clerical staff. The film is introduced by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe. Prominent commentators include General George S. Patton; Best Actor Tony nominee and American Theatre Hall of Fame and Grammy Hall of Fame Broadway and film star Sam Levene; two-time Academy Award-winning film actor and director, Peter Ustinov, three-time Academy Award-winning playwright Paddy Chayefsky.

In the video, made in the wake of the passage of a controversial state bill which would have effectively frozen the salaries of state employees, Duffy was asked about whether he would be willing to cut his own $174,000 salary. Duffy responded that he would only be willing to do so as part of a general round of salary cuts for government employees, and insisted that he was \\"struggling\\" to get by, despite his salary being nearly three times the average for Wisconsin residents.Stewart, Rebecca. \\"'Real World' congressman's money troubles\\", CNN, March 30, 2011.Gilbert, Craig. \\"House freshman Duffy tells constituents \\"he's not living high on the hog\\" on congressional pay\\", Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, March 29, 2011.Downie, James. \\"How to Prolong a Scandal, Wisconsin Edition\\", The New Republic, March 31, 2011.Bivins, Larry. \\"Dems mock Sean Duffy's $174,000 salary 'struggles'\\", Wausau Daily Herald, March 31, 2011.

He stated that \\"President Trump is fulfilling a campaign promise to re-evaluate our visa vetting process so that the American people are safe from terrorism.\\" In January 2017, Duffy co- sponsored legislation that would end protection for grey wolves in the Endangered Species Act. On 12/06/2018, Duffy's legislation (H.R. 5784) to rename a Post Office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin was passed into law. In July 2018, Duffy said that Europe, China, Canada and Mexico had committed \\"economic terrorism in a way\\" by placing retaliatory tariffs on the United States in response to tariffs enacted by the Trump administration.

It proposed replacing the director of the consumer watchdog group, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), with a five-person commission and removing the CFPB from Federal Reserve System oversight so that it \\"would go through the same funding process as other federal agencies.\\" The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would have been renamed the Financial Product Safety Commission.

The bill would create a short-term independent board to oversee Puerto Rico's financial planning and annual budgets, with the aim of restoring financial stability to Puerto Rico and avoiding American taxpayer liability. It is similar to bills written in July and October 2015 by Pedro Pierluisi, the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, in that the Duffy bill also proposes a financial oversight board and access to Chapter 9 restructuring. The October 2015 Pierluisi bill was neglected in the U.S. Congress until the governor of Puerto Rico visited Washington on December 9, 2015, to draw attention to the crisis and the bill. \\"By the afternoon, Republicans in Congress had introduced two bills to help alleviate Puerto Rico's fiscal problems\\", one of which was the Duffy bill. In April 2016 the bill stalled in the House for rewriting. The American Conservative Union gave him a 78% evaluation in 2017 and Americans for Prosperity gave him an 88% evaluation in 2019. Committee assignments Duffy served on the House Committee on Financial Services. He was appointed Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations in November 2014, taking over from Patrick McHenry. He was also a member of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. He also served on the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit and the Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity.  Controversy  In February 2017, Duffy made controversial statements in an interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota, claiming that \\"[t]here is a difference\\" between terror acts committed by white people and those committed by Muslims. When Camerota, referring to the Quebec City mosque shooting, asked why President didn't talk about \\"the white terrorists who mowed down six Muslims praying at their mosque,\\" Duffy answered \\"I don't know, there's a difference. You don't have a group like ISIS or al Qaeda that is inspiring people around the world to take up arms and kill innocents. ... That was a one off, Alisyn.\\" When Camerota mentioned the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, Duffy said the incidents didn't compare: \\"So you give me two examples, right. If you want to compare this one person in the last 10 years that you can give an example ... Oklahoma City bombing was 20 years ago.\\" Duffy was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership. =Electoral history= * 2018 race for U.S. House of Representatives ‚Äì 7th District ** Sean Duffy (R), 60.2% ** Margaret Engebretson (D), 38.5% * 2016 race for U.S. House of Representatives ‚Äì 7th DistrictDecision 2016: Wisconsin Results, NBC News ** Sean Duffy (R), 62% ** Mary Hoeft (D), 38% * 2014 race for U.S. House of Representatives ‚Äì 7th District ** Sean Duffy (R), 60% ** Kelly Westlund (D), 39% * 2012 race for U.S. House of Representatives ‚Äì 7th District ** Sean Duffy (R), 56% ** Pat Kreitlow (D), 44% * 2010 race for U.S. House of Representatives ‚Äì 7th District ** Sean Duffy (R), 52% ** Julie Lassa (D), 44% * 2008 race for District Attorney of Ashland County, Wisconsin ** Sean Duffy (R) (inc.) ** unopposed * 2006 race for District Attorney of Ashland County, Wisconsin ** Sean Duffy (R) (inc.) ** unopposed * 2004 race for District Attorney of Ashland County, Wisconsin ** Sean Duffy (R) (inc.) ** unopposed * 2002 race for District Attorney of Ashland County, Wisconsin ** Sean Duffy (R) (inc.) ** unopposed Personal life Duffy is married to Rachel Campos-Duffy, a fellow alumna of The Real World and later Fox News personality.Campos-Duffy, Rachel. \\"I'm Expecting My 5th: What To Make Of The Trend In Bigger Families\\", Parent Dish, December 19, 2007.

It was the last of two OMD albums produced by American record producer Stephen Hague. \\"(Forever) Live and Die\\" became the band's third hit single in the US and returned the band to the top 20 in the UK, peaking at No. 11. The album received generally unfavourable reviews and is held in low esteem by frontman Andy McCluskey. Album information For the first time, brothers Graham and Neil Weir were formally credited as full members of OMD for this album. They had been involved with the band as session musicians since the re-recording of \\"Julia's Song\\" in 1984 as a \\"Talking Loud and Clear\\" single B-side, and were credited as \\"also playing\\" musicians on the 1985 album Crush. The single \\"(Forever) Live and Die\\" was written by the Weir brothers with Paul Humphreys. Owing to label-enforced time constraints, the first nine songs written for The Pacific Age appeared on the album. The songs \\"Cajun Moon\\" and \\"Cut Me Down\\" were almost featured, but according to Andy McCluskey, \\"democracy won out\\".Waller, Johnny; Humphreys, Mike. Messages. Sidgwick & Jackson. 1987. . p. 169. Both tracks were included on the band's 40th anniversary retrospective boxset, Souvenir (2019), which carries a CD of unreleased material. 1983 holdover \\"Heaven Is\\" was nudged off The Pacific Age in favour of \\"Flame of Hope\\", but the song eventually surfaced on 1993's Liberator. Reception and legacy The Pacific Age met with negative reviews from the British music press.Waller, Johnny; Humphreys, Mike. Messages. Sidgwick & Jackson. 1987. . p. 173. Melody Maker described the record as \\"Wheezing, crumpled and limp... a bitter, bitter disappointment\\". In Sounds, it was portrayed as \\"Slick and slobbery, just a bunch of bored (sounding) professionals really\\". In a retrospective review, Trouser Press said: \\"Except for the smoothly contrived hit \\"(Forever) Live and Die\\" and the catchy \\"We Love You,\\" this dilettantish mess is less a set of songs than a meaningless collection of sounds.\\" A more favourable Dave Connolly of AllMusic noted OMD's \\"mastery of melody and mood\\" and \\"interesting patterns\\", but felt that much of the album is \\"more style than substance\\". In a 2013 online poll, The Pacific Age was voted the 46th best album of 1986 based on the opinions of almost 53,000 respondents. Frontman Andy McCluskey said that on The Pacific Age, the band had \\"lost the plot\\" due to being afforded \\"no real time to take stock and write some decent material\\"; he also feels that the album's production \\"just doesn't sound like [OMD]\\".

Feng was born on November 6, 1899. At eighteen he joined the Dongbei Army, and later entered a military school graduating in 1921. After he graduated, he was successively a platoon leader, company commander, and battalion commander. At the time of the Mukden Incident and Japanese invasion of northeast China he was a colonel commanding a regiment of the Kirin Guards Division. After the Mukden Incident, he opposed the Northeast border defense headquarters surrender to the Japanese forces, and commanded his troops on September 19 to withdraw from the Kirin provincial capital, and sent his troops during October to oppose the Japanese, fighting near Binxian. In at the end of January, 1932, Feng joined Ting Chao, Li Du, Xing Zhanqing, Zhao Yi to form the Jilin Self-Defence Army, and was chosen for assistant deputy commander and commanded troops in the defense of Harbin. After Ting's beaten forces retired from Harbin to the northeast down the Sungari River, to join the Lower Sungari garrison of Gen. Li Du. Feng Zhanhai withdrew his forces to Shan-Ho-Tun, a village in the Wuchang District. He then called for volunteers, and the Public Safety Bureaus in the local districts turned over to them their police and militia, and established Feng as the General in command of a force, the Northeastern Loyal and Brave Army, of 15,000 men in the hills with the capital of Kirin City to his south and the metropolis of Harbin to his north. There he was able to wreak havoc on the Japanese rail communications on the Chinese Eastern Railway running through his area of control. In response the Japanese and Manchukoans launched two campaigns to clear Feng's force out of the countryside. From June to July 1932 the Feng Chan-hai Subjugation Operation cleared the districts of Shuangcheng, Acheng, Yushu, Wuchang, and Shulan of Feng's Anti-Japanese forces. This forced Feng to retreat to the west. In September 1932 during the Second Feng Chan-hai Subjugation Operation a force of 7,000 Manchukuoans cornered the now 10,000 men Volunteer force \\"bandits\\" of Feng retreating from the previous attack. Although surrounded, over half the guerrillas were able to slip through the encirclement and make good their escape to Jehol. Later Feng's force joined in opposing the invasion of Jehol, and was forced to draw back into the area inside the Great Wall. Subsequently he participated in Feng Yuxiang's Chahar People's Anti-Japanese Army, as its Fourth Route Army commander in chief, against Japan and their Manchukuoan allied forces in the Dolonor area of Chahar. Following the dispersal of that force by Chiang Kai-shek, his force was formed into the 91st Division which Feng commanded until July 1938 when the Division suffered heavy casualties during the battle of Wuhan. He later left the army and went to Hong Kong to engage in business. In 1949 he returned to China assuming directorship of the Jilin Provincial Sports Committee. He also served in various government offices. Feng died on September 14, 1963.

Early life Lim was born and raised in Tondo, Manila from an impoverished family. When he was 5 or 6 years old, his family stayed in an informal settlement. It was around this time where the young Lim would use his passion in basketball as a means to climb out of hardship and support his family. Collegiate career Lim played for the De La Salle Green Archers from 1971 to 1974. In his rookie year, the Green Archers, led by himself and Mike Bilbao, won the 1971 NCAA men's basketball championship which was La Salle's first NCAA title in 15 years. Lim, who stood at 5'11 barefoot, was a deadly scorer that could single-handedly changed the complexion of a game. By the time he was a junior in 1973, he was getting various offers from teams in the MICAA. However, Lim opted to stay for one more year upon the proddings of the late Br. Gabriel Connon, the president of De La Salle College, promising that he would be getting something special in return. So for the final time, he suited up for the Green Archers. In his senior year, he averaged 32 points per outing in the 1974 season and set a single game record for the most points (men's basketball), which is 55 - a record which stands to this day. He was adjudged the Most Popular NCAA Player, was cast into the Mythical Five, received the Sportsmanship Award and ultimately won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. To cap his stellar collegiate career, he steered the Green Archers to the 1974 championship. As a reward for winning the 1974 NCAA men's basketball championship, Br. Connon declared that his jersey number, 14, would be retired. In 1998, he was inducted into the DLSAA Sports Hall of Fame. He claimed to have never missed a free throw during his college career. PBA career Lim first played for Concepcion-Carrier Weathermakers (known as Quasar TV Makers in the following year) in the PBA's inaugural season. He was traded to U/Tex Wranglers after the first conference of the 1976 season. As a wrangler, Lim won two PBA championships both in the Open Conference, first in 1978 and again in 1980 with Bogs Adornado as his teammate. After seven seasons with U/Tex from 1976-1982, Lim found himself being traded to San Miguel Beermen for Alex Tan prior to the start of the 1982 Third Conference. Lim was the Beermen's top scorer in the first two conferences of the 1983 season. He moved to Crispa in his 10th year as a pro, getting an opportunity to play for the winningest ballclub and won a championship with the Redmanizers. Retiring from the PBA in 1984 after 10 straight seasons, the former Green Archer return to action in the 1986 All-Filipino Conference with Manila Beer and played in all of their nine games. In his disappointing comeback with the Brewmasters, Lim could only sank a dismal eight-of-20 from the floor. Lim was named as one of the PBA's Greatest Players and inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame in 2013. =Career highlights= * PBA Mythical Team (1978) * Member, PBA 5,000 point club (1982) Post-PBA career In 1988, Lim became player/coach of AGFA Color in the Philippine Basketball League (PBL) until 1990. =Chinese Filipino basketball leagues= Lim started playing for Chiang Kai Shek College in 1968. With the help of his elder brother, he was recruited to its high school varsity squad where he led the team three consecutive championships. His team often travelled to Taipei, Taiwan each year to play for an invitational basketball tournament, where his shooting skills earned him great reputation among the Taiwanese youth. During his senior year after leading his school team to the championships for the third consecutive year, he was awarded the Most Outstanding Varsity Player by the school principal. He joined China Bank in Manila, in 1970, to play in the inter-bank tournament and won the championship trophy. In 1975, when he started playing in the newly created PBA (Philippine Basketball Association), the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce quickly awarded him as one of the four Most Outstanding Youth in the Chinese Filipino community. Continually playing in professional basketball from 1975 to 1986, he was one of the few Chinese Filipino athletes in the Philippines to be recognized as a superstar athlete and have inspired many youths to follow his footsteps. In 1989, the Chiang Kai Shek Alumni Association awarded him a plaque of appreciation for the Most Outstanding Player representing the Philippines in International Tournaments. From 1990 to 1999, he played as playing coach for his Batch 31 basketball team. From 1997 to 2001, he represented the PCFBL (Philippine Chinese Filipino Basketball League), as playing coach in the World Chinese Basketball Tournament and in the ASEAN Chinese Basketball League.

(Uzun Oluk olayƒ±) is a term used in modern Turkish historiography to refer to the first alleged armed action against the French occupying forces in Marash (present day Kahramanmara≈ü, Turkey) on October 31, 1919. As such, it is considered among Turkish historians as the beginning of the Battle of Marash.  Background  After the Armistice of Mudros was signed, Marash, Aintab and Adana (√áukurova) came under the occupation of British forces. In the autumn of 1919, the British handed control over of these regions to the French, who in October entered Marash. The French occupation force was primarily made up of troops from the French Colonial Forces and the French Armenian Legion. The Armenian Legion, comprising 2000 armed auxiliaries entered the city the day after, on 30 October.  Incident  =Turkish view of events= According to the version found in Turkish sources, on the night of 31 October, three Muslim women who were coming out of a public bath (hamam) on Uzunoluk street were accosted by an Armenian legionnaire and harassed and molested. The soldier attempted to tear off the veil of the women stating, \\"This is no longer the land of the Turks, you cannot walk around with a veil in French territory.\\" The women started to scream and ask for help. A neighbor, √áakmakcƒ± Sait, who ran forth without carrying a weapon was then shot and killed by the Armenian legionnaires. Soon after, an individual by the name of S√ºt√ß√º ƒ∞mam (literally, milkman Imam) opened fire on the Armenians, killing or wounding (depending on the version) one or more of the soldiers. Saral, Ahmet Hulki.

Basƒ±mevi, p. 58. After the incident, S√ºt√ß√º ƒ∞mam escaped and took refuge in a village nearby. The troops from the French Armenian Legion who arrived allegedly opened fire in retaliation at the civilians present on the spot and also killed a certain H√ºseyin, son of Z√ºlfikar √áavu≈ü. French soldiers arrested S√ºt√ß√º ƒ∞mam's cousin, Kadir, and tied his hands and feet from behind submitting him to torture and mutilation, by cutting his nose and ears. He died of suffocation while in custody. The tension sparked by these incidents increased gradually and led to the armed uprising against the French army in February 1920 (Battle of Marash). =Conflicting version= A much less dramatic account of the event is presented by an American relief worker who was working in Marash at the time, Stanley E. Kerr. According to an Armenian he interviewed years later for his book (who was unaware of the Turkish version), an Armenian rakiji (that is, a person who prepares the popular alcoholic drink rakƒ±) was serving several Armenian legionnaires with his drink when one of them, who was intoxicated after drinking one cup too many, approached a Muslim woman exiting the bath and removed her veil. An altercation followed and an unknown assailant shot and killed one of the legionnaires, but incidentally not the offending one.Kerr, Stanley E. The Lions of Marash: Personal Experiences with American Near East Relief, 1919-1922. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1973, p. 63. Memory In memory of this incident, Kahramanmara≈ü S√ºt√ß√º ƒ∞mam University is named after S√ºt√ß√º ƒ∞mam in 1992.

The HG&B; interchanged freight cars with other lines in the Hamilton Radial System, with the TH&B; [Kinnear Yard] and with the Grand Trunk [Winona]. Spur lines were constructed to Grimsby Park and the canning factories. The HG&B; derived a large amount of revenue by hauling fruit grown in the northern section of the Niagara Peninsula. It built a car shop in Grimsby and a coal- fired steam-electric D.C. generator at Stoney Creek. In 1904 the HG&B; began using A.C. power from Hamilton Cataract's hydro-electric generator at Decew Falls, two miles south of St. Catharines, It then converted its Stoney Creek D.C. station to an A.C. substation. A extension from Beamsville to Vineland opened in 1904 with the hope of a connection to St. Catharines. The connection was never made as bridging the Twenty Mile Creek ravine was economically unfeasible. The Vineland extension was abandoned in 1905 when local revenue was insufficient to cover operating costs, but its streetcar service was expanded to Oakville, with future plans to connect to the Toronto streetcar system in Port Credit. This failed to happen, and service was cut back to Burlington in 1925. In 1927, street car service stopped entirely. The company ended in 1931 when its line was abandoned and torn up.

Life She was the daughter of Nicholas III Zorzi, the titular margrave of Bodonitsa, and renowned for her beauty. After Nerio's death, she secured her right to act as guardian of her son and thereby regent of the Duchy and had the Ottomans consent to it. Not long after she came to power, she fell in love with the Venetian Bartolomeo Contarini, who visited Athens, and asked him to propose to her. He explained that he was already married, but to make himself able to marry Chiara, he returned to Venice, and murdered his wife, after which he returned to Athens and married the regent, in 1453. As her spouse, he also took a share in her government. The Athenians were not happy about the Venetian influence, and complaints reached the Ottoman Sultan. Evidently, the citizenry mistrusted the two lovers' influence over the young duke, for whose safety they may have feared. Mehmet II of the Ottoman Empire intervened at the insistence of the people on the behalf of the young duke Francis, and summoned Bartolomeo and his stepson the duke to his court at Adrianople. Duke Francesco I was never heard of again. Another Acciaioli, the young duke's cousin Francesco II, was sent to Athens as a Turkish client duke and Chiara thus deprived of her power in the city. The new duke had Chiara murdered at Megara. According to legend, the murder took place in the monastery of Daphni, the mausoleum of the French dukes, where he cut off her head himself while she knelt invoking the aid of the Holy Virgin, but this is a fictionalized version from a folk lore of the murder. Bartolomeo appealed to the sultan for justice. Athens was taken into Turkish hands, and Francis II deposed. References Sources * *Setton, Kenneth M. Catalan Domination of Athens 1311-1380\\\\.

It included social, cultural, but primarily political and military movements that reached their height during World War I and the following years. Influenced by the Age of Enlightenment and the rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire, the Armenian national movement developed in the early 1860s. Its emergence was similar to that of movements in the Balkan nations, especially the Greek revolutionaries who fought the Greek War of Independence.: \\"The Greek independence of 1832 served as an example for the Ottoman Armenians, who were also allowed to use their language in the print media earlier on.\\" The Armenian √©lite and various militant groups sought to defend the mostly rural Armenian population of the eastern Ottoman Empire from the Muslims, being Christian, but the ultimate goal was to push for reforms in the Six vilayets at first and after this failed, the creation of an Armenian state in the Armenian-populated areas controlled at the time by the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire. Since the late 1880s, the movement engaged in guerrilla warfare with the Ottoman government and the Kurdish irregulars in the eastern regions of the empire, led by the three Armenian political parties named the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party, the Armenakan Party and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. Armenians generally saw Russia as their natural ally in the fight against Turks although Russia maintained an oppressive policy in the Caucasus. Only after losing its presence in Europe after the Balkan Wars, the Ottoman government was forced to sign the Armenian reform package in early 1914, however it was disrupted by World War I. During World War I, the Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire were systematically exterminated by the government in the Armenian Genocide. According to some estimates, from 1894 to 1923, about 1,500,000‚Äî2,000,000 Armenians were killed by the Ottoman Empire. After the decision to exterminate the Armenians was taken by the Ottoman Ministry of Interior and first implemented with the Directive 8682 on February 25, 1915, tens of thousands of Russian Armenians joined the Russian army as Armenian volunteer units with a Russian promise for autonomy. By 1917, Russia controlled many Armenian-populated areas of the Ottoman Empire. After the October Revolution, however, the Russian troops retreated and left the Armenians irregulars one on one with the Turks. The Armenian National Council proclaimed the Republic of Armenia on May 28, 1918, thus establishing an Armenian state in the Armenian-populated parts of the Southern Caucasus. By 1920, the Bolshevik Government in Russia and Ankara Government had successfully came to power in their respective countries. The Turkish revolutionaries successfully occupied western half of Armenia, while the Red Army invaded and annexed the Republic of Armenia in December 1920. A friendship treaty was signed between Bolshevik Russia and Kemalist Turkey in 1921. The formerly Russian-controlled parts of Armenia were mostly annexed by the Soviet Union, in parts of which the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was established. Hundreds of thousands of genocide refugees found themselves in the Middle East, Greece, France and the US giving start to a new era of the Armenian diaspora. Soviet Armenia existed until 1991, when the Soviet Union disintegrated and the current (Third) Republic of Armenia was established.  Origins  Nationalism was an important factor in the development of Europe. In the 19th century, a wave of romantic nationalism swept the continent of Europe transforming the countries of the continent. Some new countries, such as Germany and Italy were formed by uniting smaller states with a common \\"national identity\\". Others, such as Romania, Greece, Poland and Bulgaria, were formed by winning their independence. Armenians were living among Ottoman Empire and Russian Empire during the rise of nationalism. In 1827-1828, Tsar Nicholas I in Russo-Persian War, 1826-1828 sought help from Armenians, promising that after the war, their lives would improve. In 1828, Russia annexed Yerevan, Nakhichevan, and the surrounding countryside with the Treaty of Turkmenchay. Armenians still living under Persian rule were encouraged to emigrate to Russian Armenia and 30,000 followed the call. In 1828, the Russians declared Russo-Turkish War, 1828-1829 and in the Treaty of Adrianople, Akhalkalak and Akhaltsikhe exchanged to Russia. There was a new wave of immigration as 25,000 Ottoman Armenians moved to Russian Armenia.Bournoutian. Armenian People, p. 105 Russia annexed significant portion of the Armenians. In 1897 Russian Census stated that 1,127,212 Armenians were in the Russian Lands (Erivan, 439,926; Elizavetpol, 298,790; Kars 72,967, Tiflis, 230,379, Baku, 52,770; Chernomorsk, 6,223 Daghestan, 1,652, Kutais, 24,505). At the same period (1896 Vital Cuinet) Armenians in the Ottoman Empire were 1,095,889 (Adana Vilayet, 97,450 Aleppo Vilayet, 37,999; Ankara Vilayet, 94,298; Bitlis Vilayet, 131,300; Bursa Vilayet, 88,991; Diy√¢r-ƒ± Bekr Vilayet 67,718; Erzurum Vilayet, 134,967; ƒ∞zmir Vilayet, 15,105; ƒ∞zmit, 48,655; Kastamonu Vilayet, 2,647; Mamure-ul-Azil Vilayet, 79,128; Sivas Vilayet, 170,433; Trebizond Vilayet, 47,20; Van Vilayet, 79,998)Vital Cuinet, La Turquie d'Asie: g√©ographie administrative, statistique, descriptive et raison√©e de chaque province de l'Asie-Mineure, 4 vols., Paris, 1890-95. There were many Armenians familiar with Russian customs. Russia, for Armenians, was also a path to Europe. In 1836, Russifican, Russian cultural advances included ‚Äúlimited‚Äù Russian reforms. Russia targeted the Armenian Church. Russia curtailed the Church's advances in the society. In 1839, attempting to stem the tide of nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire, Tanzim√¢t period emerged from the minds of reformist sultans like Mahmud II and Abd√ºlmecid I as well as prominent reformers who were European-educated bureaucrats. Tanzimat included the policy of Ottomanism, which was meant to unite all of the different peoples living in Ottoman territories, \\"Muslim and non-Muslim, Turkish and Greek, Armenian and Jewish, Kurd and Arab\\". For this purpose, Islamic law was put aside in favour of secular law.http://faith-matters.org/images/stories/fm-publications/the- tanzimat-final-web.pdf This policy officially began with the Imperial Rescript of the Rose Chamber of 1839, declaring equality before the law for both Muslim and non-Muslim Ottomans.The Invention of Tradition as Public Image in the Late Ottoman Empire, 1808 to 1908, Selim Deringil, Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1993), pp. 3-29 In 1863, Ottoman Armenians were introduced to a set of major reforms as an extension of Tanzimat. The Armenian National Constitution (150 articles drafted by Nahabet Rusinian, Servichen, Nigoghos Balian, Krikor Odian and Krikor Margosian) defined the condition of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, but also introduced regulations defining the authority of the Patriarch.Richard G. (EDT) Hovannisian \\"The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times\\", page 198 The constitution of the Armenian National Assembly was seen as a milestone by progressive Armenians. A second development was the introduction of elementary education, colleges and other institutions of learning by Protestant missionaries. Communications improved with the starting of Armenian newspapers. Books about Armenian history enabled a comparison of the past with current conditions and expanded readers' horizons. This was part of an evolution in Armenian political consciousness from purely cultural romanticism to a programme for action.Edmund Herzig \\"Armenians Past And Present In The Making Of National Identity A Handbook\\" page.76 1860 and onward, the number of Armenian schools, philanthropic and patriotic organizations multiplied in the Ottoman Empire. The initial aim of Protestant missionaries were the conversion of the Muslims and Jews, but soon they became involved with Protestant reformation of the Orthodox Armenians. The Armenian subjects of the Empire influenced by the Armenian Diaspora, the network of congregations and schools of the Protestant missionaries throughout the Ottoman Empire begin to rethink their position in the world. In 1872, the journalist Grigor Ardzruni from Ottoman Empire said ‚ÄúYesterday we were an ecclesiastical community, today we are patriots, tomorrow we will be a nation of workers and thinkers.‚Äù A parallel development occurred in Russian Armenia. Before 1840, Armenian journals were mainly in the hands of the clergy. This was changed. Along with the schools, the press played an important educational role and pointed the way to insurrection. From the first day when Rev. William Goodell settled in Constantinople in 1831 to the end of World War I, the missionaries made considerable contributions to the education of Armenians. The European intellectual currents such as ideas of French revolution were transmitted through the 23,000 Armenian students within 127 Protestant congregations with 13,000 communicants, and 400 schools.G. Warneck, Outline of a History of Protestant Missions (Edinburgh and London, 1901), p. 241. In the 1880s, after the Russian defeat in the Crimean War in 1856 and the Polish rebellion of 1861, Tsar Alexander II increased Russification to reduce the threat of future rebellions (Russia was populated by many minority groups). Tsar Alexander II attempted to prevent self- determinationistic tendencies and separatism. Armenian language, schools were targeted. Russia wanted to replace with Russian schools and Russian educational materials. = National Revival = The discovery of Urartu has come to play a significant role in 19th and 20th-century Armenian nationalism., p. 276. Kagik Ozanyan claims that Tanzimat regulations, helped the formation of an Armenian political strata and incited the Armenian national spirit, which was aligned with the nation building through revolution aligned with the French Revolution perspective.Esat Uras, Tarihte Ermeniler ve Ermeni Meselesi, ƒ∞stanbul 1976, 5. 463; The Russian Consul General to Ottoman Empire, General Mayewski, recorded the followingGeneral Mayewski ; Statistique des Provinces de Van et de Bitlis, pp. 11-13 The development of ideas of nationalism, salvation and independence, established during the late 19th century, along with the other national movements, as a nascent Armenian intelligentsia promoted the use of these new concepts in society with a particularly an Armenian import. The first wave of these concepts were developed by an Armenian intelligentsia which had studied in Western Europe under the influence of the French Revolution (1789). They were espoused a democratic-liberal ideology and the concept of the rights of man. The second wave come with the emergence of Russian revolutionary thought. At the end of the 19th century, the movement was based on a socialist ideology, specifically in its Marxist variant, specifically ARF. There was a major problem, the materialism and class struggle (Marxist variant) did not directly apply to the socioeconomics of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as much as to those in the Russian Armenia that had already achieved the Industrial Revolution. = Armenian majority = A basic form of \\"majority\\" is (consisting of more than half of a regions elements) or a plurality, (larger than any other group) considered for establishing a form governace (or a state). the Six vilayets or Six provinces were presented as the Armenian-populated vilayets (provinces) of the Ottoman Empire, while Erivan and Kars on the Russian side.  Founding  The development of ideas of nationalism, salvation and independence, established during the late 19th century, gathered momentum with the establishment of Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Social Democrat Hunchakian Party and Armenakan (later named as Ramgavar). The organized Armenian activities traced back to first known Armenian group, the \\"Union of Salvation,\\" before the three major groups established themselves. On March 3, 1872, 46 Armenians come together to build ‚ÄúUnion of Salvation (Armenian)‚Äù (different from the Russian Union of Salvation). The organization declared ‚ÄúGone is our honor; our churches have been violated; they kidnapped our brides and our youth; they have taken away our rights and try to exterminate our nation..‚Äù On April 26, 1872, villages around Van send a request ‚ÄúIn order to save ourselves from these evils, we are prepared to follow you even if we must shed blood or die. We are ready to go wherever... If the alternative to our present condition is to become Russified, let us be Russified together; if it is to be emigration, let us emigrate; if we are to die, let us die‚Äù This organization had not only direct contact with the Russian government but with certain Russian organization. These Russian organizations had goals to liberate the Ottoman Armenians from Ottoman Empire. Union of Salvation served a major step toward the formation of the first Armenian political party, the Armenakan. In 1881 Erzurum; Ottoman Armenians educated with the European Way began to make attempts in forming organizations ‚Äì secret societies - local groups, such as the 'Protectors of the Fatherland' (1881) which was established in Erzurum. Protectors of the Fatherland was almost certainly affected by the ideas of French revolution and Greek Revolution as 'Freedom or Death' was their motto.The Times, 10 January 1883, p. 5; ibid., 8 June 1883, p. 5 The protectors of the fatherland was significant Armenian organization. The constitution and the bylaws were memorized as written documents were dangerous. The membership was performed by sponsorship. Members are organized in tens, and only the leader had access to the central committee. After the first couple months in Erzurum membership became in hundreds. In 1885, the \\"Armenian Democratic Liberal Party\\" was established in Van by M√´k√´rtich Portukalian, who later went into exile in Marseilles but kept in touch with local leaders, and published a journal of political and social enlightenment titled L'Armenie. The Armenians of Van continued to develop the political principles behind Armenian nationalism, in secret. The party's aim soon become to 'win for the Armenians the right to rule themselves, through revolution'. Their view on how to liberate Armenia from the Ottoman Empire was that it should be through the press, national awakening and unarmed resistance. In 1887, the \\"Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (Hentchak, Hunchak) was the first Socialist party in the Ottoman Empire and in Persia by Avetis Nazarbekian, Mariam Vardanian, Gevorg Gharadjian, Ruben Khan-Azat, Christopher Ohanian, Gabriel Kafian and Manuel Manuelian, a group of college students who met in Geneva, Switzerland, with the goal to gain Armenia's independence from the Ottoman Empire. Hunchak means \\"Bell\\" in English, and was taken by party members to represent \\"awakening, enlightenment, and freedom.\\" In 1889 the Young Armenia Society was founded by Kristapor Mikayelian in Tbilisi. The Young Armenia Society organised Fedayee campaigns into Ottoman territory. The Young Armenia Society an armed expedition to Ottoman Armenia with the Gugunian Expedition. Its aims were the carrying out reprisals against Kurds persecuting Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. The society believed that the Russians would assist in the creation of an autonomous Armenian province under Russian rule. In 1890 the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (‚ÄúARF‚Äù or Dashnaktsutiun) was founded in Tiflis. Its members armed themselves into fedayee groups to defend Armenian villages from widespread oppression, attacks and persecution of the Armenians. It being seen as the only solution to save the people from Ottoman oppression and massacres. its initial aim was to guarantee reforms in the Armenian provinces and to gain eventual autonomy. During 1880-1890 the local communication channels were developed. The organizations were fully functional under Ankara, Amasya, √áorum, Diyarbakƒ±r, Yozgat, and Tokat. In 1893 they began to use wall newspapers (newspapers like billboards) directed toward the non Armenian subjects. The main theme of these materials were people should take control of their own life against the oppressors.Sir Robert W. Graves, Storm Centres of the Near East: personal memories, 1879-1929 These ideological communicants did not have any effect on the Muslims. These activities ended with clashes between revolutionaries and Ottoman police. Generally resulted with the jail time. Sultan panicked, and local authorities act against them as they were cutting telegraph wires, bombing the odd government buildings. Britain or European powers concluded that however if there would be more interference these would end with religious fanaticism, and a civil war (massacres) would occur.Graves, Storm Centres, pp. 132-139 = Notable figures = The partisan movement was established by these leaders. * ARF: Stepan Zorian, Christapor Mikaelian, Simon Zavarian * Armenakan: M√´k√´rtich Portukalian * Hentchak: Avetis Nazarbekian, Mariam Vardanian, Gevorg Gharadjian, Ruben Khan-Azat, Christopher Ohanian, Gabriel Kafian and Manuel Manuelian There were many notables besides the \\"founding leaders\\" listed. The classifications given below refer to the titles for which they are mostly remembered today. They served in multiple duties and ranks. = The Church = Armenian nationalism and Armenian religion (the Armenian Apostolic Church, a non-Chalcedonian church, which is also the world's oldest national church) is intertwined. The main voices of the movement were secular, as close to the turn of the century, Massis (published in the capitol), the Hiusissapile and Ardzvi Vaspurkan (published in the Van) became the main national organs (journals). These publications were secular. Major Armenian writers of the era, Mikael Nalbandian and Raphael Patkanian can be counted among the influential. Beginning with 1863, Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople began to share his powers with the Armenian National Assembly and his powers were limited by the Armenian National Constitution. He perceived the changes as erosion of his community.Migirditch, Dadian. (June 1867) \\"La society armenienne contemporaine\\", in Revue des deux Mondes, pp. 803-827 Armenian religious leaders played a key roles in the revolutionary movement. The Patriarch of Constantinople Mkrtich Khrimian was an important figure. Mkrtich Khrimian transferred to Jerusalem in his later years, although this was actually an exile. = Great Powers, Russo-Turkish War = Beginning in the mid-19th century, the Great Powers took issue with the Empire's treatment of its Christian minorities and increasingly pressured extend equal rights to all its citizens. Following the violent suppression of Christians in the uprisings in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria and Serbia in 1875, the Great Powers invoked the 1856 Treaty of Paris by claiming that it gave them the right to intervene and protect the Ottoman Empire's Christian minorities. By the late 1870s, the Greeks, along with several other Christian nations in the Balkans, frustrated with their conditions, had, with the help of the Powers, broken free of Ottoman rule. The Armenians, on the other hand, received less interest and no support that wasn't later withdrawn from the Great Powers and remained, by and large, stagnant during these years, earning them the title of 'millet-i sadika' or the \\"loyal millet\\". Armenian position changed as an intellectual class began to emerge among Armenian society. At the same time, the Armenian patriarchate of Constantinople, Nerses II of Constantinople (1874‚Äì1884), forwarded Armenian complaints of widespread \\"forced land seizure ... forced conversion of women and children, arson, protection extortion, rape, and murder\\" to the Powers. March 1878, after the conclusion of the 1877‚Äì78 Russo- Turkish War, the Armenians began to look more toward the Russian Empire as the ultimate guarantors of their security. Patriarch Nerses Varjabedyan approached the Russian leadership during the negotiations with the Ottomans in San Stefano and convinced them to insert a clause, Article 16 to Treaty of San Stefano, stipulating that the Russian forces occupying the Armenian-populated provinces in the eastern Ottoman Empire would withdraw only with the full implementation of reforms. June 1878, Great Britain was troubled with Russia's holding on to so much Ottoman territory in the \\"Treaty of San Stefano\\" and forced the parties for a new negotiations with the convening of the Congress of Berlin. The Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin contained the same text as Article 16 but removed any mention that Russian forces would remain in the provinces. Instead, the Ottoman government was periodically to inform the Great Powers of the progress of the reforms. The Armenian National Assembly and Patriarch Nerses II of Constantinople sent Catholicos Mgrdich Khrimian to present the case for the Armenians at Berlin; in his famous patriotic speech (following the Berlin negotiations) ‚ÄúThe Paper Ladle,‚Äù Mgrdich Khrimian advised Armenians to take the national awakening of Bulgaria (Liberation of Bulgaria) as a model as the hopes for self-determination were ignored by the European community of nations.Haig Ajemian, Hayotz Hayrig, page 511-3; translated by Fr. Vazken Movsesian. In Bulgarian historiography, Liberation of Bulgaria means the events of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 that led to the re-establishment of Bulgarian Sovereign state with the Treaty of San Stefano. In 1880 Armenians especially encouraged by the prime minister Gladstone touched the Armenian issue with the words ‚ÄúTo serve Armenia is to serve the Civilization. June 11, 1880, The great powers sent to porte an ‚ÄúIdentic Note‚Äù which asked for the enforcement of the article 61. This followed on January 2, 1881, with a British Circular on Armenia to other Powers. The \\"Young Armenia Society\\" believed that the Russians would assist in the creation of an autonomous Armenian province under Russian rule. The ARF is often accused of having tactics, even today viewed as still being, aimed at convincing Western governments and diplomatic circles to sponsor the party's demands. The Armenian national movement had discovered through their revolutionary movement that neither Tsar Alexander II with his idealism nor Gladstone's Liberalism was a dependable hope. = Armenian diaspora = Significant European and American movements began with the Armenian diaspora in France and in the U.S. as early as in the 1890s. The previous Armenian migrations were minor or and had not been statistically significant. In 1885, the Armenian Patriotic Society of Europe was established in Chesilton Road, Fulham, with its headquarters there. Its goal was that the Armenian diaspora should help those in their native land, both financially and raise Armenian political consciousness about its subject condition. Various political parties and benevolent unions, such as branches for the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, the Social-Democrat Henchagian party, and the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) which was initially founded in Constantinople, were established wherever there was a considerable number of Armenians. The Armenian diaspora played a significant role in every stage such as Armenian Revolutionary Federation in diaspora did not forgive what they saw as betrayal of the 'Free, Independent Armenia' (the motto of the party) and campaigned against the Soviet state in a variety of ways.  Activities (Ottoman Empire)  = Abdul Hamid II Era = The emergence of the Armenian Partisan Movement in the early 1880s and the armed struggle by the late 1880s fall into the Sultan Abdul Hamid II's reign. Abdul Hamid II come to rule where he oversaw a period of decline in the power and extent of the Empire. He ruled from 31 August 1876 until he was deposed on 27 April 1909.  Armed movement  The partisan movement organized around Armenian centers, such that before ARF replaced the Armenakans, Armenakans mainly operated in and around the city of Van. There are advantages to look events using the regions as the groups were organized regional bases. = Capitol = The Kum Kapu demonstration occurred in the Kumkapƒ± district of Constantinople on July 27, 1890. The cause of the demonstrations were \\"..to awaken the maltreated Armenians and to make the Sublime Porte fully aware of the miseries of the Armenians.\\"Khan-Azat, op. cit., VI (February 1928), pp. 124-125 The Hunchaks had come to a conclusion that the demonstrations at Kum Kapu were unsuccessful. Similar demonstration on a lesser scale followed throughout most of the 1890s.Hovhanissian, Richard G. (1997) The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times. New York. St. Martin's Press, 218-9 The 1896 Ottoman Bank Takeover was the seizing of the Ottoman Bank in Constantinople, on 26 August 1896. Bank takeover was planned by members of the ARF. In an effort to raise further awareness and action by the major European powers, 28 armed men and women led primarily by Papken Siuni and Karekin Pastirmaciyan (Armen Karo) took over the bank which largely employed European personnel from Great Britain and France. Stirred largely due to the inaction of the European powers in regards to pogroms and massacres instigated by the Sultan Abdul-Hamid II. The ARF members saw its seizure as their best attempt to bring full attention to the massacres. The Yƒ±ldƒ±z assassination attempt was a failed assassination attempted on Sultan Abdul Hamid II by the ARF at Yƒ±ldƒ±z Mosque on July 21, 1905. = Van/Bitlis Vilayets (Lake Van Region) = Certain geographical and ethnic factors favored Van as a center. The lake van is the frontier to Russia and Persia, which assistance from was easily accessible. In May 1889, Bashkale Resistance was the bloody encounter of three revolutionaries of Armenakan. Bashkale was a town in the Van Province. The comrades Karapet Koulaksizian, Hovhannes Agripasian, and Vardan Goloshian were stopped and demanded that they disarm. On them were two documents addressed to Koulaksizian, one from Avetis Patiguian of London and the other from M√´k√´rtich Portukalian, in Marseille. Ottoman's believed that the men were members of a large revolutionary apparatus and the discussion was reflected on newspapers, (Eastern Express, Oriental Advertiser, Saadet, and Tarik) and the responses were on the Armenian papers. In some Armenian circles, this event was considered as a martyrdom and brought other armed conflicts. The Defense of Van was the Armenian population in Van defense against the Ottoman Empire in June, 1896. The Khanasor Expedition was the Armenian militia's response on July 25, 1897, to the Defense of Van, where Mazrik tribe ambushed a squad of Armenian defenders and mercilessly slaughtered them. The Battle of Holy Apostles Monastery was an armed conflict of the Armenian militia in Holy Apostles Monastery near Mush, in November 1901. Andranik Ozanian's intentions were to attract the attention of the foreign consuls at Mush to the plight of the Armenian peasants and to provide a glimmer of hope for the oppressed Armenians of the eastern provinces. = Diyarbekir/Aleppo Vilayets = Sason was formerly part of the sanjak of Siirt which was in Diyarbakƒ±r vilayet of the Ottoman Empire, later part of Batman Province of Turkey. Zeitun was formerly part of the Aleppo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire, later S√ºleymanlƒ± in the Kahramanmara≈ü Province of Turkey. The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party and the ARF were active in the region. 1862 was important for Zeitun. The Armenians of Zeitun had historically enjoyed a period of high autonomy in the Ottoman Empire until the nineteenth century. In the first half of the nineteenth century, the central government decided to bring this region of the empire under tighter control. This strategy ultimately proved ineffective. In the summer of 1862 the Ottomans sent a military contingent of 12,000 men to Zeitun to reassert government control. The force, however, was held at bay by the Armenians and, through French mediation, the first Zeitun resistance was brought to a close. The Zeitun Armenian's gave inspiration to the ideas of creating an Armenian state in Cilicia. The Sasun resistance of 1894 was the resistance of the Hunchak militia of the Sassoun region. The region continued to be in conflict between the fedayee and the Muslim Ottomans between the local Armenian villages. Between the years 1891 and 1895, activists from the Armenian Social Democrat Hunchakian Party visited Cilicia, and established a new branch in Zeitun. The Zeitun Rebellion took place in 1895. In spring 1902, a representative of the ARF, Vahan Manvelyan, was sent to in Sason with the purpose of stopping the insignificant skirmishes, but only irritating the Muslims. In February 1903, Sofia, at the III Congress ARF, it was decided to assign Sason of committee fighting groups. Hrayr Dzhoghk went to Van where he made organize the Sasun (1902). Alongside Hrayr Dzhoghk was Andranik. Andranik became the main organizer and head of Sasun Uprising of 1904. Hrayr Dzhoghk was killed on April 13 in village Gelieguzan. He was buried in a court of a local church near to Serob Pa≈üa. The Sassoun Uprising was the resistance of the Armenian militia in the Sassoun region.  Armenian reform program  During 1880 - 1881, while the Armenian national liberation movement was in its early stage; lack of outside support and inability to maintain a trained, organized Kurdish force diminished Kurdish aspirations. However, two prominent Kurdish families (tribes) mounted opposition to the empire, based more from an ethno-nationalistic stand point. The Badr Khans were successionists while the Sayyids of Nihiri were autonomists. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 was followed in 1880 - 1881 by the attempt of Shaykh Ubayd Allah of Nihri to found an \\"independent Kurd principality\\" around Ottoman-Persian border (including the Van Vilayet) where Armenian population was significant. Shaykh Ubayd Allah of Nihri gathered 20,000 fighters. Lacking discipline, his man left the ranks after pillaging and acquiring riches from the villages in the region (indiscriminately, including Armenian villages). Shaykh Ubayd Allah of Nihri captured by the Ottoman forces in 1882 and this movement ended. = Security, Reform, Order = The Kurdish (force, rebels, bandits) sacked neighboring towns and villages with impunity.Astourian, Stepan (2011). \\"The Silence of the Land: Agrarian Relations, Ethnicity, and Power,\\" in A Question of Genocide: Armenians and Turks at the End of the Ottoman Empire, eds. Ronald Grigor Suny, Fatma M√ºge G√∂√ßek, and Norman Naimark. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 58-61, 63-67. The central assumption of the Hamidiye system‚ÄîKurdish tribes (Kurdish chiefdoms cited among Armenian security concerns) could be brought under military discipline‚Äîproved to be \\"Utopian\\". The Persian Cossack Brigade later proved that it can function as independent unit, but Ottoman example, which was modeled after, never replaced the tribal loyalty to Ottoman Sultan or even to its establishing unit. In 1892, first time a trained and organized Kurdish force encouraged by the Sultan Abdul Hamid II. It was established by and named after Sultan. The Hamidiye corps or Hamidiye Light Cavalry Regiments were well-armed, irregular, majority Kurdish cavalry (minor amounts of other nationalities, such as Turcoman) formations that operated in the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire.Shaw, Stanford J. and Ezel Kural Shaw, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977, vol. 2, p. 246. They were intended to be modeled after the Caucasian Cossack Regiments (example Persian Cossack Brigade) and were firstly tasked to patrol the Russo-Ottoman frontier and secondly, to reduce the potential of Kurdish-Armenian cooperation.Safrastian, Arshak. 1948 Kurds and Kurdistan. Harvill Press, pg 66. The Hamidiye Cavalry was in no way a cross-tribal force, despite their military appearance, organization, and potential. Hamidiye quickly find out that they could only be tried through a military court martial They became immune to civil administration. Realizing their immunity, they turned their tribes into ‚Äúlegalized robber brigades‚Äù as they steal grain, reap fields not of their possession, drive off herds, and openly steal from shopkeepers. Kurdish chieftain also taxed the population of the region in sustaining these units, which Armenian's perceived this Kurdish taxation as an exploitation. When Armenian spokesmen confronted the Kurdish chieftain (issue of double taxation), it brought about enmity between both populations. The Hamidiye cavalry harassed and assaulted Armenians.Hovannisian, Richard The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume II: Foreign Dominion to Statehood: The Fifteenth Century to the Twentieth Century. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1997, p. 217. . In 1908, after the overthrow of Sultan, the Hamidiye Cavalry was disbanded as an organized force, but as they were ‚Äútribal forces‚Äù before official recognition, they stayed as ‚Äútribal forces‚Äù after dismemberment. The Hamidiye Cavalry is described as a military disappointment and a failure because of its contribution to tribal feuds. = Hamidian massacres = A major role in the Hamidian massacres of 1894‚Äì96 has been often ascribed to the Hamidiye regiments, particularly during the bloody suppression of Sasun (1894). On July 25, 1897, the Khanasor Expedition was against the Kurdish Mazrik tribe (Muzuri Kurds) who owned a significant portion of this cavalry. The Hamidian massacres were brought to an end through mediation by the Great Powers. However instead of Armenian autonomy in these regions, Kurds (Kurdish tribal chiefs) retained much of their autonomy and power.Denise Natali. The Kurds and the State. (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2005) The Abdulhamid made little attempt to alter the traditional power structure of ‚Äúsegmented, agrarian Kurish societies‚Äù ‚Äì agha, shayk, and tribal chief. Because of their geographical position at the southern and eastern fringe of the empire and mountainous topography, and limited transportation and communication system. The state had little access to these provinces and were forced to make informal agreements with tribal chiefs, for instance the Ottoman qadi and mufti did not have jurisdiction over religious law which bolstered Kurdish authority and autonomy.  Abdul Hamid II's position  Sultan Abdul Hamid II wanted to reinforce the territorial integrity of the embattled Ottoman Empire, reasserted Pan-Islamism as a state ideology. Abdul Hamid II perceived the Ottoman Armenians to be an extension of foreign hostility, a means by which Europe could \\"get at our most vital places and tear out our very guts.\\" = Second Constitutional Era = The Armenians supported the Young Turk Revolution, whose concepts were present in varying proportions among Armenians at the turn of the 20th centuryDer Minassian, Anahide, \\"Nationalisme et socialisme dans le Mouvement Revolutionnaire Armenien\\", in \\"LA QUESTION ARMENIENNE\\", Paris, 1983, pp. 73-111. After the revolution, the Ottoman Empire in the Second Constitutional Era was struggling to keep its territories and promoting Ottomanism among its citizens. ARF, previously outlawed, became the main representative of the Armenian community in the Ottoman Empire, replacing the pre-1908 Armenian elite, which had been composed of merchants, artisans, and clerics who had seen their future in obtaining more privileges within the boundaries of the state's version of Ottomanism. During the same time the Armenian Revolutionary Federation was moving out of this context and developing, what was just a normal extension of its national freedom concept, the concept of the \\"Independent Armenian State\\". With this national transformation ARF's activities become a national cause.Dasnabedian, Hratch, \\"The ideological creed\\" and \\"The evolution of objectives\\" in \\"A BALANCE-SHEET OF THE NINETY YEARS\\", Beirut, 1985, pp. 73-103 ARF, in the early 20th century was socialists, and marxist which can be seen from the party's first program.Documents for the history of the ARF, II, 2nd Edition, Beirut, 1985, pp. 11-14  Armed movement  = Van/Bitlis Vilayets (Lake Van Region) = At the 1907 Battle of Sulukh, Kevork Chavush was critically wounded on May 25, 1907, during a large firefight with the Ottoman army in Sulukh, Mush. Kevork Chavush escaped the fighting. Two days later his body was found in Kyosabin-Bashin on May 27 under a bridge. = Balkans = The Armenians settled between the 6th and the 11th century in the Rhodopes, Thrace and Macedonia were several thousand in number and were mostly Paulicians and Tondrakians. Later as the Ottoman Empire extended towards the Europe, a minor amount of Armenians moved along the frontiers and settled throughout the Balkans. At the time of the Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì1913) the Armenians in Bulgaria were about 35,000. Andranik Ozanian participated in the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913, within the Bulgarian army, alongside general Garegin Nzhdeh as a commander of Armenian auxiliary troops. Andranik met revolutionist Boris Sarafov in Sofia and the two pledged themselves to work jointly for the oppressed peoples of Armenia and Macedonia. Andranik participated in the First Balkan War of 1912‚Äì1913 alongside Garegin Nzhdeh as a Chief Commander of 12th Battalion of Lozengrad Third Brigade of the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan militia under the command of Colonel Aleksandar Protogerov. His detachment consisted of 273 Armenian volunteers, which was more than half of the 531 non-Macedonian born fighters in the group. On October 20, the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan militia and Andranik's volunteer detachment, tight circle around Edirne and surrendered Yaver Pasha's forces. On November 4, 1912, the Macedonian- Adrianopolitan militia with the support of Andranik's volunteer detachment defeated numerically exceeding Turks near Momchilgrad. On January 6, 1913, in a small town church in Rodosto, Aleksandar Protogerov awarded all Armenian fighters for bravery. Andranik Ozanyan was honored with the Order of Bravery.  The Ottoman parliament  The new parliament comprised 142 Turks, 60 Arabs, 25 Albanians, 23 Greeks, 12 Armenians (including four from ARF and two from Hunchaks), 5 Jews, 4 Bulgarians, 3 Serbs and 1 Vlach in the elections of 1908. The \\"Committee of Union and Progress\\" (CUP) could count on the support of about 60 deputies and became the main party.Philip Mansel, \\"Constantinople City of the Worlds Desire\\" quoted in Straits: The origins of the Dardanelles campaign Karekin Pastermadjian became a member of the Ottoman parliament part from the ARF deputies. During his four years as a deputy, he worked for the railroad bill. Main object was to build railroads as soon as possible in the vilayets which were considered to be Russia's future possessions. For that reason neither France nor Germany wished to undertake it. Another fundamental object was to build those lines with American capital, which would make it possible to counteract the Russo-Franco-German policies and financial intrigues. But in spite of all efforts unable to overcome the German opposition, although, as the outcome of the struggle in connection with that bill, two ministers of public works were forced to resign their post.  The reform package  The politics in Istanbul was centered around trying to find a solution to the demands of Arab and Armenian reformist groups. 19th century politics of Ottoman Empire dealt with the decentralize demands of the Balkan nations. The same pattern was originating from the eastern provinces. With most of the Christian population having already left the Empire after the Balkan Wars, a redefinition of Ottoman politics was in place with a greater emphasis on Islam as a binding force. The choice of this policy should also be considered as external forces (imperialists) were Christians. It was a policy of \\"them against us\\". in 1913 Karekin Pastermadjian had taken active a part in the conferences held for the consideration of the Armenian reforms. He was in Paris and the Netherlands, as the delegate of the ARF, to meet the inspectors general who were invited to carry out the reforms. The reform package was signed in February 1914, between the Ottoman Empire represented by Grand Vezir Said Halim Pasha and Russia. L. C. Westenenk, an administrator for the Dutch East Indies, and Major Hoff, a major in the Norwegian Army, were selected as the first two inspectors. Hoff was in Van when the war broke out, just as Westenenk was preparing to depart for his post in Erzerum. L. C.

Vol. 19, No. 2 (2010), pp. 93-108.  Committee of Union and Progress's position  Once in power, the Committee of Union and Progress introduced a number of new initiatives intended to promote the modernization of the Ottoman Empire. CUP advocated a program of orderly reform under a strong central government, as well as the exclusion of all foreign influence. CUP promoted industrialization and administrative reforms. Administrative reforms of provincial administration quickly led to a higher degree of centralization.  Activities (Russian Empire)  = Edict on Armenian church property 1903-1904 = The tsar's Russification programme reached its peak with the decree of June 12, 1903, confiscating the property of the Armenian Church. Mkrtich Khrimian (Catholicos of Armenia) revolted against the tsar. When the Tsar refused to back down the Armenians turned to the ARF. The Armenian clergy had previously been very wary of the ARF, condemning their socialism as anti-clerical. However, ARF acquired significant support and sympathy in Russian administration. Mainly because of the ARF's attitude to the Ottoman Empire, the party enjoyed the support of the central Russian administration, as tsarist and ARF foreign policy had the same alignment until 1903. The edict on Armenian church property was faced by strong ARF opposition, because it perceived a tsarist threat to Armenian national existence. In 1904, the Dashnak congress specifically extended their programme to support the rights of Armenians in the Russian Empire as well as Ottoman Turkey. As a result, the ARF leadership decided to actively defend Armenian churches. The ARF formed a Central Committee for Self-Defence in the Caucasus and organised a series of protests. At Gandzak the Russian army responded by firing into the crowd, killing ten, and further demonstrations were met with more bloodshed. The Dashnaks and Hunchaks began a campaign of assassination against tsarist officials in Transcaucasia and they succeeded in wounding Prince Golitsin. The events convinced Tsar Nicholas that he must reverse his policies. He replaced Golitsin with the Armenophile governor Count Illarion Ivanovich Vorontsov-Dashkov and returned the property of the Armenian Church. Gradually order was restored and the Armenian bourgeoisie once more began to distance itself from the revolutionary nationalists.Ternon. Les Arm√©niens, pp. 159-62 = Armenian-Azeri massacres 1904-1905 = Unrest in Transcaucasia, which also included major strikes, reached a climax with the widespread uprisings throughout the Russian Empire known as the 1905 Revolution. 1905 saw a wave of mutinies, strikes and peasant uprisings across imperial Russia and events in Transcaucasia were particularly violent. In Baku, the centre of the Russian oil industry, class tensions mixed with ethnic rivalries. The city was almost wholly composed of Azeris and Armenians, but the Armenian middle-class tended to have a greater share in the ownership of the oil companies and Armenian workers generally had better salaries and working conditions than the Azeris. In December 1904, after a major strike was declared in Baku, the two communities began fighting each other on the streets and the violence spread to the countryside. = Tribune of People, 1912 = In January 1912, a total of 159 Armenians were charged with membership of an anti-\\"Revolutionary\\" organisation. During the revolution Armenian revolutionaries were split into \\"Old Dashnaks\\", allied with the Kadets and \\"Young Dashnaks\\" aligned with the SRs. To determine the position of Armenians all forms of Armenian national movement put into trial. The entire Armenian intelligentsia, including writers, physicians, lawyers, bankers, and even merchants\\" on trial.Abraham, Richard (1990). Alexander Kerensky: The First Love of the Revolution. New York: Columbia University Press, pg. 53,54 When the tribune finished its work, 64 charges were dropped and the rest were either imprisoned or exiled for varying periods  Activities during World War I  Beginning at the end of July and ending on August 2, 1914, the Armenian congress at Erzurum was a watershed event between the Ottoman government (Committee of Union and Progress) and Ottoman Armenian citizens. The conversation between groups were established with the Armenian liaisons Simon Vratsian, Arshak Vramian, Rostom (Stepan Zorian), and E. Aknouni (Khatchatour Maloumian) and Ottoman liaisons Dr. Behaeddin Shakir, Omer Naji (Omer Naci), and Hilmi Bey, also accompanied by an international entourage of peoples from the Caucasus. Committee of Union and Progress requested from Ottoman Armenians to facilitate the conquest of Transcaucasia by inciting a rebellion (with the Russian Armenians) against the tsarist army in the event of a Caucasus Campaign.Taner Akcam, A Shameful Act, page 136Richard G. Hovannisian, The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times, 244 The Ottoman plan was to draw the Persians, Kurds, Tatars and Georgians into a holy war against the Allies. In order to carry this project it was necessary to make sure that Armenian geographical position would not hamper cooperation between these races. If this agreement went forward and the Ottoman Armenians did not support the Russians, they would be offered autonomy. This offer was one step forward from Armenian reform package, which was already established in February 1914. The Tsar promised autonomy for Russian Armenia. A representative meeting of Russian Armenians assembled in Tiflis, Caucasus, during August 1914.The Encyclopedia Americana, 1920, v.28, p.412 The Tsar promised autonomy to six Turkish Armenian vilayets as well as the two Russian-Armenian provinces.Joseph L. Grabill, (1971) Protestant Diplomacy and the Near East: Missionary Influence on American Policy, 1810-1927, page 59, Tsar asked Armenian's loyalty and support for Russia in the conflict. The proposal was agreed upon and nearly 20,000 Armenians, Armenian volunteer units, served with the Russian colors. The Armenians were quite willing to remain loyal to their government, but declared their inability to agree to the other proposal, that of inciting their compatriots under Russian rule to insurrection. In spite of these promises and threats, the executive committee of the ARF informed the Turks that the Armenians could not accept the Turkish proposal, and on their behalf advised the Turks not to participate in the present war, which would be very disastrous to the Turks themselves. = Armed movement = The Russian Armenian Volunteer Corps was a military fighting unit within the Imperial Russian Army. Composed of several groups at battalion strength, its ranks were exclusively made up of Armenians from the Russian Empire, though there were also a number of Armenian from the Ottoman Empire. In August 1914, following Germany's declaration of war against Russia, Count Illarion Vorontsov-Dashkov, the Russian viceroy of the Caucasus, approached Armenian leaders in the Tiflis to broach the idea of a formation of a separate fighting corps. His offer was received warmly and within a few weeks Armenian volunteers began to enlist. Responsibility for its formation was given to a special committee created by the Armenian National Council, which coordinated its activities from Tiflis, Yerevan and Alexandrapol.  Initial  In November 1914, Drastamat Kanayan had the 2nd battalion of the Armenian volunteers. At the Bergmann Offensive, the 2nd battalion of the Armenian volunteers engaged in battle for the first time, near Bayazid. In the course of a bloody combat which lasted twenty-four hours, commander of the battalion, was seriously wounded. From that day to March of the following year, Drastamat Kanayan remained in critical condition. The Battle of Sarikamish took place from December 22, 1914, to January 17, 1915, as part of the Caucasus Campaign. The Ottomans employed a strategy which demanded that their troops be highly mobile and to arrive at specified objectives at precise times.The Encyclopedia Americana, 1920, v.28, p.404 Along the Kars Oblast, the 3rd battalion commanded by Hamazasp (Srvandztian) and 4th battalion by Keri (Arshak Gavafian) operated on the front facing Erzurum between Sarikamish and Oltu.Richard G. Hovannisian, 2003, Armenian Karin/Erzerum, Mazda Publishers, p.367, 4th battalion of the Armenian volunteers engaged at Barduz Pass. The Ottoman army suffered a delay of 24 hours in the Barduz Pass, and 4th battalion of the Armenian volunteers lost 600 troops in a battle there. On December 16, 1914, the Ottoman Empire dismantled the Armenian reform package, just after the first engagement of the Caucasus Campaign the Bergmann Offensive. On the other side, the Tsar visited the Caucasus front on December 30, 1914, telling the head of the Armenian Church that \\"a most brilliant future awaits the Armenians\\".Martin Gilbert, 2004, \\"The First World War,\\" Macmillan p.108Avetoon Pesak Hacobian, 1917, Armenia and the War, p.78  The first year  Between April 15‚Äì18 of 1915, the brigade of Armenian volunteers under the command of Andranik valiantly participated in the Battle of Dilman of the Persian Campaign. Drastamat Kanayan though remained in critical condition, his battalion led into eleven battles in the neighborhood of Alashkert, Toutakh, and Malashkert, until Drastamat Kanayan recovered and returned to resume the command. The Red Sunday the leaders of the Armenian community were arrested and moved to two holding centers near Ankara upon the order of the Minister of the Interior Mehmed Talaat Bey of April 24, 1915. Mehmed Talaat Bey gave the detention order on April 24, 1915, which commenced at 8 p.m. by Chief of Police of Constantinople Bedri Bey. Hampartsoum Boyadjian, a Hunchakian, was among the first to be arrested in April 1915 at Red Sunday. After a trial in July, he was hanged on 24 August 1915, with 12 comrades.–î–∂.–ö–∏—Ä–∞–∫–æ—Å—è–Ω. –ú–ª–∞–¥–æ—Ç—É—Ä–∫–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥ —Å—É–¥–æ–º –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏–ö–µ—Å–∞—Ä–∏—è On May 6, 1915, Andranik was the commanding officer of the first Armenian volunteer detachment (about 1,200 soldiers), which helped lift the Siege of Van. Theodore G. Chernozubov for the successes of Andranik in Ashnaka, Vrush-Khoran, Khanika, Kotur, Saray, Molla-Hasan, Belenjik and Garateli stated significantly associated with the fighting of the 1st Armenian volunteers, headed by Andranik. Chernozubov praised Andranik as a brave and experienced chief, who well understood the combat situation, described him as always at the head of militia, enjoying great prestige among the volunteers. On June 15, 1915, The Twenty Martyrs from Hunchakian leaders, after spending two years in terrible conditions in Ottoman prisons, and undergoing lengthy mock trials, twenty prominent figures - Paramaz, Dr. Benne, Aram Ach'ekbashian, Vanig and others were sentenced to death by hanging. All twenty men were hanged in the central square of Constantinople, known as Sultan Bayazid Square. Paramaz's last words before his hanging were: In July 1915, Khetcho (Catchik), Karekin Pastermadjian's assistant and commander, died on the shores of Lake Van File:Hunchak leaders hung.jpgHunchakian leaders, The Twenty Martyrs File:Khetcho Commander of cavalry Armenian volunteer units.png WW1 Armenian volunteer soldier with gun.pngVolunteer soldier  The second year  The biggest achievement of the first year was the Armenian governing of the Administration for Western Armenia, (Republic of Van) with Aram Manukian as the head. The Republic of Van was a temporary Armenian provisional government between 1915 and 1918. It was also briefly referred as Free Vaspurakan.Robert-Jan Dwork Holocaust: A History by Deborah and van Pelt, p 38 Andranik commanded a battalion that defeated Halil Pasha during the Battle of Bitlis in 1916. Negotiations with the French for returning Armenian refugees to their homes in Cilicia were performed with leadership of Boghos Nubar. Negotiations were directed by Quai d'Orsay which is a metonymy to French Ministry Foreign Affairs. Foreign Minister Aristide Briand seized this opportunity to provide troops for French commitment made in Sykes-Picot Agreement, which was still secret at the time.Stanley Elphinstone Kerr. The Lions of Marash: personal experiences with American Near East Relief, 1919-1922 p. 30 Armenian leadership also meet with Sir Mark Sykes and Georges Picot. The Legion (force) was established officially in Cairo, Egypt in November 1916. The force named as French Armenian Legion and planned under the command of General Edmund Allenby. However, beginning with 1917 and not in the original agreement, this Armenian force fought in Palestine, Syria.  The third year  The February Revolution of 1917 caused chaos among Russian soldiers in the Caucasus Front and by the end of that year most Russian soldiers left the front and returned to their homes. In July 1917 six Armenian regiments were created in the Caucasus Front with support of Armenian organizations in Petrograd and Tiflis. As of October 1917 two Armenian divisions were already created, with Tovmas Nazarbekian at their head. As of early 1918 only few thousand Armenian volunteers under the command of two hundred officers opposed the Turkish offenses. In the spring of 1917, Karekin Pastermadjian and Dr. Hakob Zavriev, was sent from the Caucasus to Petrograd to negotiate with the temporary Russian government concerning Caucasian affairs. Karekin Pastermadjian left for America in June 1917 as the representative of the Armenian National Council of Tiflis and as the special envoy of the Catholicos of all the Armenians, On December 5, 1917, the armistice of Erzincan was signed between the Russians and Ottomans, ending armed conflicts between the two states. After the Bolshevik seizure of power, a multinational congress of Transcaucasian representatives met to create a provisional regional executive body known as Transcaucasian Seim.  Last year  In 1918, the Russian authorities made Andranik a Major General and decorated him six times for gallantry, the source stated as general Antranik as a command of the Armenian and Russian forces against those of the Turks; was in 59 engagements, several horses shot under him but kept fighting after the czar's army collapsed.New York Times, September 2, 1927, p. 17 The roots of the first national republic was achieved by the Armenians under Russian control which devised a national congress in October 1917. The convention in Tiflis was concluded in September 1917 with delegates from former Romanov realm (203), which 103 belonged to the ARF. On March 3, 1918, the Russians followed the armistice of Erzincan with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and left the war, with territorial losses. From March 14 to April 1918, when a conference was held between the Ottoman Empire and the delegation of the Seim. When the first Republic of Armenia (First Republic of Armenia) was proclaimed in 1918, the ARF became the ruling party. Between March and April 1918 Andranik was the governor of the Administration for Western Armenia. Karekin Pastermadjian was assigned as the ambassador of the First Republic of Armenia to the United States in Washington, D.C. The original plan for the Armenian army was to consist of Tovmas Nazarbekian's 60,000 soldiers with Andranik Pasha's 30,000 fedayees. However after the splitting of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, the Ottoman Empire had taken Alexandropol and were intent on eliminating the center of Armenian resistance based in Yerevan. After the formation of the First Republic of Armenia in May 1918 Andranik fought alongside volunteer units to combat the Ottoman army. The Armenians were able to prevent total elimination and delivered crushing blows to the Turkish army in the battles of Sardarapat, Karakilisa and Abaran. The First Republic of Armenia had to sign the Treaty of Batum, which was signed in Batum on June 4, 1918. It was the ADR's first treaty. After the Ottoman Empire took vast swathes of territory and imposed harsh conditions, the new republic was left with 10,000 square kilometers. Andranik's military leadership was instrumental in allowing the Armenian population of Van to escape the Ottoman Army and flee to Eastern Armenia. By July inter ethnic warfare had started in Zangezur. Armenian couriers dispatched to Yerevan pleaded for officers and materiel. The Republic couldn't support irregular forces fighting in the south. At the critical moment General Andranik arrived in Zangezur with an irregular division estimated with about 3 to 5 thousand men and 40,000 refugees and the occupied provinces of Russian Armenia.Hovannisian, Richard G. The Republic of Armenia: The First Year, 1918‚Äì1919. Berkeley: University of California, 1971, pp. 86‚Äì87. As the commander of Armenian forces in Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic, Andranik has declared that his army is determined to continue the war against Ottoman Empire.\\"More British in Russia,\\" The New York Times, August 17, 1918, p. 1. His activities were concentrated at the link between the Ottoman Empire and the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic at Karabakh, Nakhchivan, and Zangezur. Andranik and his troops were 40 km (25 mi) from Shusha, the most important city of Karabakh at the time, in early December 1918. Just before the Armistice of Mudros was signed, Andranik was on the way from Zangezur to Shusha, to control the main city of Karabakh. In January 1919 Armenian troops advancing, the British general William M. Thomson gave Andranik assurances that a favorable treaty would be reached at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, pp. 88‚Äì90. On July 26, 1918, the Centrocaspian Dictatorship was a short-lived anti-Soviet client state proclaimed in Baku, forged by the Mensheviks and the ARF, this unrecognized state replaced the Bolshevik Baku Commune in a bloodless coup d'√©tat. The Baku forces mainly commanded by Colonel Avetisov. Under his command were about 6,000 Centrocaspian Dictatorship troops of the Baku Army. The vast majority of the troops in this force were Armenians, though there were some Russians among them. Their artillery comprised some 40 field guns. Most of the Baku Soviet troops and practically all their officers were Armenians of ARF affiliation.Firuz Kazemzadeh. Struggle For Transcaucasia (1917‚Äî1921), New York Philosophical Library, 1951 Centrocaspian Dictatorship fell on September 15, 1918, when the Ottoman-Azerbaijani forces took control of Baku. = Path to Unified Armenia = On October 30, the Armistice of Moudros ended the hostilities in the Middle Eastern theatre between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies of World War I. It also concluded the Caucasus Campaign for the Ottoman Empire. By the end of the war, the Ottoman Empire, although it lost the Persian Campaign, Sinai and Palestine Campaign and Mesopotamian Campaign, it had re-captured all the territory which was lost to the Russians. At this point Ottomans finalized on December 5, 1917, the armistice of Erzincan, on March 3, 1918 Treaty of Brest- Litovsk, on March 14 Trabzon peace conference and on June 4, 1918, Treaty of Batum. In 1919, Avetis Aharonyan was the head of the Armenian delegation at the Paris Peace Conference with Boghos Nubar. In late 1919 Andranik led a delegation to the United States to lobby its support for a mandate for Armenia. He was accompanied by General Jaques Bagratuni, Captain Haig Bonapartian, and Lieutenant Ter-Pogossian. In Fresno he directed a campaign in which he raised $500,000 for the relief of Armenian war refugees. Avetis Aharonyan signed the Treaty of S√®vres formulating the \\"Wilsonian Armenia\\" in direct collaboration with the Armenian Diaspora. The Treaty of S√®vres was signed between the Allied and Associated Powers and Ottoman Empire at S√®vres, France on August 10, 1920. The treaty included a clause on Armenia: it made all parties signing the treaty recognize Armenia as a free and independent state. The drawing of definite borders was, however, left to President Woodrow Wilson and the United States State Department, and was only presented to Armenia on November 22. Wilsonian Armenia refers to the boundary configuration of the Armenian state in the Treaty of S√®vres, drawn by Woodrow Wilson.  Activities during Interwar period  = Territorial disputes of Armenia = On September 24 and the Turkish‚ÄìArmenian War began. Negotiations were then carried out between Karabekir and a peace delegation led by Alexander Khatisian in Alexandropol; although Karabekir‚Äôs terms were extremely harsh the Armenian delegation had little recourse but to agree to them. The Treaty of Alexandropol was thus signed on December 3, 1920, after the Armenian government had fallen to a concurrent Soviet invasion on December 2.Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, Vol. IV, pp. 394-396. Azerbaijan claimed most of the territory Armenia was sitting on, demanding all or most parts of the former Russian provinces of Elizavetpol, Tiflis, Yerevan, Kars and Batum.See Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, Vol. II, p. 192, map 4. Territorial clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan took place throughout 1919 and 1920, most notably in the regions of Nakhichevan, Karabakh and Syunik (Zangezur). In May 1919, Dro led an expeditionary unit that was successful in establishing Armenian administrative control in Nakhichevan Hovannisian. Republic of Armenia, Vol. I, pp. 243-247. = Sovietization & exile of Armenian leaders = However, despite ARF's tight grip on power Drastamat Kanayan (Ministry of Defense) and Aram Manukian (Ministry of Interior), the ARF was unable to stop the impending Communist invasion of the First Republic of Armenia from the north, which culminated with a Soviet takeover in 1920. There was also a large movement of Armenian communists who aided the Soviet control. The 11th Red Army began its virtually unopposed advance into Armenia on November 29, 1920. The actual transfer of power took place on December 2 in Yerevan. The Armenian leadership approved an ultimatum, presented to it by the Soviet plenipotentiary Boris Legran. Armenia decided to join the Soviet sphere. The ARF was banned, its leaders exiled and many of its members dispersed to other parts of the world. Daniel Bek-Pirumyan was arrested and executed by the Bolsheviks in Karakilisa in 1921. In 1937 during the Joseph Stalin's Great Purge against the military and other suspected enemies, his secret police arrested Movses Silikyan, Christophor Araratov, Dmitry Mirimanov, Aghasi Varosyan, Stepan Ohanesyan, Hakob Mkrtchyan, and Harutyun Hakobyan imprisoned and finally executed in Nork gorge. Aghbalyan moved to Lebanon, directed Nshan Palanjian seminarium in Beirut. The Treaty of Kars was signed on October 13, 1921, and ratified in Yerevan on September 11, 1922. Treaty established contemporary borders between Turkey and the South Caucasus states on the count of Armenian lands. Armenian Minister of Foreign Affairs Askanaz Mravian and Minister of Interior Poghos Makintsian signed the Treaty of Kars, which helped to conclude (for the moment) the territorial disputes originate after the Caucasus Campaign as a whole. = Cilicia and French Armenian Legion = In January 1920, Turkish National Movement advanced his troops into Marash where the Battle of Marash ensued against the French Armenian Legion. The battle resulted in the massacres of 5,000 ‚Äì 12,000 Armenians, spelling the end of the remaining Armenian population in the region. France disbanded the French Armenian Legion shortly after the war started. One of the Armenian Legion members, Sarkis Torossian, wrote in his diary that he suspected the French forces gave weapons and ammunition to the Kemalists to allow the French army safe passage out of Cilicia. The Cilicia Peace Treaty between France and the Turkish National Movement was signed on 9 March 1921. It was intended to end the Franco-Turkish war, but failed to do so and was replaced in October 1921 with the Treaty of Ankara. = Republic of Mountainous Armenia, 1922 = On 18 February 1921, the ARF led an anti-Soviet rebellion in Yerevan and seized power. The ARF controlled Yerevan and the surrounding regions for almost 42 days before being defeated by the numerically superior Red Army troops later in April 1921. The leaders of the rebellion then retreated into the Syunik region. On 26 April 1921, the 2nd Pan-Zangezurian congress, held in Tatev, announced the independence of the self-governing regions of Daralakyaz (Vayots Dzor), Zangezur, and Mountainous Artsakh, under the name of the Republic of Mountainous Armenia and later on 1 June 1921, it was renamed the Republic of Armenia.Mountainous Armenia After months of fierce battles with the Red Army, the Republic of Mountainous Armenia capitulated in July 1921 following Soviet Russia's promises to keep the mountainous region as a part of Soviet Armenia. After losing the battle, Garegin Nzhdeh, his soldiers, and many prominent Armenian intellectuals, including leaders of the first Independent Republic of Armenia, crossed the border into neighbouring Persian city of Tabriz = Operation Nemesis = Operation Nemesis was the ARF's code-name for a covert operation in the early 1920s to assassinate the Turkish planners of the Armenian Genocide. Those involved with the planning and execution of the operation (including Shahan Natalie and Soghomon Tehlirian) were survivors of genocidal massacres. The Operation, between 1920 and 1922, assassinated many significant political and military figures of the Ottoman Empire, the Internal Affairs Minister of Azerbaijan and some Armenians who were working against the Armenian cause.  Achievements of the movement  = Establishment of an Armenian State = The First Republic of Armenia was the first modern establishment of an Armenian state. The leaders of the government came from mainly the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and also other Armenian political parties who helped create the new republic. State had unquestionably Armenian color, as when it was declared out of 2,000,000 Armenian's (Russian) in the Caucasus, 1,300,000 (Russian) Armenians were to be found within the boundaries of the new Republic of Armenia, which also had 300,000 to 350,000 refugees that escaped from the Ottoman Empire. Added to this Armenian population were 350,000 to 400,000 people of other nationalities. There were 1,650,000 Armenians (both Russian, and Ottoman origin) of the 2,000,000 people within the borders of the new Republic which made clearly, uncontested, an Armenian state. Richard G. Hovannisian explains the conditions of the resistance: = Cultural heritage = There is a Fedayees museum in Yerevan named after General Andranik Ozanian. Armenian resistance has left a symbolic dish. The \\"Harissa (dish)\\" (): is generally served to commemorate the Musa Dagh resistance.  Timeline of the movement  The timeline covers the activities of ethnic Armenian citizens of the Ottoman Empire, Russian Empire and significant European cities which had significant Armenian diaspora, such as in France as early as the 1890s. The timeline has events formulated by Social Democrat Hunchakian Party, Armenakan, Armenian Revolutionary Federation, and Armenian Patriotic Society of Europe. The \\"liberation movement\\" as the term implies an \\"Armenian nationalistic movement aimed to \\"liberate\\" the Armenian people from the domination of Ottoman and Russian powers as explained under the \\"Russian Armenia\\" (1828‚Äì1918), \\"Armenians in the Ottoman Empire\\" (not the period (1453 to 1829) but (1930 -1922)) and also Armenian controlled (established or being part of) \\"Republic of Van\\" (1915-1918),\\"Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic\\" (1917-1918), \\"First Republic of Armenia\\", (1918‚Äì1922) and \\"Centrocaspian Dictatorship\\" (1918).

The final Liberator version contains some lyrical variations, such as the name of the pornographic actress Christy Canyon as opposed to newsreader Selina Scott in the 1983 version. A demo version of the original arrangement was finally released in 2015, as a bonus track on the deluxe edition of Junk Culture. Liberators title track was not completed in time for the album release. It was eventually included in the Souvenir 40th anniversary retrospective boxset in 2019, featuring on a CD of previously unreleased material. The track was first released in September on digital and streaming platforms ahead of the boxset. It was a song that Andy McCluskey had been trying to write for several years from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s. The title inspiration comes from his love of WWII aeroplanes. There were several demo versions recorded, with the one released in 2019 being as close as the song got to the intended sound. Reception Stephen Thomas Erlewine in AllMusic remarked: \\"While it is far from the experimental and edgy synth- pop that earned the group rave reviews in the early '80s, [Liberator] is an enjoyable, lightweight collection of appealing dance-pop.\\" Trouser Press wrote: \\"All those years spent in the company of keyboards evidently left [Andy McCluskey] fully able to make convincing percolating rhythms and layers of faux violins, and both get good use on what is a pretty stupid but diverting exercise.\\" The Electricity Club included Liberator in the list, \\"Some Not So Great Albums By Some Great Acts\\", but described \\"King of Stone\\" and \\"Christine\\" as \\"pure genius\\".\\"Some Not So Great Albums By Some Great Acts\\" .

He played first-class cricket for Derbyshire and Hampshire between 1967 and 1980. He also played football as an inside forward in the 1960s, notably with Rochdale. Stephenson was born in Derby. He was a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper, who played first-class cricket for Derbyshire between 1967 and 1968. He joined Hampshire for the 1969 season. Hampshire played steadily during 1969, finishing the season in fifth place, though the team found the following season hard-going and ended 1970 with just four victories under their belt. Stephenson continued to serve Hampshire through the inconsistent times of the mid-70s, the highlight being the team's second- ever victory in the County Championship in 1973. Stephenson remained a first- team choice through the late 1970s, and into the 1980 season, but he retired from first-class cricket after Hampshire's bottom-placed finish in that season's County Championship. Stephenson's sole first-class century came for Hampshire against Somerset in 1976. He was club captain during his penultimate season following the retirement of Richard Gilliat. Stephenson was also a professional footballer, playing for Derby County, Shrewsbury Town and Rochdale in the 1960s.

Riverhills is bounded to the west by the Brisbane River, to the south by Wolston Creek, and to the south-east by Wacol Station Road. The land use is predominantly residential. The terrain is hilly rising from below above sea level beside the river to over on the northern bank of Wolston Creek.  History  Flooding on Sumner Road, 13 January 2011 The western part of the original land holdings that became the Centenary Suburbs were part of the Wolston Estate, consisting of 54 farms on an area of 3000 acres, offered for auction at Centennial Hall, Brisbane, on 16 October 1901. Wolston Estate is the property of M. B. Goggs, whose father obtained the land forty years previously in the 1860s and after whom Goggs Road is named. Only three of the farms sold at the original auction. In 1879, the local government area of Yeerongpilly Division was created. In 1891, parts of Yeerongpilly Division were excised to create Sherwood Division becoming a Shire in 1903 which contained the area of the Wolston Estate. In 1925, the Shire of Sherwood was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane.

Christmas Village utilizes approximately one half million Christmas lights and other decorative effects in a presentation that has repeatedly been listed among the top tourist attractions in Pennsylvania and the top Christmas displays in the United States. The name Koziar rhymes with the English word composure. History The Christmas Village was originally known as Spring Lake Dairy Farm. When William M. Koziar began decorating the farm for Christmas in 1948, the display was created for the enjoyment of Koziar's wife, Grace, and their four children. It originally centered on the house and barn. Soon after, the display became more elaborate and incorporated the lake, walkways, trees, and fences. Over time, the private display became a popular local attraction known as the ‚ÄòChristmas House.‚Äô Traffic nearby would slow down because passersby would drive by slowly to get a chance to view the display. Eventually, visitors were admitted to the premises, and Koziar soon turned the wheat field into a parking space. The dairy farm remained active at first. The Koziars had to wait until the cows were milked before the family could turn on the lights because there was not enough power for the milking machines and the lights to operate simultaneously. Many of the dioramas were housed in old chicken coops, displaying toys and clothes of the Koziar children and grandchildren. In 2008, Koziar's Christmas Village celebrated its 60th anniversary. It remains a family-owned attraction, currently operated by the Koziar daughters while several employees are second and third generation associates. Display American flag light display Christmas Village features the elaborately illuminated home and barn of the Koziar family, as well as numerous smaller buildings. Upon entrance, visitors are greeted by costumed characters Rudolph, Frosty, and the Village's own Buddy the Bear. A marked pathway leads visitors among the illuminated buildings and other displays. Children may visit Santa Claus at his headquarters on Santa Claus Lane. There are several large dioramas depicting scenes such as Christmas Beneath the Sea, Christmas in the Jungle, Santa's Post Office, and Christmas in Other Lands. There are a number of displays featuring cut-out representations of characters from popular comic strips, animated films and fairy tales, as well as manger scenes, presentations of the biblical story of the Nativity, and tellings of seasonal stories such as A Christmas Carol and The Nutcracker. The Village also includes a recreation of the Valley Forge encampment and a G gauge outdoor train layout that encompasses most of the barnyard. The \\"Kissing Bridge\\" has been the site of several marriage proposals, engagements and weddings. In addition, there are several indoor features, including an extensive H0 scale model train layout and sales area, as well as shops selling souvenirs, Christmas decorations, refreshments, and other seasonal items. Perhaps the most dramatic feature of the Village is the first glimpse one sees of the display. Most visitors approach the property from the east, via Christmas Village Road. Being farm country the surrounding area is sparsely inhabited and, after dark, sparsely lit. The terrain blocks the view of the Village until the road crests a hill just a few hundred feet to the east of the display, at which point the entire Village is suddenly visible, reflected in the lake. As of late 2010 the Christmas Village website features a virtual recreation of this experience as a part of its home page. Operation Koziar's Christmas Village is a seasonal attraction. It is typically in operation from the first Saturday of November through the first Sunday in January. During the off-season most elements of the display are dismantled and stored in order to protect them from the elements and to allow for repairs and modifications. Reviews by many visitors on the Trip Advisor website warn of heavy traffic and waiting times of up to four hours to enter the park on the busiest Saturday nights. Awards Christmas Village has been named Best Outdoor Christmas Display in the World by Display World magazine. It has also been given the \\"Award of Excellence\\" by the Pennsylvania Travel Council as a top travel attraction in the state. A twilight image of Christmas Village was used as jacket art for the book Christmas in America: A Photographic Celebration of the Holiday Season by Peter Guttman. Christmas Village has been featured frequently by local media, as well as by national and international outlets such as Russia and Argentina.

Currently, it is part of Ghana. Historically, the Akyem were part of the Adansi Kingdom, which was the first nation to build buildings out of mud. They were therefore were named Adansi (builders). In the 14th century, the Ashanti Empire emerged, and under the leadership of King Osei Tutu, defeated the Adansi and annexed them into the Ashanti Empire. The three Akyem nations that were part of the Adansi Kingdom seceded and crossed the River Pra.  History  King Tutu I decided to pursue the Akyems across River Pra against the advice of Okomfo Anokye. While crossing the river with his army, he was shot by the Akyems in an ambush. He was killed and fell into the river. The Ashantis say \\"Meka Yawada\\" which means \\"I swear by Thursday\\" because the day the king died was on Thursday and the Akyems were known as \\"Abuakwanfo\\" or \\"Abuakwafo\\" (guerrilla fighters). The Ashantis retreated and this defeat created a taboo preventing any Ashanti King up to the time of Nana Prempeh I (in 1900) to cross the Pra to the south. After his death, his nephew King Opoku Ware I became the king of the Ashanti Empire and vowed to avenge his uncle's death. He restarted the war against the Akyems. The Akyems, knowing that the Ashantis would invade again, migrated southeastwards. Because of the travel, most of the Kotokus and some others settled in the present-day Ashanti Akyem region. The majority traveled until they met Akwamus, a powerful nation inhabiting and ruling the tribes from Asamankese to Nyanawase, which was then their capital and part of Akwapim. The Abuakwas fought the Akwamus and settled in the area of the Akwamus. The Abukawas made temporary capitals in several areas, including Praso, before settling at Pameng. In the reign of King Ofori Panin the capital was moved to Kyebirie. The Abuakwas fought few battles with their rival tribes and were an independent state until in 1852, the Abuakwas surrendered to the British Empire and they became a British administrative region.

The knot is placed at the top of a new mast with the mast projecting through the center of the knot. The loops of the knot are then used as anchor points for makeshift stays and shrouds. Usually small blocks of wood are affixed to, or a groove cut in, the new mast to prevent the knot from sliding downwards.Clifford W. Ashley, The Ashley Book of Knots (New York: Doubleday, 1944), 212. There is contention among knot researchers whether this supposed rigging knot can work as described. Due to a lack of hard historical evidence there is also uncertainty whether it was ever commonly used for rigging jury masts.Charles Hamel, \\"Investigations on the Jury Mast Knot\\" (URLs retrieved 2007-02-22) Variations There are three closely related variations of this knot. They differ based on the type of crossing, overhand or underhand, of the three initial loops and then whether the edges of each loop is positioned over or under the previous one. Although these knots are tied in the bight, for the purposes of description the left side will be considered the standing part. If all the crossings and overlays are reversed, or the right side is taken as the standing part, a mirror image of the knot will result. =#1167= This variation grips the mast best in the absence of other means to prevent the knot from sliding downwards. The pattern of this variation, from the left, is: under-under-under/over-over. leftleft =#1168= This variation is the simplest of the three in structure (though not in tying) and lends itself to being reinforced by tying a reef knot with the two free ends.

It was named after a bFM New Zealand music radio show that has been running since 1987. Unlike the previous Freak the Sheep compilation which focused on Auckland bands, this compilation had bands from around the country. The concept was similar to the 1986 National Student Radio Weird Culture Weird Custom compilation LP, which launched the careers of Cassandra's Ears and the Puddle. At the time of release it was very difficult for uncommercial bands to release music, and most bands on the compilation had only self-released cassettes that were only available in their own towns. The Cyclops and the Axel Grinders had previous releases on international labels, but this was their first release in their own country. It was the first release from Into The Void, a Christchurch band that performed for several decades. It was released by the Flying Nun label in 1992 on cassette and CD.

Its waters are impounded by Grizzly Valley Dam, which was completed in 1966. The lake is named for Lester T. Davis (1906-1952). Hydrology The lake discharges into Big Grizzly Creek, a tributary of the Middle Fork Feather River. Grizzly Valley Dam Grizzly Valley Dam is an earth-and-rock dam long and high, with of freeboard. The California Department of Water Resources owns the dam. Recreation Located in Plumas National Forest, Lake Davis is the centerpiece of the Lake Davis Recreation Area, which supports boating, campground camping, cross-country skiing, fishing, hunting, mountain biking, picnicking, snowmobiling, swimming, and wildlife viewing. Northern pike During 1996-97 Lake Davis was in the national spotlight due to controversy over northern pike and the possibility of poisoning the lake. Following an explosion of the pike population, and the California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) decided to treat the reservoir with rotenone, a naturally occurring poison deadly to gilled creatures. After the first attempt failed to eradicate the pike and the population rebounded, the DFG again utilized rotenone in September 2007, after lowering the water level. DFG's justification for the action was their concern that pike might escape the lake and enter the Sacramento River system, potentially harming native anadromous fish species such as steelhead and salmon. The effort was controversial because pike are popular gamefish and considerable effort had already been spent on unsuccessful attempts to rid the lake of pike using explosives, nets, shocking, and poison. Since the 2007 treatment, there have been no confirmed cases of northern pike in the lake.

History After a call for volunteers in July 1862 by Andrew Curtin, Governor of Pennsylvania, the 134th Regiment was mustered in for nine months of service. The companies were from the following counties: * Field Staff Muster Roll * Company A ‚Äì Lawrence County Muster Roll * Company B ‚Äì Lawrence County Muster Roll * Company C ‚Äì Butler County Muster Roll * Company D ‚Äì Lawrence County Muster Roll * Company E ‚Äì Beaver County Muster Roll * Company F ‚Äì Butler County Muster Roll * Company G ‚Äì Butler County Muster Roll * Company H ‚Äì Lawrence County Muster Roll * Company I ‚Äì Beaver County Muster Roll * Company K ‚Äì Butler County Muster Roll Most of the men had no prior military service. Some had served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, but many were fresh recruits. After being trained at Camp Curtin, they were moved to Washington D.C. on August 20, 1862, following the Confederate advance on the capital during the Northern Virginia Campaign. After one day at Washington, they were moved to Arlington Heights, where they engaged in drill and other duties. They joined a brigade with the 91st, 126th, and 129th Pennsylvania regiments, under the command of General Erastus B. Tyler. It was here that the organization of the regiment was completed. For the field officers, Matthew Quay of Beaver County was commissioned as colonel, Edward O'Brien of Lawrence County as lieutenant colonel, and John M. Thompson of Butler County as major. On August 30, the 134th marched towards Manassas, Virginia, but arrived too late to participate in the Second Battle of Bull Run. The men returned to camp and were put in the defenses. On September 13, Tyler's Brigade, as part of the Third Division, V Corps, marched towards South Mountain in central Maryland. It arrived near Sharpsburg, Maryland, on the 18th, but had arrived too late to participate in the Battle of Antietam. During the night of the 18th, the Confederate army withdrew into Virginia. Until September 30, the regiment remained near Sharpsburg and drilled. During this time, Colonel Quay was caught typhoid fever and O'Brien took command. In November, the regiment moved to Fredericksburg, Virginia, where it went into camp. In early December, Quay was forced to resign due to his disease and O'Brien was promoted to colonel, Thompson to lieutenant colonel, and Captain William H. Shaw to major. The 134th fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, losing 14 killed, 106 wounded, and 19 missing. Despite his illness, Quay volunteered to serve as an aide to General Tyler throughout the battle, for which he would receive a Medal of Honor in 1888. The regiment fought in the Battle of Chancellorsville from May 1 to 3 1863, on the left flank of the Union army. Total casualties were 48 men killed, wounded, and missing. The enlistments of the men expired soon after the battle, and the 134th was mustered out in Harrisburg on May 26, 1863. Service *Organized at Camp Curtin. *Sent to Washington, D.C.

The New York Times in 2002 described Hagstrom's Five Borough Atlas as New York City's \\"map of record\\" for the previous 60 years. With the rise of GPS navigation and other electronic maps in the early 2000s, the printed-map business shrank to a fraction of its former size, undergoing extensive consolidation. In 2009, the Maspeth headquarters were shut down; production has since moved to Deland, Florida. History Hagstrom Maps began in 1916Note: the archived Hagstrom site gives the year as 1816, but several other sources, including maps put out by Hagstrom, say 1916. when Andrew Hagstrom, a Swedish immigrant, produced a map to help customers locate his newly opened drafting business in lower Manhattan. The map featured exaggeratedly wide streets that offered abundant room for clear labeling of addresses, transportation, and other terrain features. Hagstrom began selling the map, soon expanding it to cover all of Manhattan, then all of New York City, then its outlying regions, eventually offering over 100 maps. The New York City Subway used a Hagstrom design for its official subway maps during the 1940s and up to 1958. The widened-street style was a hallmark of Hagstrom's product line; although it added clarity in navigation and labeling, the widened streets borrowed their space from the surrounding blocks, in some cases reducing them to slivers; for instance, the Flatiron Building appeared as \\"a speck where Broadway and Fifth Avenue converge\\". Hagstrom also produced the \\"redlining\\" maps of New York City in 1938.http://planyourcity.net/2014/04/28/brooklyns-1938-redline-map HOLC Maps From 1941 to 2002, all of Hagstrom's New York City maps were based on a single master map that was updated by hand. This produced a number of other visual artifacts; new streets and neighborhoods had to be shoehorned into layouts designed around previously existing features. A number of quirky and archaic labels also remained, such as \\"The Shed\\", a large disused building on Pier 42 on the East River, and Mussel Island, a long-gone feature of Newtown Creek. In 2002, Hagstrom switched to all-digital master maps using more conventional layouts and labels. In its heyday, the company's lineup included atlases, borough maps, maps of the Tri-State Region and detailed and quite colorful maps of midtown Manhattan. The midtown maps, which detailed most of the significant buildings and businesses (Rockefeller Center, Pennsylvania Station, Saks Fifth Avenue, etc.) show the changing face of the city's business district, and have started to draw the attention of map collectors. In 1968, Hagstrom was acquired by Macmillan Publishers (United States); Macmillan sold Hagstrom to the Langenscheidt publishing group in 1981. In 2010, Kappa Publishing Group acquired the Hagstrom brand from Langenscheidt after the latter decided to sell off its U.S. operations. The Hagstrom Map Company Publication Code During the 1970s and 1980s, Hagstrom's catalog included maps of a number of cities beyond the New York area, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, and Philadelphia. Most of these publications were out of print by the late 1990s. Hagstrom had three retail stores; one in lower Manhattan, one in midtown, and one in Washington, D.C.; the last of which closed in 2010.

Renowned as a \\"versifier\\", Montague is best known for his column \\"More Truth Than Poetry\\", which was published in a wide number of newspapers for nearly 25 years.\\"James Montague, Versifier, Is Dead\\", The New York Times, December 17, 1941 Montague's journalism career began in 1896 at The Oregonian, where he started as a copy boy. He was soon promoted to reporter and eventually took over the column \\"Slings and Arrows\\".James J. Montague, collected papers, Ithaca, New York In 1902 he was hired by William Randolph Hearst to work at the New York American and New York Evening Journal, where he debuted \\"More Truth Than Poetry\\". Montague wrote the column six days a week, in addition to articles on topics such as politics, theater and sports. In 1919 he moved to the New York World, which described him as \\"the most widely circulated poet in the United States.\\"\\" 'Jimmy' Montague, Aladdin of the Newspaper Poets,\\" New York World, June 15, 1919 Later in Montague's career, his whimsical pieces were often carried by the Bell Syndicate. Early life James Jackson Montague was born in Mason City, Iowa on April 16, 1873, the sixth child and third son of John Vose Wood Montague and Martha Washington Jackson. The couple lost their first daughter and son in early childhood; four children survived, including James, his brother Richard, and his sisters Carrie and Jane.Richard C. Montague, correspondence, August 12, 2011 In Mason City the father worked as a cashier of the First National Bank until it began to lose money in the recession of 1887. The family then moved to Portland, Oregon, where the father went into the insurance business. James J. Montague entered high school there, finishing in two years so he could go to work to help support the family. Consequently he never attended university, but he made up for his lack of formal education through a love of literature. In the memoir Memory Street, his son Richard wrote: \\"He was an omnivorous reader, especially of the works of Shakespeare, Conrad, Mark Twain, O. Henry, Shelley, Keats, Coleridge, Byron [and] Burns\\"Memory Street, p. 7 Montague first worked at lumber mill and later a fish-freezing plant. When he heard there was an opening for an office boy at the Portland Oregonian, he was sufficiently interested in becoming a journalist that he offered to initially work without pay. In 1896, at age 23, he was hired as a \\"cub\\" reporter at a salary of $10 a week. Soon after, the writer of an Oregonian column titled \\"Slings and Arrows\\" died, and Montague was offered the opportunity to take it over. His version of the column, which often included comic verse, was considered \\"an immediate success.\\"Memory Street, p. 5 In 1898, at age 25, Montague married Helen L. Hageny of Portland, Oregon. Their first child, Richard, was born in 1900. Two years later Montague's writing attracted the attention of publisher William Randolph Hearst through New York Evening Journal cartoonist Homer Davenport, who had worked at the Oregonian before moving to New York in 1895. Through an agent, Hearst offered Montague a position in New York City but he declined, preferring to remain in Portland. Hearst was insistent, however, and the writer named what he thought was a prohibitive price, $60 a week ‚Äî double his salary at the time ‚Äî and was \\"flabbergasted\\" when it was accepted. New York In 1902, Montague, his wife, and son moved to New York, where he began work for Hearst. His daughter Doris, born that year, stayed behind with Montague's mother, who later followed. Initially, the family lived in a Manhattan boardinghouse, then moved to number of rented houses in New RochelleMemory Street, p. 24 where their second son, James Lee Montague, was born. They finally built their own house at 204 Drake Avenue, moving in around 1904.Richard C. Montague, interview, January 13, 2012 In New York, Montague's work appeared in both the New York American and New York Evening Journal. He produced a poetry column six times a week, in addition to writing a wide range of articles on politics, books, and theater. During his working life, he compiled many binders of his work, of which six from the 1900s survive. Of these, the vast majority are his poetry column. The New York Times referred to Montague as a \\"twentieth-century bard,\\" while W.O. McGeehan, then editor of the New York Herald Tribune, said he \\"took the passing laughter of the day and sent it singing through a typewriter to the presses so that millions could catch its rhythm and understand.\\" To Montague's dislike, his work was occasionally confused with that of Edgar Guest or James Whitcomb Riley, both of whom were also popular during the same period. While Montague was best known as the writer of \\"More Truth than Poetry,\\" he also served as an editor at the Hearst papers when required. One of his tasks was completing an \\"autobiography\\" of Buffalo Bill Cody, The Great West That Was: \\"Buffalo Bill's\\" Life Story, which was serialized in Hearst's International Magazine from August 1916 to July 1917.The Lives and Legends of Buffalo Bill Don Russell, University of Oklahoma Press, 1979, p. 276 During the time Montague was working on the manuscript, Cody was a frequent visitor to the writer's New Rochelle home, \\"usually just in time for lunch or dinner.\\"Memory Street, p. 117 This friendliness ended when an installment of the autobiography characterized Wild Bill Hickok as a \\"bandit,\\" something Cody hadn't approved of and didn't appreciate. As Montague's son Richard wrote in his memoir: > \\"Father claimed that [Cody had] re-armed himself with his old six guns and > was stalking our sire with intent to kill. For several weeks after that we > kids lived in delicious dread half-believing that father was in deadly > danger. When we went out on a walk with him he'd send us on ahead to look > around corners and behind trees to see if Bill Cody was waiting in ambush. > The fact that he wasn't only made it more likely that he would be there next > time. But he never was.\\"Memory Street, p. 118 By this time the circulation wars between the Hearst and Pulitzer papers were past their \\"yellow journalism\\" zenith of the late 1800s, but the two continued to battle for market share and talent. Montague had originally been recruited by Hearst in 1902, and now The World came calling. On June 15, 1919, the paper announced that Montague would join them, bringing with him his poetry column. In the article, Montague was referred to as the \\"Aladdin of the Newspaper Poets\\" and a \\"successor to James Whitcomb Riley,\\" a characterization he may not have appreciated. While compensation may have played a role in the move, according to his son, more personal factors were also involved: > \\"[Montague] had had enough of Hearst. In quitting, he said, he felt he had > taken a Turkish bath and got clean again. He admired the publisher's > brilliance, capricious generosity and many worthy activities, but he didn't > like his persistent distortion of the news and lack of principles. 'He could > have been a great man,' father told me once. 'The only thing he lacked was > character.' \\"Memory Street, p. 168 Hearst never forgave Montague for moving to the World, yet continued to try to persuade him to return. Years later the publisher met him in the street and asked when he would come back. \\"Never,\\" Montague said. \\"Yes, you will,\\" Hearst replied. \\"Hunger will drive you back.\\" The year after Montague left Hearst, a collection of \\"More Truth than Poetry\\" columns was published by the George H. Doran Company. More Truth than Poetry, George H. Doran Company, 1920, p. vii The book ran 160 pages with a preface by Irvin S. Cobb, and included classic poems such as \\"The Sleepytown Express,\\" More Truth than Poetry, p. 17 \\"The Ouija Board\\" More Truth than Poetry, p. 137 and \\"The Vamp Passes.\\" More Truth than Poetry, p. 151 Later in Montague's career, he joined the Bell Syndicate, working out of the editorial room of the New York Herald Tribune. The syndicate distributed both Montague's poems and light fiction pieces, all under his own copyright. One example is \\"No Appreciation for This Bard,\\" about an out-of-work press agent, which was published in the Washington Post of the January 27, 1924. According to the New York Times, Montague wrote six poetry columns a week for nearly 25 years; at this rate, he produced more than 7,500 examples of \\"More Truth Than Poetry\\" over his career. Politics In addition to writing \\"More Truth Than Poetry,\\" Montague was keenly interested in the politics of his day. He covered New York City and New York State events for many years, including the 1913 impeachment trial of Governor William Sulzer \\"Glynn and Sulzer Claim to Be Chief\\" James J. Montague, Evening Independent, August 22, 1913, p. 5. Accessed January 14, 2012 and the 1915 libel case between Albany Times-Union owner and publisher William Barnes Jr., and former President Theodore Roosevelt.\\"Barnes-Roosevelt Verdict This Week\\" New York Times, May 16, 1915. Accessed January 14, 2012\\"Theodore Roosevelt and the Barnes Libel Case: A Reappraisal\\" John Robert Greene, Presidential Studies Quarterly, Winter 1989. Accessed January 14, 2012 Because Montague worked for Hearst, who had no liking of Roosevelt, he had to exercise caution when covering the trial. In Eugene Thwing's 1919 book The Life and Meaning of Theodore Roosevelt, the author wrote: > \\"At the Barnes-Roosevelt libel trial in Syracuse I came across James J. > Montague, a hardened reporter on a highly anti-Roosevelt newspaper, walking > up and down and cursing. I asked him what moved him to these expletives. > 'Roosevelt, damn him,' said Montague; 'I can't keep hating him if I get > anywhere within twenty feet of him, and I'm always accidentally doing it. > He's spoiling my story.' \\"The Life and Meaning of Theodore Roosevelt, > Current Literature Publishing Company, 1919, p. 311 Working for Hearst's publications and wire service, Montague covered the national political conventions of 1912 and 1916. Despite his reputation as a \\"hardened reporter,\\" Montague had friends in all the political parties of his day ‚Äî Democratic, Republican, Bull Moose, Socialist and Farmer Labor. \\"Although Hearst's editorials bitterly denounced most of the principals in these organizations from time to time, the victims never held it against [Montague].\\"Memory Street, p. 21 After World War I, Montague served as an international correspondent for the Hearst publications when required. In 1918 he covered the armistice with Germany and the following year he attended the Paris Peace Conference. In his first cable, dated January 17, 1919, Montague signaled that the authorities appeared ready to exclude all newspaper representatives from the conference. \\"America has come here seeking nothing but an open agreement,\\" Montague wrote. \\"If she is to persuaded to play the European game of secret and underground bickering she is certain to lose not only her initial advantage but all her objectives.\\"Memory Street, p. 166 Other, less serious events at the conference also contributed to the legend of his having been the \\"star\\" of the press corps: > \\"[After the conference] a group of American correspondents, including Mr. > Montague, shared a luxurious dinner, featured by a tremendous turkey. About > to leave for England, Mr. Montague remarked that since it might be a long > time before they had another such meal it might be worth while taking the > remains of the turkey along. But when they arrived they were rushed to > Buckingham Palace and the man with the turkey in the shoebox still had it > under his arm. Over the protests of an equerry, he ‚Äî Montague ‚Äî is alleged > to have still carried the box when presented to His Majesty George V. Having jumped to Pulitzer's New York World in 1919, the following year Montague covered the U.S. presidential election for them. \\"A big convention without 'Jimmy' Montague at the press table would seem scarcely legal,\\" the World magazine wrote in 1919. Montague also covered the 1924 conventions and election, which was notable for the split within the Democratic Party. In it, front-runners William Gibbs McAdoo and Al Smith fought a war of attrition until, 103 ballots later, John W. Davis was selected as the compromise candidate. Filing daily under the byline \\"the Looker-On,\\" Montague chronicled the battle with stories such as \\"16 Candidates Trying to Pick Least Unpopular: Like So Many Jack Horners, They Dig Their Thumbs Into Convention Pie Containing One Plum.\\" While Montague was never interested in personally entering politics, he occasionally provided assistance to friends in their campaigns. He had known Franklin Delano Roosevelt since he was a New York state senator in 1910, and in those days \\"often helped the young legislator with his speeches and with political advice.\\"Memory Street, p. 275 He provided similar assistance to Al Smith at various times during his campaigns for New York State governor.Memory Street, p. 22 In 1932 he traveled with William J. Donovan as an \\"adviser and campaign critic\\" when he was running for governor of New York. Personal life Members of the Knot-Very Social and Musical Frat prepare to play golf in the 1910s. Among them is James J. Montague, second from left. Montague came to golf relatively late in life but showed a talent for the game. A member of the New York Athletic Club, he initially played on public links on Pelham Bay Park.Memory Street, p. 194 According to his friend and fellow journalist Grantland Rice, Montague was eventually so good that he could \\"shoot par with hoes, rakes, and shovels.\\" How You Played the Game: The Life of Grantland Rice William Arthur Harper, University of Missouri, 1999, p. 315 Together with Montague, New York theater impresario John Golden organized the \\"Knot-Very Social and Musical Frat.\\" The organization had only four other members: Newspaperman and publisher John Neville Wheeler, sports journalist and writer Ring Lardner, American Magazine editor John Sidall, and Grantland Rice. For the members, none of whom had attended college, the organization was miniature fraternity, as much social as athletic.Memory Street, p. 196 According to Rice's biographer William Arthur Harper, \\"The club got its name from Ring Lardner's habit of commenting on another's tee shot; when one of them would hit a drive, another would say cheerfully, 'Nice shot, old boy.' 'Not very,' Ring Lardner would respond, drolly.\\" How You Played the Game: The Life of Grantland Rice p. 315 The club's letterhead, designed by Golden, featured a knotted rope above the names of its members, the largest being that of its president, Montague. In 1924 artist Lucius Wolcott Hitchcock introduced Montague to illustrator Coles Phillips, also a resident of New Rochelle. A noted pigeon fancier, Phillips suggested to Montague that they could make a substantial amount of money raising and selling squabs to restaurants and hotels. The breed chosen was the red carneau. Together they bought four acres of land on Webster Avenue near the Wykagyl Country Club, built a row of pigeon houses and installed 4,000 birds. The result, called the Silver Ring Squab Farm, had set the two back a total of $15,000.Memory Street, p. 247.\\"Cole Phillips, Artist, Is Dead\\" Spokesman Review, June 14, 1927, p. 2 Their dreams of pigeon-born wealth went anything but smoothly, however: A local mobster reputedly demanded a portion of the proceeds, while hotels had a habit of canceling orders. Friends were interested, but more in eating squab than paying for them. Not long after, Phillips contracted tuberculosis, and he and his wife left for Europe. Now sole manager of the farm, Montague put in thousands more to keep it afloat. Salvation came in the form of Westchester County, which wanted to buy the land to construct the Hutchinson River Parkway. Phillips later returned from Europe seemingly healthy, but died in 1927 at age 47.Time, \\"Milestones\\", June 27, 1927 Death While Montague once seemed tireless, his health began to fail in the 1930s. His last daily poem appeared in the New York Herald Tribune on May 16, 1936. \\"When he retired, the newspaper used free-lance verse rather than attempt to find a permanent successor\\", wrote The New York Times. His wife, Helen, died in January 1937 after nearly 40 years of marriage. As his health worsened, Montague went to the McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. He died there on December 16, 1941, survived by his two sons and daughter as well as seven grandchildren. Bibliography * More Truth than Poetry, George H. Doran Company, 1920. 160 pages.

History Although the jumping jack is popularly thought of as a European toy, ivory dancer figures made to spin by pulling their strings, which were found at the archaeological site El Lisht and date back to ancient Egyptian times, are considered to be among the earliest forms of this family of mechanical toys.

The original design was commissioned by Admiral Aube, commenced by Dupuy de L√¥me before his death and completed by Gustave Z√©d√© before his. Construction work then fell to Romazotti. The keel was laid on 20 April 1887 at Mourillon Arsenal at Toulon operated by La Soci√©t√© des Forges et chantiers, of which company Z√©d√© was a director. Trials began on 17 November 1888.Gymnote; ONI memorandum 1901. Krebs at rbmn.free.fr =Control gear= The boat was designed to operate underwater with a small positive buoyancy, so that without power and rudders driving it downwards it would tend to float to the surface. There were three ballast tanks, one in the centre and one either end. water could be ejected either using compressed air or electrical pumps. Continuous adjustment was needed during a dive. It was originally equipped only with a stern rudder, which gave poor control. At speeds greater than the boat would become unstable. At this speed the boat would be angled down 3-5¬∞ to maintain depth, so that the bow would be lower than the stern. Further rudders were added at the centre of the boat in 1893, which as well as improving stability meant that she remained more level as it dived. =Motor= The original sixteen pole electric motor designed by Captain Krebs to develop at 200V and 200A was constructed at the Societe des Forges et Chantiers at Le Havre, was 1 metre in diameter and weighed 2 tonnes. It was connected directly to the propellor which rotated at 250 rpm. The motor was fitted with two sets of brushes, one for forward and one reverse motion. Once installed it was found that the rear bearing was inaccessible and could not be repaired with the motor installed. It was difficult to inspect the armature or repair damage to the insulation. The motor was not designed to come to an immediate halt when power was disconnected, but instead would freewheel to a halt relatively slowly. Reverse power could not be applied until it had stopped moving, so it was not possible to immediately reverse the propeller in case of emergency. The motor proved so problematic that it was replaced with a smaller but more powerful Sautter-Harl√© motor. =Batteries= The boat was originally fitted with 540 Lalande-Chaperon alkaline cells which used Zinc and copper oxide electrodes with potassium hydroxide electrolyte, manufactured by Coumelin, Desmazures et Baillache. These were located towards the bow of the ship arranged into six banks of 45 parallel paired cells connected in series. To vary the speed, banks could be connected in different combinations, 6 banks in series giving 150 V and 8 knots, 3 banks in series in parallel with the other 3 in series giving 114 V and 7 knots, 2 banks in series paralleled 3 times giving 84 V and 5.5 knots, all 6 banks in parallel giving 45 V and 6 knots. A bank was capable of delivering a maximum of 166 amps. The whole array weighed eleven tons. A new battery was installed in 1891 using a Laurent-Cely sulphuric acid design having 205 individual 30 kg assemblies of five plates each. Again these were arranged into six banks, now each having 17 parallel pairs of batteries connected in series. At range was , at , . Another battery was installed in 1897. =Hull= The hull was made of 6 mm steel at the centre, tapering to 4 mm at either end with a circular cross section. Internally it was coated with coal tar to provide protection from spilled battery acid. The hull was supported by 31 circular frames with additional longitudinal bracing. =Navigation equipment= The boat was fitted with a periscope, but this proved unsatisfactory and its use was abandoned. Diving was delayed by the need to fix or stow the periscope and water seals proved to be unreliable and on a couple of occasions led to dangerous flooding. A small conning tower was added in 1898. The boats had a compass and gyroscope although these were not entirely reliable. The ship was equipped with two 14-inch torpedo tubes. History Gymnote was damaged on 5 March 1907 when she ran aground. The boat was drydocked but a hatch was left open while the dock was being filled, allowing her to flood and sink on 19 June 1907.Anonymous, \\"Torpedo Boat Sunk,\\" Poverty Bay Herald, Volume XXXIV, Issue 11045, 10 August 1907. Repairs were considered too expensive so she was sold for scrap in 1911.

He was a standout Harlon Hill Trophy winner in 2000 and 2001 while playing for Valdosta State University, and was signed as an undrafted free agent in 2002 by the Atlanta Falcons. College career =University of Kentucky= At Kentucky, Bonner was the backup quarterback behind eventual #1 overall NFL draft pick Tim Couch during the 1998 season in which the Wildcats ended up in the Outback Bowl after winning seven games. Couch went to the NFL after his junior season and Bonner became the starting quarterback in 1999. In 1999, Bonner started all 12 games and led the Southeastern Conference in pass efficiency, total offense, and passing yards per game. He led Kentucky to six wins (including victories over Louisiana State University and the University of Arkansas) and a close loss in the Music City Bowl. After head coach Hal Mumme announced that freshman Jared Lorenzen would be the starting quarterback for the 2000 season, Bonner transferred to Valdosta State University. Bonner lists his most memorable collegiate moment as defeating Vanderbilt while playing for UK to become bowl eligible. =Valdosta State University= Bonner enjoyed a stellar career in his two years at Valdosta State, during which he twice earned both the 2000 and 2001 Harlon Hill Trophies as the top Division II player in the nation. The back-to-back Harlon Hill Trophies made Bonner just one of three players in the 27-year history of the award to win the honor more than once. As a junior, he passed for 4,126 yards and 55 touchdowns while completing 71.9 percent of his passes. He led the nation in total offense, touchdown passes, passing yards and pass completions while leading VSU to a 10-2 record. He was a three-time Gulf South Conference Player of the Week and three-time Division II National Player of the Week and went on to earn first- team All-GSC and GSC Co-Offensive Player of the Year before also becoming a consensus All-American.As a senior, Bonner threw for 4,037 yards and 52 touchdowns while leading VSU to a perfect 11-0 regular season and the first No. 1 ranking in school history. He was the GSC Offensive Player of the Year for the second straight season and accounted for eight touchdowns in a game against Delta State, throwing for six and running for two more scores. He was named All-American by Daktronics, D2Football.com and Don Hansen at the conclusion of the season. In his two seasons at Valdosta State, Bonner completed 649-of-913 pass and threw for 8,163 yards. He tossed 107 touchdowns against just 22 interceptions and led VSU to playoff appearances both years. He currently holds the Blazer score record for passing yards in a game, touchdowns thrown in a game, total offense in a game, touchdowns responsible for in a game, yards per game in a season, total offense in a season and touchdowns responsible for in a season. He is third overall in career passing yards and second in both career touchdowns and total offense. Professional career =Atlanta Falcons= He signed with the Falcons on March 19, 2002 but never saw regular season action. =Lexington Horsemen= Bonner became the quarterback of the Horsemen under first year head coach Tony Franklin, who was previously an offensive assistant at the University of Kentucky before Bonner left the team. Bonner was named Atlantic Conference Offensive Most Valuable Player in 2003, finishing the season by completing 297 of his 450 pass attempts. Threw for 2,833 yards, 63 touchdowns and 18 interceptions. Finished second in the league in pass rating (109.1), third in total offense (2,884 total yards), third in passing yards (202.4 per game) and third in touchdown passes (63).

In 2004, Bonner led the Horsemen to the national championship, He threw for 2,695 yards and 72 touchdowns during the 2004 regular season. Bonner's 72 touchdowns rank as a league best in 2004. He also compiled a quarterback rating of 108.54, which also ranked first. Completed 18-of-28 passes in the championship game vs. the Sioux Falls Storm for 193 yards and five touchdowns. After a successful career on the field Bonner joined the front office of the Horsemen working under Andy Raaker as the General Manager. In this position he would be very helpful in continuing the dominance that had been started by Raaker. =Awards and honors= * Harlon Hill Trophy (2000) * Harlon Hill Trophy (2001) * National Indoor Football Championship (2004) * Division II Football Hall of Fame member (2013) References External links * Dusty Bonner Article @ www.oursportscentral.com Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Atlanta Falcons players Category:Kentucky Wildcats football players Category:Lexington Horsemen players Category:Valdosta State Blazers football players Category:People from Valdosta, Georgia Category:Players of American football from Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Dusty Bonner"},{"id":"7980400","text":"right East End East End District management offices East End Houston, managed by the East End District (EED), is a district in eastern Houston, Texas, United States, located between the eastern edge of downtown to the Port of Houston and South to Hobby Airport. The District is home to Houston's early history and industry and is the site of Harrisburg, the seat of government for the Republic of Texas in 1836. East End Houston consists of many different ethnic groups, including Hispanic, Asian, White, and African American. Latinos make up more than half of the 100,512 residents, The area includes two of Houston's oldest Hispanic neighborhoods, Magnolia Park and Second Ward. History Fire Station 18, 1976 East End Houston is bounded on the west by downtown Houston and on the east by the Port of Houston. Buffalo Bayou flows past the site of Harrisburg, an early Texas trading post and seat of government for the Republic of Texas in 1836. Founded by John Harris, for whom Harris County is named, Harrisburg was initially considered by the Allen brothers for the initial development of Houston. East End Houston was a primary area for relocation for Germans, Italians and Mexican Americans that settled in areas near the port of Houston. Second Ward and Magnolia Park, in the district, are two of Houston's oldest Hispanic neighborhoods. The Eastwood subdivision, established in 1913, is considered one of the first master- planned communities in Houston. Many well-known Houstonians including Howard Hughes lived in Eastwood as children. The District has become popular among those who restore many of its vintage homes. In the mid-to-late 2000s upper middle class residents moved into East End Houston to take advantage of houses that are less expensive than west side houses.Sarnoff, Nancy. \\"Housing buzz fuels move to East End.\\" Houston Chronicle.

While in the State Assembly, Barry served on the Appropriations Committee, the Joint Appropriations Committee, the Agriculture and Environment Committee and several special committees. As New Jersey's Director of Consumer Affairs, Barry's accomplishments included implementation of the Automobile Lemon Law and the Plain Language Law, restructuring the Bureau of Securities, winning more than six million dollars for New Jersey consumers in a defective transmission case and the establishment of an auto repair fraud unit. He served a term as President of the National Association of Consumer Agency Administrators and President of the National Coalition for Consumer Education. Later life Following positions at CNBC, Strategic Relations and Ned Ward Realtors, Barry moved on to a position as Broker/Manager of the New Vernon office of Weichert, Realtors \\"Capital Properties & Estates.\\" In addition to his position at Weichert, Realtors, Barry is a member and former Chairman of the Morris County Municipal Utilities Authority (MCMUA), Trustee and President of the Washington Association of New Jersey (WANJ) and the longtime President of the Harding Township Republican Club. Barry sought a return to the State Legislature in 2003 in two separate instances. In February when the local Republican county committees of the 21st Legislative District voted on a replacement for Assemblyman Thomas Kean Jr. who had been appointed to the State Senate, Barry came in second place behind Jon Bramnick in the vote for the remainder of Kean's term in the Assembly. In the regular June primary election, he came in behind incumbents Eric Munoz and Bramnick and two other candidates finishing in last place with 8 percent of the vote. He currently resides in the New Vernon section of Harding Township, New Jersey with his wife Leslie Breuninger and two children. References External links *James J.

Background and early life He was born in Montevideo to parents who moved to Buenos Aires when he was four years old, and he eventually adopted Argentine citizenship. His Spanish parents noticed his musical predisposition and tried to encourage it by sending him to violin and piano classes. He abandoned his studies, however, and entered the work force, first in a bookshop, until 1892, and later in the office of the Director of the San Mart√≠n Theatre for a period of 15 years. He began composing tango pieces during this interim. His first success was La morocha, which sold 280,000 copies following its 1905 recording, and was one of the first tango songs known outside Argentina. The wife of noted Parisian tenor Jean de Reszke invited Saborido to perform for high society audiences, and Saborido came into demand as a tango dance instructor. He returned to Buenos Aires following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and became a public administration employee. He married Urbana Ruiz and settled the residential Villa Devoto section of Buenos Aires (a daughter, Rosario, became the namesake for his last composition). Saborido made a last public appearance as a performer on the radio, in 1932, and he died at his desk at the War Ministry in Buenos Aires, on September 19, 1941.

Career At Kimball High School, Brad Havens wore No. 26 and played for Coach Frank Clouser at Royal Oak Kimball High School. Havens threw a no-hitter in the 1977 district championship for Kimball, which went to four Class A title games in 10 years from 1971 to 1980. Havens formed a tough one-two left-handed pitching punch with fellow Kimball hurler Steve Manderfield during his years on the varsity at Kimball. Havens was selected in the 8th round by the California Angels and Manderfield was chosen by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 12th round of the 1977 Major League baseball amateur draft. Havens was later acquired by the Minnesota Twins (along with outfielder Ken Landreaux, catcher/first baseman Dave Engle, and right-handed pitcher Paul Hartzell) in exchange for Rod Carew. He made his major league debut with the Twins at Tiger Stadium, just three weeks before the 1981 players' strike, and finished 9th in voting for 1981 American League Rookie of the Year for having a 3‚Äì6 Win-Loss record, 14 Games, 12 Games Started, 1 Complete Game, 1 Shutout, 1 Game Finished, 78 Innings Pitched, 76 Hits Allowed, 33 Runs Allowed, 31 Earned Runs Allowed, 6 Home Runs Allowed, 24 Walks Allowed, 43 Strikeouts, 1 Hit Batsmen, 1 Wild Pitch, 323 Batters Faced, 4 Intentional Walks, 2 Balks and a 3.58 ERA. Havens was the opening day starter for the Twins in 1983, at home against the Detroit Tigers, but after posting a 5-8 record with an ERA of 8.18, he never appeared in a Twins uniform again. Although the rest of his career was entirely unremarkable, Havens was voted a full-share bonus and awarded a player's ring by his fellow former teammates for his limited role (0-0, 4.66 ERA) in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 1988 championship season. Havens, who prepped at Royal Oak (MI) Kimball High School, joined Kirk Gibson, who graduated from Waterford (MI) Kettering as two metro Detroit natives on that World Series team. In eight years, Havens had a 24‚Äì37 Win-Loss record, 205 Games, 61 Games Started, 6 Complete Games, 2 Shutouts, 63 Games Finished, 3 Saves, 590 ‚Öî Innings Pitched, 624 Hits Allowed, 336 Runs Allowed, 316 Earned Runs Allowed, 76 Home Runs Allowed, 246 Walks Allowed, 370 Strikeouts, 5 Hit Batsmen, 21 Wild Pitches, 2,580 Batters Faced, 31 Intentional Walks, 7 Balks and a 4.81 ERA.

A Map of the world showing rape per 100,000 population (as of 2018). Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent. The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault. The rate of reporting, prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions. Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged, per 100,000 people, from 0.2 in Azerbaijan to 92.9 in Botswana with 6.3 in Lithuania as the median.\\"Rape at the National Level, number of police recorded offenses\\". United Nations. Worldwide, sexual violence, including rape, is primarily committed by males against females. Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows, and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape.Human Rights WatchNo Escape: Male Rape In U.S. Prisons. Part VII. Anomaly or Epidemic: The Incidence of Prisoner-on-Prisoner Rape.; estimates that 100,000‚Äì140,000 violent male-male rapes occur in U.S. prisons annually; compare with FBI statistics that estimate 90,000 violent male-female rapes occur annually.Robert W. Dumond, \\"Ignominious Victims: Effective Treatment of Male Sexual Assault in Prison,\\" August 15, 1995, p. 2; states that \\"evidence suggests that [male-male sexual assault in prison] may be a staggering problem\\". Quoted in ; reports that \\"Greater percentages of men (70%) than women (29%) reported that their incident resulted in oral, vaginal, or anal sex. More men (54%) than women (28%) reported an incident that was classified as rape.\\" Widespread and systematic rape (e.g., war rape) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict. These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes. Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group. People who have been raped can be traumatized and develop posttraumatic stress disorder. Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. A person may face violence or threats from the rapist, and, in some cultures, from the victim's family and relatives.  Etymology  The term rape originates from the Latin rapere (supine stem raptum), \\"to snatch, to grab, to carry off\\".Corinne J. Saunders, Rape and Ravishment in the Literature of Medieval England, Boydell & Brewer, 2001, p. 20.Keith Burgess-Jackson, A Most Detestable Crime: New Philosophical Essays on Rape, Oxford University Press, New York, 1999, p.16. Since the 14th century, the term has come to mean \\"to seize and take away by force\\". In Roman law, the carrying off of a woman by force, with or without intercourse, constituted \\"raptus\\". In Medieval English law the same term could refer to either kidnapping or rape in the modern sense of \\"sexual violation\\". The original meaning of \\"carry off by force\\" is still found in some phrases, such as \\"rape and pillage\\", or in titles, such as the stories of the Rape of the Sabine Women and The Rape of Europa or the poem The Rape of the Lock, which is about the theft of a lock of hair.  Definitions  = General = Rape is defined in most jurisdictions as sexual intercourse, or other forms of sexual penetration, committed by a perpetrator against a victim without their consent. The definition of rape is inconsistent between governmental health organizations, law enforcement, health providers, and legal professions. It has varied historically and culturally. Originally, rape had no sexual connotation and is still used in other contexts in English. In Roman law, it or raptus was classified as a form of crimen vis, \\"crime of assault\\".Justinian, Institutiones Adolf Berger, Encyclopedic Dictionary on Roman Law, pp. 667 (raptus) and 768 (vis) [] Raptus referred to the abduction of a woman against the will of the man under whose authority she lived, and sexual intercourse was not a necessary element. Other definitions of rape have changed over time. Until 2012, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) considered rape a crime solely committed by men against women. In 2012, they changed their definition from \\"The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will\\" to \\"The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\\" The previous definition, which had remained unchanged since 1927, was considered outdated and narrow. The updated definition includes recognizing any gender of victim and perpetrator and that rape with an object can be as traumatic as penile/vaginal rape. The bureau further describes instances when the victim is unable to give consent because of mental or physical incapacity. It recognizes that a victim can be incapacitated by drugs and alcohol and unable to give valid consent. The definition does not change federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the federal, state or local level; it rather means that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide. Health organizations and agencies have also expanded rape beyond traditional definitions. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines rape as a form of sexual assault, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes rape in their definition of sexual assault; they term rape a form of sexual violence. The CDC lists other acts of coercive, non-consensual sexual activity that may or may not include rape, including drug-facilitated sexual assault, acts in which a victim is made to penetrate a perpetrator or someone else, intoxication where the victim is unable to consent (due to incapacitation or being unconscious), non-physically forced penetration which occurs after a person is pressured verbally (by intimidation or misuse of authority to force to consent), or completed or attempted forced penetration of a victim via unwanted physical force (including using a weapon or threatening to use a weapon). The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has implemented universal screening for what has been termed \\"military sexual trauma\\" (MST) and provides medical and mental health services free of charge to enrolled veterans who report MST (Title 38 United States Code 1720D; Public Law 108-422). Some countries or jurisdictions differentiate between rape and sexual assault by defining rape as involving penile penetration of the vagina, or solely penetration involving the penis, while other types of non-consensual sexual activity are called sexual assault. Scotland, for example, emphasizes penile penetration, requiring that the sexual assault must have been committed by use of a penis to qualify as rape. The 1998 International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda defines rape as \\"a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive\\". In other cases, the term rape has been phased out of legal use in favor of terms such as sexual assault or criminal sexual conduct. = Scope = Victims of rape or sexual assault come from a wide range of genders, ages, sexual orientations, ethnicitities, geographical locations, cultures, and degrees of impairment or disability. Incidences of rape are classified into a number of categories, and they may describe the relationship of the perpetrator to the victim and the context of the sexual assault. These include date rape, gang rape, marital rape, incestual rape, child sexual abuse, prison rape, acquaintance rape, war rape and statutory rape. Forced sexual activity can be committed over a long period of time with little to no physical injury. = Consent = Lack of consent is key to the definition of rape. Consent is affirmative \\"informed approval, indicating a freely given agreement\\" to sexual activity. It is not necessarily expressed verbally, and may instead be overtly implied from actions, but the absence of objection does not constitute consent. Lack of consent may result from either forcible compulsion by the perpetrator or an inability to consent on the part of the victim (such as people who are asleep, intoxicated or otherwise mentally compromised).Rape and sexual violence: Human rights law and standards in the International Criminal Court. Amnesty International 2011 Sexual intercourse with a person below the age of consent, i.e., the age at which legal competence is established, is referred to as statutory rape. In India, consensual sex given on the false promise of marriage constitutes rape. Duress is the situation when the person is threatened by force or violence, and may result in the absence of an objection to sexual activity. This can lead to the presumption of consent. Duress may be actual or threatened force or violence against the victim or someone close to the victim. Even blackmail may constitute duress. Abuse of power may constitute duress. For instance, in the Philippines, a man commits rape if he engages in sexual intercourse with a woman \\"By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority\\".REPUBLIC ACT NO. 8353. Philippine Law. Approved: September 30, 1997 The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in its landmark 1998 judgment used a definition of rape which did not use the word 'consent': \\"a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive.\\"Fourth Annual Report of ICTR to the General Assembly (1999) March 23, 2007 Marital rape, or spousal rape, is non-consensual sex in which the perpetrator is the victim's spouse. It is a form of partner rape, domestic violence, and sexual abuse. Once widely accepted or ignored by law, spousal rape is now denounced by international conventions and is increasingly criminalized. Still, in many countries, spousal rape either remains legal, or is illegal but widely tolerated and accepted as a husband's prerogative. In 2006, the UN Secretary-General's In-depth study on all forms of violence against women stated that (pg 113): \\"Marital rape may be prosecuted in at least 104 states. Of these, 32 have made marital rape a specific criminal offence, while the remaining 74 do not exempt marital rape from general rape provisions. Marital rape is not a prosecutable offense in at least 53 States. Four States criminalize marital rape only when the spouses are judicially separated. Four States are considering legislation that would allow marital rape to be prosecuted.\\" Since 2006, several other states have outlawed marital rape (for example Thailand in 2007). In the US, the criminalization of marital rape started in the mid-1970s and in 1993 North Carolina became the last state to make marital rape illegal. In many countries, it is not clear if marital rape may or may not be prosecuted under ordinary rape laws. In the absence of a spousal rape law, it may be possible to bring prosecution for acts of forced sexual intercourse inside marriage by prosecuting, through the use of other criminal offenses (such as assault based offenses), the acts of violence or criminal threat that were used to obtain submission. Consent may be complicated by law, language, context, culture and sexual orientation. Studies have shown that men consistently perceive women's actions as more sexual than they intend. In addition, verbalized 'no' to sex may be interpreted as 'keep trying', or even 'yes' by offenders. Some may believe that when injuries are not visible, the woman must have consented. If a man solicits sex from another man, the pursuer may be regarded as virile.  Motives  The WHO states that the principal factors that lead to the perpetration of sexual violence against women, including rape, are: * beliefs in family honor and sexual purity; * attitudes of male sexual entitlement; * weak legal sanctions for sexual violence. No single facet explains the motivation for rape; the underlying motives of rapists can be multi-faceted. Several factors have been proposed: anger,Oliva, Janet R. Sexually Motivated Crimes: Understanding the Profile of the Sex Offender and Applying Theory to Practice. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2013.Pg 72 power,Oliva, Janet R. Sexually Motivated Crimes: Understanding the Profile of the Sex Offender and Applying Theory to Practice. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2013.Pg 72 sadism, sexual gratification, or evolutionary proclivities. However, some factors have significant causal evidence supporting them. American clinical psychologist David Lisak, co-author of a 2002 study of undetected rapists, Pdf. says that compared with non-rapists, both undetected and convicted rapists are measurably more angry at women and more motivated by a desire to dominate and control them, are more impulsive, disinhibited, anti-social, hypermasculine, and less empathic. Pdf. Sexual aggression is often considered a masculine identity characteristic of manhood in some male groups and is significantly correlated to the desire to be held higher in esteem among male peers. Sexually aggressive behavior among young men has been correlated with gang or group membership as well as having other delinquent peers. Gang rape is often perceived by male perpetrators as a justified method of discouraging or punishing what they consider as immoral behavior among women for example wearing short skirts or visiting bars. In some areas in Papua New Guinea, women can be punished by public gang rape, usually through permission by elders.Jenkins C. Sexual behavior in Papua New Guinea. In: Report of the Third Annual Meeting of the International Network on Violence Against Women, January 1998. Washington, DC, International Network on Violence Against Women, 1998. Gang rape and mass rape are often used as a means of male bonding. This is particularly evident among soldiers, as gang rape accounts for about three quarters or more of war rape while gang rape accounts for less than a quarter of rapes during peace time. Commanders sometimes push recruits to rape, as committing rape can be taboo and illegal and so builds loyalty among those involved. Rebel groups who have forced recruitment as opposed to volunteer recruits are more involved in rape as it is believed the recruits start off with less loyalty to the group. In Papua New Guinea, urban gangs such as Raskol gangs often require raping women for initiation reasons. Perpetrators of sex trafficking and cybersex trafficking allow or carry out rape p. 64. for financial gain and or sexual gratification. Rape pornography, including child pornography, is created for profit and other reasons.  Effects  One metric used by the WHO to determine the severity of global rates of coercive, forced sexual activity was the question \\"Have you ever been forced to have sexual intercourse against your will?\\" Asking this question produced higher positive response rates than being asked, whether they had ever been abused or raped. The WHO report describes the consequences of sexual abuse: * Gynecological disorders * Reproductive disorders * Sexual disorders * Infertility * Pelvic inflammatory disease * Pregnancy complications * Miscarriage * Sexual dysfunction * Acquiring sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS * Mortality from injuries * Increased risk of suicide * Depression * Chronic pain * Psychosomatic disorders * Unsafe abortion * Unwanted pregnancy (see Pregnancy from rape) = Emotional and psychological = Frequently, victims may not recognize what happened to them was rape. Some may remain in denial for years afterwards. Confusion over whether or not their experience constitutes rape is typical, especially for victims of psychologically coerced rape. Women may not identify their victimization as rape for many reasons such as feelings of shame, embarrassment, non-uniform legal definitions, reluctance to define the friend/partner as a rapist, or because they have internalized victim-blaming attitudes. The public perceives these behaviors as 'counterintuitive' and therefore, as evidence of a dishonest woman. During the assault, a person will respond with fight, flight, freeze, friend (sometimes called fawn),Matley, Eliza. Presenting the Key to Learning: Comfort Corners. \\"Trauma Responses: Fight, Flight, Freeze or Fawn?\\" https://www.csustan.edu/sites/default/files/groups/University%20Honors%20Program/Journals/eliza_matley.pdf or flop. Victims may react in ways they did not anticipate. After the rape, they may be uncomfortable/frustrated with and not understand their reactions.Note: One of the authors of the \\"Psychological consequences of sexual assault\\" article describes what she means by \\"friend\\" and \\"flop\\" in an article: Friend: \\"Friend is the earliest defensive strategy available to us..... Throughout life when fearful most humans will activate their social engagement system (Porges, 1995). ... The social engagement system, or friend response to threat, is evident in the child who smiles or even laughs when being chastised.\\" Flop: \\"Flop occurs if, and when, the freeze mechanism fails.... The survival purpose of the flop state is evident: if ‚Äòimpact‚Äô is going to occur the likelihood of surviving it will be increased if the body yields, and psychologically, in the short-term at least, the situation will be more bearable if the higher brain functions are ‚Äòoffline‚Äô.\\" Most victims respond by 'freezing up' or becoming compliant and cooperative during the rape. These are common survival responses of all mammals. This can cause confusion for others and the person assaulted. An assumption is that someone being raped would call for help or struggle. A struggle would result in torn clothes or injuries. Dissociation can occur during the assault. Memories may be fragmented especially immediately afterwards. They may consolidate with time and sleep. A man or boy who is raped may be stimulated and even ejaculate during the experience of the rape. A woman or girl may orgasm during a sexual assault. This may become a source of shame and confusion for those assaulted along with those who were around them. Trauma symptoms may not show until years after the sexual assault occurred. Immediately following a rape, the survivor may react outwardly in a wide range of ways, from expressive to closed down; common emotions include distress, anxiety, shame, revulsion, helplessness, and guilt. Denial is not uncommon. In the weeks following the rape, the survivor may develop symptoms of post traumatic stress syndrome and may develop wide array of psychosomatic complaints. PTSD symptoms include re- experiencing of the rape, avoiding things associated with the rape, numbness, and increased anxiety and startle response. The likelihood of sustained severe symptoms is higher if the rapist confined or restrained the person, if the person being raped believed the rapist would kill them, the person who was raped was very young or very old, and if the rapist was someone they knew. The likelihood of sustained severe symptoms is also higher if people around the survivor ignore (or are ignorant of) the rape or blame the rape survivor. Most people recover from rape in three to four months, but many have persistent PTSD that may manifest in anxiety, depression, substance abuse, irritability, anger, flashbacks, or nightmares. In addition, rape survivors may have long term generalised anxiety disorder, may develop one or more specific phobias, major depressive disorder, and may experience difficulties with resuming their social life, and with sexual functioning. People who have been raped are at higher risk of suicide. Men experience similar psychological effects of being raped, but they are less likely to seek counseling. Another effect of rape and sexual assault is the stress created in those who study rape or counsel the survivors. This is called vicarious traumatization. = Physical = The presence or absence of physical injury may be used to determine whether a rape has occurred. Those who have experienced sexual assault yet have no physical trauma may be less inclined to report to the authorities or to seek health care. While penetrative rape generally does not involve the use of a condom, in some cases a condom is used. Use of a condom significantly reduces the likelihood of pregnancy and disease transmission, both to the victim and to the rapist. Rationales for condom use include: avoiding contracting infections or diseases (particularly HIV), especially in cases of rape of sex workers or in gang rape (to avoid contracting infections or diseases from fellow rapists); eliminating evidence, making prosecution more difficult (and giving a sense of invulnerability); giving the appearance of consent (in cases of acquaintance rape); and thrill from planning and the use of the condom as an added prop. Concern for the victim is generally not considered a factor. = Sexually transmitted infections = Those who have been raped have relatively more reproductive tract infections than those not been raped. HIV can be transmitted through rape. Acquiring AIDS through rape puts people risk of suffering psychological problems. Acquiring HIV through rape may lead to the in behaviors that create risk of injecting drugs. Acquiring sexually transmitted infections increases the risk of acquiring HIV. The belief that having sex with a virgin can cure HIV/AIDS exists in parts of Africa. This leads to the rape of girls and women. The claim that the myth drives either HIV infection or child sexual abuse in South Africa is disputed by researchers Rachel Jewkes and Helen Epstein. \\"In the current South African case, this claim is predicated on racist assumptions about the amorality of African men...\\" = Victim blaming, secondary victimization and other mistreatment = Society's treatment of victims has the potential to exacerbate their trauma. People who have been raped or sexually assaulted are sometimes blamed and considered responsible for the crime. This refers to the just world fallacy and rape myth acceptance that certain victim behaviors (such as being intoxicated, flirting or wearing sexually provocative clothing) may encourage rape.Pauwels, B. (2002). \\"Blaming the victim of rape: The culpable control model perspective.\\" Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 63(5-B). In many cases, victims are said to have \\"asked for it\\" because of not resisting their assault or violating female gender expectations. A global survey of attitudes toward sexual violence by the Global Forum for Health Research shows that victim-blaming concepts are at least partially accepted in many countries. Women who have been raped are sometimes deemed to have behaved improperly. Usually, these are cultures where there is a significant social divide between the freedoms and status afforded to men and women. > \\"Rape victims are blamed more when they resist the attack later in the rape > encounter rather than earlier (Kopper, 1996), which seems to suggest the > stereotype that these women are engaging in token resistance (Malamuth & > Brown, 1994; Muehlenhard & Rogers, 1998) or leading the man on because they > have gone along with the sexual experience thus far.

These include the idea that power is reserved to men whereas women are meant for sex and objectified, that women want forced sex and to be pushed around,Neumann, S., Gang Rape: Examining Peer Support and Alcohol in Fraternities. Sex Crimes and Paraphilias and that male sexual impulses and behaviors are uncontrollable and must be satisfied. For females, victim-blaming correlates with fear. Many rape victims blame themselves. Female jurors might look at the woman on the witness stand and believe she had done something to entice the defendant. In Chinese culture, victim blaming often is associated with the crime of rape, as women are expected to resist rape using physical force. Thus, if rape occurs, it is considered to be at least partly the woman's fault, and her virtue is called into question.Xue J, Fang G, Huang H, Cui N, Rhodes KV, Gelles R. Rape myths and the cross-cultural adaptation of the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale in China. Journal of Interpersonal Violence. 2016 5. [Epub ahead of print]. DOI: 10.1177/0886260516651315  Honor killings and forced marriages  In many cultures, those who are raped have a high risk of suffering additional violence or threats of violence after the rape. This can be perpetrated by the rapist, friends, or relatives of the rapist. The intent can be to prevent the victim from reporting the rape. Other reasons for threats against the those assaulted is to punish them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint. The relatives of the person who has been raped may wish to prevent \\"bringing shame\\" to the family and may also threaten them. This is especially the case in cultures where female virginity is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in honor killings.  Treatment  Non-genital injuries to women who are sexually assaulted In the US, victims' rights include the right to have a victims advocate preside over every step of the medical/legal exam to ensure sensitivity towards victims, provide emotional support, and minimize the risk of re-traumatization. Victims are to be informed of this immediately by law enforcement or medical service providers. Emergency rooms of many hospitals employ sexual assault nurse/forensic examiners (SAN/FEs) with specific training to care for those who have experienced a rape or sexual assault. They are able to conduct a focused medical-legal exam. If such a trained clinician is not available, the emergency department has a sexual assault protocol that has been established for treatment and the collection of evidence. STAT!Ref Online Electronic Medical Library[subscription required] Staff are also trained to explain the examinations in detail, the documentation and the rights associated with the requirement for informed consent. Emphasis is placed on performing the examinations at a pace that is appropriate for the person, their family, their age, and their level of understanding. Privacy is recommended to prevent self-harm. = Non-genital injuries = Physical assessment Many rapes do not result in serious physical injury. The first medical response to sexual assault is a complete assessment. This general assessment will prioritize the treatment of injuries by the emergency room staff. Medical personnel involved are trained to assess and treat those assaulted or follow protocols established to ensure privacy and best treatment practices. Informed consent is always required prior to treatment unless the person who was assaulted is unconscious, intoxicated or does not have the mental capacity to give consent. Priorities governing the physical exam are the treatment of serious life-threatening emergencies and then a general and complete assessment. Some physical injuries are readily apparent such as, bites, broken teeth, swelling, bruising, lacerations and scratches. In more violent cases, the victim may need to have gunshot wounds or stab wounds treated. The loss of consciousness is relevant to the medical history. If abrasions are found, immunization against tetanus is offered if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization. Diagnostic testing After the general assessment and treatment of serious injuries, further evaluation may include the use of additional diagnostic testing such as x-rays, CT or MRI image studies and blood work. The presence of infection is determined by sampling of body fluids from the mouth, throat, vagina, perineum, and anus. Forensic sampling Victims have the right to refuse any evidence collection. Victims advocates ensure the victims' wishes are respected by hospital staff. After the physical injuries are addressed and treatment has begun, then forensic examination proceeds along with the gathering of evidence that can be used to identify and document the injuries. Such evidence- gathering is only done with the complete consent of the patient or the caregivers of the patient. Photographs of the injuries may be requested by staff. At this point in the treatment, if a victims' advocate had not been requested earlier, experienced social support staff are made available to the patient and family. If the patient or the caregivers, (typically parents) agree, the medical team utilizes standardized sampling and testing usually referred to a forensic evidence kit or \\"rape kit\\". The patient is informed that submitting to the use of the rape kit does not obligate them to file criminal charges against the perpetrator. The patient is discouraged from bathing or showering for the purpose of obtaining samples from their hair. Evidence gathered within the past 72 hours is more likely to be valid. The sooner that samples are obtained after the assault, the more likely that evidence is present in the sample and provide valid results. Once the injuries of the patient have been treated and she or he is stabilized, the sample gathering will begin. Staff will encourage the presence of a rape/sexual assault counselor to provide an advocate and reassurance. During the medical exam, evidence of bodily secretions is assessed. Dried semen that is on clothing and skin can be detected with a fluorescent lamp.\\"Semen fluoresces best at wavelengths of 420 and 450 nm, when viewed through orange goggles. A Wood lamp emits light at only 360-nm wavelength. Therefore specialized alternate light sources that emit wavelengths at 420 and 450 nm, such as a Bluemaxx, should be used. Although this type of lamp will improve the detection of dried semen, many other substances will fluoresce as well; thus, confirmation of semen cannot be made with this method.\\", McInerny (2017) Notes will be attached to those items on which semen has been found. These specimens are marked, placed in a paper bag,This practice discourages the growth of microorganisms which could alter analysis. Cybulska and be marked for later analysis for the presence of seminal vesicle-specific antigen. Though technically, medical staff are not part of the legal system, only trained medical personnel can obtain evidence that is admissible during a trial. The procedures have been standardized. Evidence is collected, signed, and locked in a secure place to guarantee that legal evidence procedures are maintained. This carefully monitored procedure of evidence collection and preservation is known as the chain of evidence. Maintaining the chain of evidence from the medical examination, testing and tissue sampling from its origin of collection to court allows the results of the sampling to be admitted as evidence. The use of photography is often used for documentation. =After the examination= Some physical effects of the rape are not immediately apparent. Follow up examinations also assess the patient for tension headaches, fatigue, sleep pattern disturbances, gastrointestinal irritability, chronic pelvic pain, menstrual pain or irregularity, pelvic inflammatory disease, sexual dysfunction, premenstrual distress, fibromyalgia, vaginal discharge, vaginal itching, burning during urination, and generalized vaginal pain. The World Health Organization recommends offering prompt access to emergency contraceptive medications which can significantly reduce risk of an undesired pregnancy if used within 5 days of rape; it is estimated that about 5% of male-on-female rapes result in pregnancy. When rape results in pregnancy, abortion pills can be safely and effectively used to end a pregnancy up to 10 weeks from the last menstrual period. In the US, federal funding is available to cover the cost of abortion services for pregnancies that occur as a result of rape, even in states that do not offer public-funding for abortion services. = Genital injuries = An internal pelvic exam is not recommended for sexually immature or prepubescent girls due to the probability that internal injuries do not exist in this age group. An internal exam may be recommended if significant bloody discharge is observed, though. A complete pelvic exam for rape (anal or vaginal) is conducted. An oral exam is done if there have been injuries to the mouth, teeth, gums or pharynx. Though the patient may have no complaints about genital pain signs of trauma can still be assessed. Prior to the complete bodily and genital exam, the patient is asked to undress, standing on a white sheet that collects any debris that may be in the clothing. The clothing and sheet are properly bagged and labeled along with other samples that can be removed from the body or clothing of the patient. Samples of fibers, mud, hair, leaves are gathered if present. Samples of fluids are collected to determine the presence of the perpetrator's saliva and semen that may be present in the patients mouth, vagina or rectum. Sometimes the victim has scratched the perpetrator in defense and fingernail scrapings can be collected. Injuries to the genital areas can be swelling, lacerations, and bruising. Common genital injuries are anal injury, labial abrasions, hymenal bruising, tears of the posterior fourchette and fossa. Bruises, tears, abrasions, inflammation and lacerations may be visible. If a foreign object was used during the assault, x-ray visualization will identify retained fragments. Genital injuries are more prevalent in post-menopausal women and prepubescent girls. Internal injuries to the cervix and vagina can be visualized using colposcopy. Using colposcopy has increased the detection of internal trauma from six percent to fifty-three percent. Genital injuries to children who have been raped or sexually assaulted differ in that the abuse may be on-going or it happened in the past after the injuries heal. Scarring is one sign of the sexual abuse of children. Several studies have explored the association between skin color and genital injury among rape victims. Many studies found a difference in rape-related injury based on race, with more injuries being reported for white females and males than for black females and males. This may be because the dark skin color of some victims obscures bruising. Examiners paying attention to victims with darker skin, especially the thighs, labia majora, posterior fourchette, and fossa navicularis, can help remedy this.Baker RB, Fargo JD, Shambley-Ebron D, Sommers MS. A source of healthcare disparity: Race, skin color, and injuries after rape among adolescents and young adults. Journal of Forensic Nursing, 2010; 6: 144-150 = Infections = The presence of a sexually contracted infection can not be confirmed after rape because it cannot be detected until 72 hours afterwards.[subscription required] The person who was raped may already have a sexually transmitted bacterial, viral and other infections and if diagnosed, it is treated. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment for vaginitis, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis and chlamydia may be done. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections in women are of particular concern due to the possibility of ascending infection. Immunization against hepatitis B is often considered.[subscription required] After prophylactic treatment is initiated, further testing is done to determine what other treatments may be necessary for other infections transmitted during the assault. These are: * Serum hepatitis B surface antigen assay * Microscopic evaluation of vaginal discharge (saline wash and staining) * Cultures for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis from each penetrated location * Serum Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test * Complete blood count (CBC) * Liver function tests * Serum creatinine level Treatment may include the administration of zidovudine/lamivudine, tenofovir/emtricitabine, ritonavir/lopinavir. Information regarding other treatment options are available from the CDC. The transmission of HIV is frequently a major concern of the patient. Prophylactic treatment for HIV is not necessarily administered. Routine treatment for HIV after rape or sexual assault is controversial due to the low risk of infection after one sexual assault. Transmission of HIV after one exposure to penetrative anal sex is estimated to be 0.5 to 3.2 percent. Transmission of HIV after one exposure to penetrative vaginal intercourse is 0.05 to 0.15 percent. HIV can also be contracted through the oral route but is considered rare. Other recommendations are that the patient be treated prophylactically for HIV if the perpetrator is found to be infected. Testing at the time of the initial exam does not typically have forensic value if patients are sexually active and have an STI since it could have been acquired prior to the assault. Rape shield laws protect the person who was raped and who has positive test results. These laws prevent having such evidence used against someone who was raped. Someone who was raped may be concerned that a prior infection may suggest sexual promiscuity. There may, however, be situations in which testing has the legal purpose, as in cases where the threat of transmission or actual transmission of an STI was part of the crime. In nonsexually active patients, an initial, baseline negative test that is followed by a subsequent STI could be used as evidence, if the perpetrator also had an STI. Treatment failure is possible due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens. = Emotional and psychiatric = Psychiatric and emotional consequences can be apparent immediately after rape and it may be necessary to treat these very early in the evaluation and treatment. Other treatable emotional and psychiatric disorders may not become evident until some time after the rape. These can be eating disorders, anxiety, fear, intrusive thoughts, fear of crowds, avoidance, anger, depression, humiliation, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) hyperarousal, sexual disorders (including fear of engaging in sexual activity), mood disorders, suicidal ideation, borderline personality disorder, nightmares, fear of situations that remind the patient of the rape and fear of being alone, agitation, numbness and emotional distance. Victims are able to receive help by using a telephone hotline, counseling, or shelters. Recovery from sexual assault is a complicated and controversial concept, but support groups, usually accessed by organizations are available to help in recovery. Professional counseling and on-going treatment by trained health care providers is often sought by the victim. There are clinicians who are specially trained in the treatment of those who have experienced rape and sexual assault/abuse. Treatment can be lengthy and be challenging for both the counselor and the patient. Several treatment options exist and vary by accessibility, cost, or whether or not insurance coverage exists for the treatment. Treatment also varies dependent upon the expertise of the counselor‚Äîsome have more experience and or have specialized in the treatment of sexual trauma and rape. To be the most effective, a treatment plan should be developed based upon the struggles of the patient and not necessarily based upon the traumatic experience. An effective treatment plan will take the following into consideration: current stressors, coping skills, physical health, interpersonal conflicts, self-esteem, family issues, involvement of the guardian, and the presence of mental health symptoms. The degree of success for emotional and psychiatric treatments is often dependent upon the terminology used in the treatment, i.e. redefining the event and experience. Labels used like rape victim and rape survivor to describe the new identities of women who have been raped suggest that the event is the dominant and controlling influence on her life. These may have an effect on supportive personnel. The consequences of using these labels needs to be assessed. Positive outcomes of emotional and psychiatric treatment for rape exist; these can be an improved self-concept, the recognition of growth, and implementing new coping styles. A perpetrator found guilty by the court is often required to receive treatment. There are many options for treatment, some more successful than others. The psychological factors that motivated the convicted perpetrator are complex but treatment can still be effective. A counselor will typically evaluate disorders that are currently present in the offender. Investigating the developmental background of the offender can help explain the origins of the abusive behavior occurred in the first place. Emotional and psychological treatment has the purpose of identifying predictors of recidivism, or the potential that the offender will commit rape again. In some instances neurological abnormalities have been identified in the perpetrators, and in some cases they have themselves experienced past trauma. Adolescents and other children can be the perpetrators of rape, although this is uncommon. In this instance, appropriate counseling and evaluation are usually conducted. Short-term treatment with a benzodiazepine may help with anxiety (although caution is recommended with use of these medications as people can become addicted and develop withdrawal symptoms after regular use) and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder, depression and panic attacks.  Prevention  As sexual violence affects all parts of society, the response to sexual violence is comprehensive. The responses can be categorized as: individual approaches, health care responses, community-based efforts and actions to prevent other forms of sexual violence. Sexual assault may be prevented by secondary school, college, and workplace education programs. At least one program for fraternity men produced \\"sustained behavioral change.\\" With regard to campus sexual assault, nearly two thirds of students reported knowing victims of rape and over half reported knowing perpetrators of sexual assault in one study; one in ten reported knowing a victim of rape and nearly one in four reported knowing a victim of alcohol-facilitated rape.Sorenson SB, Joshi M, Sivitz E. Knowing a sexual assault victim or perpetrator: A stratified random sample of undergraduates at one university. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 2014; 29: 394-416  Statistics  right = Worldwide = International Crime on Statistics and Justice by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) find that worldwide, most victims of rape are women and most perpetrators male. Rapes against women are rarely reported to the police and the number of female rape victims is significantly underestimated. Southern Africa, Oceania and North America report the highest numbers of rape. Most rape is committed by someone the victim knows. By contrast, rape committed by strangers is relatively uncommon. Statistics reported by the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) indicate that 7 out of 10 cases of sexual assault involved a perpetrator known to the victim. UNODC : Reported rape per 100,000 population (2011) The humanitarian news organization IRIN claims that an estimated \\"500,000 rapes are committed annually in South Africa once called 'the world's rape capital.'\\"South Africa, once called 'the world's rape capital,' is running out of rape kits\\". The Washington Post. March 5, 2013. The country has some of the highest incidences of child sexual abuse in the world with more than 67,000 cases of rape and sexual assaults against children reported in 2000, with welfare groups believing that unreported incidents could be up to 10 times higher.\\"South African men rape babies as 'cure' for Aids\\". The Daily Telegraph. November 11, 2001 Current data suggest that the incidence of rape has risen significantly in India. Most rape research and reports of rape are limited to male‚Äìfemale forms of rape. Research on male-on-male and female-on- male rape is rare. Fewer than one in ten male-male rapes are reported. As a group, males who have been raped by either gender often get little services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped to deal with this type of crime. Instances in which the perpetrator is female may not be clear and can lead to dismissing women as sexual aggressors, which can obscure the dimensions of the problem. Research also suggests that men with sexually aggressive peers have a higher chance of reporting coercive or forced sexual intercourse outside gang circles than men without such sexually aggressive peers. = United States = FBI sex offense victims in 2012: * 67,354 female * 12,000 male. FBI convicted sex offenders in 2012: * 78,500 male * 4,394 female. Statistics maintained by the CDC include: * one in four of women and one in nine men have experienced sexual violence, stalking or rape * one in three women and one in six men experienced violent sexual contact in their life * nearly 23 million women and 1.7 million men have been victims of rape or attempted rape at some point in their lives * 8.5 million women experienced rape before age 18 * 1.5 million men were made to penetrate before age 18 * one in four women have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner * one in seven men have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner Risk factors vary among different ethnicities. About one third of African American adolescent females report encountering some form of sexual assault including rape. One in three Native American women will experience sexual assault, more than twice the national average for American women. More than 250,000 cases of rape or attempted rape were recorded by police annually in 65 countries in 2001 through 2002.The Eighth United Nations Survey on Crime Trends and the Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (2001‚Äì2002) ‚Äì Table 02.08 Total recorded rapes. unodc.org In 2007, 40% of the 90,427 forcible rapes reported were cleared by arrest or \\"exceptional means.\\" Exceptional refers to situations where the person refuses to provide information or assistance necessary to obtain an arrest, the defendant dies before being arrested, or the defendant cannot be extradited from another state. Forty-three percent of high school and young college men reported being coerced into sexual behavior and, of those, 95% reported that a female was the aggressor.French, Bryana H., Jasmine D. Tilghman, and Dominique A. Malebranche, \\"Sexual Coercion Context and Psychosocial Correlates Among Diverse Males\\", University of Missouri, Psychology of Men and Masculinity; online March, 2014  Prosecution  = Reporting = People in Bangalore, India demanding justice for young student who was gang-raped in Delhi in December 2012. In 2005, sexual violence, and rape in particular, was considered the most under-reported violent crime in Great Britain. The number of reported rapes in Great Britain is lower than both incidence and prevalence rates. Victims who do not act in an expected or stereotypical way may not be believed, as happened in the case of a Washington state woman raped in 2008 who withdrew her report after facing police skepticism. Her rapist went on to assault several more women before being identified. The legal requirements for reporting rape vary by jurisdiction‚Äîeach US state may have different requirements. New Zealand has less stringent limits. In Italy, a 2006 National Statistic Institute survey on sexual violence against women found that 91.6% of women who suffered this did not report it to the police. = Conviction = In the United Kingdom, In 1970 there was a 33% rate of conviction, while by 1985 there was a 24 per cent conviction rate for rape trials in the UK, by 2004 the conviction rate reached 5%. At that time the government report has expressed documented the year-on-year increase in attrition of reported rape cases, and pledged to address this \\"justice gap\\". According to Amnesty International Ireland had the lowest rate of conviction for rape, (1%) among 21 European states, in 2003. In America as of 2012, there exists a noticeable discrepancy in conviction rates among women of various ethnic identities; an arrest was made in just 13% of the sexual assaults reported by American Indian women, compared with 35% for black women and 32% for whites. Judicial bias due to rape myths and preconceived notions about rape is a salient issue in rape conviction, but voir dire intervention may be used to curb such bias.Mallios C, Meisner T. Educating juries in sexual assault cases: Using voir dire to eliminate jury bias. Strategies: The Prosecutors‚Äô Newsletter on Violence Against Women, 2010; 2. http://www.aequitasresource.org/EducatingJuriesInSexualAssaultCasesPart1.pdf  False accusation  A false accusation of rape is the reporting of a rape where no rape has occurred. It is difficult to assess the true prevalence of false rape allegations, but it is generally agreed by scholars that rape accusations are false about 2% to 10% of the time.DiCanio, M. (1993). The encyclopedia of violence: origins, attitudes, consequences. New York: Facts on File. . In most cases, a false accusation will not name a specific suspect. Eight percent of 2,643 sexual assault cases were classified as false reports by the police in one study. The researchers noted that much of these classifications were based on the personal judgments and biases of the police investigators and were made in violation of official criteria for establishing a false allegation. Closer analysis of this category applying the Home Office counting rules for establishing a false allegation, which requires \\"strong evidential grounds\\" of a false allegation or a \\"clear and credible\\" retraction by the complainant, reduced the percentage of false reports to 3%. The researchers concluded that \\"one cannot take all police designations at face value\\" and that \\"[t]here is an over-estimation of the scale of false allegations by both police officers and prosecutors\\". Another large-scale study was conducted in Australia, with the 850 rapes reported to the Victoria police between 2000 and 2003 (Heenan & Murray, 2006). Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, the researchers examined 812 cases and found 15.1% of complaints were withdrawn, 46.4% were marked \\"no further police action\\", and 2.1% of the total were \\"clearly\\" classified by police as false reports. The researchers noted that where the police found a case to be a false allegation but did not want to pursue charges against the accuser, they marked it as \\"no further police action\\" instead. All of these complainants were then charged or threatened with charges for filing a false police report. In the United Kingdom, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) analyzed every rape complaint made over a 17-month period and found that \\"the indication is that it is therefore extremely rare that a suspect deliberately makes a false allegation of rape or domestic violence purely out of malice.\\".\\"Charging perverting the course of justice and wasting police time in cases involving allegedly false rape and domestic violence allegations\\" Archived from: http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/research/perverting_course_of_justice_march_2013.pdf FBI reports consistently put the number of \\"unfounded\\" rape accusations around 8%. The unfounded rate is higher for forcible rape than for any other Index crime. The average rate of unfounded reports for Index crimes is 2%.Crime Index Offenses Reported. FBI.gov. 1996 \\"Unfounded\\" is not synonymous with false allegation.False Allegations, Recantations, and Unfounding in the Context of Sexual Assault . Attorney General's Sexual Assault Task Force Oregon, US January 10, 2008. Bruce Gross of the Forensic Examiner described it as meaningless, saying a report could be marked as unfounded if there is no physical evidence or the alleged victim did not sustain any physical injuries. Other studies have suggested that the rate of false allegations in America may be higher. A nine-year study by Eugene J. Kanin of Purdue University in a small metropolitan area in the Midwestern United States claimed that 41% of rape accusations were false. However David Lisak, an associate professor of psychology and director of the Men's Sexual Trauma Research Project at the University of Massachusetts Boston states that \\"Kanin's 1994 article on false allegations is a provocative opinion piece, but it is not a scientific study of the issue of false reporting of rape\\". He further states that Kanin's study has significantly poor systematic methodology and had no independent definition of a false report. Instead, Kanin classified reports that the police department classified as false also as false. The criterion for falsehood was simply a denial of a polygraph test of the accuser. A 1998 report by the National Institute of Justice found that DNA evidence excluded the primary suspect in 26% of rape cases and concluded that this \\"strongly suggests that postarrest and postconviction DNA exonerations are tied to some strong, underlying systemic problems that generate erroneous accusations and convictions\\". However, this study also noted that analyzed samples involved a specific subset of rape cases (e.g. those where \\"there is no consent defense\\"). A 2010 study by David Lisak, Lori Gardinier and other researchers published in the journal of Violence against Women found that out of 136 cases reported in a ten-year period, 5.9% were found likely to be false.  History  = Definitions and evolution of laws = Virtually all societies have had a concept of the crime of rape. Although what constituted this crime has varied by historical period and culture, the definitions tended to focus around an act of forced vaginal intercourse perpetrated through physical violence or imminent threat of death or severe bodily injury, by a man, on a woman or a girl, not his wife. The actus reus of the crime, was, in most societies, the insertion of the penis into the vagina. The way sexuality was conceptualized in many societies rejected the very notion that a woman could force a man into sex ‚Äî women were often seen as passive while men were deemed to be assertive and aggressive. Sexual penetration of a male by another male fell under the legal domain of sodomy. Rape laws existed to protect virginal daughters from rape. In these cases, a rape done to a woman was seen as an attack on the estate of her father because she was his property and a woman's virginity being taken before marriage lessened her value; if the woman was married, the rape was an attack on the husband because it violated his property. The rapist was either subject to payment (see wreath money) or severe punishment. The father could rape or keep the rapist's wife or make the rapist marry his daughter. A man could not be charged with raping his wife since she was his property. Thus, marital rape was allowed. Author Winnie Tomm stated, \\"By contrast, rape of a single woman without strong ties to a father or husband caused no great concern.\\" An incident could be excluded from the definition of rape due to the relation between the parties, such as marriage, or due to the background of the victim. In many cultures forced sex on a prostitute, slave, war enemy, member of a racial minority, etc., was not rape. From the classical antiquity of Greece and Rome into the Colonial period, rape along with arson, treason and murder was a capital offense. \\"Those committing rape were subject to a wide range of capital punishments that were seemingly brutal, frequently bloody, and at times spectacular.\\" In the 12th century, kinsmen of the victim were given the option of executing the punishment themselves. \\"In England in the early fourteenth century, a victim of rape might be expected to gouge out the eyes and/or sever the offender's testicles herself.\\"\\"The Medieval Blood Sanction and the Divine Beneficene of Pain: 1100‚Äì1450\\", Trisha Olson, Journal of Law and Religion, 22 JLREL 63 (2006) Despite the harshness of these laws, actual punishments were usually far less severe: in late Medieval Europe, cases concerning rapes of marriageable women, wives, widows, or members of the lower class were rarely brought forward, and usually ended with only a small monetary fine or a marriage between the victim and the rapist. In ancient Greece and Rome, both male-on-female and male-on- male concepts of rape existed. Roman laws allowed three distinct charges for the crime: stuprum, unsanctioned sexual intercourse (which, in the early times, also included adultery); vis, a physical assault for purpose of lust; and iniuria, a general charge denoting any type of assault upon person. Aforementioned Lex Iulia specifically criminalized per vim stuprum, unsanctioned sexual intercourse by force. The former two were public criminal charges which could be brought whenever the victim was a woman or a child of either gender, but only if the victim was a freeborn Roman citizen (ingenuus), and carried potential sentence of death or exile. Iniuria was a civil charge that demanded monetary compensation, and had a wider application (for example, it could have been brought in case of sexual assault on a slave by a person other than their owner.) Augustus Caesar enacted reforms for the crime of rape under the assault statute Lex Iulia de vi publica, which bears his family name, Iulia. It was under this statute rather than the adultery statute of Lex Iulia de adulteriis that Rome prosecuted this crime.James Fitzjames Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England, p. 17 [] Rape was made into a \\"public wrong\\" (iniuria publica) by the Roman Emperor Constantine.George Mousourakis, The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law p. 30 []Brundage, James A., \\"Rape and Seduction in Medieval Canon Law\\", in Sexual Practices and the Medieval Church, edited by Vern L. Bullough and James Brundage, Buffalo, 1982, p.141 In contrast to the modern understanding of the subject, Romans drew clear distinctions between \\"active\\" (penetrative) and \\"passive\\" (receptive) partners, and all these charges implied penetration by the assailant (which necessarily ruled out the possibility of female-on-male or female-on-female rape.) It is not clear which (if any) of these charges applied to assaults upon an adult male, though such an assault upon a citizen was definitely seen as a grave insult (within Roman culture, an adult male citizen could not possibly consent to the receptive role in a sexual intercourse without a severe loss of status.) The law known as Lex Scantinia covered at least some forms of male-on-male stuprum, and Quintillian mentions a fine of 10,000 sesterces ‚Äì about 10 years worth of a Roman legionnaire's pay ‚Äì as a normal penalty for stuprum upon an ingenuus. However, its text is lost and its exact provisions are no longer known. Emperor Justinian continued the use of the statute to prosecute rape during the sixth century in the Eastern Roman Empire.Justinian Institutiones By late antiquity, the general term raptus had referred to abduction, elopement, robbery, or rape in its modern meaning. Confusion over the term led ecclesiastical commentators on the law to differentiate it into raptus seductionis (elopement without parental consent) and raptus violentiae (ravishment). Both of these forms of raptus had a civil penalty and possible excommunication for the family and village receiving the abducted woman, although raptus violentiae also incurred punishments of mutilation or death.Basil of Caesarea, Letters circa 374 AD In the United States, a husband could not be charged with raping his wife until 1979. In the 1950s, in some states in the US, a white woman having consensual sex with a black man was considered rape. Prior to the 1930s, rape was considered a sex crime that was always committed by men and always done to women. From 1935 to 1965, a shift from labeling rapists as criminals to believing them to be mentally ill \\"sexual psychopaths\\" began making its way into popular opinion. Men caught for committing rape were no longer sentenced to prison but admitted to mental health hospitals where they would be given medication for their illness.Maschke, Karen J. The Legal Response to Violence against Women. New York: Garland Pub., 1997. Because only men deemed insane were the ones considered to have committed rape, no one considered the everyday person to be capable of such violence. Transitions in women's roles in society were also shifting, causing alarm and blame towards rape victims. Because women were becoming more involved in the public (i.e. searching for jobs rather than being a housewife), some people claimed that these women were \\"loose\\" and looking for trouble. Giving up the gender roles of mother and wife was seen as defiant against traditional values while immersing themselves within society created the excuse that women would \\"not [be] entitled to protection under the traditional guidelines for male-female relationships\\". Until the 19th century, many jurisdictions required ejaculation for the act to constitute the offense of rape. Acts other than vaginal intercourse did not constitute rape in common law countries and in many other societies. In many cultures, such acts were illegal, even if they were consensual and performed between married couples (see sodomy laws). In England, for example, the Buggery Act 1533, which remained in force until 1828, provided for the death penalty for \\"buggery\\". Many countries criminalized \\"non-traditional\\" forms of sexual activity well into the modern era: notably, in the US state of Idaho, sodomy between consensual partners was punishable by a term of five years to life in prison as late as 2003, and this law was only ruled to be inapplicable to married couples in 1995. Today, in many countries, the definition of the actus reus has been extended to all forms of penetration of the vagina and anus (e.g. penetration with objects, fingers or other body parts) as well as insertion of the penis in the mouth. In the United States, before and during the American Civil War when chattel slavery was widespread, the law focused primarily on rape as it pertained to black men raping white women. The penalty for such a crime in many jurisdictions was death or castration. The rape of a black woman, by any man, was considered legal. As early as the 19th century, American women were criticized if they \\"stray[ed] out of a [dependent] position...fought off [an] attacker...[or] behaved in too self reliant a manner...\\" in which case \\"the term rape no longer applied\\".Hamilton Arnold, Marybeth. \\"Chapter 3 Life of a Citizen in the Hands of a Woman.\\" Passion and Power: Sexuality in History. Ed. Kathy Lee. Peiss, Christina Simmons, and Robert A. Padgug. Philadelphia: Temple UP, 1989. In 1998, Judge Navanethem Pillay of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda said: \\"From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as spoils of war. Now it will be considered a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war.\\" In Aydin v Turkey, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled for the first time that rape amounts to torture, thus violating article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It stated, \\"Rape of a detainee by an official of the State must be considered to be an especially grave and abhorrent form of ill-treatment given the ease with which the offender can exploit the vulnerability and weakened resistance of his victim.\\"ECHR 25 September 1997, no. 57/1996/676/866, paragraph 83, Aydin v Turkey. In M.C. v Bulgaria, the Court found that the use of violence on the part of the perpetrator is not a necessary condition for a sexual act to be qualified as rape. It stated, \\"Indeed, rapists often employ subtle coercion or bullying when this is sufficient to overcome their victims. In most cases of rape against children, violence is not necessary to obtain submission. Courts are also recognizing that some women become frozen with fear at the onset of a sexual attack and thus cannot resist.\\"ECHR 4 december 2003, no. 39272/98, paragraph 146, M.C. v Bulgaria. =War rape= Rape, in the course of war, dates back to antiquity, ancient enough to have been mentioned in the Bible. The Israelite, Persian, Greek and Roman armies reportedly engaged in war rape. The Mongols, who established the Mongol Empire across much of Eurasia, caused much destruction during their invasions.\\"Rise of Mongol Power \\" Historian Jack Weatherford said that the earliest incident of mass rape attributed to Mongols took place after Ogodei Khan sent an army of 25,000 soldiers to North China, where they defeated an army 100,000. The Mongols were said to have raped the surviving soldiers at the command of their leader. Ogodei Khan was also said to have ordered mass rapes of the Oirat. According to Rogerius of Apulia, a monk who survived the Mongol invasion of Hungary, the Mongol warriors \\"found pleasure\\" in humiliating local women. The systematic rape of as many as 80,000 women by the Japanese soldiers during the six weeks of the Nanking Massacre is an example of such atrocities.Chinese city remembers Japanese 'Rape of Nanjing'. CNN. December 13, 1997 During World War II an estimated 200,000 Korean and Chinese women were forced into prostitution in Japanese military brothels, as so-called \\"comfort women\\".Comfort Women Were 'Raped': U.S. Ambassador to Japan. chosun.com. March 19, 2007 French Moroccan troops known as Goumiers committed rapes and other war crimes after the Battle of Monte Cassino. (See Marocchinate.) French women in Normandy complained about rapes during the liberation of Normandy. Rapes were committed by Wehrmacht forces on Jewish women and girls during the Invasion of Poland in September 1939; they were also committed against Polish, Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian women and girls during mass executions which were primarily carried out by the Selbstschutz units, with the assistance of Wehrmacht soldiers who were stationed in territory that was under the administration of the German military; the rapes were committed against female captives before they were shot. Only one case of rape was prosecuted by a German court during the military campaign in Poland, and even then the German judge found the perpetrator guilty of Rassenschande (committing a shameful act against his race as defined by the racial policy of Nazi Germany), rather than rape. Jewish women were particularly vulnerable to rape during The Holocaust. Rapes were also committed by German forces stationed on the Eastern Front, where they were largely unpunished (as opposed to rapes committed in Western Europe) Wehrmacht also established a system of military brothels, in which young women and girls from occupied territories were forced into prostitution under harsh conditions. In the Soviet Union women were kidnapped by German forces for prostitution as well; one report by the International Military Tribunal writes \\"in the city of Smolensk the German Command opened a brothel for officers in one of the hotels into which hundreds of women and girls were driven; they were mercilessly dragged down the street by their arms and hair.\\" Rapes happened under occupied territories by the Red Army. A female Soviet war correspondent described what she had witnessed: \\"The Russian soldiers were raping every German female from eight to eighty. It was an army of rapists.\\" According to German historian Miriam Gebhardt, as many as 190,000 women were raped by U.S. soldiers in Germany. According to researcher and author Kriszti√°n Ungv√°ry, some 38,000 civilians were killed during the Siege of Budapest: about 13,000 from military action and 25,000 from starvation, disease and other causes. Included in the latter figure are about 15,000 Jews, largely victims of executions by Hungarian Arrow Cross Party militia. When the Soviets finally claimed victory, they initiated an orgy of violence, including the wholesale theft of anything they could lay their hands on, random executions and mass rape. An estimated 50,000 women and girls were raped,\\"The worst suffering of the Hungarian population is due to the rape of women. Rapes‚Äîaffecting all age groups from ten to seventy are so common that very few women in Hungary have been spared.\\" Swiss embassy report cited in Ungv√°ry 2005, p.350. (Krisztian Ungvary The Siege of Budapest 2005) although estimates vary from 5,000 to 200,000. Hungarian girls were kidnapped and taken to Red Army quarters, where they were imprisoned, repeatedly raped and sometimes murdered.

Part of the lake is in the North Carolina counties of Halifax, Northampton, and Warren. The part extending into Virginia lies in Brunswick and Mecklenburg counties. Lake Gaston is roughly long and covers over , with of shoreline. The area surrounding the lake is home to more than 150,000 residents. The nearest towns are Littleton and Roanoke Rapids in North Carolina, and Clarksville and South Hill in Virginia. The lake is not federally owned. It was formed when the Virginia Electric Power Company (VEPCO) built Gaston Dam on the Roanoke River to generate electricity for Dominion Resources, which owns the lake. The dam is located on the North Carolina side and generates electricity for Dominion North Carolina Power, which is the North Carolina operating company of Dominion Resources. The dam includes four hydroelectric generators, with a total generating capacity of 224 megawatts. Lake Gaston, fed by water from Kerr Lake upstream, and supplies water to Roanoke Rapids Lake downstream, a smaller predecessor to Lake Gaston. One of the few areas in the country with three hydroelectric dams in close proximity to one another. Lake Gaston has long been famous for fishing and other water recreations. The lake is a favorite vacation spot because it is close to the Research Triangle region of North Carolina, I-85, and I-95. Lake Gaston, built for flood control, hydroelectric power, and recreational enjoyment, includes such activities as fishing, boating, swimming, water skiing, and wakeboarding.  Lake level and water management  Sunrise over Lake Gaston Lake Gaston differs from many other lakes in that the water levels are strictly regulated through a license with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The license also requires cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the upstream feeder lake, Lake Kerr. There are four defined operating conditions for Lake Gaston: * Normal: of elevation * Fish Spawning: of elevation * Flood Control: up to of elevation ( possible in a 100-year flood event) * Drought: No lower than feet of elevation As a result of controlled lake levels, fixed docks and boathouses are normal on Lake Gaston.  Lakeside residences  = Community association = The Lake Gaston Association (LGA) is a citizens' organization that actively advocates and promotes the interests of households and businesses who own property in the two states and five counties encompassing Lake Gaston. Each of the five counties surrounding Lake Gaston has four volunteer Director positions on the LGA Board, plus one at-large position, for a total of 25 Directors. It is a volunteer, non-profit, nonpartisan, and nonsectarian organization, unified for more significant influence with federal, state, local officials, and agencies that have management authority on and around Lake Gaston. = Real estate = Lake Gaston covers an extended geographical area and is bordered by several towns. Real estate is generally broken up via quadrant, and realtors will use the terms \\"South-East\\", \\"South-West\\", \\"North-East\\", and \\"North-West\\" when discussing general location of a property on the lake. = Waterfront construction authority = Generally speaking, no individual owns waterfront property on Lake Gaston. Dominion Power owns the lake and lands up to the \\"High Water Mark.\\" Real estate, listed with an indicator, tells the buyer how many linear feet of property they would potentially own that abuts to the High Water Mark. This number used to be referred to as the \\"HWM\\" on real estate listings, and is now referred to as \\"DOM\\".

She abandoned her career on the stage after becoming the mistress of Victor Hugo, to whom she acted as a secretary and travelling companion. Juliette accompanied Hugo in his exile to the Channel Islands, and wrote thousands of letters to him throughout her life. Childhood and early years She was born Julienne Josephine Gauvain on 10 April 1806 in Foug√®res, Ille-et- Vilaine, the daughter of Julien Gauvain, a tailor, and Marie Marchandet, who was employed as a housemaid. She had two older sisters, Renee and Th√©r√®se, and a brother Armand.Pascale Lafargue, Juliette une destin√©√®, p.64, Google Books, retrieved 19 October 2009 Orphaned from her mother a few months after her birth, and her father the following year, Gauvain was raised by her uncle, Ren√© Drouet. She was educated in Paris at a religious boarding school and considered a precocious child, having learned to read and write at the age of five. At the age of ten, Gauvain was already proficient in literature and poetry. Around 1825, she became the mistress of sculptor James Pradier, who represented her in a statue symbolizing Strasbourg, at the Place de la Concorde in Paris. They had a daughter together, Claire. On the advice of Pradier, she started an acting career in 1829, initially in Brussels, then in Paris. It was about that time Gauvain began using her uncle's surname, Drouet. Life as a courtesan Described by those who knew her as independent, impulsive and hot-tempered; she was also regarded by Parisian society as a typical courtesan who dressed splendidly, spent money wildly, and was extremely beautiful. Drouet had limpid, bright eyes; a fine, chiseled nose; a small, crimson mouth; set in an oval face, framed by a mass of blue-black hair. Victor Hugo In 1833, while playing the role of Princess N√©groni in Lucrezia Borgia (play) (see: Lucrezia Borgia), she met Victor Hugo, whose wife Ad√®le was having an affair with the critic Sainte-Beuve. She abandoned her theatrical career afterwards to dedicate her life to her lover. Her last stage role was of Lady Jane Grey in Hugo's Marie Tudor. She became Hugo's secretary and travelling companion. For many years she lived a cloistered life, leaving home only in his company. In 1852, she accompanied him in his exile on Jersey, and then in 1855 on Guernsey. She wrote thousands of letters to him throughout her life, which testify to her writing talent according to Henri Troyat who wrote her biography in 1997. Each year, from 16 February 1833 to 1883, they celebrated the anniversary of the first night they had spent together.Hugo, Victor, Choses vues, 1870-1885, Gallimard, 1972, , p. 515. Victor Hugo even slipped this personal anecdote into the plot of Les Mis√©rables: Marius and Cosette‚Äôs wedding night takes place on the same date.(Part V, Book 6, Chapter 1) Juliette Drouet died in Paris on 11 May 1883 at the age of 77.

Nearly all of it is under cultivation with viticulture being the main economic activity, and several well-established Swan Valley wineries are based here. Its local government area is the City of Swan. History The name Baskerville was given by William Tanner, a prominent Perth citizen and landowner, to Swan Location 5 when he took up a grant there in 1831. He never lived on the properties, however, and left the Swan River Colony in 1835. In the 1880s, the land was acquired by Walter Padbury, who employed his relative, Henry Hardwick, to manage it. In 1886 a homestead was built for him on what is now Memorial Avenue in the west of the suburb. After World War I, the Government decided to commence a soldier resettlement scheme in the Swan Valley region, and subdivided it into lots of about 10-50 acres which would be operated as small farms. However, many of the soldiers had no agricultural experience, and sold the land to new migrants, particularly those from Yugoslavia and Italy who had experience in viticulture. A 1953 map by a CSIRO viticultural expert shows nearly all of Baskerville was used for grape growing, with some citrus orchards on the riverfront near what is now Amiens Crescent..

The Beginnings (Legends and Lies)  David von Beck formed the Straw Dogs as an outlet for his shimmering, mellow country rock. Legends & Lies (1998) was recorded (and toured) with the band's original line-up. After touring the United States as a full band in support of the group's debut, Legends & Lies, von Beck pared Straw Dogs down to a simple duo, initiating the help of his old friend Darren Smith from the Colorado- based Stranger Neighbor. Darren Smith agreed to join his friend. After Smith joined Straw Dogs, the band has enjoyed moderate success.  Any Place At All  Any Place At All was the band's first album recorded with Darren Smith. The 2001 album is often publicised and referred to as the band's debut. The songs on Any Place At All earned von Beck and Smith 4 Billboard songwriting awards and the opening slot on the Crash Test Dummies final tour. Songs from the album found its way onto AAA and college radio, and won first place in the KZOK (Seattle) talent contest. The song ‚ÄúAll My Days‚Äù has been played over 1 million times at mp3.com.  Hum Of The Motor  Hum of the Motor, a tribute to the open road and Americana was released on March 18, 2003, this time with a full band dishing out the tunes. \\"We've upped the ante,\\" said David von Beck, the band's lead vocalist and guitarist, who co-wrote all of the new songs with guitarist Darren Smith. Smith also handles backing vocals, piano, and even some bass. \\"This record is fuller, more electric. We brought in Casey Miller on drums, Dan Tyack on pedal steel and some other great players, so it has added some depth to the Straw Dogs sound.\\" The Straw Dogs' \\"second album (Legends and Lies is overlooked by the band as their first album) was a harder sell than Any Place At All.  Tell The Rising Sun  \\"Tell the Rising Sun\\" , is the band's 2005 release. The song \\"Not Gone\\" was in top rotation in Belgium. Listeners to The Mountain, 103.7 FM (Seattle) also hear tracks from the album quite often. For instance, \\"Troubles Down\\" gets regular airplay on The Mountain's Sunday Brunch. Numerous internet radio stations also broadcast the CD, including Live365, CelticRadio, Buzz Music, GarageRadio, and altcountry.nl, where the \\"Not Gone\\" was in the station's \\"Top 20\\" for January 2006. Their song, \\"Guess Again,\\" was featured in an upcoming Warren Miller Film, entitled, Hunt. They were also asked to write a song for another upcoming production entitled, Trial By Self. The song is entitled, \\"When Heaven Falls.\\"  Live Shows  As a four-piece rock outfit, Straw Dogs consistently put on live shows. In longer shows, Darren and David add an acoustic set, which gives the audience a chance to hear just voice and guitar, the root tones and clean harmony that drive this band's compositions. There are also occasional guest musicians in the line-up, including on keyboards, pedal steel, and dobro.  More About David von Beck  Straw Dogs founder David von Beck is also a plaintiff's construction-defect lawyer with Levy-von Beck and Associates. He is married to Marcie, who is an architect who traded in her 12-year career to teach fifth grade. They have 2 daughters.

It is in the City of Swan local government area. Most of the suburb is covered in native sheoak and banksia forest. A small Noongar community is based on Baal Street, a drug rehabilitation retreat is located off Gnangara Road in the suburb's northeast, and the Perth International Telecommunications Centre facility is based in the suburb's northwest.  Geography  Location of Cullacabardee (orange) within the northern suburbs of Perth. Cullacabardee is north of Perth's central business district, beyond the residential suburb of Ballajura. It covers approximately ) and its borders are Gnangara Road to the north, Alexander Drive to the west, Hennessy Road (Old Beechboro Road) to the east and Hepburn Avenue to the south. Only one public road, Baal Street, enters the locality. Much of the suburb's area, formerly owned by the Western Australian Planning Commission and known as \\"IP8 West\\", became part of Whiteman Park on 31 March 2000 and contains about of regionally significant bushland. The remaining sections are zoned General Rural under the City of Swan's 1993 Cullacabardee Rural Plan. Accessed at Battye Library, Perth. Cullacabardee is located over an unconfined aquifer known as the Gnangara Mound, a major supplier of scheme groundwater to the Perth Metropolitan Area. The area is classified as an underground Water Pollution Control Area under the Water Authority Act 1984 and a Priority 1 drinking water source by the now defunct Department of Water. A survey of soils in the area in April 1999 indicated that Cullacabardee's soil is located in the Bassendean Sand soil association, and is a leached white siliceous sand of mineral quartz, with negligible phosphorus retention capability. Vegetation is mainly low woodland forests of sheoak and banksia, with scattered jarrah.  Cullacabardee Aboriginal community  Banksia forest in western Cullacabardee. The community at Cullacabardee consisting of 30 units set in 40 hectares of bushland has existed since about 1980, and was designed for four different groups who the Western Australian Government perceived to be \\"having difficulty surviving in suburbia\\" and who would otherwise be homeless. Families were first moved into the homes on 8 October 1980 (46 pages) and the Cullacabardee Aboriginal Corporation was registered and incorporated on 21 March 1984 under paragraph 45(1) of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976, and is vested in the Aboriginal Lands Trust. The community's housing is managed by the state's Department of Housing, but local programs and maintenance are managed by the Aboriginal Corporation and funded by federal and state governments. = Alleged problems = Some discussion in local media has focussed on alleged problems within the community. In 1999, The Australian reported that many of Cullacabardee's residents were unemployed, had no public transport despite 20 years of State Government management and no access to jobs, shops, education or health services. The article noted that \\"residents have to walk up to along a dangerously busy road or through a bush track to reach a shop or bus stop\\", and that the nearest primary school is away. Nine derelict homes in the community were being refurbished under a training scheme to assist young community members to gain skills, although the community claimed that funding was only available for 12-month periods, making apprenticeships (which run for several years) impossible to offer. A review report into the community in 2000 identified these and other issues such as the land being zoned General Rural, effectively prohibiting residential development, and the illegal dumping of concrete demolition rubble and other refuse near the community. In 2003, a series of articles in The West Australian newspaper claimed that gun violence, threats to women and children and other social problems were widespread at Cullacabardee and at similar camps at Gnangara and at Saunders Street, Henley Brook, and reported some residents' criticism of the community's long-time manager, Ivy Quartermaine. Reporting to a government select committee into the operation of the reserves later the same year, Homeswest director Greg Joyce defended Quartermaine: \\"She has done her best over a long time to run the place. One of the dilemmas we always get involved with is that when families are dysfunctional in the normal community, the tendency is for the system to ask Mrs Quartermaine to take them.\\" He said the department were \\"legitimately ambivalent\\" towards the future of the camp. A press report in The Australian newspaper in August 2006, which also noted the passing of Mrs Quartermaine, suggested that following the withdrawal of funding by the Federal Government, which had provided most of the Corporation's income since 1997, the state's Department of Housing and Works intended to close the camp down and relocate the 15 families still resident in the village to \\"better housing in suburban Perth\\". However, there has been no mention of the community in Hansard since 2004, and the Department of Housing and Works's website does not mention any impending action.  Perth International Telecommunications Centre  The site was originally home to a radio station which was used until 1986 by the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC), one of two entities which later merged and formed the Telstra telecommunications company. Most government agencies refer to the site's location as Landsdale or Landsdale-Gnangara. In July 1984, an international meeting agreed to construct an undersea cable between Jakarta, Singapore and Perth, spanning and connecting with cable systems in Malaysia, the Philippines, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The Perth International Telecommissions Centre (PITC) commenced operations in November 1986. To this day, it handles a large percentage of Telstra's satellite communications. Recent debate in the community and in State and Federal parliaments has focussed on residential development near the previously isolated site. The PITC had maintained for many years that there should be a buffer surrounding its land in which no residential development should occur, and from the mid-1990s onwards, several members of parliament for the area tried to resolve this issue on behalf of neighbouring landowners. Some Landsdale residents in the already-developed section had also complained that the PITC facility interfered with their domestic appliances. In October 2005, the WA Planning Commission presented Metropolitan Region Scheme Amendment 1089/33 to the Western Australian parliament, which was approved and took effect from 2 April 2006. The amendment rezoned an area known as East Landsdale Precinct 64, west of Alexander Drive, from rural to urban. In August 2006, Wanneroo City Council, the local government area responsible for Landsdale, submitted corresponding changes to the District Plan for approval. It is unknown at this time whether PITC will eventually have to relocate as a medium-to-long-term result of the rezoning.  Other facilities  = Cyrenian House residential program = Cyrenian House, the trading arm of WA Council on Addictions Inc, is a non-government, not-for-profit organisation specialising in treatment of drug and alcohol addictions and is based in North Perth. They operate two facilities off Gnangara Road in Cullacabardee, both of which were established in 1991 - the Rick Hammersley Centre, a therapeutic community where residents spend 10 weeks, followed by a two-week community re-entry skills development program, and the Saranna women's program, a residential village for women affected by addictive or compulsive behaviour and their children, where residents spend a minimum of three months and also receive assistance for re- entry into the general community. = Transport = Cullacabardee is not served by public transport.

The Canadian system is designed to cover only Canadian soils. The Canadian system dispenses with the sub-order hierarchical level. Solonetzic and Gleysolic soils are differentiated at the order level. History Before 1955, Canadian soil testing was based on systems of classification which were similar to methods being used in the United States. In 1955, a taxonomic system of soil classification specific to Canadian conditions was introduced. This system was designed differentiate soils created by pedogenic processes in cool climatic environments. Classification process The land area of Canada (excluding inland waters) is approximately 9 180 000 km2, of which about 1 375 000 km2 (15%) is rock land. The remainder is classified according to the Canadian System of Soil Classification. This system differentiates soil types on the basis of measured properties of the profile and uses a hierarchical scheme to classify soils from general to specific. The most recent version of the classification system has five categories in its hierarchical structure. From general to specific, the major categories in this system are: Orders, Great Groups, Subgroups, Families, and Series. Soil classes are defined as specifically as possible to permit uniformity of classification. Limits between classes are arbitrary as there are few sharp divisions of the soil continuum in nature. Differences in soils are the result of the interaction of many factors: climate, organisms, parent material, relief and time. The soil classification system changes as knowledge grows through soil mapping and research in Canada and elsewhere. Classification involves arranging individual units with similar characteristics into groups. Soils do not occur as discrete entities; thus the unit of measurement for soil is not obvious. This unit of measurement is called the pedon, defined as a 3-dimensional body, commonly with lateral dimensions of 1 metre and depth of 1 to 2 metres. A vertical section of a pedon displays the more-or-less horizontal layers (horizons) developed by the action of soil-forming processes. Soil classification facilitates the organization and communication of information about soils, as well as the understanding of relationships between soils and environmental factors. At its most general level, the Canadian System recognizes ten different Soil Orders. To classify in a soil in practice, an identification key in The Canadian System of Soil Classification is used. Decisions are made based on the properties of the horizons, such as thickness, Munsell colour, pH, or evidence of other soil-forming processes (eg, eluviation). Orders =Cryosolic Order= These soils have permafrost (permanently frozen material) within one metre of the surface (2 m if the soil is strongly cryoturbated; i.e., disturbed by frost action). As permafrost is a barrier to roots and water, the active layer (seasonally thawed material) above it may become a saturated, semifluid material in spring. Commonly the permafrost layer near the surface contains abundant ice. Melting of ice and frozen materials, resulting from disturbance of the surface vegetation (boreal forest or tundra), may cause slumping of the soil and disruption of roads, pipelines and buildings. Cryosolic soils, occupying about 3 672 000 km2 (about 40%) of Canada's land area, are dominant in much of the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut and occur in northern areas of all but the Atlantic provinces (excluding Labrador). The order and its 3 great groups were defined in 1973, after soil and terrain surveys in the Mackenzie Valley yielded new knowledge about the properties, genesis and significance of these soils. Turbic Cryosols have a patterned surface (hummocks, stone nets, etc.) and mixed horizons or other evidence of cryoturbation. Static Cryosols lack marked evidence of cryoturbation; they are associated with sandy or gravelly materials. Organic Cryosols are composed dominantly of organic materials (e.g., peat). Because organic material acts as an insulator, Organic Cryosols occur farther south than the boundary of continuous permafrost. Organic soil monolith =Organic Order= These soils are composed predominantly of organic matter in the upper half metre (more than 30% organic matter by weight) and do not have permafrost near the surface. They are the major soils of peatlands (e.g., swamp, bog, fen). Most organic soils develop by the accumulation of plant materials from species that grow well in areas usually saturated with water. Some organic soils are composed largely of plant materials deposited in lakes; others, mainly of forest leaf litter on rocky slopes in areas of high rainfall. Organic soils cover almost 374 000 km2 (4.1%) of Canada's land area: large areas occur in Manitoba, Ontario and northern Alberta, smaller areas in other provinces and territories. Organic soils are subdivided into 4 great groups. Fibrisols, common in Canada, consist predominantly of relatively undecomposed organic material with clearly visible plant fragments; resistant fibres account for over 40% by volume. Most soils derived from Sphagnum mosses are Fibrisols. Mesisols are more highly decomposed and contain less fibrous material than Fibrisols (10-40% by volume). Humisols consist mainly of humified organic materials and may contain up to 10% fibre by volume. Folisols consist mainly of thick deposits of forest litter overlying bedrock, fractured bedrock or unconsolidated material. They occur commonly in wet mountainous areas of coastal British Columbia. Vertisol profile =Vertisolic Order= These clay-rich soils shrink and swell markedly on drying and wetting. The physical disruption associated with shrinking and swelling produces shiny shear planes (slickensides) in the subsoil and either prevents the formation of subsurface horizons or severely disrupts and mixes them. When the soil swells on wetting, the former surficial material is mixed with the subsoil. Vertisolic soils develop mainly in clayey materials in semiarid to subhumid areas of the Interior Plains of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta and occupy less than 1% of the land area of Canada. The order and its 2 great groups were recognized in the Canadian system in the 1990s after extensive studies of pedons in the Great Plains. The Vertisol great group has a light-coloured A horizon that is not readily distinguishable, and the Humid Vertisol great group has a dark-coloured A horizon enriched in organic matter that is clearly distinguishable from the underlying soil material. =Podzolic Order= Podzol soil monolith These acid soils have a B horizon containing accumulations of amorphous materials composed of humified organic matter associated with aluminum and iron. They develop most commonly in sandy materials in areas of cold, humid climate under forest or shrub vegetation. Water moving downward through the relatively porous material leaches out basic elements (e.g., calcium), and acidic conditions develop. Soluble organic substances formed by decomposition of the forest litter attack soil minerals in surface horizons, and much of the iron and aluminum released combines with this organic material. When the proportion of aluminum and iron to organic matter reaches a critical level, the organic complex becomes insoluble and is deposited in the B horizon. Dissolved aluminum and iron may also move downward in inorganic forms and be deposited as aluminum-silicon complexes and iron oxides. An Ae (light grey, strongly leached) horizon usually overlies the Podzolic B horizon. Podzolic soils occupy about 1 429 000 km2 (15.6%) of Canada's land area and are dominant in vast areas of the humid Appalachian and Canadian Shield regions and in the humid coastal region of British Columbia. They are divided among 3 great groups on the basis of the kind of Podzolic B horizon. Humic Podzols have a dark B horizon with a low iron content. They occur mainly in wet sites under humid climates and are much less common than other Podzolic soils. Ferro-Humic Podzols have a dark reddish-brown or black B horizon containing at least 5% organic carbon and appreciable amounts (often 2% or more) of aluminum and iron in organic complexes. They occur commonly in the more humid parts of the area of Podzolic soils; e.g., coastal British Columbia and parts of Newfoundland and southern Quebec. In Labrador along the Churchill River valley Ferro-Humic Podzols comprise about 36% of soils.Walker, T.R. (2012) Properties of selected soils from the sub-Arctic region of Labrador, Canada. Polish Polar Research. 33(3): doi: 10.2478/v10183‚àí012‚àí0013‚àí4. Humo- Ferric Podzols, the most common Podzolic soils in Canada, have a reddish-brown B horizon containing less than 5% organic carbon associated with aluminum and iron complexes. =Gleysolic Order= Gleysol soil monolith These soils are periodically or permanently saturated with water and depleted of oxygen. They occur commonly in shallow depressions and level areas of subhumid and humid climate in association with other classes of soil on slopes and hills. After snowmelt or heavy rains, depressions in the landscape may be flooded. If flooding occurs when the soil temperature is above approximately 5 ¬∞C, microbial activity results in depletion of oxygen within a few days. Under such conditions, oxidized soil components (e.g., nitrate, ferric oxide) are reduced. Depletion of ferric oxide removes the brownish colour common to many soils, leaving them grey. As the soil dries and oxygen re-enters, the reduced iron may be oxidized locally to bright yellow-brown spots (mottles). Thus, Gleysolic soils are usually identified by their poor drainage and drab grey colour, sometimes accompanied by brown mottles. Gleysolic soils cover about 117 000 km2 (1.3%) of Canada's land area. Three great groups of Gleysolic soils are defined. Humic Gleysols have a dark A horizon enriched in organic matter. Gleysols lack such a horizon. Luvic Gleysols have a leached (Ae) horizon underlain by a B horizon in which the clay has accumulated; they may have a dark surface horizon. =Solonetzic Order= Solonetz soil monolith These soils have B horizons that are very hard when dry, swelling to a sticky, compact mass when wet. They usually develop in saline parent materials in semiarid and subhumid regions. Properties of the B horizons are associated with sodium ions that cause the clay to disperse readily and swell on wetting, thus closing the large pores and preventing water flow. Solonetzic soils cover almost 73 000 km2 (0.7%) of Canada's land area; most occur in southern Alberta, because of the large areas of saline parent material and semiarid climate. The 4 great groups of Solonetzic soils are based on properties reflecting the degree of leaching. Solonetz soils have a dark, organic-matter- enriched A horizon overlying the Solonetzic B, which occurs usually at a depth of 20 cm or less. The Ae (grey, leached) horizon is very thin or absent. Solodized Solonetz have a distinct Ae horizon between the dark A and the Solonetzic B. Solods have a transitional AB or BA horizon formed by degradation of the upper part of the Solonetzic B horizon. Vertisolic Solonetzic soils have features intergrading the Vertisolic order in addition to any of the above Solonetzic features. The developmental sequence of Solonetzic soils is commonly from saline parent material to Solonetz, Solodized Solonetz and Solod. As leaching progresses, the salts and sodium ions are translocated downward. If leaching progresses for long enough and salts are removed completely, the Solonetzic B may disintegrate completely. The soil would then be classified in another order. Resalinization may occur and reverse the process associated with leaching. =Chernozemic Order= Chernozem soil monolith These soils have an A horizon darkened by the addition of organic matter, usually from the decay of grass roots. The A horizon is neutral to slightly acid and is well supplied with bases such as calcium. The C horizon usually contains calcium carbonate (lime); it may contain more soluble salts such as gypsum. Chernozemic soils have mean annual soil temperatures above 0 ¬∞C and occur in regions of semiarid and subhumid climates. Covering more than 4% of Canada's land area, they are the major class of soils in the southern Interior Plains, where grass is the dominant native vegetation. The 4 great groups of Chernozemic soils are distinguished based upon surface horizon colour, associated with the relative dryness of the soil. Brown soils have brownish A horizons and occur in the driest area of the Chernozemic region. Dark Brown soils have a darker A horizon than Brown soils, reflecting a somewhat higher precipitation and associated higher organic- matter content. Black soils, associated with subhumid climates and tall-grass native vegetation, have a black A horizon which is usually thicker than that of Brown or Dark Brown soils. Dark Gray soils are transitional between grassland Chernozemic soils and the more strongly leached soils of forested regions. =Luvisolic Order= Luvisol soil monolith These soils have eluvial horizons from which clay has been leached after snowmelt or heavy rains and illuvial horizons in which clay has been deposited; these horizons are designated Ae and Bt respectively. In saline or calcareous materials, clay translocation is preceded by leaching of salts and carbonates. Luvisolic soils occur typically in forested areas of subhumid to humid climate where the parent materials contain appreciable clay. Luvisolic soils cover about 809 000 km2 (8.8%) of Canada's land area. Large areas of Luvisolic soils occur in the central to northern Interior Plains; smaller areas in all regions south of the permafrost zone. The 2 great groups of Luvisolic soils are distinguished mainly on the basis of soil temperature. Gray Brown Luvisols have a dark Ah horizon in which organic matter has been mixed with the mineral material (commonly by earthworm activity), a brown, often platy eluvial horizon (Ae) and an illuvial horizon (Bt) in which blocky structure is common. Their mean annual soil temperature is 8 ¬∞C or higher. The major area of Gray Brown Luvisols is found in the southern part of the Great Lakes-St Lawrence Lowlands. Gray Luvisols have eluvial and illuvial horizons and may have an Ah horizon if the mean annual soil temperature is below 8 ¬∞C. Vast areas of Gray Luvisols in the Boreal Forest Zone of the Interior Plains have thick, light grey eluvial horizons underlying the forest litter and thick Bt horizons with clay coating the surface of aggregates. =Brunisolic Order= Brunisol soil monolith This order includes all soils that have developed B horizons but do not meet the requirements of any of the orders described previously. Many Brunisolic soils have brownish B horizons without much evidence of clay accumulation, as in Luvisolic soils, or of amorphous materials, as in Podzolic soils. With time and stable environmental conditions, some Brunisolic soils will evolve to Luvisolic soils; others, to Podzolic soils. Covering almost 790 000 km2 (8.6%) of Canada's land area, Brunisolic soils occur in association with other soils in all regions south of the permafrost zone. Four great groups are distinguished on the basis of organic matter enrichment in the A horizon and acidity. Melanic Brunisols have an Ah horizon at least 10 cm thick and a pH above 5.5. They occur commonly in southern Ontario and Quebec. Eutric Brunisols have the same basic properties as Melanic Brunisols, except that the Ah horizon, if any, is less than 10 cm thick. Sombric Brunisols have an Ah horizon at least 10 cm thick, and are acid and their pH is below 5.5. Dystric Brunisols are acidic and do not have an Ah horizon 10 cm thick. Regosol soil monolith =Regosolic Order= These soils are too weakly developed to meet the limits of any other order. The absence or weak development of genetic horizons may result from a lack of time for development or from instability of materials. The properties of Regosolic soils are essentially those of the parent material. Two great groups are defined. Regosols consist essentially of C horizons. Humic Regosols have an Ah horizon at least 10 cm thick. Regosolic soils cover about 73 000 km2 (0.8%) of Canada's land area. Subgroups, families and series =Great Group= The 31 great group classes are formed by subdividing order classes on the basis of soil properties that reflect differences in soil-forming processes (e.g., kinds and amounts of organic matter in surface soil horizons). =Subgroups= Subgroups are based on the sequence of horizons in the pedon. Many subgroups intergrade to other soil orders. For example, the Gray Luvisol great group includes 12 subgroups; Orthic Gray Luvisol is the typical expression of Gray Luvisols, and other subgroups are intergrades to the Chernozemic order (Dark Gray Luvisol), Podzolic order (Podzolic Gray Luvisol), Gleysolic order (Gleyed Gray Luvisol), Solonetzic and Gleysolic orders (Gleyed Solonetzic Gray Luvisol), etc. =Families= Families are based on parent material properties and soil climate. For example, the Orthic Gray Luvisol subgroup includes soils of a wide range of texture (gravelly sandy loam to clay), different mineralogy and different temperature and water regime. The soil family designation is much more specific; e.g., Orthic Gray Luvisol, clayey, mixed (mineralogy), cold, subhumid. =Series= Series have a vast array of properties (e.g., horizon thickness and colour, gravel content, structure) that fall within a narrow range. Thus, for example, the series name Breton implies all the basic properties of the Luvisolic order, the Gray Luvisol great group, the Orthic Gray Luvisol subgroup and the fine, loamy, mixed, cold subhumid family of that subgroup as well as series-specific properties. A series name implies so much specific information about soil properties that a wide range of interpretations can be made on the probable suitability of the soil for a variety of uses.

Presents is the umbrella title for three series that were telecast as part of the 1955-56 season on ABC: Cheyenne, a new Western series that originated on Presents, and two based on classic Warner Bros motion picture properties, becoming Casablanca (1955 TV series) and Kings Row (TV series). While neither a critical nor popular success,Warner Brothers Presents at The Museum of Broadcast Communications this wheel series is an historically important program. Perhaps most significantly, it is the first television program of any kind made by Warner Bros. It was also the original home of Cheyenne, the first hour-long television Western series and the first wholly original television series produced by a major Hollywood studio. It also allowed ABC, then a junior player in American television, to secure its first advertising contracts with commercial giants General Electric and tobacco company Liggett & Myers. Historical background At first, Warner Bros., like most other Hollywood studios, had seen television as a threat that it wished would disappear. Jack L. Warner, stung by the failure of Milton Berle's expensive film Always Leave Them Laughing Hope, Bob & Shavelson, Melville Don't Shoot, Its Only Me Putnam Adult; First edition (May 17, 1990) tried to dismiss it as a mere passing fad, but by 1955, this apparently was hardly the case. ABC, which did not have the contracts with stars and their hit former radio shows on the CBS and NBC networks approached Warner Bros. about acquiring the rights to broadcast some of its relatively recent theatrical films, which were then not available for television broadcast. Instead, Warner saw a different potential for his company, inspired by ABC's Disneyland. He believed that perhaps television could be used to cross-market upcoming Warner Bros. films. Thus, he created a television department and promoted his son-in- law, William T. Orr, to the new position of Head of Television Production. The initial goal was to provide new short fiction which they could wrap around segments hosted by actor Gig Young, giving information about upcoming Warner's film projects. Orr's first effort in that capacity was this program. Program evolution Originally, the hour-long episodes consisted of only about 45 minutes of dramatic programming, followed by a 10- to 15-minute \\"Behind the Camera\\" section. During this portion of the program, viewers saw James Dean doing rope tricks on the set of Giant, Billy Wilder and James Stewart explaining the special effects of The Spirit of St. Louis, and other notable Warner Bros. productions, including a four-part feature on the new John Ford Western The Searchers, one of the first attempts to document the making of a major Hollywood film and a similar three-part feature on the making of Helen of Troy. While completing Giant, and to promote Rebel Without a Cause, Dean filmed a short interview with Gig Young for an episode of Warner Bros. Presents in which Dean, instead of saying the popular phrase \\"The life you save may be your own\\", ad-libbed \\"The life you might save might be mine.\\" Dean's sudden death prompted the studio to refilm the section, and the piece was never aired. The problem for ABC's newly acquired advertisers was that it amounted to a 15-minute commercial for Warner Bros.' products. They had ABC exert pressure to abolish the segment before the season concluded. The concept changed in other ways as the season progressed. The dramatic portions of the program were attacked from the beginning as inept. All three series were overhauled, but only Cheyenne emerged as successful. It would have ranked in the top 20 if its ratings had been calculated independently. Despite the relative success of Cheyenne, ABC and Warner Bros. continued to have problems injecting Kings Row and Casablanca with sufficient drama. These efforts failed. Kings Row, starring Jack Kelly and Robert Horton in the roles played by Robert Cummings and Ronald Reagan in the original film, was axed within just a few weeks of its first broadcast, while Casablanca, starring Charles McGraw in the Bogart part, survived almost to the end of the season. However, when they both went, the umbrella of Warner Bros. Presents effectively closed, pushing Cheyenne out on its own. Presents was renamed Conflict by ABC and relaunched as an anthology series. Around this time, the films which inspired the Kings Row and Casablanca segments were sold, along with the rest of WB's pre-1950 theatrical library, to Associated Artists Productions.You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story (2008), p. 255.WB retained a pair of features from 1949 that they merely distributed, and all short subjects released on or after September 1, 1948; in addition to all cartoons released in August 1948. Aftermath Conflict finished the remainder of the 1955 season and continued on into 1956, but it, too, ultimately failed. By 1957, the only element remaining from the 1955 season was Cheyenne. Nevertheless, Presents may be regarded as a forerunner of an entirely new era of television ‚Äî- one in which big Hollywood studios actively made original, episodic television. It also began a long-running partnership between Warner Bros. and ABC. Over the course of the following decade, the two companies provided American viewers with a string of popular programs. The relationship pulled ABC from the bottom of the ratings and helped it avoid the fate of the other struggling 1950s broadcaster, the DuMont Network.

When Charles, an older suitor from Frances's lawn bowls group, visits that night, Frances locks the door to the boy's room while she rebuffs the man's advances until he leaves. She then inserts the diaphragm and enters the boy's room and asks him to make love to her but is distraught to find that the bed is merely stuffed with dolls. The boy sneaks back into his room at Frances's house and sleeps until the next day, when he finds that all of the doors and windows are nailed shut. He confronts Frances and she apologizes but insists that she wants things to remain as they are, leaving him locked in the house as she goes out to a bar. She notices a woman sitting alone and invites her to come spend the night with the boy but the woman becomes upset. A man overhears and helps Frances find a prostitute named Sylvia at a nearby diner. Frances brings Sylvia home and locks her in the room with the boy then listens through the door as they have intercourse. Overcome with emotion, Frances enters the room and stabs Sylvia through the heart, killing her. The boy desperately searches for an exit but Frances tells him that he can stay with her and that he does not have to be afraid. Cast Themes Writer Frank Caso identified themes of the film as including obsession, schizophrenia and personality disorder, and linked the film to director Robert Altman's later films Images (1972) and 3 Women (1977), declaring them a trilogy.

She first appeared in the story \\"Superman's Super Courtship!\\" in Action Comics No. 289 (June 1962). Fictional character biography In \\"Superman's Super Courtship\\", Supergirl tries to find a mate for the lonely Superman. After match-making attempts with Helen of Troy and an adult Saturn Girl fail, Supergirl uses the computer in the Fortress of Solitude and discovers a super-powered woman on the distant planet of Staryl named Luma Lynai. Superman flies to Staryl and the two heroes immediately fall in love. Unfortunately, Superman discovers that Luma Lynai's powers only work under the rays of an orange sun; Earth's sun yellow rays are as deadly to her as kryptonite is to Superman. Luma, realizing that Earth needs Superman, tells him he must leave. In a later reprint of the story, Luma's home star is shown as being blue, since at the time of the reprint Superman's powers were now being depicted as much weaker under an orange sun. Luma Lynai appears in Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane #97 (November 1968), along with Lori Lemaris and Lyla Lerrol.

He scored over 10,00 runs in the first-class game. Early life and career Hill was born in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire. For the first twelve years of his cricket career, he played for Nottinghamshire. His debut in the County Championship came against Hampshire in July 1953, though he did not play another first-class match until 1956. Hill's return to the game was highly successful, as he finished just short of a half century on his comeback, and helped Nottinghamshire to an eighth place in the County Championship. In the following season he became a fixture in the first-team, though Nottinghamshire's form faltered, and they finished third-bottom. They stayed at the bottom of the table in the two following seasons, although Hill maintained a quality average throughout these years. He continued to play from 1963 to 1965 for Nottinghamshire and also played for MCC in 1964. Hill then moved to Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1966. He performed in the middle order in a low-scoring victory against Surrey and was a first-choice team- member throughout the season. In the 1967 season he made only seven first- class appearances, and achieved an average of 11. Following this, he did not appear in first-class cricket for three years. In 1970 Hill was given a contract by Somerset for whom he appeared for a single season. Hill was a right-handed batsman who played in the upper-middle-order. He played 272 first-class matches with an average of 24.09 and a top score of 137 not out. He was a leg-break bowler and took five first-class wickets at an average of 62.20.Maurice Hill at Cricket Archive Hill's son, Greg, played List A cricket for Devon and Second XI cricket for, amongst other teams, Derbyshire, in the early 1990s.

It is the sole operator of the electricity sector of Equatorial Guinea. The company was created in November 2001 by a merger of the national rural electrification company SONER and the national electricity corporation ENERGE. In 2013 the company was reorganized into three units: SEGESA Comercial for distribution and sales, SEGESA Generaci√≥n for generation activities and SEGESA Transmisi√≥n for transmission. The three units are overseen by SEGESA Holding. Equatorial Guinea has two main electricity systems, for Bioko Island, and for the continental Rio Muni region. SEGESA has 730 employees across the three business units in Malabo for the Bioko system, and 823 employees in Bata and the continental region. The primary lawmaking body for national electricity policy in Equatorial Guinea is the Ministry of Industry and Energy. The Ministry is responsible for regulation and compliance in the sector. Specific laws that deal with power sector management, tariffs and operations were passed in 2002 and 2005. Private companies wishing to invest in the sector must obtain licenses from the Ministry and can enter partnerships with SEGESA.  Institutional Framework  The institutional framework for the power sector in Equatorial Guinea has a vertical structure. The Ministry of Industry and Energy defines the strategy for the power company (guided by the government's Horizon 2020 diversification plan). The ministry administers and assigns financing for projects and hands them over to SEGESA for implementation through its three business units. frameless  Organization chart of the Power Sector  Over the last decade, SEGESA and the government have implemented a range of generation, transmission and distribution projects to ensure that the country no longer suffers power outages. The power grid in Equatorial Guinea is divided in two parts: the island grid (Malabo, Bioko Island) and the continental grid (Bata, Rio Muni). The high voltage power grid in the Rio Muni region has allowed the government to invest in interconnection points with Gabon and Cameroon.  Supply and demand in Equatorial Guinea  = Bioko Island = The Bioko grid is powered by the Malabo Turbogas gas- fired power plant at Punta Europa (near Malabo) with 154.2 MW capacity. It has eight turbines: 3 x 42 MW, 2 x 10 MW, 2 x 5.2 MW and a 4 MW turbine. These supply the city of Malabo and Bioko Island via 33 kW and 66 kW transmission lines. In addition to the Punta Europa gas complex, the island has the SEMU power station that has 7.2 MW capacity (4 x 1.8 MW), the hydroelectric station at Riaba at 3 MW (2 x 1.5 MW) and the hydroelectric station at Musola. The latter two are out of service. The demand for energy on Bioko Island in 2016 was about 79 MW (7% more than the previous year‚Äôs demand). The current oversupply of electricity on the island facilitates development. = Rio Muni = The continental Rio Muni area of the country has a high-voltage grid of 220 kW, one of 110 kW and one of 20 kW, all of which are connected to the Djibloho Dam. The power plants that supply the continental region are: Djibloho hydroelectric dam at 120 MW (4 x 30 MW), the Bata diesel/fuel oil fired power plant at 24 MW (3 x 8 MW), the 'Socorro' battery storage power plant (2 x 16.4 MW), a Cummins Group thermal plant (2 x 1 MW) and the Bikomo hydro plant, which is in the process of being restored (8 x 800 kVa) Power demand in the continental area is around 65 MW and power capacity is equal to that of the insular region, meaning that it exceeds demand. In the dry season electricity production at the Djibloho plant is reduced and SEGESA is forced to cut supply. For this reason, a dam is needed to improve water flow to the Djibloho dam and increase the power of the plant. New power plant projects are underway to increase electricity availability and Equatorial Guinea has built the interconnection points that would allow it to export power to Gabon and Cameroon from Ebibey√≠n (220 kW) and Mongomo, which is 50 km from the Gabonese city of Oyem.  Ongoing and future projects  Equatorial Guinea continues to invest heavily in the production and distribution of energy. The following power projects are scheduled: Construction of the Sendje 200 MW hydro plant (4 x 50 MW) ‚Äì 2017, Construction of the Djibloho dam with two turbines of 42.5 MW - 2016, rehabilitation of Riaba Musola 1 and 2 and Bikomo hydro plants, Bata thermal plant conversion from diesel to gas, a natural gas storage area and Annobon solar micro-grid.
