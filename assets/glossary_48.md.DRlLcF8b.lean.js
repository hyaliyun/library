He was court painter to Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria for whom he realised a series of contemporary and historical portraits of members of the imperial House of Habsburg. Many of these portraits are in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum.Zehendtner, Ordenliche Beschreibung at lot-tissimo Boys was also an important witness and illustrator of key events in the life of the Habsburgs: he made the engravings for a book describing celebrations on the occasion of the grant of the Order of the Golden Fleece to leading Imperial court members and created an almost life- size depiction of a wedding banquet of a powerful aristocratic family in the service of the Imperial family. BOYS, Antoni - Painter, engraver, draughtsman in: Benezit Dictionary of ArtistsAnthoni Bays, Gartengastmahl at Schulmediencenter Life The artist was born in Antwerp, which was at the time located in the Habsburg Netherlands. The date of his birth is not known and estimates vary from to . In 1572, he became a free master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke. A knighting from the Ordentliche Beschreibung In the period from 1574 to 1576 he is believed to have traveled to Italy and Spain. Around 1575 the artist was employed by Count Jakob Hannibal I von Hohenems as a court painter.Friedrich Kenner, Die Portr√§tsammlung des Erzherzogs Ferdinand von Tirol in: Jahrbuch der Kunsthistorischen Sammlungen in Wien, 15.1894, pp. 147‚Äì259 In the period from 1579 to 1593 the artist is recorded as being active in Prague, Innsbruck and Landshut. He was appointed in 1579 as court painter to Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria and at the same time received 320 guilders for one of his works.E. Egg, Die Innsbrucker Malerei des 16 Jahrhunderts, in K. Schadelbauer, Festschrift f√ºr Karl Schadelbauer zur Vollendung des 70. Lebensjahres, Innsbruck, 1972, p. 5 It is around this time that the artist starts using the Germanised form of his name 'Anthoni (Anton) Waiss'. In 1580 Boys received a grant of arms, which conferred on him the right to bear a coat of arms or armorial bearings. He is mentioned twice as court painter in Innsbruck (in 1584 and 1586). In particular it is recorded that in 1584 he received the large sum of 1060 florins, which points to a significant activity of the artist.A. Teurlinckx, Der Coliner Kreis: aus der Geschichte der niederl√§ndischen Expansion, Bloemfontein, 1987, p. 66 John Parricida He married in 1587 with Barbara Geiger from Innsbruck and established a foundation for the poor in 1589 with a donation of 100 guilders. A record from 1589 refers to the deterioration of the health of Anton Boys and the need to find a new court painter. It is not known when or where the artist died. Estimates place his time of death between 1593 and 1603. Work =Portrait painter= Anton Boys' role as a court painter appears to have been to paint portraits of historical and living members of branches of the imperial family and their consorts. Many of these miniature portraits are now in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Anton Boys first worked on a series of Ahnenbilder (portraits of ancestors) for Count Jakob Hannibal I. His portraits were made after older originals, which explains the rather archaic style of these works. He later made a similar series of ancestor portraits for Archduke Ferdinand II. =The Ordentliche Beschreibung= Boys is believed to have been the author of the engravings illustrating a book that appeared in 1587 in Dillingen an der Donau.

It provides a detailed description of the ceremonies and festivities held in Prague and Landshut on the occasion of the grant of the Order of the Golden Fleece to Emperor Rudolph II, the Archdukes Karl and Ernst, and some other princes and noblemen.Golden Fleece - Zehendter von Zehendtgrueb, Paul at Sotheby's For the purpose of the grant of the Order, the whole court went on a journey from Innsbruck over Prague and Landshut and then to Munich and back. The book does not only describe each stop on the trip, but also all the members of the great entourage, including the author Zehendter von Zehendtgrueb and the artist Anton Boys. Anton Boys had been commissioned to illustrate the volume with folding plates of the events. These folding plates show cavalry battles, ritual ceremonies, celebrations of mass, processions, banquets, table decorations, gun practice and fireworks. In some copies these plates are coloured. Boys also made the single-page plates, which depict the insignia of the order, a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in full regalia and a series of armorial crests. Of the known copies of this book, some contain 17 plates. A copy in the Ornamentstichsammlung Berlin is incomplete and has only 12 plates. Only a few copies of the book are known to exist. =The Banquet of the Hohenems family= In 1578 count Jakob Hannibal I von Hohenems commissioned Anton Boys to paint the so-called Banquet of the Hohenems family (known in German as the Hohenemser Festtafel). The occasion of the banquet was the wedding of Duchess Margaretha von Hohenems with Fortunat Freiherr zu Madruz (Fortunato Madruzzo). Even though the painting purports to represent an historical dinner party, it includes members of several generations of the family some of whom had already passed away at the time of the wedding. Its meaning and purpose therefore extend beyond the recording of an actual event. Rather, the arrangement of the figures around the table and the iconography of gestures reveal a political and dynastic message and showcase the success of the Hohenems family, which included many prominent personalities.Diane H. Bodart, Le banquet des Habsbourg, ou la politique √† table in: Predella journal of visual arts, n¬∞33, 2013 Banquet of the Hohenems family Count Jakob Hannibal I was a scion of a very powerful family and his mother Clara (or Chiara) de' Medici was a sister of Pope Pius IV.Entry on Mark Sittich von Hohenems in the Biographical Dictionary of the Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church The count himself was an important military leader, who was in the service of the Habsburgs and was also the head of the Vatican army.Ludwig Welti, Hohenems, Jakob Hannibal in: Neue Deutsche Biographie 9 (1972), p. 480 The Banquet of the Hohenems family shows all the important members of the host's family and some of his friends sitting at a festive table, which is placed in the park of a Renaissance palace. A total of 24 persons are sitting at the banquet table, not all of whom have been identified. In the background an idealized mountain landscape is visible. The painting is of a large size at 210 cm in height and 542 cm in width. This size allowed the artist to depict the persons in the scene at half their real-life size. The persons who sit at the first row of the table all have their heads turned sideways so that they can be recognized from their profile. The count, wearing a black hat, sits on the right side of the table facing the viewer. On his left is his brother Mark Sittich, a powerful Cardinal in Rome and the Bishop of Constance. Hortensia Borromea, the wife of count Jakob Hannibal, is depicted on the left side of Mark Sittich. Opposite them is the count's cousin Cardinal Carlo Borromeo, a leading figure in the Counter-Reformation who was later beatified by the Catholic church.\\"St. Charles Borromeo Archbishop, Cardinal\\", Lives of the Saints, John J. Crowley & Co., Inc. Carlo Borromeo was also the half-brother of the count's wife.Martha Schad, Die Frauen des Hauses Fugger von der Lilie (15.-17. Jahrhundert): Augsburg, Ortenburg, Trient, Volume 31, Mohr Siebeck, 1989, p. 139 The count has just offered his brother Mark Sittich a small round fruit, which his brother has accepted and is holding pinned on the table with his left index finger. The gesture shows the close relationship between the brothers. Another intimate scene is played out at the center of the table where the wedding couple is sitting: the bridegroom Fortunat Freiherr zu Madruz has pierced with his knife tip a pear that his bride Margaretha von Hohenems (the sister of the host) retains with her hand on her plate. The Count's mother Clara de Medici is shown in the center of the picture wearing a black mourning dress, apparently mourning her own death since she had already died at the time when the wedding banquet took place. In addition to the guests the painting also depicts the servants, musicians and even the court jester who is shown at the right end of the table wearing a yellow cap and holding a goblet. The painting shows the end of the meal as the table is full of raised bowls filled with fruit, candied fruit and confectionery, which were only eaten as desert by wealthy families.Bernd Michael Andressen, Barocke Tafelfreuden: Tischkultur an Europas H√∂fen, Orbis, 2001, p. 39 In the foreground, the sommelier is busy filling the drinking goblets in gilt silver, protected by a lid. The cup bearers subsequently carry the goblets to the guests who have asked for them. The painting forms an important document on the count's family, which played such an influential role in Central Europe at that time. It also provides some insights into various aspects of that time's culture. For instance, only one person is seen using a fork at the table, an indication that the use of forks was not widespread at the time.Roman Sandgruber, Frauensachen - M√§nnerdinge: eine \\"s√§chliche\\" Geschichte der zwei Geschlechter, Ueberreuter, 2006, p. 265 References External links * Category:Flemish Renaissance painters Category:Flemish genre painters Category:Flemish portrait painters Category:Flemish engravers Category:People from Antwerp Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:16th-century engravers ","title":"Anton Boys"},{"id":"53541950","text":"Kurnool Ultra Mega Solar Park is a solar park spread over a total area of in Panyam mandal of Kurnool district, Andhra Pradesh, with a capacity of 1,000 MW.

Solar power developers invested , while the remaining was funded by APSPCL supported by a grant from the Union Government.  Description  The Kurnool Solar Park is spread over a total area of in the Gani and Sakunala villages of Kurnool district. The region is arid. The park utilizes over 4 million solar panels with capacities of 315 and 320 Watts. The panels are connected to four 220/33 kV pooling stations of 250 MW each and a 400 / 220kV grid substation through nearly 2,000 circuit kilometres of cables. During a sunny day, the Kurnool Solar Park is able to generate more than 8 million kWh of electricity, which is sufficient to meet virtually the entire electricity demand in Kurnool district.  Auction and commissioning  NTPC Limited invited bids from solar power developers for the first phase of the park on 29 April 2015, and the second phase on 21 May 2015. In total, NTPC auctioned 1,000 MW of capacity through a reverse auction. The contracts were awarded to solar power developers in mid- December 2015. 500 MW was awarded to SunEdison (as a part of bankruptcy acquired by Greenko) and 350 MW to Softbank Energy (both at rate INR 4.63/kW), 100 MW to Azure Power and 50 MW to Adani Power (at rates of INR 5.12/kWh & INR 5.13/kWh respectively). 350 MW capacity was commissioned on 29 March 2017 by Softbank Energy. Azure Power had begun construction of 100 MW capacity at the park in December 2016, and commissioned the plant by 13 June 2017. The commissioning of 100 MW by Azure Power takes the generating capacity of the park to 950 MW, which made it the largest solar park in the world, at the time. The solar park was damaged by a gale and thunderstorm in Kurnool district on 7 May 2017. Strong winds uprooted some solar panels installed by Softbank and Greenko, and also damaged staff quarters and workers facilities. The damage to the solar park caused by the extreme weather was estimated at . The remaining 50 MW capacity had been awarded to Prayatna Developers, a subsidiary of Adani Power. The company commissioned 30 MW of capacity at the park on 28 June and the remaining 20 MW in July 2017. Over 2,500 skilled and unskilled workers were employed to construct the Kurnool Ultra Mega Solar Park.

Constitutional structure  Prior to 2010 the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan did not explicitly recognize citizens‚Äô right to access information as it states that \\"every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression, and there shall be freedom of the press, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law‚Äù. As Pakistan signed the International Covenant for Civil and Political rights (ICCR), it was required to incorporate a right to information in its legal structure. The right to access information added to the Constitution by the 18th Amendment, which declared that under Article 19-A ‚ÄúEvery citizen shall have the right to have access to information in all matters of public importance subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions imposed by law.‚Äù Both federal and provincial governments issued various laws in order to allow Pakistani citizens to exercise their right to access public data.  History  Pakistan was the first South Asian country to enact a law on freedom of information, when it passed the Freedom of Information (FOI) Ordinance at the Federal level in 1997. This Ordinance was later revoked and a new Freedom of Information Ordinance was issued in 2002, which has a legal status to this day as it was covered under the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. In 2004, the Freedom of Information Rules 2004 were enforced by the Federal Government, which described the procedural aspect of the Freedom of Information Ordinance. In 2016, a draft of a new federal Right to Information (RTI) bill was proposed by Pakistan's federal government in hopes of replacing the Freedom of Information Ordinance of 2002, but the approval of the bill is still pending.  Federal  The FOI Ordinance authorizes Pakistani citizens to gain access to data held by the national government. The Ordinance only pertains to the Federal Government organizations and does not apply to any provincial governments or private entities funded by the national government. The Freedom of Information Rules 2004 details the procedure through which the governmental data can be requested: applicants must pay a fee and enclose the purpose of their inquiry by providing specific reasons as to why they need the information. If the requested information is not provided in 21 days, the applicant may file a complaint to the head of the public body. Only access to public records is permitted, which excludes such documents as notes, timings of meetings, personal bank account data, classified information, data pertaining to national security, etc. The draft of the federal RTI bill is not significantly different from the FOI Ordinance of 2004, however, it has a change in scope as the new bill is not restricted to only governmental organizations, but it also applies to non-governmental bodies that are funded or registered by the national government.  Provincial  The FOI Ordinance of 2004 laid the basis for the following two provincial laws: The Baluchistan Freedom of Information Act in 2005 and Sindh Freedom of Information Act in 2006. In addition, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Right to Information Act (KPK RTI) and the Punjab Transparency and Right to Information Ordinance were both passed in 2013. The KPK RTI Act covers not only official governmental bodies, but also non-governmental entities that are funded by the government (for example, locally funded public service organizations). The Punjab RTI Act can be used not only by the citizens of Pakistan, but also by legal bodies that are registered within Pakistan territorial borders. Sindh repealed and replaced its 2006 Act a decade later with the Sindh Transparency and Right to Information Act, 2016.

In January 2017, Hawley said he was open to continuing the story past the first season, but didn't want the audience to get to the end of the first run and have \\"no resolution of any kind at the end of it.\\" Star Dan Stevens said, \\"I know for a fact that there are more issues that David has to deal with than the one that we really address in the first season.\\" FX renewed Legion for a second season on March 15, 2017. At the end of that month, Hawley explained that he planned for the season to have ten episodes, and to focus more on the series' other characters in addition to David Haller. He added, \\"I do tend to think that that's important, that even though the show isn't an anthology like Fargo, each season has a self- contained-ness to it, an identity to it. But I think it's a little too early to talk about what that identity might be.\\" The season order was later expanded to eleven episodes, as announced by FX in May. =Writing= Hawley noted that the first season was about Haller's internal struggle against the Shadow King, and that the latter's transference to the character Oliver Bird at the end of the season signified a change to an external struggle for Haller that this season would explore. Hawley wanted to avoid having a villain-of- the-year structure, with the second season introducing a new antagonist, instead wanting to continue the story surrounding the Shadow King from his introduction in the first season that \\"makes for a potential showdown that we're really invested in as an audience\\". Hawley added that with the Shadow King reveal at the end of the first season, Haller can now blame \\"every bad thing he's ever done on the entity that's now gone, and now is thinking, 'I'm just a purely good person'... there's sort of a hubris to that.\\" Stevens said that \\"we haven't even really scratched the surface of the number of characters or entities that are contained within [Haller]. The Shadow King was obviously one of them, and a large part, but there's a lot more going on.\\" Hawley did not have a plan for the second season when he ended the first on a cliffhanger, and enjoyed the challenge of developing the story from that point, noting that this was the first \\"true\\" second season he has created. Hawley did not have to repeat this at the end of the second season, as he had a plan for future seasons by that point. The second season begins a year after the end of the first, with Hawley feeling the time jump allowed them to \\"muddy the waters\\" rather than be \\"all clarity all the time\\", since \\"that's the fun of the show, the mystery of trying to figure things out.\\" Stevens added that \\"everybody's going to be playing catchup\\", including the audience and Haller. Hawley also said that the season would explore the world of heroes and villains, and that it was not yet decided which direction Haller would go. The season spends more time inside the minds of the characters and in the Astral Plane than the first, and also explores \\"more specific genres and storytelling moments\\" to both be more ambitious than the first season and not repeat what had been done before; Hawley wanted to \\"use the genre to solve the characters ... to explore the characters and stories that you couldn't in a straight drama\\". The main story of the season focuses on Farouk searching for his original body, since mutant abilities are genetic and being reunited with the body will make him even more powerful. The season includes some episodes that Hawley considered \\"more stand-alone\\", that are still relevant to the plot of the season but were less interested in the plot and more character-focused. This was something Hawley had not been comfortable doing during the first season due to introducing the \\"different than everything else\\"-series to audiences then. To avoid the season becoming \\"a good versus evil or white hat versus black hat situation\\", Hawley wanted to focus on thematic ideas such as \\"our shared reality being a choice that we make. Sometimes societies go a little bit crazy. How does that happen?\\" To help explore that idea, Hawley created an \\"educational segment\\" which he soon decided to add to each episode of the season. The segments are narrated, and are intended to \\"take these concepts of mental illness, and visualizing them in a way where you can tell a story.\\" =Casting= Returning from the first season to star are Stevens as David Haller, Rachel Keller as Sydney \\"Syd\\" Barrett, Aubrey Plaza as Lenny Busker, Bill Irwin as Cary Loudermilk, Jeremie Harris as Ptonomy Wallace, Amber Midthunder as Kerry Loudermilk, and Jean Smart as Melanie Bird. Hawley considered Barrett to be the co-protagonist of the season alongside Haller, calling it a \\"two-hander\\", with the season further exploring their relationship and comparing it to that of Melanie Bird and her husband Oliver. Hamish Linklater joins the main cast, having portrayed Clark Debussy in a guest role in the first season. With the end of the first season establishing the importance of Jemaine Clement's character Oliver Bird, now the host of the villainous Shadow King, Hawley said that he had talked to the actor about the next season, and that he was \\"excited to come back\\". Clement's return was confirmed in July 2017, also being promoted to the main cast, along with the announcement that Sa√Ød Taghmaoui had been cast as the true form of the Shadow King / Amahl Farouk, succeeding Plaza who played the character using the appearance and persona of Busker in the first season. In November, during production on the season, Taghmaoui announced that he was no longer involved with the series, and FX confirmed that \\"a decision was made to recast\\" the role of Farouk. Navid Negahban was revealed to have taken over the role in January 2018. Hawley explained that Taghmaoui had not been \\"a great fit\\", leading to the recast. Negahban joins the main cast as well. Jon Hamm narrates the educational segments throughout the season. Hawley did not want the narration to feel \\"tainted\\" by having one of the series' characters give their own point of view, and wanted an actor who could give \\"a sense of identity and a feeling of control [as if] the show itself has a point of view and it's all going somewhere\\". He compared the voice that he wanted for the narration to Alec Baldwin's from the film The Royal Tenenbaums, and considered Hamm‚Äîwho he thought had \\"a great voice\\"‚Äîafter working with him on the film Pale Blue Dot. Hamm agreed to take on the role, and Hawley thought he gave the segments \\"such character\\", comparing the final performance to Rod Serling. Hawley added that he was \\"pretty confident\\" the actor would only be providing his voice to the series rather than ever appearing onscreen. Quinton Boisclair was confirmed to be returning as the Devil with the Yellow Eyes in July 2017. Katie Aselton also returns from the first season in a recurring role as David's sister Amy, before her body is infused with Busker's DNA allowing that character to return to life. =Design= New costume designer Robert Blackman continued the theme of mixing 60s and modern-day fashion. While each character's outfits were updated, the color palette for each character mainly stayed the same: Barrett wears orange and black in addition to yellow (with Keller saying black represents her character's \\"protective barrier\\"); and both Cary and Kerry Loudermilk wear navy and tan. Notable changes include: Melanie Bird's style changing to comfort clothing to portray her mourning in Oliver Bird; Wallace's suits featuring more color and floral designs at times; Busker's swimsuits showing how the character is being used and abused by the Shadow King; and Farouk sporting three-piece suits. Haller's style becomes more British punk, drawing inspirations from Sid Vicious and Johnny Rotten to portray a character coming from one mental institution to another. The season also moves Haller's hair closer to its unique look from the comics, with Stevens saying \\"it creeps ever higher\\". To create the sound of teeth chattering, for the people afflicted with the Catalyst mental virus, Hawley allowed sound supervisor Nick Forshager experiment with different approaches. Simply recording the actors on set chattering their teeth \\"didn't have that biting sound that we really needed\\", so they experimented with alternative sounds like horse hooves. They ultimately found that any sound they produced close to teeth chattering came across as fake teeth, so they tried recording the teeth of the sound department's staff in different ways. The final version used in the series was recorded with a Neumann condenser microphone and then digitally manipulated to give it a \\"kind of eerie multilevel sound\\". Production designer Michael Wylie worked to continue the \\"all time\\" setting of the series in the second season, taking inspiration from styles and architecture across decades so as not to make the show appear as if it takes place in a specific time or place. Because much of the season takes place in Division 3 headquarters, Wylie wanted to clearly distinguish the sets from those used for Summerland in the first season by changing a recurring motif: circles were used a lot throughout the designs of the first season, and hexagons are throughout the season two sets. He thought this added some \\"familiarity\\" to the sets and made things \\"easier to design, and we also know that whenever you see a hexagon that you know you are in Division 3 without anyone having to tell you\\". Because of the tendency for a government facility to become \\"unbearably sterile\\", Wylie looked to add depth to the sets with custom-made wall paper and complicated floor designs which did not go so far as to make the spaces feel personalized. The robot- like Vermillion that Division 3 leader Admiral Fukyama communicates through have feminine physiques and mustaches. They went through several variations, with Hawley wanting their look to be based on Dennis Franz. The set in which the Admiral and the Vermillion are introduced was initially going to look like a larger version of the wicker basket that Fukyama wears. The Division 3 dining hall is based on Hawley's idea of a \\"sushi-go-round\\" restaurant but with the food on boats floating in water, with Wylie's final design labelled a \\"1970s Italian waterpark version\\". The water for the boats zig-zags through the set, causing issues for the crew trying to maneuver around the room. Also built was Cary Loudermilk's \\"lair\\", the series' take on a traditional superhero lab, which includes an \\"amplification chamber\\" that is an homage to the machine Cerebro that appears in the comics and films. It is based on research into isolation tanks rather than any designs originating in the comics to prevent the series from simply copying what came before. =Filming= For the season, Hawley looked to move production of the show from Vancouver to California to better accommodate his busy schedule. This was made possible when the show was awarded over $11 million in tax incentives by the California Film Commission under its \\"Program 2.0\\" initiative. Hawley called this change of locale \\"another way that we helped the show not settle into a sort of familiar routine of standing sets and that sort of overly familiar sense of it's the same thing, week in and week out.\\" He added, \\"I'm going to try and look at southern California in a way that we haven't looked at before, to try and find a way to tell stories that are urban and rural and in the astral plane as it were, and continue to look like nothing else.\\" Filming began on September 28, 2017. The opening sequence of the season was filmed in the backyard of a Hollywood Hills home, in the sun, clearly establishing the different setting from the overcast locations of the first season. As with the first season, Hawley was committed to emphasizing practical effects when creating the season's visuals. This included creating physical title cards to be filmed rather than digitally adding lettering. Hawley also wanted to explore alternative representations of the usual elements found in superhero series, such as depicting a fight sequence as a dance battle, explaining, \\"A fight is a very black and white, two-dimensional thing. We're fighting and I'm trying to beat you and you're trying to beat me. But what if the scene is... part of it is peacocking and part of it is a courtship dance and part of it is fighting because 'I hate that I have to work with you' etc. You can't express that in a fight sequence, but in a dance fight you can.\\" Negahban joined the series during production on the eighth episode following the recasting of the Shadow King, and had to reshoot all of the scenes from the first seven episodes featuring the character. Filming for the season took place in a desert. =Music= Composer Jeff Russo stated in April 2017 that he would begin work on the season, including developing new thematic material, in June after he completed work on the third season of Fargo. A soundtrack album for the season featuring Russo's score was released digitally on May 25, 2018. All music by Jeff Russo, except where noted: A second album for the season was released August 17, featuring classics reimagined by Russo. Hawley, who pitched song ideas to Russo, provided lead vocals, with Russo backing on harmony vocals and various instruments including the Moog Synthesizer IIIc. Creating the covers were a \\"unique way to help propel the story,‚Äù Russo stated, ‚ÄúAll of them have lyrical significance and we thought it would be a great idea to do them in the style of the show's music.‚Äù The deluxe edition of the album features a cover of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" as performed in \\"Chapter 19\\" by Dan Stevens and Navid Negahban and a cover of \\"Road to Nowhere\\" by Rachel Keller from \\"Chapter 2\\" in season one. All music performed by Noah Hawley and Jeff Russo, except where noted: =Shared universe connections= For the second season, Hawley wanted to further explore the connections between the series and the wider X-Men universe, particularly in paralleling common elements found throughout the universe such as the \\"gray approach to morality and how characters can cross that line, like Magneto.\\" This was something Hawley felt was unique to this universe, and \\"not the same kinda black and white universe that you get in other comic franchises, and so I really wanted to play with that.\\" The season also continues to explore Haller's father, Charles Xavier, though Hawley was reluctant to confirm an appearance by one of the X-Men film actors (Patrick Stewart or James McAvoy) reprising that role for the show since he felt incorporating elements directly from the films \\"too quickly\\" was \\"cheating on some level\\", rather than telling his own standalone story first. The Shi'ar alien race are mentioned in the season, ahead of their film introduction in the 2019 X-Men film Dark Phoenix. Release =Broadcast= The season began airing on FX on April 3, 2018, and consisted of eleven episodes. Hawley had previously said, in March 2017, that he expected the season to begin airing in February 2018. =Marketing= Footage from the season debuted at the FX Television Critics Association panel in January 2018, introducing Negahban as Farouk in an announcement of his casting. Hawley and several cast members attended the panel. A trailer for the season was released online at the start of March, and multiple commentators noted that it indicated the noteworthy aspects of the first season would be retained for the second‚Äîan unreliable narrative, \\"stunning\\" visuals, and significant cast members including Stevens, Plaza, and Clement. The dancing featured in the trailer and the introductory footage of Negahban were also highlighted. An artistic video installation created by Marco Brambilla Studio was open to the public at Goya Studios in Los Angeles from March 30 to April 1, 2018. It consisted of a chamber that several people could be sealed in, with a \\"moving kaleidoscope of imagery from the series\\" then displayed on screens around the chamber and onto a series of mirrors above to \\"completely envelope you in a very trippy, very Legion manner\\". The images were backed by music, and included teases of the second season. Visitors to the exhibit could also get their photo taken with a series of mirrors that evoked the style of promotional posters released for the season. A \\"blue carpet\\" premiere event was held for the season on April 2, at the Directors Guild of America headquarters in Los Angeles. Reception =Ratings= =Critical response= The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 89% approval rating for the second season, with an average rating of 7.66/10 based on 30 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Legion returns with a smart, strange second season that settles into a straighter narrative without sacrificing its unique sensibilities.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 85 out of 100 based on 10 critics for the season, indicating what the website considers to be \\"universal acclaim\\". =Accolades= For the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, Dana Gonzales received a nomination for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series (One Hour) for the episode \\"Chapter 9\\".

The project is being implemented by the Andhra Pradesh Solar Power Corporation Private Limited (APSPCL), a joint venture of Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation and the New & Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh Ltd. A 1,000 MW solar park at Kadapa was approved by the Union Government in August 2015. NTPC Limited invited bids from solar power developers to develop 250 MW capacity in March 2016, and 650 MW capacity in July 2016. The auction for 250 MW concluded on 11 April 2017. NTPC awarded the contract to French firm Solairedirect for a record-low tariff of INR 3.15 per kWh, beating the previous low of INR 3.29 per kWh awarded in auctions for the Rewa Solar Park on 10 February 2017. The price is the levellized tariff for 25 years. Although the Rewa contract was awarded at a cost of INR 2.97 per kWh, the levellized tariff over the contract's 25 year period amounts to INR 3.30 per kWh. The other bids received for the project (and the quoted prices) were Canadian Solar Energy (Rs 3.39), Greenko Energies (Rs 4.09), Azure Power (Rs 4.38), Mohoba Solar (Rs 4.54) and Mahindra Renewables (Rs 4.68). In January 2017, SECI issued India's first grid-scale solar-plus-storage tender to install 5MW/2.5MWh battery energy storage systems to two separate solar projects of 50 MW each in the park. The project has been delayed due to Andhra Pradesh discoms refusing to purchase the power generated at the solar plant. Discoms argue that solar tariffs have dropped considerably since the auction for the Kadapa park took place and prefer to source power from other sources. In February 2020, 250 MW capacity was commissioned by Solairedirect and the remaining 750 MW is under various stages of construction.

Instead, various documents may be used or required to prove a person's identity, whether for government or commercial purposes such as: * International and domestic travel * Starting a job with a new employer * Obtaining social welfare * Opening bank accounts * Asserting identity with government agencies or companies * General purpose validation of identity when picking up goods etc. * At the request of police or security officers for legally valid purposes. * Asserting that one is a responsible adult (generally 18 years or over in Australia) to: ** Access age restricted venues such as licensed premises, casinos, nightclubs or other gaming venues. ** Purchase of alcohol, tobacco, knives or aerosol based spray paint. Overview Currently, driver licences, issued by the state and territory authorities, are the most widely used personal identification documents. Driver licences list a person's full name, date of birth, current address and contains a photograph. They can commonly be used for personal identification for various purposes such as obtaining various government permits and documentation (for example, passport or tax file number) as well as for opening bank accounts or applying for credit cards. (See also 100 point check.) For people who do not drive, the road authorities of the states and territories will issue a \\"photo card\\", also called \\"proof of age card\\", to people who do not have a driver's licence. Other identity documents sometimes used include a passport, an official birth certificate, an official marriage certificate, cards issued by government agencies (typically Medicare card), some cards issued by commercial organisations (e.g., a debit or credit card), and utility accounts. Often, some combination of identity documents is required, such as an identity document linking a name, photograph and signature (typically photo-ID in the form of a driver licence or passport), evidence of operating in the community, and evidence of a current residential address. Proof of citizenship or right to work status on a visa may be required in some cases, such as when applying for a job. In these cases separate photo identity may also be required.  Main Types  There is no consistent standard for verifying identity. For most purposes, an Australian drivers licence or Australian photo card will suffice; however, for more sophisticated transactions (e.g. applying for a passport or opening a bank account), each institution tends to have its own rules. Some examples of identity documents are: =Primary Identification Documents= The highest category of identity documents that often act as primary validation of identity include: * Australian passport * Australian citizenship certificate * Overseas passport * Australian birth certificate * Australia drivers licence * Overseas drivers licence * Australian Document of Identity * Australian Certificate of Identity * Australian Convention Travel Document * ImmiCard * Australian state and territory issued identity photo cards * Australia Post Keypass identity card (Regional, limited recognition) * Australia Post Digital iD =Secondary Identification Documents= Other documents generally used to enhance an identity check along with primary documents, or used for specific purposes include: * Medicare card * Federal Concession cards * Australian Seniors Card * Australian Marriage Certificate (for change of name) * Australian Change of Name Certificate (for change of name) * Utility bill - a Telephone, Water, Electricity or Gas bill * Travel concession card issued by State transport authorities * Rates notice - a notice of rates issued by an Australian municipal council * An Australian education institution identification card * A letter of enrollment from an Australian school or education institution * An Australian bank issued plastic debit or credit card * An Australian bank statement * Motor vehicle registration papers issued in Australia * Home insurance papers Preference is given to Identity documents showing full name, address and a photo, and documents issued by Australian institutions. For proof of identity purposes, some of the documents are listed as primary and others secondary. Generally at least one primary and one secondary document is required to prove identity at the time of origination of a new facility or product, along with documents that have a photo and address. Requirements vary from institution to institution, and from time to time. The 100 point check, that gives higher points for photo-ID government documents, and lower points for less reliable identity documents, remains a popular system, but is not ubiquitous. Photo identity Primary means of acceptable photo identification includes: * Australian passport or foreign passport * Australian state and territory issued identity photo cards * Australian driving licence * Australia Post Keypass identity card. * Australia Post Digital iD For visitors to Australia: * Foreign driving licence - if a photo is present * Foreign national identity - if a photo is present. Some institutions may accept for general purposes other forms of photo identity, such as student identity cards.  Verification  There are cases where it is against the law to use false or fake identity documents. Documents used for identity have security features - training and experience is necessary to properly identify genuine documents from counterfeits especially as the security features of many documents are not published. Increasingly online facilities are available for document verification services and establishing Digital identity in Australia: * The Australian Government Department of Home Affairs provides a document verification service that allows for validation of some licences and certificates. * The Australian Government Department of Home Affairs also provides a bio-metric face verification service * The Department of Immigration and Border Protection offers a Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) service to confirm work conditions and validity of visas.Identity document * Some States and territories allow for drivers licences, photo cards and certificates to be validated online e.g. NSW and Victoria. * Private companies offer aggregated online identity checking services e.g. Digital iD by Australia Post, VIX Verify and Equifax For organisations choosing to out-source identity verification, over-the-counter services are available from some providers, such as: * Australia Post Verification of Identity (VOI) service. * Equifax ZipID * ID Secure  Issues  While it is rare for people to be stopped on the street and asked for identity documents, it was raised in NSW parliament that there are 47 (possibly more) theoretical instances where identity particulars and/or documents need to be supplied to authorities by state law alone. In some cases head covering may need to be removed. In 2016, proposed laws to force bicycle riders in NSW to carry identity were abandoned after public resistance. Drivers must carry a drivers licence, however for most people, while they can be asked for identity (Name and address etc.), failure not to show should generally not result in any breach of law, however they may be refused entry, refused passage, or arrested if there is an associated suspected breach of law (e.g. supplying false details to Police). There have been two proposals to introduce ID cards for tax and social security access in Australia: The Australia Card in 1985 by the Hawke Labor Government and the Health and Social Services Access Card in 2006 by the Howard Liberal Government. Although neither card would have been an official compulsory ID card, they were both criticised as leading to de facto ID cards. Ultimately, both proposals failed. On 22 October 2017, Pauline Hanson was reported requesting a new identity card to stop Welfare fraud. It has been suggested that the Australia Card has been delivered gradually over time utilising cooperation of various state and federal government agencies and documents. New alcohol laws in 2017 require pubs and bars to scan ID documents against a database of people who should be denied alcohol, for which foreign passports and driver licences are not valid.

Trans-Pacific journey The voyage started in Macau on July 12, 1587 and reached the Californian shore on October 18, at 35.5 degrees North latitude, where they went on shore in a bay with sandy beaches (perhaps Morro Bay) and contacted native people. Then the sailing progressed southwards along the American western coast to Acapulco, reached November 22 same year. The main goals of the journey were to find the purported islands Rica de Oro, Rica de Plata and Armenio (which Unamuno concluded did not exist), and also the very profitable selling of Chinese goods in New Spain in fact breaking, like Gali three years earlier, the monopoly accorded by the Spanish Crown to the Manila galleon. Actually the official trade galleon of 1587 from Manila, the Santa Ana, reached the Californian coast one month later than the Esperanza just to be captured and sacked by the two pirate English ships commanded by Thomas Cavendish.

Adi Brahma Sabha  Consequently, the Adi Brahmos then set up their own faith called Adi Brahma Sabha in 1828/1830 by Trust deed of Brahmo Sabha and codified their religion as Adi Brahma Dharma published from 1848. The founders of this Brahmo religion were foremost reformers for nationalism, equality, secularism and education which now stand enshrined in the Constitution of India as Fundamental Rights. These founding fathers of Adi Dharma believed then that Hinduism was thoroughly corrupted and debased and that strong Law (i.e. Dharma) of first Moslems and then English Rulers could cleanse India from these evils. For their associations with the Rulers of the times, they were ostracised and barred from orthodox Hindu society but were amply compensated by \\"being so weighed down in honours by the British that they forgot all the radicalism of their youth.\\" It was Dwarkanath Tagore alone who could publicly lambast an English Magistrate Abercrombie Dick on the emergence of servile mai-baap (great lord) ruling culture of 19th-century Bengal as follows: > ... If Mr.Dick wishes me to specify what I deem the present characteristic > failings of the natives I answer that they are ‚Äì a want of truth, a want of > integrity, a want of independence. .. arising from being subjected to > misrule of an igorant, intolerant and licentious soldiery .. falling into > abject submission, deceit and fraud.The Englishman ‚Äì 6 December 1838. Previously in 1829 Dwarkanath and Prasanna Coomar had founded the Landholders (Zamindars) Association which in its variants went on to play such role in modern India's development. The first major success of this Zamindari Sabha was arraigning the East India Company forces against Titumir a Muslim extortionist of Zamindar's (landlords who perpetuated a system of feudalism with the support of the British), at Nadia in November 1831.  Trust deed Principles (1830)  By the 1830 Trust deed of Brahmo Sabha principles it was held that all men are equal and without distinction and there is no need for priests or formal places for worship etc.  Adi Dharma doctrine (1848/1850)  By the 1848 Adi Brahma Dharma published doctrine of Debendranath Tagore, it was held that present Hinduism doctrine is corrupted, but that the original Vedas of pre-Aryan times (being relatively pure, though still fallible and not Scripture to be relied on) as reflected by 11 judiciously chosen Upanishads also speak of a single formless God who requires no temple or priest or idol for worship, only a rational and pure conscience of an intelligent mind. That there is no caste ‚Äì high or low ‚Äì all people are equal, in this World and before God. The doctrine of reincarnation is rejected. The doctrine of God being incarnate is also rejected.  Caste Disability Removal Act (1850)  This publication resulted in the famous \\"Removal of Caste Disabilities Act\\" of August 1850, and Brahmos were free to establish their own religion and marry amongst themselves without fear of disinheritance from ancestral property. At the 23 December 1850 annual meeting of Calcutta Brahmo Samaj, Debendranath formally announced the Brahma Dharma as doctrine of the new religion. This announcement resolving certain aspects of Hinduism in Rammohun's doctrine also served to effectively separate Brahmoism from Hinduism.J. N. Farquhar, Modern Indian Religions, 1915.  Lala Hazarilal's Shudra controversy (1851)  Krishnanagar in Nadia district of West Bengal has always had special place in Brahmoism. Many old Brahmo families came from here including that of Ramtanu Lahiri who was the first Adi Dharmi to renounce his Brahmanical caste thread in 1851 (even before Debendra Nath who removed his in 1862). The gesture by Debendranath of sending Lala Hazarilal of Indore (an untouchable from the lowest Shudra caste by birth) as Adi Dharma's first preacher to Krishnagar instead of a Brahmin preacher well versed in Sankskrit literature was, however, not too well appreciated and gave great offence to the Nadia royal family.Sivanath Sastri \\"History of Brahmo Samaj\\" 1911//1912 2nd edn.pg. 377 publ. \\"Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, Calcutta 1993\\"  Christian missionaries banned (1856)  In 1856, Christian preachers attempting to convert Adi Dharma adherents were banned entry into Brahmo premises by Debendranath Tagore.  Adi Dharma mission to Punjab (1861)  In 1861 the famous Adi Brahmo preacher Pundit Navin Chandra Rai (\\"Roy\\") went to Punjab and spread this new faith and opened many Adi Brahmo houses of worship all over Punjab (West and East) at Jullundur, Lyallpur, Lahore, Amritsar etc. People of all faiths and castes without distinction flocked to the new creed, and over 580 Pandit families were enrolled till 1870. Subsequently, the Oriental College was established at Lahore by Pundit N.C. Rai.  Adi Dharma mission to Andhra & Telangana  In 1861 another Adi Brahmo preacher Atmuri Lakshminarasimham returned to Madras Presidency and devoted much time in the Telugu speaking areas. many publications of Adi Samaj in Bengali were translated into Telugu language and published by him from the printing presses of Madras. In 1862, he came in contact with and converted Kandukuri Viresalingam who was to become father of Telugu language and notable Brahmo nationalist of the era. Later the two fell out over religious differences  First schism in Brahmo Samaj (1866)  In 1865/1866 there was a dispute in the Brahmo Samaj over caste distinctions, and many younger members of the Samaj who were influenced by Christian missionaries were expelled from the Adi Samaj by Hemendranath Tagore ‚Äì which religion was henceforth known as the Adi Brahmo Samaj.  Character of Adi Dharma changes (1867‚Äì)  From 1867 after the First Schism, the Adi Dharam movement became stridently nationalistic. A Hindu Mela was regularly organised which became the precursor to the Swadeshi movement and then the Indian National Congress. In the meanwhile the expelled Christian factions from Adi Samaj launched a sustained and bitter campaign to wean away the Adi Dharma missions outside Bengal. A great deal of propaganda was hurled from both sides.  Brahmo marriage (bill) controversy (1871)  In 1871 the expelled group petitioned the Government to recognise them and their inter-faith marriages claiming that Brahmos are not Hindu, not Christian, Moslem, Jew or Parsi etc.. The Adi Brahmo group opposed this stating We are Brahmos first, and Hindus second and finally a compromise Law was passed as Act III of 1872 to enable marriages between Brahmos and thereby recognising the Brahmo religion by State. Adi Dharma's Maharshi and Gurudev visit Punjab (1872) In 1872/1873 Debendranath Tagore (the Maharshi) and his son Rabindranath Tagore (Gurudev) visited Punjab and spent much time in worship at the Golden Temple at Amritsar. A famous Sikh gentleman Sirdar Dayal Singh Majithia from the priestly family of this temple joined the Adi Dharma and subsequently contributed much money to the faith and also became a founder Trustee of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in 1880.  Emergence of Arya Samaj in Punjab (1875)  In the meantime (1872‚Äì1875) in Punjab due to Schisms in Adi Brahmo Samaj at Calcutta, a new variant of Adi Brahmoism called Arya Samaj began to take root. While travelling its founder Swami Dayanand came into close and extended contact with Raj Narayan Bose, Debendranath Tagore etc. Swami Dayanand closely studied Tagore's book Brahmo Dharma, a comprehensive manual of religion and ethics for Adi Dharma, while in Calcutta. The bone of contention between these two Samaj's was over the authority of the Vedas ‚Äì whose authority the Adi Dharma reject and hold to be inferior works, whereas Arya Samaj hold Vedas to be divine revelation. Despite this difference of opinion, however, it seems that the members of the Brahmo Samaj and Swami Dayanand parted on good terms, the former having publicly praised the latter's visit to Calcutta in several journals and the latter having taken inspiration from the former's activity in the social sphere.  Lala Hardayal pracharok in Northern India (1876)  Another close associate of Debendranath Tagore, Lala Hardayal volunteered to promote the Adi Dharma cause in the Central Provinces and Punjab. he linked up with Sirdar Dayal Singh Majithia and the pure Adi Dharma message of One God without Caste or Priests took great root in this Province. Many low caste Sikhs, low caste Hindu converts to Christianity etc. joined the Adi Brahma Dharma to be eventually absorbed back after education into their respective faiths. It is pertinent that Debendranath was greatly influenced by works of Kabir and Baba Guru Nanak and always kept their books at his side.  Developments of Adi Dharma in Telangana (1870‚Äì1880)  By 1871 Kandukuri Veeresalingam (father of Telugu nation) was heavily influenced by Brahmoism. A movement was covertly established by him to seek independence of the Telugu speaking provinces of Madras Presidency and the Nizamate of Hyderabad. A secret society for this was organised in 1878 in Rajahmundry under the cover of Prarthana Samaj of Andhra Pradesh. He bitterly opposed immoral (i.e. polygamy and child marriage) practices of the upper classes of Telangana starting a new phase of reform for Adi Dharma in Telugu speaking regions. :\\"He contributed to the political sphere by his activist journalism of writing about issues such as corruption in the local administration. The presidency government kept a close tab on the Indian language press and sometimes responded to investigate such allegations. Viresalingam also intervened more directly by conducting widow remarriages and popularising new forms of voluntary association.\\"\\"Fashioning Modernity in Telugu: Viresalingam and His Interventionist Strategy\\" Vakulabharanam Rajagopal University of Hyderabad, Sage Publications (2005) page 66 Kandukuri vacillated between Adi Dharm nationalism and Keshab Sen's dictum of \\"Loyalty to Sovereign\\" being rewarded with Rao Bahadur title in 1893 by British. But by clinging to Keshab Sen philosophy of \\"Loyalty to Sovereign\\" till 1907, Viresalingam found himself increasingly isolated from the militant ideology of Adi Dharma's new stridently nationalistic adherents in the region.Rajagopal (2005) page 69  2nd phase of formation of Provincial Samajes (1878‚Äì)  In 1862 and again in 1864 the Adi Dharma stalwarts from Calcutta visited Bombay, Madras Presidencies. They also visited Hyderabad (Deccan). As a result, many anti- caste, One Formless God Adi-Dharma affiliates were started including the Prarthana Samaj in Mumbai. The Veda Samaj in Madras, and the Brahma Samajam in what is now Andhra Pradesh.  Many Christian members reabsorbed in Adi Dharma (1878‚Äì1880)  In 1878 these expelled neo-Christian members split again, but almost all of them recanted (by getting executed a Trust deed of Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in 1880 virtually identical in Principles to the 1830 Adi Trust deed) and were reabsorbed into Brahmoism by Maharshi Debendranath and Raj Narayan Bose the founders of Hindutva (i.e. Brahmoism's nationalistic religion of Adi Dharma of pre-Aryan uncorrupt times means All Indians are One without distinction, regionalism and caste) as Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. The small remainder of Adi heretics formed a Christian / Baha'i new world religion called Navabidhan or New Dispensation and are not considered part of Adi Dharma and in 1891 formed another Samaj in Bangladesh and are called Sammilani's (or Universal Brahmo Religionists) organising annual Conference of Theists.  Tragedies in Tagore family of 1884  In 1884 there were two demises in Debendranath's family. The deaths of his third son Hemendranath at the young age of 40 and the unexplained suicide of his daughter-in-law Kadambari Devi (wife of his fifth son Jyotirindranath the then secretary of the Adi Brahmo Samaj) in April were to have significant implications for Adi Dharm.  Legal victories for Adi Dharma (1897‚Äì1903)  In 1897 a landmark decision of the High Court of the Punjab in Sirdar Dayal Singh's case after his demise, upholds that Brahmoism is a separate religion from Hinduism (except for the Adi Brahmos ‚Äì Adi Dharma'ites who remain within Hinduism), whereas simultaneously affirming such gems as \\" .. Sikhs are Hindoos and nothing but Hindoos ..\\" and \\" A Sikh (Sardar Dyal Singh) who follows Brahmoism without actually converting to it continues to remain a Hindoo\\". This decision is confirmed by the Privy Council in 1903 (Rani Bhagwan Koer & Anr. vs. Acharya J.C.Bose and Ors) and is the leading Judgement even today on the vexed question of \\"who is a Hindu?\\".  Adi Dharma in N.India, Pandit Nabin Chandra Ray  The heart of Adi Dharma in Punjab Province was Bengal's Adi Brahmo Samaj legend Pundit Nabin Chandra Ray. The Punjab Brahmo Samaj under his influence favoured Hindi language as against Punjabi actuated by nationalistic considerations. He looked upon Hindi as the national language of India and wanted it to be the foundation for the edifice of Indian nationality. He was the founder of Oriental College Lahore and also its principal. He was the first Asst. Registrar of Punjab University, and one of its Fellows. He was Secretary of the Stri Siksha Sabha fighting against heavy odds to establish girls schools. He was one of the most active members of the Anjumani Punjab, afterwards becoming its Secretary and renamed it as Jnan Vistarini Sabha engaging 8 Pundits to translate various works. To spread reform among the backward people of Punjab he published various newspapers in Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi and the highly controversial \\"Widow Remarriage Advertiser\\" in English. For the depressed classes he started a night school and the Chamar Sabha. His doors were open to all helpless and the poor.The Bombay Chronicle of Sunday 13 May 1929 After N.C.Rai left the Punjab in course of his service, initiation into Adi Dharm was given to castes other than Brahmin or Pandit by his successors ‚Äì a few of whom were Sikh. As a result, many Sikhs also joined Adi Dharm in large numbers relying on the Mulmantra of Sikhism i.e. Japuji Sahib which begins as Ik Onkar Sat Naam Karta Purakh .. translated as \\"There is only one God His name is Truth He is the creator..\\" =Provocation in the Punjab (1900 -)= In 1900 the Government passed the Land Alienation Act. In 1907 other taxing laws were promulgated and finally in 1919 the Government of India Act was amended. As a result, the lower castes of North India were effectively deprived from land ownership. At the same time the Government divided the electorate on communal lines, resulting in sharp polarisation between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. To counter this the leadership of Adi Dharma (at its 1916 conference at Kanpur) resolved to propagate Adi Brahmoism as a distinct religion for the Punjab. In 1917 this resolution was also seconded by the Indian National Congress which was then closely associated with Adi Dharm.  Adi Dharma expands to Bodo people (1906)  In 1906 another preacher from Assam by name Kalicharan Brahma was initiated into Brahmoism. His reform work among the Bodo people established the Bodo Brahma Dharma among the Bathow religionists of Assam and reformed that religion of the marginalised indigenous Assamese communities considerably. The followers of Adi Dharam in that region are known as Brahmas.  Schisms in Punjab branches (1922‚Äì)  From 1922 onwards, dissension in Arya Samaj factions of Punjab between the Vasant Rai and Mangoo Ram groups again split the regional Adi Dharma movement. Both groups approached the Lahore Headquarters of Adi Brahmo Samaj for recognition which was denied to both. This led to rivalry and inducements from all sides including Arya Samaj, Christian missionaries, Sikhism etc. causing considerable confusion in the Northern Provinces as to who represents Adi Dharma here. The major controversy at this time concerned many depressed caste Sikhs of Chamar grade in a supposedly casteless Sikhism rediscovered Ravidass's teachings of the 14th century (claimed by them to be incorporated in Guru Granth Sahib) and got themselves registered as Adi -Dharmi's in the 1921 and 1931 Census of Punjab after the legal decision in Bhagwan Koer's case and the Pirali precedent. This action by a section in the Punjab once again revived the Pirali controversy which echoed in Calcutta. Concerted action and representation by Adi Dharma and all sections of Brahmo Samaj ensured that after 1931 no further caste based Census took place in India. Thereafter the Congress Party revived casteism again with M.K. Gandhi asserting on 7 September 1936 \\".. Sikhism is part of Hinduism and if becoming a Sikh is conversion then this kind of conversion on the part of Harijans is dangerous\\"  Adi Dharma leaders from the Punjab  * Lala Kashi Ramji ‚Äì a widely respected person who travelled all over Northern India spreading message of the Samaj. * Prof. Ruchi Ram Sahni ‚Äì Secretary of Lahore Samaj and Secretary of Dayal Singh Educational Trust. * Baboo Abinash Chandra Mazommdar ‚Äì Set up many T.B. Sanitoria in Punjab and Simla. * Bhai Prakash Devji ‚Äì joined Adi Dharma after leaving Dev Samaj. Instrumental in drawing many adherents to Adi Dharm. Also Editor of Brahma Pracharak from 1903 till 1908. * Bhai Sitaramji ‚Äì Pillar of Punjab Samajes from Sialkot. After Partition settled in Delhi at Delhi Brahmo Samaj. * Lala Basant Lalji ‚Äì From orthodox Punjabi Kayastha family converted to Adi Dharm (Brahmo Samaj) on returning from England. Become Commissioner of Income Tax Delhi and pillar of Delhi Brahmo Samaj. His elder son was Air Chief Marshal Pratap Chandra Lal (Chief of Air Staff ‚Äì India).  Marriage Validity Controversies (1938‚Äì)  Indira Gandhi's controversial \\".. neither conventional nor legal.. \\" Vedic wedding image. Guardian.co.uk A considerable controversy also erupted at this time over validity of Arya Samaj marriages. With low caste converts to Christianity being reinducted into Hindu ranks after shuddhikaran or purification, orthodox Hindu society was not prepared to accept these reconverts or marry with them. With a few deaths of such converts often from very rich families or landed gentry, property disputes began reaching the Courts and the existing laws proved inadequate. With neither side willing to budge, a Marriage Law for Arya Samajis was deferred for almost 25 years. Luckily a fortituous occurrence took place. Krishna Hutheesing (a sister of Jawaharlal Nehru) wanted to marry a Prince ‚Äì a Jain by religion. Such a marriage between parties of different castes although then allowed in law (by further amendment in the Brahmo law in 1923) was frowned upon and meant separation from the family and community. They arranged to be married under the Adi Brahmo Law of 1872 and gave false declarations (as was done in B.K.Nehru's case also). When these facts came out, the Adi Brahmo's fiercely objected to misuse of their Act and began to watch the banns. In 1938 Jawaharal Nehru's daughter Indira insisted on marrying her sweetheart Feroze. Once again being of different faiths they could not be legally married under any law of the time except the Adi Dharma Law. The elders (incl. Rabindranath Tagore) of Brahmo Samaj at Shantiniketan, Delhi and Allahabad were consulted (incl. by M.K.Gandhi) and who after considerable disagreement advised instead that the long pending Marriage Validity law for converted low caste Arya Samajis be enacted, which was speedily done in 1939 by an obliging British Government, enabling the loving couple to be wed in early 1942 by secret pre-Vedic Adi Dharm reformed Brahmic rites taught to Nehru's priest by Adi Dharma elders at Allahabad in the presence of Brahmos like Sarojini Naidu with the groom wearing a sacred Brahmic thread in secret.\\"The pheras took place at night. The marriage ceremony was performed according to the Vedic tradition.\\" pg.31 \\"Indira Gandhi ‚Äì \\"\\"The ceremony uniting Indira and Feroze was neither conventional nor legal ... They were both reluctant to sign a declaration that they did not belong to any religion. .. Hence the illegality of Indira's marriage.\\" pg.177‚Äì181 \\"Indira ‚Äì The life of Indira Nehru Gandhi ‚Äì \\" Katherine Frank, 2002. Ever since, these Adi Dharma rites have been used by the Gandhi-Nehru family for their marriages ‚Äì such as for Rajiv Gandhi to Sonia Gandhi, Sanjay Gandhi to Maneka Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi to Robert Vadra etc. and the Vedic law of Adi Dharma has never been repealed despite passage of the Hindu Code in 1955 which repealed all such similar marriage validity laws for other faiths.  Post Independence developments (1947‚Äì)  After Partition of India in 1947, the Adi Brahmo Dharma Headquarters for the region shifted from Lahore to New Delhi to Adi Brahmo Brahmin descendants of Babu Raj Chandra Chaudhuri's (who married daughter of Babu N.C. Rai) family settled here.  Ambedkar and Adi Dharma (1949‚Äì)  In 1949‚Äì1950 B.R.Ambedkar approached the Adi Dharm leaders at Delhi to get absorbed his followers into Adi Dharma. Due to bitter debates in the Constituent Assembly with Brahmo members and over the Hindu Validity Marriages Validity Act 1949, he could not be accommodated within the Adi Dharma principles. This was chiefly due to his insistence on denouncing Manu ‚Äì paradoxically respected by Adi Dharma's founding father's as a great Law Giver. Thereafter in about 1955 Ambedkar and his followers instead chose to join Buddhism. Legal Status of the Brahmo (Adi Dharma) Religion In 1901 (Bhagwan Koer & Ors v J.C.Bose & Ors, 31 Cal 11, 30 ELR IA 249) the Privy Council (Britain's highest judicial authority) upholds the finding of the High Court of the Punjab that the vast majority of Brahmo religionists are not Hindus and have their own religion unlike Sikhs (\\"who are Hindu and nothing but Hindus\\"). Debendranath Tagore was held to be the founder of the Brahmo religion. The Court distinguished Brahmo \\"religionists\\" from \\"followers\\" of the Brahmo Samaj who continue to retain their Hinduism. In 1916 the Indian Civil Services Ethnography Administration Surveyor R.V. Russell examines in detail and publishes that Brahmo Samaj is indeed a Religion (and differentiates it from \\"sects\\").\\"Tribes and Castes of C.Provinces of India, R.V.Russel and Rai Bahadur Hira Lal, Vol 1 of 4 Volumes, Macmillan, London, 1916 \\" In 1949 the Government of India passes the \\"Hindu Marriages Validity Act\\". Despite discussion in Parliament Brahmos are not brought within the scope of this Law. In 1955 the Government of India passes the \\"Hindu Code\\" (a comprehensive set of laws for Hindus). Again despite discussion in Parliament, Brahmo religionists are not brought within the scope of these laws which, however, now become applicable to Hindus who are also followers of the Brahmo Samaj . In 2002, Bangladesh enacted a law recognising Brahmo religionists and Brahmo marriages to Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists. On 05.May.2004 the Supreme Court of India by order of the Chief Justice dismissed the Government of West Bengal's 30-year litigation to get Brahmos classified as Hindus. The matter had previously been heard by an 11 Judge Constitution Bench of the Court (the second largest bench in the Court's history).Official Brahmo Samaj website http://www.brahmosamaj.org/  Future of Adi Dharma  The Adi Dharma movement of the Brahmo religion is today the largest of the Brahmo developments with over 8 million adherents. Adi Dharma has spawned not only the Indian National Congress party but also the Hindutva agenda of their opposition. Its radical contribution to India's polity was summed up by a President of India, :\\"It is ironic that a small dedicated group of outcaste twice born Brahmins of the highest caste of Bengal setting out to rid India of caste and prejudice have instead engendered a national Constitution which perpetuates a divisively violent Casteism in Hindu religion which tears the social fabric of India apart especially in the field of education.\\"From the commemorative speech by N Sanjeeva Reddy, 27 Jan. 1981 at Kanpur for centenary celebrations of the Brahmo Conference Organisation.

On the front from left: Hanna R√∂nnberg, Hilma Westerholm, Elin Danielson and Nina Ahlstedt. Behind them sitting in the chair Fredrik Ahlstedt and standing by him Victor Westerholm. Sitting on the ground in the back Alex Federley and standing behind him J. A. G. Acke. The √ñnningeby artists' colony () was founded in 1886 by Victor Westerholm, a Finnish landscape painter, who had a summer house in the village of √ñnningeby on the √Öland Islands in the Baltic Sea. It attracted Finnish and Swedish artists who gathered in the summer to paint landscapes en plein air rather than in their studios. Many of the participating artists were women. Background In the 1870s, European artists began to develop an interest in painting outdoors rather than in their studios. Formal approaches to landscape painting gave way to more realistic or naturalistic depictions, often reflecting the effects of changing light. Throughout Europe, artists began to gather each summer in villages where they could work together in pleasant surroundings. Artists from across Scandinavia met above all in Skagen in the north of Denmark from the early 1880s, forming a group which became known as the Skagen Painters. In the mid-1880s, the Finnish Impressionist painter Victor Westerholm from Turku bought Tomtebo, a little summer house beside the Lemstr√∂m Canal in the village of √ñnningeby to the northeast of Mariehamn. While studying in D√ºsseldorf, he had met Anders August Jansson (1859‚Äì1882) from √Öland who encouraged him to visit the islands in 1880. In 1885, he exhibited paintings at the Helsinki salon including October day on √Öland. From 1886, he invited his artist friends to join him there each summer to paint in the open air. Their works included marine landscapes and village scenes as well as portraits of the local inhabitants. They also painted each other. Participants Many of the artists who painted in √ñnningeby were women. The first group of artists to join Westerholm included Fredrik Ahlstedt and his wife Nina, Aleksander Federley, Hanna R√∂nnberg and Elin Danielson, all of whom were Finns. The Swedish painter J.A.G. Acke also participated the first year, becoming one of the group's most important figures returning each year until 1892 when interest began to fade. Other painters who joined the group in subsequent years include the Finns Elias Muukka, Elin Alfhild Nordlund, Helmi Sj√∂strand and Dora Wahlroos, and the Swedes Ida Gisiko, Anna Wengberg, Eva Topelius, and Edvard Westman. Ellen Favorin and Am√©lie Lundahl visited in 1889. One of the most important members of the group was Hanna R√∂nnberg. She first visited in 1886 and returned year after year. Both a writer and a painter, she contributed to the colony's success by including it in her fictional and non- fictional writings. Her paintings often included people, her best works appearing around 1890, some achieving success at exhibitions. Thereafter she concentrated increasingly on her short story collections including Fr√•n √Ölands sk√§r and Brovaktens historier. In 1888, Edvard Westman invited her to join him in Denmark. They met in Copenhagen and together visited the artists colony in Skagen. For a time they planned to marry but never did. Axel Andersson, better known as J.A.G. Acke, was the first Swede to visit the √ñnningeby where he painted some of his best works during the three summers he was there. He stayed at the √ñvre Knapans farn where the large dining hall became his studio. He painted portraits of the farm's hostess \\"Knapans farmor\\" (Knapan's grandmother) and of Victor Westerholm. He also painted landscapes, inspired by French impressionistic works playing with the effects of sunlight. It was in √ñnningeby that he met his wife to be, Eva Topelius, daughter of the writer Zacharias Topelius. After their marriage in 1891, they returned to √ñnningeby in the winter in February 1892. It was there he completed his enormous Sn√∂ljus (Snow Light) measuring 4.6 by 1.6 metres which he had hoped to exhibit in Paris, but it was refused. Museum √ñnningeby-museet. Over the years, the artists were accommodated in √ñnningeby's spacious farmsteads. One of these, the Jonesas farm, was converted into a museum which was opened in 1992 and expanded in 1999. It exhibits paintings by a number of those who gathered in the artists colony. Gallery of paintings The gallery presents a selection of paintings by the √ñnningeby artists.

He also became known during the 1920s as a stage actor and theater director. He acquired additional notability with a lifestyle that some found eccentric.Georg Zivier: Romanisches Caf√©, Berlin 1965, pp. 78ff  Biography  = Family provenance and early years = He was born in Berlin. His great x 3 grandfather, the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn (1729‚Äì1786), had become the ancestor of a prominent dynasty of bankers and musicians, notably Felix Mendelssohn and his sister Fanny Mendelssohn, who were thereby Franz's first cousins three times removed (generationally). Franz von Mendelssohn, who later Italianised his first name, was the son of the banker and his young wife Giulietta. She was a daughter of the fashionable Florentine portraitist Michele Gordigiani. After her husband died in 1917 she moved in with the cellist Gaspar Cassad√≥, who was 26 years younger than she was, and moved back to Italy, leaving her teenage children, and Francesco to look after the large family home at K√∂nigsallee 16 in Berlin's Grunewald quarter. They evidently had little reason to feel abandoned, there being a very large number of Mendelssohn cousins in Berlin. The house contained numerous antiquities and, most notably, the large art collection that Robert von Mendelssohn had built up. This included works by Guardi, Goya and Rubens. There were also two paintings attributed at that time to Rembrandt: a self-portrait and a portrait of Hendrickje Stoffels (after Mendelssohn's death re-attributed to the \\"school of Rembrandt\\"). From 1910 Robert von Mendelssohn had aggressively and presciently expanded the collection, selecting works by Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, Max Slevogt, √âdouard Manet and Claude Monet. Francesco showed a similarly sure touch in his selection, buying works by Toulouse-Lautrec, Segantini and Camille Corot. His greater love was for music and the theatre, however. As a pupil of Pablo Casals and Arthur Williams he became a professional cellist. He became a solo performer, and was also, at different rimes, a member of the Busch quartet and of the Klingler quartet. Reflecting the large social network of which the Mendelssohns were at the heart, members of Berlin's intellectual elite with whom he played chamber music in private included Albert Einstein. He also wrote a book about Eleonora Duse, who was a friend of his mother's and his sister's God mother. He translated the plays of Luigi Pirandello from Italian, at the same time working as a movie actor and as a theatre director. Co-stars included Lotte Lenya, Peter Lorre, Fritz Kortner, Theo Lingen, Heinz R√ºhmann and Paul H√∂rbiger. Among social commentators Francesco von Mendelssohn became known as an eccentric. He drove a white Lancia cabriolet in which the seat covers were made of ermine, and often appeared in public wearing a red leather suit or a yellow silk dressing gown. With his friend Ruth Landshoff he like to turn up wearing an evening dress, while she, as his partner, wore his suit. In his parents' house in Grunewald he held high-profile social events at which leading figures from the arts and politics mingled with men from the gay community. His close friends included Harald Kreutzberg, Vladimir Horowitz und Gustaf Gr√ºndgens. His various lovers are believed to have included Ruth Landshoff. = Emigration = The Mendelssohns were baptised as Christians but, as racist awareness increased, widely perceived as Jewish. After the change of government in January 1933 it became apparent that the antisemitism which had underpinned the populist rhetoric of the Nazis in opposition was no mere empty threat, even though a Christian baptism might be regarded by some as sufficient protection against the rising threat of state persecution. The von Mendelssohn siblings emigrated. While Eleonora, who at this point was married to an Austrian, moved back to , in Upper Austria, and not far from Salzburg. Francesco von Mendelssohn stayed away from German speaking central Europe, spending most of the time between 1933 and 1935 in Paris. He also took the opportunity to extend and deepen his contacts in the United States. As early as April 1933 he staged Brecht's Threepenny Opera at the Empire Theater on Broadway. It was the work's US premier, but the production was not a success, closing after twelve nights. Francesco von Mendelssohn spent the summer of 1935 in Venice and then, travelling with Eleonora, Lotte Lenya, Kurt Weill and the impresario Meyer Weisgal, set sail in September from Cherbourg aboard the Majestic, in order to start a new life in New York City. Here he worked as a production assistant with Max Reinhardt. Initially he lived in hotels in New York. Later he acquired a house in 83rd Street where he resumed his habit of throwing lavish parties for members of the artistic elite. He moved briefly to Hollywood, but by 1937 was back in New York. His work on a production of The Eternal Road by Franz Werfel and Kurt Weill led to a falling out with Reinhardt in 1937. The massive fortune that the von Mendelssohn siblings had inherited from their banker father was greatly diminished by the costs and government restrictions that accompanied in their emigration, but they remained wealthy by most standards and were able to provide financial support to other refugees. Eleanora had been able to take part of the art collection to Austria when she moved there, and they had also managed to convey the two supposed Rembrandt paintings to , the Basel art dealer, leaving at the Mendelssohn Bank in Berlin some copies that their grandfather had had made. However, fearing government reprisals if the switch was noticed, a cousin persuaded them to have the real pictures returned to Germany where arranged for them to be lodged with the central bank in order to prevent their sale abroad. Ownership of the works, at this point, rested with Francesco's mother, Giulietta von Mendelssohn. In the end she decided to have them sold, entrusting the transaction to the family's agent, Aldo Cima. He arranged for the sale of most of the Mendelssohn art collection through the Austrian dealer, . Francesco von Mendelssohn had a history of melancholy that predated his emigration, and in his American exile he became a high level depressive, also suffering badly from alcoholism after 1937. Bernoulli portrayed him at this time as childish, probably afflicted with syphilis alongside his other ailments, and badly in need of serious therapy if he were to pull through. During the next few years he was a patient in a series of clinics, and also frequently found himself detained in various prison cells after becoming involved in \\"incidents\\" and fights. = Seeking restitution = The end of the war and of Nazi Germany raised the possibility of restitution following the loss of the von Mendelssohn art collection. Francesco was no longer in any state to attend to the matter, and it was left to his sister Eleonora to travel to Europe to try and recover the lost art works. After Aldo Cima's suggestion that she should bribe the museum directors had been rejected, she sought to achieve restitution through a combination of appeals for reimbursement and attempts to buy some of the paintings back. One problem that she faced was that the paintings had been the property of her mother, Giulietta von Mendelssohn, who had been classified as an Aryan. It was therefore not possible to demonstrate that she had been forced to give up the collection as a result of race-based persecution. In the end her application for restitution was rejected by the German authorities in 1953, but by this time Eleonora von Mendelssohn was no longer in a position to know of it. In January 1951 her (fourth) husband, Martin Kosleck fell out of an apartment window and was badly injured. At about the same time, her brother Francesco suffered a stroke following a fight and arrest. Eleonora von Mendelssohn was found dead on 24 January 1951. The evidence suggested suicide. Eleonora von Mendelssohn left substantial debts. Francesco von Mendelssohn, with help from his sister's executrix, Lillian D. Rock, made another attempt to recover the pictures from he Mendelssohn collection. He now asserted that their mother had gifted the pictures to Eleonora and himself on New Year's Eve in 1932. Albert Einstein, by now an international celebrity, spoke out in support of Mendelssohn's claim. But the authorities were unmoved. The portrait of Hendrickje Stoffels attributed to Rembrandt, which had been purchased for the \\"Fuhrer Museum\\" in Linz, was handed over by the US occupying forces to the Munich-based Treuhandverwaltung (public trusteeship administration). After Mendelssohn's claim for restitution had been rejected it was loaned by the West German government to the Alte Pinakothek art gallery in Munich and then, in 1967, transferred to the St√§del institute in Frankfurt. The 1652 Rembrandt self-portrait \\"in fur, with chain and ermine\\" (\\"im Pelz, mit Kette und Ohrring\\"), had been sold through Schatzker to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna: it is still there. After the first rejection of the case based on Francesco von Mendelssohn's belated recollection concerning the alleged transfer of ownership from their mother to her children back in 1932, Lillian Rock, his sister's executrix withdrew from the case. Later, at a public hearing on the matter held before the district court in Vienna, no one turned up to represent the Mendelssohn family's position, and their application was again rejected. = Final years = Francesco von Mendelssohn had been in no position to appear at that hearing on his own behalf. He spent a period as an inmate at a psychiatric clinic in White Plains,. There are contemporary reports that he may have undergone a lobotomy, possibly in order to protect him from the further clutches of the justice system. His central nervous system and intellectual faculties had apparently been damaged by his chronic alcoholism. In 1957 he came under the care of Lilly Wittels, widow of the psychiatrist Fritz Wittels. He visited Vienna in 1960: friends from former times found him utterly transformed and uninterested. In his final years he broke of contact with former friends. In 1972 he was found to be suffering from an advanced case of cancer, and he died on 22 September 1972. Only a few people attended his burial. As Alice Bernoulli wrote in a letter to her friend Salka Viertel on 10 October 1972, \\"No wonder, that ... most of his old friends found him too dull after his total character change, and left him alone.

It has weeping branches, smooth bark, pale green linear leaves, small white flowers and thin-walled fruit. Description Leptospermum madidum is a shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of and has weeping branches and smooth white, cream-coloured or pink bark. The leaves are arranged alternately, sessile, linear, the same shade of pale green on both sides, long and long. The flower buds are arranged singly in leaf axils surrounded by bracts that are shed before the flower opens. The flowers are wide on a pedicel about long. The floral cup is long, and the sepals have hairy margins. Flowering occurs from July to October and the fruit is a glabrous capsule long and wide. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1920 by Cyril Tenison White and William D. Francis who gave it the name Agonis longifolia and published the description in the Botany Bulletin, Department of Agriculture, Queensland. In 1958 Stanley Thatcher Blake changed the name to Leptospermum longifolium but the name was an illegitimate name because it had already been used for a different species. 1992 by Anthony Bean changed the name to Leptospermum madidum, publishing the change in the journal Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (madidum) is from a Latin word meaning \\"moist\\" or \\"wet\\", referring to the species' growing on the banks of freshwater creeks and rivers. In the same journal, Bean described two subspecies and their names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Leptospermum madidum A.R.Bean subsp. madidum has leaves wide and fruits wide; * Leptospermum madidum subsp. sativum A.R.Bean has leaves wide and fruits wide. Distribution and habitat Subspecies madidum is confined to the Cape York Peninsula where it grows on the banks of creeks and rivers. Subspecies sativum is found along watercourses and in sandstone gullies in the Kimberley region of Western Australia and the northernmost parts of the Northern Territory. Conservation status Subspecies sativum is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" in Western Australia, by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

He was appointed chief of staff of the 25th Tank Brigade, forming at Novoye Sormovo, on 29 September, which was sent to the Western Front as part of the 5th Army in the second half of October. The brigade was subsequently relocated to Istra, and Dubovoy took command of it on 31 October, during the Battle of Moscow, in which the 25th fought in the Solnechnogorsk area.

The idea for the album came when Wall of Sound's founder, Mark Jones, wanted to release a compilation of hard-to-find music by unsigned artists, with whom he had worked with via his distribution and pressing deals, so that the music could be heard by a wider audience. He picked his favourite such tracks which there was already an audience for and this became the compilation. The album has been described as trip hop and acid jazz and contains music that straddles different genres such as jazz, funk and soul, serving as a document of several electronic genres emerging at the time which incorporated sampling and live instrumentation. Upon release, the album was one of only several \\"alternative\\" electronic compilations and became a critical success, with critics finding its disparate styles to flow well together. Two successful sequels were released in the ensuing years and the album has been credited as an influential predecessor to big beat music. Background During the early-to-mid 1990s, while Mark Jones was working for Soul Trader, a London-based record distributor owned by his friend Marc Lessner, he and Lessner started the Wall of Sound record label by arranging \\"pressing and distribution\\" (P&D;) deals for unsigned electronic musicians that Jones and Lessner enjoyed the work of. \\"This is how we found Kruder & Dorfmeister, Howie B, Pussy Foot and Basement Jaxx,\\" noted Jones, \\"artists that have went on to have quite a bit of success.\\" The idea for Give 'Em Enough Dope Volume One came when Jones suggested to Lessner that they compile a compilation album of \\"all the music that we work with and material that we know people want and can't get.\\" As the label had yet to release any music yet, Give 'Em Enough Dope Volume One became Wall of Sound‚Äôs first release. Jones recalled of the album‚Äôs conception, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a big masterplan; it was just a natural progression of the work I was doing and where I was working. Writer Si√¢n Pattenden later reflected on the scenario: \\"[Jones] would hear tracks by trendy artists working in bedroom studios, which were released by Soul Trader. Jones thought the tunes needed to be heard by a wider audience, so he got his favourite tracks and released them as a compilation album.\\" The album was inspired by Headz (1994), a compilation album released by trip hop label Mo' Wax that features abstract hip hop music. Music Howie B in 2007. Give 'Em Enough Dope Volume One coincided with the development of numerous new electronic genres incorporating sampling and live instrumentation that are represented on the album. According to John Bush of AllMusic, Give 'Em Enough Dope Volume One is an acid jazz and trip hop compilation of music by European artists that incorporates elements from other genres such as funk, soul, jazz and rap. The album's liner notes describe the music: \\"'Jazz not jazz', 'soul not soul', 'hip not hop', call it what you won't, the atoms keep splitting and new genres are created almost every year. The combination of live playing and sampling has opened up another preverbial can of worms.\\" In his book Drum 'n' Bass: The Rough Guide, writer Peter Shapiro also felt that the album incorporates downtempo music. Jones compiled and co-ordinated the album alone, and in an interview with M Magazine, he described Give 'Em Enough Dope Volume One as \\"a reaction against the diluted dance music that had started happening. You weren‚Äôt allowed to say you loved Kraftwerk, hip hop or Steely Dan. Everything was kept separate.\\" Fittingly, despite being categorised as a trip-hop and acid jazz compilation, the album is eclectic; Jones described the music as combining \\"the deep dub superfreaked sound of Howie B,\\" \\"the mystical D.O.P.E. of Austria's Kruder and Dorfmeister,\\" \\"the smokin' jazz jam of the Ballistic Brothers\\" and \\"the boomin' bass, breaks and beats of Mekon.\\" Release and reception Give 'Em Enough Dope Volume One was released on 30 June 1994 in the United Kingdom by Wall of Sound, and was the label's first release. In the United States, C & S Records released the album in 1995 as a spin-off to their compilation series Street Jazz, which had begun the previous year. The compilation was mastered by \\"Paul at Porky's\\" and its sleeve was designed by Dave Grimshaw and Jeff Logan. The album was released to critical acclaim. John Bush of AllMusic rated the album four stars out of five and said that, despite containing a variety of styles, \\"the disparate genres flow well and the sounds are very fresh, making this a great compilation of '90s fusion.\\" Jones felt the album was critically acclaimed \\"because they're weren't really that many alternative compilations out back then.\\" The success of the album brought Wall of Sound into \\"that alternative scene,\\" although Jones later recalled that, while other electronic labels on the scene like Mo' Wax, Warp and Ninja Tune \\"were all doing their thing,\\" Jones \\"wanted to bring melody\\" and achieve commercial success. In the Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture, Peter Childs noted that the roots of big beat music, which became popular in the late 1990s, could be traced back to Give 'Em Enough Dope Volume One, as well as to the Beastie Boys' album Paul's Boutique (1989). Jones later spoke with Richard Dorfmeister regarding the song \\"High Noon\\" on the former's radio show. Two sequels to the album were released, Give 'Em Enough Dope Volume Two (1995) and Give 'Em Enough Dope Volume Three (1996), both of which were even more popular and successful than the original album, with Robert Christgau naming the second edition the sixth best compilation of 1995.

It was released in Japan for the Xbox One on February 25, 2016, with a director's cut version being released worldwide for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows in 2017. A Nintendo Switch version was released on July 25, 2019, making it the first Raiden game to be made available on a Nintendo console since Raiden Trad.  Gameplay  Gameplay in Raiden V is a mixture combination of the prior installments including Raiden Fighters sub- series/spinoffs, but the plot incorporates real-life locations, with the player craft fighting enemies in New York, the Middle East, France, England, Belgium, and Sweden. Like the Raiden Fighters series and Raiden IV: Overkill, players have a choice of three aircraft: The Azuma from Japan (the aircraft from the early games), Spirit of Dragon from United States and Moulin Rouge from France. They all have different grades of power, defense, mobility and a sub-weapon of fixed power. Unlike Raiden IV and Raiden Fighters Jet, all aircraft have the same pre-installed bombs. Another change with Raiden V is the introduction of a shield/energy bar, allowing the player to take a number of hits before being destroyed. However, only one ship is provided, thus on destruction, the player will lose their score and be asked to continue. 'Flash Point' returns since its introduction in Raiden III. There are five levels of Flash Point gauge, with the chain score challenging players to make it to the online leaderboard. Killing enemies rapidly will fill the gauge more efficiently thus improving the score multiplier. Raiden V also introduces the Cheer System where online players can cheer each other to unlock the skill Cheer Call. In tight situations, using Cheer Call will cancel all enemy bullets at once and allow players to greatly boost sub-weapons for a short time until the Cheer Call gauge is depleted. Boosted sub-weapons cause heavy damage and instant attack speed. The Cheer Call gauge can increase slowly by progressive play and rapidly every time the player presses \\"Cheer\\" to other players who get any achievement, such as destroying a certain number of enemies or defeating a boss without taking damage. Players that receive many cheer counts will increase the cheer call gauge faster.  Plot  The story of Raiden V follows the previous games. Raiden V is the first game in the series to have a detailed story. Named characters engage in fully voiced dialogue, along with narration during the story screens. The story fleshes out several narrative elements that had gone unexplained in previous games, such as the origin of the Fighting Thunder project and the Crystals' motives. Depending on the stage route taken by the player, the story changes slightly while not affecting gameplay, as the characters become more aware of each other's true motives the higher the rank of a given stage is. The game's story takes place 17 years after humanity's war with the Crystals began. The Vanquish Crystal Defense, or VCD, awaits an attack order to launch Fighting Thunder to assist the North American army, who have been decimated by attacks by the Crystals. Aboard the VCD flagship, the Bellwether, commanding officer Richard \\"Max\\" Maxwell (voiced by Xander Mobus in English) and communications officer Eshiria Portman (Rina Hoshino) lament that the VCD and the Fighting Thunders are being held back during what they consider a Crystal contamination far bigger than in the past. After receiving the long-awaited attack order, Fighting Thunder assists the North American army, defeating a battleship that was taken over by the Crystals. Max and Eshiria receive word from VCD's Middle East branch that there is major Crystal activity in the region. Eshiria notes that the energy signatures are the same as what they detected in North America. They then discover a cave full of Crystals. Max has a shipment of the Crystals from the cave sent to a French shipping port en route to the Large Hadron Collider, under the suspicion that the Crystals may have signs of intelligence. With this suspicion, Max orders an SOS call to the French shipping port, even under the doubts of his superior, international peace councilor Helga Lindenbaum (Laura Post). Max's suspicions were proven right, with the Crystals attacking the port. After fending off the port attack, Max realized that the Crystals can upgrade any machinery they contaminate. Max orders a mission to the Large Hadron Collider facility, expecting a massive Crystal presence there. His suspicions are again proven right, as the Crystals have laid siege to the facility in an orderly military fashion. Max hypothesized that the Crystals have a command structure. After clearing out the Crystal contamination at the Large Hadron Collider facility, a surveillance drone detected on the Bellwether's deck steals the Crystals and delivers them to a pirate mercenary, Valbarossa Hawkeye (Sarah Anne Williams), who plans to transport them to an unknown facility. Max orders Fighting Thunder to pursue Valbarossa Hawkeye and retake the Crystals. Valbarossa Hawkeye detects Fighting Thunder and orders their flagship to attack. As the Valbarossa's ship is being disabled by Fighting Thunder, the stolen Crystals suddenly started to contaminate the ship's command bridge, upgrading it with an energy beam cannon to use against Fighting Thunder. After defeating the contaminated ship, Valbarossa Hawkeye, who reveals herself to be a woman, joins Max and Eshiria and boards the Bellwether. Valbarossa Hawkeye reveals her client to be Lieutenant Walter Erick Campbell (Erik Scott Kimerer), head of VCD's weapons development division and a researcher for the SHIFT organization. With the Valbarossa's help, VCD locates the SHIFT facility and orders Fighting Thunder to raid the facility. Earlier, Campbell reminded to Max that it was the efforts of SHIFT researching and utilizing Crystal technology that the Fighting Thunder project and the Bellwether exist, and that the entire war effort is dependent on him. During the SHIFT raid, Campbell reiterated his stance on SHIFT's continued research, denouncing the Montevideo Agreement that bans research on Crystal technology. However, Max says in response that he, being on the front lines, and the rest of the world know how dangerous the Crystals are, since they contaminated Valbarossa Hawkeye's flagship. Max and Campbell eventually fall out, and Fighting Thunder is ordered to destroy the SHIFT facility. After destroying the facility, Fighting Thunder attempts to escape, but Campbell spites Max and Fighting Thunder, sending out mobile weapons to attack them. Following the attack on the SHIFT facility, Campbell was placed under custody of the VCD. Helga Lindenbaum confirmed all of Max and Eshiria's hypotheses of the Crystals, culminating with the conclusion that one of them is able to relay information to all other Crystals and the machines they contaminated, comparing it to Carl Jung's concept of the collective unconscious. Helga then orders Max and Eshiria to leave Earth's atmosphere and launch a counteroffensive against the Crystals on their homeworld. Upon arriving to the Crystals' home planet, Max and Eshiria notice that there are no signs of life and is completely overrun with Crystals. Detecting large energy signatures underground, they order Fighting Thunder to penetrate the interior of the planet. Eshiria discovers that the atmospheric composition of the planet is exactly like Mars. The data that Fighting Thunder relayed to the Bellwether reveals that the large Crystals detected within the planet are made up of the same composition as water. Max, Eshiria, and Valbarossa Hawkeye realized that the Crystals' attacks over the past 17 years were not a normal alien invasion. Their true motives were to reset the planet Earth by annihilating all life on the planet through pollution and contaminating their weapons and machinery before cleaning up the pollution and making the planet habitable again. The game features multiple endings depending on how the player performed during gameplay. One ending has VCD return to the Solar System after the offensive against the Crystal homeworld to see what looks to be Mars, only to find out it was the Earth reduced to a lifeless red rock by the Crystals. Another ending has the Bellwether unable to return to Earth due to damage sustained during the final battle, but with the Earth celebrating the Fighting Thunder victory over the Crystals in their homeworld, Helga sends a rescue ship that will come for them in a month, and Max cautions everyone to stay vigilant in case of another attack in the future. Reception Raiden V was released to generally favorable reviews, according to Metacritic, which provided aggregated scores of 75 and 73 for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions, respectively.

History The Titken House in the late 19th century The site was acquired by the wealthy grocer Niels Titken in 1754. The building was constructed in 1754-1756. It has been suggested that the architect was Lauritz de Thurah since he has signed an estimate of needed materials but this has been questioned (see below). Titken's grocery store was originally located in the cellar with entrance from Fredericiagade. The building was expanded with the construction of Fredericiagade 18 in 1935. The navel officer and shipbuilder Henrik Gerner (1741-1787) had lived the last years of his life at the site (Fredericiagade 18) from 1784 to 1787. Nearby Gernersgade is named after him. Another navel officer, Jost van Dockum (1753-1834), had lived at the same address in 1784-1797. He would later be in charge of the Or√¶vestenen Battery during the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807. Fredericiagade 18 was rebuilt in 1835. The officer and politician Peter Frederik Steinmann (1812-1894 lived at Fredericiagade 18 in 1853-54\\\\. He would later serve as Minister of Defence in 1874-75. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency in 1918. Architecture The building seen from Fredericiagade The Titken House is built to a simple Baroqu style design and consists of three storeys over a high cellar. The 11 bay long facade on Bredgade is only broken up by a three-bay median risalit tipped by a low triangular pediment. The facade on Fredericiagade is six bays long and features a two-bay triangular pediment. In their book Danmarks Arkitektur, Byens huse - byens plan, Sys Hartmann and Villads Villadsen questions the assumption that the building was designed by Lauritz de Thurah. They find it unlikely that he would have followed Eigtved's guidelines for buildings in Frederiksstaden to the extent that is the case and with such a meeager result. They describe the 11-bay facade on Bredgade as monotonous and the median risalit with its triangular pediment as \\" crabbed\\". The two-bay triangular pediment on Fredericiagade is described as notoriously disharmonic and the roof that continues all the way down to the too tall windows is compared to \\"a hat pulled all the way down to the eye brows\\". The main entrance was originally located uin the median risalit. It was accessed by was of a sandstone staircase and opened to a vestibule. This is also different from most of De Thurah's buildings where the main entrance is usuaklly placed in a gateway in one of the sides. Hartmann and Villadsen concludes that the facade amy have been designed by some of Eigtved's associates after his death in 1754 and that Lauritz de Thurah may just have approved them. Fredericiagade 18 is six bays wide and has a central gateway which opens to the courtyard.

The conservation area spans three municipalities which include Liberty Borough, Lincoln Borough, and Elizabeth Township. The property is owned and managed by Allegheny Land Trust and is open year round to the public for educational and recreational purposes.  The Conservation Area  Dead Man's Hollow was established as a conservation area in 1996 and is considered to be the largest privately protected area in Allegheny County. Since the mid 1990s, volunteers from Allegheny Land Trust and other non-profit conservation groups based in the PIttsburgh region have made significant progress in removing trash and debris as well as invasive plant species from the property. This continued effort has allowed the area to return to a lush green wonderland beneath a canopy of native hardwoods. The Dead Man's Hollow conservation area is also the home to a variety of Pennsylvania wildlife including twenty-four different species of birds. In January 2017, the Pennsylvania's Department of Conservation and Natural Resources designated the area as a Wild Plant Sanctuary.  Industrial History  The Boiler House \\"ruins\\" of the Union Sewer Pipe Company in Dead Man's Hollow. The remnants of two industrial businesses that once thrived in the McKeesport area, the Bowman Brickyard and the Union Sewer Pipe Company, can also be found throughout the Dead Man's Hollow conservation area. Operations for both companies began in the late 1880s and lasted until a devastating fire brought it to an end in 1920. A number of the established hiking trails give visitors the unique opportunity to ~~\\"~~ step back in time ~~\\"~~ while exploring the \\"factory ruins\\". Among the most visited locations at the former industrial site are the large circular foundations of kiln ovens that were used in the pipe making process as well as the decaying graffiti covered walls of the company's boiler house. Other notable locations are the slightly curved wall of a former P&LE; Railroad siding and an oversized drainage tunnel leading to the Youghiogheny River.  Haunted History  As the story goes, Dead Man's Hollow earned its dismal name in 1874 when a group of adolescent boys were roaming through the hollow and came upon a decomposed body that was hanging by a nose. The victim was never identified and no one was ever charged for the murder. Soon the natural isolation of the hollow became the setting for other dark tales of criminal acts and untimely deaths. From suspicious drownings and violent gunfights to tragic explosions and lightning strikes, Dead Man's Hollow has been the scene of many grisly incidents and accidents. Supposedly one or more of these bizarre tales have prompted quite a few encounters with the unknown in the secluded hollow. Visitors to the site often return with unexplainable stories involving a shadowy presence, strange odors, and even the sound of voices when no one else was near.  Recreation  With over eight miles of hiking trails throughout Dead Man's Hollow, visitors can easily spend an entire day (or night) exploring the conservation area. And with its close proximity to the Great Allegheny Passage recreational trail, Dead Man's Hollow has become a welcome place for cyclists to stop and relax for a few minutes. According to the Allegheny Land trust website, Open Hunting is permitted on this property as long as individuals apply for a free permit before hunting on any conservation area. It has also been suggested that anyone wishing to use the property for hunting purposes be familiar with the established trail system and avoid the areas where human interaction is likely.  Media History  Over the years, the stories of Dead Man's Hollow have been featured in numerous articles printed in the McKeesport Daily News and the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. In 2000, many of Dead Man's Hollow's tales made their debut in book format thanks to a former resident of Lincoln Borough named Karen Frank. With the help of the community, Frank compiled a number of old photographs and historical stories about the history of Dead Man's Hollow. No long after the book _Dead Man's Hollow : An Oral History and More_ was released in limited quantity and quickly sold out. Today, history enthusiasts have made this out- of-print publication is one of the most sought-after books in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Dead Man's Hollow returned to the pages of another book in 2009 when History Press released _Legends & Lore of Western Pennsylvania_. Written by folklore historian Thomas White, this particular book has been hailed by many as the best source of information on every ghostly legend that calls Dead Man's Hollow home. In 2010, Dead Man's Hollow was launched into the 21st Century when it received its very own official website. With an extensive timeline that chronicled the hollow's dark history, detailed trail maps, and plenty of photographs, www.dead-mans-hollow.com provided visitors with everything needed to explore Dead Man's Hollow in person or from an armchair.

It works in the country promoting a wider knowledge of the UK and the English language; encouraging cultural, scientific, technological and educational co-operation between the two countries and promoting the British culture, education and society.  History  In 1934, the British Foreign Office officials created the British Committee for Relations with Other Countries to \\"support English education abroad, promote British culture and fight the rise of fascism\\". The name quickly became British Council for Relations with Other Countries and was then, in 1936, officially shortened to British Council. With Algeria's independence in 1962, the British Council opened its first office in Algiers, but closed in 1994 due to the security situation in the country. In 2006, the British Council reopened in Algiers with operations commencing in 2007. In July 2015, the British Council in Algeria partnered with Echorouk El Yawmi to launch a competition to learn English. The newspaper used to publish a series of weekly articles in English from July 24 to August 20, 2015. Participants had to read the articles then answer the two asked questions on the British Council's website, the newspaper's website or the Facebook page. The prizes were granted to five winners and were awarded in September in a ceremony held at the UK Ambassador's Residence in Algiers in presence of prominent personalities.  Organization  British Council building in London The British Council in Algeria is a charity registered in England and Wales and Scotland and is governed by Royal Charter. It is also a public corporation and an executive nondepartmental public body (NDPB), sponsored by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Its headquarters are located in Hydra, Algiers.  Activity  Much of what the British Council does in Algeria has an international dimension involving countries in North Africa and the Middle East such as Connecting Classrooms, Skills for Employability and Active Citizens. It works with Algerian organisations, be they governmental or non- governmental, to develop various programs, especially in the area of English and education. It also organises arts and cultural activities with local partners.

Model There are several variants of SKF discussed in. =Special case= In the simpler case, switching state-space models are defined based on a switching variable which evolves independent of the hidden variable. The probabilistic model of such variant of SKF is as the following: [This section is badly written: It does not explain the notation used below.] : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\Pr(\\\\\\\\{S_t, X_t^{(1)}, \\\\ldots, X_t^{(M)}, Y_t\\\\\\\\}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & \\\\Pr(S_1)\\\\prod_{t=2}^T \\\\Pr(S_t \\\\mid S_{t-1}) \\\\times \\\\prod_{m=1}^M \\\\Pr(X_1^{(m)}) \\\\prod_{t=2}^T \\\\Pr(X_t^{(m)}\\\\mid X_{t-1}^{(m)}) \\\\times \\\\prod_{t=1}^T \\\\Pr(Y_t\\\\mid X_t^{(1)},\\\\ldots,X_t^{(M)},S_t). \\\\end{align} The hidden variables include not only the continuous X, but also a discrete *switch* (or switching) variable S_t. The dynamics of the switch variable are defined by the term \\\\Pr(S_t \\\\mid S_{t-1}). The probability model of X and Y can depend on S_t. The switch variable can take its values from a set S_t\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,M\\\\\\\\}. This changes the joint distribution (X_t,Y_t) which is a separate multivariate Gaussian distribution in case of each value of S_t. =General case= In more generalised variants, the switch variable affects the dynamics of X_t, e.g. through \\\\Pr(X_t\\\\mid X_{t-1}, S_t).Bar-Shalom, Y. and Li, X.-R.

The name Shtandart was also given to the royal yachts of the tsars until the Russian Revolution in 1917. Tsar Nicholas II's royal yacht was last of this series.  Design  In 1994 a small group of sailing enthusiasts led by Vladimir Martus started construction of a replica of the historical ship. Martus developed a new layout of the Shtandart wherein she was built with four bulkheads, dividing her into five compartments. The replica frigate has three masts and her displacement is 220 tons. She is 25.88 metres (82.0 ft) registered length, 27.5 metres (90 ft) long on deck and 34.5 metres (113 ft) long overall. The Shtandart is 7.0 metres (23 ft) wide with a draft of 3.0 to 3.3 metres (11 ft). The ship is designed for speeds between 8-9 knots under sail, and under auxiliary engines she can make up to 13 knots (25 km/h). The original crew complement in 1703 was between 120 and 150, and the modern crew consists of 30 trainees and 10 officers. The \\"Shtandart Project\\" (a non- commercial organisation dedicated to youth development) launched a replica of the frigate on September 4, 1999. The modern Shtandart has two zones: * The historically accurate area above the gun deck: the steering wheel and helm, all decorative carvings, the furniture, and all of the masts, spikes, guns, gangways and hatches are carefully reconstructed. * The \\"modern\\" area built to modern standards and in compliance with safety regulations: This includes two Volvo Penta TAMD 122P engines and a generator. holiday of alumnus, 2007 Gorch Fock in front of the Naval Academy M√ºrwik (2010) During the large maritime gathering in Dunkirk (2013). Bow of the Shtandart.  Milestones of the Shtandart  * On September 4, 1999 the Shtandart was launched at the Petrovsky Shipyard in St Petersburg. * On 25th June 2000 the Shtandart set sail on her maiden voyage. The frigate retraced the route taken by Peter I, during his Grand Embassy. * In 2005-2009, the Shtandart has played the part of the \\"dream ship\\" at the Scarlet Sails festival, an annual celebration of the end of the school year in St. Petersburg from a novel by Alexander GrinBrief description of \\"Scarlet Sails\\" celebration and other holidays.another \\"Scarlet Sails\\" link (Russian). * Over the last twenty years (till 2020) the Shtandart has sailed approximately in the Baltic, North, Norwegian Barents and Mediterranean Seas, as well as sailing to Canary islands. She has visited one hundred and seventy five ports in nineteen countries. Around 9000 trainees has been on board Shtandart for sailing adventure and training.  Classification of the ship  From 2007, sailing vessels in Russia faced challenges with a classification. The new National Sea and River Authority (then –†–æ—Å–º–æ—Ä—Ä–µ—á–Ω–∞–¥–∑–æ—Ä/Rosmorrechnadzor, now –ì–æ—Å–º–æ—Ä—Ä–µ—á–Ω–∞–¥–∑–æ—Ä/Gosmorrechnadzor) refused to issue classification certificates for sailing ships. The Shtandart was one of the most prominent of these vessels, so her dispute with this government agency was widely publicized. The ship has been sailing in European waters non-stop as sail-training-ship under classification of Russian Yachting Federation. In March 2020 Shtandart received classification from Russian Register of Shipping as sport and Sail Training vessel, and appropriate registration of Russian Maritime administration .

Exhibition organizers can now look forward to book additional space for their exhibitions and conferences.  History  The history of the association is the history of the machine tool industry in India. The concept of binding machine tool manufacturers into an association was first mooted at an informal gathering of ‚Äòlike-minded‚Äô manufacturers. The manufacturers met at a formal gathering in New Delhi on 20 September 1946 to concretise the thoughts of bringing together all machine tool manufacturers under one umbrella body. The meeting chaired by Sir Dhunjishaw B. Cooper came up with the name of ‚ÄúIndian Machine Tool Manufacturers‚Äô Association\\" or IMTMA in short for this umbrella body representing the interest of the machine tool industry. The association was granted instant recognition by the government as a body representing machine tool manufacturers in the country. IMTMA was constituted with 19 members. = Executive committee = The seal of recognition of IMTMA was affirmed at the first meeting of the association's executive committee on 28 August 1947 at Indian Merchant's Chamber in Bombay. The chairman of the first executive committee was Sir Dhunjishaw B. Cooper. = Annual meeting = The first annual general meeting of IMTMA was held on 29 January 1948 at Indian Merchant's Chamber at Lalji Naranji Memorial Building in Bombay. A meeting of the first-elected members of IMTMA executive committee followed the first annual general meeting. The meeting unanimously elected M.B. Jambhekar as president of IMTMA and D.S. Mulla as the first vice president of the association. Subsequent annual general meetings of the association were held every year. = Registration = IMTMA was reconstituted as an association registered under the Indian Companies Act in Bombay on 26 March 1973. = Secretariat = In its early days the association operated from Bombay. In 1965 IMTMA moved into its own premises in Rampart Row. In 1991 the association shifted from Bombay to Delhi. IMTMA office in Bangalore came into existence two years later in 1993. With nearly 50% of the machine tool companies being based in Bangalore besides a large concentration of manufacturers in prominent industry sectors such as aerospace, defence, etc. also in the city, IMTMA felt the need of setting up a Centre of Excellence to cater requirements of the industries based in the region and also the need to have a world class exhibition infrastructure. With those thoughts BIEC was constituted. This eventually became the head office of IMTMA and the Gurgaon office becoming the regional office in north. = IMTEX = Enamoured by the success of the International Machine Tool Exhibition in Hannover, members of IMTMA felt the need to hold similar fairs in India. The wheel was thereafter set in motion with the first machine tool exhibition in Bombay. The first ‚ÄúAll India Machine Tool Exhibition‚Äù was held in 1969 in the premises Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Company Private Limited in Vikhroli, Mumbai, over 7,000 square metres. Initially christened as the ‚ÄúAll India Machine Tool Exhibition‚Äù, this later became ‚ÄúIMTEX‚Äù. Bombay continued to host IMTEX for the next two decades until 1989. In 1992, IMTEX moved from Bombay to New Delhi and was held in Pragati Maidan with participation from over 600 companies. IMTEX and concurrent Tooltech exhibition was held in Bangalore for the first time in 2007, when IMTMA constructed a new venue called the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC). IMTMA continues to host the IMTEX (metal cutting) every odd year and IMTEX FORMING (metal forming) every even year at BIEC.

History of Arab League Summit  In 1946, at the invitation of King Farouk of Egypt, leaders of the League of Arab States held their first summit at Inshas Palace in Egypt. The League's seven founding members participated: Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria. During the summit, which focused on the Palestinian cause, participating countries declared their intention to ‚Äòconsult, cooperate and work together in unity‚Äô for the good of the Arab World. They also stressed the importance of utilising all means possible to assist Arab peoples who were still under foreign rule to gain their independence and attain their nationalist aspirations to become active members of the League and United Nations. Since the League's establishment in 1945 and up until 2016, Arab leaders have held a total of 39 summits, of which 27 were ordinary, nine were emergency (or extraordinary) and three were economic. Three of these summits were held in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan: The 11th Ordinary Summit in 1980, the 4th Extraordinary Summit in 1987 and the 13th Ordinary Summit in 2001. In 2000, participants at the Extraordinary Arab Summit, which was hosted by Egypt, agreed to hold the Arab League Council at the Summit Level in an ordinary session in March of every year. This decision was first implemented at the Amman Summit in 2001, which took place on the 26th anniversary of the League's establishment. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is, once again, hosting Arab leaders at the 28th Ordinary Session and its preparatory meetings, embodying the Kingdom's constructive role in promoting joint Arab action.  The Summit Venue  = The Dead Sea Area = To the west of the Jordanian capital of Amman lies the Dead Sea: A rare, natural phenomenon famed for its high salinity and known as the lowest point on earth. A few minutes‚Äô drive from the Dead Sea to the east of the Jordan River lies the baptism site of Jesus Christ, which the Vatican has named an international destination for Christian pilgrimage. Moreover, to the east of the Dead Sea stands Mount Nebo, overlooking Israel, the occupied Palestinian territories, Southern Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt's Sinai. = King Hussein bin Talal Convention Centre at the Dead Sea = The Dead Sea area is home to a number of international hotels, resorts, tourist stops, therapeutic facilities, and conferences. At the heart of the area, among numerous five- star hotels, lies the King Hussein Bin Talal Convention Centre, which has become a destination for conference tourism and has been selected to host the Arab League Council at the Summit Level (the 28th Ordinary Session). Established in 2004, the Centre's architectural style combines Islamic and modern architecture, with its stones and walls reflecting Jordan's environment in colour and design. The three-storey centre includes 27 halls of varying designs and sizes, equipped with the facilities and utilities required to hold conferences, making it an ideal location to host major events and conferences for the World Economic Forum, International Monetary Fund, United Nations and Arab League Summit.  Amman Summit Social Media Platforms  The Media Committee of the Arab Summit 2017 launched its official social media platforms on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube under the handle @ArabSummit2017. Launched for the first time as an interactive tool for Arab summits, these platforms aim to expand outreach to journalists and followers of the news and preparatory meetings of the Amman Summit, scheduled to take place between 23 and 29 March 2017. These platforms seek to engage Arab youth ‚Äì who comprise the largest segment in Arab societies ‚Äì and allow them to weigh in on current Arab issues. __FORCETOC__ __INDEX__ References External links * 2017 Category:2017 in Jordan Category:21st-century diplomatic conferences Category:2017 in international relations Category:2017 conferences Category:March 2017 events in Asia ","title":"2017 Arab League summit"},{"id":"53544016","title":"2017‚Äì18 George Mason Patriots men's basketball team"},{"id":"53544024","text":"The Blue Geranium may refer to: *A short story in the book The Thirteen Problems, by Agatha Christie. *An episode in the 5th series of ITV's Agatha Christie's Marple, see List of Agatha Christie's Marple episodes.

Designed by Wilson Potter and built 1902‚Äì04, it is a prominent local example of Classical Revival architecture, built to house two banks whose previous buildings had been destroyed in a devastating fire. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and is a contributing element of the New Milford Center Historic District. Description and history The United Bank Building occupies a prominent location in downtown New Milford, at the top end of Bank Street, one of its main commercial streets, where it meets the town common. It is a two-story masonry structure, built out of buff-colored brick with brownstone trim. Its main facade, facing main street and the common, is three bays wide, articulated by broad piers which rise to a multilevel cornice and parapeted roof. The main entrance is in the central bay, recessed in a tall round-arch opening. Above the arch is a recessed panel incised with the building name, with a decorative cartouche above that, flanked by sash windows. The flanking bays each have three-part window groups in both the first and second levels. The interior has a central vestibule and hall, which separate the spaces historically allotted to the two banks that were its initial occupants. On May 5, 1902, a fire struck the New England House, a locally well known tavern and inn located at the corner of Bank and Main Streets. The conflagration also consumed the adjacent buildings of the New Milford Savings Bank and the New Milford First National Bank, located down Bank Street. The two banks immediately organized to rebuild, quickly agreeing in principle to build a joint facility on the site of the tavern. Their committee accepted a design from Wilson Potter, an architect then based in New York City. The large-scale features of the building and its prominent setting on the town common make it an imposing feature of the town's commercial district.

It shares the gothic fiction setting with NeocoreGames' The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing and features a lone protagonist who is sent to a border world in an alternate dimension (\\"Ink\\") to defend a series of ancient strongholds against a horde of monsters invading from the depths of that dimension and trying to break through to the physical world. The Xbox One version was released on 3 January 2017 under the title The World of Van Helsing: Deathtrap. NeocoreGames released a PlayStation 4 port, on 28 September 2020.  Gameplay  The player chooses a character out of three possible classes (warrior, sorceress, or marksman) which determine the action aspect of the game, and progresses through levels fighting off hordes of enemies. Each map features a number of pre-set routes for enemies that come in waves, and slots for building various trap types. Those are built and upgraded using the mystical currency \\"essence\\" with predetermined amount at the start of each level. Essence can be gained during the level by killing enemies and completing waves, and spent to build new traps or upgrade existing ones. The player wins if they kill all the enemies in a level and loses if a certain number of enemies manage to reach the base portal. Trap actions that damage and kill enemies are augmented by the player's attacks where the character can move across the map freely, whereas traps are stationary and have a limited range. Role-playing elements come into play between levels where the player can upgrade their character on the basis of experience points received, and buy or craft equipment to provide a boost in abilities (either action- or trap-building related). Some trap types and trap upgrades must also be unlocked separately. The basic story mode features 13 levels, but after the player's character has gained enough experience, two additional modes are unlocked: scenario and endless. The scenario mode allows the player to increase map difficulty by selecting various restrictions, while \\"endless\\" is a non-stop survival mode with limited resources and increasingly tough enemies. Deathtrap also features a multiplayer mode (cooperative and versus for up to 4 players) and a map editor.  Reception  Some reviewers have noted close similarity of the action aspect to Diablo series of games, and that the tower defense aspect likewise doesn't introduce anything significant compared to existing such games, but the genre mix was considered innovative and refreshing. The game has received generally favourable reviews and has a metascore of 77 on Metacritic (PC version).

It was once an important junction station, but it has lost this importance as a result of line closures and now only serves as a stop on the line between Cologne and Gerolstein.  History For topographical, socio-economic and political reasons, the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) decided at a relatively late date to build a railway line through the Eifel. In the meantime the cities of Trier and Cologne had been connected to the rail network. Thus the construction of the line began in November 1867, and almost exactly three years later, Gerolstein station was built. The following rapid construction of the line to Trier was due to the Franco-Prussian War, as the railway company expected possible military traffic. The connection to Trier was already usable on 15 June 1871. At this time, the Eifel Railway demonstrated its strategic-military importance for the first time. The station was built on the territory of the municipality of Glaadt, which had also been the location of the J√ºnkerather Gewerkschaft (J√ºnkerath iron works) since 1687. The present municipality of J√ºnkerath was established around 60 years after the opening of the station. Its importance increased in the early 20th century with the construction of the D√ºmpelfeld‚ÄìLissendorf railway (Mittellere Ahrtalbahn‚Äî\\"Central Ahr Valley Railway\\") and the Cross-Venn Railway (Vennquerbahn), which branched off at the station. J√ºnkerath developed along with the nearby Gerolstein station into an important junction station in the Eifel. Both the freight and passenger traffic grew rapidly, which meant that J√ºnkerath station was constantly expanded. There were four signal boxes and a Bahnbetriebswerk (locomotive depot) on the site. It was also particularly important for its connection to Belgium. As a result, it now served as an important marshalling yard for train formation. In particular, in the First World War, J√ºnkerath played an important role, since the station was at a strategic important position for trains to the Western Front. It is estimated that up to 50,000 soldiers, 3000 horses and 1000 tonnes of supplies were transported over the Ahr Valley Railway (Ahrtalbahn) alone. It was important to keep stays in the station as short as possible, so the station had to be efficient. By 1918, up to 1000 soldiers a day were sent to Belgium along with rations. In 1923, J√ºnkerath station was also affected by the French occupation of the Rhineland. The railway officials abandoned their offices and took part in the resistance in the Ruhr. The French withdrew from Jungkerath only in 1925. In the Second World War, the station was once again of great importance due to its strategic location for the building of the Siegfried Line (Westwall). There was a boom in traffic at the station as a result of the many freight and passenger trains to Belgium. Thus in 1939, over 850 railway workers were involved in operations at the station. When the station was bombed in air raids in 1944, the bombs also hit a train with Soviet prisoners of war. The station was not only affected by enemy attacks: on 12 September 1944, a damaged and out of control V1 crashed at the station. But even then the station was not spared from air raids. In February 1945, the Wehrmacht finally took over the station and used it as a base for guarding the bridges and tunnels in the region. After the war, the station was like a battlefield. In July 1945, workers were asked to report to their workplaces to be able to participate in the reconstruction of the station. The debris was sufficient for the reconstruction of three signal boxes, because as much debris as possible was reused. Since there were no locomotives in the station, the ballast waggons had to be pushed by hand. The points, tracks and signals were also recovered and repaired. In 1948, the station was reopened as a marshalling yard and junction station. From 1950 onwards the station regained its former importance in freight and passenger traffic. However, from the middle of the 1950s onwards, it declined again. In 1959, the railway reorganised its operations and the Gerolstein locomotive depot was redesignated as an outpost of the J√ºnkerath locomotive depot. As a result of the structural change in the region, passenger transport on the Cross-Venn Railway ended on 26 May 1963; almost exactly ten years later, on 3 June 1973, passenger traffic ended on the D√ºmpelfeld‚ÄìLissendorf railway to D√ºmpelfeld. On 1 February 1979, the J√ºnkerath station office was dissolved. From this point onwards, the tracks were reconstructed in the station and on the branch lines. The line to Hillesheim was closed in 1982. However, Jungkerath retained its importance as a marshalling yard for train formation up to the 1990s. In 2003, the line to Losheimergraben was closed, which had been maintained for strategic reasons to link the military training camp in Elsenborn. The marshalling yard was closed in 2004. Since then the railway systems have been considerably reduced and the station building has been neglected. In 2011 to 2016, complex modernisation measures were carried out at the station, which were carried out within the framework of a program funded by Deutsche Bahn, the state of Rhineland-Palatinate and the regional transport association; ‚Ç¨100 million was made available to renovate the whole station.  Railway station buildings and railway lands The station building has been a protected monument since 1978. The main building consists mainly of red crushed stone and has a separate auxiliary building.Heritage list of the General Directorate for Cultural Heritage Rhineland-Palatinate; 2011. The building demonstrates the former importance of J√ºnkerath as a railway junction and an important location for the iron industry in the Eifel region.Administration of the Vulkaneifel, Department 1‚Äîmunicipal and law; 2008. It also conforms to the uniform style of the station buildings built along the Eifel railway. These splendid \\"palaces\\" (Schl√∂sser) were financed from the money that France had to pay as reparations to Germany after the Franco-Prussian War. Since J√ºnkerath station was originally built as a station for the J√ºnkerath Iron Works, the track layout and the locomotive shed were oversized for the station's secluded location, particularly when it was first built. As early as 1871, the Iron Works had its own connecting track to the station. Because of its steadily increasing traffic, the station was extended several times in the following years. At the beginning of the 20th century, the station had four signal boxes. During the modernisation carried out from 2011 to 2016, a new underpass, new seating, new clocks and new information displays were built. In addition, the platforms were raised to 76 centimetres to give full accessibility. In addition, the entire station was signed as a non-smoking station. A passenger survey was carried out as part of these measures. The survey revealed that 95 percent of passengers use the trains only from Monday to Friday. Around half of the workforce commutes to the workplace. 54 people walked, 94 people travelled by car and 32 people travelled by bus. 260 people supported the expansion of the Park&Ride; facilities in the station. Therefore, new parking lots were built during the upgrade on the railway station. This cost about ‚Ç¨569,000, of which the municipality of J√ºnkerath itself provided about ‚Ç¨149.000. The rebuilding measures have always been managed to ensure that train traffic is not hindered. The timetable was changed. Overall, the rebuilding cost ‚Ç¨6 million, of which Deutsche Bahn provided ‚Ç¨3.2 million, the state ‚Ç¨1.3 million and the municipality of J√ºnkerath ‚Ç¨514,000.  J√ºnkerath Railway Museum Near the station is the J√ºnkerath Railway Museum (Eisenbahnmuseum J√ºnkerath). The museum was built in 1991 in a building that was no longer used. The railway museum mainly displays exhibits such as tickets and railway paraphernalia and the trains themselves.

The galaxy lies 75 million light years away from Earth, which means, given its apparent dimensions, that NGC 2782 is approximately 100,000 light years across. NGC 2782 has an active galactic nucleus and it is a starburst and a type 1 Seyfert galaxy. NGC 2782 is mentioned in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies in the category galaxies with adjacent loops.  Structure  NGC 2782 by GALEX = Active galactic nucleus = The nucleus and circumnuclear region of NGC 2782 display starburst activity, with bar of the galaxy providing gas to the nucleus. The active galactic nucleus is hidden by a compact high-column-density absorber and a H2O maser is associated with it. The vigorous star formation creates an unusual \\"superwind\\" of out-flowing gas, which has been detected in X-rays as a bubble like structure, approximately 7 arcsec south of the central region of the galaxy. A similar bubble can be seen in radiowaves at the north side. There is also diffuce X-rays emission. The nucleus of NGC 2782 is a low luminosity active galactic nucleus. = Tidal tails = NGC 2782 shows two tidal tails, directing to opposing directions. As depicted in HI imaging, a plume extends about 5 arcmin toward the northwest, with estimated mass of atomic hydrogen, accounting for about 40 percent of the total HI mass of the system. A shorter HI plume extending toward the east has been associated with the stellar tail which extends 2.7 arcmin toward the east in the optical images. The northwest tail is fainter in the optical spectrum. CO was detected in the eastern tail, underlying the presence of molecular gas and HII regions in the region, with total mass or even more. There is starformation activity in the eastern tail. In the western tail have been detected 7 UV sources. These stellar populations are 1 to 11 million years old. Three of them have high metallicity, similar to that of the nucleus of the galaxy. = Ultraluminous X-ray sources = Via observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, 27 X-ray point sources, of which 13 are ultraluminous X-ray sources (without counting the central one), were observed near the nucleus and are likely associated with the galaxy. This number is unusually high for a galaxy, although ultraluminous X-ray sources are common in starburst galaxies. Sixteen of these sources have a visual counterpart.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 2782 is the largest galaxy in a small group of four galaxies. Nearby galaxies include UGC 4867 and UGC 4871 and further away lie NGC 2785 and UGC 4889.

To date, Georg Brintrup wrote and directed about 30 \\"acoustical films\\" for various German radio stations. In 1979 he made his first film essay for television \\"Ich r√§ume auf\\" (Putting Things Straight), based on a polemic pamphlet of expressionistic poetess Else Lasker-Sch√ºler. The film has, as its topic, the exploitation and corruption of aesthetic productions.Monika M. Hielscher in MEDIUM, 10. Vol. 1980, book 5 \\"Poemi Asolani\\", which tells of the life and work of Italian composer Gian Francesco Malipiero, was made in 1985 and was his first \\"music film essay\\". This film has also been described as a \\"Musical without Songs\\" Prix Italia 1985, Cagliari, press release and has won several awards. The idea of this \\"music film essay\\" was to create a more sophisticated soundtrack with the intention to not manipulate or influence the audience on an emotional or subconscious level, which usually happens in motion pictures, but to give the audience the possibility to apprehend music on a conscious plane, comparable to the estrangement effect in the theatre of Bertold Brecht.Brecht, Bertoldt: Verfremdungseffekte in der chinesischen Schauspielkunst.

The first of these films, \\"Symphonia Colonialis\\" ‚ÄùM√∫sica mineira √© tema de filme‚Äù (Musical Tradition of Minas is Theme of a Film) in Estado de Minas, Segunda Se√ß√£o, April 7, 1991, deals with the origin of largely unknown Brazilian Baroque Music in Minas Gerais. In the second film, \\"O Trem Caipira\\", no word is spoken. \\"Pure Brazilian\\" music, from Bras√≠lio Itiber√™ da Cunha to Heitor Villa-Lobos to Radam√©s Gnattali, comments on Brazilian everyday life, revealing its own acoustic origins. The third film of the trilogy, \\"Drums and Gods\\" Cyntia Nogueira: No princ√≠pio, existia apenas o som ... (In the Beginning, there was just the Sound) in Correio da Bahia, Folha da Bahia, March 7, 2001, penetrates into the musical psyche of the Brazilian. A blind man and a street boy roam the city of Salvador, Bahia in search of the primal sound.

It has one of the largest SDRs and Voting Power in the IMF.Andre Melville, Yuri Polunin, Mikhail Ilyin (2011). Political atlas of the Modern World The country is a cultural superpower and it has close ties with the rest of the Catholic world as the home of the Pope. Italy is a key player in maintaining international security, especially in the wider Mediterranean region,The concept of Mediterraneo Allargato (Enlarged Mediterranean) includes the Horn of Africa, the Balkans and the MENA region by performing air policing duties for its allies and commanding multinational forces in foreign countries. The country has therefore developed considerable military capabilities by building two aircraft carriers and establishing some overseas military bases. The Italian navy was the first to launch an intermediate-range ballistic missile from the sea, an UGM-27 Polaris launched from the cruiser Giuseppe Garibaldi. The country is home to two nuclear bases and, as part of the NATO nuclear sharing program, therefore has a retaliatory nuclear capacity despite nominally being a non-nuclear state.According to the former Italian President Francesco Cossiga, Italy's plans of retaliation during the Cold War consisted in dropping nuclear weapons on Prague, Budapest and then on all eastern countries in case of a first strike of the Soviets against NATO members. He acknowledged the presence of U.S. nuclear weapons in Italy, and speculated about the possible presence of British and French nuclear weapons. Italy secretly developed its own nuclear weapons program, and one in collaboration with France and Germany, but abandoned such projects when it joined the nuclear sharing program.http://legislature.camera.it/_dati/leg05/lavori/stenografici/sed0073/sed0073.pdf The country has developed the ABM PAAMS system. It has developed several space-launch vehicles such as Alfa and more recently Vega. In more recent years, under the auspices of European space agency, it has demonstrated the reentry and landing of a spacecraft, the Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle. Italy is home of one of two ground operations centres of the Galileo global satellite navigation system. Italy contributes greatly to scientific research and operates some permanent research stations in Antarctica. In terms of spaceflight capability, the country owns the Broglio Space Centre. The country is a major contributor to the European Space Agency and the International Space Station. Italy's weakness and structural problems include: internal political instability, a large public debt, low economic growth in the last ten years and a significant Centre-North/South socio-economic divide.

Punch Aug 23, 1899, by J. S. Pughe The stages of Italian unification during 1829‚Äì71 Following the Risorgimento, the newly united Italy was recognized as the \\"sixth great power\\" by Austria, Prussia, France, Russia and the British Empire.\\"...Italy sixth great power\\" Italians achieved independence from Austria, the House of Bourbon and from the Pope, securing national unification.Martin Collier, Italian Unification 1820‚Äì71 (2003)Taylor, Struggle for Mastery pp 99‚Äì125 The papacy called France to resist unification, fearing that giving up control of the Papal States would weaken the Church and allow the liberals to dominate conservative Catholics. Italy captured Rome in 1870 and later formed the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria. In the same year, the coastal town of Assab on the Red Sea was taken over by the Italian government, becoming Italy's first overseas territory. Italy defeated the Ottoman Empire in 1911‚Äì1912.Charles Stevenson, A Box of Sand: The Italo- Ottoman War 1911‚Äì1912: The First Land, Sea and Air War (2014) By 1914, Italy had acquired Eritrea, a large protectorate in Somalia and administrative authority in formerly Turkish Libya. Outside of Africa, Italy possessed a small concession in Tientsin in China (following the intervention of the Eight-Nation Alliance in the Boxer Rebellion) and the Dodecanese Islands off the coast of Turkey. Austria took the offensive against the terms of the alliance and Italy decided to take part in World War I as a principal allied power with France, the UK and Japan. During the First World War, Italy occupied southern Albania to prevent it from falling to Austria-Hungary. In 1917, it established a protectorate over Albania, which remained in place until 1920.Nigel Thomas. Armies in the Balkans 1914‚Äì18. Osprey Publishing, 2001, p. 17.

The Fascist government that came to power with Benito Mussolini in 1922 sought to increase the size of the Italian empire and to satisfy the claims of Italian irredentists. In 1935‚Äì36, in its second invasion of Ethiopia Italy was successful and merged its new conquest with its older east African colonies. In 1939, Italy invaded Albania and incorporated it into the Fascist state. During the Second World War (1939‚Äì45), Italy formed the axis alliance with Japan and Germany and occupied several territories (such as parts of France, Greece, Egypt and Tunisia) but was forced in the final peace to abandon all of its protectorates. Following the civil war and the economic depression caused by World War II, Italy enjoyed an economic miracle, promoted European unity, joined NATO and became an active member of the European Union.Sara Lorenzini, \\"The roots of a 'statesman': De Gasperi's foreign policy,\\" Modern Italy (2009) 14#4 pp 473‚Äì484. Italy was granted a United Nations trust to administer Somaliland in 1950. When Somalia became independent in 1960, Italy's eight-decade experience with colonialism ended. For most of the second half of the 20th century the Christian Democrats dominated the Italian political landscape pursuing a foreign policy aimed at strengthening the East-West dialogue. As a consequence of that, Italy decided to build close relations with the Arab world and the USSR despite being part of the free world. In 1962, Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani favored the compromise between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cuban Crisis by removing the Jupiter ballistic missiles from Italian soil. In the 70s Foreign minister Aldo Moro signed a secret pact (known as the Lodo Moro) with the PLO, reversing the special status given to the Mossad of Israel by Alcide De Gasperi (the so-called Lodo De Gasperi). David Cameron, Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, Fran√ßois Hollande and Matteo Renzi. Italy is the least great power of the \\"Quint\\". In the 80s, under the leadership of the socialist Bettino Craxi, Italy acted as an aggressive regional power in the Mediterranean. Craxi warned Gaddafi of the 1986 United States bombing of Libya, allowing him to survive the attack, and ordered the Italian intelligence services to plan a coup d'√©tat in Tunisia supporting the installment of Ben Ali as the new president of the country. Giulio Andreotti was the last Christian democrat to serve as Prime Minister between 1989 and 1992. Despite being hostile to German reunification, he became one of the fathers of the Maastricht Treaty along with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand, often in contrast with Margaret Thatcher.

He is a current member of Wishbone Ash and is also known for his work with Pendragon and the David Cross Band.  Early life Crabtree began his drumming career at age 11 studying with a local self-taught drummer, Harry Hindle. It was while studying with Hindle that Crabtree was first introduced to the drumming of Dave Weckl via his instructional video The Next Step. Crabtree cites this as a defining moment in his understanding of what was possible on the drums. He started playing live shows at age 14, and began teaching drums to local drummers at age 15. Having taken up guitar at age 12, he also taught guitar to beginner students for a number of years. While studying physics at Durham University between 1998 and 2000, Crabtree wrote and recorded with original band Breakmaus. Breakmaus recorded two self-released albums, That White Door and Arrested, and made an appearance on Sky TV on the show Where It's At. Crabtree also played with many cover bands, small jazz bands, and the university big band while studying at Durham. Moving to London in 2004, Crabtree continued his drum studies with London musician Bob Armstrong, whose former students include Oasis's Alan White, and The Who's Zak Starkey (also the son of Ringo Starr from The Beatles).  Professional career  After moving to London in 2004, Crabtree played and recorded with numerous original bands, including a stint with Goldie co-writer Tim Philbert's original project Upsetta. In 2005, Crabtree joined former King Crimson member David Cross in the David Cross Band, which toured Japan, Italy and the UK resulting in the recording of Alive in the Underworld. Bass player Mick Paul recommended Crabtree to Colosseum guitarist James Litherland to play with 1970s folk band Jade for a reunion show. Litherland in turn passed Crabtree's name to Sunshine of Your Love lyricist Pete Brown, who then recommended Crabtree for the Xanda Howe band. In 2006, Crabtree joined Xanda Howe for a short tour along with Malcolm Bruce (son of Jack Bruce), with whom he later recorded. Also between 2006 and 2008, Crabtree became a member of Pendragon and completed two European tours, appearing on the DVDs And Now Everybody to the Stage and Jewel - Past and Presence.  Wishbone Ash  Crabtree performing on tour with Wishbone Ash. Crabtree joined Wishbone Ash in 2007 for the Power Of Eternity album and subsequent tour, replacing previous drummer Ray Weston. He co-wrote songs on the Elegant Stealth and Blue Horizon albums, the latter of which he co-produced and contributed a guitar solo to the song \\"Take It Back\\". He appears on the live DVDs Live in London, Live in Paris, and the rockumentary This Is Wishbone Ash as well as the live albums Argus Live, recorded live for Sirius XM radio, and the Roadworks series of releases. As of 2017, Crabtree has played over 1,000 shows with Wishbone Ash in 29 countries, including an arena tour of South Africa along with Deep Purple and Uriah Heep.  Teaching Having taught private students for many years, Crabtree began a short stint teaching at the Academy of Contemporary Music before having to leave in 2007 when the Wishbone Ash touring schedule coincided with term time. Inspired by how much he learned from DCI music videos, Crabtree set up an online drum school, JoeCrabtree.com, in 2006. The school has attracted more than 2,000 students, and his YouTube channel of drum lessons has garnered more than 5 million views. Outside of his own channels, Crabtree creates educational videos for the drumstick manufacturer Vic Firth's website. Crabtree also contributes articles to Modern Drummer and provides regular \\"Joe Knows\\" columns to Drumhead Magazine.  Software development Crabtree also creates musical software for Mac and PC, including RhythMachine, OctopuSequencer, Pyramid and PolyNome - The Ultimate Practice Tool for iOS.

In London with the support of Lord Aberdeen, Logan studied at the Royal Academy. He became a journalist, and then a clerk in an architect's office. He was employed for a time by the Highland Society of London, but never settled to a career. A brother of the London Charterhouse, he was expelled in 1866. With Scottish patrons, he sustained a fair standard of living, and died in London in April 1872. Works Highland Chiefs, illustration by James Logan from The Scottish Gael (1831) Logan's major work was The Scottish Gael, or Celtic Manners as preserved among the Highlanders (2 vol.), published in 1831. It was based on walking tours he had made in the Scottish highlands and islands during the previous decade, during which he collected Gaelic antiquities. The work was dedicated to William IV, illustrated by the author, and sold well on good reviews. In 1876 Alexander Stewart published a second edition.

Language The Umpithamu language belongs to the Paman subgroup of the Pama‚ÄìNyungan languages. By the early 2000s, there were only two completely fluent speakers of Umpithamu, one of them being Florrie Bassani. In July 2020, A Dictionary of Umpithamu was published, compiled by Flemish linguist Jean-Christophe Verstraete, with main language consultants Florrie Bassani and her niece Joan Liddy. People and country The Umpithamu were the southernmost group of the Kawadji or \\"sandbeach peoples\\" (in Umpithamu ma-yaandhimunu or \\"people who own the sandbeach\\".), followed in order to their north, by the Yintyingka, the Umpila, the Pontunj (Yankonyu) the Pakadji(Koko Yao) and the Otati(Wuta(h)i). Their territory embraced an estimated on the western coastline of Princess Charlotte Bay with its northern limits around Cape Sidmouth. History For some years in the 1950s a cattle station owner in Umpithamu territory had been complaining of the presence of this Aboriginal people on his grazing lands, and after successful lobbying, he managed to have them removed in 1961. The Umpithamu were deported, reportedly by a ruse that deceived them, by the local police from their home country around Port Stewart to the Aboriginal reserve near Bamaga, to their north. After decades they eventually managed to return south, to Coen, a mere from their tribal centre. Since then they have managed to set up three outstations in the Port Stewart area. They form one of the several peoples composing the Lama Lama people.

It is one of the main problems defined by Norbert Wiener 1942, Extrapolation, Interpolation and Smoothing of Stationary Time Series. A war- time classified report nicknamed \\"the yellow peril\\" because of the color of the cover and the difficulty of the subject. Published postwar 1949 MIT Press. http://www.isss.org/lumwiener.htmWiener, Norbert (1949). Extrapolation, Interpolation, and Smoothing of Stationary Time Series. New York: Wiley. . A smoother is an algorithm or implementation that implements a solution to such problem. Please refer to the article Recursive Bayesian estimation for more information. The Smoothing problem and Filtering problem are often considered a closely related pair of problems. They are studied in Bayesian smoothing theory. Note: Not to be confused with blurring and smoothing using methods such as moving average. See smoothing. Example smoothers  Some variants include:Simo S√§rkk√§. Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing. Publisher: Cambridge University Press (5 Sept. 2013) Language: English * Rauch‚ÄìTung‚ÄìStriebel (RTS) smoother * Extended RTS smoother (ERTSS) * Gauss‚ÄìHermite RTS smoother (GHRTSS) * Cubature RTS smoother (CRTSS)  The confusion in terms and the relation between Filtering and Smoothing problems There are four terms that cause confusion: Smoothing (in two senses: estimation and convolution), and Filtering (again in two senses: estimation and convolution). Smoothing (estimation) and smoothing (convolution) can mean totally different, but sound like they are apparently similar. The concepts are different and are used in almost different historical contexts. The requirements are very different. Note that initially, the Wiener's filter was just a convolution, but the later developments were different: one was estimation and the other one was filter design in the sense of design of a convolution filter. This is a source of confusion. Both the smoothing problem (in sense of estimation) and the filtering problem (in sense of estimation) are often confused with smoothing and filtering in other contexts (especially non-stochastic signal processing, often a name of various types of convolution). These names are used in the context of World War 2 with problems framed by people like Norbert Wiener. One source of confusion is the Wiener Filter is in form of a simple convolution. However, in Wiener's filter, two time-series are given. When the filter is defined, a straightforward convolution is the answer. However, in later developments such as Kalman filtering, the nature of filtering is different to convolution and it deserves a different name. The distinction is described in the following two senses: 1\\\\. Convolution: The smoothing in the sense of convolution is simpler. For example, moving average, low-pass filtering, convolution with a kernel, or blurring using Laplace filters in image processing. It is often a filter design problem. Especially non-stochastic and non-Bayesian signal processing, without any hidden variables. 2\\\\. Estimation: The smoothing problem (or Smoothing in the sense of estimation) uses Bayesian and state-space models to estimate the hidden state variables. This is used in the context of World War 2 defined by people like Norbert Wiener, in (stochastic) control theory, radar, signal detection, tracking, etc. The most common use is the Kalman Smoother used with Kalman Filter, which is actually developed by Rauch. The procedure is called Kalman-Rauch recursion. It is one of the main problems solved by Norbert Wiener. Most importantly, in the Filtering problem (sense 2) the information from observation up to the time of the current sample is used. In smoothing (also sense 2) all observation samples (from future) are used. Filtering is causal but smoothing is batch processing of the same problem, namely, estimation of a time-series process based on serial incremental observations. But the usual and more common smoothing and filtering (in the sense of 1.) do not have such distinction because there is no distinction between hidden and observable. The distinction between Smoothing (estimation) and Filtering (estimation): In smoothing all observation samples are used (from future). Filtering is causal, whereas smoothing is batch processing of the given data. Filtering is the estimation of a (hidden) time-series process based on serial incremental observations. = Related concepts = * Filtering (disambiguation) * Filtering problem * Not to be confused with Filter (signal processing) * Kalman filter most famous filtering algorithm in the sense of 'filtering problem' and 'smoothing problem'. * Smoothing (not to be confused with the Smoothing problem) * Smoothing (disambiguation)  See also  * Generalized filtering References Category:Bayesian estimation Category:Nonlinear filters Category:Linear filters Category:Signal estimation ","title":"Smoothing problem (stochastic processes)"},{"id":"53544527","text":"Giuseppe Mastinu (born 9 October 1991) is an Italian football player who plays for Spezia.

Ryder Miller in the Portland Book Review writes that \\"The Nebula, despite the recent proliferation of new awards, has remained a stalwart guide to what the field aspires to be. One can also get a sense of how the field has changed with recent works veering off into the fantastic in this Showcase.\\" While regretting the dearth of such traditional themes as \\"interstellar travel, journeys in time and encounters with extraterrestrials [and] the dream of a clear cut divide between good and evil,\\" he notes the emergence in the anthology of \\"new directions and genre hybrids [and] some interesting literary stories requiring a close or second reading [that] seem more appropriate for more mature audiences, but maybe one should not underestimate the young.\\" He notes the presence of \\"[s]ome big names\\" along with \\"new writers and disparate voices\\" and finds some of the pieces \\"oceanic, rather than cosmic.\\" He concludes that while \\"[o]ne is not likely to enjoy everything, ... there is a fair bit to be impressed by.\\"Miller, Ryder.

Made of Parian marble, the statue was restored from many fragments, but is lacking face, neck, forearms, part of left leg, toes and some fragments of drapery. It also had wings. The goddess is shown landing gently on her left foot, with the drapery blown against her body. The statue was excavated at Olympia in 1875‚Äì76 and originally stood near the temple of Zeus on a triangular 6-metre high pillar. Including the pillar, the statue stood at 12 metres. It has the inscription \\"The Messenians and the Naupaktians dedicated this statue to Zeus Olympios from the spoils of the wars. Paionios of Mende made it, who also won the competition to make the acroteria of the temple\\". That indicates the statue was installed to honour the recapture of Sphacteria from the Spartans in 425 BC. Through Greek mythology, it tells how the Nike of Paionios carries her himation, while she wears a chiton. The goddess is represented in descending flight, positioned upon a triangular pedestal about thirty feet high, she seems all but independent of support. Her draperies, blown by the wind, form a background for her figure. An eagle at her feet suggests the element through which she moves. It is said to inspire the sense buoyancy, speed, and grace. In the 2004 Athens Olympic medals the front side of the medal presents the statue of Nike Paionios with ancient Olympia in the backdrop, while the other side of the medal features the eternal flame framed by the first verse of the eighth Olympic Hymn (Olympic Anthem) by Pindar along with the logo of the Athens Games.The victory column in Olympia: The Nike of Paionios See also *Winged Victory of Samothrace References Category:1870s archaeological discoveries Category:5th-century BC Greek sculptures Category:Marble sculptures in Greece Category:Sculptures of Greek goddesses Category:Sculptures of women in Greece Category:Olympia, Greece ","title":"Nike of Paionios"},{"id":"53544575","text":"Danielle Clode is an Australian author of literary non-fiction, history and children's books.

Radio Feltham was the first prison radio station in Europe, operating in HM Prison Feltham, a male juvenile prison and Young Offenders Institution in west London that housed up to 800 boys between the ages of 15 and 21. It launched in 1994 thanks to the work of advertising executive Mark Robinson, who developed the idea of a radio station to support young prisoners when they were at their most vulnerable, alone in their prison cells at night. Radio Feltham eventually led to the founding of the award- winning charity the Prison Radio Association, and the development of the world‚Äôs first national radio station for prisoners, National Prison Radio.  Origins  The idea for a prison radio station was first mooted in 1993 by advertising executive Mark Robinson. It was in response to a spate of suicides, self-harm and violent incidents at HM Prison Feltham. Robinson approached Feltham prison governor Joseph Whitty and deputy governor Steve Guy-Gibbens to discuss the power radio could have in alleviating the ‚Äòisolation and the boredom of being locked up for 16 hours a day in single cells‚Äô by improving the accessibility of information within the prison. ‚ÄúThe radio station will make a real difference to the boys. It will help enrich their lives by giving them a mouthpiece, an involving occupation and the opportunity to practise new skills,‚Äù said Robinson in a 1994 interview in Campaign magazine. With the support of Whitty, Guy-Gibbens and prison officer Bob Clements, Robinson worked with the Home Office and Radio Authority to secure permission to transmit. Funding was not available through the Prison Service due to lack of evidence that the radio station‚Äôs impact would be positive and measurable, so Robinson sought the expertise of Roma Hooper, an experienced fundraiser. Local businesses and individuals donated funds, radio and telecoms equipment to facilitate the setup. Charitable trusts were then recruited to fund the development. A programming framework was developed that supported the prison‚Äôs key performance targets. This saw volunteer officers support the recruitment of young prisoners, aged between 15 and 21, to organise the programmes and the schedule, enabling them to learn new skills, including communication and interpersonal skills. The first prison radio show aired on 1 February 1994, using an induction loop system, much like hospital radio, to bring the station to every cell, on frequency 999 kHz, known as Radio Feltham, or Radio Feltz. Radio Feltham broadcast for 10 hours a day, with programmes covering cultural and religious interests, charity information, gym news, football updates, ‚Äòthe Agony Aunt‚Äô and music. The radio station became part of the small charity, Friends of Feltham (registered no. 1023442), the only charity running inside a prison at the time, supporting young offenders and their families.  Development  In 1996, with funding from City Bridge Trust and other sponsors, Radio Feltham opened its airwaves to the local community on 87.7FM, for one week, under a Restricted Service Licence. Its popularity led to additional broadcasts of increasing durations, with programmes covering educational and information based topics. BBC Radio 1 became involved with Radio Feltham in 1998, as part of the network‚Äôs commitment to communicating with extremely disadvantaged and socially excluded young people. Producers and news reporters were sent to Feltham to train the inmates in editing and news reading, building their skills in music and broadcasting. By 2000, Radio Feltham became the blueprint for new prison radio stations, including Radio Wanno at HMP Wandsworth. It attracted well-known visitors, including musician Pete Townshend, DJ Tim Westwood, who was a Radio Feltham patron, and footballer Tony Adams. In November 2004, Radio Feltham celebrated its 10-year broadcasting milestone by switching its transmitters from 999AM to 87.8FM. The station, run by young prisoners aged 15 to 21, expanded its usual in-house broadcast to offer a community service of music, news and information to Feltham, to a potential audience of one million residents within a 10 mile radius of HMP Feltham. Increased interest from prisons across England and Wales in engaging with prison radio led Roma Hooper and Mark Robinson to establish the Prison Radio Association (PRA) in 2006, a charity that offered guidance and expertise to prisons interested in setting up and running their own radio projects.

History  The original bakery was mentioned already in 1569 and its building dates back to the 14th century, when its location was at the Sporgasse 15 near the today's Stiegenkirche. In 1787 Mathias Tax bought the bakery and in 1880 Franz Tax III moved it to its current location and made it a prestigious bakery. During the imperial visit of Franz Joseph at Graz in 1883, the B√§ckerei Tax supplied the royal court. Due to the products quality, the bakery received a title of the Imperial and Royal Warrant of Appointment in 1888. The carved wooden shop portal that preserved to this day was made by the carpenter Anton Irschik from Graz in 1896. In 1940s Franz Edegger married Herta Tax and succeeded in reviving the bakery. After that, Erich Edegger, who was also the mayor of Graz, and his wife Walheide continued the tradition of court bakery. Today the company is run by his son Robert Edegger.

It produces tiles for tiled stoves and tile chimneys and the heat ceramics for the spas. The company was an Imperial and Royal Warrant of Appointment.  History  The ceramics manufactory Sommerhuber was first mentioned in 1491, when its name was W√§rmprecht. In 1843, Josef Sommerhuber (1817-1881) married the owner of the hut, and the name Sommerhuber was transferred to the craft business. His son Rudolf (1858-1935) took over the business after his father. Produced were stoves for the nobility, citizens and the peasants in baroque, renaissance and gothic style. Sommerhuber was allowed to equip the imperial palaces in Persenbeug and Nieder- Wallsee, and the offices in the entire monarchy. Customers abroad were Prince Arnulf of Bavaria, Prince Joachim of Prussia and Duke Albrecht of Bavaria. Also the royal castle Cotroceni in Romania was equipped by Sommerhuber. For this achievement Sommerhuber was appointed to the Imperial court supplier in 1900. At the Paris World Exposition in 1910, the company received the Silver Medal. In 1910 the company became the court supplier of Prince Ludwig Gaston of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Rudolf Sommerhuber worked together with famous artists such as Saibl, Barwig, Obsieger and Michael Powolny and designed the tiles of them. This tradition is also carried on today by collaboration with artists like Gerald Brandst√∂tter. The collapse of the monarchy in 1918 hit Sommerhuber, as an important sales market erupted. Nevertheless, the company continued to hold its own. During the Second World War, the company had to cease production and was largely spared the war. Nevertheless, the resumption of production on the basis of a lack of raw materials after 1945 was slow. In 1973 the company received the Bavarian Handicrafts Prize in Gold at the Handwerksmesse in Munich. New products such as the ceramic electronic storage have been developed. The oil crisis of the 1970s led to a strongly growing demand for wood-fired tiled stoves. In 1980 was built a new factory in Resthofstrasse, where the headquarters of the Sommerhuber manufactory are located. The production of interior ceramics and the wholesale trade, which were taken up in the 1980s, were abandoned for economic reasons. Sommerhuber concentrated on the heat ceramics. The company has been managed since 1993 by Rudolfs Ururenkel Christian (IV.) Sommerhuber (* 1959). Since 1998, the Sommerhuber manufactory has increasingly devoted itself to the development of large ceramics (with a length of up to 135 cm). Since 2005, the enJOY product line has also been offering heat ceramics for the spa sector in the form of electrically heated heaters, seats and benches as well as ceramic foot basins. The Sommerhuber manufactory currently employs around 120 people.

It is administratively part of the Ma'an Governorate. The village had a population of 691 in the 2015 census.  Etymology  The Arabic toponym, Mudawwara, translates approximately to \\"a large round thing\\" but does not refer to the many green, circular irrigated agriculture plots that can be found in the area, rather to a group of conical hills to the northwest of the modern town.  History  Mudawwara is first mentioned in the 9th century as one of the principal stops on the Syrian Hajj route. It appears to have been by-passed in the 14th century and is listed again in the 16th century. Transport and communications together with that all important of desert commodities, water, have been the raisons d'√™tre of this settlement for centuries. Mudawwara lies on the traditional trade-route that links with the wider Mediterranean world, the Levant and greater Syria with the Arabian Peninsula and Yemen. This route has been used for thousands of years by nomads and traders. From the seventh century onwards Islam spread across the North African coastal strip and through, what is today, the Middle East. The followers of Islam who were required to make the Hajj pilgrimage to the holy cities of Medina and Mecca travelled through this area along ancient routes. During the Umayyad period (661-750 AD) a route from Syria and Anatolia developed and passed through the settlements of Ma'an and Mudawwara. Mudawwara was thrust into modernity and the twentieth century with the arrival of the telegraph in 1900 connecting this remote outpost with the centre of Ottoman control in Constantinople. Shortly afterwards the Hejaz railway arrived in 1906 connecting it to Damascus, to the north, and Medina, to the south. T.E. Lawrence led an attack on the railway in Sept. 1917 during the Arab Revolt. Destroying a bridge along the line between Mudawwara Station and Hallat Ammar Station, the attack also took out 2 locomotives pulling 10 box wagons of Turkish soldiers. The result was 70 Turkish soldiers killed, 30 wounded and 90 taken prisoner. The station was captured during the Battle of Mudawwara on 8 Aug. 1918, along with 80 miles of Hejaz railway to Ma'an, and 7 stations.  The village  The modern village of Mudawwara has grown alongside the N5 Highway that heads southwards toward the border post with Saudi Arabia. It comprises low concrete block buildings and a few stores and vehicle repair shops. The many telecommunications towers link the village and the security posts to the administrative centres in Ma'an.  Ottoman Fort  The Ottoman Fort at Mudawwara A large stone fort, Qalat Mudawwara, was constructed in the 18th century by the Ottoman administration to afford protection to the hajj pilgrims. There are references to a fortification at this site as early as the 9th and 16th centuries. The first Western description of the fort is given by Charles Montagu Doughty in an account first published in 1888. He describes Medowwara (sic) \\"...the kellat Medowwara, where we came to water. The place lies very desolate; the fort is built at a spring, defended now by a vault from the Beduin's hostility. We felt the noon here very sultry and the sun glancing again from the sand we were between two heats. ...\\" This was used as a first aid post by Major Buxton during the attack on Mudawwara in August 1918 and was reused by Glubb Pasha during the mid-20th century. The fort was vandalised, in the 1980s, by looters using bulldozers looking for gold and causing the south elevation to collapse. Today, it can be found, in a state of imminent collapse, to the west of the station.  The Hejaz railway  The Hejaz railway, the pilgrim railway that linked Damascus with Medinah, arrived in Mudawwara in 1905. Mudawwara was an important stop as it was one of only six stations along the entire railway that had water reserves. A water tower comprising \\"two 50 cubic-meter iron tanks on a stone tower\\", wind and steam operated pumps were constructed to extract and store water.

Her 1926 translation of Schwejk from the original Czech into German (or what was known as Prager Deutsch or Pra≈æsk√° Nƒõmƒçina) was highly prized by many including Bertolt Brecht and Erwin Piscator in Berlin, who used it as the basis for a play in 1928. Reiner's work, Die Abenteuer des Braven Soldaten Schwejk was followed by an abridged English translation by Paul Selver in 1930. Reiner was born in Prague under the name Grete Stein. After her second marriage to Dr. Karel Reiner (1897 - 1943), she was also known as Grete Reinerov√° (Czech name) or Mark√©ta Reinerov√°, as well as Greta Reiner-Straschnow (because she had a son with her first husband JUDr. Oskar Straschnow, named Kurt (1911 - 1999)). Reiner was executive editor of an anti-fascist √©migr√© magazine in Prague called Deutsche Volkszeitung and was approached by Max Brod, editor of Franz Kafka's works, to translate The Good Soldier Schwejk. On its publication in 1921‚Äì23, Max Brod had immediately recognised Schwejk as a major work of literature, and had tried to translate a portion of it into German himself in the weeks following Ha≈°ek's death in 1923. Greta Reiner's full translation was published in 1926. Brod subsequently created a German play from the novel, collaborating with Hans Reimann. According to the Biographia Judaica Bohemiae, on 22 December 1942, Grete Reiner was deported to the Sammellager in Terez√≠n (Theresienstadt) as a result of the Nazi measures for the \\"final solution of the Jewish question\\", and from there on 6 September 1943, to KZ Auschwitz. Unless she fell victim to other abuse, Grete Reiner was gassed with the entire transport on the night of 8‚Äì9 March 1944. Much of the scant information about Grete Reiner comes from another writer in Prague at the time called Lenka Reinerov√° (no relation), who became the grande dame of Prague's German- language literature. At the age of 19 Lenka was asked to take Greta Reiner's place as editor of Deutsche Volkszeitung and was the only member of her family to survive the Holocaust.

According to Allee Simmons Jacobs McNamee, the community's long-time historian, preservationist, and also director of the SJM Group, in the beginning of the (black) cemetery, family and friends of the deceased would dig the graves and make homemade caskets, and had walking processionals to the cemetery (later, the casket was pulled by mules). The deceased were buried the next day with their heads facing east. This burial practice was used because most slaves felt they would obtain freedom after death and this position would cause them to be ready when the angel Gabriel would blow his trumpet at the resurrection. They used broken plates, saucers, jars, and pitchers as headstones. At the gravesite service, they sang songs such as \\"Go Down Moses‚Äù, ‚ÄúSwing Low, Sweet Chariot‚Äù, and ‚ÄúShine on Me‚Äù.

Characteristics  Grimmia pulvinata grows in small cushion-like shaped, around 1-2 centimeters tall. Its color ranges from a grey-green to an orange- yellow. Its leaves are lanceolate, being broad and oval shaped at the base and very narrow toward the tip. They may show a silvery hue near the tip in some specimens. Its capsules are oval shaped, and bend back into the leaves when the plant is dry, and stand out when it is moist.  Habitat  Grimmia pulvinata colonizes a variety of surfaces including rocks, concrete, and tree trunks. It is tolerant of a wide range of PH levels on surfaces, allowing it to live on many types of rock. However, it prefers surfaces such as old mortar and tree trunks.  Distribution  Grimmia pulvinata is the most common species in the genus Grimmia, with a nearly worldwide distribution. It is particularly common in Britain and the west coast of North America. It primarily lives in temperate regions, from sea level to elevations up to 9800 feet.  Ecological role  Grimmia pulvinata is a pioneer species, meaning it is among the first organisms to colonize habitat which has been disturbed by an event such as a forest fire. In addition, its resistance to pollution allows it to colonize urban areas such as roofs, walls, and tarmac.

The battalion is under the command of 41 Canadian Brigade Group, itself part of the 3rd Canadian Division, one of four region-based Canadian Army divisions. The battalion is made up of officers and soldiers primarily from the Corps of Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and the Royal Canadian Logistics Service and provides transport, maintenance, supply, food services and administrative support to 41 Canadian Brigade Group and other military elements in Alberta. Subunits * 14 Service Company - Calgary * 15 Service Company - Edmonton * Headquarters Company - Calgary / Edmonton History The history of 41 Service Battalion begins with the formation of No. 14 Company, Canadian Army Service Corps (CASC) in Calgary on April 1, 1910. In Edmonton, No. 22 Company, CASC, was formed in 1922. The battalion's lineage is complicated by the move from a horse-based military at its origins to the modern mechanized force of today. This has caused the formation of new corps such as the Royal Canadian Electrical Mechanical Engineers (RCEME) to maintain the complex equipment as well as the amalgamation of other corps such as the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps and Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps under the combined Logistics title. Through these changes, the battalion has served in communities across the province in peacetime as well as in almost every conflict including the First World War, the Second World War, peacekeeping and the conflict in Afghanistan. The largest change to the organization was the formation of the experimental service battalion concept in the mid-1960s which saw various corps being brought together in one organization including the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps (RCASC), the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps (RCOC), the Royal Canadian Army Pay Corps, the Royal Canadian Postal Corps and the Royal Canadian Electrical Mechanical Engineers (RCEME). Other corps, including Military Police and Medical have been included for short periods of time. The unification of the Canadian Armed Forces brought greater change with the merging of the RCASC and RCOC under the Logistics Branch. No matter the construct of the battalion, the goal has always been to provide combat service support to the units that it is tasked with sustaining during war, peace and during domestic emergencies. In 2017, 41 Service Battalion became associated the Clan McNaughton Pipes and Drums after many years of parading together at events in Edmonton.

Explanation The \\"diagram\\" of change ringing plain hunt on six bells. Two bells are shown. Plain hunting consists of a linear undeviating course of a bell between the first and last places in the striking order, with two strikes in the first and last position to enable a turn-around. On eight bells this is shown in the accompanying diagram below, where all the bells are plain hunting. The bells are written out in their striking order, and each sequence is a \\"change\\": Thus each bell moves one position at each succeeding change, unless they reach the first or last position, when they remain there for two changes then proceed to the other end of the sequence.Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, \\"Learning plain hunt\\" retrieved 20.3.2017 This simple rule can be extended to any number of bells, so that on 12 bells for instance, 24 unique changes can be obtained. Example ‚Äì plain hunt on eight bells 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8- start in rounds (rounds is the descending sequence of bells) 2 1 4 3 6 5 8 7 2 4 1 6 3 8 5 7 4 2 6 1 8 3 7 5 4 6 2 8 1 7 3 5 6 4 8 2 7 1 5 3 6 8 4 7 2 5 1 3 8 6 7 4 5 2 3 1 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ‚Äì reverse rounds 7 8 5 6 3 4 1 2 7 5 8 3 6 1 4 2 5 7 3 8 1 6 2 4 5 3 7 1 8 2 6 4 3 5 1 7 2 8 4 6 3 1 5 2 7 4 8 6 1 3 2 5 4 7 6 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ‚Äì finish in rounds =Limitations= Plain hunt is limited to a small number of possible different changes, which is numerically equal to twice the number of bells that are hunting. However, by introducing deviations from the plain hunt, by causing some of the bells to change their relationship to the others, change ringing \\"methods\\" were developed. These allow a large range of possible different changes to be rung; even to the extent of the full factorial sequence of changes. Used as a method building block 60 changes of the ringing method known as Plain Bob Minor. This has large blocks of plain hunting, and deviations from plain hunt only when bell no. 1 is the first. The diagram on the right shows how plain hunt is used as a building-block in other ringing methods. Bell number 1 is always plain hunting (shown in blue), and the other bells plain hunt but they change their pattern when bell number 1 is the first bell in the sequence. An example of one bell which is deviating from plain hunt is shown in red. This variation on plain hunt means that up to 60 changes can be rung without repetition in this case. There are thousands of ringing methods which incorporate blocks of plain hunt, and are only distinguished by different deviations at set points. These deviations define a particular ringing method in change ringing.

She was the first fireboat on North America's west coast. She was launched in 1891, as a long, wooden- hulled, steam-powered vessel. She was taken out of service, and rebuilt when Seattle completed its second fireboat, the Duwamish, in 1909. Her coal-fueled boilers were replaced with oil-fueled ones. The retrofit included altering her profile. She had a new superstructure, and the replacement of her boiler meant replacing her original single smokestack with a pair of smokestacks. She was replaced, in front line service, by the more powerful, gasoline powered Alki in 1927. Snoqualmie was demoted to patrolling Lake Union. Since Lake Union is not at sea level, fireboats stationed elsewhere have a long delay arriving at fires on or near Lake Union, because they have to transit canal locks. She was finally retired from service, in Seattle, in 1932, when the great depression made maintaining her too much of a burden. Seattle sold her in 1935, for her value as scrap metal -- $1,800. She nevertheless remained afloat, and in use, for almost another four decades. According to Alaska Shipwrecks: 1750 - 2010, the Snoqualmie was destroyed by a fire, in Kodiak, Alaska, on March 6, 1974. It stated that, after her retirement from Seattle, she had been re-used for a variety of purposes. Prior to the fire she was being used as a shrimp hauler. A coast guard vessel towed her away from a Kodiak re-fueling dock, to a point where she could be left to burn out without posing further danger. Observers said she burned for 36 hours.

(which represents about a quarter of world's market on beef, and holds the trademarks Friboi, Seara Alimentos (Seara Foods), Swift Armour, and Vigor) and the BRF company (which holds the trademarks Perdig√£o and Sadia) are accused of having mixed rotten meat treated with chemical components into meat sold in Brazil and abroad. As a first consequence, more than 30 meat inspectors were fired. They allegedly allowed rotten meat to be sold, dates of expiration to be altered, meat of poor quality to be disguised and mixed with potentially carcinogenic chemical substances, according to Ag√™ncia Nacional de Vigil√¢ncia Sanit√°ria (Anvisa), sorbic acid and the not for use authorized Vitamin C.

Slow-fading channel For example, the channel capacity for slow-fading channel is C = log2(1 + h2 SNR), where h is the fading coefficient and SNR is a signal to noise ratio without fading. As C is random, no constant rate is available. There may be a chance that information rate may go below to required threshold level. For slow fading channel, outage probability = P(C < r) = P(log2(1 + h2 SNR) < r), where r is the required threshold information rate.

Jaffee, M.D., FACR, FAACP Elizabeth M. Jaffee is an American oncologist specializing in pancreatic cancer and immunotherapy.  Education  Jaffee completed her undergraduate degree at Brandeis University in 1981 and earned her MD from New York Medical College in 1985. Following medical school, she did her residency at Presbyterian-University Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After residency she received a position as a research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh.  Career  In 1989, Jaffee started at Johns Hopkins University as a Senior Clinical Oncology Fellow and then went on to become the Assistant Professor of Oncology in 1992. Jaffee works as a medical researcher and Deputy Director at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center in Baltimore, Maryland. In addition, she is the Deputy Director of the Institute of Clinical and Translational Research as well as an oncology professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. She is the co-director of the Cancer Immunology Program, the Gastrointestinal Cancers Program, and Skip Viragh Center for Pancreas Cancer Clinical Research and Patient Care. Jaffee takes part in numerous leadership positions. She served as president of the American Association for Cancer Research from 2018 to 2019. She is also involved in the American Society for the Advancement of Science, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Association of Immunologists, the Society of Immunotherapy for Cancer, the Scientific Advisory Board of the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Philadelphia, the External Advisory Boards of both the Seattle Cancer Consortium Breast SPORE and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Head and Neck Cancer SPORE. Jaffee is the deputy director of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Co-Director at the Skip Viragh Center for Pancreas Cancer, deputy director of the Institute of Clinical and Translational Research, and professor of oncology and pathology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Her research is focused on immunological treatments for cancer. Jaffee is the chair of the National Cancer Advisory Board for the National Cancer Institute, of which she has been a member since 2013, and co-chair of the NCI \\"Blue Ribbon Panel\\" for the National Cancer Moonshot Initiative. She is a leader of the Stand Up to Cancer Dream Team for pancreatic cancer.  Research  Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee‚Äôs career is mostly focused on pancreatic cancer treatments. Her main point of interest is using immune therapies to help combat tolerance to cancers. These include utilizing treatments like novel immune checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines. Jaffee is a major leader in cancer vaccine therapy. According to the Boston Globe, Jaffee led a clinical trial on a vaccine, GVAX, that targets pancreatic tumors. With 3 out of the 14 patients in remission, Dr. Jaffee sees a lot of potential in this treatment style for the future. The vaccines would train the body‚Äôs immune cells to combat the cancer cells. If the vaccine is successful within a patient, it would prolong their life and prevent the pancreatic cancer from reoccurring for longer periods of time, therefore offering longer remission and a healthier lifestyle for the cancer patient. Furthermore, Jaffee holds 6 vaccine patents, some of which include: Diagnostic Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets For Pancreatic Cancer, Mesothelin Vaccines and Model Systems, Annexina2 as Immunological Target, and Prostate Stem Cell Antigen Vaccines and Uses Thereof. In 2007, Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee co-authored ‚ÄúCancer Immunotherapy: Immune Suppression and Tumor Growth‚Äù, a publication describing the current understanding of the immune system and its connection between the progression of cancer in the body. Additionally, Dr. Jaffee has aided in many research discoveries for pancreatic cancer. For instance, genomic and proteomic methods were established to see new signs of pancreatic cancer progression. With further research and development, Jaffee has hopes to make the protein, Annexin A2, not as overworked to prevent the advancement of pancreatic cancer in the body. Throughout her career, Dr. Jaffee has received numerous awards and achievements for her work and effort contributing to cancer research and treatment. Jaffee was the first ever recipient of the Dana and Albert ‚ÄúCubby‚Äù Broccoli Professorship in Oncology at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins. To continue, she is involved with many institutions including the National Cancer Advisory Board, the NCI NExT SEP Committee, the AACR Cancer Immunology Working Group (CIMM) Steering Committee, the Cancer Vaccine Collaborative (CVC). In 2010 and 2012, Jaffee worked closely as a co-organizer for the AACR Special Conference on Cancer Immunology. Currently, she hopes to incorporate technology, big data, and mathematics into the treatments of pancreatic cancer.

Pages 4-5. As an example of an raised bog, Blawhorn Moss is the largest and least disturbed area of peatland in the Lothians. As well as providing important habitat for wildlife, such as moorland breeding birds, healthy peatlands absorb carbon, forming what is often referred to as a natural carbon sink. In Scotland, peat soils are thought to contain nearly twenty five times more carbon than all other plant life in the UK. Yet very few raised bogs in Central Scotland remain undamaged, as most have been affected by drainage for farming, forestry or by extensive peat cutting. History  In the 1940s, the whole surface of Blawhorn Moss was drained to make the site more appropriate for agriculture.The Story of Blawhorn Moss National Nature Reserve. Pages 6. The moss then passed into the ownership of the National Coal Board: the surrounding areas were subjected to opencast coal mining, however the area of the current NNR remained intact. The Nature Conservancy Council (the predecessor organisation to NatureScot) purchased of the western part of the moss in 1979, since when the management of Blawhorn Moss has aimed at actively improving the habitat of the moss through blocking the man-made drains that had allowed the water table in the area to drop, and which had left the area more susceptible to drought and fire.The Story of Blawhorn Moss National Nature Reserve.

A primary goal of this initiative is to leverage existing and emerging standards within the Unmanned Vehicle (UxV) community such as the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) AS-4 Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JAUS) standard and the Army Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Project Office IOPs. The IOP was initially created by U.S. Army Robotic Systems Joint Project Office (RS JPO): and is currently maintained by the U.S. Army Project Manager Force Projection (PM FP). The plural form Interoperability Profiles (IOPs) typically refers to the set of documents, which comprise the IOP and its intended usage. The IOPs are approved for public release. The National Advanced Mobility Consortium (NAMC) makes the IOPs available at the https://namcgroups.org website for registered users.  Basic Concepts  From a system perspective, the IOP is defined to address interoperability at multiple levels within varying systems configurations, e.g.: * OCU/UxV(s): Between Operator Control Units (OCU) and one or more Unmanned Vehicles (UxV(s)) * Intra-OCU: Between and among OCU hardware and software elements. * Intra-UxV: Between and among UxV subsystems, payloads and platforms. * OCU/UxV/C2: Between OCUs, UxVs and external C2 systems to exchange command and control, battlespace and audio/video information. A key solution to this is the utilization of JAUS to establish a common message passing layer between the software components of the system. The IOP specifies rules for the use of standard JAUS messages as well as custom extensions to the standard message set. For the interoperability of hardware components, the IOP also includes the specification of hardware plugs and mounts. Versions The DoD intends to publish revisions to the IOP every other year. The current version is IOP version 2.0 (IOPv2). The release of version 3.0 is scheduled for the end of 2017. Since version 3.0 the whole set of IOP documents is auto-generated from XML files. Document Structure & Overview The IOPs consist of the following documents ;Overarching Profile: Provides the base concepts, architecture, requirements, and overview for the IOP; and specifically addresses platform, payload, mobility, on-vehicle network, communication, and logical interoperability messaging requirements. Additionally, this document introduces and presents the conformance and validation approach to be employed within the IOP. ;Capabilities Plan: Defines capability requirements related to the employment and usage of UGVs to perform current and relevant near-term robotic missions, in turn scoping and bounding the content of the IOP. ;SAE JAUS Profiling Rules: Specifies the manner in which the SAE AS-4 JAUS standards have been profiled, to include clarification or additional content to define interoperability between controllers and UGVs as well as intra-UGV (platform/subsystem) interoperability. ;Custom Services, Messages and Transports: Specifies additional SAE AS-4 JAUS messages and transport protocols required to support the scope of the IOP. Although titled ‚Äúcustom‚Äù, these messages are published and standardized within the IOP community with the end goal of transitioning to the SAE AS-4 JAUS standard(s) or other standards bodies for official adoption. ;Control Profile: Specifies the Operator Control Unit (OCU) logical architecture, standards, Human-Machine Interface (HMI) requirements, and conformance approach to include host application user interface requirements, such as mission planning and command and control. Although OCU concepts and high level architecture are touched upon in the Overarching Profile, the Control Profile provides the more detailed requirements to specify how interoperability is to be achieved for conformant controllers. ;Payloads Profile: Specifies the payload classification, standards, requirements, and conformance approach. Although these concepts are touched upon in the Overarching Profile, the Payloads Profile provides the more detailed requirements to specify the interoperability requirements for payloads with respect to the UGV platform. ;Communications Profile: Specifies the communications standards, requirements, and conformance approach. Although these concepts are touched upon in the Overarching Profile, the Communications Profile provides the more detailed requirements to specify interoperability requirements for communications between and among controllers and UGVs. ;Applique Profile: Specifies the appliqu√© systems classification, standards, requirements, and conformance approach. Although these concepts are touched upon in the Overarching Profile, the Applique Profile provides the more detailed requirements to specify the interoperability requirements for appliqu√© systems with respect to the unmanned ground systems, controllers, and base manned vehicle systems. Conformance Validation Tool To validate the conformance of UGV components to IOP attributes (JAUS Profiling Rules), TARDEC has developed a software tool called Conformance Validation Tool (CVT). The CVT is a client tool that checks the interface (JAUS messages) and protocol (state) of the required JAUS services. The CVT uses the original IOP XML-files to generate test messages. Thus, the CVT is considered to be the IOP reference implementation. Significance and Distribution =NATO= The NATO Team of Experts on UGV has recommended the IOP to become a NATO STANAG. The proposal is being considered by NATO Land Capability Group Land Engagement (LCG LE). To prove the applicability of IOP to military robots, the NATO Team of Experts on UGV conducted several interoperability exercises and demonstrations. =Commercial use= Several robotics companies already support IOP-compliant interfaces for their software or hardware products. =Academia= Several academic robotics contests, like the IOP Challenge of the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition or the European Robotics Hackathon (EnRicH) recommend or require IOP as a common interface definition. =Connection to other robotics middlewares= As IOP relies on the message passing architecture of JAUS, IOP-compliant software can be connected to other robotics middlewares through translating software bridges. Studies have shown, that IOP-compliant software can coexist with ROS- based robotics software.

It was established in 2016 and is the market leader in Europe among offset and gravure printing companies. The Bertelsmann Printing Group is one of eight divisions of Bertelsmann, the international media, service and education conglomerate.  History  In 2005, Bertelsmann and Axel Springer consolidated their gravure printing operations under the umbrella of Prinovis. Reasons for this included the industry-wide price decline and overcapacities. The Hamburg-based company was marked leader in Europe from the beginning. Bertelsmann indirectly owned 74.9 percent, with the subsidiaries Arvato and Gruner + Jahr each holding a 37.45 percent stake. Axel Springer owned the remaining 25.1 percent. In 2012, Prinovis became part of Be Printers, a newly- established division of Bertelsmann for the majority of the printing companies. This move was part of a larger reorganization of Bertelsmann under CEO Thomas Rabe who assumed his position in 2012. In 2015, Axel Springer sold its stake in Prinovis, making Bertelsmann the sole shareholder. In the process, Bertelsmann gained the opportunity to further streamline its printing operations. Shortly after the restructuring, Bertelsmann announced in 2015 the establishment of the Bertelsmann Printing Group, effective January 1, 2016. All printing companies of Be Printers and the printing operations previously belonging to the sister division Arvato were bundled under the umbrella of the new corporate group. Several other service and production businesses, e.g. storage media manufacturer Sonopress, followed. At the time of its founding, the Bertelsmann Printing Group earned annual revenues of some ‚Ç¨1.7 billion and had more than 8,000 employees. Independent of the merger, the brands of the individual printing companies, service and production operations remained intact. Over the course of the business year, it had a significant positive effect on the profit situation of the entire corporate group. In 2017, additional companies from the digital marketing business of Arvato have changed over to the Bertelsmann Printing Group.  Structure  Since 2016, the Bertelsmann Printing Group has been one of Bertelsmann's eight corporate divisions. It encompasses all of Bertelsmann's worldwide offset and gravure operations, as well as several other service and production businesses. The subsidiaries are AZ Direct, Berryville Graphics, Campaign, Coral Graphics, DeutschlandCard, GGP Media, MBS N√ºrnberg, Mohn Media, Offset Paperback Manufacturers (OPM), Prinovis, the rtv media group, Sonopress and Vogel Druck. Initially, the Bertelsmann Printing Group was led by Bertram Stausberg and Axel Hentrei as two equal Chief Executive Officers. Since Bertram Stausberg stepped down in the fall of 2016, Axel Hentrei has solely headed up the group. The headquarters are located in Carl-Bertelsmann-Strasse in G√ºtersloh. In total the group is active at 15 facilities in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Mexico and Asia.

Together with her husband Ivan Efimov she founded the tradition of Soviet puppet theater, acting as the driving force behind the Efimovs' presentations. Born in Saint Petersburg into a family with German-Jewish roots whose professionals included merchants, doctors, composers and academics, Simonovich-Efimova was highly educated, spending almost two decades studying art in both Russia and Paris to perfect her craft. Skilled in etching, watercolor and oil painting, she helped revive silhouette art in 20th-century Russia. Having performed in parlor theatricals as a child, from 1916 Simonovich-Efimova began staging puppet shows for fellow artists. The plays were so well received that she and her husband were invited to create a children's puppet theater by the Russian authorities in 1918, becoming two of the first professional puppeteers in Russia. She created innovative designs to make her manikins lifelike, promoting her work by publishing books and teaching puppetry theory and design. She and her husband are known as the first couple of Russian puppetry, though she was the one determined to elevate the craft. They performed over 1,500 shows throughout Russia between 1920 and 1940, moving from place to place with their traveling puppet theater. Inspired by the people she met and the countryside she experienced as they traveled across Russia, Simonovich-Efimova continued to paint throughout her life. While many of her scenes depict landscapes and historic architecture, she was also known for her works of women in traditional costume going about their daily lives. She also created a series of sketches while working at the First Mobile Hospital during World War II. Her works from the \\"Wounded Warrior\\" period sought to capture the courageous efforts of the soldiers she tended. Examples of her work are held in major Russian museums. Early life Nina Yakovlevna Simonovich was born on 21 January 1877 in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, to Adelaida Semyonova (n√©e Bergman) and Yakov Mironovich Simonovich (ru). Her maternal grandparents, Augustina (n√©e Gutsohn) and Semyon Bergman were merchants of German-Jewish heritage, who owned and operated their own mercantile business. Her father was a physician who worked in the typhoid wing of the Aleksandrovskaya Hospital and later at the Elizabeth Children's Hospital in Saint Petersburg. He also helped her mother publish the magazine Detskiy sad ( meaning kindergarten). Her mother, denied higher education in her home country, went to Switzerland, where she learned the methods of Friedrich Fr√∂bel before returning to Saint Petersburg where she opened the first kindergarten in Russia in 1866. Her mother's sister, Valentina Serova was Russia's first professional woman composer and her husband, Alexander was also a composer. Simonovich was one of six siblings. Her parents also helped raise her cousin, Valentin Serov, after his father died and Serov became estranged from his mother, as well as Olga Trubnikova, who would later marry Serov. Olga was the daughter of a former patient of Simonovich's father. The family adopted her in 1879, after her mother's death. Growing up in Saint Petersburg, Simonovich's first studied art under her cousin, Serov, with whom she trained between 1880 and 1890. From early childhood, Simonovich staged parlor theatricals, including shadow puppets in her performances. Between 1888 and 1896, she attended high school at the Gymnasium \\"M.N. Stoyunina\\" (). Career training Pavel Florensky, 1926 silhouette by Simonovich-Efimova Beginning in 1897, Simonovich taught at a boarding school in Tbilisi and gave art classes in a private school run by O.M. Shmerling. She left Tbilisi in 1899 and went to Paris where she studied drawing under Louis Charles Delescluze for a year, before returning to Moscow to take private painting courses with Elizaveta Nikolaevna Zvantseva, her cousin Serov, and attend classes at the Stroganov School. Simonvich returned to Paris in 1901 and studied painting with Eug√®ne Carri√®re through the end of the following year, learning the Impressionist style of masters such as Toulouse-Lautrec and Van Gogh. Back in Moscow in 1904, Simonovich enrolled in the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (). In 1906, she married fellow student Ivan Efimov, who was studying sculpture. The two continued their art studies at the Moscow School, taking a break between 1909 and 1911 for her to study with Henri Matisse in Paris, pending her graduation in 1911. The couple then traveled back to Paris briefly, before moving in 1912 to Lipetsk where they spent a few months on the Efimov family estate known as \\"Otradnoe\\". Her works in the period between 1911 and 1915 were of traditional composition and showed strong use of bold colors, particularly evident in her paintings of Russian peasants. Between 1910 and 1930, Simonovich-Efimova was a member of the Moscow Association of Artists (ru) (MTX) where she also exhibited her works. She became one of the main participants in the revival of the silhouette art at the start of the twentieth century, and also gained a reputation for etching. She presented silhouettes with restrained detail in theatrical performances similar to shadow plays, using blue cellophane to filter the light, unifying various shapes and adding luster to the overall effect. Some of her silhouettes were portraits, like her depiction of Pavel Florensky in 1926, which aptly captured his image, as well as his personality and dress. Her cousin Serov was a constant mentor to both of the Efimovs. They shared him as a teacher and followed his exacting standards to gain his somewhat rare approval.  Puppetry  The Efimov Traveling Theater in Moscow, May Day 1919 In 1916, volunteering to stage a puppet show for the MTX members, she created a play with five puppets based loosely on the Petrushka folk character. Petrushka is a roguish character who is often used to comment on contemporary society's social vices. The show was well received. She presented a repeat performance before receiving an invitation to stage the play once more at the Caf√© Pittoresque, a well-known cabaret. Having lost her jester-like puppet, she wrote two new plays and performed them with her husband. They were adaptations of Ivan Krylov's fables The Hermit and the Bear and Two Mice. She gave several other performances with her husband, at caf√©s, friends' homes and at the Hermitage Theatre between 1916 and 1918. The events of the October Revolution convinced Simonovich-Efimova that she could no longer paint because easel painting did not serve a \\"beneficial purpose\\". Simonovich-Efimova's career turned toward professional puppetry, creating a mobile theater, with the purpose of providing a joyful distraction to the civil war. The Efimovs began traveling and performing as itinerant puppetmasters, visiting venues seldom encountered by traditional theater performers. Giving over seventy shows in Moscow and the surrounding area, they traveled up and down the Kama and Volga Rivers over the summer months, performing their version of Petrushka and of Krylov's fables. By the fall of 1918, the couple's popularity resulted in their being invited to set up a children's theater in line with the government's socialist restructuring policy. Her husband arranged for the theater in the Mamonovski Passage to be dedicated to puppet productions. By focusing on children's productions, the Efimovs avoided government pressure to perform communist-oriented themes. Simonovich-Efimova developed glove puppets and shadow puppets to re-enact fables and fairy tales based on the works of Krylov and Hans Christian Andersen. They included adaptations of traditional themes such as the Mena stories, Baba Yaga, Shrovetide, and Nikolay Nekrasov's Peasant Children. In a second theater, they staged marionette productions. The Effimovs put on twenty shows per month for the next eight months, while simultaneously performing with their traveling theater. The theater in the Mamonovski Passage then closed, marking their last engagement in a permanent location. For the next six years, the couples' main means of support came from the traveling theater. Between 1916 and 1924, sometimes assisted by their son Adrian, the couple staged around 600 performances. They were able to help people forget the famines and violence of the times. Simonovich-Efimova performed in children's hospitals and mental asylums, contributing to her family's history of philanthropy. Cover of Notes of a Petrushkanist by Simonovich-Efimova (1925) Wishing to complement her involvement in performance, Simonovich-Efimova began publishing works \\"to establish puppetry's validity as a unique discipline\\" within the visual arts realm. She published books and pamphlets on design and movement, including a history of the art and descriptions of the contributing puppeteers. One of her best known works, Notes of a Petrushkanist (, 1925) gives details of her performances and theories, together with drawings and texts of her plays. In 1930, she spoke at the first USSR Soviet Puppet Theaters Conference presenting her ideas on puppetry. She disavowed claims that puppets are lifeless automatons, maintaining that the puppeteer must convince the audience they are alive. The artistry in creating vitality involved an intimate connection between puppet and puppetmaster, a feat she felt could not be achieved in the same way with marionettes. She viewed the connection between manikin and manipulator as symbiotic collaboration: rather than the puppeteer forcing choreography upon the puppet, the doll's limitations helped the puppeteer learn to communicate in new ways. The lack of facial expressions must be compensated by gesture. Unlike an actor who interacts with other performers, the puppet communicates both with the other actors and the puppetmaster himself. In 1935, Simonovich- Efimova's Notes was translated and published in English, as The Adventures of a Russian Puppet Theatre, bringing her ideas to international attention. As a result, her theories and techniques became influential in the United States with several university instructors mimicking her techniques for the classroom and at conferences. In 1940, she published additional designs and theories of manikins in Rod Puppets (sometimes translated as Dolls on Canes) (). Puppetry design, construction of a cat, by Nina Simonovich-Efimova Pushing design to the limits, Simonovich-Efimova created puppets to be worn on the head, allowing the puppeteer to manipulate several characters simultaneously. She patented a new type of rod puppet with rods attached to the elbows to free up the hands. The rods were hidden behind hanging costumes. To make puppets look more lifelike, the Efimovs devised a system where the arms were elongated. Rods rather than the puppeteer's fingers were inserted into the glove to manipulate the arms, which were allowed to move by manipulating strings inside the body of the doll. Simonovich-Efimova utilized other apparatus, like springs in the body of a cat puppet to give it the flexibility of a live animal. These innovations allowed their finely formed, elegantly clad puppets to move about naturally, rather than with the stiff, jerky movements of their predecessors. In an era when almost all puppet performances were designed to entertain children or present government ideology, Simonovich-Efimova went out of her way to perform shows for adults, including The Enchanted Pear Tree, Macbeth, and works by Moli√®re and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. Though she also made adaptations in her work with fables to replace what were seen as outmoded ideas, like replacing serfs with young communist characters, Simonovich- Efimova's focus was on artistry, entertainment and professionalism. She also developed a new system of life-sized manikins, blurring the lines between puppetry and acting, when she danced on stage with her Petrushka. Between 1920 and 1940, the Efimovs performed between 1,500 and 2,000 puppet shows.  Return to painting  Anna Golubkina. Portrait of Nina Efimova (1907) As they were traveling with the theater, Simonovich-Efimova's interest in painting rekindled. She was inspired to depict women in their regional dress digging potatoes, comforting their children, or attending fairs and festivals. She painted pictures of women and girls in 1924 and again in 1926 while in Lipetsk; colorful images with reds, greens and ambers in a noted series called \\"Tambov women\\"; picturesque scenes from Bashkiria and Udmurtia; and a critically acclaimed series created in Crimea and Novgorod. The Novgorod paintings began in a period when the Effimovs had fled Moscow in 1935 because of political turmoil. During this time, purges of 1933 and the party restructuring that followed in 1935, bureaucrats, corrupt officials, shirkers and those who sought personal gain over state benefit were targeted, rather than previous purges which had focused upon bourgeoisie elements. Even if one were not a target of the purge, a broad range of society was effected, because the purges were aimed at eliminating all those affiliated with a targeted party member. Fear of arrest, denunciation, or extortion, created uncertainty for every strata of society. The paintings from the period comprise mostly landscapes of the area surrounding the city and ancient buildings, where Simonovich-Efimova walked to enjoy the peace of her surroundings. Beginning in 1928 and continuing until 1942, Simonovich-Efimova taught techniques of shadow theater in courses at the House of Art Education, named after Nadezhda Krupskaya. She also taught at Moscow's Museum for the Protection of Maternity and Infancy, the Union of Theatre Workers of the Russian Federation and the variety theater of the Mosesstrana. In the 1930s, she worked as an interior designer for some of the public buildings of Moscow and created moving silhouette compositions for the Central Museum of Ethnology and the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (ru) (). In the mid-1930s Simonovich-Efimova's composition From the Moscow Noble and Merchant to the Moscow Socialist was installed at Gorky Park. When the Great Patriotic War broke out in 1941, the Efimovs refused to leave Moscow, though the winter of 1941‚Äì1942 was bitterly cold. Simonovich-Efimova worked in the Lefortovo District at the First Mobile Hospital tending to wounded soldiers and writing letters for them to their families and comrades. In a series of drawings called \\"The Wounded\\", she drew portraits of the soldiers trying to capture their courage, noting their injuries and their addresses on the backs of the drawings. Some of the drawings she would work up in oil or watercolor, spending most of the daylight hours at the hospital. In the evenings, the couple worked on puppetry, preparing concerts and puppet shows for the troops based on historic and patriotic themes. They also allowed artists to take refuge at their home and work the small garden to supplement their food. They trained and rehearsed their actors daily, though finding male actors was difficult, compounded by gas and electrical shortages. Simonovich-Efimova also compiled a memoir of her cousin and teacher Valentin Serov, though her book, Memories of V. A. Serov () was not published until 1964. Death and legacy Simonovich-Efimova died on 24 February 1948 in Moscow, Soviet Union. Posthumously, she was inducted into the International Academy of Puppeteers for her innovations in life-sized puppets. The couple are known as the Adam and Eve of Russian puppetry. She left a large legacy, including around 3,000 works, some of which are housed in a memorial workshop at their former home, though art historians mostly ignored her work until the end of the 20th century. Her works can be seen in the permanent collections of the Russian Museum, Tretyakov Gallery, the Tver Regional Art Gallery, among others. There have been posthumous solo exhibitions of her work in 1959, 1968 and 1975. In 2011, The Museum of Russian Art (TMORA) in Minneapolis, Minnesota included some of her ethnic paintings of women in their native dress. The following year, her 1935 book, Adventures of a Russian Puppet Theatre: Including Its Discoveries in Making and Performing with Hand-Puppets, Rod-Puppets and Shadow-Figures (English version) was reprinted by Martino Publishing. The Efimova crater on Venus is named after Simonovich-Efimova.

The Fourmiles only played a small role in the film, which focused on George and Mildred celebrating their wedding anniversary, at Mildred's insistence, at an upmarket London hotel. It featured several guest stars including Stratford Johns, Kenneth Cope and Vicki Michelle. The film was neither a critical nor box office success.Julian Upton, \\"Carry on Sitcom: The British Sitcom Spin-off Film 1968-1980\\", Bright Lights Film Journal, no. 35, January 2002. It was shown on ITV on Christmas Day 1980. The end The final caption of the George and Mildred film read \\"The End - or is it the beginning?\\" It was to prove to be the former as Yootha Joyce died from portal cirrhosis of the liver due to chronic alcoholism on 24 August 1980, before the film was released. Friends and colleagues were unaware that Joyce had been habitually consuming half a bottle of brandy every day for over 10 years. In 2004, on an audio commentary on the Australian Umbrella DVD release of George and Mildred: the Complete Series 2, Brian Murphy revealed that there had been plans for a sixth series of eight episodes of the show. These were to have been recorded in late 1980. Murphy also revealed that this was due to have been the final series of George and Mildred, as he and Yootha Joyce were afraid of being typecast after playing the characters since 1973 on television and in two films. However, despite scripts being written, Joyce's hospitalisation and subsequent death brought a premature end to the show. Her funeral took place on the day the cast were due to begin rehearsals for the new series. Speaking of their relationship in a 2001 ITV programme, The Unforgettable Yootha Joyce, Murphy said that when they had first met at Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop he had, \\"always regarded Yootha as very stylish and very confident. I was rather over-awed by her at first, full of admiration for her. \\"At her death, \\"People said, 'You've lost a working partner' and I said, 'No, I've lost a chum'... and then I realised I've lost my working partnership as well...\\". Thames Television did consider producing a spin-off for the character of George, looking at him cope with life as a widower. However, this project did not materialise, though Brian Murphy did reunite with George and Mildred co-star Roy Kinnear and writers Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke for The Incredible Mr. Tanner, a comedy produced by Thames Television in 1981.

The building's design, by architect George Henry Griebel, blends polychrome brickwork, terra cotta and metal over a limestone base. The building was designated a New York City Landmark in 1992. History In 1879, liquor store owner Herman F. Ahrens purchased two properties at the corner of Elm and Franklin Streets from the William Briggs estate. The property contained two frame structures, a larger one at the corner (40 Franklin Street) and a smaller one facing Elm Street, where Ahrens moved his liquor store. In 1881, a municipal project to widen Elm Street would have forced the demolition of Ahrens' properties, leading him to develop the present-day Ahrens Building as a speculative development. Construction was briefly halted, after union workers walked off the job after learning of non-union steamfitter workers were involved in construction of the building. The Sprague Electric company installed six elevators for the building on February 16, 1895. The Ahrens Building remained in the Ahrens family until 1968, when Morris and Herbert Moskowitz acquired the property. After the sale of the building, the upper floors (which were used as storage space since the 1940s) were renovated back to office space. The ground floor has housed several bars and restaurant since the 1960s.

Confederate forces tried to surprise Union forces near Legareville on Johns Island but failed to destroy the federal forces or drive them away from Legareville. Confederate Preparation Major Edward Manigault (brother to Brig. Gen. Arthur Middleton Manigault), commanding the South Carolina Siege Train or Manigaults Battalion wrote the only in depth record of confederate artillery preparation in his diary, even though he was never present for their construction. He reported that there were 5 artillery positions, the 1st Upper Battery commanded by Capt. Benjamin C. Webb of Company A, South Carolina Siege Train with two 30-lb. Parrot Guns, the 2nd Upper Battery commanded by 1st Lt. Ralph Nesbit of Company B, South Carolina Siege Train with two 8-inch Siege Howitzers, the Lower Battery commanded by Captain Frederick C. Schultz of Company F, 3rd SC Artillery Battalion with two 3.5-inch Blakely rifles, one 10-pdr Parrott, along with an 8-inch howitzer, the Legareville Road Battery commanded by 1st Lt. John P. Strohecker of the Marion Light Artillery with two 12-lb. napoleons, and the Inglis Light Artillery Battery commanded by Capt. William E. Charles with two 3.5-inch Blakey Rifles and two 12-lb. howitzers. The artillery batteries all fell under the command of Lt. Col. Delaware B. Kemper. But the artillery and infantry elements both had different commanders, which did not allow the surprise that had been planned for Christmas 1863 to follow through like it had been planned. Col. Powhatan R. Page of the 26th Virginia Infantry had two companies of his own regiment and five of the 59th Virginia Infantry and commanded them as the infantry element of this force. Union forces in the area A small force of some 200 infantrymen from the division of Brigadier General George Henry Gordon. They occupied the area just outside of Legareville and had support from only one union navy vessel, the USS Marblehead. The Marblehead was under the command of Lieutenant Commander Richard Worsam Meade, the nephew of Major General George Gordon Meade. The Marblehead boasted a XI-inch Dahlgren Gun, two 24-lb smootbore guns, and one 20-lb rifle. Further down the Stono River, which ran along Johns Island past Legareville and into the Atlantic, two other gunboats were posted near the Stono Inlet. They were the USS Pawnee, commanded by George Balch and with the firepower of eight IX-inch Dahlgren guns, one 100-lb Parrot Rifle, one 50-lb Dahlgren Rifle, and two 12-lb boat howitzers. The other boat was the USS C. P. Williams, a mortar schooner that mounted a couple 8-inch mortars and was under the command of Acting Master S. N. Freeman. Opening Battle At around 6 am on Christmas morning the howitzers of the 2nd Upper Battery opened fire and not long afterwards the lower Battery opened fire as well, but their fire was ineffective. When artillery fire started, Union Lieutenant Commander Richard Meade, wearing only his nightclothes, ordered his men to respond with artillery fire. With steam in only one of the Marblehead's boilers, the ship lifted anchor and maneuvered downstream and continued to fire on the confederates. Despite Confederate accuracy and casualties among the gun crew, Boatswain's Mate William Farley, captain of the XI-inch pivot gun, got off the Marblehead 's response. Meade's servant, escaped slave Robert Blake, even helped with the guns after a crew member was shot down. One crew member, Charles Moore, was wounded and bleeding profusely, but refused to leave and continued to help with artillery efforts. Quartermaster James Miller then stepped up to the foredeck and cast the lead and led the ship safely away, saving it from possible destruction of running aground. Acting Ensign George Winslow also helped to rally the crew to the guns. Later Stages The remaining guns of the 1st Upper battery, the Legareville Road Battery, and the Inglis Light Artillery Battery opened fire on the union forces in town. Even though the confederates had an advantage, Colonel Page refused to advance the infantry until the Marblehead was disabled. Instead of advancing Page tried to induce the small detachment to surrendered but failed because of the fact that the Marblehead was still in action. By this time the Pawnee and C. P. Williams were moving into action. At 6:35 the C. P. Williams was enfilading confederate positions. With the Pawnee joining in, the union bombardment completely disrupted the confederate artillery. By 7:30 am the confederates stopped firing, and the federals followed soon afterwards. Colonel Page soon order the withdrawal of confederate forces. Lt. Colonel Delaware Kemper had to leave two 8-inch howitzers behind. He had his men wait behind Abbapoola Creek to recover them but fire from the C. P. Williams refused them the chance to regain them. Aftermath Union casualties were 3 killed and 4 wounded, compared to confederate 3 killed and 8 wounded. After the battle, Colonel Page blamed poor artillery for the inconclusive battle. Delaware Kemper defended his men with the fact that the range did not allow their fire to accurately disable the Marblehead. With his report, General P. G. T. Beauregard took both accounts in. He reported that \\"The failure to destroy or drive away the Marblehead is due to the inefficiency of the artillery through bad ammunition, fuzes, and primers, and bad service of the guns. The 8-inch howitzers, objected to by Lieutenant-Colonel Kemper, were intended to kill the enemy.\\" Unknown to the confederates, their artillerists fired with some degree of accuracy. The Marblehead recorded 30 hits. \\" We have one 30-pounder shell that was lodged in the steerage and did not explode ...\\" Meade recorded two other unexploded shells lodged in the ship. Overall Meade reported extensive, but largely superficial, damage. Eventually, Farley, Miller, Blake, and Moore (who was not in Meade's recommendations) received the Medal of Honor for their actions on Christmas Day 1863. References *Manigault, E., & Ripley, W.

Built in 1898, the town hall is a prominent local example of Colonial Revival architecture, and the assemblage form an imposing civic statement in the village center. The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Description and history The town of Cheshire is a small rural community in central Berkshire County, Massachusetts. Its main village is located near the western bank of the Hoosic River, just north of the Cheshire Reservoir. Its municipal complex is located on a triangular parcel bounded on the north by Church Street and the south by Depot Street. Prominently facing the intersection is the town hall and library, a cruciform two-story brick building with a hip roof and Colonial Revival features . Just behind it is a small single-story building housing the building department offices, whose originally function was as a ticket office and waiting room for the local street car. Across the parking lot, at the eastern end of the property, is a two-story brick building, which formerly housed the trolley power station but now houses the town police and fire offices. The parking area is where the Berkshire Street Railway originally turned around. In the triangular grassy area at the front of the town hall is a memorial fountain to the town's Revolutionary War participation, and there is also a monument honoring the town's World War I soldiers. The town's 19th-century town hall, a wood-frame building, was located on State Road near the Baptist church; it is no longer standing. This town hall was built in 1898, after the state mandated town records be stored in fireproof vaults. At the same time, the Cheshire Library Association, a private library founded in 1866, was seeking a larger space for its collection. The new building was designed by Emory Ellsworth. The two former trolley buildings were built sometime after 1904, for service that had been inaugurated in 1902. Service on that line was discontinued in 1932, and the town purchased the two buildings in 1935. The ticket office became the town post office in 1937, and served that role until 1971. The power building was occupied by the town's fire and police functions in 1935.

Stereocontrolled 1,2-additions to carbonyl groups (especially ketones) are an important class of reactions because they provide access to substituted alcohols, generating a new stereocenter in the process. Especially widespread are various reagents for stereocontrolled 1,2-hydride additions (or reductions) of ketones. A well-known method to synthesize enantiopure alcohols by ketone reduction is the Midland Alpine borane reduction, named after its inventor Professor M. Mark Midland.Midland, M. M.; Lee, P. E. J. Org. Chem. 1985, 50, 3239 ‚Äì 3241. The strategy uses a chiral organoborane, derived from the hydroboration of alpha-pinene by 9-BBN, to differentiate enantiotopic faces of a ketone. Following workup with basic hydrogen peroxide, the product alcohols can be obtained, often with high degrees of enantioselectivity. The reaction works best if one of the ketone groups has low steric hindrance, such as an alkyne or nitrile. Another method, first developed in the 1980s, is called the CBS (Corey‚ÄìBakshi‚ÄìShibata) reduction, and it features the use of an oxazaborolidine catalyst along with borane as a reducing agent for accomplishing enantioselective ketone reductions. The CBS reduction has been used extensively by chemists en route to synthesizing a wide variety of natural products, including alkaloids, terpenoids, pheromones, and biotins.Cho, B.

Fujimura was also known for his influential work in the diverse field of speech-related studies including acoustics, phonetics/phonology, instrumentation techniques, speech production mechanisms, and computational/theoretical linguistics. After getting his Doctorate of Science from the University of Tokyo through the research he conducted at MIT, Fujimura served as Director and Professor at the Research Institute of Logopedics and Phoniatrics (RILP), at the University of Tokyo from 1965 to 1973. He then continued his research at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, in the U.S., from 1973 to 1988 as a Department Head, working for Max Mathews. He moved his research to The Ohio State University where he was Professor and Department Head for Speech and Hearing Science. He was named Professor Emeritus in 2013. He was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences.  Biography  Fujimura's career as a scientist spanned nearly three quarters of a century. He authored, co-authored or edited over 256 scientific publications covering a vast range of topics including physics, speech acoustics and articulation, phonology, kanji transcription methods, syntax, and more. These included 11 books and monographs, 64 journal articles, 58 articles or chapters in books, 56 proceedings articles, 42 miscellaneous writings and 25 articles in RILP. Fujimura‚Äôs work covers all aspects of phonetics, with a focus on speech articulation, analysis of acoustic phonetics, and speech perception. Fujimura and his colleagues introduced X-ray technologies to study human articulation patterns.Kiritani, S., Itoh, K. & Fujimura, O. \\"Tongue-Pellet Tracking by a Computer-Controlled X-ray Microbeam System\\", Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 57, 1516-20, 1975. The X-ray macrobeam speech corpus is considered to be an important research resource for modern phonetic research. His work contributed to the foundation of modern acoustic analyses of speech sounds, especially the acoustics of nasal consonants, proposing the notion of the ‚Äúanti- formant‚Äù.Fujimura, O. \\"Analysis of Nasal Consonants\\", Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 34, 1865-75, 1962. His work also showed that consonant-to-vowel transition is perceptually more salient than vowel-to- consonant transition.Fujimura, O., Macchi, M. J. & Streeter, L. A. \\"Perception of Stop Consonants with Conflicting Transitional Cues: A Cross-Linguistic Study\\", Language and Speech 21, 337-46, 1978. In addition to his contribution to phonetic science, he wrote a review of ‚ÄúSyntactic Structures‚Äù by Noam Chomsky in 1963, thereby contributing to the introduction of generative linguistics in Japan.Fujimura, O. \\"Chomsky no Syntactic Structures ni tuite (On the Syntactic Structures by Chomsky)\\", Journal of the Linguistic Society of Japan (Gengo Kenkyuu) 44, 14-24, 1963. Later in his career, he proposed a model of speech articulation called ‚Äúthe C/D model‚Äù, in which phonological featural specifications are ‚ÄúConverted‚Äù and ‚ÄúDistributed‚Äù to several articulators.Fujimura, O. \\"The C/D model and prosodic control of articulatory behavior\\", Phonetica 57, 128-38, 2000. The C/D model is an explicit theory of how mental, phonological information is mapped onto actual physiological articulatory commands. This theory is currently being pursued by a number of phoneticists. His first position was Research Assistant at The Kobayashi Institute of Physical Research, Kokubunzi, Tokyo from 1952 ‚Äì 1958. He then served as Assistant Professor at the Research Laboratory of Communication Science in the University of Electrocommunications at Ch≈çfu, Tokyo from 1958 to 1965. From 1958 to 1961 he worked at MIT as Division of Sponsored Research staff member at the Research Laboratory of Electronics (Speech Communication Group). At MIT he was supervised by Drs. Morris Halle and K. N. Stevens. This was followed by two years (1963 ‚Äì 1965) as a Guest Researcher at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, where he was supervised by Dr. Gunnar Fant. During this time, he conducted research that contributed to the foundation of modern acoustic analyses. He obtained his D.Sc in Physics from the University of Tokyo in 1962. Starting in 1965, he served as a professor at the Research Institute of Logopedics and Phoniatrics in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Tokyo. He served as the director of the Institute between 1969 and 1973, during which time he published many important phonetic research papers. Concurrently in 1973, he also was Adjunct Professor, Dept. of Linguistics, Faculty of Letters, at the University of Tokyo, and also Chair of the Graduate Course in Physiology (in the Division of Medicine), the University of Tokyo. It was during this time that RILP became an active research center for speech science studies, focusing on developing highly advanced techniques and tools for studying articulation of speech, including fiberoptics, EMG (electromyography) and the X-Ray Microbeam. Some studies conducted at RILP during this time are considered to be foundational to modern phonetics science, and still cited in current phonetics papers. In 1973, he moved to AT&T; Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ, USA. At Bell Labs he served as the head of the Department of Linguistics and Speech Analysis Research until 1984, the head of Department of Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence Research until 1987, and the head of Department of Artificial Intelligence Research until 1988. During this time Fujimura worked with a number of scientists and is remembered for encouraging young researchers including Mark Liberman, Janet Pierrehumbert, William Poser, Mary Beckman, Marian Macchi, Sue Hertz, Jan Edwards, and Julia Hirschberg. Fujimura‚Äôs broad vision about the entire field of linguistics is evident in his impact on post-doc researchers at Bell Labs such as John McCarthy, a formal phonologist, and Barbara Partee, a formal semanticist. In 1988, Fujimura moved to the Department of Speech & Hearing Science at The Ohio State University where he worked until retiring as a Professor Emeritus in 2003. During his time at OSU, he was also a Member at the Center for Cognitive Science (1988 to 2003), and a Participating Professor at the Biomedical Engineering Center (1992 to 2003). In addition he was a periodic Guest Researcher at ATR/HIP in Japan from 1992 to 1996. From 1997 to 1998 he took sabbatical leave from OSU to be a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Invitation Fellow at the Research Institute of Asian and African Languages and Cultures at the Tokyo University for Foreign Studies. Fujimura served as a fellow for the International Institute for Advanced Studies from 2004 to 2006. It was during this time that Fujimura began to formulate the C/D model of speech articulation while mentoring researchers such as Reiner Wilhelms Tricarico, Chao-Min Wu, Donna Erickson, Kerrie Beechler Obert, Caroline Menezez, and Bryan Pardo. After retirement from OSU, he was a researcher at the Center of Excellence (COE), Nagoya University from 2003 to 2004 working with professors K. Kakehi & F. Itakura. Fujimura then served as fellow at the International Institute for Advanced Studies, Kyoto, Japan from April 2004 to August 2006. Fujimura believed strongly diversity and inclusion in science. Through mentorship and encouragement Fujimura aided a younger generation of speech scientists. He encouraged the young generation to ‚ÄúPay it Forward‚Äù with their own junior researchers, creating a perpetual positive cycle.  Patents  As a basic researcher pioneering work on speech synthesis, Fujimura did not frequently patent his inventions. Fujimura did patent his Speech transmission system from 1978, US 4170719 A. This machine created speech synthesis with voiced and unvoiced sounds produced differently. One of his creations was the computer-tracking-based X-Ray microbeam system for recording human utterances. The first version of the machine was at University of Tokyo, built by JEOL (Nihon-Denshi KK). The second version was built at University of Wisconsin and was in use until 2009. They used extremely low doses of X-ray to track the movement of the tongue and oral chamber in order to study how humans uttered sounds. Both machines were used by generations of researchers to discover and to verify theories of human speech generation. US Patent 4426722 A covers the electron source for the X Ray machine.  Personal life  Osamu Fujimura was born August 29, 1927. The Fujimura family is descended from the Miyamoto clan (Ê∫êÊ∞è), remotely related to the samurai Minamoto Yoritomo (Ê∫êÈ†ºÊúù), who founded the Kamakura Bakufu (military government site) as a Sh≈çgun (Â∞ÜËªç) in the 12th century. Yoritomo's grave is behind the Hachimangu ÂÖ´Âπ°ÂÆÆ in Yukinoshita, Kamakura. He was survived by his second wife J.C. Williams, and four sons, Akira, Makoto, Wataru, and Itaru.

In his career he received the nickname \\"The Big Noise\\" for the 2000 or so sound effects he could create with his voice. Early life Gaetano Mazzaglia dei Conti Cutelli was born in Sicily, and grew up on his father's estate near Mount Etna. He was raised as a nobleman within the Italian aristocracy. One of his first jobs was as a sea captain and during the First World War he fought for the Italian Army on the African front. Stage and screen career Cutelli started his career as a stage actor, performing in European vaudeville venues‚Äîspecifically in Palermo. He moved to Hollywood in the early 1920s in order to begin performing in early \\"talkie\\" motion pictures. His first contact in the film world was with the manager of Gloria Swanson, who had heard Cutelli's impressions during his early radio work. He was asked to do a screen test for his imitation of a crying baby, and soon after began doing film work. From there, he became a pioneer in the creation of sound effects in both film and radio. By 1929, his career in the movies was the subject of an article by The New York Times. He immigrated to the United States in 1930, settling in Los Angeles, and became a naturalized citizen a decade later. Cutelli was able to produce more than 2,000 sound effects from his throat, including a large variety of different animals, mechanical noises (like air plane squadrons), and weather effects (like howling winds or sea waves crashing on the shore). From these skills, he earned the nickname \\"The Big Noise\\", and began to invent various mechanical devices for the replication of similar sounds for radio and film. In many cases he would personally install the devices, which were used in both the US and many European countries. He also worked closely with Leon Schlesinger to hold seminars on the subject matter. For example, in 1935 he developed and installed the noise machines for WGN in Chicago. These devices were generally much smaller and cheaper than those used previously. He also developed techniques for the creation of other noises, such as rain, used in the media industry. During his work, Cutelli acted as the supervisor of sound effects for several early Hollywood studios. =Roles= Films that his voice work was feature in included The Trespasser, The Love Parade, and Condemned, and he voiced the crying baby Abraham Lincoln in the 1930 film Abraham Lincoln. Death Cutelli died of a heart attack on July 16, 1944, while waiting for a train in Seattle. Upon his death, the Chicago Tribune called him the \\"Genius of Sound Effects\\". After his death, The Berlin Anthropological Institute offered $2,000 to purchase Cutelli's head so that it could be studied for his sound effects ability. The request was declined by the family. Anniversary Celebrating Mickey Mouse's 90th birthday year in 2018, the newspaper il Mattino published a story of remembrance.

The advantage of using phosphates in a consumer laundry detergent or dishwashing detergent is that they make detergents more efficient by chelating calcium and magnesium ions. The disadvantage of using phosphates is that they remain in wastewater and eventually make their way to a natural body of water. While phosphates are low toxicity, they instead cause nutrient pollution and feed the algae. This leads to eutrophication and harmful algal bloom. Many countries have banned the use of phosphates in detergent, including the European Union and the United States. Independent product testing noted that manufacturers reformulated their products after bans. Those reports indicated that the new products without phosphates were satisfactory. Regulation In 1977 the United States Environmental Protection Agency published a position paper advocating for a phosphate ban in detergents States including Maine, Florida, and Indiana in the United States began restricting or banning the use of phosphates in laundry detergent in the early 1970s, culminating in a nationwide voluntary ban in 1994. In July 2010, 17 states followed up with bans on its use in automatic dishwasher detergent. In 2004, the European Union introduced regulations to require biodegradability in all detergents. In 2011 the European Commission announced that the European Parliament had ordered a ban of phosphates in consumer laundry detergent by June 2013 and a ban in dishwasher detergent by January 2017. Australia began phasing out the use of phosphates in its detergents in 2011, with an all-out ban expected to take effect in 2014. Canada banned some phosphates in detergent in 2011. Italy started phasing out phosphates in the 1980s. Pursuant to findings published in 2006 by the Shenkar College of Engineering and Design indicating that liquid detergents are \\"much more environment-friendly\\" than powdered detergents, Israel's Ministry of the Environment began recommending that consumers prefer liquid detergent over powdered ones \\"for laundry which is not heavily stained.\\" Banning discussion in the United States started because of pollution of the Great Lakes. Seventeen US states have partial or full bans on the use of phosphates in dish detergent, and two US states (Maryland and New York) ban phosphates in commercial dishwashing. In 1983 there was a corruption scandal in which industry sought to influence government regulators regarding the ban. Some dishwashing detergents may contain phosphorus, an ingredient which at least two states in the United States have limited use in dishwashing detergent. Environmental impact Phosphates have low toxicity in the environment but causes nutrient pollution, a major water quality problem in many watersheds. Phosphates in water cause eutrophication of algae which creates conditions favorable to formation of harmful algal blooms. These blooms prevent light and oxygen from getting into the water, leading to the death of organisms in the ecosystem. Studies have revisited the question of whether existing household phosphate bans are effective in reducing phosphorus concentration in waterways, and subsequent algal blooms. A 2014 case study of Vermont phosphate policies around Lake Champlain showed that while the bans reduced the phosphate contribution by treated wastewater from households to five percent of the total contribution, phosphate levels did not decline and in fact increased slightly, due primarily to increased contributions of similar magnitudes from stormwater runoff and agricultural sources; as a result, algal blooms have continued to worsen. Most dishwasher detergent contains complex phosphates, as they have several properties that aid in effective cleaning. However, the same chemicals have been removed from laundry detergents in many countries as a result of concerns raised about the increase in algal blooms in waterways caused by increasing phosphate levels (see eutrophication). Phosphorus that runs into freshwater lakes and rivers can cause algal blooms. Phosphate-free detergent reduces the amount of phosphate wastewater treatment plants must clean up. From the 1960s-2010s the standard way to determine the amount of phosphate in water is using colorimetry. It is possible to use optical sensors for measurements, which could be easier and cheaper, but this is not a common practice. Uses Sodium tripolyphosphate was an excellent builder used in laundry detergent powders. However, due to issues of biodegradability many countries have banned the use of phosphates in detergents. Manufacturers are using substitutes such as EDTA and other biodegradable chemicals instead. Phosphates bind calcium and magnesium ions to prevent 'hard-water' type limescale deposits. They can cause ecological damage, so their use is starting to be phased out. Phosphate-free detergents are sold as eco-friendly detergents. In the 21st century phosphates began to be reduced in percentage terms as an ingredient, leading to a New York Times report that said \\"low- or phosphate-free dishwasher detergents it tested, including those from environmentally friendly product lines that have been on the market for years, none matched the performance of products with phosphates\\". Society and culture =History of discussion= There was a conflict between industry which wanted to continue to use phosphates and advocates who wanted to preserve water quality. In the 1960s scientists recognized that phosphates in water caused eutrophication. There was disagreement at that time about whether water with high phosphate came to have the chemical because of somehow being polluted with it. By the 1970s it was established that high phosphate levels in water were a consequence of pollution. Discussion began about how to respond to the effects of phosphates as a pollutant in both fresh and marine water. =Marketing= Detergent companies claimed it is not cost effective to make separate batches of detergent for the states with phosphate bans (although detergents are typically formulated for local markets), and so most have voluntarily removed phosphates from all dishwasher detergents. According to the Washington Post, phosphorus keeps \\"minerals from interfering with the cleaning process and prevent food particles from depositing again on dishes.\\" According to Time magazine, \\"One reason detergent makers have been using large amounts of phosphorus is that it binds with dirt and keeps it suspended in water, allowing the other cleaning agents to do their best work. Phosphorus is especially important in regions with hard water because the presence of lots of minerals can interfere with cleaning agents.\\" =Marketplace response= Consumer Reports product testing found that new detergent formulations without phosphates did not wash dishes as well but were satisfactory replacement products. Similarly, testing found that phosphate bans in laundry detergent led to newer products which did not clean clothes as well but still could compete with the older products containing phosphate. A 1973 paper in psychology predicted a consumer response from the perspective of removing a behavioral freedom.

Kierner and Sandra Gioia Treadway, Virginia Women: Their Lives and Times, vol 2 (University of Georgia Press 2016) pp. 333 et seq. Early and family life Born in Chicago, Illinois, where her father John Andrew Rice was teaching and studying at the University of Chicago, Marion Aydelotte Rice moved with her family to Nebraska, England and finally North Carolina, where her father helped found Black Mountain College in 1933. Mary Rice attended Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, where her mother's brother Frank Aydelotte was president, and graduated with highest honors. She met Roger Dureya Marshall when they were both working for the Alien Property Custodian Office in Washington, D.C. during World War II. They married in 1944 and had three daughters who survived them. Career After moving to Washington D.C. in 1942, Marshall worked as an economist for the U.S. Department of Justice until 1946.Washington Post obituary She and her husband settled in Arlington, Virginia in 1953. As a housewife, Mrs. Marshall became politically active in the League of Women Voters, then the local Democratic Party (which she found conservative but not in lockstep with the Byrd Organization). Marshall consistently opposed the Byrd Organization's Massive Resistance against the Supreme Court's school desegregation decisions in Brown v. Board of Education, and later commented that she was initially one of 17 \\"liberals\\" out of 70 local Democratic Committee members. Arlington voluntarily desegregated in February 1959 after Governor J. Lindsay Almond, Jr. broke with the Byrd Organization and acceded to decisions by a three-judge federal panel and the Virginia Supreme Court issued on January 19, 1959. Marshall and a fellow desegregation advocate entertained frightened parents on the day that Stratford Junior High School quietly desegregated.remarks by Theda Henle Arlington's Democrats elected Marshall as their chairman in 1961 (she won by 2 votes). One of her first acts was to eliminate the Committee's reliance on closed executive sessions, as well as the prior practice of siding with Republicans (led by U.S. Congressman Joel Broyhill) in order to defeat \\"Arlingtonians for A Better County\\" (ABC) candidates for County offices. This arose in part because the ABC opposed closing schools to prevent their desegregation (part of Massive Resistance, which Broyhill's opponent and ABC co-founder Edmund D. Campbell had fought) and generally progressive positions. Marshall also created a data base (at first manual lists) of Democratic voters and support throughout the County, made sure that voters who paid the $1 poll tax in May also actually registered to vote in the fall elections, and established \\"New Frontier\\" clubs throughout the county which met monthly to discuss various issues of the day and attracted potential voters.Washington Post March 19, 1961Arlington Democratic Committee obituary To preserve party unity, Marshall ensured that both Arlington's Democratic state senator, Charles R. Fenwick (who cooperated with the Byrd Organization) and delegate Hank Mann (Fenwick's protege who soon broke with the organization because its apportionment shortchanged northern Virginia) remained on the party's steering committee. Delegate Mann (together with consistently pro-desegregation Arlington delegate Kathryn H. Stone and two other northern Virginia legislators) challenged the Byrd organization's reapportionment following the 1960 census. As a result of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision striking down the previous reapportionment in Davis v. Mann, Arlington received another seat in the General Assembly. However, in 1965 Stone decided against seeking re- election. Marshall defeated Republican Caroline Ogletree and succeeded Stone. She served her first two terms in the Virginia House of Delegates, from 1966 to 1970, alongside veteran Democrat Hank Mann as well as fellow Democrats Wallace G. Dickson and William M. Lightsey in what was then Virginia's 9th District. Mrs. Marshall joined Marion Galland and Dorothy Shoemaker McDiarmid, both also from northern Virginia, in the Virginia General Assembly. House Speaker Blackie Moore, a lieutenant in the Byrd Organization, assigned all four female delegates to the Education Committee. However, Republicans swept aside all the Democratic candidates in 1970, replacing them with George Mason Green, Jr., Allen H. Harrison, Jr., Henry O. Lampe and George P. Shafran. Virginia Democrats experienced a backlash against the sales tax, as well as a speech by President Richard M. Nixon, who urged people to vote Republican in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, but which had broader effects. Courteous Clive L. DuVal II of Fairfax and Byrd Organization stalwart James M. Thompson of Alexandria were the only Democrats elected to the General Assembly from northern Virginia that year. Mrs. Marshall then helped rebuild the local Democratic party, joking that calling herself a \\"mere housewife\\" was the \\"equivalent of calling yourself a 'simple country lawyer' [alluding to North Carolina's Senator Sam Ervin during the Watergate scandal]. It's a non- threatening phrase that may, or may not indicate you know what's going on.\\" After redistricting following the 1970 census, Arlington lost a seat in the House of Delegates, but in 1972 Marshall again won election to the state house (as did Republican Green) and Democrat John L. Melnick won the third seat in what had become the 22nd Virginia house district.Cynthia Miller Leonard, The General Assembly of Virginia 1619‚Äì1978 (Richmond, Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 740, 746, 758, 765, 772 In 1975, Melnick and Marshall and fellow Democrat Warren G. Stambaugh outpolled all the Republican candidates, and Arlington's delegation would remain all-Democrat for years (James F. Almand replacing Melnick in 1977). After the 1980 reapportionment and advent of single-member districts, the district was renumbered the 48th. Marshall continued to win re- election until 1991 (facing no opposition in 1985, 1987 and 1989), when she announced in April that she would not seek re-election, but rather spend more time with her husband and family.http://dela.state.va.us/dela/Membios.nsf/94f6e9b9c9b5678f85256b1b00732227?SearchView She had also served on the executive committees of the National Conference of State Legislatures and the Southern Legislative Conference. Newspapers at the time noted that her retirement, together with Delegate MacDiarmid's two years earlier, Delegate Stambaugh's demise eight months earlier and Delegate Du Val's retirement announced just three weeks before significantly reduced Northern Virginia's seniority and clout in the General Assembly.Washington Post April 24, 1991 pp. D-1, D-5.Arlington Journal April 24, 1991 pp. A-1, A-4 Julia A. Connolly then won the Democratic primary and the general election, and succeeded Marshal. During her initial stint in the General Assembly, Marshall had helped found the Women's Roundtable. The weekly Wednesday morning meeting when the General Assembly was in session created a network of women legislators and organizations interested in women's issues, and in 1986 also successfully blocked attempts to weaken the state's conflict of interest law.Lex Claudia Winter 1997Washington Post Feb. 15, 1986 pp. B-1, B-5 After her re-election in 1972, Marshall rose in seniority and power. She sponsored landmark legislation modernizing state policies concerning the elderly (including equal treatment of widows in inheritance and pension taxes, and rights of nursing home patients), and a variety of issues relating to women and children, mentally retarded persons and libraries. Marshall also sponsored Virginia's first legislation guaranteeing the return of tenants' security deposits and according rights to people displaced by condominium conversions, the first minimum wage law, and the first automobile inspection law. She became chairman of the Cities, Counties and Towns Committee, as well as served on the Privileges and Elections Committee (the first woman to do so, and rising to chair), the Committee on Health Institutions and Welfare, the Roads and Internal Navigation Committee, and Conservation and Natural Resources Committee.\\"Longtime Arlington Del.

The ecoregion extends southwest from the Amazon River between its large Tapaj√≥s and Xingu tributaries. Location The Tapaj√≥s-Xingu moist forests lie between the Tapaj√≥s river to the west and the Xingu rivers to the east, tributaries of the Amazon River to the north. They have an area of . The rivers act as barriers to the movement of plants, animals and insects to and from adjacent regions. In the south the rugged Serra do Cachimbo divides the ecoregion from other moist forest areas. There are urban centers at Santar√©m at the mouth of the Tapaj√≥s, Aveiro on the lower Tapaj√≥s and Altamira on the Iriri River. The ecoregion is crossed by the Trans-Amazonian Highway (BR-230) and the BR-163 highway from Santar√©m to Cuiab√°. To the northwest the ecoregion adjoins the Madeira-Tapaj√≥s moist forests on the other side of the Tapaj√≥s River. To the north it adjoins the Gurupa v√°rzea along the Amazon River. The Uatuma-Trombetas moist forests are on the opposite bank of the Amazon. To the east are the Xingu-Tocantins- Araguaia moist forests. To the south and southwest the ecoregion blends into the Mato Grosso seasonal forests ecoregion. Physical Elevations range from above sea level along the Amazon to in the south. The ecoregion mostly lies on the undulating terrain of the ancient Brazilian Shield. Soils are often rich in nutrients, but poor soils are found in the higher areas. The main rivers are blackwater, with little or no suspended sediment. The largest is the Iriri, a tributary of the Xingu. Others are the Jamanxim, Curu√°, Crepori, Curu√° Una, and Jaraucu. Climate The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Am\\": equatorial, monsoonal. Temperatures are fairly uniform throughout the year, slightly cooler in July and slightly warmer in April. They range from to , with a mean of just under . Annual rainfall is . Monthly rainfall ranges from in July to in February, with rain falling on about 240 days of each year. Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Flora= Jamanxim River from the air The regions with rich soil have diverse flora and fauna with many endemic species. Mostly the forests are evergreen tropical rainforest on terra firme, not subject to flooding. There is lowland forest along the Amazon River. Further south the forest is submontane, open canopy forest with patches of dense forest. Where the blackwater rivers flood they create igap√≥ forests. An unusual form of forest with many large lianas at all levels is found on the higher land in the south and southeast of the ecoregion. Typically these forests are found on richer soils, and have a canopy under , lower than the canopy of the humid terra firme forest. Lianas belong to the families Bignoniaceae, Fabaceae, Hippocrateaceae, Menispermaceae, Sapindaceae and Malpighiaceae. Large trees in the liana forests include Apuleia molaris, Bagassa guianensis, Caryocar villosum, Hymenaea parvifolia, Tetragastris altissima, Astronium graveolens, Astronium lecointei, Apuleia leiocarpa, Sapium marmieri, Acacia polyphylla, Elizabetha species, Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla). Endemic trees and lianas include Cenostigma tocantinum, Ziziphus itacaiunensis and Bauhinia bombaciflora. Common trees in eastern Par√° that are not found to the west of the Tapaj√≥s include Zollernia paraensi, cupua√ßu (Theobroma grandiflorum) and Cordia goeldiana. The predominant white-sand igap√≥ forest along the clearwater Tapaj√≥s holds species of the family Myrtaceae and trees such as Triplaris surinamensis, Piranhea trifoliata, Copaifera martii, Alchornea castaneifolia and Handroanthus heptaphyllus. =Fauna= White-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus) 161 species of mammals have been recorded. The white-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus) occurs only to the east of the Tapaj√≥s. Other mammals are the red-bellied titi (Callicebus moloch), Azara's night monkey (Aotus azarae infulatus), white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), white- lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), cougar (Puma concolor), jaguar (Panthera onca), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), and brocket deer (Mazama genus). The rivers are home to spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), black caiman (Melanosuchus niger), yellow-spotted river turtle (Podocnemis unifilis), Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) and tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis). Endangered mammals include the white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), white-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). 556 species of birds have been recorded. These include osprey (Pandion haliaetus), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja), channel- billed toucan (Ramphastos vitellinus), little chachalaca (Ortalis motmot), nine tinamou species (genera Crypturellus and Tinamus), seven macaw species (genus Ara) including hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), many parakeets (genera Aratinga, Pyrrhura and Brotogeris), parrots (genera Amazona and Pionus) and the hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin). Endangered birds include the green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster) and red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus). Status The World Wildlife Fund classes the ecoregion as \\"Vulnerable\\". The Tapaj√≥s-Xingu, Xingu-Tocantins-Araguaia and Tocantins-Pindara moist forest ecoregions on the eastern edge of the Amazon basin have all been badly affected by human settlement and deforestation. Roads have opened the region to rapid and uncontrolled growth of colonies, logging, ranching and major projects that have destroyed large areas of forest and degraded the land. The remaining forests are threatened by large and uncontrolled man-made fires. Miners seeking gold and other mineral pollute the rivers with chemicals. During the period from 2004 to 2011 the ecoregion experienced an annual rate of habitat loss of 0.38%. Global warming will force tropical species to migrate uphill to find areas with suitable temperature and rainfall. Low, flat, deforested ecoregions such as the Tapaj√≥s-Xingu moist forests are extremely vulnerable. The Amaz√¥nia National Park protects both sides of the Tapaj√≥s near Itaituba, with an area of , but it is underfunded. The Tapaj√≥s National Forest does little to protect the forests near Aveiro.

The term \\"Russian Laundromat\\" was coined by the OCCRP. The analyzed documents contained the details of approximately 70,000 banking transactions, according to Bloomberg, with 1,920 firms in the UK and 373 in the US involved.Laundered Russian Cash Went Through Big Banks, Guardian Says in Bloomberg The alleged architect of the scheme is Veaceslav Platon, a Moldovan businessman and former MP. Igor Putin (Vladimir Putin's cousin) has also been named in connection with this scheme. The scheme allowed Russia's elite to funnel out at least $20 billion from Russia. Laundered Money by Region =Global banks and other= The $20.8 billion was laundered in 96 countries, according to the investigation. According to money laundering experts, the money was moved initially to a network of 21 shell companies in the UK, Cyprus, and New Zealand, after which further payments went to wider group of companies, many of which were fictitious. Eleven companies registered in the UAE were named in the investigation as possible shell companies filtering the laundered money, and the data said that the UAE registered companies total received $434,076,385.\\"UAE named in $20bn Russian money laundering scheme \\" in Arabian Business by Sarah Townsend on 21 March 2017 Global banks that touched the laundered money included Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, and Barclays. =British territories= Afterwards, it was reported that $740 million had been processed by British banks as part of the scheme. On 20 March 2017 the British paper The Guardian reported that hundreds of banks had helped launder KGB-related funds out of Russia, as uncovered by the investigation named Global Laundromat. Among the banks facing scrutiny under the investigation were HSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest, Lloyds, Barclays and Coutts. HSBC was listed among the 17 banks in the UK that were \\"facing questions over what they knew about the international scheme and why they did not turn away suspicious money transfers\\", as HSBC \\"processed $545.3m in Laundromat cash, mostly routed through its Hong Kong branch\\". The Royal Bank of Scotland \\"handled $113.1 million\\" in Laundromat cash. Coutts, owned by RBS, had \\"accepted $32.8m worth of payments via its office in Zurich, Switzerland.‚Äù NatWest, also owned by RBS, was named for allowing through $1.1 million in related funds. The Guardian reported that around 500 people were suspected of being involved, many of whom were wealthy Russians. On 27 March 2017, The Herald in Scotland reported that Scottish shell companies were used as part of the scheme, estimated at $5 billion. The newspaper said that one means to circumvent capital export controls was for a Western company to make a fake loan to a Russian company. The Russian company would intentionally default on the loan, and a corrupt court in Moldova would order the company to pay the \\"debt\\". The Guardian wrote that most of the companies involved in laundering the money had UK registration and over half of the money went to shell companies in Scotland, Birmingham, and London. Of those core companies, the data read that Seabon Lt. handled $9 billion through a network of companies. Involved parties included Chadborg Trade LLP, a British shell company, and Tronlux Ventures LLP, also a British shell company. By June 2017 the UK watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, had demanded information from HSBC and the Royal Bank of Scotland concerning the Russian Laundromat. =United States= Citibank was listed among the American banks who were named as having handled the laundered funds, with banks in the US processing around $63.7 million between 2010 and 2014.

Description of the algorithm The Samuelson‚ÄìBerkowitz algorithm applied to a matrix A produces a vector whose entries are the coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of A. It computes this coefficients vector recursively as the product of a Toeplitz matrix and the coefficients vector an (n-1)\\\\times(n-1) principal submatrix.

The algorithm is then applied recursively to A_1, producing the Toeplitz matrix T_1 times the characteristic polynomial of A_2, etc. Finally, the characteristic polynomial of the 1\\\\times 1 matrix A_{n-1} is simply T_{n-1}.

C. and P. K. Trivedi (2005): Microeconometrics: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press, New York. When dealing with duration data (such as employment spells or mortality outcomes), the data sampling method has a direct impact on subsequent analyses and inference. An example in demography would be sampling the number of people who die within a given time frame (e.g. a specific calendar year); a popular example in economics would be the number of people leaving unemployment within a given time frame (e.g. a specific quarter).Salant, S. (1977): Search Theory and Duration Data: A Theory of Sorts. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 91(1), pp. 39‚Äì57. Researchers imposing similar assumptions but using different sampling methods, can reach fundamentally different conclusions if the joint distribution across the flow and stock samples differ.Chesher, A. and T. Lancaster (1981): Stock and Flow Sampling. Economics Letters 8(1), pp. 63‚Äì65. Typically, flow samples suffer from right censoring. After a certain amount of time, as the sampling interval ends, the individuals in the sample are not followed any longer, outcomes are recorded and the data is analyzed. In the unemployment example outlined above, we observe the exact duration for individuals leaving unemployment within the time frame. For people that haven't left unemployment yet, we only observe the lower bound of the unemployment spell.Wooldridge, J. (2002): Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. The difference between stock and flow sampling can also help explain why certain statistics that measure similar duration measures can differ in important ways. Consider, for instance, the Average Interrupted Duration (AID), the average period for which people that are currently unemployed have been unemployed, and ACD, the average duration of the complete unemployment spell for employed people. Salant shows that heterogeneity in hazard rates between the stock and the flow distribution provides a key to understanding why these two statistics differ. For instance, if the probability of getting a job offer goes down with time unemployed, E[T] < E[S], where S and T stand for observed and actual duration respectively. Renewal theory is the appropriate tool for handling these issues, and a wide range of estimators have been proposed. These estimators range from fully parametric models such as the Mixed Proportional Hazard model,Lancaster, T. (1979): Econometric Methods for the Duration of Unemployment. Econometrica 47(4), pp. 939‚Äì956. to nonparametric and semiparametric methods.Hausman, J. A. and T. Woutersen (2014), Estimating a semi-parametric duration model without specifying heterogeneity.

History  It was constructed by H.H. The Maharaja Holkar of Indore State (of the Marathas), as a retreat and used by him and his family to enjoy their holidays and picnics in pre-independent British India. The palace was built in European style. The Hindi/Punjabi language word \\"Kothi\\" means a luxurious home or mansion built by the wealthy higher or royal class. After independence of India from Britain, this mansion was taken over by the state government of Madhya Pradesh. The main floor was converted into the offices of Narmada River Valley Development Project which planned to use the waters of the River Narmada for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation through construction of dams and canals. The top floor was divided equally into the residential quarters of the superintendent engineer and chief engineer of the project. In its heyday, the palace had beautiful gardens around it with a fountain and had office staff, servants, gardeners and drivers working in its compound. Today it continues to house the state government offices of the Narmada (River) Valley Development Authority, Circle Number 8. The Narmada Kothi was originally painted yellow with white highlights and now it is painted in a light maroon colour with white highlights but its interior still remains predominantly yellow with white highlights. Location It is constructed on a fortified embankment just above the high flood level mark on the banks of the Narmada River in Barwaha, in the modern day state of Madhya Pradesh. It is situated just east of the Khandwa - Indore Road Bridge over the Narmada River on the National Highway 27.

These include the Bur Press, the Anvil Press, and the King Library Press. She, along with her husband Victor Hammer, was an influential figure in modern fine printing in the United States. Early life and education A native of Paris, Kentucky, Hammer earned her undergraduate degree from Transylvania University and her graduate degree in library science from the Columbia University (1933). She worked at the Library of Congress (1933‚Äì1936), at the Stuart Robinson School in Blackey, Kentucky (1936‚Äì1940), and the University of Kentucky until her retirement in 1976. She worked with Margaret I. King, the University of Kentucky's first librarian, becoming the Head of Acquisitions and later the Curator of Rare Books.  Presses  Inspired by her class on rare books at Columbia, Hammer and Amelia Buckley started the Bur Press in 1943. They printed a series of books called Kentucky Monographs as well as calendars with photographs by the Lexington Camera Club. The first book printed in Kentucky Monographs was by UK Dean of Women Margaret Newnan Wagers entitled Education of a Gentleman: Jefferson Davis at Transylvania. The members of the Bur Press included Hammer and Buckley as printers, Harriet McDonald Holladay as artist, and Mary Spears Van Meter as hand book-binder. The first printshop was in Buckley's Dudley Road basement; the second and last in a room added on to Bullock Place, Hammer's home. The Anvil Press, an association of multiple printers, was founded in 1953. Members included Victor Hammer, Carolyn Reading, Dr. W. O. Bullock, Virginia Clark, Clavia Goodman, Lucy and Joseph Graves, Harriett McDonald, R. Hunter Middleton, Maria Bizzoni, Gordon Bechanan, Caroline Porter, Nancy Chambers, and Martha Livesay. Publications of the press include Oration on the Dignity of Man by Pico della Mirandola, The Booke of the Duchesse by Chaucer, and William Tyndale's The Four Gospels. After 1978, Carolyn Reading Hammer used the moniker of Anvil Press exclusively for her own printing after buying out the other press members. Carolyn Reading Hammer founded the King Library Press in 1956 in the basement of the Margaret I. King Library. It was originally called the High Noon Press, because it was operated by librarians on their lunch hour. The first work produced was The Marriage of Cock Robin and Jenny Wren. Hammer served as the director of the King Library Press until her retirement in 1976.  Personal life  Carolyn Reading Hammer married Victor Hammer, an Austrian-born American printer and typographer (1882‚Äì1967), in 1955. She studied hand printing under Victor Hammer starting in 1949, when he served as artist in residence at Transylvania University. The couple was friends with spiritualist Thomas Merton, exchanging a lengthy correspondence.

She was ordered from the Austro-Hungarian shipyard Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino, was laid down in May 1868, and was completed in February 1871. The design for Iclaliye was based on the earlier s built in France, though she carried a slightly more powerful armament consisting of two Armstrong guns and three Armstrong guns. During the Russo-Turkish War she supported Ottoman forces fighting in the Caucasus. She spent most of the rest her career out of service, as the Ottoman Navy was allowed to languish. In 1912, the Navy activated the ancient Iclaliye to help provide artillery support to the forces defending Constantinople. She served in subsidiary roles, including as a training ship and a barracks ship, until 1928 when she was decommissioned and broken up. Design In the early 1860s, the Eyalet of Egypt, a province of the Ottoman Empire, ordered a series of ironclad warships from foreign shipyards. Iclaliye was the last vessel to be ordered by the Egyptian government. The contract was awarded to the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste, then part of the Austro- Hungarian Empire in 1868. By this time, Egyptian efforts to assert their independence had angered Sultan Abd√ºlaziz, who on 5 June 1867 demanded Egypt surrender all of the ironclads ordered from foreign shipyards. After lengthy negotiations, Egypt surrendered Iclaliye and the other Egyptian ironclads in exchange for the central government recognizing greater autonomy, transforming the Eyalet into the Khedivate of Egypt. Iclaliye was a slightly enlarged version of the earlier s that had been built in France, carrying a slightly more powerful armament. =Characteristics= Iclaliye was long between perpendiculars and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . Her hulls was constructed with iron, and displaced normally and BOM. She had a crew of 16 officers and 132 enlisted men as completed, and her enlisted crew increased to 180 by 1891. The ship was powered by a single horizontal compound engine which drove one screw propeller. Steam was provided by two coal-fired box boilers manufactured by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino, which were trunked into a single funnel amidships. The engine was rated at and produced a top speed of on sea trials, though by 1877 she was only capable of . Decades of poor maintenance had reduced both ships' speed to by 1896. Iclaliye carried of coal. A supplementary sailing rig with two masts was also fitted. Iclaliye was armed with a battery of two muzzle-loading Armstrong guns and three Armstrong guns. The 228 mm guns and two of the 178 mm guns were mounted in a central, armored casemate, one gun of each caliber per side. The third 178 mm gun was placed atop the casemate in a revolving barbette mount. In 1885, these guns were replaced by a 22-caliber Krupp gun in the barbette mount and a pair of Krupp guns in the casemate. A secondary battery of light guns was also added, which included two Krupp breech-loading guns, two Krupp breech-loaders, two Hotchkiss revolver cannon, and two Nordenfelt guns. By 1905, the 150 mm gun and the 63.7 mm weapons were removed. The ship was protected with wrought iron armor plate. She had a complete armored belt at the waterline, which extended above the waterline and below. The portion above water was thick, while the portion below was thick. The casemate battery was protected with 114 mm of iron, with transverse bulkheads on either end. Her barbette mounting was protected by of iron. Service history Iclaliye, meaning \\"Glorious\\", had had her keel laid in May 1868; she was formally transferred to the Ottoman Empire on 29 August 1868, and she was launched the following year. On 25 January 1871, Iclaliye began sea trials, and she was ready to be commissioned the following month. Early in the ship's career, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was activated every summer for short cruises from the Golden Horn to the Bosporus to ensure their propulsion systems were in operable condition. =Russo-Turkish War= The Ottoman fleet began mobilizing in September 1876 to prepare for a conflict with Russia, as tensions with the country had been growing for several years, an insurrection had begun in Ottoman Bosnia in mid-1875, and Serbia had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in July 1876. At the start of 1877, the ship was assigned to the 2. Division of the Mediterranean Fleet, based in Crete, along with the ironclads and . The Russo- Turkish War began on 24 April 1877 with a Russian declaration of war, after which Iclaliye was transferred to the Black Sea Division, where she spent the war with the bulk of the Ottoman ironclad fleet. The Ottoman fleet, commanded by Hobart Pasha, was vastly superior to the Russian Black Sea Fleet; the only ironclads the Russians possessed there were and , circular vessels that had proved to be useless in service. The presence of the fleet did force the Russians to keep two corps in reserve for coastal defense, but the Ottoman high command failed to make use of its naval superiority in a more meaningful way, particularly to hinder the Russian advance into the Balkans. Hobart Pasha took the fleet to the eastern Black Sea, where he was able to make a more aggressive use of it to support the Ottoman forces battling the Russians in the Caucasus. The fleet bombarded Poti and assisted in the defense of Batumi. On 14 May 1877, an Ottoman squadron consisting of Iclaliye and the ironclads , , , , and bombarded Russian positions around the Black Sea port of Sokhumi before landing infantry and arming the local populace to start an uprising against the Russians. The Ottomans captured Sokhumi two days later. Over the course of the war, Russian torpedo boats made several attacks on the vessels stationed in the Black Sea, but Iclaliye was not damaged in any of them. These attacks included one launched on 10 June by six torpedo boats, by which point Iclaliye had been transferred to the port of Sulina at the mouth of the Danube, along with Feth-i B√ºlend and Mukaddeme-i Hayir. During this attack, the boat targeted Iclaliye, but defensive nets set up around the vessel prevented the torpedo from exploding against her hull. Iclaliye got underway, but was not fast enough to catch the Russian torpedo boats, though one of them was sunk by the explosion of its own torpedo. After the end of the war, Iclaliye was laid up in Constantinople in 1879. =Later career= The annual summer cruises to the Bosporus ended after the Russo-Turkish War. By the early-1880s, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was in poor condition, and Iclaliye was unable to go to sea. Many of the ships' engines were unusable, having seized up from rust, and their hulls were badly fouled. The British naval attache to the Ottoman Empire at the time estimated that the Imperial Arsenal would take six months to get just five of the ironclads ready to go to sea. Throughout this period, the ship's crew was limited to about one-third the normal figure. In 1883, Iclaliye was sent to Crete to guard the island. She remained there for three years before returning to the Golden Horn in January 1886. The ship was refitted by the Imperial Arsenal in 1891. At the start of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, the Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including Iclaliye, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy, which possessed the three modern s. The ships' guns and armor were long obsolete, and their crews were poorly trained. Through April and May, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. The condition of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers, particularly the British Admiral Henry Woods and the German Admiral Eugen Kalau vom Hofe, who led the inspection. The fleet proved to be an embarrassment for the government and finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau-Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed the ships, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and the inability of the Ottoman government to pay for the work. By 1900, the contracts were finally awarded, but Iclaliye was not included in the program. In 1904, the ship's barbette was removed and she was placed in the reserve fleet later that year. During the Italo-Turkish War, Iclaliye was stationed in the Golden Horn. On 30 October 1912, during the First Balkan War, Iclaliye was reactivated to stop the Bulgarian advance against the Ottoman defenders at √áatalca. She was joined by the ironclad Necm-i ≈ûevket; both vessels had to be towed into place, and they remained in their firing positions for only a few days. The two ships, joined by the pre-dreadnought battleships and and the modernized ironclads and , were towed to B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece, where they remained from 15 to 20 November, though they made little contact with Bulgarian forces. From February 1914, the ship served as an accommodation hulk for the Naval High School at Heybeliada. She became a stationary training ship for naval cadets in February 1919, based in Constantinople. She returned to barracks ship duties in 1923 and was stationed at the G√∂lc√ºk Naval Shipyard. She was decommissioned in 1928 and broken up in G√∂lc√ºk.

Wastewater flow is generated when appropriate water supply is available within the buildings or close to them. Decentralized wastewater systems treat, reuse or dispose the effluent in relatively close vicinity to its source of generation. They have the purpose to protect public health and the natural environment by reducing substantially health and environmental hazards. They are also referred as \\"decentralized wastewater treatment systems\\" because the main technical challenge is the adequate choice of a treatment and/or disposal facility. A commonly used acronym for decentralized wastewater treatment system, is DEWATS.  Background  = Comparison to centralized systems = Centralized wastewater systems are the most widely applied in well-developed urban environments and the oldest approach to the solution of the problems associated with wastewater.Karman D. (2007) The 'Cloaka Maxima' and the monumental manipulation of water in archaic Rome, On-line journal The Water of Rome, retrieved on the 18 March 2017 They collect wastewater in large and bulk pipeline networks, also referred as sewerage, which transport it at long distances to one or several treatment plants. Storm water can be collected in either combined sewers or in a separate storm water drains. The latter consists of two separate pipeline systems, one for the wastewater and one for the storm water. The treated effluent is disposed in different ways, most often discharged into natural water bodies. The treated effluent may also be used for beneficial purposes and in this case it is referred as reclaimed water. The main difference between decentralized and centralized systems is in the conveyance structure. In decentralized systems the treatment and disposal or reuse of the effluent is close to the source of generation. This results in a small conveyance network, in some cases limited only to one pipeline. The size of the network allows for applications of different conveyance methods, in addition to the well-known gravity sewers, such as pressurized sewers and vacuum sewers. The quantity of the effluent is low and is characterized by significant fluctuations. = Applications = In locations with developed infrastructure, decentralized wastewater systems could be a viable alternative of the conventional centralized system, especially in cases of upgrading or retrofitting existing systems. Many different combinations and variations of hybrid systems are possible. The development of new treatment technologies allows for decentralized solutions, which are technically and aesthetically sound and acceptable. Decentralized applications are a necessity in cases of new urban developments, where the construction of the infrastructure is not ready or will be executed in future. In many countries and locations, the infrastructure development (roads, water supply and especially wastewater/drainage systems) is executed years after the housing development. In such cases decentralized wastewater facilities are considered as a temporary solution, but they are mandatory, in order to prevent public health and ecological problems. Decentralized systems allow for flow separation or source separation, which segregates different types of wastewater, based on their origin, such as: black water, greywater and urine.Tchobanoglous G., Leverenz H. (2013) The rationale for decentralization of wastewater infrastructure, in: Source separation and decentralization for wastewater management, ed: Larsen T.A., Udert K.M., Lienert J., IWA publishing, London, UK This approach requires separate parallel pipeline/plumbing systems to convey the segregated flows and the purpose is to apply different level of treatment and handling of each flow and to enhance the safe reuse and disposal of the end products.WHO (2006). WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Grey water . World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland In the specific case of developing countries, where localities with poor infrastructure are common, decentralized wastewater treatment has been promoted extensively because of the possibility to apply technologies with low operation and maintenance requirements.Sasse, L. (1998). DEWATS Decentralised Wastewater Treatment in Developing Countries. Bremen Overseas Research and Development Association (BORDA), Germany In addition, decentralized approaches require smaller scale investments, compared to centralized solutions.  Types  Decentralized wastewater system in Torvetua eco-village in Norway. Wastewater is collected by a vacuum sewer. Greywater is treated locally. Based on the size of the served area, different scales of decentralization could be found: * Decentralization at the level of a suburb or satellite township in an urban area ‚Äì these systems could be defined as small centralized systems when applied to small towns or rural communities. But if they are applied only to selected suburbs or districts in medium or large population centres, with existing centralized system, the whole system could be defined as a hybrid system, where decentralization is applied to parts of the whole drained area. * Decentralization at the level of a neighbourhood ‚Äì this category includes clusters of homes, gated communities, small districts and areas, which are served by vacuum sewers. * Decentralization at ‚Äúon-site‚Äù level (on-site sanitation) ‚Äì in these cases the whole system lays within one property and serves one or several buildings.  Wastewater treatment options  Biogas digester for decentralized wastewater treatment at Meru Prison, Kenya Treatment/disposal facilities requiring effluent infiltration: usually they are applied at on-site level and are adequate because of the very low wastewater quantity generated. However, they require suitable soil conditions, permitting infiltration of the excess water, and low ground water table. If not applied properly, they may be a serious source of ground water pollution.Onsite wastewater treatment systems manual (2002), EPA 625/R-00/008, Washington DC, USA * Pit latrines are applied when the water supply is very scarce and wastewater flow can hardly be generated. They are the most common sanitation technique in under-developed areas. * Septic tanks are the most common on-site treatment technology used, which can be applied successfully where an adequate water supply is available and the soil/groundwater conditions are acceptable. Treatment facilities resembling natural purification processes: their application requires significant surface area, because of the slow pace of the biological processes applied. For the same reason they are more suitable for warmer climates, because the rate of the purification process is temperature dependent. These technologies are more resilient to fluctuating loads and do not require complex maintenance and operation.Scholzel & Bowel (1999) Small scale treatment plant project ‚Äì report on project criteria, guidelines and technologies, SOPAC TR288, retrieved on the 18 March 2017 Constructed wetlands are more suitable for applications at on-site or at neighbourhood level, while stabilization ponds could be a viable alternative for decentralized systems at the level of small towns or rural communities. Engineered wastewater treatment technologies: there is a large variety of wastewater treatment plants where different treatment processes and technologies are applied.Wastewater engineering : treatment and reuse (4th ed.). Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., McGraw Hill, USA. 2003. . Small-scale treatment facilities in decentralized systems, apply similar technologies as medium or large plants.Crites R., Tchobanoglous G. (1998) Small and decentralized wastewater management, WCB/McGraw-Hill, For on-site applications package plants are developed, which are compact and have different compartments for the different processes. However, the design and operation of small treatment plants, especially at neighbourhood or on-site level, present significant challenges to wastewater engineers, related to flow fluctuations, necessity of competent and specialized operation and maintenance, required to deal with a large number of small plants, and relatively high per capita cost.Boller. M. (1997) Small wastewater plants- a challenge to wastewater engineers, Water Science and Technology, Vol 35, issue 6, p.1-12  Regulations and management  Water pollution regulations in the form of legislation documents, guidelines or ordinances prescribe the necessary level of treatment, so that the treated effluent meets the requirements for safe disposal or reuse. Effluent may be disposed by discharging into a natural water body or infiltrated in the ground. In addition, regulations mention requirements regarding the design and operation of wastewater systems, as well as the penalties and other measures for their enforcement. Centralized systems are designed, built and operated in order to fulfil the existing regulations. Their management usually is executed by local authorities. In hybrid systems and small centralized systems in towns or rural communities management can be executed in the same way. In the case of decentralization at on-site level and clusters of buildings, the whole wastewater system is located within private premises. The costs and responsibility for the design, construction, operation and maintenance is the responsibility of the owner. In many cases specialized companies might execute the operation and maintenance procedures. The local authorities issue permits and may provide support for the operation and management in the form of collecting wastes, issuing certificates/licenses for standardized treatment equipment, or for selected qualified private companies. From regulatory point of view, the control of the quality of treated effluent for reuse, discharge or disposal is entirely the responsibility of local or national government authorities. This might be a challenge if a large number of systems must be controlled and inspected. It is in the owner's interest to operate and maintain the system properly, especially in the case of reuse of the treated effluent. Most often the operational problems are associated with clogging of the treatment facilities as result of irregular removal of the sludge or hydraulic overloading due to increased number of population served or increased water consumption.  Urban planning and infrastructure issues  Wastewater systems are part of the infrastructure of urban or rural communities and the urban planning process. Urban planning data and information, such as plots of individual dwellings, roads/streets, stormwater drainage, water supply, and electricity systems are essential for the design and implementation of a sustainable wastewater system. In decentralized wastewater systems, which collect and treat wastewater only, stormwater might be overlooked and cause flooding problems. If planned decentralized solutions are applied, stormwater drainage should be executed together with the roads system. In under-developed population centres where no infrastructure is available, is difficult to provide sustainable sanitation measures; e.g. pit latrines/septic tanks need periodic cleansing, usually executed by vacuum tracks, which have to access the latrine and need a basic road for this purpose. Fecal sludge management deals with the organization and implementation of this practice in a sustainable way, including collection, transport, treatment and disposal/reuse of faecal sludge from pit latrines and septic tanks.WSTF (2015). Design and Technologies of Decentralised Treatment Facilities - Manuals and further documents developed in the context of GIZ‚Äôs Water Sector Reform Programme. Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF), Nairobi, Kenya In the cases of new urban/rural developments, or the retrofitting of existing ones, it is advisable to consider different alternatives regarding the design of the wastewater system, including decentralized solutions. A sustainable approach would require optimal technical solutions in terms of reliability and cost effectiveness. Eggimann, S. The optimal degree of centralisation for wastewater infrastructures. A model-based geospatial economic analysis Doctoral Thesis. ETH Zurich., 30. November 2016. From this perspective, centralized solutions might be more appropriate in many cases, depending on existing sizes of plots, topography, geology, groundwater tables and climatic conditions. But when applied adequately, decentralized systems allow for the application of environmentally friendly solutions and reuse of the treated effluent, including resource recovery. In this way, alternative water resources are provided and the environment is protected. public awareness, perceptions and support play an important part in the urban planning process for choosing adequate wastewater systems which fit the specific context.Anderson K., Dickin S., Rosemarin A.

This technology was researched and tested in South Africa where it was shown that the treatment efficiency was lower than expected.Reynaud, N. (2015). Operation of Decentralised Wastewater Treatment Systems (DEWATS) under tropical field conditions. PhD thesis, Faculty of Environmental Sciences, Technical University, Dresden A case study of a decentralized wastewater system at on- site level with treated effluent reuse was performed at the Botswana Technology Centre in Gaborone, Botswana.Hranova R (2005) The Wastewater Reuse Practice in Botswana ‚Äì a Challenge for the Development of the Water Sector, Proceedings of the BIE annual conference ‚Äì 19‚Äì21 October 2005, Gaborone, Botswana. (Proceedings in CD format) It is an example of a decentralized wastewater system, which serves one institutional building, located in an area served by municipal sewerage. Wastewater from the building is treated in a plant consisting of: septic tank, followed by planted rock filter, bio-filter and a surface flow wetland.

He was one of the founders of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in 1831, lent his legal expertise to the Underground Railroad, and served a term in the Massachusetts Senate as a Free-Soiler. Sewall was involved in several notable cases involving refugees from slavery, including George Latimer, Shadrach Minkins, Thomas Sims, Eliza Small, and Polly Ann Bates. He also worked to advance women's legal rights in Massachusetts. He was a descendant of the Puritan judge Samuel Sewall.  Early life and education  Sewall was born in Boston on November 9, 1799,Snodgrass gives his birth year as 1789; Tiffany, Merrill, and several other sources say 1799. the seventh of eleven children of Joseph Sewall and Mary (Robie) Sewall. Joseph Sewall, a great-grandson of Chief Justice Samuel Sewall, was a partner in a dry goods import business, Sewall & Salisbury, and the treasurer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Of Samuel's siblings, four died in infancy and five more died young, of consumption (tuberculosis). Samuel and his older brother Thomas were the only ones who survived their mother, who died in 1834.Tiffany (1898), pp. 5, 10. After attending Phillips Exeter Academy, Samuel entered Harvard College at the age of 13, graduating in 1817 near the top of his class. Many of his classmates at Harvard went on to distinguished careers: historian George Bancroft, politicians Caleb Cushing and Samuel A. Eliot, journalist David Lee Child, educators George B. Emerson and Alva Woods, noted clergyman Stephen H. Tyng, and reformer Samuel J. May (Sewall's cousin). In the fall of 1817 he entered the newly established Harvard Law School, receiving his LL.B. degree in 1820.Tiffany (1898), pp. 12-13.  Career  He was admitted to the bar in 1821, and went into partnership with Willard Phillips. In addition to his regular work, he edited the American Jurist and published law articles.Tiffany (1898), pp. 17 = Abolitionism = Sewall's ancestor, Samuel Sewall, was one of the first colonial abolitionists. In The Selling of Joseph, he argued that no human being could truly be owned by another; that Africans, like whites, were \\"the sons and daughters of the first Adam, the brethren and sisters of the last Adam, and the offspring of God,\\" and, as such, \\"ought to be treated with a respect agreeable.\\"Sewall (1700), quoted in Tiffany (1898), p. 33. Samuel E. Sewall's first anti-slavery article, On Slavery in the United States (1827) was more conservative. Although he condemned slavery as a \\"great national evil,\\"Sewall (1827), p. 205. he scoffed at the idea that slavery should be abolished immediately and all at once: \\"nothing could be more absurd and dangerous than a sudden enfranchisement of all the negroes.\\"Sewall (1827), p. 206. It was not until he heard William Lloyd Garrison speak that he took up the cause in earnest. With his friends Samuel J. May and A. Bronson Alcott, Sewall attended Garrison's first public lecture in Boston on October 16, 1830. Afterwards, the three of them introduced themselves to Garrison and talked with him late into the night. Garrison convinced him that \\"immediate, unconditional emancipation was the right of every slave and could not be withheld by his master an hour without sin.\\" Sewall arranged to have Garrison repeat his lecture in a better hall. Later he helped fund the Liberator, Garrison's abolitionist newspaper,Tiffany (1898), p. 36; Snodgrass (2015), p. 478. and co-founded the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society,Merrill (1979), p. 219 joining the Board of Managers in 1832. The two remained friends for many years, despite their very different personalities and frequent disagreements about strategy.Tiffany (1898), pp. 39-41. Sewall volunteered his services as a lawyer to the Society, drafting petitions, resolutions, arguments, and legal defenses, as well as preparing annual reports and writing articles for the Liberator. He also enlisted the support of other abolitionists such as Maria Weston Chapman and Ellis Gray Loring.Snodgrass (2015), p. 478. He was a trustee of the short- lived Noyes Academy in New Hampshire, an interracial school which was destroyed by a mob in 1835.Tiffany (1898), p. 43. Sewall's abolitionist convictions grew stronger over the years. In 1851 he wrote in a letter to Samuel May: > Much as I abominate bloodshed, I think it far better that two or three > slaveholders and their assistant slave-hunters should be killed than that a > man should be dragged back into slavery....I cannot blame a man for fighting > for his liberty, or anyone else for fighting for him.Tiffany (1898), p. 80. = Fugitive slave cases = On August 1, 1836, Sewall represented Eliza Small and Polly Ann Bates, two refugees from Baltimore who had been held prisoner by the captain of the Chickasaw. Sewall successfully argued that the captain had no right to detain the women, and the judge ordered their release. Immediately the agent for the slaveholder inquired about a warrant for the women's arrest. Fearing that the women were about to be seized, spectators rioted in the courtroom and ushered Small and Bates to safety. The incident came to be known as the Abolition Riot of 1836. Some commentators suspected Sewall of instigating the riot; he received threatening letters and was physically assaulted in his office by a relative of the slaveholder.Tiffany (1898), pp. 64-65 Later that month, he and Ellis Gray Loring, with the assistance of Rufus Choate, obtained the release of Med Slater, a six-year-old girl who had traveled to Boston from New Orleans in the service of Mary Aves Slater. The case was originally brought to their attention by Lydia Maria Child and the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. Loring and Sewall argued in Commonwealth v. Aves that the Massachusetts constitution banned slavery and that therefore the child was freed as soon as she entered the state.Tiffany (1898), pp. 66-68; Snodgrass (2015), pp. 478, 486. The slaveholders were barred from taking Med back to New Orleans, and she was placed in the custody of a state- appointed guardian. In 1841, Sewall brought a similar case against a Mrs. Taylor, who had brought an eight-year-old boy with her from Arkansas. In another case, that of a girl named Amy who had been brought to Boston from New Orleans, Sewall was unsuccessful; the judge allowed the slaveholder to leave with the child on the grounds that she \\"appeared happy and contented and was acting under no visible restraint.\\" Sewall was the lead defender of George and Rebecca Latimer in the fall of 1842, and when he lost the case, he and others purchased Latimer's freedom.Tiffany (1898), p. 70; Snodgrass (2015), p. 478. In 1848, he joined a litigation team in Washington D.C. that included Francis Jackson, Salmon P. Chase, Samuel Gridley Howe, Horace Mann, and Robert Morris. The group defended Daniel Drayton, the captain charged in the Pearl incident. Although Drayton was convicted, his lawyers succeeded in getting his sentence reduced from twenty years to four. In 1851, the Boston Vigilance Committee hired Sewall to help with the case of Shadrach Minkins.Snodgrass (2015), p. 479. Together with Ellis Gray Loring, Robert Morris, and Richard Henry Dana Jr., Sewall filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus calling for Minkins's release from police custody. When the petition was denied, members of the Boston Vigilance Committee rescued Minkins, who escaped to Canada with help from the Underground Railroad. That same year, Sewall teamed with Wendell Phillips to defend Thomas Sims, a refugee from Savannah, Georgia. It was the first case to challenge the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Despite concerted efforts by Sewall and Phillips, a federal commissioner upheld the law's constitutionality, and Sims was sent back to Georgia.Tiffany (1898), pp. 72-77; Snodgrass (2015), p. 479. Following the arrest of Anthony Burns in 1854, Sewall chaired a \\"Burns meeting\\" at Faneuil Hall. During the meeting, a small band of abolitionists led by Thomas Wentworth Higginson broke down the courthouse door with a battering ram in an attempt to free Burns. The plan was for hundreds of abolitionists to leave the meeting at the appointed time and help Higginson, but there was a delay of some kind, and by the time they arrived, Higginson and his cohorts had been scattered by the police.Tiffany (1898), p. 78. Sewall was not directly involved in the trial of John Brown, but afterwards he and John Albion Andrew prepared an argument in his defense to be used on appeal. The Virginia Supreme Court refused to give them a hearing. Sewall also raised funds for Brown's family. The following year, Sewall and Andrew worked together again in defense of Thaddeus Hyatt, an associate of Brown's. Hyatt was summoned before the U.S. Senate to testify about his dealings with Brown, and was jailed when he refused to testify. Despite the efforts of Sewall and Andrew to get him released, he remained in jail for three months.Tiffany (1898), pp. 104-106. = State senate term = Sewall was elected to the Massachusetts state senate in 1851 as a Free-Soil candidate. While in office he served as chairman of the judiciary committee. He introduced a bill which he claimed was the shortest ever enacted by the Massachusetts legislature: \\"Aliens may take, hold, convey, and transmit real estate.\\"Tiffany (1898), p. 96. He also introduced a number of bills which did not pass, some of which were later used as a basis for bills that did. He proposed to amend the law of evidence to prevent witnesses from being barred from testifying because of their religious beliefs or lack thereof; to make \\"extreme cruelty and habitual intemperance\\" grounds for divorce; to abolish capital punishment; to protect the property of married women; and to nullify the Fugitive Slave Law.Tiffany (1898), p. 97, 100. When his term was over, he declined to run for reelection. Later, when the Massachusetts personal liberty laws were under attack, he published a series of articles defending them.Tiffany (1898), p. 107, 109. = Women's rights = Sewall supported equal rights for women. After his death, his widow, Harriet Winslow Sewall, wrote a poem about him titled \\"The Defender of Women.\\"Tiffany (1898), p. 127. One of his clients was a woman who came to him to inquire about a divorce. Afterwards, her husband had her committed to the McLean Asylum, where she was subjected to the abusive practices that were common in such institutions at the time. While on an outing, she dropped a note for Sewall out of the carriage window, asking for his help. The note reached him, and he managed to have her released from the asylum. He then instigated legislative reforms requiring proper classification of patients in mental institutions, allowing patients to communicate with friends, and establishing visiting boards. Years later, another of his ideas was adopted: the addition of women physicians to the staff.Tiffany (1898), pp. 128-129. Sewall encouraged women reformers, such as Lucretia Mott and Sarah and Angelina Grimk√©, who were criticized for speaking in public. He supported Abby Kelley when some members of the American Anti-Slavery Society objected to her taking a prominent role in the group.Tiffany (1898), p. 130. He supported the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, and was a director of the New England Female Medical College. Marie Elizabeth Zakrzewska, a pioneering woman physician who headed a department there, later said of Sewall, \\"He served the cause for the education of medical women when this was so unpopular as to call forth ridicule upon any man who openly avowed it.\\" Sewall's own daughter Lucy eventually became a physician.Tiffany (1898), pp. 131-133 Sewall wrote articles defending women's right to hold public office, to serve on juries, and to vote. He was one of the signers of the call for the convention at which the New England Woman Suffrage Association was founded. In 1886, he published a tract titled Legal Condition of Women in Massachusetts.Tiffany (1898), pp. 133-138. He frequently appeared before the state legislature with Lucy Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell to press for reforms, and sent regular updates to the Woman's Journal. When Massachusetts women were granted the right to vote in school committee elections, he published a pamphlet of instructions for the novice voters.Tiffany (1898), pp. 142-143.  Personal life and legacy  In the summer of 1835, while attending an anti-slavery conference in New York, Sewall met a Quaker family, Nathan and Comfort Winslow of Portland, Maine, and their daughter Louisa. He married Louisa Winslow in 1836 after persuading her to become a Unitarian.Tiffany (1898), p. 23. Their first child, Lucy Ellen Sewall, was born in 1837 and went on to become a successful Boston physician. A second daughter, Louisa Winslow Sewall, was born in 1846. The family lived in Roxbury until 1848, when they moved to Melrose, Massachusetts, and later, Norfolk, Massachusetts. Sewall's first wife died in 1850; seven years later he married his late wife's widowed sister, Harriet Winslow List, a poet and editor.Tiffany (1898), pp. 31, 83, 90, 118. Sewall died of pneumonia on December 20, 1888, aged 89.Tiffany (1898), p. 165. The poet John Greenleaf Whittier, Sewall's lifelong friend and fellow abolitionist, wrote a poem in his memory.Tiffany (1898), p. 11.

It uses a glass electrolyte and lithium or sodium metal electrodes. The battery was invented by John B. Goodenough, inventor of the lithium cobalt oxide and lithium iron phosphate electrode materials used in the lithium-ion battery (Li-ion), and Maria H. Braga, an associate professor at the University of Portohttps://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=320005 and a senior research fellow at Cockrell School of Engineering at The University of Texas. The paper describing the battery was published in Energy & Environmental Science in December 2016. Hydro-Qu√©bec is researching the battery for possible production. Glass Electrolyte Research In September 2016 Iowa State University was granted U.S. $1.6 million to develop new lithium-ion-conducting glassy solid electrolytes. https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=slick-sheet-project/glassy-solid-electrolytes In August 2019, it was announced that GM was awarded U.S. $2 million by the United States Department of Energy for research into the \\"fundamental understanding of interfacial phenomena in solid-state batteries\\" and \\"hot pressing of reinforced all-solid-state batteries with sulfide glass electrolyte.\\" Skepticism The initial publication in December 2016 was met with considerable skepticism by other researchers in battery technology, with several noting that it is unclear how a battery voltage is obtained given that pure metallic lithium or sodium exists on both electrodes, which should not produce a difference in electrochemical potential, and therefore give no cell voltage. Any energy stored or released by the battery would therefore violate the first law of thermodynamics. Goodenough's high reputation was enough to deter the strongest criticism however, with Daniel Steingart of Princeton University commenting, \\"If anyone but Goodenough published this, I would be, well, it's hard to find a polite word.\\" A formal comment was published by Steingart and Venkat Viswanathan from Carnegie Mellon University in Energy & Environmental Science. Goodenough responded to the skepticism, stating: \\"The answer is that if the lithium plated on the cathode current collector is thin enough for its reaction with the current collector to have its Fermi energy lowered to that of the current collector, the Fermi energy of the lithium anode is higher than that of the thin lithium plated on the cathode current collector.\\" Goodenough went on to say in a later interview with Slashdot that the lithium plated on the cathode is on the \\"order of a micron thick\\". Goodenough's response has drawn further skepticism from Daniel Steingart and also Matthew Lacey of Uppsala University, who point out that this underpotential deposition effect is only known for extremely thin layers (monolayers) of materials. Lacey also notes that the original publication does not mention a limit to the thickness of the lithium plated on the cathode, but instead states the opposite: that the capacity of the cell is \\"determined by the amount of alkali metal used as the anode\\".  Construction and electrochemistry  The battery, as reported in the original publication, is constructed using an alkali metal (lithium or sodium foil) as the negative electrode (anode), and a mixture of carbon and a redox active component, as the positive electrode (cathode). The cathode mixture is coated onto copper foil. The redox active component is either sulfur, ferrocene, or manganese dioxide. The electrolyte is a highly conductive glass formed from lithium hydroxide and lithium chloride and doped with barium, allowing fast charging of the battery without the formation of metal dendrites. The publication states the battery operates during discharge by stripping the alkali metal from the anode and re-depositing it at the cathode, with the battery voltage determined by the redox active component and the capacity of the battery determined by the amount of the alkali metal anode. This operating mechanism is radically different from the insertion (intercalation) mechanism of most conventional Li-ion battery materials. In 2018, a new version was described by most of the same authors in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, in which the cathode is coated with a special plasticiser solution to avoid interface cracking as different materials expand at different rates. Braga says the new battery has twice the energy density of conventional lithium ion batteries, and can be recharged 23,000 times. Critics pointed out several extraordinary claims in the paper, such as a record-high relative dielectric constant; perhaps higher than any material recorded, and a raise in the capacitance of the battery over many charge cycles, rather than a decrease as is usually the case with all other battery technologies. The paper was also not clear if the battery could hold its charge after it is unplugged, which would clarify whether it is really a new battery technology, or simply a capacitor. Braga responded to critics, saying \\"Data is data, and we have similar data from many different cells, in four different instruments, different labs, glove box. And at the end of the day, the LEDs are lit for days with a very small amount of active material after having cycled for more than 23,000 times\\".  Comparison with lithium-ion batteries  Braga and Goodenough stated they expect the battery to have an energy density many times higher than current lithium-ion batteries, as well as an operating temperature range down to ; much lower than current solid-state batteries. The electrolyte is also stated to have a wide electrochemical window. The battery's design is safer than lithium-ion batteries, as the use of a flammable liquid electrolyte is avoided. The battery can also be made using low-cost sodium instead of lithium. The authors claim the battery has a much shorter charging time than Li-ion batteries‚Äîin minutes rather than hours. The authors also state they tested the stability of the alkali metal/electrolyte interface over 1,200 charge cycles with low cell resistance; the specification for Li-ion batteries is usually less than a thousand.Tim De Chant, \\"Super-Safe Glass Battery Charges in Minutes, Not Hours\\", NovaNext, 17 March 2017.Mark Anderson, \\"Will a New Glass Battery Accelerate the End of Oil?\\", IEEE Spectrum, 3 March 2017  See also  * List of battery types  References  Category:Metal-ion batteries Category:Solid-state batteries ","title":"Glass battery"},{"id":"53547712","text":"Hwang In-sun (born 2 February 1976) is a South Korean women's international footballer who plays as a midfielder.

LaFortune was an early organizer of the Native American LGBT community in the 1980s and co-founded the Two Spirit Press Room (2SPR). In 1988, LaFortune helped to organize a meeting of LGBT Native Americans in Minnesota that later became the annual International Two Spirit Gathering. LaFortune began working in health and human services and by 1991 he served on the Governor's Task Force on Lesbian and Gay Minnesotans during the peak of the AIDS epidemic. In 1997, LaFortune continued his two spirit activism by writing a chapter in the book Two-Spirit People: Native American Gender Identity, Sexuality, and Spirituality which was acclaimed by scholars for its personal accounts and effort to change the anthropological narrative around two spirit people. LaFortune appeared in the 2009 PBS documentary, Two Spirit, that narrates the story of Fred Martinez, a two spirit teenager, and included interviews with many two spirit individuals.  Early life  LaFortune was adopted by a white missionary couple from the Moravian church at the age of four, but remembers that his biological mother came from a lineage of Yupik medicine people and spiritual leaders. As a child LaFortune lived in Alberta, Canada and then a small town in upper Michigan. LaFortune was interested in music as a child and went on to study piano at Moravian College in Pennsylvania. From a young age LaFortune knew his \\"identity did not fit into a usual category of Western society,\\" and as a young adult he remembers Native elders making comments to him \\"about the presence of third gender people in Native cultures.\\"  Start of activism  LaFortune first became an activist in 1979 following the Three Mile Island accident, which took place near Moravian College where he studied music. Following the accident LaFortune worked with anti-war and anti-nuclear weapon organizations in the 1970s. He later became the executive director of Honor the Earth, a Native American environmental justice organization. In the 1980s LaFortune immersed himself in the Native American communities of Ojibway, Dakota, Lakota, and Ho-Chunk people living in Minnesota and in the American gay community. After seeing an advertisement in the gay magazine RFD, LaFortune traveled to San Francisco for several weeks to attend meetings of the Gay American Indians. He returned to Minneapolis and held the first Minneapolis meeting of LGBT Native Americans in 1988, which later became the International Two Spirit Gathering.  Two Spirit activism  In 2005, LaFortune co-founded the Two Spirit Press Room (2SPR), a network of journalists and community leaders in the two spirit community. In an interview with the online newspaper NativeOut, LaFortune said the press room was meant to build \\"media literacy among Native GLBT communities and cultural literacy among journalists, so that the beliefs and stereotypes of non-Native people are no longer imposed upon us\\". One of the first actions of the Two Spirit Press Room was to publish a \\"Community Briefing Handbook\\", meant to educate the public about two spirit people. Through a number of events, LaFortune gained increasing recognition in the Minneapolis community. In 2005, he was the first native person to lead the Twin Cities GLBT Pride Parade. In 2008, he was interviewed by the independent radio station KFAI, and in 2010, he was featured in the book Queer Twin Cities. LaFortune served on the advisory board of the Tretter GLBT Collection, a part of the University of Minnesota Archives, and compiled over 250 documents for the collection. LaFortune was featured in the 2009 PBS documentary film, Two Spirt, directed by Lydia Nibley. In the film LaFortune speaks about the murder of Fred Martinez, a two spirit teenager, and about the history of discrimination against two spirit people in America.  Writing  LaFortune wrote a chapter in the 1997 book Two-spirit People titled A Postcolonial Colonial Perspective on Western Mis Conceptions of the Cosmos and the Restoration of Indigenous Taxonomies. The book was reviewed by several anthropological journals and praised for its role in changing the narrative around two spirit people. Previous academic writing had used the now outdated term \\"berdache\\" to describe two spirit people often in terms of Western gender conceptions. One journal noted that LaFortune's section was \\"the most unique\\" because it gives a voice to two spirit people to \\"reflect on their experiences and express their concerns and desires,\\". In 1999, LaFortune wrote a report on Native Languages as part of the Native Language Research Initiative with funding from the Grotto Foundation.

The further improved and larger Potez 25 was preferred for production. Design and development The Potez 24 was designed to fill the same two seat army co-operation role (French military category A.2) as the Potez 15 but with performance improved by extra power and a new, wing design. Both upper and lower wings were rectangular in plan, with the lower one both shorter in span and smaller in chord. Each was built around a pair of spars and was wood-framed and fabric covered. The upper wing was in three parts; the centre section, held over the fuselage with four vertical cabane struts, had a trailing edge cut-out to improve the crew's field of view. The lower wing was in two parts, joined to the lower fuselage longerons. The Potez 24 was a single bay biplane with pairs of parallel, outward-leaning dural interplane struts between the spars, aided by wire bracing. It had only of stagger and, compared with the Potez 15, the interplane gap was larger. There were long, broad ailerons on the upper wing alone. The engine mounting of the Potez 24 drew contemporary interest because it allowed for the installation of several different motors, for example the W12, water-cooled Lorraine 12E Courlis and the similar Hispano-Suiza 12Ga. Engine and frame swaps involved only disconnection of supply and control lines and the removal of four bolts. The radiator was in the nose ahead of the engine, its segmental shape allowing a neat, rounded upper cowling. Aft, the fuselage was flat-sided apart from rounded decking. The pilot's cockpit was below the upper wing cut- out, with the observer/machine gunner close behind. The empennage of the Potez 24 was conventional, with a rectangular plan tailplane on top of the fuselage carrying wider, balanced elevators. A broad fin carried the generous rudder. The Potez 24 had a fixed, tailskid undercarriage with a track. Its single axle, enclosed in a fairing, was joined to the lower fuselage longerons by near-vertical, telescopic shock absorbing legs and faired, rearward drag struts. Instead of the usual cross-wires the structure had a single diagonal cross-bracing tube. The tailskid was rubber-sprung. The date of the first flight of the Potez 24 is not known but had taken place shortly before the beginning of September 1924. Towards the end of 1924 Potez flew the rather similar but larger type 25, which shared amongst other things a biplane layout and the quick-change engine mountings. After comparative tests of the two types at Villacoublay test centre in the spring of 1925 the Army preferred the later model, awarding it a contract, and development of the Potez 24 ceased.

He worked as a systems design engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratories in 1963-65. He received his doctorate from the Harvard Business School in 1972 and joined the Harvard Business School faculty as an Assistant Professor. On leave from HBS, he helped found and teach at the Iran Center for Management Studies during 1972-74. In 1976 he joined the faculty of Management at the UCLA school of business. In 1993 he was appointed to the Harry and Elsa Kunin Chair in Business and Society. During 1993-96 he taught at INSEAD (France), where he received the Shell Chair in Management. Rumelt Rumelt was a founding member of the Strategic Management Society and served as its president in 1995-98. He is noted for having made several key contributions to the study of business and corporate strategy. His 1974 study of diversification strategy inaugurated a stream of work on the performance implications of diversification. His 1982 paper with Steven Lippman showed how classical industrial organization results---profitability being related to concentration and to market share---could arise under perfect competition if there was uncertainty in the sources of efficiency. This result was key in the development of the \\"resource-based view\\" of strategic success. Rumelt's 1991 empirical follow-on (How Much Does Industry Matter?) showed that the most of the dispersion of profit rates in the economy was between business units rather than between industries. His 2011 book (Good Strategy/Bad Strategy) redefined strategy as a form of problem solving. It was chosen one of six finalists for the Financial Times & Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year award for 2011.

Description Leptospermum nitens is a slender shrub that typically grows to a height of about with thin, fibrous bark on the older branches and younger stems with soft, silky hairs at first. The leaves are narrow egg-shaped to narrow wedge-shaped, long and wide on a short petiole. The flowers are white or pink, about wide and are borne singly or in pairs on short side shoots. The floral cup is about long and is covered with flattened silky hairs, on a pedicel about long. The sepals are triangular, about long and covered with flattened hairs like those on the floral cup. The petals are about long and the stamens about long. Flowering occurs from July to October, or in December or January and the fruit is a capsule long with the remains of the sepals attached, but that falls from the plant when the seeds mature. Taxonomy and naming Leptospermum nitens was first formally described in 1852 by Nikolai Turczaninow in the Bulletin de la Classe Physico-Math√©matique de l'Acad√©mie Imp√©riale des Sciences de Saint-P√©tersbourg from material collected by James Drummond.

At the time of his death, DuBois was one of the oldest living persons in the Imperial Valley and one of the most successful water rights lobbyists in California. Early life DuBois was born on September 25, 1916, in Orcutt, California to John Lamont DuBois and Isabelle Oakley. John L. DuBois emigrated from Tennessee in 1906 to work as an oil engineer. In 1913, he met Oakley, who worked as a school teacher for the children of oil field workers. Like DuBois, she was the oldest child of a Tennessee family.The two were soon married and had three sons; William, Andy (b. 1920), and Jack =Agriculture career= The DuBois family moved to El Centro, CA in 1918 when Isabelle's father, William Calvin Oakley, purchased 240 acres of sand dunes land.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/ivpressonline/obituary.aspx?pid=185065100 After cultivating the dunes to arable land, the family spent the 1920s growing citrus, raising hogs, and operating a dairy. The whole family initially lived in a raised canvas tent under a cottonwood tree, without electricity or running water. Later, a WWI surplus generator provided the family with electricity for the first time. =Education= DuBois attended grade school at Silsbee School. He graduated from Central Union High School in Class of 1934 (icfb.net, 2008) while working summers in a Sunkist packing shed. He pursued a degree in agriculture at University of Southern California and graduated with a bachelor‚Äôs in agronomy from the Voorhis-Kellogg Campus (later known as the Don B. Huntly College of Agriculture of Cal Poly) in 1943. For a time he was the oldest known living graduate from Cal Poly Pomona.

He left the parish school of Gairloch at an early age, and was apprenticed to an itinerant carpenter and joiner. An accident at work met compelled him to return to Gairloch. In 1833 Mackenzie went to Glasgow, pursuing publishing projects. In 1836 he was appointed a book-keeper in the Glasgow University printing-office. He then worked for the Edinburgh publisher Maclachlan & Stewart. Mackenzie died at Poolewe on 19 August 1848. A monument over his grave was erected by public subscription in 1878.

She was a gifted linguist. Besides speaking English, she spoke French, German, Portuguese, Latin and Ancient and Modern Greek. She and Hetty Goldman were the first two women to direct an archeological dig in mainland Greece.  Early life and education  Alice Leslie Walker was born on June 26, 1885 to Josephine Kinney and James Greig Walker in San Francisco, California. She attended Vassar College and obtained her AB degree with honours in Greek language and Greek Archeologyin 1906 and an MA in 1908.  Archeological career  Walker attended the American School of Classical Studies in Athens from 1909 to 1914 on a fellowship in archeology. In 1910 she worked on publishing all the pottery finds of the Byzantine era excavated at Corinth. In the spring of 1911, Walker and Hetty Goldman, both financially independent, excavated at Halae at Locris at their own expense. Goldman and Walker were the first two women to lead an excavation in mainland Greece. They established their field site at the city of Theologu, an area where relics were being sold by local villagers. The two women supervised laborers in digging for skeletons and the remains of homes from the era 1000 BC. \\"Foundations of houses were unearthed. Terra cotta statuary was found in large quantities. The foundations of a Byzantine church of the twelfth of thirteenth century was encountered.\\" The work on the project continued in 1912, but was halted due to the Balkans Wars. in 1914 they were back in Athens working at the American School on their excavation finds. In 1913 Walker became ill with Malaria and due to her inability to tolerate quinine, she lost a good part of her hearing and suffered ill effects from the disease for the rest of her life. In 1914 and 1915, Goldman and Walker were at Corinth excavating. Walker uncovered \\"the largest and probably still the most significant deposit of Early Neolithic pottery from Corinth.\\" The archeological dig was interrupted by the beginning of World War I. She obtained her PHD at the University of California, Berkeley in 1917. Her dissertation was on \\"The Pottery of the Necropolis of Locrian Halae\\". It was never published. She worked diligently to improve the lives of women at the American School, encouraging the administration to provide housing for women at the school. Being financially independent, she also became a major donor of the school. During the 1920s, Walker worked on the pottery uncovered at Corinth at Corinth's expedition headquarters. Working on excavations until 1935, Walker continued to add artifacts to her new finds of pottery of the Neolithic period. At this point in her career, she had become the foremost expert of the Neolithic Period in Southern Greece. There was a great deal of tension during this time period between Acting Director of the American School, Edward Capps and Walker. He had continued to press for publication on the Corinth pottery and Walker continued to delay publishing her findings. In 1921, Walker's plan to dig at Halal in the fall had to be cancelled due to a recurrence of her illness. In 1924, she married her expedition foreman Georgios A. KosmopoulosIn. In 1924‚Äì1925 she was in Corinth working on prehistoric pottery. Walker continued to work on the Corinth Pottery thru the late 1920s and 1930s and also continued to delay publication. There were new conflicts between the American School's new director in 1936, Charles H. Morgan II over Walker moving the Corinth material that belonged to the American School to the Museum of Athens. Morgan demanded the return of the Corinth property and Walker responded by sending some material back to the American School and hiding other material in boxes labeled for a different site. This material stayed hidden until it was discovered in the Athen's museum storeroom in the 1980s in a crate labeled \\"Halae\\" The outbreak of World War II halted Walker's archeological work, and she and her husband moved back to the United States. They lived in Santa Barbara for the remainder of their lives. The bitterness on Walker's part toward the American School at the time she left Athens, led her to have her work finally published by a German publisher rather than the American School. Walker died in Santa Barbara June 25, 1954.

He was Minister for Housing and Urban Development in the government of Peter O'Neill from 2012 to 2017. Prior to entering politics, Isikiel was a businessman and the manager of Suapi Management Consultant Limited (SMC). He was an unsuccessful candidate at the 2007 election. He was elected to the National Parliament at the 2012 election as a People's National Congress candidate, defeating MP Koni Iguan. He was appointed Minister for Housing and Urban Development in the post-election Cabinet reshuffle. He supported the Markham Valley Oil Palm Project, which had been initiated under his predecessor, and claimed early success in gaining funding for two regional roads and a vocational training centre, with and a third road following in December. In September 2012, he suspended the managing director and board chairman of the National Housing Corporation pending an investigation over alleged misappropriation. In April 2013, he funded a double classroom and two school dormitories for the Markham Valley High School. In June 2013, he announced that the National Housing Corporation debt had been cut from K30 million to K19 million under his replacement leadership, as the organisation underwent an administrative overhaul. In May 2014, he announced a 40,000-house project at Durand Farm outside Port Moresby to relieve housing shortages in the capital. A K1.4 billion loan to fund the project was attacked by the opposition as being a burden on the economy. Isikiel publicly feuded with the Police Association of Papua New Guinea and senior police in July 2014 after calling for the arrest of \\"rogue\\" police investigating a corruption case linked to Prime Minister O'Neill; he claimed the \\"rogue\\" police had \\"colluded with outside forces in an attempt to discredit and incriminate the Prime Minister\\". He also clashed with the Manufacturers Council of Papua New Guinea in November 2014 over a proposal that \\"certain building materials\\" be exempted from import duty to make housing cheaper. In March 2016, he announced a 500-house project to house public servants outside Kundiawa to relieve housing shortages in that area. He faced further problems later in 2016 with illegal sales of government housing and controversy surrounding evictions by the National Housing Corporation.

It can mean two similar things: the behavior itself, the description of the partner's behavior. The behavior could be unprotected vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse. The partner could be a nonexclusive partner, HIV-positive, or an intravenous drug user. Drug use is associated with risky sexual behaviors. Factors Risky sexual behavior can be: *Barebacking, i.e. sex without a condom. *Mouth-to-genital contact. *Starting sexual activity at a young age. *Having multiple sex partners. *Having a high-risk partner, someone who has multiple sex partners or infections. *Anal sex without condom and proper lubrication. *Sex with a partner who has ever injected drugs. *Engaging in sex work. Risky sexual behavior includes unprotected intercourse, multiple sex partners, and illicit drug use. The use of alcohol and illicit drugs greatly increases the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, hepatitis B, and HIV/AIDS. Trauma from penile-anal sex has been identified as a risky sexual behavior. North American adolescents can be sexually active yet do not take appropriate precautions to prevent infection or pregnancies. Misconceptions of invulnerability and the practice of ignoring long-term consequences of their behavior tend to promote risky sexual behavior. Risky sexual behaviors can lead to serious consequences both for person and their partner(s). This sometimes includes cervical cancer, ectopic pregnancy and infertility. An association exists between those with a higher incidence of body art (body piercings and tattoos) and risky sexual behavior. Alcohol is the most commonly used substance among youth. Research indicates that alcohol can lead to risky sexual behavior including lack of condom use, sexual intercourse with a non-primary partner, as well as lower likelihood of using contraception in general. Epidemiology Most Canadian and American adolescents aged 15 to 19 years describe having had sexual intercourse at least one time. In the same population, 23.9% and 45.5% of young, adolescent females describe having sex with two or more sexual partners during the previous year. Of the males in the same population 32.1% of Canadian males had two or more partners and 50.8% of American males also describe a similar experience. Interventions Several factors linked to risky sexual behaviors ‚Äì inconsistent condom use, alcohol use, polysubstance abuse, depression, lack of social support, recent incarceration, residing with a partner, and exposure to intimate partner violence and childhood sexual abuse ‚Äì may represent appropriate intervention points to prevent subsequent risky sexual behavior; however, further research is needed to establish the exact causal relationship between these factors and risky sexual behaviors.Engstrom, M, Winham, KM, & Gilbert, L.

She received the commission August 16, 1889, took charge of the office September 15, 1889, and was confirmed by the United States Senate December 19, 1889. Hawes received a salary of US$2,600 a year and managed 13 employees, four of whom were women. At that time, she was the youngest woman in the US holding this position, and her office was the second largest in the US controlled by a woman.

The actual bore diameter was , but the classification system for artillery rounded up to the next highest centimeter. History The origins of the ≈†koda 24 cm L/40 K97 lay in an earlier gun designed and built by the Krupp company in Germany. In 1894 Krupp designed the 24 cm SK L/40 and started production in 1898 for the Imperial German Navy's pre-dreadnought battleships and armored cruisers. Krupp produced a variant of the 24 cm SK L/40 for the Austro-Hungarian Navy called the 24 cm L/40 K94 which armed their armored cruiser SMS Kaiser Karl VI, the pre- dreadnought Habsburg-class battleships and the Monarch-class coastal defense ships. In 1897 ≈†koda bought a production license from Krupp and began production in 1904 at the Pilsen works of the ≈†koda 24 cm L/40 K97 and later the ≈†koda designed 24 cm L/40 K/01. Both Germany and Austria-Hungary developed their own ammunition with differing weights and lengths, however their ballistic performance was similar. Construction The 24 cm SK L/40 was the first large caliber German naval gun to use a Krupp horizontal sliding-wedge breech block and separate loading metallic cased propellant charges and projectiles. Unlike other large naval guns of the time which used separate loading bagged charges and projectiles, this gun used charges inside of a brass cartridge case to provide obturation. It is believed that the K94 and the K97 were both constructed of A tube, three layers of reinforcing hoops and a jacket. Naval artillery The ≈†koda 24 cm L/40 K97 was the primary armament of the Erzherzog Karl-class of pre-dreadnought battleships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The Krupp built K94 guns of the unique armored cruiser SMS Kaiser Karl VI were later replaced with ≈†koda built K97 guns during a refit in 1916. While the ≈†koda designed 24 cm L/40 K/01 armed the unique armored cruiser SMS Sankt Georg. :Ship details: :* Erzherzog Karl-class - The three ships of this class had a primary armament of four guns, which were mounted in two twin gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. :* SMS Kaiser Karl VI - This ship had a primary armament of two K94 guns later replaced with K97 guns, which were mounted in two single gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. :* SMS Sankt Georg - This ship had a primary armament of two ≈†koda designed 24 cm L/40 K/01 guns, which were mounted in two single gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure.

The float followed the acquisition of two other businesses, the Australian operation of Wayfair and Milan Direct. Overview Temple & Webster was founded in 2011 by Mark Coulter, Adam McWhinney, Conrad Yiu and Brian Shanahan. The site was initially a members-only sales site, but became an open retailer in 2016 after merging the Wayfair brand. In 2015 the company was awarded the Fastest Growing Internet Retailer in the Deloitte Tech Fast 50. Later that year the business released an IPO to raise $61 million, expecting a market capitalisation of $116 million. The IPO was oversubscribed, but shares fell over 30% on opening, taking their market value to $95 million. It was announced that, in 2015, Temple & Webster lost $44.4 million, more than double the $18.5 million loss forecast in its prospectus. In December 2016 the business merged the Milan Direct ecommerce site into the Temple & Webster brand. Milan Direct continues to operate as a wholesaler and importer, supplying product to the Temple & Webster site.

The astronomic event, part of the Saros 133 cycle, took place during the Spanish War of Succession, crossing Spain, France and Northern Italy: for this reason it was seen at the time as a metaphor and a premonitory sign of the decline of King Louis XIV of France (known as the Sun King) \\"occulted\\" by the Great Alliance. Description The eclipse was visible in north and west Africa along with all Europe and its islands, Asia including the most of Middle East and almost all of Siberia and a small part of northeastern North America and the northern islands. It was also visible in the Atlantic. A very small portion occurred in the Southern Hemisphere almost entirely over the ocean. It was part of solar saros 133. The umbral portion which was as far as 242 km (150 mi), it included areas that were 150 miles (250 km) northwest of the Cape Verdean island of Santo Ant√£o (then a Portuguese colony) in the Atlantic, the Spanish controlled Canary Islands, Morocco including Casablanca, Rabat, Tangier and Tetouan, Gibraltar, Spain including M√°laga, Valencia and Barcelona, France including Grenoble, Lyon, N√Æmes and Marseilles, Switzerland, Munich, Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland), Mazuria, much of the Baltic, Saint Petersburg, Russia, newly founded at the time and a part of the Russian north including the Samoyedic and Yakut areas and up to Manchuria. The greatest occurred in the area between Saxony and Lower Silesia (now in Poland) at 51.5 N, 15.2 E at 9:35 UTC (10:35 CET) and lasted for over 4 minutes. The eclipse showed up to 50% obscuration in Burkina Faso, Mai, Songhai, Benghazi in Libya, Ankara, Sinope, the north of the Caspian and a part of Mongola and on the other side, northwestern Islands and the east shore of Greenland. It was 75% obscuration in places like Norway, Lapland and Zemlya and on the other side around Bissau, Syracuse in Sicily and Bucharest. Places that was 25% obscuration of the sun included Kingdom of Benin, Egypt and Babylon in Iraq (then commonly as Mesopotamia). Areas that were on the rim of the eclipse included Gabon, Darfur, Nubia, the north of the Arabian Peninsula, Persia, the Arghan Empire, Nepal, Assam and Manchurian controlled Yunnan. The eclipse started in the middle of the Atlantic and finished at sunset in Siberia, Korea and China. The subsolar marking was in Nubia.  Scientific and historical significance  The eclipse was the first to be the subject of predictive maps.Robert H. van Gent,18th-Century Maps of Solar Eclipse Paths\\" Unlike the famous Halley's eclipse of 1715, the eclipse was not total in England.

De Valera told Sibilot, he has a story which can save the journalist's career but only if Sibilot rejects to give him to the police. After that we can spectate the way of Georges De Valera becoming Nikita Nekrassov - an escaped soviet minister - and how he made his life to the level of the national hero of France.  Scenes  = Scene 1 = The opening scene is the dialogue of a homeless man and his wife about a man on the bridge ready to jump into the river. There is an argument between them whether help the man or let him die; whether they should take the man's jacket or not. Finally they decide to help the man, against his will. After some really morally difficult dialogues, the police arrived looking for Georges De Valera, swindler and wanted criminal. Georges pretends to be sleeping but suddenly he made his way away and escaped the officers. The homeless people jumped into the River Seine. = Scene 2 = The setting is the office of Jules Palotin. The secretary and Palotin having a discussion about photographs, the administrative committee and President Mouton. Sibiliot entering the scene with his shy and perplexed behaviour. He draws up his unfortunate situation, that he only gets 70000 monthly, and his wife is ill and is in a hospital. Palotin refuses to increase his salary unless Sibilot comes up with a brand new idea about the Communists' terror or the wrongs of Soviet Union. When Sibilot left, Tavernier and P√©rigord enters the office. They are talking about the headline of the paper. Both employees have no great ideas to come up with, which makes Palotin frustrated. \\"Good news\\" appeared: Nekrassov, Soviet Interior Minister, defected from the Soviet Union and in the same time, Georges De Valera, the greatest criminal mind of their age, escaped. Both can be great stories, thought Palotin. Later Mouton appeared and provoked Palotin to write a better article, a bigger news against the communists, reminding the editor the old great quality of the paper. Finally Sibilot accepted to write the article, and went home. = Scene 3 = Georges De Valera - chased by the police officers - jumps into Sibilot's house, and meets Veronica. Georges thought he will be recognized as a thief by the girl and the girl would scream and panic, but it happened differently. Veronica behaved very calm even if she suspected that a criminal was standing in front of her. After the initial shock, they started to talk. From their dialogue the reader can gather some information about Georges, for instance, he is a great actor and that he does not trust women. They get to know each other a bit, and it results that Veronica sends off the police officers who finally got to her home. Meanwhile, Sibilot arrives home and Georges hides in the bedroom. Veronika and her father discusses the day, the unfortunate twist in the man's career and that he needs some idea. Veronica tells Sibilot that there is an unknown man in their home, but she thinks that the arrest of the man is unnecessary. When Veronica left for work, Sibilot started thinking, however, Georges' sneezing interrupted him too many times and he got angry. Sibilot wanted to call the police, but Georges - as usual - talked about an idea which he will only reveal at the editor's office, but it is perfect and it can save Sibilot. = Scene 4 = The setting is the office again. Palotin and the journalists are brainstorming about the headline and about the next really great article that they should create. Sibilot is late, the boss is angry and he now wants to fire poor Sibilot. Sibilot finally arrived accompanied with Georges. First, they wanted to imitate that Georges couldn't speak their language but after the meaningless argument Georges have been introduced as Nekrassov. After that moment, Sibilot became the hero of the day as he brought the sensation of the day. Doing the habitual routine Georges successfully manipulated Palotin to believe he is Nikita Nekrassov. Then they started to talk about the great and secret information which Nekrassov might has. The Administration Committee were invited into the office, and Nekrassov started to point out - of course, randomly - the members who are \\"on the list of people who will be executed\\". Almost every member \\"will be shot\\" except the president, Mouton. Hearing this, Mouton lost his sanity because of the wound on his pride, and swore that he will destroy the newspaper, Palotin and Nekrassov as well. Then when Mouton disappeared, and they tried to figure out the future of the committee, Georges started to tell his claims. He needs guards, a place to live, some money and to increase Sibilot's salary from 70,000 to 210,000. = Scene 5 = The scene starts at the hotel room of Georges. He received a bouquet of roses and he told the two guards that it is dangerous and poisonous: and the poison is hatred. The guard did not really understand. Then Sibilot enters the room, while Georges is talking to himself in the mirror. The dialogue between the two might imply that Georges started to forget his real identity to become Nekrassov. After some deep talk and some round of practice, Sibilot also acts as Georges is Nikita Nekrassov. Later on Veronica visits Georges. They are having a conversation full of suspicious elements of both sides which made the whole situation absurd: they do not trust each other but in the same time they like each other. Veronica makes Georges frustrated and angry: she thinks Georges only a mean person who use everybody to his own benefit and then leaves his victims. This is not true, thinks Georges, he is just takink part in the political field. At the end of the scene Georges is getting ready for the party at Bounoumin√© and destroying his room because of his rage. = Scene 6 = Everyone is present at the party and they are celebrating Perdri√©re. Everything seemed peaceful until Baudouin and Chapuis - the supervisors of the defensive division - announced that there is a probability of assassination or any kind of terrorism. The atmosphere started to be heated when Mouton suddenly appeared with Demidoff on his side. He brought the Russian, to reveal the true identity of Nekrassov. When Mouton saw Nekrassov he and Demidoff started their plan. However, Georges planned quickly and asked the guards to make everyone leave the room because he wanted to talk with Demidoff in private. It succeeded and he could manipulate Demidoff to accept his identity as Nekrassov. When their conversation ended, everyone returned and Mouton asked whether that man is Nekrassov or not. Demidoff said, yes. Mouton rushed towards Nekrassov and attempted to assassinate him with a revolver but Bounoumin√© and Chapuis stopped Mouton and disarmed him. The guards came in and took Mouton out. Near the end of the scene it turns out that Baudouin and Chapuis know the truth about Georges and they want to make him testify against Robert Duval and Charles Maistre. Georges managed to escape with the help of the drunk Demidoff who made enough turmoil to distract everyone so Georges could escape as soon as possible. = Scene 7 = George returned to Veronica, and now they seems to be really into each other. They are discussing their present situation when suddenly the police and the defensive division arrived with some medics - the DD wanted to make Veronica believe that Georges lost his sanity - to gather Georges and take him to prison or some hidden base. However, Demidoff, who is still under the effect of the beverages, wanted to claim his new colleague as well so he knocked out everyone so Georges and Veronica could escape, and never return. = Scene 8 = The members of the Administration Committee are suffering the aftereffect of the party at the previous night. Everyone is tired or hangover. The beaten defensive division arrived to make their situation look better: they told everyone that Nekrassov was Georges De Valera, and when they went to get him, a group of communist soldiers were protecting him, that's why they are in this condition. The Committee makes Mouton their president again, they decide to fire Palotin because of his bad decisions, and they choose to make Sibilot the editor in Chief of the Soir √° Paris.  Characters  = Georges De Valera / Nikita Nekrassov = Actor: Michel Vitold Georges De Valera is the protagonist of the drama. His story begins on a bridge, ready to fall into the river to commit suicide. Although, he couldn't make his plan because of the homeless couple who saw him. After the police arrived, he escaped hastily and jumped into the home of Sibilot and his daughter, Veronica. After manipulating Sibilot, his life changed: Everyone started to believe his story - he also - that he is the escaped soviet minister, Nekrassov, and that he had some important and top secret information about the Russian and the Communist Party. One of the most important documents - which probably has never existed - is the list of people who will be executed. = Sibilot = Actor: Jean Par√©d√©s A poor middle-aged journalist who writes anti-communist propaganda for a right-wing French newspaper, the Soir √° Paris. He lives with his daughter Veronica. His scene starts with his statement to his boss - Jules Palotin - to raise his salary because what he gets a month is simply not enough for living. This request was dismissed. Then Sibilot got into trouble when his future career has been bound to a newsworthy article about the Communists - this is the reason why he accepted the help of the swindler Georges. = Jules Palotin = Editor in Chief of the Soir √° Paris, boss of Sibilot, Tavernier and P√©rigord. He is very emotional, he is very connected to the newspaper and the editorial staff: his only goal to make his paper great. He is also the \\"victim\\" of Georges: he believes that Georges is Nekrassov and he also convinces his employees about this false information. Very kind - except the case of Sibilot when he refused Sibilot's request - but very naive. He has the power over the editorial staff but he is afraid the Administrative Committee and its president, Mouton. = Veronica = Smart and young daughter of Sibilot. She is also a journalist but she works for a communist party newspaper. She has encountered Georges in the beginning, and showed no fear or obedience towards Georges. She always wants to open up De Valera's eyes to make him see his own selfish and coward personality. At the end they both disappear together. = Goblet = Actor: R. J. Chauffard Detective whose main purpose to chase Georges De Valera everywhere. However, his success is always interrupted by someone. = Tavernier and P√©rigord = Actors: Robert Seller and Cl√©ment Harari Employees of Palotin, they are journalists. They both respect and obey Palotin, which makes them simple, naive and underwitted. = Mouton = Actor: Jean Toulout The president of the Administrative Committee who holds Palotin in his hands. We discover his overflowing pride, when he discovers that he is not on the list of people to be executed. He decides to reveal the true identity of Nekrassov and destroy Palotin's newspaper. = Nerciat, Leminier, Charivet, Bergerat = Actors: Georges Sellier, Daniel Mendaille, Max M√©gy, Lef√©vre-bel Members of the Administrative Committee, they have the same function in the drama as Tavernier and P√©rigord but they are loyal to Mouton and not Palotin. = First Guard, Second Guard = Bodyguards of Nikita Nekrassov (Georges) who protect the impostor from any harm. Later, we get to know that they are spies, who have been making photos of Georges, to reveal the truth and to threaten him. = Baudouin and Chapuis = Supervisors of the Defensive Division. They get Georges at the end to make him testify against Robert Duval and Charles Maistre. = Demidoff = Russian minister, escaped from the Soviet Union. He knows the real Nikita Nekrassov, and that's why he almost revealed Georges to Mouton at the party. However, Demidoff is also a brute-like underwitted person. Georges learned that if Demidoff drinks too much alcohol, he becomes a raging beast. Taking advantage of this \\"defect\\", Georges manages to escape both the party and the arrest at the end.  Philosophy of Sartre  In Nekrassov the reader can spectate several issues which exist in the philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre. The question of identity as Georges fights with himself to decide which identity is the stronger (Nekrassov or Georges) is one of the key elements. However, the issue of power and the structure of the hierarchy also appears in the hierarchy of the Soir √° Paris. The human folly and that we try to manipulate and own other people, and how it affects our moral life also a great deal in the drama, and in the Being and Nothingness as well.

It follows the adventures of a Scottish chaplain on an exoplanet colony. Oasis was part of the 2017 pilot season wave 8 by Amazon Video. The series' central character is chaplain Peter Leigh, played by Richard Madden, who is unexpectedly asked to travel to a remote planet, where USIC, a mysterious company, is building the first permanent off-world human colony, as environmental collapse shows Earth's habitability for humans is coming to an end. On arrival at the colony, Leigh discovers there have been a series of accidents, which are being blamed on hallucinations some colonists are experiencing. The method of space travel to the presumed exoplanet is not shown, but it requires a launch from Earth with a traditional rocket. The exoplanet is presented as covered by a desert- like landscape, apparently without vegetation or other forms of life, but having natural underground water resources and a breathable atmosphere. It is unclear how closely a prospective series would follow Faber's plot about a preacher teaching aliens about Christianity. The pilot premiered on Amazon Video on 17 March 2017; future episodes may be ordered depending on the popularity of the pilot. The pilot episode reached an average rating of 4.8/5 by Amazon Video users in December 2017. The pilot was written by Matt Charman (Oscar-nominated for Bridge of Spies) and directed by Kevin Macdonald. Plot In London, in 2032, society and public order have largely collapsed and there is a shortage of food and supplies. After the death of his wife Bea, chaplain Peter Leigh is contacted by USIC executive Vivian Hades and shown a video call by David Morgan, USIC co-owner and founder of the colony on the desert-like exoplanet, begging Peter to come to the colony. Peter travels to the colony and is initially received with scepticism by the crew as nobody had expected a chaplain to arrive, and there are doubts how a chaplain could be useful. Peter learns that there have been several lethal accidents that are believed to have been caused by hallucinations the colony members are experiencing, and that David Morgan has not returned from an exploration tour into the desert and is missing for several days. While Sara Keller goes jogging in the desert on one of the following mornings, she has a vision of her daughter (who actually is staying back on Earth) calling out for her mother in the dunes. Following this vision, Sara discovers the rover that had been used by David Morgan on his excursion, half sunk in the sand, with blood- stained wind shield. In the colony, Paul Halloran tells Peter about his racing horse that came to death on Halloran's wrongdoing, which he deeply regrets. Sara Keller insists that a search party should be formed to seek David Morgan, but Danesh, the colony's boss, refuses. The next day, while drilling for underground water, Paul Halloran experiences a vision of his dead horse, and attempting to reach for it, he steps into the operating drilling gear and is fatally wounded. The colony's crew and their leader, Danesh, conclude that the visions are not randomly caused by the environmental conditions but are some form of attack on the crew. Danesh invokes a state of alert and, with David Morgan missing, assumes the controlling position of the colony. Peter discovers a secret message in David Morgan's room and location coordinates. He takes a rover to go into the desert to the coordinate spot. He is stopped by Sara Keller, but she decides, apparently against Danesh's orders, to let Peter go and find out what happened to David Morgan. Peter ends up in a cave where he experiences an appearance of his deceased wife Bea.

Reception The pilot received a positive review from Beth Elderkin in io9 who complimented MacDonald's direction and Madden's acting, but criticised that the other characters were poorly developed. Andrew Liptak wrote for The Verge that the show might become \\"a compelling, thought-provoking story\\" with themes similar to those of Stanis≈Çaw Lem's novel Solaris (wherein a psychologist travels to a space station orbiting an exoplanet as some crew members call out for help after inexplicable events) and the short-lived 2011 BBC drama Outcasts (about strange things happening on a colonized distant planet).

He is known as one of the significant artists of newly founded East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in the 1950s and studied at the Art College (currently known as the Institute of Fine Art, Dhaka University) along with other pioneers from that time including Murtaja Baseer, Rashid Chowdhury, Qayyum Chowdhury, Humayun Kabir, Zunabul Islam, Ekramul Huq, Emdad Hossain and others. His art-style is considered to be very versatile due to his usage and practice using three different mediums: sculpting, painting, and printmaking. Early life and education Abdur Razzaque was born at Shariatpur district and spent early years of his life in Faridpur. He passed his matriculation exam from Faridpur High School, passed his higher secondary examination in Science group from Rajendra College of Faridpur with a second division and later in 1949 he was admitted into the Government Institute of Arts, thus shifting from Faridpur to Dhaka city. In 1954 he graduated from Institute of Arts with a first class and served as an artist-cum-Museum Curator, in Malaria Research Institute of Dhaka for a year. A Fulbright Scholarship was offered to him by the State University of Iowa, in Fine Arts for post-graduate studies. Later the same university offered him an International Scholarship and Research Assistantship in the same field. Abdur Razzaq is known to be the first Bangladeshi who received a postgraduate degree in fine arts from abroad. Career After completing his studies at the US, he returned to Dhaka and joined as an appointed teacher at Government Institute of Arts. He established a Sculpture Department in the East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (former Government Institute of Arts) in 1963 and later became the principal of this institution in 1983. He spent a big portion of his lifetime at the Institute of Fine Arts in Dhaka University by either teaching there or being a regular part of the administration. At first, he became the Director in charge of the institution, after few years took up the position of an appointed professor, retired in 1993 but was reappointed with a 5-year arrangement under a new law added by University Of Dhaka. In 1998 he went to full retirement but after that, he worked as a part-time teacher at Institute of Fine Arts from 1998‚Äì2002. Major exhibitions Among his 8 solo shows 5 shows in Bangladesh and USA are considered to be major exhibitions. Though he participated in more than 75 public group shows, 30 shows in Bangladesh, Germany, USA, UK, Poland, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, Norway, Sri Lanka, India and Brazil, including participation in the Contemporary Art of Bangladesh Shows in Malaysia and GDR, Hong Kong, Japan, Triennale India and Asian art Biennale Bangladesh are considered as his major exhibitions. Art style Abdur Razzaque preferred mixed medium more than the others. But his mastery was equally exhibited through watercolor, etching, engraving, oil painting etc. Even though he started out as a painter, he later focused on sculpting and was the first to turn to this medium after the War of Liberation. He used different elements like steel, wood, cement, stone, iron, bronze etc.in the making of his sculptures. Abstract expressionism was his preferred method to communicate with the spectators of his creation. He always wanted to portray the truthful aspect of nature, only by painting them in greater form than the reality truly is, by using different vivid and vibrant colors to show exclusively the colors only but not the shapes in details.

The case was featured in a 2014 episode of the Investigation Discovery series A Crime to Remember and Deadly Women Background At the time of the murder, Lucille Miller was just a few months shy of 35 years old, married to dentist Dr. Gordon \\"Cork\\" Miller, a mother of three, and pregnant with their fourth child. The Millers were Seventh-day Adventists (SDA), and had met and married when they attended the SDA-owned Walla Walla College. The family had recently moved from Oregon to a new house at 8488 Bella Vista Drive in the then-unincorporated Alta Loma area of San Bernardino County, California due to Cork's stated desire to attend the medical college at the nearby SDA-owned Loma Linda University Medical Center so he could move from dentistry to general medicine. Their oldest child, Debra J. Miller recalled that her father wanted to be an airline pilot, but had reluctantly followed her grandfather into dentistry in order not to have college funding cut off. Cork had also showed signs of depression and suicidal behavior, including one incident where Lucille hid the keys to the couple's 1964 Volkswagen Beetle with Debra, and had been taking sedatives to help him sleep at night. Case history On October 7, 1964, Lucille Miller had poured Cork a glass of milk to settle his stomach, and discovered she needed to make a late night trip to the store to purchase milk so the children would have it for breakfast. Cork asked to come along. He was sleeping next to the passenger door, which she locked to ensure he didn't fall out. They went to an all-night Mayfair Market where she purchased the milk. At about 12:30 AM on October 8 on the way home, Lucille claimed, the Beetle had a tire blow out, causing the car to catch fire as she drove off Banyan Street above a lemon grove. She claimed she tried to break a window but the fire was too hot to reach in and unlock the door, and that she then used a big tree branch to try to move her husband out of the car, but he was fast asleep. She then went to get help on the deserted section of Banyan Street and finally found a house from where the police were notified.A Crime to Remember, Season 2 Episode 6, \\"Accident on Banyan St.\\", December 16, 2014. The initial evidence matched her story, until authorities more closely examined the skid marks, much shorter than they normally would be in a loss of control as Lucille reported. Also, they noticed an empty can of gasoline lying on the back seat sideways (while the charred milk cartons were still standing upright and not jostled by the sudden stop), that the car was still in low gear (unusual for a 35 MPH crash), and that the car had dug in (implying someone had tried to push the car the rest of the way over the embankment). She was arrested later that day and held pending charges. A complaint was filed October 13, and an indictment for first-degree murder was returned October 20. Further investigation led to the discovery of the $125,000 (some sources say $140,000) life insurance policy with the double indemnity clause for accidental death, their financial problems (just over $64,000 in debt, including the nearly $30,000 mortgage for the Bella Vista house), and an affair Lucille had with lawyer Arthwell Hayton, a widower father of three, one of them a friend of Debra. Debra said Hayton's wife, Elaine, had also died under mysterious circumstances. Trial, conviction and appeal When the case went to trial in January 1965, no woman (let alone a pregnant one) had ever been executed in California, and there was much media speculation if she would be the first woman to go to the gas chamber. (Nellie May Madison was the first California woman to be sentenced to death in 1934, but her sentence was reduced to life.) Except for articles about that year's Academy Awards nominations and Stan Laurel's death on February 23, no other story dominated LA-area headlines in early 1965 more than the Miller trial. Miller was convicted on March 5, 1965, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Her conviction was upheld on appeal to the California Supreme Court in 1966, and also by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1968 (with F. Lee Bailey as part of her legal team). After serving seven years of her sentence, she was paroled in 1972. Her attorneys, convinced of her absolute innocence, continued to appeal her conviction. Aftermath Joan Didion wrote a 1966 essay about the case, \\"Some Dreamers of the Golden Dream\\", which appeared originally in The Saturday Evening Post as \\"How Can I Tell Them There's Nothing Left\\" (a quote from Lucille Miller the morning of the fire); it was included in her 1968 book Slouching Towards Bethlehem. In addition to the trial, the essay contains details of the fire, the Hayton affair, and a brief biographical sketch of Lucille and Cork Miller. Didion would later meet Lucille Miller's daughter Debra in 1996. Debra, Guy and Ron Miller all married, but had no children. Debra and Ron both became teachers (Ron is also a writer), and Guy became a third-generation Miller dentist. Kimi Kai Miller, born in June 1965 during their mother's incarceration at California Institution for Women in Corona, CA, died at age 25 from lung cancer, leaving two children. Debra and Ron were two of the on-camera interviewees for the \\"Accident on Banyan St.\\" episode of A Crime to Remember which first aired on December 16, 2014 on Investigation Discovery. Arthwell Hayton married Wenche Berg, his children's governess. San Bernardino County never further investigated the death of Elaine Hayton, which had been ruled an accidental overdose of sedatives, despite the discovery of the affair between Lucille Miller and Arthwell Hayton and the fact both their spouses had high levels of sedatives when they died. Death Little has been revealed about Lucille Miller's post-parole life, except that the prison-educated stenographer and model prisoner had three job offers in Los Angeles upon her release from prison and that she planned to change her name. Lucille was also \\"hopelessly entangled\\" with her kids until her death on November 4, 1986, as Debra reported in a 2006 newspaper article she wrote about her mother's case.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. Description The eclipse was visible in much of South America except for Guyaranquil, New Granada (now in Ecuador) and around it and the southern tip, Florida (then also as Spanish Florida) and the Caribbean, the Atlantic, much of Africa except for the Ottoman lands of a part of Tunis including Philippeville (now Bizerte) and Carthage, Cyrenaica, Egypt and East Nubia as well as the Somali Peninsula and much of Spain and Portugal except for the Pyrenees. It was also visible in a small part of the Indian Ocean and hundreds of miles (or kilometers) offshore from Antarctica. It was part of solar saros 132. The umbral portion which was as far as 141 km (88 km) included the northern Amazon, Roraima, British Guiana (now Guyana), Surinam (then also Dutch Guyana) and French Guiana in South America, in Africa it was 85‚Äì95 miles (135‚Äì150 km) south of the island of Santiago in (Portuguese) Cape Verde, on the mainland, it included the Bijag√≥s Archipelago, Conakry, present- day Ivory Coast and Ghana, Angola, Great Zimbabwe (now Zimbabwe) and Mozambique, off the mainland, it included the southernmost tip of Madagascar. The greatest occurred just over a mile (2 km) west of Koulikoro in Tonkpi in present-day Ivory Coast at 7.8 N, 7.2 W at 12:19 UTC and lasted for over 4 minutes. The eclipse showed up to 50% obscuration in Santo Domingo (now in the Dominican Republic), Rio de Oro, the Tuareg lands, the fringes of Mali, Songhai, Bornu, Wadai (now part of Chad), Kivu, Uganda, the Kilimanjaro and the Serengeti regions (now part of Tanzania) and on the other side the edges of the Amazon, Tocantins and Recife in Brazil and the southernmost area of Africa. The eclipse started in South America with a bit of the Pacific Ocean around it and ended at sunset east of the Mascarene Islands (compromising R√©union and Mauritius). The subsolar marking was in Mali. In parts of the world, the eclipse was not seen in some areas in areas that had monsoon rains mainly within the rim areas.

Other events are held in Kaoshiung and Taichung. It was founded in 2014 by the Taiwanese LGBT activist Jay Lin, and is the only LGBTQ film festival in Taiwan. Other Chinese-language LGBT film festivals in the region, which also feature international LGBT films with Chinese subtitles, include Shanghai Queer Film Festival, Beijing Queer Film Festival, CINEMQ, ShanghaiPRIDE Film Festival and Hong Kong Lesbian & Gay Film Festival. Background Taiwan International Queer Film Festival (TIQFF) was established by its founder and Director, Jay Lin, in 2014. It is organized and hosted by the Taiwan International Media and Education Association (TIMEA). Lin says he believes there is a global trend in the production of LGBT-related films, and in a report he produced in March 2014, found that 17 of the top 20 TV shows in the United States have gay characters or gay actors. He says that he thinks this trend will carry over to Asian-produced shows, particularly those made in Taiwan. =Queermosa Awards= In 2016, Lin worked with TIQFF to establish a film award ceremony known as the Queermosa Awards. Queermosa also uses the comparative visibility of LGBT people on US television as an example for Taiwan to follow, and cites the US figure of 271 visible LGBT characters. Queermosa states that \\"We might not have 271 LGBT characters on TV yet, but we should cherish what we have accomplished...\\". It concludes by saying that it needs to provide motivation and support to \\"push the often invisible niche community into acceptance and equal representation\\". Lin made a video named 'We Are Everywhere', which features the difficulties he faced when he tried to come out to his parents. History TIQFF began in 2014, and is screened annually every fall. In its opening year, it screened 60 films from 30 countries. It featured speeches from several film producers and directors, and the Taiwan Queer Awards, including a two-day workshop for local filmmakers, focussed on improving distribution and the production of LGBT content that appeals to mainstream audiences. In its second year, it screened around 100 films and included workshops with LGBT film directors including Stanley Kwan, Arvin Chen and Zero Chou. In the same year, TIQFF helped to found the Queer Film Festival Alliance, with festival directors coming from several main cities across eastern Asia. In 2016, its third year, the official international LGBT film award of the Berlin International Film Festival, known as the Teddy Award, awarded prizes at the Festival in its venues in its three host cities, during the Festival's screening weeks in October, November and December. The film festival has emanated from pressure for gay rights in Taiwan, which were part of the political and cultural democracy movements which started in Taiwan in the 1990s and began to grow. TIQFF's view is that while LGBT events such as Taiwan's Gay Pride Parade in the early 2000s increased LGBT visibility, and were part of several \\"localized successes\\", LGBT people in Taiwan at that time still lacked a \\"central voice\\". It believes that this voice can reach out to other citizens, the government and the wider world, and that \\"the power of films and media can help to create this bond\\".

It has a single erect, sparsely hairy leaf and a single white flower with a greenish back. Description Caladenia sylvicola is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which grows as single plants or in small, loose groups. It has a single erect, sparsely hairy, dark green leaf, 100‚Äì150 mm long and 1.5-2.0 mm wide. A single flower 14‚Äì18 mm long and 17‚Äì22 mm wide is borne on a stalk 100‚Äì160 mm tall. The flowers are white with greenish backs. The dorsal sepal is 9‚Äì11 mm long, about 2 mm wide and erect or curved forward. The lateral sepals and petals have about the same dimensions as the dorsal sepal but spread forward fan- like, in front of the flower. The labellum is 5‚Äì7 mm long, 6‚Äì7 mm wide and white with an orange to yellow tip. The sides of the labellum have lobes which are erect and partly enclose the column and the front part of the labellum has three to five teeth up to 1 mm long on each side and decreasing in length towards the tip. The tip of the labellum is curved downward and there are two rows of calli up to 1mm long, some with orange tips, along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from October to November. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia sylvicola was first described in 1998 by David Jones from a specimen collected in Hobart and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (sylvicola) is derived from Latin word meaning \\"forest\\" and the \\"dweller\\" referring to the preferred habitat of this species. Distribution and habitat Forest fingers is only known from two sites near Hobart, growing in open forest in leaf litter or near dense shrubs. The total population was estimated in 1997 to be twenty mature plants, but following a fire no further plants were seen for several years. A single specimen was seen in 2009. Conservation Caladenia sylvicola is classified as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act and \\"endangered' under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. The main threats to the species are land clearing and habitat fragmentation, inappropriate fire regimes and accidental trampling.

Street currently resides in Maui, Hawaii with his wife Johanna, and their daughter Shanti.  Artwork =Style= Street combines abstraction, impressionism, and realism into his works on canvas. His multimedia works notably evoke feelings of energy, warmth, sensuality, power, and beauty, and revolve around mostly spiritual themes. Street also employs heavy layering in many of his abstract paintings. Maui art critic Paul Janes- Brown has this to say about Street‚Äôs work: \\"You have to actually come and see the work to appreciate how great an artist this man is‚Ä¶The excitement of his work is extraordinary. The texture of the work transforms it to another place completely.\\" =Process= Street has been known to be most interested in creating artworks which carry great significance for their owners. ‚ÄúMy goal is always to create something for [my clients] personally‚Ä¶The art must invoke their inner feelings. Otherwise, it is meaningless.‚Äù Commissions make up a majority of Street‚Äôs work, and are viewed as a co-creative process. He begins with a lengthy personal interview process in order to uncover the client‚Äôs values and challenges.‚ÄúWhat comes out is usually some form of love and exhilaration,‚Äù he says. He listens to recordings of the interviews while creating the personalized pieces. This process takes six months or more, as the goal is to deliver a piece that ‚Äúpersonally lends inspiration for living life to one‚Äôs highest aspirations.‚Äù Art for Peace In 1999, the United Nations installed Street‚Äôs ‚ÄúLift of Freedom‚Äù in their UNESCO board room in New York City. In 2001, Street created his sculpture ‚ÄúThe Heart of Peace‚Äù, after having been asked by Michael Nobel of the Nobel Foundation and Gene Maillard, former Executive Director of the GRAMMY Foundation, to create an emotionally evocative sculpture to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2005, the UN, along with the Global Security Institute, awarded Ted Turner the Alan Cranston Peace Award in honor of his $1 billion donation to the UN and other peace-promoting organizations. The UN commissioned Street to create a piece for Turner to commemorate the event. The resulting painting, ‚ÄúThe Gift‚Äù, was presented in an event hosted by the Global Security Institute at the UN Headquarters in New York. In 2016, Street's sculpture The Agent of Change was used as the basis for UN Women's first annual Agent of Change Award. Collectors Street‚Äôs paintings are in the private collections of The Right Honourable Kim Campbell, His Highness the Sultan of Brunei, Andre Agassi, Wayne Gretzky, Trevor Linden, Sir Richard Branson, Eckhart Tolle, and Dame Jane Goodall. His work is in the corporate and institutional collections of Nike, Seagram, Virgin Atlantic, Federal Express, The Royal Bank of Canada, and the United Nations.

The complex is made up of over 50 buildings. These include a three-winged residential building with an attached chapel, four pavilions separated by a road, some smaller utility buildings, and a garden. It is noted for its fine Roccoco decoration and in particular its entrance staircase, which is regarded as one of the finest examples of its kind in any Baroque palace. The palace was built in the first half of the 18th century by Damian Hugo Philipp von Sch√∂nborn, Prince-Bishop of Speyer. Sch√∂nborn drew on family connections to recruit building staff and experts in the Baroque style, most notably Balthasar Neumann. Although intended to be the permanent residence of the Prince-Bishops, they occupied it for less than a century. On 1 March 1945, only two months before the end of the Second World War, much of the palace was destroyed in an American air raid directed against nearby railway installations. It has since been completely rebuilt in a restoration project that lasted until 1996. The interiors have been partly restored and the palace now houses two museums. History The Udenheim residence and castle at Philippsburg, 1590 For much of its existence, and that of the Holy Roman Empire, the city of Speyer was both an Imperial city and the seat of a Prince-Bishopric. The two entities quarreled throughout their own existences, but especially during the Reformation. As in some other German Bishopric seats, this conflict would force the Prince-Bishop to vacate the city. The secondary residence of the Prince-Bishops was the fortress of Udenheim, purchased by Prince-Bishop in 1316. Prince-Bishop Philipp Christoph von S√∂tern renamed that residence to the Philippsburg and began fortifying it in 1617 following the formation of the Protestant Union. In response, and with permission from the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick V, Elector Palatinate and a force from the Palatinate, Speyer, and W√ºrttemberg destroyed Philippsburg in June 1618. During the Nine Years' War, French general Ez√©chiel du Mas, Comte de M√©lac attacked and destroyed the Philippsburg and then Speyer, on 1 June 1689, razing the city and the . Speyer's burghers were entirely unwilling to allow the reconstruction of ecclesiastical property and even violently prevented it in 1716. Prince-Bishop moved his seat to Bruchsal and rebuilt a family residence located there. Rollingen's coadjutor bishop, Damian Hugo Philipp von Sch√∂nborn, and then Prince-Bishop with the former's death in 1719, desired to rebuild the Episcopal Palace in Speyer. Damian Hugo was refused by the city, though by then he was taken by Bruchsal's landscape and decided to build a new palace north of the town's walls. He wrote to his uncle, Lothar Franz von Sch√∂nborn, Elector of Mainz, to request the services of his court architect, Maximilian von Welsch. The request was approved, and Welsch set to work with Friedrich Karl von Sch√∂nborn, the Prince-Bishop's brother. Welsch presented his plans to Damian Hugo in September 1720, while he was visiting his uncle's court at to review the plans. Impressed, the Prince-Bishop approved the start of construction and in 1721 recruited Johann Georg Seitz, a foreman working for another Sch√∂nborn. The palace's cornerstone was laid on the north side of the cour d'honneur in what was to be the Chamber Wing (Kammerfl√ºgel) in 1722. =Construction= The north orangery, built by Johann Rohrer in 1725 The Chamber Wing's foundations were finished by 1723, by which time the stables and roadside pavilions were completed. After two years of work, however, Seitz departed for his original workplace, Wiesentheid. Damian Hugo fought to keep Seitz until June of that year, when he relented and hired . Rohrer was a master mason from Rastatt, employed at the court of Sibylla Augusta of Baden-Baden, who was not only in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer, but also a personal friend. Over 1724, Rohrer built the complex's orangeries and the gallery connecting the corps de logis to the Church Wing, itself completed in 1725. The Prince-Bishop moved into the Chamber Wing the next year and would remain there until the beletage was finished in 1730. The final plan for the corps de logis was only drawn up in 1725 by Rohrer and Welsch, with some input by the latter's young student, Anselm Franz von Ritter zu Groenesteyn. Over that year, Groenesteyn replaced Rohrer as the primary architect and constructed the corps de logiss first floor. Damian Hugo, however, realized that with the existing plan he would not have room for his dressing rooms nor for servants' quarters. In 1726, while Groenesteyn was absent from court, the Prince-Bishop had a mezzanine floor constructed between the designed first and second floors. This addition made Groenesteyn's plan for the staircase impossible and, when he could not devise a new plan, he resigned. He was soon followed by Rohrer, who had fallen ill and out of Damian Hugo's favor in 1727, and Antonio Gresta, charged with painting the Hofkirche's frescoes, who also grew sick in 1727 and died soon thereafter. Construction of the rest of the palace continued according to Rohrer's plans, but under the direction of an architect named Johann Georg Stahl, previously a master carpenter. Damian Hugo complained to Lothar Franz von Sch√∂nborn of the situation. In Lothar Franz's employ was an architect named Balthasar Neumann, who had just completed an expansion of Schloss Wei√üenstein's gardens. Damian Hugo hired Neumann as his new master architect in 1728, but he couldn't actually take charge because of the ascension of Friedrich Karl von Sch√∂nborn to the Prince-Bishopric of W√ºrzburg and his employment at the W√ºrzburg Residence. Meanwhile, and again acting on a recommendation from Sibylla of Baden-Baden, Damian Hugo hired Italian painter Cosmas Damian Asam in May 1728 to replace Gresta. In October of that year, Asam requested leave to go home for the winter. In the seven weeks he had been at work, Asam changed Gresta's design on the assumption that those changes had been approved by Damian Hugo. This was in error. The Prince-Bishop, assuming Asam had not managed much in the time he had been at work, has surprised to see the opposite. Though initially angry, the Prince-Bishop forgave Asam as he was impressed with the painter's ability and rewarded his labor with a hunt. Another painter, , was not so lucky and was dismissed on 1732. When Neumann finally arrived at Bruchsal in March 1731, he was tasked first and foremost with designing a new staircase. He accomplished this in 1731‚Äì32, creating one of the world's most famous staircases. In July 1732, Damian Hugo hired to paint the exteriors of the other buildings of the palace complex with faux masonry. Marchini also painted the frescoes of the Entrada and the grotto behind it. From 1737 to 1743, Neumann and Stahl built the guardhouse, hunting office, arsenal, and the tower attached to the Hofkirche. The Hofkirche itself was finished in 1739. The corps de logis was completed in 1743, but Damian Hugo died that very same year. He was succeeded by , who found the Chamber Wing still unfinished. Neumann and Stahl, now being succeeded by his son Leonhard, continued to work at Bruchsal under Hutten. Hutten ordered the renovation of much of the corps de logis in the Rococo style beginning in 1751 and lasting to 1754. In 1751, Johannes Zick was hired by Hutten following a recommendation from Neumann, for whom Zick had worked at W√ºrzburg, to paint the dome above Neumann's staircase. Another employee of Neumann's, Johann Michael Feuchtmayer, was hired in 1752 to create the Rococo stuccowork Hutten desired. He and Zick worked together until 1756, for example producing the Marble Hall. Leopold, Maria Anna, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart visited Bruchsal Palace in July 1763 to begin a tour up the Rhine. Leopold wrote of the palace on 19 July, \\"The Residence of Bruchsal is worth seeing, its rooms being in the very best taste, not numerous, but so noble, indescribably charming and precious.\\" =Decline= An 1870 photograph of the palace interior As a result of the Coalition Wars, the Prince-Bishopric of Speyer and the neighboring Margraviate of Baden had been forced to cede their territory on the left bank of the Rhine to France. Per the Treaty of Campo Formio, Baden was to be compensated with new territory, and this was effected. Baden was given seven times the amount of land it had lost, at the expense of Austria of ecclesiastical states such as the Prince- Bishopric of Speyer. This concession was confirmed in February 1803 by the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, though Baden was soon raised to a Grand Duchy. Baden's ruler, Charles Frederick, summarily occupied Bruchsal and forced the departure of the last Prince-Bishop, Philipp Franz von Walderdorf. Charles Frederick dissolved the \\"Principality\\" of Speyer and removed much of Bruchsal Palace's furnishings to Karlsruhe, though he awarded Walderdorf a pension of 200,000 guilders and allowed him to reside at Bruchsal in the winters. When Charles Frederick died in 1806, Walderdorf shared Bruchsal with the Grand Duke's widow, Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt with her unmarried daughter, , who had been replaced at court by St√©phanie de Beauharnais. Amalie spent three to four months of every summer at the palace, time she spent in a constant monotony that she often took vacations to escape. Amalie's household at Bruchsal and its upkeep was at her own expense. The early 19th century traveler Charles Edward Dodd, who visited the palace around 1818, described its \\"deserted splendour\\" wherein \\"the gay ladies of [Princess Amalie's] court complain bitterly of its magnificent dreariness.\\" Two other contemporary visitors, Frederick William III of Prussia and the Russian empress Elizabeth Alexeievna, also noted the droll state of Bruchsal Palace. Bruchsal's citizenry adored Amalie, though, and mourned her death on 27 July 1832. Following Amalie von Baden's death, Bruchsal Palace was used for myriad purposes while it steadily deteriorated. In 1849, during the Baden Revolution, the ground floor of the corps de logis was used for a barrack and later a military hospital for Prussian soldiers. In 1869, two years before the palace vanished from guide books in Germany, the Grand Duchy of Baden's Ministry of the Interior made plans to move a Catholic seminary into the palace. A major renovation was planned to fit the school, but were short lived. A decade later in 1880, the court jeweler of the Landgrave of Hesse wrote to the Badener government on behalf of the Vicomte de Montfort, a Parisian aristocrat. The Vicomte desired to reside at the palace and renovate it, but his request was rejected. Beginning at this time, hundreds of high-quality photographs were made of the palace's interiors. A restoration of the palace grounds was carried out at Bruchsal from 1900 to 1909 under the direction of German art historian Fritz Hirsch. The Grand Duchy of Baden was dissolved on 9 November 1918 and was followed by Grand Duke Frederick II's abdication on 22 November. The beletage was opened to the public as a permanent exhibit of the palace's treasures in the 1920s. =Destruction and restoration= Ruins of Bruchsal Palace in 1945 In the closing days of the Second World War, the American Army Air Force bombed Bruchsal to disable its railway facilities. In one raid on 1 March 1945, the 379th Expeditionary Operations Group attacked and destroyed the city's marshaling yard. 80% of the city was destroyed, as was Bruchsal Palace, incinerated to just the staircase and some of the facade. Reconstruction, aided by the pictures taken in the late 19th century, began the next year with some of the minor buildings put back together to provide administrative offices and temporary housing. In 1947, work on the residential structure began in the Chamber Wing. The shell of the corps de logis was rebuilt from 1953 to 1956, though conversely the church wing was demolished in 1959. The palace was reopened on 28 February 1975, though reconstruction on the facades lasted two more years. The reconstitution of the palace's many frescoes continued until 1996. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Franco-German friendship, French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met at Bruchsal Palace on 12 November 1987. The 12th DiGA Garden Festival was held here from 25 to 27 May 2018. Architecture The corps de logis and the Chamber Wing Sometimes called the Damiansburg (Damian's Castle), after Damian Hugo von Sch√∂nborn, who built the palace with unconventional methods and purpose. Damian Hugo built the palace with careful financing and a reliance on local industry, which allowed him to maintain a positive annual income despite the cost of construction. Additionally, the palace was built of brick in response to the French destruction by fire of the . The exteriors of several of the palace complex's brick buildings are painted to appear to be made of masonry. The facades of the two wings off the corps de logis are defined by risalite, made up of a balcony atop a door, and are discriminated by pilasters that also form the buildings' corners. Despite Damian Hugo's love of the Viennese Baroque aesthetic and the work of Balthasar Neumann, Bruchsal Palace bears Westphalian and Dutch influence, thanks to Johann Conrad Schlaun. Damian Hugo began with a French-style plan in 1720, but changed his plans after the next year's Papal Conclave and incorporated Italian, Dutch, and English influences in addition. The interiors of Bruchsal Palace share many similarities with the W√ºrzburg Residence. The stucco ornamentation within, mostly of the Rococo style, is French-influenced. To save money, Damian Hugo used the same architects as at other Sch√∂nborn family projects. One of these was Balthasar Neumann, author of the W√ºrzburg Residence, the palace of Damian Hugo's brothers. Neumann worked at Bruchsal as chief architect from 1731 until his death in 1753. The frugal Damian Hugo was succeeded by Hutten, who brought pomp and chic to Bruchsal. He renovated the second floor in the Rococo style from 1751 to 1754. When Leopold Mozart visited in 1763, he described Bruchsal as being of \\"the very best taste\\". Damian Hugo personally knew virtually none of the artisans that worked at Bruchsal Palace and relied on recommendations from family and friends like Sibylla Augusta of Baden-Baden, the Margravine of Baden. Johann Rohrer, Cosmas Damian Asam, and Egid Quirin Asam were among the men recommended to Damian Hugo by the Margravine. From 1725 to his dismissal in 1727, Rohrer prepared 717 plans for Bruchsal Palace, 63 of which were for the Hofkirche alone. Neumann worked at Bruchsal on and off with Johann Georg Stahl from 1731 to his death in 1753. The chamber music hall, decorated in the Louis XVI style, represents an experiment in early Neoclassicism. Renovations in the 1970s revealed the original Baroque frescoes of the \\"leaf room\\" (Laubenzimmer). They are thought to have been painted by Marchini, as they resemble his work from Damian Hugo at Schloss Favorite in Rastatt in 1718. The design itself, wooden lattices interlaced with vines and birds, is an Italianate design that originated in the 16th and 17th centuries. The German art historian Cornelius Gurlitt extensively praised the artifice of Bruchsal Palace in his 1889 work History of the Baroque and Rococo Styles in Germany. =Ground floor= Forming the entrance to the palace is an entrance hall called the Intrada, containing a ceiling fresco of personifications of the seven virtues defeating the seven sins by , who was responsible for most of the paintings on the ground floor. Above the pillars are windowed galleries into the servant quarters, which were not in the plans of the palace and were forced by Damian Hugo Philipp von Sch√∂nborn in 1726 and forced a redesign of the staircase. Enclosed by Balthasar Neumann's grand staircase is the Grotto, dimly lit in imitation of a cave and decorated by Marchini with murals of plantlife, shells, and river deities beneath a ceiling fresco of a bird-filled sky. Marchini's work in the Grotto, although still reddened by fire, was restored after World War II but not in the neighboring Garden Hall, which survived the war but suffered water and frost damage. The ceiling fresco remains unrestored in a permanent exhibition of the palace's destruction in 1945. =Staircase= The base of the two arms of the palace staircase. Entered from the back of the Intrada and wrapping around the Grotto is the Staircase, built by Balthasar Neumann from 1731 to 1732. Anselm Franz von Ritter zu Groenesteyn's 1725 plan for the palace was ordinary, perhaps inspired by the Palazzo Carignano, but Prince-Bishop Damian Hugo added a mezzanine between the first and second floors to make room for his dressing rooms and quarters for his servant staff. In doing so, the designed staircase was now too short to reach the second floor and Groenesteyn could not amend the issue. In 1731, Balthasar Neumann set to work to fill the gap, drawing up a design for a spiral staircase ‚Äì a feature that had not been common in German architecture since the Middle Ages. Neumann also extended the upper landing to connect the beletages two state rooms and thereby formed an oval that was then wrapped with a pair of staircases. This staircase has, since its construction, been the object of much praise. Noted historian of art and architecture Nikolaus Pevsner held Bruchsal Palace, and especially its staircase, in high regard. Of the latter, he wrote in An Outline of European Architecture: =Second floor= A corner of Prince's Hall, reminiscent of the H√¥tel de Soubise Above the staircase is a massive fresco, covering the entire dome, painted by Johannes Zick in 1752. Zick's fresco documents and glorifies the construction projects of Prince-Bishops Damian Hugo von Sch√∂nborn and Franz Christoph von Hutten. Male figures in the fresco represent architecture and construction, while female figures represent painting and sculpture. To the left of von Hutten are thought to be the two foremen of the palace's construction, Johann Georg Stahl and his son, Johann Leonhard. The entrance to the second floor is a large chamber and dome at the top of the stairs decorated by artists who had previously worked at the W√ºrzburg Residence. Woodcarver created the paneling, Johann Michael Feuchtmayer produced the stucco, and Johannes Zick painted the frescoes. Zick's ceiling fresco depicts the history of the Bishops of Speyer, beginning with Jesse in the 4th century and ending with Damian Hugo and Hutten, who are portrayed as patrons of the arts and architecture. The Prince's Hall () is one of two ballrooms on the beletage; it is the southern of the two. The hall also functions as an ahnentafel, bearing portraits of the Prince-Bishops from to Wilderich of Walderdorf, the final Prince-Bishop. The other hall, to the north, is the Marble Hall. It features a massive ceiling fresco painted by Johannes Zick and his son Januarius. The stucco and fireplace and mirrors of the Prince's Hall are French in nature, resembling the interior of the H√¥tel de Soubise, but also Austria's St. Florian Monastery. The apartments on the south side of the main building were remodeled by Johann Michael Feuchtmayer for Hutten in the 1760s. Walderdorff lived in them from his abdication as Prince-Bishop in 1802 until his death. The southern state apartment opens with an antechamber containing some surviving examples of original Rococo stucco, furniture by Abraham Roentgen, and some of the oldest tapestries in the palace's collection. Next is the Prince-Bishop's audience chamber, also housing original furnishings removed from the palace in 1939. Among these items is a life-size portrait of Hutten painted by Johann Nikolaus Treu. Past the bedroom are the Watteau Cabinet, used as a wardrobe and destroyed during WWII, and the room of the Prince-Bishop's chamberlain. The private apartments of the last Prince-Bishop are comparatively modest compared to the other beletage enfilades. The most private rooms were marked by still life, landscape, or genre overdoor paintings, such as the still life overdoors in the dining hall. On display in the gallery room are a number of paintings and furnishings owned by the Prince-Bishop until their relocation in the 19th century. The last of this suite's rooms is the Blue Room, decorated in 1810 with blue silks for Frederica of Baden. The room houses two tapestries from Ovid's Metamorphoses, depicting Leda and Europa. The northern state apartment also starts with an antechamber attached to the Marble Hall, adorned with stucco reliefs of hunting and fishing. This room also houses the Groteskenfolge, a six-part tapestry series made from 1685 to 1717 by the Philippe Behagle manufactury in Beauvais. The succeeding room is similarly ornamented, but with musical instruments and an overdoor painting depicting the tale of Gaius Mucius Scaevola. The largest room in the suite is the throne room, decorated with more tapestries. In between the throne room and suite's bedroom is a chapel. Amalie von Baden had her apartment renovated in 1806 in the Empire style. Her antechamber contains four tapestries of exotic settings made by the Aubusson manufactory. Adjoining this is Amalie's audience room, containing more paintings from the original palace collection, and French-made furniture. Next is the Yellow Room, a living room containing more tapestries, made in Brussels between 1550 and 1575. The last room in Amalie's apartment is her bedroom, which furnished from 1810 to 1815 in high Empire style fashion. =Hofkirche= The Hofkirche in 1930 The Hofkirche is connected to the palace's left wing by a narrow hall. It was designed by Balthasar Neumann in 1740 and painted by Cosmas Damian Asam. Asam was appointed in 1728 following the sudden death of the painter previously contracted to create the fresco, Antonio Gresta. Despite some animosity from Damian Hugo toward him, Asam painted the ceiling with images of Saints Cosmas, Damian, and Hugh in light pastels, impressing the Prince-Bishop. The Hofkirche was destroyed in World War II and a new church was built in its place from 1960 to 1966, with work by Fritz Wotruba and HAP Grieshaber. Nine bronze statuettes of the Twelve Apostles, made in Augsburg around 1593, were recovered from the post-1945 wreckage of the Hofkirche and are today on display in the modern chapel. =North wing= The chamber music hall, Kammermusiksaal, was designed and decorated by for August Philip of Limburg Stirum in 1776. The room was originally two stories high, but a fake roof was put in place during G√ºnther's renovation. Its yellow walls are covered in vibrant early Neoclassical stucco of floral friezes and garlands of wind instruments. The Kammermusiksaal was the significant first room in the palace to be fully restored, being completed in 1955. Grounds and gardens Plan of Bruchsal Palace's grounds. The Ehrenhof is at the center of the map. In totality, there were 50 buildings on the grounds of Bruchsal Palace. The main palace area takes up . It is located at the center of the palace grounds. Attached to the main building are two wings for the palace chapel and the apartments of the Prince-Bishop's courtiers. Welsch's original plan for the complex, discovered in 2010 at the Austrian National Library in Vienna, where Friedrich Karl was based, was of a three-wing composition similar to a 1711 plan of Schloss Wei√üenstein by Johann Dientzenhofer. The original plan, with the exception of the corps de logis survived into the existing structure. It placed the palace complex on a right- angle to the road leading from Bruchsal's north-east gate, distant. That road, now called the Sch√∂nbornstrasse, would have separated two sets of four identical buildings. The palace gardens (Schlossgarten) lie along a north-west running avenue called the Schlossraum. The Schlossraum is lined with statuary produced in the 1750s by the workshop of Joachim G√ºnther depicting the classical elements and the four seasons, while an additional four \\"guardians\\" stand in the lower garden, near the pools. The garden itself was first laid out in 1723 and was then doubled in size in 1728. This was replaced in 1770 with an English landscape garden. A railroad track constructed in 1843 shortened the length from to just . In front of the chancellery (now the district courthouse) is the Amalienbrunnen, erected in 1911 and dedicated to Amalie von Baden. It stands in front of the . The grounds of Bruchsal Palace are occasionally used to host festivities such as an annual Christmas market (Weihnachtsmarkt) and festival, established in 2009. =Museums= The two main museums at Bruchsal Palace are the Deutsches Musikautomaten-Museum (German music machine museum), maintained by the , and the Municipal History Museum. The Deutsches Musikautomaten-Museum, founded in 1984, exhibits some 500 examples of German-made \\"automatic musical machines,\\" such as a self- playing replica of the RMS Titanic's organ, from the 17th to the 21st centuries on three floors of the palace. They are all displayed in a setting contemporary to their production, highlighting their place in society. Audio recordings of the collection's various pieces is available on the Baden State Museum's website. The Municipal Museum, on the third floor of the palace, traces the history of Bruchsal from the Neolithic to the modern day. Focal points are the history of the penal system in the city and Bruchsal's destruction in the Second World War. Built, Destroyed, Resurrected (Gebaut, Zerst√∂rt, Wiedererstanden) is a permanent exhibit documenting the destruction of Bruchsal Palace on 1 March 1945. It displays pieces of the pre-war palace and the black-and-white photographs used to reconstruct its interiors. The lapidary, in the basement of a southern connecting building, contains stone sculptures from the residential building and surrounding structures. Examples include coats of arms, puttis and dwarves, capitals, and balustrade pieces.

It produced the 1861 Newcastle Report and this led to the 1870 Elementary Education Act (Forster Act). Context In the 1850s, much of the schooling of the working-classes was still informal or semi- formal, it patchy geographically some was provided privately though most was organised through the workhouse schools, the Anglican National Schools and the non-conformist British Schools. The factory school envisaged by The Factory Act 1833 which had made it compulsory for mill-owners to provide prove apprentices were receiving an education, never materialised. Instead this was done by producing a certificate of attendance at schools elsewhere. Formal teaching was done using the Lancaster-Bell monitorial method where one qualified teacher would drill a class of up to 120 children, with the assistance of several senior boys or pupil teachers, who he would train up in class. Public provision for elementary education began with a grant of ¬£20,000 in 1833 in aid of school buildings, but had risen to ¬£724,000 by 1860. There was sectarian divide that even blocked the appointment of state school inspectors. In 1839 the government succeeded in establishing a Committee of the Privy Council on Education which appointed James Kay-Shuttleworth as secretary. He had attempted to reform teacher training through providing 4 teacher training colleges - though, as the pay for teachers remained at ¬£90pa many had left teaching to study for the church. By 1850 education had stagnated, and in the view of the Conservative (Anglican) politicians it was costing too much. The Commission The Newcastle Commission set up in 1859 was chaired by the Duke of Newcastle. Its aim was to ascertain whether public money was being well spent when given at grants to existing schools. The Findings It concluded that the system was working though not as efficiently as it could. It was disparaging on the operation of factory schools. It reported: \\"The number of children whose names ought (in summer 1858 in England and Wales) to have been on the school books, in order that all might receive some education, was 2,655,767. The number we found to be actually on the books was 2,535,462, thus leaving 120,305 children without any school instruction whatever.\\" They looked at the previous years data and found that 2,213,694 children of the poorer classes were in elementary day schools. But of this number: *573,536 were attending private schools, such as Dame schools where a woman provided child care facilities and a little reading, writing and arithmetic in her own home. These failed to give the children an education which would be serviceable to them in after-life. *The other 1,549,312 children were attending public elementary day schools belonging to the religious denominations (church schools), but all but 19.3% were under 12, so were in primary departments. Only 300,000 were receiving any form of extended education, which was believed to be essential. *As many as 786,202 attend for less than 100 days in the year and can therefore hardly receive a serviceable amount of education *A large proportion of the teaching was inefficiently done \\"Much, therefore, still remains to be done to bring up the state of elementary education in England and Wales to the degree of usefulness which we all regard as attainable and desirable\\" Payment by Results In general, it considered that the system of state aid had worked well, but that the objectives had been set too high for the majority of children who attended these schools. Results should be tested to ensure that schools were providing value for money. A recommendation was made that school funding should continue but be made up of two parts, a small per capita sum and a larger sum based on whether the child passed an annual test. This enabled Robert Lowe, the minister who spoke for the education department in the House of Commons, to establish the Revised Code in 1862 linking annual grants to pupil results.

The two initially planned for the band to be totally improvisation-based with an open lineup. After encouragement from members of their local music scene to become a band and tour, they decided to do so in order to play with Cock ESP, an extreme noise band from Minneapolis. Since, the pair have released eight full-length albums on a variety of international record labels including Load Records, Dio Drone, Bar La Muerte, and Supernatural Cat, among others. The origin of the band's name, OvO, stems from using a piece of the Italian word \\"nuovo\\", or new, which creates a palindrome. Decibel Magazine summarizes OvO's latest album, Creatura, as \\"making rhythmic, layered, sludgy noise\\" and a \\"David Lynch dance party\\". The duo has toured extensively across the world, playing over 1000 shows in varied locations including Europe, Asia, North America, and Mexico. Musical style Counting Swans and Diamanda Gal√°s as their biggest influences, Pedretti and Dorella are known for primitive industrial sounds and Pedretti's theatrically dark vocals. The band is set up in minimalist fashion, with only two members, one of whom plays a half drum kit. Stereogum's Doug Moore described the band's sound as, \\"music ‚Äì rhythmic noise, really ‚Äì that simmers with a flat-affect malice, owing equal debts to extreme metal, noise rock, industrial music, and dark electronica, \\" while Christian Eede of The Quietus recalled their music as being \\"punctuated by slamming, swampy drums, squalls of feedback and punchy guitar riffs, as well as Stefania Pedretti's no-holds-barred vocal.\\" OvO has also been compared to Joe Preston's solo project, Thrones, for its \\"equally ambitious exploration of heaviness beyond metal's sundry genres\\". Throughout their seventeen years (and counting) of touring, the band has played with an eclectic array of artists including Thurston Moore, A Hawk and a Hacksaw, Zu, Bastard Noise, Jim O'Rourke, The Murder Junkies, Lightning Bolt, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Estradasphere, Ludicra, and KK Null. Gear used is varied, including Stefania's utilization of Death By Audio distortion pedals and Digitech Digital Reverb, while Bruno noted the recent purchase of a Roland SPD-S drum pad as a staple of their evolved sound.

It was not until 1942 that Japan began full diplomatic relations between the two states, making Japan the first Asian country to do so, and not until 1958 that the Japanese mission to the Vatican in Rome was upgraded to an embassy. The decision was made by Emperor Showa during World War II, hoping that the Vatican could serve as a mediator for negotiations between Japan and the Allies. Their history goes back further than that, however, dating back to the arrival of Francis Xavier on Kyushu island in 1549 as a missionary. A delegation of four young Japanese envoys traveled with him back to Europe and paid a visit to several European leaders, including Pope Gregory XIII. They were greeted with celebration and brought Japan to the Vatican's attention. The expansion of Christianity in Japan continued for several decades until it was banned in the early 17th century, which remained in place until being lifted by Emperor Meiji in 1873 as part of his reforms. Nonetheless, the number of Catholics in Japan has always remained small, making up less than .5% of the population. Today, the Holy See and Japan are engaged in close cultural cooperation. The former maintains an apostolic nunciature (diplomatic mission) in Tokyo, while the latter has an embassy accredited to the Vatican in Rome. History =First contacts (1549‚Äì1873)= Japanese depiction of Francis Xavier, 17th century. Among the first Christian missionaries in Japan was Francis Xavier, who came there in August 1549 and converted some seven hundred Japanese on the island of Kyushu to Roman Catholicism, including a man known as Bernardo the Japanese, who became the first Japanese person to visit Europe. His mission was a success and by 1580 there were about 100,000 Christians in Japan, including the daimy≈ç (feudal lords) ≈åtomo S≈çrin and Arima Harunobu. The Jesuit missionary Alessandro Valignano later visited the country in 1579‚Äì82 and convinced Lord S≈çrin to send Japanese diplomats to Europe, including to the Pope, on behalf of the converted daimy≈ç. He agreed and selected four Japanese Christian teenage boys, who left from Nagasaki harbor aboard a Portuguese trading vessel on 20 February 1582. They finally arrived in Portugal on 11 August 1584, then went on a trip through the continent, meeting various nobles and clergy, including King Philip II of Spain. The young Japanese envoys were greeted throughout European cities with celebration, eventually meeting Pope Gregory XIII upon their arrival in Rome. However, Gregory died in April 1585, not long after their arrival, and they attended the coronation of Pope Sixtus V, who also treated them well. This delegation, becoming known as the Tensh≈ç embassy, was Japan's first diplomatic mission in Europe.O'Connell, Gerard (20 May 2016).

They left the port of Lisbon, where they had first arrived to Europe, in April 1586, after having spent eight years traveling abroad. Their journey through Europe left a significant impact, bringing the continent's attention to the East Asian country, especially the Vatican's. Likewise, the four Japanese Christians were greeted upon their return in Japan by many interested in learning about Europe, and met with daimy≈ç and imperial regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi in March 1591. They were initially unable to return due to complications regarding the status of Christian missionaries in Japan, staying in Macao for some time. In 1614 all Christian missionaries were ordered to leave Japan. This led to the beginning of a ban on Christianity in Japan for over two centuries, during which tens of thousands of Japanese Christians were executed.Sherwood, Harriet (25 November 2016). Martin Scorsese‚Äôs Silence to premiere at the Vatican. The Guardian. Retrieved 19 March 2017. =Return of Christianity to Japan (1873‚Äì1919)= It was not until 1873, during the era of westernization in Japan, that Emperor Meiji lifted the ban on Christianity, giving it religious freedom and allowing missionaries to enter the country. The Vatican recognized the underground activities during the last two centuries and canonized several executed Catholics as martyrs, although much of the missionary work after the lifting of the ban was done by Protestants. Nonetheless, in 1906 Pope Pius X authorized the Society of Jesus to organize establish a Catholic university in Japan, and three Jesuits did so in 1908, getting official approval from the Japanese Ministry of Education in 1913, thus creating the Sophia University as the country's first Catholic university. Discrimination against Christians continued in Japan, with many people viewing it as a \\"foreign religion\\", and by 1907 there were only 140,000 Christians in Japan (only 60,000 out of those were Catholic).Walker (2012), p. 376 The Holy See also began reaching out to the Japanese government during that time. It sent the American bishop William Henry O'Connell to Tokyo in 1905 as a special envoy to thank the Meiji emperor for protection of Catholics from persecution during the Russo‚ÄìJapanese War. Japan replied by sending its own envoy in 1907. During World War I, the Vatican sent its apostolic delegate to the Philippines, Joseph Petrelli, to deliver a personal greetings from the pontiff to the emperor of Japan.DuBois (2016), p. 197 =Beginning of diplomatic relations (1919‚Äì1958)= Ken Harada, Japan's first special minister to the Holy See. In 1919, Pietro Fumasoni Biondi was sent as the apostolic delegate from the Roman Catholic Church to Japan, beginning a new era in relations between that country and the Holy See. It was not until 1942 that full diplomatic relations between the two states were established, making Japan the first Asian country to have a legation to the Vatican. Emperor Showa established relations because the Vatican had significant moral authority in Western countries, gathered information from all over the world, and he believed that it could serve as mediator between Japan and the Allies. By that point in World War II, Japan had some 20 million Christians living on its territory (the largest group, 13 million, being in the occupied Philippines). This drew criticism against the Holy See from the United States and the United Kingdom, which claimed the move suggested that the Vatican approved of Japan's actions.Religion: The Vatican & Japan.

Despite these protests, the Vatican went ahead and established full relations with Japan, accepting the diplomat Ken Harada, who formerly worked at the Japanese embassy in Vichy France, as the first country's ambassador to the Holy See.

This was satisfied by an informal agreement with Japan that the pontiff's apostolic delegate in Beijing would visit Catholic missionaries in the Wang Jingwei regime's territory. In 1944 it was reported that Harada gave Pope Pius XII indications that Japan was ready to begin peace negotiations, though later Tokyo radio denied these claims.Associated Press (18 July 1944). \\"Pacific Attack\\".

Despite her trepidation, she meets with Dr. Cleary (Ed Asner), a psychologist, whose attempts to guide her though the process dredge up Tina's resistance and fear. After yet another brutal beating in the transgender community, she emerges as an outspoken advocate, a role that changes everything. When she joins a trans advocacy group, Tina gains courage and dignity, along with a secret admirer, Chris (Anthony Abdo), who works in the neighborhood bodega and longs for a different life as much as Tina does. Underlying this universal story of family, friends and community, is the theme of transphobia and the very real threat of violence toward women like Tina, especially trans woman of color.

In addition, Alves and Rotondo worked closely with advocates and health care professionals in order to authentically portray the steps involved in the transition process for transgender individuals. The Garden Left Behind was selected as one of ten films by IFP to be developed in their 2017 Narrative Lab project. In addition, the film has received support from organizations such as GLAAD, PFLAG, NALIP, New York Foundation for the Arts, New York Council for the Arts, The Film Society of Lincoln Center, Trans Filmmakers Project, and Jerome Foundation. =eBay My Film Campaign= While in pre- production, Alves and his team pioneered the use of eBay as a crowdfunding platform, where they raised more than $100,000. The unprecedented success experienced during this campaign revamped typical crowdfunding methods. The film became the first independent film to be funded substantially through donations and sales via eBay. =Casting= In the spring of 2016, newcomer Carlie Guevara was cast in the lead role of Tina. Guevara decided to audition after reading the script and feeling a close connection to the character. She recalls that the script's \\"powerful, intense and necessary\\" ending propelled her to audition for her first acting role. The Garden Left Behind cast transgender actors in all transgender roles as well as Latinx performers in all Latinx roles, and bilingual performers/native Spanish language-speakers in Spanish-speaking roles. =Filming= Principal photography began in New York City in September 2016. The production introduced more than 50 new transgender filmmakers to the industry, with representation behind and in front of the camera.  Release  left The Garden Left Behind premiered at SXSW on March 9, 2019, where it won the Audience Award. As a film in the Visions category, director Flavio Alves and team were selected for being \\"audacious, risk-taking artists in the new cinema landscape who demonstrate raw innovation and creativity.\\" Uncork'd Entertainment and Dark Star Pictures released the film in virtual theaters in North America on August 28, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was released on VOD on September 8, 2020. Following the North American release, the film will be released internationally by Hewes Pictures.  Reception  =Critical response= The Garden Left Behind opened to positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 95% approval rating, based on 56 reviews with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critics consensus states, \\"The Garden Left Behind draws on one immigrant's journey to offer graceful, thought-provoking commentary on timely sociopolitical themes.\\" It appeared on the website's List of 200 Best LGBTQ Films of All-Time, ranking #39. Caryn James of The Hollywood Reporter said \\"It's one thing to decide to make a movie about the struggles of the transgender community and violent attacks on it. But it's far harder to turn that message into a film as natural and graceful as The Garden Left Behind.\\" Randy Myers of The Mercury News said \\"The Garden Left Behind will break your heart; a film of utter grace, poignancy and deep understanding.\\" Nathaniel Rogers of The Film Experience said that the film is \\"a must-see festival hit\\", noting that \\"[Alves] risks alienating audiences... but he does so to stay true to the overall vision and aims of the movie.\\" Asher Luberto of The Playlist said the film is \\"genuinely moving‚Ä¶with a big message.\\" Allan Hunter of Screen Daily called the film \\"an assure, poignant first feature‚Ä¶ admirably unsentimental, sympathetically observed and warmly played.\\" Kristy Puchko of RogerEbert.com said that the film's finale is \\"haunting as it is humane, and makes for a film that's raw, challenging, and unforgettable.\\" =Controversy= The film, according to producers and director Flavio Alves, was initially met with resistance and rejected by some major LGBTQ film festivals, including Frameline in San Francisco and Inside Out in Toronto. In response, trans activists spoke out by writing emails and making calls, urging festival organizers to show the film, despite some concerns with the film's bold and occasionally jarring content. Many members of the community have continued to defend the film and its willingness to speak out about the issues of violence against the Trans community and specifically women of color, with violent assaults and murder on the rise in the current climate. The festivals that initially rejected the film reversed their decisions after hearing from the activists and the film was well received at their screenings. =Accolades= After winning the Audience Award at SXSW, The Garden Left Behind has received over 20 awards at festivals around the US and the world, including Jury Awards at the Nashville Film Festival, Woodstock Film Festival, and Heartland Film Festival. The QueerScope Film Festivals in Germany selected The Garden Left Behind as the recipient of the QueerScope Award for Best International Debut Feature Film at the 2019 Hamburg International Queer Film Festival. The film was invited to participate in the Film Independent Film Forum as a Case Study Video Keynote, moderated by Avril Speaks, producer of the film, Jinn (2018 film), to discuss the unique fundraising and press campaigns that propelled the project to success.

He was also the hereditary seneschal of the County of Champagne. He went on both the Third Crusade (1189‚Äì90) and the Fourth Crusade (1202‚Äì04), where he died. Geoffrey was the eldest son of Geoffrey IV of Joinville and H√©luis (Helvide), a daughter of Guy I of Dampierre. His maternal grandfather had gone on a crusade in 1125. In 1189, Geoffrey accompanied his father on the Third Crusade. He was praised in the Bible of Guyot de Provins: \\"Who was Geoffrey of Joinville? By Saint Giles, they do not have a better knight than him that side of the Punta del Faro.\\" His prowess was such that King Richard I of England, a leader of the Third Crusade, as a mark of favor gave him the right to marshall his family's arms with those of England. His father died in at the siege of Acre in August 1190. Geoffrey was present at the wedding of Count Theobald III and Blanche of Navarre in Chartres on 1 July 1199, where he signed Theobald's act granting a dower to Blanche. In the week after Theobald's death (24 May 1201), Geoffrey was at Sens when Blanche rendered homage to King Philip II for Champagne on behalf of the child she was bearing, the future Theobald IV. Following the death of Theobald, who had taken a vow to go on a crusade, Geoffrey of Joinville joined Geoffrey of Villehardouin, Matthew II of Montmorency and Simon IV of Montfort-l'Amaury approached Duke Odo III of Burgundy, asking him to fulfill Theobald's vow and lead a crusade. Odo refused, and Geoffrey was nominated to make the same request to Count Theobald I of Bar, who also refused. The arms borne by Geoffrey V of Joinville Later in 1201, in preparation for his own crusade, Geoffrey made gifts to the Abbey of Clairvaux, the church of Saint-Laurent in Joinville and the men of Watrign√©ville subject to the Abbey of Saint-Urbain, which was a neighbour of Joinville. In the last two of these donations, he makes explicit reference to his intention to go to Jerusalem and visit the Holy Sepulchre. His presence with the main crusader army, however, is unrecorded. Geoffrey of Villehardouin in his account make no mention of the lord of Joinville after the failed negotiation with the count of Bar. He does not name him as one of the crusaders who split from the main army at Piacenza and went to Syria via the ports of Apulia, although it is possible he did go this route. His younger brother Robert, lord of Sailly, who was in Champagne preparing for his crusade in 1201, joined the army of Walter III, Count of Brienne, but died in Apulia en route in 1203. Geoffrey did reach Syria. According to Alberic of Trois- Fontaines, \\"Geoffrey, the eldest born [son of Geoffrey IV], nicknamed Trullardus, a most famous knight, wearing the sign of the cross, crossed the sea and after many feats there he died.\\" Geoffrey died at Krak des Chevaliers in late 1203 or early 1204 and was buried in the chapel there. Since he had no children, he was succeeded by his younger brother, Simon. His shield hung in the chapel of Krak des Chevaliers alongside those of other crusaders until, fifty years later during the Seventh Crusade, probably in 1253‚Äì54, his nephew John retrieved his shield and brought it back to hang in the church of Saint- Laurent in Joinville. It was still hanging there as late as 1544, when it was stolen by some German mercenaries during the Italian War of 1542‚Äì46. The nickname Trullardus or Trouillart, is attested in the lengthy epitaph written in 1311 by Geoffrey's nephew John of Joinville for the tomb of his great- grandfather and Geoffrey's grandfather, Geoffrey III (died 1188), in Clairvaux. The epitaph contains a genealogy of the family, including \\"Joffroy Troulart, who was lord of Joinville\\". Its meaning is unknown, but was not terribly uncommon in Champagne, for several members of the Villehardouin family carried it. A legend dating at least to 1498 and current at the court of Duke Ren√© II of Lorraine states that he obtained his nickname from having killed a Genoese pirate with a trouille, perhaps a fishing spear.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an annulus (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. Description The eclipse was visible in a small part of Northeast Brazil including Recife, almost the whole of Africa with the exception of the southernmost area, southern Europe, and parts of Asia with much of the west of the Middle East, South India, Southeast Asia and less than half of its southeast islands as well as parts of the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the coast of New Holland, Australia. It was part of solar saros 131. The umbral portion was 93 km (58 mi) long and started over 30‚Äì40 miles (40‚Äì50 km) east of the island of Boa Vista, Cape Verde, it included northernmost Senegal with Sant-Louis, much of southern Agaouedj (now part of Mauritania), Mali (which had separate principalities at the time), such as Timbuktu and Gao, modern-day Niger, Wadai (now part of Chad), Darfur, areas that are now the South Sudan and Abyssinia what now comprises Ethiopia and Kenya and Somalia (then as Somaliland). The greatest occurred just over 2.5 miles (4 km) east of Lagbogol in present-day Wajir, Kenya at 1.3 N, 39.9 W at 9:13 UTC (12:13 local time) and lasted for over 3 minutes. The eclipse showed up to 50% obscuration in Morocco including Marrakesh, Ottoman Algiers (now Algeria), Libya, Egypt and Yemen, Nubia, near the tip of the Horn of Africa and the Chagos Archipelago, and on the other side west of Cape Verde, near the island of S√£o Tom√©, the Congo including Katanga, Malawi, modern day Mozambique and southcentral Madagascar. Areas that were in the rim of the eclipse included Cornwall, France (Normandy and Paris), Alsace, southern German states, most of Austria, Hungary, Transylvania, Ottoman Wallachia (now Romania), Turkey and Armenia, Persia, India (Orissa) and the middle of Siam (now Thailand) and on the other side Namacqualand (now Namibia) and Basutoland. The eclipse started in West Africa and Brazil and ended at sunset in Borneo, Java and the coast of western Australia. The subsolar marking was in Abyssinia (now in Kenya). In parts of the world, the eclipse was not seen in some areas in areas that had monsoon rains mainly within the rim areas. Weather conditions in some areas during the eclipse was unknown. The weather conditions for a part of western Europe including France was mainly cloudy and rainy. At the time, France was experiencing the French Revolution.

It is managed as part of the Jefferson National Forest. As part of the wilderness system, it helps to preserve a variety of natural life forms and contributes to a diversity of plant and animal gene pools. Over half of the ecosystems in the United States exist within designated wilderness.General Information: Wilderness.net - Kimberling Creek Wilderness - General Information, accessdate: March 20, 2017Wilderness.org: Why Wilderness?  Wilderness.org, accessdate: March 20, 2017 With no official trails, the area offers the true wilderness experience amongst old growth forests. While there are some possibilities for off-trail walking, most of the forest and terrain are difficult to access. The wilderness is part of the Kimberling Creek Cluster. Location and access Bastian, VirginiaThe area is about 3 miles west of Bastian, Virginia in Bland County in southwestern Virginia. Extending for about five miles along the slopes of Hogback Mountain, the wilderness is bounded on the north by Forest Service Road 640, a dirt road requiring a four- wheel drive vehicle.Trail Maps: Blacksburg, New River Valley [George Washington and Jefferson National Forests - Virginia - Trails Illustrated Maps - Trail Maps], accessdate: March 20, 2017 The south side of the wilderness can be reached from Va. 281; the north end is reached from Va 640. With a rugged and steep terrain, there is a level of personal risk as one leaves the edge of the wilderness and could become lost or injured in a life-threatening situation. Visitors will require a degree of outdoor skill to traverse the area. While there are no maintained trails, several bushwhacks and old roads offer a chance to enter the area: *North Fork, 3.6 miles, trailhead on Forest Service Road 640 *Ridgetop Trail, 1.2 miles, trailhead on Forest Service Road 640 *Sulphur Spring Trail, 1.6 miles, trailhead on Forest Service Road 281 *Trail to the Ridge, 1 mile, trailhead on Forest Service Road 281 Natural history Protected coves in the wilderness contain white oak, tulip poplar, Frazier magnolia and yellow birch, while ridges contain varieties of oak and hickory, and the whole forest has thickets of rhododendron covering the under- story. The wilderness has an abundance of old growth trees. Compared to western forests where old growth trees can be quite large, old growth trees in eastern forests are typically smaller and most readily identified by their scruffy appearance. Old growth forests can take more than 100 years to develop, then the forests will contain a variety of ages as younger trees are seeded and begin to compete with the older trees. The dense forests provide above-ground dens for black bear, and loose, flaking bark for good summer roosting spots for the endangered Indiana bat. The area was logged and frequently burned in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Topography The elevation rises from 2,282 feet on Kimberling Creek to 3,200 feet on Hogback Mountain. The center of the wilderness is drained by North Fork which begins on the summit of Hogback Mountain, is fed by many small streams, then flows out of the wilderness into Kimberling Creek. The south side of the wilderness is drained by Sulphur Spring Fork and the north by Wolfpen Branch. Kimberling Spring, on the wilderness boundary, feeds Sulphur Spring Fork.Virginia Wilderness Committee: Kimberling Creek Wilderness - Virginia Wilderness Committee, accessdate: March 20, 2017 Cultural history The area was heavily logged in the early 20th century.

She was the first woman to serve as an officer of the American Institute of Homeopathy. Early years and education Corresta Thisba Canfield was born in Chardon, Ohio in 1833. The Canfields, for meritorious service, received from the king of England, in 1350, a grant of land on the river Cam, in Yorkshire, and settled there. After occupying that grant for 300 years, they came to the United States, shortly after the arrival of the Plymouth Pilgrims, and were among the first settlers of New Haven, Connecticut. Canfield was descended from French Huguenots and New England Presbyterians. From her childhood, she was ambitious to be a physician. She entered the Chardon seminary at an early age. Career Canfield married Franklin Knapp on November 26, 1849, and had three children. After the birth of her last child, she taught school for several years. Widowed and without resources at the close of the American Civil War, in 1869, she entered the Woman's Homeopathic College of Cleveland, Ohio. With the help of a half-year's scholarship, Canfield finished the first college year. In the second year, she became an assistant of the president, Dr. Myra K. Merrick, in order to financially support herself in college. She was graduated with first honors in 1871, having served for some time as demonstrator of anatomy. During the following summer, she practiced in Fort Wayne, Indiana, earning enough to enable her to enter the Men's Homeopathic College of Cleveland, Ohio. While there, she was demonstrator of anatomy in the woman's department, and practiced enough, visiting patients mornings and evenings, to defray expenses. She attended all the lectures, passed through the whole curriculum and was graduated in 1872, third in the men's course, the faculty acknowledging that she was entitled to a prize, but would not establish a precedent by awarding it to a practicing physician. As a medical doctor, Canfield practiced in Cleveland for a few months, before she settled in Titusville, Pennsylvania. Having but US$15.00 capital, she borrowed enough to buy out a resident physician and was able to pay all her debts the first year. She remained there for nearly ten years. She next spent a year in traveling. In 1882, she settled in Chicago, where she has built up a large practice and served in public offices. She was also appointed and held the position of professor of anatomy, in the Woman's Medical College. She was a member of the board of censors of the American Institute of Homeopathy, having been elected for the second time. She was the first woman who served in that capacity. One was elected the previous year but was not allowed to serve on the board of censors. Three years before her admission, women were not permitted to join that society. After a time, seeing no other women actively represented in the society, she felt that, to enjoy its privileges, one should assume its duties. She, therefore, prepared a paper and read it before the institute. She served as president, vice-president, secretary and treasurer of the Woman's Medical Association of Chicago, vice-president of the Hahnemann Clinic for two years, and was appointed to the woman's committee for a homeopathic congress during the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. She died in Pittsburg, Kansas, in 1920.

Background thumb In the year 2001 the vial situation in La Paz Bolivia was critical, it began an excessive increase of the automotive fleet and the citizens didn¬¥t properly know nor exercised their rights and obligations on the streets. It was then that from the Autonomous Municipal Government from La Paz a Vial Plan was proposed, that looked to order and control the entry and transit of the cars in the city center and to disseminate an awareness campaign aimed at citizens on the main rules of road, like the proper use of the crosswalk or the zebra crossing. The vision of the municipal management was focused on working directly with the citizens, having in mind that the message of a mass campaign on the traditional mass media would be lost or blurred by the impersonal nature of these media. The idea was to generate a platform to connect with the people and to take the message in a more direct way, but it had to be creative and not invasive, so that the citizens wouldn‚Äôt feel questioned by their habits. The City Hall of La Paz had to reach them in a friendly and innovative way. The Program To develop the Vial Plan, a group young and creative people had the idea to show the zebra crossing, with a character that would represent a Zebra: a two pieces costume that emulates the animal. In a playful way they could make people notice that there is a space for them to exercise their rights as citizens and to walk safely through the streets. That‚Äôs how they realized that there was a great amount of citizens of La Paz that didn‚Äôt know there was a zebra crossing or what was it for. For this initiative they invited young people that worked polishing shoes or selling candies on the streets to play this curious character. This policy of focusing on people's needs and improving the citizen‚Äôs behavior, helped to see more clearly the phenomenon that was taking place on the streets. Citizens and drivers did not understand the work of these young people dressed as zebras and sometimes reacted violently. On the other hand, the zebras did not understand their role in the Vial Plan, only felt that they were people doing funny things on the streets. That is when the training process with the young volunteers that were part of the Zebra Program began in performing arts, body language, theater and alternative techniques of education. From this process, the character of the zebra and its role were born: Urban Educator. The young people understood their reason for being on the streets and began to create their own philosophy based on education with love and respect. The vision thereafter was to improve citizen habits by inspiring people to be their best version. One of the main lines of this program is to focus public policies on the welfare of citizens and to offer tools, spaces and projects to meet the emotional needs of people. The zebra has become synonymous to living in wellness and generating positive actions in the environment with gratitude, love and respect. The project has a double sense of benefit to the social and educational. Social, because it gives young people a space for personal growth and development, self-esteem and commitment to their city. And educational, because it offers a real alternative of citizen education based on respect for the other and understand the difference between public space and common space. Looking for harmonious coexistence. Finally the character is recognized for his educational work in the city and is rewarded by the love of the children who see in them an inspiring character and an example to follow. Milestones 2001 - Pilot experience accompanying the Vial Plan The project was born on November 19, 2001 with the figure of a Zebra on 4 legs to attract the attention of the citizens in La Paz, Bolivia. Starting with only 24 young people, the idea was to wear a costume of a zebra to draw attention and start the Vial Plan, making visible the strips of the zebra crossing with a character representing a zebra. 2002 - Organization schedules, places and equipment The support for the Vial Plan continued, placing the young people in their four-legged zebra costumes consecutively in schedules and places of the city center, but the citizens still didn‚Äôt notice the crosswalks. 2003 - Agreement with Arco Iris foundation, beginning of the concept of Urban Educators The reaction of the citizens, the media, the drivers and the stop agents themselves gave signs that something was happening: the idea was perceived and provoked different reactions, which at first were not very good. Gradually the perception of the citizens of La Paz started to improve, but more importantly, people began to understand that it was necessary to respect many things in the city. At this point, the Autonomous Municipal Government of La Paz made an agreement with the Arco Iris Foundation, which worked on the projects with vulnerable young people like the ‚ÄúHogar de Ni√±as Obrajes‚Äù, ‚ÄúCentro de Adolescentes Trabajadores‚Äù, ‚ÄúProyecto Casa de Paso‚Äù and ‚ÄúProyecto Trabajadores‚Äù, so that children who were part of these projects and were in the process of reinsertion could participate at the Zebras Program of La Paz. 2004 - Entrance to public schools with a message through theater; \\"Mateo and his zebra\\" and the zebra is a one-piece costume The zebras became known as Urban Educators and this allowed the program to go beyond the streets and teach in other spaces like the schools in the city of La Paz through the theatrical play called \\"Mateo and his zebra\\" that showed the changes that could be made through observing and reacting to the difficulties of the city. The 4-legged zebra became a friendlier character with an individual (two-legged) outfit that was also more appealing to the public. 2005 - Creation of the Directorate of Citizen Culture of the Municipality of La Paz, participation in the festive calendar with education An important aspect for the development of the Zebras Urban Educators Program was the decision in the Autonomous Municipal Government of La Paz, to carry out the management to create the new Citizen Culture Directorate, at the request of the citizens of La Paz who participated in the cultural dialogue workshops. The task of this Directorate was to develop citizenship education and to find ways to reach people to begin the change of attitudes, doing a work through the participation of the Zebra Project in the different activities of the festive calendar of La Paz. 2006 - Birth of the Donkey \\"Urban Educator\\" showing errors After achieving the development of a friendly image of the Zebra, his antagonist partner, the Donkey was created as an educator who teaches through play and irony. Its function is to show the errors so that people can react and correct them. 2007 - Democratization of the participation of the zebras contributing to self-evaluation Although the presence of the Zebra unleashed several reactions, it is important to note that it was difficult for citizens to recognize that their behavior had to be corrected in the streets and therefore sometimes had negative reactions to the character, so the Directorate of Citizen Culture proposed a new way of acting, relationships that were fractured and distanced began to feed into a relationship of fellowship. The young Urban Educators, began to express their messages from the cordiality, the respect and the love. In 2007 the Citizen Culture Strategy was created to work the themes: ‚ÄúLa Paz in Order‚Äù, ‚ÄúLa Paz Safe‚Äù, ‚ÄúLa Paz Clean and Healthy‚Äù and ‚ÄúLa Paz without Noise‚Äù. In 2011, because of the mega-slip, one more theme was added to the strategy ‚ÄúLa Paz Alert‚Äù that works the management and prevention of risks. In 2016 the last theme ‚ÄúLa Paz Happy‚Äù is created, which is transversal to the others. 2008 ‚Äì Creation of the Zebra Philosophy: putting yourself in other people‚Äôs places After the internal review, it was possible to receive proposals from all the young volunteers, pointing out important aspects and proposals for actions in the street. With simpler ways of reaching people, the Zebras broke away from the stall agent's attitude. The approach was that from the greeting begins everything and regain the \\"please and thank you\\" that was completely lost in everyday relationships. In this way the philosophy of the Zebra was born based on putting itself in other people‚Äôs places, to prohibit is not to educate and the most important values are consideration, responsibility and respect. 2009 - Change in the relationship between the Zebras and the people After verifying that the form was to observe, accompany, care and teach people, the project aimed at conquering the emotion of people to reflect on their attitudes and behaviors in order to change them. From that moment the Zebras adopted an educative function that was given by the sympathy that managed to wake the Zebra and the great confidence of all. The Zebra Urban Educator became a channel of communication between the citizens and the Municipal Autonomous Government of La Paz. 2010 - Expansion of the Zebras Program to Tarija, Bolivia In 2010 the Mayor of Tarija visited the city of La Paz and while passing through the center of La Paz he found a Zebra operating at the traffic lights of Cochabamba Street and Av. Mariscal Santa Cruz. After the experience, the Mayor of Tarija requested to the Municipal Autonomous Government of La Paz to export the Program with the same line to his city. This year the Zebras project started in the city of Tarija, Bolivia. 2011 -Expansion in macro districts of La Paz It was proposed the creation of macro-district teams to serve other sectors of the city and therefore to respond the demands beyond the Municipality. Requests for visits with zebras to educational units and other organizations were increasing year by year, due to the educational value of the character and the themes that he teaches. For this reason, teams of zebras for the sub-municipalities of four macro districts were formed: Max Paredes, Centro, Cotahuma and the L√≠der team, generating a greater space of opportunity for young people. 2012 - Zebra educator of children and expansion of the Program to the city of Sucre and creation of the Program of Happiness \\"Because children are the present that we must all protect,\\" was the message that began to spread through the Zebras Urban Educators Program, educating with values in the squares of the macrodistricts on Saturdays. In 2012 began the implementation of the \\"Zebra Week\\" which consisted of visiting educational units on Mondays, hospitals on Tuesdays, markets of the city on Wednesday, Thursdays youth spaces and Fridays nursing homes. 2013 - Formation of the Zebras Urban Educators Unit, support to the Municipal School Program of Citizen Culture and start of the communication campaign \\"Zeta\\" In 2013, the project grew into the Zebras Urban Educators Unit of the Citizen Culture Department, which is attached to the Municipal Autonomous Government of La Paz. The Presence of the Zebras increased in the educational units supporting the Municipal School Program of Citizen Culture that works on the themes of the Citizen Culture Strategy. On the other hand, in this year the ‚ÄúZeta Campaign‚Äù was launched, a miniseries that takes like main character a Zebra that seeks to raise awareness to the citizens of La Paz on the subject of management and prevention of risks - La Paz Alert and the other themes of Culture Citizen. The \\"Zebra Urban Educators Program\\" was registered and approved as intellectual property of the Municipal Autonomous Government of La Paz. 2014 - First Meeting of Urban Educators of Sister Cities and First International Congress of Happiness In November 2014 the first meeting of Cebras Urban Educators took place between the cities of La Paz, Tarija and Sucre, where workshops were held to review, strengthen and improve the actions of Urban Educators with the point of views of young people. 2015 - Zebras Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Municipality of La Paz and expansion of the program to El Alto In the year 2015 the Zebras were named Intangible Cultural Heritage of the Municipality of La Paz and above all a La Paz city icon, adopting as a task to strengthen the work for the development of a Citizen Culture with values. That year, the Zebras Urban Educators started to work in the city of El Alto. 2016 - 15 years of the Program and Prize to the Guangzhou International Award for Urban Innovation in China In 2016 the Zebras Urban Educators Program, which celebrated 15 years of action, won the Guangzhou International Award for Urban Innovation in China because of the ease of replicability of the project and its dual function: educational and social. On the other hand, they also took the title of the Most Voted City Online. 2017 - International zebras In 2017, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver presented the Zebras of La Paz highlighting the work they do in the streets and showing that everything is better with a Zebra, thus creating the hashtag #JustAddZebras that became a worldwide trend and a viral phenomenon, publicizing the Zebras Urban Educators Program internationally. In 2020, in collaboration with the United States Postal Service, Oliver released a sheet of stamps which included the zebras among other popular characters presented in the show.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoL8g0W9gAQ See also *Crossing guard References Category:La Paz Category:Road safety organizations ","title":"La Paz traffic zebras"},{"id":"53549744","text":"The input‚Äìprocess‚Äìoutput (IPO) model of teams provides a framework for conceptualizing teams that suggests that many factors influence a team's productivity and cohesiveness. It \\"provides a way to understand how teams perform, and how to maximize their performance\\". The IPO model of teams is a systems theory, as it rests on the assumption that a team is more than one-to- one relationships between variables, and more than the sum of its members. It suggests that there are interactions and feedback between many contributing factors. Inputs are the conditions that exist prior to group activity, whereas processes are the interactions among group members. Outputs are the results of group activity that are valued by the team or the organization.  Inputs  Inputs include any antecedent factors such as organizational context, task characteristics, and team composition that may influence the team itself, directly or indirectly. As written by Forsyth (2010), inputs can include individual-level factors, team-level factors, and environmental-level factors. * Individual-level factors: team members‚Äô personality traits, strengths, weaknesses, preferences, dislikes * Team-level factors: the resources the team has access to, how large the team is, how much time the team spends together, how close the team members are * Environmental factors: how the team works with other teams, whether the team is part of an organization  Processes  Processes are operations and activities that mediate the relationship between the input factors and the team's outcomes. Processes include group norms, as well as a group‚Äôs decision making process, level of communication, coordination, and cohesion. Specifically, processes can be things such as: * Steps taken to plan activities * Initiating actions * Monitoring resources * Monitoring progress * Maintenance of interpersonal relationships * Dealing with conflict * Members' sense of commitment to the team  Outputs  Outputs are the consequences of the team's actions or activities. Most often this refers to the team's tangible output ‚Äì what they made, achieved, or accomplished. Whether the team wins or loses, whether their product is of adequate quality, and whether they were successful in completing their goals efficiently are all questions of tangible outcome. Other outcomes are also important, such as changes in the team's cohesiveness, the degree to which the team learns to be prepared for future tasks, the uniqueness of the team‚Äôs solution, and whether it increases in efficiency through practice. Team outputs were also categorized as productivity/performance, member satisfaction, and innovation by Landy & Conte (2009).  Limitations  Although the IPO model of teams has proven to be useful, it is important to consider the limitations of this model as well. Forsyth (2010) outlined three limitations of the IPO model: # The IPO model is too simplistic and does not accurately account for all the complex interactions that influence how a team performs. # Some of the ‚Äúprocesses‚Äù are not actually processes, but rather characteristics of a team that develop and emerge as the team works together. They are not events that happen, but merely mediators of the input-output relationship. # The IPO model should consider that teamwork influences constitute a feedback loop in which reversal causal sequences are also possible. The outputs of a team‚Äôs actions can provide the input for their next action.

Prominently led by Abd al-Hamid Darwish, who was described as \\"one of the last remaining of the original Kurdish political activists\\", the PDPKS serves as the Syrian sister party of the Iraqi Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Known for its moderate and conciliatory politics, the party has sided at different times during the Syrian Civil War with the Syrian opposition, the Ba'athist government, the Kurdish National Council (of which it was a founding member), and the Democratic Union Party.  History  = Beginnings and politics under the Ba'athist government = The origins of the PDPKS lie with Abd al-Hamid Darwish, a long-time Kurdish politician and activist. Born in a rural village of the al-Darbasiyah Subdistrict, Darwish was the son of an agricultural landowner family and as student became an activist for Syrian Kurdish issues; because of that, he was arrested several times. In 1956/57, Darwish helped to found the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria (KDPS) and was part of the party's leading figures until the mid-1960s. By then, the KDPS had unofficially split into two ideological camps, with one following a more traditional, conservative Kurdish nationalism, while the other espoused a modernist, national ideology. The tensions between these camps resulted in several small factions breaking off from the party; Darwish himself was excluded from the KDPS over disagreements in 1963. The party finally broke apart in 1965, when it divided into the \\"Kurdish Democratic Party in Syria (Left Wing)\\" and the \\"Kurdish Democratic Party in Syria (Right Wing)\\", the latter being led by Abd al-Hamid Darwish. This year is now regarded has the de facto founding year of the PDPKS. Unlike the other KDPS factions, Darwish's party occupied a more moderate stance between radical Leftist and conservative views. The alliance with Jalal Talabani (pictured) decisively influenced the history of the PDPKS. Though the two KDPS main faction briefly reunited in 1970 under pressure by the Iraqi Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), Darwish and his followers soon broke off again and revived the KDPS (right wing). At the time, Darwish's party primarily included urban merchants, professionals, religious leaders and landowners. Internationally, the KDPS (right wing) aligned itself with the programmatically similar Iraqi KDP faction of Jalal Talabani. When Talabani announced in 1975 that he would break with the KDP and form his own party, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), Darwish believed that it would be only fitting if he likewise changed his party's name to distance himself from the KDP. As result, his faction adopted the name \\"Kurdish Democratic Progressive Party\\" (PDPKS) in 1976. Elements within the PDPKS disagreed with the pro-Talabani course of Darwish, however, and over the following years broke away from the PDPKS to form their own parties. These splinter groups included one pro-Barzani faction that readopted the KDPS name; another faction led by Aziz Dawei that also called itself \\"Kurdish Democratic Progressive Party\\", and finally Taher Sufuk's followers who formed the Kurdish National Democratic Party. Meanwhile, the main KDPS group (the one from which Darwish had broken away in 1970) came to be supported by the KDP. As the KDP and PUK grew into bitter rivals, the tensions between them negatively influenced the relationship between the PDPKS and the KDPS. The party later suffered from one more split, when a group broke away under the leadership of Faysal Yusuf and formed the \\"Kurdish Reform Movement\\". Despite this, the PDPKS and KDPS tried to work together again in 1980, when they as well as the Kurdish Left Party in Syria attempted to form an political coalition. The three parties even signed a coalition agreement, but the plan collapsed when the Kurdish Left Party split over internal disagreements. As the relations between the PDPKS and the KDPS stagnated in the 1980s, the former instead began to cooperate with other allies of the PUK, such as the PKK and the PDKI. The PDPKS would also develop good relations with the PKK-affiliated Democratic Union Party (PYD). Even though part of the opposition, the PDPKS wanted to avoid open confrontation with the Ba'athist dictatorship under Hafez al-Assad, instead trying to bring about a peaceful democratization through soft pressure on the government and participation in the elections. Darwish won a seat in the parliament during the elections in 1990, which were more free than usual. He lost his seat, however, when the elections again became more restrictive since 1994. In that year, the PDPKS participated in the foundation of the \\"Kurdish Democratic Alliance in Syria\\", which included Kurdish parties that preferred cautious negotiations with the government instead of aggression. The PDPKS' conciliatory stance changed upon the outbreak of the 2004 Qamishli riots, when the party became more hostile towards the government. Despite that, Darwish still criticized other Kurdish parties who he accused of inciting the rioting, while the PDPKS as whole called on the Kurds to \\"extinguish the sedition\\". Darwish also signed the Damascus Declaration in 2005 which criticized the Assad government. = Syrian Civil War and work in Rojava = YPG to defeat jihadists and allied Free Syrian Army forces during the Battle of Ras al-Ayn. After the civil uprising in Syria began in 2011, the PDPKS demanded a nationally inclusive conference to allow a transition of the country to democracy. This came not to pass, and when President Bashar al- Assad requested to meet with Darwish, he was turned down by the latter. As the conflict escalated into civil war, the PDPKS, KDPS, and PYD attempted to extend their influence in the Syrian Kurdish regions. Though the PDPKS joined the KDPS in founding the Kurdish National Council (KNC) in 2011, it also allied itself with the PYD. The latter move was partially motivated by the actions of the PUK which was supportive of the PYD att the time. The PDPKS ordered its members to join the PYD-led Asayish and YPG, as well as the Kurdish Front, which was originally formed as a Kurdish unit in the Free Syrian Army. Many fighters affiliated with the PDPKS fought in the Battle of Ras al-Ayn, and were killed by mujahideen and allied Free Syrian Army militants. The leader of the PDPKS party bureau Abdul Wahab Kassem, whose brother was one of the dead, commented that the \\"Free Syrian Army is not really free. In reality, it follows the Turkish policy, which wants to prevent Kurdish self-determination in Syria\\". On 12 June 2013, Adnan Sheikh Muhammad, a member of the PDPKS who was also a member of the Kurdish Front Brigade and a representative of the Kurdish Supreme Committee in the Raqqa civil council, was killed by a Syrian Air Force airstrike in Raqqa. Serious tensions emerged with the PYD, however, in the wake of an incident in Amuda on 27 June 2013, when YPG fighters killed six civilians. From then on, PDPKS members left the pro-PYD militias, and the party began to cooperate more closely with the KDPS, for example supporting the KNC's decision to join the (anti-PYD) National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces. The PDPKS also began to distance itself from the PUK, which was still friendly with the PYD but also politically weakened at the time. In late 2013, the PDPKS rejected the declaration of the autonomous region of Rojava by the PYD as \\"unilateral solution[] in isolation from the national forces\\", and claimed that the new canton system was completely controlled by the PYD-led TEV-DEM organization. Darwish represented the KNC during the Geneva II Conference on Syria in early 2014. In course of 2014 and early 2015, however, the old tensions between the PDPKS and the KDPS remerged. As result, the PDPKS eventually left the KNC on 3 July 2015, as the party's leadership accused the other factions within the coalition of working against them. In mid-2016, the PDPKS participated in protests against the rebel shelling of YPG-held Sheikh Maqsood as well as Turkish attacks on Nusaybin, and for the reconciliation of the KNC and PYD. Over time, the PDPKS became more hostile towards the KNC, and it again shifted closer to the PYD as well as the Syrian government. In January 2017, Darwish said that Bashar al-Assad was still the legitimate Syrian President, and lamented that Assad's government had a more positive position towards the Syrian Kurds than the Syrian opposition. The Asayish closed three offices of the PDPKS in Al-Hasakah Governorate in March 2017 on the basis that they were operated without a proper license, though opponents of the PYD saw the closure as political move. The PDPKS itself condemned the closure as \\"arbitrary\\"; after the party contacted the local authorities for licenses, the offices were allowed to reopen. Kurdish Voice of America report about the opening of a PDPKS office at Koban√Æ in 2019. When the Syrian National Coalition declared the YPG a terrorist group in July, Abd al-Hamid Darwish strongly rejected this move. According to him, although the YPG \\"undoubtedly made mistakes here and there\\", it had not carried out any ethnic cleansings and on the contrary \\"made great sacrifices\\" to protect Syrians of all ethnicities from ISIL. Furthermore, the PDPKS was among the Syrian Kurdish parties that condemned the Turkish airstrikes of April 2017 against PKK affiliates, including the YPG, in Syria and Iraq. Following the death of Jalal Talabani on 3 October 2017, hundreds of PDPKS members gathered in Qamishli to offer their condolences. A few weeks later, Abd al-Hamid Darwish took part in a meeting between the Syrian government, the YPG and several parties of the Syrian Democratic Council at the Russian Khmeimim airbase in Latakia Governorate. In January 2018, the PDPKS stated its opposition to the Turkish-led invasion of Afrin, and urged all involved parties to stop fighting. It left the Sochi peace talks of the same month to protest against the Russian support for the Turkish operation. Over the next two years, the PDPKS continued to call for dialogue between the different Kurdish parties of Syria. It supported a French initiative to facilitate a reapproachment between the PYD and the KDP, though these efforts failed. In contrast, the party regarded talks between the northeastern administration with the Syrian government of 2019 with scepticism. The party's members argued that the government had shown little readiness for compromise, and that the talks only involved PYD representatives, meaning that any result would exclude other parties such as the PDPKS and thus monopolize influence in the PYD's hands. The PDPKS' Women's Organization also appealed the United Nations, and relief agencies to send aid to those affected by widespread crop fires in northern and eastern Syria in 2019.  Ideology  PDPKS Secretary-General Abd al-Hamid Darwish, 2014 Since its foundation, the Kurdish Democratic Progressive Party has defined itself through its generally moderate ideological position, adopting both centre-left to centre-right politics, while leaning more to the former than the latter. When Abd al-Hamid Darwish was still in the KDPS, he espoused the modernist Kurdish nationalism as promoted by N√ªredin Zaza, thus belonging to the left camp of the KDPS. However, as the more conservative elements left the KDPS, and the whole party generally drifted left, Darwish found himself as head of the KDPS' right wing, which did not approve of the other party members' populist Marxist communism. Thus, when Darwish's faction seceded in 1965, it was essentially a centre-left group mostly composed of progressive members of the urban middle class and rural upper class. As result, the PDPKS is considered part of the \\"Kurdish Right\\", although some observers have also considered it socialist. Since its foundation, the PDPKS generally supports democracy, gender equality, and separation of religion and state. Just like its ideological position in general could be defined as moderate, the PDPKS' view on Kurdish nationalism and self-rule in Syria has for most its history been cautious. The party usually only called for the realization of the \\"cultural, political, and social rights\\" of Kurds (and minorities in general) in Syria instead of autonomy. In addition, the party avoided referring to Kurds as \\"national group\\". In hopes of preventing open conflict, the PDPKS generally maintained channels with the Syrian government, was critical of aggressive opposition parties, and denounced the PYD's attempts to establish Rojava as de facto autonomous region in 2013. Since then, however, the party has increasingly adopted a more staunch Kurdish nationalism, and was openly calling for Kurdish self-rule in Syria by 2017. In contrast to other Kurdish parties in Syria which tended to fracture, the PDPKS maintained relatively high cohesion under the long-time leadership of Abd al-Hamid Darwish.

The area covers the associated ridgeline and hillsides, from the eastern base of Loma Prieta, towards the west near the intersection with upper Little Uvas Road. The northern part faces the Mountain Home area, and the southern part overlaps with Uvas Canyon. The western half of the region lies within the Los Gatos Mountains zip code 95033, and the eastern half lies within the Morgan Hill zip code 95037. The telephone area codes are 408 and 669.  Geography  The Loma Chiquita ridge ranges from a peak of approximately near the base of Loma Prieta to above Little Uvas Valley. The ridge divides the upper Llagas and Uvas creek watersheds, which provide water to the Chesbro and Uvas reservoirs, respectively. Native vegetation consists of mixed conifer-oak woodland along the mountain ridge, to chaparral and coastal scrub along the slopes. The area has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate.  History  In Spanish, \\"Loma Chiquita\\" means \\"little ridge\\". The ridgeline is relatively flat and gently sloping along its five-mile descent into the Little Uvas Valley. Prior to the arrival of the Spaniards in the late-18th century, the area was inhabited by the Ohlone people. Shortly thereafter, Spanish (and later Mexican) governments began awarding large land tracts (\\"ranchos\\") for settlement and grazing. The area abuts the Rancho Soquel Augmentaci√≥n and Rancho Las Uvas lands granted in the mid-19th century. In the early 20th century, a few (unsuccessful) attempts were made to establish summer resorts in the area. However, a small population began staying year-round and has since grown into the present-day community. In 2015, the indie drama Maya Dardel was filmed on location in Loma Chiquita, along properties near the intersection with Casa Loma Road.Movie Maker review of Maya Dardel, November 2017 = Wildfires = As with most of the Santa Cruz Mountain region, wildfires periodically occur in the area.

The line ran from Lansing to Jonesville, then returned north from Jonesville to Albion and Eaton Rapids before closing the loop in Lansing. The NCMR had a short life as an independent company, becoming part of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway in 1871 and then consolidating with the New York Central Railroad in 1914. History On April 3, 1848, the state of Michigan enacted legislation chartering the St. Joseph Valley Railroad. Its charter permitted it to build a single or double track from St. Joseph, Michigan, southeast to Cassopolis, Michigan, and thence northeast, east, or southeast to any point in St. Joseph County, Michigan. The company had to commence work in five years, and finish its line within ten years, or forfeit its charter. The Michigan Southern Railroad was barred by its charter from constructing a line within from the Michigan-Indiana border. So the Michigan Southern purchased most of the stock of the St. Joseph Valley, which allowed that line to begin work. The St. Joseph Valley began work in White Pigeon, Michigan, and by 1852 had built a single-track line to Constantine, Michigan. It extended the line to Three Rivers, Michigan, in 1855. Having run out of money, the St. Joseph won an extension from the Michigan Legislature on March 15, 1861, giving it more time to finish the line to St. Joseph. It won a second deadline extension from the legislature on March 17, 1863. The entire line was standard gauge. On June 6, 1855, the Schoolcraft and Three Rivers Railroad was incorporated in the state of Michigan. Its charter allowed it to build a line from Three Rivers north to Schoolcraft, Michigan. Construction did not begin immediately, however. Instead, the company sought permission from the state legislature to purchase the stalled St. Joseph Valley Railroad. The legislature enacted a bill on March 18, 1865, authorizing the purchase. Work now began on building the standard-gauge line from Schoolcraft south. This line opened on May 3, 1867, and the Schoolcraft and Three Rivers merged with the St. Joseph Valley on August 14, 1869. On June 9, 1866, the Kalamazoo and Schoolcraft Railroad was incorporated in the state of Michigan. Its charter allowed it to build a line from Kalamazoo, Michigan, south to Schoolcraft. This standard-gauge line was completed on May 3, 1867. With the completion of the Schoolcraft and Three Rivers on the same date, the line now extended from Kalamazoo all the way south to White Pigeon and the Indiana border. The Kalamazoo and White Pigeon Railroad was formed on August 14, 1869, by the merger of the newly-enlarged St. Joseph Valley Railroad and the Kalamazoo and Schoolcraft Railroad. =Later ownership= On October 1, 1869, the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (LS&MS; which had formed from the amalgamation of the Michigan Southern and the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad on April 6, 1869) leased the K&WP; in perpetuity. The terms of the lease stipulated that the LS&MS; assume payment on the K&WP;'s debt and purchase its equipment at market value. The New York Central and Hudson River Railroad acquired a controlling majority of the LS&MS; in 1877. On April 29, 1914, the asset restructuring and refinancing of the New York Central and Hudson River led to the abolishment of all subsidiary corporations and their consolidation into the new New York Central Railroad. The K&WP; merged into the New York Central effective January 1, 1915. Post-K&WP; track ownership Now called the Kalamazoo Branch of the New York Central, passenger service ran on the White Piegon-to-Kalamazoo line until December 27, 1937. Subject to intense competition and dwindling passenger and freight traffic, the New York Central Railroad merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad on February 1, 1968, to create the Penn Central Transportation Company.; The merged company immediately began cost-cutting, but losses mounted. The Penn Central declared bankruptcy on June 21, 1970. The Penn Central continued to operate into 1974, until President Richard Nixon signed the Regional Rail Reorganization Act on January 2. Most (but not all) of the Penn Central's tracks were turned over to a new corporation, Conrail. The Penn Central continued to operate as a freight-only railroad, but reorganization efforts failed. In March 1976, Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act folded the remainder of the Penn Central into Conrail as well.; Conrail upgraded the of the Kalamazoo Branch between Elkhart, Indiana, and CP Park (a siding just south of Moorepark, Michigan) in the late 1970s. The unimproved track between CP Park and Kalamazoo was now named the Kalamazoo Secondary Branch. In 1997, Conrail was jointly purchased by CSX and the Norfolk Southern Railway. The Norfolk Southern (NS) ended up owning the Kalamazoo Branch and Kalamazoo Secondary Branch. The NS leased the Kalamazoo Branch and Kalamazoo Secondary Branch to the Grand Elk Railroad, a regional freight railway, in 2009.

He won the 2007 world championship for the now- defunct Championship Bull Riding (CBR) organization. Bolton also competed in the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) and Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). He placed fourth in the PBR World Finals in 2015. He performed as a stunt double for Scott Eastwood in the movie The Longest Ride, being the only one of four doubles who managed to make a virtually eight-second ride on the PBR top ranked bull Rango for an ending scene. His bull riding career was cut short by a neck injury sustained during a dismount from a bull he had just finished making an 8-second ride on at a PBR Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) event in January 2016. He sustained a break to his C-2 vertebra. Bolton was temporarily paralyzed, but made a full recovery. The parent company, IMG, of the PBR made an offer to contract him as a fashion model in May 2016. Bolton now works steadily as a fashion model. Early life Bolton was born on June 1, 1987, in Odessa, Texas. Bolton was raised on a ranch located between Odessa and Gardendale, Texas, where he learned to train horses and continues to help out. His parents are Toya and Sally Bolton. He has two brothers, Brody and Bridger. He also has two sisters, Brylee and Bliss. He received his education from Odessa College and Texas Tech University through bull riding scholarships. Bolton is a second generation cowboy. His family has owned their ranch since 1903. His father, Toya Bolton, was a professional rodeo cowboy for 15 years (20 years total) and helped train Bolton. Toya Bolton won the George Paul Memorial in his professional bull riding days in 1991. When Bolton weighed enough, he approached his father about riding a bull. His brother, Brody, is also a bull rider, but gave it up for some time to be a saddle bronc rider. Bolton joined the junior rodeo when he was 10 years old. Bolton now makes his home outside Dallas, Texas. Bolton won his first bull riding world title at age 20. Bull riding career = Championship Bull Riding = Bolton spent 14 years bull riding. Bolton competed on the CBR tour from 2005 through at least 2013, perhaps longer. He qualified for the CBR world championship finals five times, from 2007 through 2011. He won the World Championship in 2007. In 2011, he won the Las Vegas championship. In 2013, he won the Hobbs championship. In January 2007, Bolton won the Findlay Toyota World Championship Bull Riding World Champion title at the South Point Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. He is one of only three riders to cover all his bulls during that season's finals. Bolton made a qualified ride on Rafter Jack and scored 88.5 points on him in the second round. Combined with his 84-point ride on Black Mamba from Friday's first round, it qualified him for the championship round. Bolton then scored a very high score of 94.5 points on The Air Up There to win. The amount won on his three bulls pushed him to $54,100, which was more than any other rider. For his year end total he grossed the most earnings which is what made him the world champion title holder. In 2013, Bolton made his first appearance on that year's CBR season tour. He rode every bull he drew, winning a Hy O Silver buckle and a monetary prize. He rode his first bull Bring da Wood for 87.5 points. Next he rode Cash Daddy for a high score of 90 points in the semi-final round. In the finals, there were four men competing, with Bolton having the highest score going in. He rode his bull last for a high score of 91 points and brought in the Hobbs championship win. = Professional Bull Riders = Bolton competed on the PBR circuit from 2007 through 2016. Bolton competed in the Velocity Tour event at the Yakima Valley Sundome in Yakima Washington on February 14‚Äì15, 2015. In the championship round he won with a high 90.5 point ride. He accrued 80 points towards the world standings. Winning the Yakima event became his second Velocity Tour win in the 2015 season. In March 2015, Bolton came in fourth place at the Fresno, California, Invitational, a BFTS elite tour event. He got a qualified ride from two of his three bulls. He won the championship round with a high score of 88.25 on the bull LL Cool J, his best regular-season performance. In October 2015, Bolton came back from an injury to compete on the BFTS again. The event this time was the Cooper Tires Take the Money and Ride, presented by Jack Daniel's at the Tucson Convention Center in Tucson, Arizona. Bolton scored a qualified ride from the bull Painkiller of 87.75 points to win the first round. He accrued 100 points towards the world standings. Prior to this event, he missed six BFTS events after incurring a right clavicle fracture back in Biloxi, Mississippi, earlier in the year. He was 35th in the world standings before this event, but the round 1 victory here pushed him to 32nd and helped him qualify for the PBR World Finals. After the regular season ended, Bolton finished up in the PBR BFTS world standings on the bubble for the PBR World FInals at No. 34. The top 35 riders go to the world finals, so Bolton just made the cut. It was the first time he had gotten inside the top 35 of the world standings. Despite his previous injuries, he still managed to qualify for the finals, right inside the cut line. Bolton finished up in fourth place in the PBR World Finals at the Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, which concluded on Sunday, October 25, 2015. Bolton's 2015 season was his best to date. He climbed into the top 35 of the PBR World Standings. He finished the season at a career best of 28th in the world. In his rookie season on the BFTS, he set several career highs: 12 qualified rides, 37 attempted rides, a 32.43 percent riding average, and 5 top-ten finishes. He did sustain a sprained right MCL in round 5 of the finals, though, so potentially he might have placed higher or won. In Vegas he recorded his first BFTS 90+ point ride on the bull Walk Off which won him round 2 and $30,000. This ride is the third highest scored ride of the finals. His fourth-place finish at the finals is significant when his injuries and his absence from six events are taken into account. His final season standings at 28th place guaranteed him eight BFTS events in 2016. = The Longest Ride = In mid-2014, The Longest Ride (2015), a film adaption on the Nicholas Sparks' novel, started filming. The main character, Luke, is played by actor Scott Eastwood. Luke is an injured PBR bull rider making his way up the ranks of the Professional Bull Riders into the PBR's exclusive Built Ford Tough Series. He also struggles with his nemesis, a top-ranked bull named Rango. The PBR signed as technical advisor and produced all of the bull riding events. Four current BFTS bull riders acted as stunt doubles for Eastwood: Bonner Bolton, Josh Faircloth, Markus Mariluch and Billy Robinson. Eastwood's doubles had to ride a real, top-ranked PBR bull named Rango, who was also named Rango in the movie. To grasp the difficulty of making a qualified ride on him, by the time the now deceased bovine had finished his PBR career, in 75 total attempts, only 12 bull riders had gotten a qualified ride. On August 9, 2014, they were at the Lawrence Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where all four riders (Bolton last) attempted the bull to film a comeback scene where Luke attempts to ride Rango in one of the final scenes of the movie. Bolton recalled that it was an intense moment in his career: a qualified (eight-second) ride was required for filming, and the production was relying on success. Bolton's ride was just short of eight seconds but was sufficient for filming purposes. = Broken neck = On Sunday, January 10, 2016, on the final day of the season opener, the Chicago Invitational at the Allstate Arena, Bolton was leading the event. Prior to the final day of the event, Sunday, he was two for two on his previous bulls. Then Sunday, he rode the bull Cowboy Up for an 86.75-point ride. After completing the ride, Bolton mistimed his dismount, cartwheeled in mid-air, and landed on his head. Cowboy Up nearly stomped him but he was rescued by the bull fighters. Bolton was conscious, but had no feeling from his neck down. He was put on an ambulance and taken to Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, Illinois. Once there, doctors determined he broke his C-2 vertebra, but his spinal cord remained intact. On Tuesday, doctors operated on Bolton to fuse-spinal fusion- his C2 and C3 vertebrae, inserting into the bones a metal brace. By this time, Bolton had all the feeling and movement back in his body, but he was required to remain completely still for a month. He wore a neck collar for several months, but was still physically active once allowed to leave the hospital, helping a friend install flooring and taking long walks. He noted: \\"‚ÄúI‚Äôm told I may lose 10 to 15 percent of the movement in my neck. But that.s a diagnosis for the average patient. Not everyone‚Äôs as determined as I am.\\" The Rider Relief Fund and Cowboys Helping Cowboys assisted him financially during this crucial time. \\"I've received some unbelievable love and support,\\" Bolton observed. \\"We're all family in this sport. Everybody helps everybody else. That's the cowboy way.\\" While initially he was told he could get back to bull riding in 4‚Äì6 months, a few months later, Bolton's sports doctor told him, \\"The way they put the metal in your neck, it's right next to your main artery. If you break something against your third vertebra, you're dead or paralyzed. I will never release you to ride\\".  Fashion modeling  On April 15, 2015, WME/IMG, now known as Endeavor, signed an agreement to acquire the Professional Bull Riders (PBR). In 2015, photographer Cass Bird took portraits of the bull riders at the world championship and, on May 19, 2016, IMG Models noticed and signed Bolton to a global modeling contract. Since signing with IMG, he has posed for Saks Fifth Avenue and posed shirtless for a Br4ss underwear campaign. He also appeared in a print ad campaign for Boot Barn's County Chic apparel. In July 2017, American Eagle Outfitters named Bolton as one of the new faces of its new collection, \\"The New American Jean\\", to be shot by Cass Bird. Bolton is now \\"The Cosmo Guy\\" featured in the August issue of Cosmopolitan. Dancing with the Stars On March 1, 2017, Bolton was announced as one of the celebrity contestants to compete on the 24th season of Dancing with the Stars and was partnered with Sharna Burgess. On May 8, 2017, Bolton and Burgess were eliminated, coming in 5th place.

The attraction was designed by Disney Imagineer Rolly Crump as part of creating a ride that would complement Gypsy Camp, a former themed area of the park. However, the dwindling Gypsy Camp would end up becoming a new section called the Roaring 20s (now known as The Boardwalk). As a result, the design of Bear-y Tales was altered twice until it ended up reflecting the theme of the Roaring 20s area. During construction, the building caught on fire and a couple of scenes that were under development were destroyed. However, the attraction was given an extended deadline to allow more time and reconstruction of the damaged parts of the ride. In the fall of 1986, Knott's Bear-y Tales was closed to become Kingdom of the Dinosaurs due to the then-upcoming trend of dinosaurs. Following the closure, many of the animatronics and set pieces were obtained by employees, while others stayed within Knott's to become a part of a walk-through experience in 1987 located at the Camp Snoopy area. That attraction also closed and was removed in 1998. On November 7, 2019, Knott's announced that a new 4-D interactive attraction serving as a sequel to Knott's Bear-y Tales will replace Voyage to the Iron Reef for the 100th anniversary of the park, titled \\"Knott's Bear-y Tales: Return to the Fair\\".

In the background, the Sabine Mountains bordering the valley. The Rieti Valley or Rieti Plain ( or Conca Reatina) is a small plain in central Italy, where lies the city of Rieti, Lazio. It is also known as Sacred Valley and Holy Valley () since saint Francis of Assisi lived here for many years and erected four shrines, which have become the destination of pilgrims. It is the center of the Sabine region and an important part of the province of Rieti. Originated from the draining of the ancient Lake Velino, it is crossed by the Velino river and bordered by Monti Reatini and Sabine Mountains.  Origin  Plastic model on display at the Civic Museum of Rieti, showing the extent of ancient Velino Lake In prehistory the Rieti Valley was entirely occupied by a large lake which ancient Romans called Lake Velinus, since its tributary was the Velino river. The lake was formed during the quaternary, when limestone carried by water in the river deposited in the tight canyon where it flowed, shortly before joining the Nera river, near the present-day village of Marmore. As a result, the riverbed was occluded and the Rieti Plain was flooded becoming a lake. The water level in the lake rose and lowered several times during the centuries, favouring the formation of wide marshy zones around the lake where it was insalubrious to live because of malaria. For this reason in 271 BC (after the ancient Romans having defeated the Sabines and acquired control of the area), consul Manius Curius Dentatus decided to drain the lake by digging an artificial canal in the limestone rock at Marmore. This imposing engineering achievement created Cascata delle Marmore, a 165 m (541 feet) tall waterfall by means of which the Velino river could flow again into the Nera river, and allow the large and fertile valley to be farmed. Of the original great lake only some minor lakes remain, the largest being Lago di Piediluco. Cascata delle Marmore After the fall of the Roman Empire, lack of maintenance caused the canal to become obstructed again and in the Middle Ages the lake partially reformed. New draining interventions were ordered in 1545 by Pope Paul III; Antonio da Sangallo the Younger was charged to dig a new canal, but died of malaria in 1546 before the works were completed. Only in 1596 pope Clement VIII ordered new interventions, and Giovanni Fontana completed the new canal, ultimately draining the valley. Even if the lake disappeared, the recurring floods of the Velino river still caused trouble to farmers, disrupting their cultivations. This problem was solved in the Fascist era, when two large dams were built along the course of the two main tributaries of Velino (rivers Salto and Turano) to control their flow. As a result, the large artificial lakes Salto and Turano were formed (around 20 km SE from the Rieti plain).  Geography  Monte Terminillo as seen from the valley The Rieti Plain has a semi-circular shape and extends by around 90 km¬≤, ranging from 370 to 380 metres above sea level; it is long 14 km and wide in average 7 km. It is bordered all round by mountains: Sabine Mountains at west and south, monti Reatini at east (the highest peak being Monte Terminillo, 2,217 metres or 7,274 ft high, a popular skiing resort). Inside the plain two minor lakes can be found, residual of the ancient Lake Velinus: Lago Lungo and Lago di Ripasottile. This small wetland has preserved similar conditions to those present before the draining of the valley, and is a resting area to many migrating bird species; for this reason the area is now a nature reserve.  Agriculture  The Rieti Valley has always been known for its fertility, and it was sometimes nicknamed \\"the granary of Rome\\". Virgil wrote that, if a stick was planted in a field, it could not be seen anymore on the day after, due to the grass that had grown around it. In the 19th century wheat native to the Rieti Valley was famous all over Italy for being very productive and disease-resistant; agronomist Nazareno Strampelli used it as a starting point for his experiments, which led to the creation of wheat varieties that became popular all over the world in the mid-20th century. Other cultivations from the past were woad and sugar beet (which was refined at the Rieti sugar mill). Today the most important cultivations are corn, sunflowers and vegetables.  Tourism and pilgrimages  Cammino di Francesco sign In the course of his life, saint Francis of Assisi visited repeatedly the Rieti Valley: the first time probably in 1209, then a long stay in 1223 and then another from the autumn of 1225 to April 1226. While in the valley, Francis represented for the first time the nativity scene, wrote the final version of the Franciscan Rule and probably also the Canticle of the Sun, but most importantly he founded the four shrines that are located at the four borders of the plain: Sanctuary of Greccio, La Foresta, Poggio Bustone and Fonte Colombo. The stay of Saint Francis coincided with a period in which Rieti enjoyed economic prosperity and became often a papal seat, from Innocent III in 1198 to Boniface VIII in 1298. Today franciscan sanctuaries have become objects of pilgrimages; tourists and pilgrims walk a path known as the Cammino di Francesco, which links the shrines and other landmarks such as Rieti's medioeval city centre, the Abbey of Saint Pastor and the Lungo and Ripasottile Lakes natural reserve.

The song was released on March 1, 2016, as the lead single from the album. It was written by Mitski and produced by Patrick Hyland. \\"Your Best American Girl\\"'s instrumentation has been described as consisting of acoustic guitar strumming, dream pop synthesizers, and a grungy, distorted guitar. The song's lyrics are autobiographical, discussing Mitski's want for a relationship with someone, but accepting that her racial identity and upbringing obstruct her from this goal.  Background and release  \\"Your Best American Girl\\" was written by Mitski. It was produced and mastered by Patrick Hyland. The song was recorded in the now- defunct Acme Studios in Westchester, New York. \\"Your Best American Girl\\" was released on March 1, 2016, to digital retailers and label Dead Oceans' SoundCloud, where it was able to be streamed for free. It was also available as an instant gratification track for those who pre-ordered Puberty 2 on iTunes.  Composition  \\"Your Best American Girl\\" is an indie rock and punk rock song that is three minutes and thirty-two seconds long. Consequence of Sound has described the song as \\"start[ing] off as a sauntering acoustic indie number build[ing] until it breaks as a shining punk song\\"\\". The song's lyrics are autobiographical, discussing Mitski's want for a relationship with someone, but accepting that her racial identity and upbringing obstruct her from this goal. According to Pitchfork, the song \\"grows from an acoustic strum with some twinkling dream pop synths, to sharp bursts of feedback that would fit right in on Weezer's Pinkerton.\\" Katie Rife of A.V. Club likened the \\"crashing waves of guitars\\" present in the song to Pixies. Ciara Dolan of Consequence of Sound noted a possible continuation of Retired From Sad, New Career in Business's \\"Strawberry Blonde\\", calling \\"Your Best American Girl\\" \\"the [...] realization that [Mitski] can‚Äôt [...] change her own shape to fit into that of this all-American boy\\".  Critical reception  Mitski performing at St Jerome's Laneway Festival in Melbourne, Australia, in February 2019. \\"Your Best American Girl\\" was voted the fifth-best song of 2016 in The Village Voice's 44th annual Pazz & Jop critic's poll. Reviewing the song, Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork praised the song's empowering theme, believing it to be realistic and universal. Mapes also gave the song the \\"Best New Track\\" award. In a review of Puberty 2, Ciara Dolan of Consequence of Sound called the song one of the \\"Essential Tracks\\" from its parent album. Katie Rife of A.V. Club lauded the track, stating that it was a \\"a powerful assertion of cultural identity and self-acceptance\\". Writing for Stereogum, Tom Breihan called \\"Your Best American Girl\\" a \\"[moment] of great rock catharsis\\". Ryan E.C. Hamm of Under the Radar complimented the song's lyricism, guitars, and feedback, stating that the recording \\"[harks] back to the very best of alternative rock of the early '90s\\". Including the song on their \\"30 Best Songs of 2016 So Far\\" list, Rolling Stone stated that the song \\"tightrope [walked] the chasm between romantic ideals and cultural reality to make for breathtaking music\\". Several publications placed \\"Your Best American Girl\\" on their respective year-end singles lists. Ranking the song the second best of 2016, NPR wrote that the \\"song is brilliant for many reasons\\", but most notably because \\"[of] the way it forces us each to conjure up our 'all- American boy' and then take issue with the fact that coming up with a picture of him was so easy\\". Also ranking the song the second best of 2016, Paste described the song as an \\"angst-ridden anthem about an identity crisis\\". Rating the \\"Your Best American Girl\\" the sixteenth best song of the year, Pitchfork called the track was \\"universally resonant and personally specific\\". Multiple publications also placed \\"Your Best American Girl\\" on decade-end or all-time singles lists. NPR placed it 16th on their list of the 200 Greatest Songs By 21st Century Women+, and Billboard included it in their list of 100 Songs that Defined the 2010s. Pitchfork also listed it 7th on their list of the 200 Best Songs of the 2010s. From over 35 outlets, global critic aggregator Acclaimed Music went on to rank \\"Your Best American Girl\\" as the 9th greatest song of the 2010s.

The video features Mitski making out with her own hand while a stereotypically white American couple passionately kiss nearby. According to Mitski, the video \\"plays on the idea of, as a Japanese girl, never quite fitting in with the genre's surplus of white American guys.\\" Billboard has said of the video \\"if the arrangement played with male-centric tropes, the music video was more of an ode to women that came before her.\\" Cinematographer Ashley Connor has stated that the video intentionally references videos from artist PJ Harvey videos \\"the sort of ‚Äòwoman with guitar and nothing else in a white space.\\" Describing the production of the video, Connor has said the following: > ‚ÄúAnd at the end of the take, the entire crew, everybody just stopped and > clapped for her.

Initially commanded by General Max von Schenckendorff, it was an area of military jurisdiction behind Wehrmacht's Army Group Centre. The Group Centre Rear Area's outward function was to provide security behind the fighting troops. It was also a site of mass murder during The Holocaust and other crimes against humanity targeting the civilian population. In the words of historian Michael Parrish, the army commander \\"presided over an empire of terror and brutality\\". Organisation The commander of the Army Group Centre Rear Area, General Max von Schenckendorff, was responsible for the rear area security. Its headquarters was subordinated to Army Group Centre, while also reporting to the Wehrmacht's Quartermaster General Eduard Wagner, who had the overall responsibility for rear area security. Schenckendorff controlled three Security Divisions and oversaw the units of Secret Field Police of the Wehrmacht. He operated in parallel, and in cooperation, with Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, the Higher SS and Police Leaders appointed by the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler. Security warfare and crimes against humanity The area commanders' duties included security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combatting guerillas (partisans) in Wehrmacht's rear areas, which were the primary tasks of the security divisions. In addition, security and police formations of the SS and the SD (SS Security Service) operated in the areas, being subordinated to the respective Higher SS and Police Leaders. These units included multiple Einsatzgruppen death squad detachments, Police Regiment Centre and additional Order Police battalions (see Police Battalion 45). These units perpetrated mass murder during The Holocaust and other crimes against humanity. The security formations, often in coordination with or under the leadership of the Wehrmacht, conducted security warfare targeting civilian population. The so-called anti-partisan operations in \\"bandit-infested\\" areas amounted to destruction of villages, seizure of livestock, deporting of able-bodied population for slave labour to Germany and murder of those of non-working age.

(2017). Orites diversifolius. [online] Available at: http://www.understorey-network.org.au/family- index.html?species=Orites%20diversifolius [Accessed 7 Mar. 2017]. The common name stems from the variable form of the leaves, which range from entire and linear to serrated and ovate. It is a common shrub in lowland rainforest, subalpine woodland and scrub. Taxonomy Orites is a genus of the family Proteaceae and is one of twelve Tasmanian genera. Within the genus there are nine species, of which seven are Australian endemics. The remaining two species are South American, located in Bolivia and the Chilean Andes respectively.George, A. and Hyland, B. (1995). Orites. In: Flora of Australia: Volume 16 Elaeagnaceae, Proteaceae 1, 1st ed. Melbourne: CSIRO Australia, pp.346-349. Four Australian endemics, Orites acicularis, Orites diversifolia, Orites milliganii and Orites revolutus, are also endemic to Tasmania.Brown, M., Kirkpatrick, J. and Moscal, A. (1983). An Atlas of Tasmania's Endemic Flora. 1st ed. Hobart: The Tasmanian Conservation Trust Incorporated. Orites diversifolia was discovered by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown in 1804 and the name was published by the Linnaean Society of London in 1810.Flora of Australia: Volume 16 Elaeagnaceae, Proteaceae 1. (1995). 1st ed. Melbourne: CSIRO Australia.Brown, R. (1810). On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. Transactions of the Linnean Society of London, 10(1), pp.15‚Äì226. The name was derived from the Greek word \\"oreites,\\" which translates to ‚Äúmountaineer,‚Äù as the species was discovered on Tasmanian mountains. The species name \\"diversifolia\\" was likely chosen due to the variable nature of the leaves. Description, Orites diversifolia is an erect, rigid, branching shrub to 3m tall which occasionally establishes as a small tree in good conditions. Branches are brown and hairy. The leaves are stiff, leathery and alternate along the stems. Both the upper and lower surfaces are glabrous, with the upper surface a shiny green and the lower surface pale and glaucous. Leaf shape is linear but variable, frequently with serrated edges. Leaf margins are recurved and appear almost flat. Size of the leaf varies significantly with habitat, with subalpine individuals having smaller leaves that are 3‚Äì5 cm long, while rainforest leaves are commonly around 10 cm long.Jordan, G. and Tng, D. (n.d.). Orites diversifolia. [online] Key to Tasmanian Vascular Plants. Available at: http://www.utas.edu.au/dicotkey/dicotkey/PROTS/sOrites_diversifolia.htm [Accessed 9 Mar. 2017]. Orites diversifolia Photo by Robert J Wiltshire The inflorescences are axillary spikes on the upper end of branches which carry approximately twenty flowers on each spike. Flowers are small and very characteristic of the family Proteaceae. They are also sessile and paired in the axils of bracts.Curtis, W. (1967). The Student's Flora of Tasmania: Part 3 Angiospermae: Plumbaginaceae to Salicaceae. 1st ed. Hobart: St. David's Park Publishing, pp.603-604. Flowers are made up of four petaloid tepals (petals and sepals, the perianth, are indistinguishable) which are cream in colour and 4-5mm long. Tepals are linear, less than 1mm in width and are recurved. Each flower has four stamens which rise above the tepals and a superior ovary. Flowers of Orites diversifolia are also sweetly scented. The fruit is a dark brown and moderately woody follicle that splits on one side to release seed. The boat-shaped follicles are located on branch ends in small clusters and are 18-24mm long and 6-8mm wide. Follicles contain two or more seeds which are winged and flattened. Distribution of Orites diversifolia, Tasmania, Australia Map from Atlas of Living Australia Orites diversifolia follicles Photo by Robert J Wiltshire Orites diversifolia Photo by Robert J Wiltshire Habitat and distribution Orites diversifolia is endemic to Tasmania. It is found in lowland rainforest and mixed forest across western Tasmania and in subalpine woodlands and coniferous heath in the south-west to 1300m.Corbett, S. and Balmer, J. (2001). Map and description of the Warra vegetation. Tasforests, 13(1), pp.45-76. Orites diversifolia is common on the subalpine slopes of Mount Wellington and spreads through much of Mount Field National Park and the Southwest National Park.Gibbs, L. (1920). Notes on the Phytogeography and Flora of the Mountain Summit Plateaux of Tasmania. The Journal of Ecology, 8(2), pp.89-117.Ogden, J. and Powell, J. (1979).

It is also found in the south of Bruny Island and around Mt Darwin in the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park. Ecology Cool, moist and shady sites are preferred by this species, however Orites diversifolia can tolerate higher light exposure in the subalpine zone by reducing leaf and overall size. It is both frost and snow tolerant. Orites diversifolia is present in multiple floristic communities which often contain dominant and co-dominant species such as Atherosperma moschatum, Phyllocladus aspleniifolius, Nothofagus spp., Eucryphia spp. and Leptospermum spp.Kitchener, A. and Harris, S. (2005). From Forest to Fjaeldmark: Descriptions of Tasmania's Vegetation. 1st ed. Hobart: Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment, pp.168-181. Orites diversifolia flowers in spring between the months of October and November. Seed is shed from December to February as soon as follicles ripen and dehisce. The seeds of Orites diversifolia have one large terminal wing, suggesting their mode of dispersal is via wind. Cytology Orites diversifolia has a chromosome number of 2n=28, which is consistent with all other species in the tribe Oriteae (includes genus Orites and Neorites), substantiating its taxonomic placement.Wiltshire, R. and Stace, H. (1997). The cytotaxonomy of four Tasmanian genera of Proteaceae. Telopea, 7(3), pp.181-185. Evolution The family Proteaceae are well represented in the fossil record due to the leaves having a high resistance to decay and subsequently many have been discovered in Tasmania.Jordan, G. (1995). Early-Middle Pleistocene leaves of extinct and extant Proteaceae from western Tasmania, Australia. Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 118(1), pp.19-35.Jordan, G., Carpenter, R. and Hill, R. (1998). The macrofossil record of Proteaceae in Tasmania: a review with new species. Australian Systematic Botany, 11(4), pp.465-501. It has been suggested that the current distribution of Orites came about through Gondwanan vicariance and fossil evidence dates the arrival in Australia to the early Oligocene.Carpenter, R. (2012). Proteaceae Leaf Fossils: Phylogeny, Diversity, Ecology and Austral Distributions. The Botanical Review, 78(3), pp.261-287. Despite this, vicariance can never be confirmed and evidence of long distance dispersal to contradict the theory may arise in the future. Macrofossils of an extinct close relative of Orites diversifolia from the Early-Middle Pleistocene known as Orites truncata G.J.Jord. as well as macrofossils of all other extant endemic Tasmanian Orites species were documented in Jordan 1995. This suggests that Orites diversifolia evolved sometime after this period.

In the wall of the gospel the Oratory's main Chapel was built, built by Sancho S√°nchez de Toledo. Pisa, in its History of Toledo, places this chapel among the best in the city. In the recent restoration a Gothic polychrome was discovered. Its design favoured conceptual unity and over time increased Escario's reception. Roman baths The Roman baths of Toledo were located in the area of the Oratory, and there are some remains under the church. They date from the 1st century CE, when Toledo was known as Toletum.

He received his bachelor's degree from the University of North Carolina before joining the staff of the Associated Press as a journalist in 1949. In 1951, the AP sent him to cover the Korean War as a foreign correspondent when he was 23-years old, becoming one of the youngest journalists to cover the conflict. Summerlin left the Associated Press in 1975 to take the position of president and chairman of the news service and syndicate at the New York Times.

In the end, the Universal History comprised 169 treatises averaging around fifteen pages in length but varying widely from a mere fourteen lines (\\"Cosmography\\") to 113 pages (\\"Geography\\").

Roberts and Company Buildings, is a nationally recognized historic district located east of downtown Davenport, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. The Gordon‚ÄìVan Tine Company manufactured pre-cut, mail-order homes in this facility, beginning around 1916. It was incorporated as a subsidiary of the U.N. Roberts lumber company in 1907. They began by selling construction materials to builders, but by 1910 they offered house plans and became one of the first companies in the United States to offer fully pre-cut houses. The customer could choose from a variety of floor plans, finishes, design features, and equipment choices. The lumber for the houses came from company mills in Davenport, Iowa; Chehalis, Washington; St. Louis, Missouri; and from one of two southern lumber yards, first in Louisiana, and then in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. They sold an estimated 54,000 homes under the Gordon‚ÄìVan Tine name, and provided the lumber for another 20,000 to Montgomery Ward company, who contracted with Gordon-Van Tine to supply materials for their Wardway kits, beginning in 1917. While better known for their houses, the company also provided the plans and materials for pre- cut barns. Gordon-Van Tine remained in operation into the post‚ÄìWorld War II housing boom when it was sold to a Cincinnati salvage firm that liquidated it. Two of the buildings in the historic district have been transformed into an apartment complex. The four-story brick office building is the more ornate of the two. The factory was located in a five-story brick building next door. The office building houses 15 apartments, and the production facility houses 98. Commercial retail space was also created in the facility. Revitalization efforts for the $35 million project were begun in 2000 and completed in the summer of 2019.

According to articles in old Lumberman journals and newsletters, that lumber yard did not use the Gordon-Van Tine moniker, but rather operated, first, under the name Funck Lumber. A 1915 issue of Mississippi Valley Lumberman newsletter references the use of the Funk (sic) Lumber yard by Gordon-Van Tine, and the January 18, 1919 issue of The Southern Lumberman , discussing the retirement of George W. Funck, discusses the ownership of the Funck Lumberyard by Davenport's U.N. Roberts lumber company (parent company to Gordon-Van Tine). Gordon-Van Tine offered its first \\"Ready-Cut\\" catalog in 1916, and that year coincides with the year that the St. Louis Funck Lumber Company re-tooled their business to add a wood-working plant for the manufacture of \\"ready cut\\" houses, as mentioned in the March 13, 1916 Iron Age lumberman journal. According to the above-referenced 1919 newsletter article about the retirement of president George W. Funck, that lumber yard was re-named Goodfellow Lumber , upon Funck's retirement. The Funck / Goodfellow Lumberyard was located near the corner of Goodfellow and Natural Bridge Roads, at 5700 Natural Bridge Road, in the city of St. Louis, in what is now the 63120 zip code. St. Louis City directories and St. Louis newspapers of the era, include advertisements for the company, giving this location. The addition of the \\"ready-cut\\" manufacturing section of the lumberyard was a boon for business at Funck Lumberyard, which saw its business revenues triple in 1918 and 1919, according to a January 1920 Southern Lumberman journal article that mentions the change of the company's name to Goodfellow Lumber.

Forer was one of the founders o the National Lawyers Guild and its DC chapter. He was also an expert in the \\"Lost Laws\\" of Washington, DC, enacted in 1872‚Äì1873, that outlawed segregation at business places. Background Silverman Hall at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where Forer studied law Joseph Forer was born in 1911 in Trenton, New Jersey. He received a state scholarship for college. Forer received his BA and MA from Rutgers University, where he excelled as a student and joined Phi Beta Kappa. In 1936, he received a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. In June 1936, Forer received UPenn's \\"Peter McCall Prize.\\" Forer also served on the University of Pennsylvania Law Review as contributor, editor, and managing editor. Career =New Deal= Plaque outside 1099 14th Street NW in Washington, D.C., the NLRB HW (2013), whete Forer worked in the 1930s After graduating from law school, Forer joined the United States Treasury. Around 1937, like his friend David Rein, Forer joined the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Also in 1937, Forer became a founder of the National Lawyers Guild. He served as chairman of the District Affairs Committee of the DC chapter of the National Lawyers Guild. During 1940, he worked for the Rural Electrification Administration. Starting in 1941, he worked in the Office of Price Administration (OPA). Thomas Irwin Emerson (1907‚Äì1991), later a First Amendment scholar, worked with Forer at the NLRB and supervised Forer at OPA. Another OPA colleague was Herman A. Greenberg, director of food enforcement; Forer was direct of apparel and industrial materials enforcement. In his role, Forer helped enforce pricing policies on black market lumber. He noted the need for training of OPA agents in the field. He appeared in legal cases on behalf of OPA, e.g., Porter v. Senderowitz. He upheld legal action against J.C. Penney. While at OPA, Forer first appeared before congressional hearings. On September 27, 1944, as an OPA director, Forer testified as an OPA \\"attorney for the Division\\" of Apparel before a \\"Select Committee of the House of Representatives to Investigate Acts of Executive Agencies Beyond the Scope of Their Authority.\\" He described himself at an \\"enforcement attorney\\" when questioned by US Representative Fred A. Hartley Jr. (Rep-NJ) (soon to be co-sponsor of the Taft-Hartley Act). He advised OPA when companies charges prices higher than government price ceilings. Hartley attacked Forer and colleagues for failing to grant pretrial conference and for appealing an adverse ruling. =Law firm= In August 1948, Forer and Greenberg resigned from the OPA. Later that year, David Rein joined Forer as private practice law partners in Washington, DC. They formed \\"Greenberg, Forer & Rein\\" with Herman Greenberg (who represented Julian Wadleigh just prior to his appearing as a witness during the Hiss-Chambers case). By 1949, the firm was still \\"Greenberg, Forer & Rein\\" at 1105 K Street NW in Washington. In 1950, they listed as \\"Forer & Rein\\" at 711 14 Street NW in 718 of the Kass Building. One of their early clients was the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers (FTA-CIO), a \\"Communist-led union.\\" Another early client was the National Maritime Union. Together, they \\"represented more than 100 persons who had been termed 'unfriendly' witnesses by the House Committee on Un-American Activities, the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee headed by the late senator Joseph McCarthy.\\" =1940s: Mundt-Nixon Bill, Progressive party= In July 1947, Forer represented the FTA CIO against R.J. Reynolds before HUAC when two members pled the Fifth Amendment when asked to name communists. The FTA claimed accusations before HUAC by witness Ann Mathews, who name them among 15 communist members within the union, was really an attack by RJR against an 8,000 FTA strike. In September 1947 during his second appearance before HUAC, Gerhard Eisler asked to have Herman Greenberg and Joseph Forer represent him. On November 28, 1947, Forer, as acting chairman of the First Southest Chapter of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare, charged that members of a Congress Heights Citizens Association had made \\"references to vigilantism and to possible use of violence\\" to keep African-Americans out of that section of town. In December 1947, Forer asked that US Attorney General Tom C. Clark investigate. In early December 1947, Forer and Rein represented the National Maritime Union CIO (NMU) to file a challenge in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, asking the court to invalidate a filing for financial data of unions. On January 26‚Äì28 and February 2, 1948, a hearing of the House Education and Labor Subcommittee, chaired by U.S. Representative Clare E. Hoffman, occurred on the topic of a strike by United Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers (Local 471) and its parent, the United Public Workers of America (UPWA), CIO, against Government Services, Inc. (GSI), which had already lasted nearly a month. Hoffman refused to let UPWA head Abram Flaxer read a statement and asked questions including whether Flaxer was a communist. One of his UAW attorneys, Nathan R. Witt, objected to \\"abuse of congressional power.\\" When Forer rose to follow on from Witt, Hoffman asked him, \\"Are you the same Forer who defended Gerhard Eisler?\\" When Witt objected to Hoffman's question, which led Hoffman to eject Witt from the hearing. On January 26, 1948, UPWA negotiations director Alfred Bernstein (father of Carl Bernstein), charged that House committee agents had raided the union's offices. During January, William S. Tyson, solicitor for the Labor Department, and Robert N. Denham, general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board, both agreed that nothing in the Taft-Hartley Act prohibited GSI from bargaining with a non-complying union. However, Denham added, the Act intended to \\"eliminate Communist influence from unions by denying to such unions the services of NLRB.\\" In February 1948, Forer and Rein, as \\"CIO Attorneys,\\" defended Arkansas strikers before the Supreme Court. In April‚ÄìJune 1948, Forer supported partner David Rein and Abraham J. Isserman in defending Gerhard Eisler, accused of a violation of 52 Stat. 942 (1938), 2 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 192 (refusal to testify) before the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia (which Eisler lost) and then the United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia. (Belford Lawson Jr. (1901-1985), co-founder of the New Negro Alliance (NNA), filed an amicus curiae for the National Lawyers Guild.) Also in April‚ÄìJune 1948, Forer and Rein represented the National Maritime Union and its leaders Joseph Curran and Ferdinand Smith before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia with help from Herman Rosenfeld of New York. In early May 1948, Lee Pressman joined Forer in representing Gerhard Eisler and four others (Irving Potash, vice president of the Fur and Leather Workers Union; Ferdinand C. Smith, secretary of the National Maritime Union; Charles A. Doyle of the Gas, Coke and Chemical Workers Union, and John Williamson, labor secretary of the CPUSA). On May 5, 1946, Pressman and Forer received a preliminary injunction so their defendants might have hearings with examiners unconnected with the investigations and prosecutions by examiners of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. (In May 1949, Eisler jumped bail and secretly boarded the Polish liner MS Batory bound for London.Aksamit Barbara, Batory. Gwiazdy, skandale i mi≈Ço≈õƒá na transatlantyku. Ed. \\"Gazeta Wyborcza\\", Warsaw (Poland) [2017], p. 242-245.) On May 20, 1948, Forer, as a representative of the National Lawyers Guild, \\"assailed the Mundt bill as a threat to civil liberties\\" during a meeting of the Washington, DC, committee of the Conference on Human Welfare. On June 28, 1948, Forer, as a member of the local \\"D.C. Committee for Wallace,\\" chaired a subcommittee meeting regarding the platform of the Progressive Party and its presidential candidate Henry A. Wallace. They were preparing for the 1948 Progressive National Convention on July 23‚Äì25, 1948, in Philadelphia. Issues addressed by the subcommittee included: placing European relief under supervision of the United Nations (rather than the Marshall Plan), disarmament of all nations, without exception, efforts to iron out differences with the USSR, civil rights, a veterans' bonus, end to \\"thought control\\" of Government workers, repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act with reenactment of the National Labor Relations Act, and support for the new state of Israel. In 1949, during the trial of Judith Coplon, Forer examined investigative files submitted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Based on these, he drafted a report for the National Lawyers Guild's Special Committee to Study Certain Alleged Practices of the FBI. In January 1950, the NLG published it as a report for US President Harry S. Truman that accused the FBI of \\"systematic search by illegal methods\\" into the politics of thousands of private citizens, reported the Washington Post. The report focused on FBI methods used against Coplon. The report recommended that the President stop such practices. It also recommended that the President appoint a committee of private citizens to investigate the FBI. In addition to Forer, contributors to the report were NLG president Clifford J. Durr, Frederick K. Beutel, Thomas I. Emmerson, O. John Rogge, James A. Cobb, and Robert J. Silberstein. =1950s: SISS (McCarran, McCarthy)= Cartoon of Albert Einstein, shed of \\"Pacifism\\" wings, standing near pillar of \\"World Peace,\\" rolling up sleeves and holding sword of \\"Preparedness\\" (by Charles R. Macauley, circa 1933) From 1951 to 1953, Forer, with John Abt and Vito Marcantonio, represented the CPUSA in the matter of Herbert Brownell, Jr., Attorney General of the United States, Petitioner v. the Communist Party of the United States of America, Respondent. Also starting in 1951, Forer represented numerous cases in the United States District Court District of Columbia including Bart, Berman, Branca, and Hiskey. On April 8, 1953, Forer represented Howard Selsam of the Jefferson School of Social Science. On April 24, 1953, Forer represented William Frauenglass, an English teacher at the James Madison High School in Brooklyn, New York, before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security. Reading of the testimony, world-famous scientist Albert Einstein wrote Frauenglass a letter, which reached the New York Times (Einstein had added a postscript stating the letter \\"need not remain confidential\\"), advising \\"every intellectual called before a Congressional investigating committee should refuse to testify, and 'must be prepared for jail and economic ruin, in short, for the sacrifice of his personal welfare in the interest of the cultural welfare of his country'.\\" Frauenglass did refuse to testify further ‚Äì and he did lose his job. (See \\"Political views of Albert Einstein\\") In 1956, Forer and partner Rein supported Harold I. Cammer in dfense of Ben Gold in Ben Gold v. United States in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On February 29, 1959, partner Herman A. Greenberg appeared before the SISS as counsel for Mark Zborowski (a Soviet spy involved in the deaths of Lev Sedov and his father Leon Trotsky as well as spying on David Dallin, Victor Kravchenko). In 1957, Forer supported partner David Rein in Rowoldt v. Perfetto before the United States Supreme Court with support from Ann Fagan Ginger. That same year, HUAC published part 2 of its report Communist Political Subversion, which included a highly detailed account of a \\"testimonial banquet\\" held on 11 October 1956 for Forer and Rein as \\"attorneys defending Charles Rowoldt\\" before the Supreme Court on 15 October 1956. The account even included a list of guests for 21 tables. In 1958, Forer represented Clara Hutcherson Saba before HUAC. In 1961, Forer and Nathan Witt represented the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers in Robert F. Kennedy, Attorney General of the United States, Petitioner, v. International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, Respondent before the Subversive Activities Control Board. =Lost Laws and DC v. John R. Thompson Co.= Mary Church Terrell Painting of Mary Church Terrell by Betsy Graves Reyneau, 1888‚Äì1964 In May 1949, Dr. Mary Church Terrell decided to take on the issue of desegregation head-on. She consulted Forer. Forer led the National Lawyers Guild's DC chapter in submitting an opinion in their favor. With such advice, Dr. Terrell and colleagues Clark F. King, Essie Thompson, and Arthur F. Elmer entered the segregated Thompson's Restaurant, next door to the offices of Forer and Rein's office at 711 14th Street NW, in Washington, DC, between H an G Streets cut by New York Avenue and across the street from the Trans-Lux Theatre. When refused service, Terrell & Co. sued. Attorney Ringgold Hart, representing Thompson, argued on April 1, 1950, that District laws were unconstitutional. Regardless, Forer's research found that the U.S. Congress had jurisdiction over DC and so could overrule segregation; Charles H. Houston, dean of Howard University Law School concurred. Specifically, Forer found that anti-segregation laws had passed and been enforced in the 1870s, including a case involving Harvey's Restaurant in 1874. District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co. Supreme Court of the United States. The case District of Columbia v. John R. Thompson Co. reached the U.S. Supreme Court. Forer and Rein argued the case. On June 8, 1953, the court ruled that segregated eating places in Washington, DC, were unconstitutional. The Washington Post recounted in 1985, \\"Four days after the Supreme Court ruled, Mary Terrell and the three other original complainants went back to Thompson's. Joe Forer followed them in. As he recalls the moment, the manager, himself, came over and personally, even obsequiously, carried Mary Terrell's tray to the table.\\" =Supreme Court cases= Between 1948 and 1951 alone, Forer & Rein dealt with more than 20 cases before the United States Supreme Court. Forer argued several cases involving the First Amendment to the United States Constitution: * 1948: Cole v. Arkansas (with David Rein, both serving as attorneys for the CIO) * 1960: ** Chaunt v. United States ** Kimm v. Rosenberg * 1961: Communist Party of the United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board * 1964: Aptheker v. Secretary of State * 1967: Giles v. Maryland * 1969: Watts v. United States Communist Party of the United States v. Subversive Activities Control Board During Communist Party of the United States vs. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U.S. 1 (1961), Forer served as co-counsel with John Abt to represent the CPUSA. Giles- Johnson case In 1961, three African-American youths (James Giles, John Giles, and Joseph Johnson) received death sentences for allegedly raping a white teenage girl. The severity of the sentence, suppression of evidence by the State of Maryland, and other actions led to public perception of racisim, which led to formation of the Giles-Johnson Defense Committee in July 1962 by Mrs. Howard Ross and 60 other Maryland residents. Forer joined the committee and came to lead its lawyers. Thanks to its efforts, Governor J. Millard Tawes commuted the death sentences to life imprisonment in October 1963. Their efforts led to a decision by Circuit Court Judge Walter Moorman for a new trial in 1964. On April 7, 1965, the State of Maryland asked its court of appeal to deny the Giles brothers, represented by Forer, a new trial. On July 13, 1965, the Maryland Court of Appeals refused to allow the trial. The case reached the Supreme Court as Giles v. Maryland, with argument on October 12, 1966, by Forer and Hall Witt (hired by the NAACP ) and decision on February 20, 1967. In 1967, the Giles brothers received a retrial, which resulted in a drop of charges. In 1968 Joseph Johnson received a pardon by Governor Spiro T. Agnew. =Other cases= Forer & Rein served the rights of striking workers, foreign-born aliens (with leftist leanings, e.g., Gerhard Eisler), and servicemen. They won for the National Council for American-Soviet Friendship the right to contest in court its designation by the attorney general as a \\"subversive organization.\\" Forer & Rein also represented members of the press on strike against the Washington Post in 1975. =FBI target= In 1977, a release of internal memos of the FBI revealed, according to the Washington Post, that: > An Oct. 4, 1951 memo to Hoover said that a search of trash at the Washington > offices of guild lawyers Joseph Forer and David Rein had uncovered a draft > resolution urging President Truman to authorize a citizens' investigation of > the FBI because of its alleged excesses in loyalty checks. =Retirement= Forer retired from practice with Rein in July 1978. On June 9, 1979, the Washington, DC, chapter of the National Lawyers Guild held an evening event to celebrate his career. Personal and death Forer's daughter, Jane F. Gentleman, is a notable statistician. He was the uncle of author Richard Forer. Forer, Rein, and many friends and associates lived at Trenton Terrace, 950 Mississippi Avenue SE, Washington DC 20032. As a child, Carl Bernstein knew Joseph Forer and David Rein. Forer died age 75 on June 20, 1986. Legacy In 1954, following the outcome of the Thompson Case, schools in Washington, DC, began to desegregate, followed by jobs, buses, and government services. Archives of the Giles-Johnson Defense Council reside at the Hornbake Library at the University of Maryland. The Bancroft Library at the University of California/Berkeley houses papers of Forer along with other members (Osmond K. Fraenkel, Carol Weiss King, Samuel Neuburger, David Freedman, Justine Wise Polier, Jeremiah Gutman, Martin Popper, Abraham Isserman, Dennis Roberts, Robert J. Silberstein, Justice Raymond Peters, and George W. Crockett, Jr.) of the National Lawyers Guild and its predecessor, the International Juridical Association. As historian Joan Quigley describes: > In the late 1940s, while Congress and the executive branch trawled for > evidence of disloyalty and subversion, Rein and Forer immersed themselves in > difficult and disfavored causes: opposing the Mundt-Nixon Bill; defending > labor unions and alleged Communists; upholding the Bill of Rights. Rein ... > represented Gerhard Eisler ... As progressives and New Deal veterans, Forer > and Rein also nurtured ties to the National Lawyers Guild, which HUAC had > branded a Communist front in 1944. Historian Maarten Zwiers refers to him as \\"the Communist Party's lawyer.\\" and wrote: > Joe Forer ... was senior partner in Forer and Rein, the Communist Party's > leading law firm in the capital. He had defended people accused of communist > sympathies before Eastland's Internal Security Subcommittee on several > occasions ... Historian Marvin Caplan wrote: > When a staff attorney at a HUAC hearing asked Joe Forer how many times he > had appeared before the committee, Forer couldn't remember.

It is approximately long and flows through Allen Township and Northampton. The stream is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. It is often dry. Course Dry Run begins in a flat area west of Sauerkraut Hill in Allen Township. It flows south for several tenths of a mile before crossing Pennsylvania Route 329 and continuing to flow south. The stream eventually begins to gradually turn southwest and enters Northampton. Here, it flows west-southwest for a few tenths of a mile before turning southwest for several tenths of a mile. The stream then reaches its confluence with the Lehigh River. Dry Run joins the Lehigh River upstream of its mouth. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Dry Run is above sea level. The elevation near the stream's source is above sea level. Watershed The watershed of Dry Run has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Catasauqua. Polluted stormwater in Allen Township has the potential to impact Dry Run. However, an NPDES permit was once issued for discharge of stormwater into the stream, associated with construction activities. The stream frequently is dry. History Dry Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1173531. In 1787, Christian Schwartz constructed a large stone house at the mouth of Dry Run. A lost Pratt through truss bridge was once built over Dry Run for the Lehigh Valley Transit Co. Historically, a trolley bridge crossed the stream and a school was located near this bridge. In 2014, the Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor received $217,000 from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development to replace a pedestrian bridge over the stream.

It was built in 1962 by the Stead Foundation. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002.  History  Land on which the sanctuary is situated was acquired in a number of ways. In 1962, a Sydney accountant, Carmen Coleman, discovered this interesting area of remnant bush where Europeans at Bargo made the first sightings of koala and lyrebird. Carmen Coleman donated the parcel of land at Bargo to the David G. Stead Memorial Wildlife Research Foundation, which was established in 1963 to perpetuate the memory of David Stead who was a pioneer of nature conservation in Australia. The National Trust began its association with the Stead Foundation and the Sanctuary in 1963. Wirrimbirra is an intact remnant example of Bargo Bush, which once covered an extensive area south of Sydney. Part of Wirrimbirra is freehold, which is now owned by the National Trust, and the balance is Crown Land with the National Trust \\"trustee for the conservation and study of flora and fauna\\". The Stead Foundation gave the freehold land to the Trust together with buildings and improvements in 1965, and at the same time arranged for the Crown leases to be transferred to the Trust. The Sanctuary was further extended in 1975. In 1989 the National Trust purchased a narrow strip of land on the southern boundary to improve fire protection for the Field Studies Centre which had been opened in 1971. Wirrimbirra Native Plant Nursery is registered as a Nursery under the NSW Horticultural Stock and Nursery Act, and a white waratah has its varietal name registered as \\"Wirrimbirra White\\" and is the National Variety Register in Canberra. The Sanctuary contains rich and diverse plantings of native plants in formalised gardens, which were developed to provide areas of representative native plans for education and research purposes. Within the 43 established gardens, there are over 1800 native plants representing a resource base for the study of native flora. The Field Studies Centre has proved to be the most popular part of the Sanctuary and is recognised as a leading institution in environmental education, both locally and overseas. Wirrimbirra was gifted to the National Trust (NSW) by the David G. Stead Memorial Wildlife Research Foundation in 1965. The property was leased to the Foundation for several terms up to the present time. Recently a small portion was separately leased to the Australian Native Dog Conservation Society. A comprehensive Conservation Agreement with the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage has been developed for the Wirrimburra Sanctuary to ensure that the native vegetation is managed and conserved in perpetuity. In late 2015 the National Trust of Australia (NSW) classified the Bargo Gorge Landscape Conservation Area.Quint, 2015, 3.  Description  Wirrimbirra Sanctuary covers is an area of about . Located about halfway between the Bargo River Crossing and the village of Bargo on the Hume Highway, approximately south of Sydney. Wirrimbirra preserves a part of the original \\"Bargo Brush\\" which was of considerable historical importance in the problems which faced the settlement of the Argyle or Southern Tablelands during the early half of the 1800s. The Sanctuary contains rich and diverse plantings of native plants in formalised gardens, which were developed to provide areas of representative native plans for education and research purposes. Within the 43 established gardens, there are over 1800 native plants representing a resource base for the study of native flora. The Administration Area contains all the buildings, including two rangers' cottages, an office and bookshop, a display area and amenities. A native plant nursery provides plants for the property and for sale. Within the Sanctuary there is the capacity to accommodate groups of up to 44 people in five-bunk style cabins in the Environmental Studies Centre. One of the few forested areas remaining on the flat plateau of the Bargo area. = Modifications and dates = *2008: upgrading of pathways, services on site.National Trust 2008, 11 *November 2008-January 2009: National trust Magazine NSW: Wirrimbirra: $15,281 was allocated to assist with the pathways, services and routine maintenance of the site.  Heritage listing  As at 30 June 2000, Wirrimbirra is significant for its role in the development of the conservation movement in NSW; its association with key persons who pioneered the conservation debate; as a natural area with a rich and diverse flora and fauna, including rare and endangered species; as a recreation and social area; as a historic site containing relics and cultural items, as well as being associated with the pioneering expeditions to the Southern Highlands; as an area containing extensive plantings of native plants including rare and endangered species, and as an area which encouraged investigations into the growing and propagation of native plants. Wirrimbirra Sanctuary was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Significant for its role in the development of the conservation movement in NSW, and for its association with key persons who pioneered conservation debate, the evolution of the conservation movement in Australia and environmental education in NSW. Also associated with pioneering expeditions which led to the settlement of the Southern Highlands Region and the first written report of the koala and lyrebird in Australia. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Sanctuary forms part of a link between the large natural areas of the Metropolitan and Warragamba Catchments and the Greater Blue Mountains and is therefore significant as a corridor for wildlife, particularly as areas immediately to the South of the Sanctuary have been cleared.
