Several novels, films, and television series have examined the presidential line of succession and speculated on how it might be implemented in unusual circumstances. The following are some examples of fictional portrayals of United States presidential succession: Books * Advise and Consent by Allen Drury (1959): After a heated and unsuccessful political battle over a controversial nominee for Secretary of State, the President dies of a heart attack, and his Vice President, Harley Hudson, succeeds him. Drury wrote five subsequent sequel novels. In the third sequel, Preserve and Protect (1968), President Hudson is killed in a mysterious plane crash, elevating the Speaker of the House to the presidency. Advise and Consent was also made into a film in 1962 (see below). * Alas, Babylon by Pat Frank (1959): A global nuclear war eliminates the line of succession down to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Josephine Vanbruuker-Brown, who identifies herself as being the most junior official in the line of succession. * American Empire: The Center Cannot Hold by Harry Turtledove (2002) (part of the Southern Victory and American Empire Series of alternate history novels): In the 1932 Presidential election, Democratic candidate Calvin Coolidge defeats Socialist incumbent President Hosea Blackford in a landslide. However, less than a month before Coolidge is to be sworn in, he dies of a heart attack while in Washington, D.C. to meet with his Cabinet selections on January 5, 1933. Under the 20th Amendment, Vice President‚Äìelect Herbert Hoover is sworn in to serve Coolidge's term. * Arc Light by Eric L. Harry (1994), features the 25th Amendment in the context of a limited nuclear war. President Walter Livingston is impeached for warning China that Russia was preparing to attack them, which resulted in a Russian nuclear strike on the United States. His hawkish Vice President Paul Costanzo is then sworn in. * The Boys by Garth Ennis (2006-12). In this alternate- history comic book series where persons with superhuman abilities begin appearing during and over the decades following World War II, as well as serving as a satire on the superhero genre, the President elected in 2000 is Robert \\"Dakota Bob\\" Shaefer (described as having previously served as Vice- President under George H. W. Bush). Shaefer dies in an unlikely accident, elevating his loathed Vice-President Victor \\"Vic the Veep\\" Neuman to the top post. Neuman is later murdered by the Homelander in an attempted coup by superhumans to seize the White House and Pentagon. The coup is defeated and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi assumes the presidency as the 2008 election approaches. * The Calculating Stars by Mary Robinette Kowal (2018): In 1952, Secretary of Agriculture Charles F. Brannan is touring farms in Kansas when a meteorite strike obliterates Washington, D.C. He is the only surviving member of the line of succession, and serves as acting president until a new Congress can be seated to confirm him. * Debt of Honor/Executive Orders by Tom Clancy (1994/1996): After Vice President Ed Kealty resigns following a sex scandal, National Security Advisor Jack Ryan is appointed to fill the position for the remainder of the term.

Ryan, who barely escapes, is then sworn in as the new President. * Deep Six by Clive Cussler (1984): After the presidential yacht, the Eagle, goes missing with the President, Vice President Vincent Margolin, Speaker of the House Alan Moran and President of the Senate pro tempore Marcus Larimer on board, Secretary of State (and now Acting President) Douglas Oates orders a cover-up, with actors playing the President and Vice President while Oates executes executive powers. * Directive 51 by John Barnes (2008): Focuses on the office of the National Continuity Coordinator as he tries to restore the presidency. The book covers several potential scenarios through the presidency of four different men in a period of less than a year. * Down to a Sunless Sea by David Graham (1979): It is reported to Air Britain pilot Jonah Scott, by his superior, that the acting president, James McCracken, from an undisclosed location but presumably a bunker, has reported that the United States has suffered a nuclear attack and that the USSR and China were \\"paying the price for their crimes against humanity.\\" Presumably the first African-American president, Booker T. Langford, was killed or rendered incapable of executing the office. * Empire by Orson Scott Card (2006), features the assassinations of the president and vice president and the subsequent ascension of the Speaker of the House. The assassinations result in a civil war, eventually revealed to be instigated by the National Security Advisor, who is himself subsequently elected President. * The 14th Colony by Steve Berry (2016) (Cotton Malone Series #11), investigates what happens if both the president and Vice President‚Äìelect die before taking the oath of office.

Kennedy) from office, using the 25th Amendment, claiming that he is mentally unfit to serve following the assassination of his daughter. * Full Disclosure by William Safire (1978): The president is blinded by an assassination attempt while at a summit meeting in the Soviet Union, and an ambitious Secretary of the Treasury attempts to use the 25th Amendment to unseat him. In time, several members of his Cabinet come to believe that his blindness renders him unable to discharge the duties of his office, and they vote to replace him with the Vice President under the terms of the 25th Amendment. The President survives this vote but realizes that his political effectiveness is virtually at an end. He prevails upon the weak-willed Vice President to resign, and then promptly resigns himself, elevating the Speaker of the House to the Presidency. * The General's President by John Dalmas (1990): As the result of catastrophic economic disaster brought on by a global oil crisis, the president commits suicide. Congress abdicates responsibility and grants unrestricted emergency powers to the office of the president. The vice president assumes the presidency but quickly begins to crack under the strain, and asks his closest friend, the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to accept the vice presidency, after which the president will immediately resign. * Give Me Liberty, a graphic novel by Frank Miller (1990): An alternate history in which America is led through a time of economic depression and civil uprisings by President Erwin Rexall, who is elected in the year 1996. By the year 2009, just as his fourth term is beginning (he has been effective in repealing the 22nd Amendment), the White House is destroyed, President Rexall is incapacitated, and Vice President Cargo, along with all but one member of the Cabinet, is killed. The Secretary of Agriculture, Howard Nissen, assumes the presidency. * Interface by Neal Stephenson and George Jewsbury (1994).

The incumbent President, defeated for re-election in November, wants to use the situation to stay in office. * The Man by Irving Wallace (1964): The Vice President has died of a heart attack, and the office is vacant (the 25th Amendment had not yet been written). The President and the Speaker of the House both die as the result of the accidental collapse of a building, and the President pro tempore of the Senate, an African-American, becomes President. (In the conditions prevailing at the time of writing - with the right of African-Americans to civil equality still hotly disputed in the South - Wallace assumed that it was impossible for one of them to achieve the presidency by direct election, and that the only way it could happen would be by an unlikely accident). * The Negotiator by Frederick Forsyth (1989): The President's only child is abducted and murdered. The President's grief, compounded by not knowing who committed the crime or why, causes him to lose focus on his duties and even to contemplate suicide. The Vice President and other Cabinet members consider declaring the President incapable; the abduction/murder is revealed (to the reader and to a few of the characters) as a conspiracy with exactly that objective. * Night of Camp David by Fletcher Knebel (1965): Popular incumbent President Mark Hollenbach feels betrayed by his corrupt vice president and seeks a new running mate for his re-election, deciding on freshman Senator Jim MacVeagh‚Äîbut when he confers with the President alone at the Camp David presidential retreat, MacVeagh becomes alarmed when Hollenbach denounces enemies whom he says are conspiring against him and lays out his secret radical plans for the nation during his second term, including giving himself sweeping powers to wiretap those real or imagined enemies and forming a political union between the United States, Canada and Scandinavia. Certain the President has become unhinged, MacVeagh tries to convince other political leaders that Hollenbach is crazy and must be removed from office (this was before the passage of the 25th Amendment) - but their options for dealing with a dangerously delusional and paranoid President are limited. * The People's Choice: A Cautionary Tale by Jeff Greenfield (1996): A conservative Republican president-elect dies in an accident only a few days after the general election, and therefore before the Electoral College has met. * The Plot Against America by Philip Roth (2004): In this alternate history, Charles Lindbergh is nominated by the Republican Party in 1940 and defeats Roosevelt on an isolationist platform. When he disappears in The Spirit of St. Louis after a campaign stop, Vice President Burton Wheeler seizes power and initiates an antisemitic witch-hunt. * The President's Plane Is Missing by Robert Serling (1967): Air Force One crashes in a storm and the body of President Haynes cannot be found. Meantime, a growing crisis between the U.S. and the People's Republic of China threatens to lead to war and Vice President Madigan pressures the cabinet to declare him Acting President under the terms of the 25th Amendment so he can launch a pre-emptive strike. * The Probability Broach by L. Neil Smith (1980) (part of the North American Confederacy Series) in which the United States becomes a Libertarian state after a successful Whiskey Rebellion and the overthrowing and execution of George Washington by firing squad for treason in 1794, President H. L. Mencken assassinates his vice president in a duel in 1933. However, he is then killed by the vice president's mother. This results in the Continental Congress choosing Frank Chodorov as a successor. * The Prodigal Daughter by Jeffrey Archer. Florentyna Kane first serves in Congress then the Senate. Midway through the book, she runs for President but ends up becoming Vice President to President Parker. As Vice President, she assumes command of the military in President Parker's absence, as indeed the law states that when the President is indisposed all power is vested in the Vice President, when an invasion is launched against the United States and orders the military to intercept the invaders who turn back. Following a heated argument with President Parker, she decides not to run for a second time as Vice President. While playing golf with her future husband Edward, she decides to wait until the helicopters have passed overhead. Instead, the helicopters land and Florentyna is informed that the President is dead from a heart attack. At her own home, she is sworn in as President of the United States. Her Presidency continues in a rewrite of the Archer book Shall We Tell the President? * Promises to Keep by George Bernau (1988): An alternate history in which President John T. Cassidy (representing John F. Kennedy) survives the assassination attempt in Dallas, but is wounded in the head. The book deals with the political implications of an ambitious Vice President (Rance Gardner, representing Lyndon B. Johnson) who becomes Acting President thanks to a presidential letter signed by Cassidy that resembles the as-yet-unratified 25th Amendment. * Resurrection Day by Brendan DuBois (1999): When the Cuban Missile Crisis erupts into a full-scale nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, several U.S. cities are destroyed - among them, Washington, D.C., which results in the deaths of President Kennedy and his family, Vice President Johnson, most of the Senate and Congress, and most members of the Kennedy administration.

Vice President Charles W. La Follette is then sworn in as President. * Seven Days in May by Charles W. Bailey II and Fletcher Knebel (1962). The machinations of an attempted military coup by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. The 1994 film adaptation, The Enemy Within, adds the application of the 25th Amendment in order to assume the presidency, which was not yet enacted in 1962. * The Sum of All Fears by Tom Clancy (1991): After a nuclear device explodes in Denver, President Robert Fowler‚Äîbelieving that the current Ayatollah is behind it‚Äîorders a nuclear strike on Qom, Iran in retaliation. Because of a terrible snowstorm, only Jack Ryan is available to confirm his order under the two-man rule. Ryan declares the order to be invalid, stopping the attack. Fowler suffers a nervous breakdown and is forced from office under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment and is replaced by Vice President Roger Durling. * Thirty-Four East by Alfred Coppel (1974): The Vice President is kidnapped by Arab terrorists during a visit to the Middle East; at the same time, the President is killed in the accidental crash of Air Force One. With the Vice President incapacitated, the Speaker of the House, a weak man manipulated by the ambitious Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, becomes Acting President. * Trinity's Child by William Prochnau (1983): A massive nuclear attack on the United States wipes out Washington and half of the Cabinet. The Secretary of the Interior assumes the Presidency and continues to fight World War III. The real President is found to still be living; however, the Secretary of the Interior refuses to relinquish his new office. * Warday by Whitley Strieber and James Kunetka (1984): The 25th Amendment is incidentally referenced as part of a larger post-apocalyptic narrative. Following a nuclear war, much of the United States is destroyed, including Washington. The Deputy Secretary of the Treasury is eventually found, and deemed to be the highest-ranking politician to survive the war. He is installed as President, but insists that he is merely a caretaker and refuses to use the full title of the office. * White House Storm by Dale Napier (2014) (Book 1 of the Queen Joan series) in which General Strom \\"Stormy\\" Thornton attempts a military coup after his secret discovery that President Charley Davidson has Alzheimer's. This tribute to Seven Days In May features the invocation of the 25th Amendment after the Alzheimer's problem become general knowledge, focusing on the requirement of notifying the Speaker of the House and the Senate President Pro-tempore - leading to several fire fights between the White House and the Capitol, and Acting President Joan Queenan facing down Army tanks on the front law of the White House. * Worldwar: Upsetting the Balance/Worldwar: Striking the Balance by Harry Turtledove (1996/1997): During the interplanetary war between The Race and the formerly warring powers of World War II, Seattle is destroyed in 1943 by the Race in retaliation for the U.S. destruction of a Conquest Fleet division in Chicago. The strike on Seattle kills Vice President Henry Wallace, who was visiting the city at the time. In 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt dies of unspecified causes. With the Vice Presidency vacant, Secretary of State Cordell Hull assumes the Presidency after Roosevelt's death, as he is the holder of the next-highest post. * Y: The Last Man by Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra (2003‚Äì2008): In this comic book series published by Vertigo, every male mammal on Earth but two simultaneously die of a mysterious plague.

Films * Advise & Consent (1962), an adaptation of Allen Drury's best- selling novel (see above). A gravely-ill President (Franchot Tone) attempts to install a controversial nominee for Secretary of State, despite reservations by leading members of his own party in the U.S. Senate.

I haven't any time to run a school for presidents. The President dies in office and his Vice President, Harley Hudson, succeeds him. * Air Force One (1997), starring Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman: After Air Force One has been captured by Kazakh terrorists, with President Jim Marshall (Ford) on board, the Secretary of Defense claims that he's in charge (at least on military/defense matters) based on the National Security Act of 1947, against the disagreement of the Attorney General who argues that the President is incapable of discharging the office, \\"just as if he had had a stroke\\". Since the President is being held by terrorists and forced into using his authority to release a terrorist leader, the majority of the Cabinet endorses the Attorney General's position and assumes the Vice President possesses acting authority, while also beginning the invocation of Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, signing a letter to that effect, whereby Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) would assume command. Bennett, uncertain of the President's situation and unwilling to be seen as making a grab for power, refuses to finalize the President's removal from power. President Marshall kills head terrorist Egor Korshunov (Oldman) and is rescued from the crippled Air Force One, the last person to leave the plane alive. *Angel Has Fallen (2019), starring Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman: a drone attack carried out a private military company leaves President Allan Trumbull (Freeman) in a coma and Vice President Martin Kirby (Tim Blake Nelson) sworn in as Acting President. Kirby is later revealed to be behind the assassination plot, and tries to frame Russia for it. Trumbull awakens from the coma he is reinstated as President. Following his trip to the G20 summit in Hamburg, he orders Kirby's arrest. *By Dawn's Early Light (1990), adaptation of William Prochnau's novel Trinity's Child (see above), starring Powers Boothe, Rebecca De Mornay, and James Earl Jones.

Once the doppelganger realizes what is happening, he thwarts the Chief of Staff's political intentions and then arranges to switch back with the real President (who is still in a coma), by feigning a stroke himself. The true President succumbs to the stroke, and, after serving as Acting President for five months, the Vice President (Ben Kingsley) is sworn into office. * The Day After Tomorrow (2004), starring Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal: When the world's climate goes into chaos causing freak weather all over the Northern Hemisphere, the government is evacuated.

The President's authority is challenged by the politically-popular Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. To obtain power, the Chairman plans to have the President (played by Sam Waterston) declared incompetent by the Cabinet and replaced by the Vice President, who would then be a \\"puppet\\" to the Chairman. (This implementation of the planned coup d'etat differs sharply from that of the original novel.) * In Independence Day: Resurgence, the President and most of the Cabinet are killed in an alien attack, and officials arrive at Area 51 to swear General Joshua Adams into office. * Iron Man 3 (2013), a superhero film directed by Shane Black. A terrorist codenamed The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) conducts a bombing campaign against the United States, intending to assassinate President Ellis (William Sadler) in the final attack. This is later revealed to be a cover for Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), a scientist and defense contractor, who plans to kill Ellis so that Vice President Rodriguez (Miguel Ferrer), who is under his influence, will elevate to the office of the Presidency and thus allow Killian to control the War on Terror. * The Man (1972), a theatrical film adaptation of the Irving Wallace book (see above). Screenplay by Rod Serling, starring James Earl Jones, Martin Balsam and Burgess Meredith. In the movie, the Vice President is still alive but elderly and infirm; he declines to assume the Presidency upon the death of the President. The Presidency thus passes to the black President pro tem of the Senate. * Mars Attacks! (1996), a sci-fi comedy in which the President and his wife, along with millions of others, likely including the entire line of succession, are killed in an alien invasion. At the end of the film, the President's daughter is seen serving as acting President, a situation unlikely to occur in reality as the presidency is not a hereditary position. * Murder at 1600 (1997), starring Wesley Snipes.

This would allow the elevation of the Vice President, who would then take military action to rescue hostages held by North Korea, action the sitting President is unwilling to take. * My Fellow Americans (1996), starring Jack Lemmon and James Garner. The President is forced to resign, in a plan orchestrated by the scheming Vice President. Eventually his scheme is revealed and he is impeached, making the House Speaker President.

During a meeting with the South Korean Prime Minister at the White House, a North Korean terrorist cell launches an aerial attack on Washington, D.C. which forces President Benjamin Asher, his national security staff and the South Korean delegation to be evacuated to the White House bunker. However, North Korean terrorists have infiltrated the Prime Minister's delegation and take everyone in the bunker including Asher & Vice President Charlie Rodriguez hostage. Speaker of the House Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) becomes Acting President. Vice President Rodriguez is executed while in the bunker, but President Asher is recovered safely and reassumes office. * The President's Plane Is Missing (1973), a made-for-TV adaptation of the Robert Serling novel (see above), starring Buddy Ebsen as Vice President Madigan, who tries to assume the Presidency after Air Force One crashes and the president's body cannot be found. * 2012 (2009), a science fiction apocalyptic disaster film based loosely on the 2012 phenomenon.

When the President adopts an internationalist policy of diplomacy towards enemies of the United States, the hawkish Secretary of Defense attempts a coup that will wipe out key members of the government during the President's State of the Union address, leaving him in charge. Television * 24: ** In season 2, the Cabinet of President David Palmer invokes Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, declaring that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office after making irrational decisions regarding the country's response to a terrorist attack. Vice President Jim Prescott immediately assumes the powers and duties of the office as Acting President. A few hours later, Palmer's decisions are shown to be rational, at which time Prescott and the Cabinet rescind their earlier vote. At the end of that day's events, Palmer is incapacitated by a biological weapon, and Prescott is again sworn in as Acting President (shown in 24: The Game). Upon the first vote that removes him from power, Palmer is advised he can appeal the judgment to Congress in four days. In actuality, the invoked 25th Amendment provision specifies that a president who has been declared unable to serve may subsequently‚Äîat any time‚Äîissue a declaration stating that he is able. It also specifies that, if such a declaration is made, the vice president and the cabinet have four days to renew their declaration of the president's incapacity (the vice president remaining as acting president in the meantime) and send the issue to Congress; if they do not, then the president resumes his powers and duties immediately. ** In season 4, President John Keeler is severely injured when Air Force One is shot down by a stealth fighter. The Cabinet unanimously invokes the 25th Amendment and Vice President Charles Logan is sworn in shortly thereafter. Logan serves as President throughout season 5, by which time he has appointed a new Vice President, which implies he has fully assumed the Presidency, rather than acting as President. Keeler is never confirmed to have died on screen, although this could be inferred as the possibility of his return to power would supersede the need to confirm a new Vice President, and Logan, while acting as President, would technically still be the Vice President. ** In the season 5 finale (first aired May 22, 2006), Logan is taken into custody by the United States Marshals Service after evidence emerges that he was party to the assassination of former President David Palmer. It is implied that Logan will either resign his office or face impeachment proceedings. Vice President Hal Gardner is assumed to become President upon Logan's impeachment. ** In season 6, President Wayne Palmer is severely injured when a bomb in the White House Bunker goes off. Apparently per Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, Vice President Noah Daniels becomes Acting President; the Secretary of Defense deemed the injuries that Palmer sustained too severe to hope for the president's full recovery. Later, when Daniels orders a low-scale nuclear strike on an Arab nation suspected of having terrorist ties, National Security Advisor Karen Hayes arranges for doctors to revive Palmer, who cancels the strike. In a move similar to the second season, Daniels suggests Palmer is still not fit for command, citing his cancellation of the strike as evidence. The Cabinet is convened for a hearing and votes 7-7 on the subject of Palmer's fitness. The Attorney General rightly points out that the Vice President can only invoke the 25th Amendment when a majority of the Cabinet agrees, and a tie vote does not constitute a majority. Daniels then claims that Hayes' vote should not count as she technically resigned earlier in the day, although she claims she returned and rescinded her resignation before it was officially accepted. The Supreme Court is asked to decide the issue of Hayes' status, but Daniels withdraws his objection after Chief of Staff Tom Lennox produces evidence of Daniels and his aide conspiring to manufacture evidence against Hayes. Palmer retains executive authority, then orders the attack anyway. However, Palmer later succumbs to his injuries during a live press conference, and Daniels is again installed as Acting President. * In season one of The Americans during the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, Phillip and Elizabeth prepare to take out several members of the presidential line of succession in fear of a coup led by the Secretary of State. * Commander in Chief (2005): ** The President, Teddy Bridges, suffers from a severe brain hemorrhage and lapses into a coma. His Vice President, Mackenzie Allen (Geena Davis), an independent, is strongly pressured by the President's senior staff and political allies to resign from office. However, she instead chooses to await the outcome of the President's condition. When the President comes out of his coma and himself urges her to resign, she respectfully declines, explaining that the voters entrusted her with the Vice Presidency, and she intends to carry out its duties fully. The President dies shortly thereafter and she assumes the office of President of the United States, becoming the first woman ever to do so. ** Later in the season, President Allen's chosen Vice President resigns and then she requires emergency surgery. The Speaker of the House, next in line, is her political enemy, Republican House Speaker Nathan Templeton (Donald Sutherland); he chooses to resign his House seat and accept the temporary acting presidency under the 25th Amendment, and uses his one day in office to take an action that Allen would never have countenanced. When she resumes office, she is angered at what she considers his irresponsibility, and more determined than ever to defeat him in the coming election. (The series was canceled before the election would have occurred.) * Designated Survivor: An explosion on the night of the State of the Union kills the President and all present members of the Cabinet. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Tom Kirkman, who was named the designated survivor, is immediately sworn in. * The Doctor Who episode The Sound of Drums features \\"President-Elect\\" Arthur Colman Winters acting in a governing capacity, although in real life this does not occur. The President-Elect is subsequently killed and no successor is immediately identified. Russell T Davies, the writer of The Sound of Drums has said that he thought \\"President-Elect\\" was the full title of the President and that the character was meant to be the full President of the United States. As the episode was broadcast and set during 2007 and the 2009/2010 two-part story \\"The End of Time\\" featured Barack Obama as President, the \\"President-Elect\\" may well have served as a stand-in for George W. Bush (with Obama being elected in his own right as opposed to succeeding an assassinated predecessor). * Freedom: In the short-lived TV series Freedom, Air Force One is shot down, killing the President. In the opening pilot episode, due to extreme violent protests and terrorism within the US, the Vice President hands over government control to the Joint Chiefs, resulting in a military dictatorship within the US. * In the US version of House of Cards, U.S. Representative Francis Underwood sponsors the candidacy of another Representative, Peter Russo, for Governor of Pennsylvania, then intentionally destroys his candidacy. He then urges the Vice President, who was the Governor of Pennsylvania before he ran for Vice President, and who is becoming increasingly disenchanted with his new job, to resign and run to retake his old position‚ÄîUnderwood's plan being that he will then angle to be appointed Vice President under the terms of the 25th Amendment. He succeeds, then begins systematically undermining the President, causing the latter's effectiveness and popularity to plummet to the point where he resigns, allowing Underwood to assume the Presidency at the end of the series' second season. In season 4, Underwood is shot and temporarily incapacitated, leading to his Vice President, Donald Blythe, to become Acting President until Underwood finished healing. In Season 5, the Presidential election goes to the House of Representatives, but Frank's wife Claire Underwood is elected Vice President by the Senate before the House of Representatives can elect the President. Thus, Claire becomes Acting President in the interim until the Presidential election is resolved. * Jericho: nuclear bombs have destroyed some major cities in the United States, including Washington, D.C. In the episode \\"Black Jack,\\" it is revealed that six people have laid claim to the Presidency, each with a base in a \\"new capital city\\" unaffected by the attacks. These cities, as seen on a map and in newspaper articles, are Rome, New York; Montgomery, Alabama; Columbus, Ohio; San Antonio, Texas; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Sacramento, California. It is mentioned that fictional Secretary of Health and Human Services Charles would be next in line, suggesting that all those above him or her on the list are dead or incapacitated. However, \\"five other guys believe that the attacks have changed the rules,\\" including fictional Senators Morrissette, Tomarchio, and Snowden. * The Last Man on Earth: In this dark comedy series about a pandemic that wipes out almost all of humanity, the 2017 episode \\"Got Milk?\\" shows flashbacks of the progression of the disease, including news reports that President Mike Pence has died, followed in rapid succession by President Paul Ryan, President Rex Tillerson, President Steven Mnuchin, President Jeff Sessions, and President Betsy DeVos. * The Last Ship: When a global pandemic wipes out 80% of the world's population, most of the American leadership dies too. The President's death is followed a week later by his Vice President, who is succeeded by the Speaker of the House who takes charge of the remnants of the government from the White House bunker. When the bunker is somehow compromised by the virus and everyone inside is presumably killed, the only surviving cabinet member, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jeffrey Mitchener is sworn in as President of the United States in the new capital in St. Louis. He had also appointed St. Louis Mayor Howard Oliver as his Vice President. Upon Michener's death, Oliver was sworn in as President. * Madam Secretary: ** In the season two premiere, Secretary of State Elizabeth McCord becomes Acting President when President Conrad Dalton and the Speaker of House are on board Air Force One when it loses all communications ability and goes off radar. As Vice President Mark Delgado was undergoing emergency gallbladder surgery under anaesthetic and President pro tempore of the Senate Theodore Gates was deemed too mentally incompetent to take the oath of office due to a series of mini strokes six months prior which left him senile, McCord is the next in line. She is Acting President for a period of a few hours whilst contact with Air Force One is established and President Dalton is able to safely land and resume office. During her brief tenure, McCord uses her power to pardon Erica Davis, a journalist controversially imprisoned for refusing to reveal her sources. ** In a fourth-season episode, when the President's behavior has become erratic, his cabinet members give him a choice: he can voluntarily remove himself through Article 3 of the 25th Amendment and submit to a medical examination, or they will invoke Article 4 to force him to do so. He chooses the former, and Vice President Teresa Hurst becomes Acting President. * Political Animals: In the final episode of this 2012 miniseries, Air Force One crashes while on a trip to France. While rescue/recovery operations are underway, Vice President Collier prepares to take the oath of office. Secretary of State Barrish suggests that he instead invoke the 25th Amendment to become Acting President, to avoid a possible constitutional crisis in the unlikely event President Garcetti is found alive. Collier agrees. * Quantico (season 2): ** Henry Roarke succeeded by the Speaker of the House * Seven Days: In the pilot, the President and Vice President are both killed in a terrorist attack on the White House. On his way to be sworn in as President, the Speaker of the House is also killed. Using time-travel technology, the hero is able to go back in time one week and prevent the attack. * Scandal: ** In Season 1, Billy Chambers, chief of staff to Vice President Sally Langston, engineers an affair between President Fitzgerald Grant and a White House intern, intending to release evidence of the affair and force Grant's resignation so that Langston, who is unaware of Chambers' plot, will succeed to the office. Grant and his allies discredit Chambers, so that the evidence is not believed; Grant does not resign. ** In Season 2, President Grant is placed in a medically-induced coma after being shot. Vice President Langston and the Cabinet invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, making Langston Acting President. First Lady Mellie Grant disagrees with several of Langston's decisions, and she forges the President's written notice that he is able to resume the office. Langston detects the ruse and hopes to use it to claim the presidency, but President Grant genuinely recovers sufficiently to resume the office before Langston can take further action. ** Also in Season 2, Billy Chambers again tries to manipulate the presidential succession. Chambers obtains evidence that President Grant's supporters, without Grant's knowledge, tampered with voting machines to rig the presidential election in his favor. Chambers shares the evidence with the losing candidate, Maryland Governor Samuel Reston, who blackmails Grant into making him his \\"unity\\" running mate in his reelection campaign; Chambers plans to use the evidence to effect Grant's resignation or impeachment, resulting in Reston succeeding him. However, Grant only pretends to agree to Reston's demand; he never has to go through with it, as Chambers is again neutralized when his accomplice David Rosen instead uses the evidence for his own gain, and exposes crimes committed by Chambers. **In season 6, Frankie Vargas is elected president and is planned to succeed President Grant. However, President-Elect Vargas was assassinated at his election night victory speech. It was expected that Vice President-Elect Cyrus Beene would be elected president by the Electoral College. This did not happen because the assassination of the President-Elect was pinned on him and he was arrested. Later, it was found that Vargas's now-widowed wife Luna Vargas planned the assassination and blackmailed Olivia Pope's father Eli to kill President-Elect Vargas and pinned it on former Vice President-Elect Beene. Beene was later exonerated and let go. Cyrus did not become president though; Mellie Grant, the ex-wife of President Grant and the Republican Party nominee for president, was elected by the Electoral College as the first female president of the United States and Luna Vargas was elected vice president. After it was revealed that Luna Vargas assassinated her husband, Olivia and Jake Ballard forced her to commit suicide. President Mellie Grant selected Cyrus Beene to replace her and he became vice president, the first gay vice president in American history. * The West Wing: ** In the episode He Shall, from Time to Time..., Josh is instructed to \\"pick a guy\\" (referring to the designated survivor). Ultimately, Secretary of Agriculture Roger Tribbey is chosen; the episode closing with the President briefing him on damage control, and leaving him in the Oval Office as he leaves for the Capitol to deliver the State of the Union Address. ** In the first episode of the second season, entitled \\"In the Shadow of Two Gunmen, Part I\\" President Josiah Bartlet is incapacitated after being shot during an assassination attempt. While the Vice President believes he should act as President, Chief of Staff Leo McGarry argues that without a letter from Bartlet stating the incapacity, no one has the right to claim authority. The Cabinet does not invoke the 25th Amendment and the President recovers quickly enough to prevent a constitutional crisis, though reporters pursue these constitutional problems after the event. While in reality, the Vice President could assume the duties of the President without the President himself having to act, this provision does not exist in the fictional world. ** In the closing episodes of the fourth season, the President's daughter is kidnapped. Feeling that he is incapable of acting impartially or in the national interest, and wishing to diminish the kidnappers' leverage, President Bartlet invokes the 25th Amendment to temporarily relinquish the powers of the office. The Vice Presidency is vacant due to a recent scandal, so powers are transferred to the Speaker of the House, a conservative Republican and the ideological polar opposite of the President. There is further controversy as Acting President Walken threatens to select a new Vice President himself, when it is not clear if he has the authority to do so. The Constitutional crisis is averted when Bartlet resumes the powers of the Presidency by notifying the Congressional leaders as provided in the 25th Amendment. The Vice Presidency is later filled under the 25th Amendment by Bob Russell. ** In the last season of The West Wing, Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Leo McGarry dies on Election Day, and it is revealed in the final episode that President Santos intends to nominate his choice to replace him in the Vice Presidency under the 25th Amendment (thereby gaining the ratification of Congress) rather than appeal to the Electoral College to elect his new choice in place of McGarry. * Veep: ** In season one, Vice President Selina Meyer becomes Acting President when the unseen President is said to be experiencing chest pains. Believing that he is having a heart attack, Selina is brought to the West Wing where she discharges his presidential duties. It is later revealed, comically, that the President was suffering only heartburn, not a heart attack. ** In season three, the President faces potential impeachment proceedings after lying under oath about the presence of a spy in a group of rescued student hostages. As a result of their dire situation, and due to additional mental health issues, his wife (the First Lady) attempts suicide. Desiring to devote more time to taking care of her, he resigns, and Selina becomes President. She appoints Senator Andrew Doyle to be her Vice President. ** In season four, Selina narrowly wins her party's nomination for the Presidency, but Vice President Doyle later withdraws himself from the ticket. She selects former Senator Tom James as her running mate, but is faced with further difficulty when the general election results in a historic Electoral College tie. ** In season five, due to the Electoral College tie, the responsibility for selecting the President is placed in the hands of the House of Representatives, per the Twelfth Amendment. However, this results in another deadlock, with neither Selina nor her opponent, Senator Bill O'Brien, receiving enough votes. It is then up to the Senate to select the Vice President from among James or Senator Laura Montez, O'Brien's running mate. This also results in a 50‚Äì50 tie, which is broken by incumbent Vice President Doyle in his capacity as President of the Senate, who selects Montez in an act of revenge against Selina for rescinding her previous offer to nominate him for Secretary of State if she won. As the office of President is vacant due to the deadlock in the House, incoming Vice President Laura Montez immediately ascends to the Acting Presidency upon taking office, being sworn in as Acting President on Inauguration Day, set to serve until the House successfully elects a President; however, the Speaker of the House announced that no further vote in the House would be taking place. * Z Nation: This darkly comical series about the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse makes several references to the U.S. president. The first episode \\"Puppies and Kittens\\" refers to the recently deceased President Lindsay Barton, and the Season 4 episode \\"Mt. Weather\\" shows the characters reaching an emergency bunker and meeting President Jane Carlson (played by Ina Chang), who describes herself as 234th President of the United States, suggesting an extremely rapid run through the line of succession. Carlson was serving as Acting Secretary of Labor when she succeeded to the presidency after the death of President Bill Carney, who had retreated to the Mount Weather bunker with Carlson and others before dying there. It is unclear when Carney succeeded Barton. By the end of the episode Carlson herself is dead with no indication who, if anyone, is in a position to succeed her.

It is later revealed that Cardiff orchestrated the murder of the president, and he is found assassinated. His political rival, Senator Watts, then becames acting president. * Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty: U.S. President George Sears resigns his presidency after the existence of Metal Gear REX and the GENOME Army is revealed to the general public after the Shadow Moses Incident. His Vice President James Johnson succeeds him after a faux-election orchestrated by a secret organization known as The Patriots. * Hitman: Blood Money: To achieve a cloning ban, a secret society named Alpha Zerox attempts to assassinate President Tom Steward for Vice President Daniel Morris (in their employ) to replace him. Alpha Zerox also successfully kills the original Vice President, Spaulding Burke, for Daniel Morris to be selected by Congress as Vice President. When they believe a member of Steward's cabinet, Jimmy Mickley, may get the position, they attempt to assassinate him but fail. * Shattered Union: After a low-grade nuclear warhead obliterates Washington, D.C. during a presidential reelection inaugural ball, the President and the majority of Congress are killed, and the entire presidential line of succession is wiped out. This results in multiple state governors declaring home rule and regions of the United States becoming sovereign nations, one being the return of the Confederated States of America and the Republic of Texas. * Mass Effect 2: In 2184, President Christopher Huerta of the United North American States (created by the merger of the United States, Canada, and Mexico) suffers a severe stroke that renders him legally dead for 90 minutes; his mental functions were transferred to a computer system to keep them viable while his body is saved, then subsequently returned. Speaker of the House Lisa Ford files a lawsuit against Huerta the following year, arguing that his time in office after his stroke was illegitimate because he had been declared legally dead and that the Vice President should have succeeded him to the office. Expert testimony presented by Ford's side claimed that Huerta no longer existed and the computer system operating his memory was only presenting an interactive simulation of a thinking person. Huerta's side countered that he did not become a different person after being resuscitated and his life was only extended beyond what was thought possible at the time. The case is decided 5-4 in favor of Huerta and the legitimacy of his term is affirmed; this is met with widespread protests in Washington, Ottawa, and Mexico City by UNAS citizens against what they call a \\"zombie\\" president. * Fallout 76: After a global nuclear war erupts, Thomas Eckhart, Secretary of Agriculture, conspires to have all other Secretaries first-in-line of him killed at the Congressional Bunker. And with the actual President unable to be located after the war, Eckhart is left as the acting President of the remaining government forces in West Virginia.

The terms were used for native Austronesian ships in European records during the Colonial era indiscriminately, and thus can confusingly refer to the double-ended single- outrigger boats of Oceania, the double-outrigger boats of Island Southeast Asia, and sometimes ships with no outriggers or sails at all. In its most common usage, the term proa refers to the Pacific proas which consist of two (usually) unequal-length parallel hulls. It is sailed so that one hull is kept to windward, and the other to leeward. It is double-ended, since it needs to \\"shunt\\" to reverse direction when tacking. It is most famously used for the sakman ships of the Chamorro people of the Northern Marianas, which were known as the \\"flying proas\\" for their remarkable speed. In Island Southeast Asia, the term proa may also sometimes be used, but the terms perahu, prau, prahu, paraw and prow are more common. These differ from the Pacific proas in that they are not double-ended and have a trimaran configuration with two outriggers. These are widely used in the native ships of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and continue to be used today as traditional fishing, cargo, and transport vessels. Proas are traditionally rigged with the crab claw and tanja sails. The modern proa exists in a wide variety of forms, from the traditional archetype still common in areas described, to high-technology interpretations specifically designed for breaking speed-sailing records. Etymology The term \\"proa\\" originates from Early Modern English \\"prow\\" or \\"praw\\". It probably entered the English language via Dutch prauw and Portuguese parau, similar to Spanish proa, meaning \\"bow\\". It is likely ultimately derived from Malay perahu meaning \\"boat\\", from the Proto-Western- Malayo-Polynesian doublets *parahu and *padaw, both meaning \\"sailboat\\". Its cognates in other Austronesian languages include Javanese prau, Sundanese parahu, Kadazan padau, Maranao padaw, Cebuano par√°w, Ngadha barau, Kiribati baurua, Samoan folau, Hawaiian halau, and Maori wharau. History Map showing the migration and expansion of the Austronesians Austronesian boat (Mahdi, 1999) Catamarans and outrigger boats were very early innovations of the Austronesian peoples and were the first true ocean-going ships capable of crossing vast distances of water. This enabled the Austronesian peoples to rapidly spread from Taiwan and colonize the islands of both the Pacific and Indian oceans since at least 2200 BC. The first outriggers evolved from the more primitive double-hulled catamarans. There are two types of outrigger ships based on the number of outriggers: the single-outriggers (which include catamarans with unequal hulls) and the double-outriggers (sometimes called trimarans). Single-outriggers evolved first and are the dominant form of Austronesians ships in Oceania and Madagascar. They have largely been replaced by the more versatile double-outrigger ships in Island Southeast Asia. Double- outrigger forms, however, are absent entirely in Oceania. Catamaran and outrigger technologies were introduced by Austronesian traders from Southeast Asia to the Dravidian-speaking peoples of Sri Lanka and Southern India as early as 1000 to 600 BC. This is still evident in the terms for \\"boat\\" in Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada (pa·π≠avu, pa·∏çava, and pa·∏çahu, respectively), which are all cognates of Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian *padaw. Early contact by Austronesians with Arab sailors may have also influenced the development of the lateen sail in western ship traditions, derived from the more ancient Austronesian crab claw sail. Many of these traditional vessels are now extinct. Either lost during the colonial period or supplanted by in modern times by western boat designs or fitted with motor engines. Historical descriptions of the proa An illustration of a Philippine karakoa in Francisco Ignacio Alcina's Historia de las islas e indios de Bisayas (1668) The Portuguese were the first Europeans to encounter the double-outrigger Southeast Asian ships, initially with derivative vessels from the Malabar Coast, which they called the parau. They applied the same name to similar ships in their colonies in Southeast Asia. Similarly, the Dutch encountered them when they colonized the islands of Indonesia, calling them prauw. This was rendered as \\"praw\\" by the British, later evolving to \\"proa\\". In French territories in the Pacific Islands, they were known by the more general term pirogue. Although technically restricted to outrigger sailing vessels, European sources often applied the term indiscriminately to any native ships of Southeast Asia. A \\"piratical proa in full chase\\" in The Pirates Own Book (1837) by Charles Elims. Note the tanja sail and the absence of outriggers. Plan of a Micronesian \\"flying proa\\", from a 1742 sketch by Lt. Peircy Brett, an officer on Lord Anson's round-the-world voyage The earliest written accounts of the single-outrigger Pacific proa (though not by name) were by the Venetian scholar Antonio Pigafetta, who was part of Ferdinand Magellan's 1519‚Äì1522 circumnavigation. They encountered the native sakman ships of the Chamorro people in the Islas de los Ladrones (Mariana Islands). Pigafetta describes the outrigger layout of the sakman, and ability to switch bow for stern, and also notes its speed and maneuverability, noting, \\"And although the ships were under full sail, they passed between them and the small boats (fastened astern), very adroitly in those small boats of theirs.\\" Pigafetta likened the sakman to the Venetian fisolere, a narrow variety of gondola. A double-outrigger Indonesian jukung (c. 1970) with a crab claw sail. These were known by the Dutch as vlerkprauw (literally \\"wing prauw). It is one of the vessels known as \\"proas\\" in Island Southeast Asia The accounts of Magellan's crew were the first to describe the Chamorro proas as \\"flying.\\" The subsequent colonization of the Micronesia and the Philippines provided further references to proas in Spanish records. They also described double-outrigger ships from the Philippines, like the account of the karakoa in Francisco Ignacio Alcina's Historia de las islas e indios de Bisayas (1668) which describes them as \\"sailing like birds.\\" During his 1740‚Äì1744 circumnavigation, Lord Anson applied the term proa to the double-ended Micronesian single-outrigger ships. His fleet captured one in 1742, and Lt. Peircy Brett of made a detailed sketch of the proa. Rev. Richard Walter, chaplain of HMS Centurion, estimated the speed of the proa at twenty miles per hour (32 km/h). Although aware of earlier Spanish accounts of the boats of the Spanish East Indies, Anson's account was the first detailed description of a Pacific proa to the English- speaking world. In the subsequent voyages of James Cook in Polynesia, he referred to the similar native single-outrigger canoes there as \\"proes\\", differentiating them from the double-hulled catamarans which he called \\"pahee\\" (Tahitian pahi). These accounts fascinated both the British and American public, ushering in a period of interest in the design by sports sailors. Working from the drawings and descriptions of explorers, western builders often took liberties with the traditional designs, merging their interpretation of native designs with Western boat building methods. Thus this Western \\"proa\\" often diverged radically from the traditional \\"proa\\" to the point that the only shared feature was the windward/leeward hull arrangement. :The Proa darted like a shooting star :Lord Byron, \\"The Island\\", 1823 Modern variations A proa of the Bikini Islanders is loaded aboard LST 1108 on March 7, 1948, as the island's residents are relocated to Rongerik Atoll. In the Marshall Islands, where the craft were traditionally built, there has been a resurgence of interest in the proa. People hold annual kor-kor races in the lagoon at Majuro, along with events such as a children's riwut race. The kor- kors are built in traditional style out of traditional materials, though the sails are made with modern materials (often inexpensive polyethylene tarpaulins, commonly known as polytarp). A loose group of individuals from all over the world has formed from those interested in the proa, including people with a historical perspective and those with a scientific and engineering perspective. Many such individuals are members of the Amateur Yacht Research Society. Early Western proas In the late 19th century and early 20th century, many in Europe and America became interested in the proa. Western boat builders such as R. M. Munroe and Robert Barnwell Roosevelt (Theodore Roosevelt's uncle) reflected its influence. Into the 20th century, the proa was one of the fastest sailing craft that existed. The proa design is still the basis for many boats involved in speed sailing. The first well-documented Western version of the proa was built in 1898 by Commodore Ralph Middleton Munroe of the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club. Yacht-design giant Nathanael Herreshoff, a friend of Munroe, may have also had an interest in the project. A small model of the Anson-Brett proa is collected at the Herreshoff Marine Museum in Rhode Island; its maker is uncertain. Over the following years, Munroe built several more. They were all destroyed by the mid-1930s, when a severe hurricane leveled Munroe's bayside boatshop. At least two of his designs were documented in articles in The Rudder, as was one by Robert B. Roosevelt. Small proas may have been brought back to the United States in the late 19th century, but documentation is sparse. Munroe and Roosevelt appeared to be the first two builders to adapt the proa to Western building techniques. =Royal Mersey Yacht Club= In 1860 a member of the Royal Mersey Yacht Club in England built a copy of a Micronesian proa. He used the traditional asymmetric hull, flat on the lee side, and a decked dugout ama. While no quantitative record was made of its speed, it was noted that the proa would run at speeds that would bury the bows of any other vessel. It carried three times the ratio of sail area to immersed midships section than the fastest yachts in the club and yet drew only . =Munroe's 1898 proa= R. M. Munroe's 1898 proa Since Munroe had no direct experience with proas, all he had to work with was the widely distributed and incorrect plan drawing from about 1742, made during Admiral Lord Anson's circumnavigation of the globe. This drawing had been circulated in the press, for example in William Alden's articles in Harper's Magazine. (These were reprinted in a small book called The Canoe and the Flying Proa. This proa was one of several either captured or seen under sail when Anson stopped at Tinian during a Pacific crossing. Brett, the draughtsman of the plan, is thought by some to have misinterpreted one key element, showing the mast fixed vertically in the center of the boat. This view as based on the fact that other Micronesian proa masts were raked end-to- end as the vessel shunted and the fact that a raked mast shifts the center of effort of the sail which would influence helm balance. However, Brett's placing of the mast in a vertical position has found to be accurate when replicas of the \\"Anson\\" proa were built and sailed by the Marinas-based organization 500 Sails that found that in many points of sail under many conditions the proa sailed well with the mast in a vertical position.500 Sails Executive Director and Chamorro Proa Builder Pete Perez 500 Sails also found that the mast could be raked to advantage in many situations and noted that the mast step depicted in the \\"Anson\\" drawing could be interpreted as depicting a rotational point rather than a rigid mast step that would not allow raking. 500 Sails canoes employ rotational mast steps that allow mast raking. Munroe, however, was a talented boat designer who was able to work around any problems with the drawings. His adaptations can be seen in successive proas. Rather than the deep, asymmetric hull of a traditional proa, Munroe created flat-bottomed hulls (similar to the fisolera referred to by Pigafetta), with keels or centerboards for lateral resistance. His first iteration had an iron center fin with a half-oval profile. Rather than the traditional crab-claw sail's spars which meet at the front, Munroe's sails used what could be described as a triangular lug sail or spritsail with a boom, similar to the modern lateen sail with a shorter upper spar. Munroe's first proa was only long, yet was capable of speeds which Munroe estimated at . His article in The Rudder describes what can only be planing on the flat hull. As this was before the advent of planing power boats, this proa was one of the first boats capable of planing. This helped produce its amazing speed when most boats were limited to their hull speed‚Äîthey had too little power to achieve planing speed, and yet were not designed to exceed hull speed without planing. For example, a boat with too little power to plane, and with a hull form and displacement that didn't permit it to exceed hull speed without planing, would have a maximum speed of about ; Munroe's proa could reach nearly 2.5 times that speed. This accomplishment was the nautical equivalent to the X-1 breaking the sound barrier. It is not clear that traditional proas of the Pacific islanders could plane, though the long, slender hull would have a much higher speed/length ratio than other contemporary designs. Munroe was building a \\"cheap and dirty\\" sharpie hull made of two planks, a couple of bulkheads and a crossplanked bottom. By lucky accident he may have been the first sailor to plane his boat. \\"It planed although he didn't use that word because it hadn't been invented yet. I'm wondering if it was the first planing boat?\\" Jim Michalak =Roosevelt's Mary & Lamb= Robert Barnwell Roosevelt, uncle of American President Theodore Roosevelt, also built a proa at about the same time. He used it sailing from Long Island. It was significantly different but equally creative, and at , much longer. From his 1898 article in The Rudder, it appeared the main hull of Roosevelt's proa was an open wide scow hull; the ama was a smaller, fully decked scow which looked like it could rock on a single aka. The mast was a bipod arrangement with both masts stepped to windward, with a boomed, balanced lugsail suspended from the apex. A balanced rudder at each end managed itself by pivoting 180¬∞ when its end was the \\"bow\\", and leeboards were used. Roosevelt's short article is accompanied by photographs showing his proa Mary & Lamb, at rest and under sail. It is not clear if the boat predated Munroe's 1898 proa. =Munroe's 1900 Proa= R. M. Munroe's 1900 proa Since Munroe wasn't aware of the raking mast, his 1900 model used two daggerboards set fore and aft of the mast, which would allow adjustment of the center of lateral resistance to provide helm balance. From the drawings, it appears the mast is higher as well, allowing a larger sail. The sail design also changed, with the upper spar now being slightly longer than the upper edge of the sail, and projecting past the apex slightly to allow the apex to be attached to the hull. The sail was loose footed, with the boom attached to the upper spar near the sail apex, and to the clew of the sail. His article in a 1900 issue of The Rudder included more details on the construction of his second proa. A 1948 book of sailboat plans published by The Rudder includes the following specifications for the 1900 proa: * Length overall * Beam (of main hull) * Draft of hull about * Draft with boards down * Sail area From the drawings, the distance from the center of the main hull to the center of the aka is about . Other Western interpretations Western designers often feel the need to tinker with the proa. They are attracted by the minimalist nature and amazing speeds that proas are capable of (they may still be the fastest sailboats per dollar spent for the home builder) but they often want the proa to do more; adding cabins, different sailing rigs, and bidirectional rudders are common changes made. James Wharram was greatly influenced by the Proa design. For example, unconventional boat and yacht designer Phil Bolger drew at least three proa designs; the smallest one (20 ft) has been built by several people while the larger two, including his Proa 60, have not been built. For additional examples, see here. =Lee pods= Diagram of a proa with a lee pod The terms ama and aka have been adopted for the modern trimaran. Since trimarans are generally designed to sail with one ama out of the water, they are similar to an Atlantic proa, with the buoyant leeward ama providing the bulk of the stability for the long, relatively thin main hull. Some modern proa designers have borrowed trimaran design elements for use in proas. Trimarans often have main hulls that are very narrow at the waterline, and flare out and extend over a significant portion of the akas. This topheavy design is only practical in a multihull, and it has been adapted by some proa designers. Notable examples are the designs of Russell Brown, a boat-fittings maker who designed and built his first proa, Jzero, in the mid-1970s. He has created a number of proa designs, all of which follow the same theme. One of the design elements which Brown used, and a number of other designers have copied, is the lee pod. The akas extend past the main hull and out to the lee side, and provide support for a cabin extending to the lee of the main hull. This is similar to the platform extending to the lee on some Micronesian proas. The lee pod serves two purposes‚Äîit can be used for bunk space or storage, and it provides additional buoyancy on the lee side to prevent a capsize should the boat heel too far. Crew can also be moved onto the lee pod to provide additional heeling force in light winds, allowing the ama to lift under circumstances when it would not otherwise. The Jzero also used water ballast in the ama to allow the righting moment to be significantly increased if needed. While Brown's proa was designed to be a cruising yacht, not a speed-sailing boat, the newer Jzero is capable of speeds of up to . =Sail rigs= One of the issues Western designers have with the proa is the need to manipulate the sail when shunting. Even Munroe's early sails discarded the curved yards of the traditional crabclaw for the more familiar straight yards of the lateen and lug sails. Munroe's designs likely lacked the tilting mast because he was unaware of it, but many designers since have use a fixed mast, and provided some other way of adjusting the center of effort. Most sailboats are designed with the center of effort of the sails slightly ahead of the center of area of the underwater plane; this difference is called \\"lead.\\" In a proa hull, and in all fore and aft symmetric foils, the center of resistance is not at or even near the center of the boat, it is well forward of the geometric center of area. Thus the center of effort of the sails needs to also be well forward, or at least needs to have a sail which is well forward which can be sheeted in to start the boat moving, allowing the rudders to bite and keep the boat from heading up when the entire sail area is sheeted in. Jzero, for example, and all of Russell Brown's other designs, use a sloop rig and hoist a jib on whichever end is the current \\"bow\\". Other designs use a schooner rig for the same effect. One of the more practical rigs for small proas was invented by Euell Gibbons around 1950 for a small, single handed proa. This rig was a loose footed lateen sail hung from a centered mast. The sail was symmetric across the yard, and to shunt, what was previously the top end of the yard was lowered and became the bottom end, reversing the direction of the sail. Proa enthusiast Gary Dierking modified this design further, using a curved yard and a boom perpendicular to the yard. This allows a greater control of the sail shape than the traditional Gibbons rig, while retaining the simple shunting method, and is often referred to as the Gibbons/Dierking rig. =Foils= While a proa is fairly efficient at minimizing the amount of wave drag and maximizing stability, there is at least one way to go even further. The use of underwater foils to provide lift or downforce has been a popular idea recently in cutting-edge yacht building, and the proa is not immune to this influence. The Bruce foil is a foil that provides a lateral resistance with zero heeling moment by placing the foil to either or both of the leeward and the windward sides, angled so the direction of the force passes through the center of effort of the sail. Since proas already have an outrigger to the windward side, a simple angled foil mounted on the ama becomes a Bruce foil, making the already stable proa even more stable. Bruce foils are often combined with inclined rigs, which results in a total cancellation of heeling forces. Inclined rigs are also well suited to the proa, as the direction of incline remains constant during shunting. Another use of foils is to provide lift, turning the boat into a hydrofoil. Hydrofoils require significant speeds to work, but once the hull is lifted out of the water, the drag is significantly reduced. Many speed sailing designs have been based on a proa type configuration equipped with lifting foils. =Variations on the theme= The layout of the record-making Yellow Pages Endeavour. Commonly described as a trimaran, due to the three hulls, its layout is that of a unidirectional proa, as the trailing lee hull follows in the leading hull's wake. In a non-traditional variant, first seen among Western yacht racers, the \\"Atlantic proa\\" has an ama which is always to the lee side to provide buoyancy for stability, rather than ballast as in a traditional proa. Because the Atlantic ama is at least as long as the main hull, to reduce wave drag, this style can also be thought of as an asymmetric catamaran that shunts rather than tacking. The first Atlantic proa was the Cheers, designed in 1968 by boat designer Dick Newick for the 1968 OSTAR solo translatlantic race, in which it placed third. Newkirk's designs are primarily trimarans, and the Atlantic proa's buoyant outrigger follows naturally from a conversion of a trimaran from a tacking to a shunting vessel. Other proa designers blur the lines between Atlantic and Pacific style proas. The Harryproa from Australia uses a long, thin hull to lee, and a short, fat hull, containing the cabin, to windward. This would normally be more like an Atlantic proa, but the rig is on the lee hull, leaving it technically a Pacific design. This and other similar proas place the bulk of the passenger accommodations on the ama, in an attempt to make the vaka as streamlined as possible, and put much of the mass in the lee side to provide a greater righting moment. Perhaps the most extreme variants of the proa are the ones designed for pure speed. These often completely discard symmetry, and are designed to sail only in one direction relative to the wind; performance in the other direction is either seriously compromised or impossible. These are \\"one way\\" proas, such as world record speed holding Yellow Pages Endeavour, or YPE. While the YPE is often called a trimaran, it would be more correct to call it a Pacific proa, because two of the planing/hydrofoil hulls are in line. This design has been considered by others as well, such as the Monomaran designs by \\"The 40 knot Sailboat\\" author Bernard Smith, and these designs been called 3-point proas by some, a reference to the 3 point hulls used in hydroplanes. A previous record holding design, the Crossbow II, owned by Timothy Colman was a proa/catamaran hybrid. Crossbow II was a \\"slewing\\" catamaran, able to slew her hulls to allow clear airflow to her leeward bipod sail. Although the hulls appeared identical, the boat had all crew and controls, cockpit etc. in her windward hull; the leeward hull was stripped bare for minimal weight. Speed records In March 2009, two new sailing speed records were set by vehicles based on the proa concept, one on land, and one on the water. On March 26, 2009, Simon McKeon and Tim Daddo set a new C-class speed sailing record of over 500 meters in the Macquarie Innovation, successor to their previous record holding Yellow Pages Endeavour, with a peak speed of . The record was set in winds of 22 to , and came close to taking the absolute speed record on water, currently held by l'Hydropt√®re. Conditions during the record-setting run were less than ideal for the Maquarie Innovation, which is anticipated to have a top speed of ‚Äì . On March 27, 2009, Richard Jenkins set a world wind-powered speed record, on land, of 126.1 miles per hour (202.9 km/h) in the Ecotricity Greenbird. This broke the previous record by 10 miles per hour (16 km/h). The Greenbird is based on a one-way proa design, with a long, thin two-wheeled body with a third wheel to the lee acting as an ama. The aka, which is in the shape of a wing, provides a significant amount of downwards force at speed to counter the heeling force generated by the high-aspect wing sail.

According to Freud, the anus is the primary erogenous zone and pleasure is derived from controlling bladder and bowel movement. The major conflict issue during this stage is toilet training. A fixation at this stage can result in a personality that is too rigid or one that is too disordered. According to Freud's theory, personality developed through a series of stages throughout childhood. These stages are focused on erogenous areas. Freud believed in the libido, which he referred to as psychosexual energy. To Freud, the libido was the driving force behind all of human behavior. In order to obtain a healthy personality later on in adulthood all of these stages need to be completed successfully. If issues are not resolved in a stage then fixation will occur resulting in an unhealthy personality. In general The anal stage, in Freudian psychology, is the period of human development occurring at about one to three years of age. Around this age, the child begins to toilet train, which brings about the child's fascination in the erogenous zone of the anus. The erogenous zone is focused on the bowel and bladder control. Therefore, Freud believed that the libido was mainly focused on controlling the bladder and bowel movements. The anal stage coincides with the start of the child's ability to control their anal sphincter, and therefore their ability to pass or withhold feces at will. If the children during this stage can overcome the conflict it will result in a sense of accomplishment and independence. Conflict This is the second stage of Freud's psychosexual stages. This stage represents a conflict with the id, ego, and superego. The child is approached with this conflict with the parent's demands. A successful completion of this stage depends on how the parents interact with the child while toilet training. If a parent praises the child and gives rewards for using the toilet properly and at the right times then the child will successfully go through the stage. However, if a parent ridicules and punishes a child while they are at this stage, the child can respond in negative ways. Parents' role As mentioned before the ability for the children to be successful in this stage is solely dependent upon their parents and the approach they use towards toilet training. Freud believed that parents should promote the use of toilet training with praise and rewards. The use of positive reinforcement after using the toilet at the appropriate times encourages positive outcomes. This will help reinforce the feeling that the child is capable of controlling their bladder. The parents help make the outcome of this stage a positive experience which in turn will lead to a competent, productive, and creative adult. This stage is also important in the child's future relationships with authority. According to Freud's Psychosexual Theory, parents need to be very careful in how they react to their children during this sensitive stage. During this stage children test their parents, the authority figures, on how much power they really have as opposed to how much room the child has to make his or her own decisions. Anal-retentive personality The (-ve) negative reactions from their parents, such as early or harsh toilet training, can lead the child to become an anal-retentive personality. If the parents tried forcing the child to learn to control their bowel movements, the child may react by deliberately holding back in rebellion. They will form into an adult who hates mess, is obsessively tidy, punctual, and respectful to authority. These adults can sometimes be stubborn and be very careful with their money. Anal-expulsive personality The opposite of these adults would be anal expulsive adults. Such adults underwent liberal toilet training as opposed to the above reaction. These adults, as children, usually relieved themselves at inappropriate times. As children, they soiled their pants whenever they pleased in rebellion against using the toilet. They did not like to be ordered how and when they should use the toilet. These adults will want to share things with their peers and give things away. They can sometimes be messy, disorganized, and rebellious. They will also be inconsiderate of others' feelings. However, a child who has successfully completed this stage will be characterized as having used proper toilet training techniques throughout toilet training years and will successfully move on to the next stage of Freud's psychosexual developmental stages. Although the anal stage seems to be about proper toilet training, it is also about controlling behaviors and urges. A child needs to learn certain boundaries when he or she is young so that in the future there will not be contention regarding what is overstepping the boundaries. Related to cognitive psychology According to the field of cognitive psychology, Freud's anal stage falls into the category of internal mental states. These internal mental states are referring to belief, idea, motivation and knowledge. Freud revolves the basis of his stages around these main ideas as well. The result of whether a child completes this stage successfully or becomes fixated has a lot to do with the child's knowledge of their past with their toilet training experience, the motivation they received from the parents during the stage and the child's own belief in how they should react to the situation. Cognitive psychology also focuses on and studies how people perceive, remember and learn their surroundings, environment, and experiences. These are the three main reasons why a child will become either anal-retentive or anal-expulsive after childhood.

As the gravity knife requires gravity or spinning motion to propel the blade out of the handle, it differs fundamentally from the switchblade, which opens its spring-propelled blade automatically upon the push of a button, switch, or fulcrum lever. The main purpose of this opening method is that it allows opening and closing to be done one handed, in situations where the other hand is occupied. A major historical use has been in issue to parachutists to cut off their parachutes when tangled in a tree or in similar situations. The gravity knife uses a button, trigger, or fulcrum lever to release the blade from both the open and the closed positions, and may use a side-folding or telescoping (out-the- front, or OTF) blade. While most military gravity knives utilize a locking blade design, other types may not mechanically lock open but rely instead upon friction to wedge the rear section of the blade against the interior of the handle. Factory-made gravity knives have various types of buttons, triggers, and fulcrum levers, which usually are used to release the blade from both the open and the closed positions. Design and operation =Flieger-Kappmesser / Luftwaffe Gravity Knife (LGK)= German Luftwaffe Fallschirmj√§ger-Messer or air force paratrooper knife One of the most recognizable gravity knives is the World War II-era Flieger-Kappmesser (literally: \\"flyers-cutting knife\\"), which utilizes a four-inch (100 mm) telescoping (OTF), gravity-propelled locking blade. First produced in 1937, the often so called Fallschirmj√§germesser was initially issued to German flight crews and paratroops, primarily for the purpose of cutting a trapped parachutist from his rigging in case he landed with a tangled parachute, or became entangled in trees or in the water with the shroud lines. The spike was used to untie knots while packing the parachutes. Luftwaffe air crew members used the knife to cut themselves out of their harnesses or cut through the aluminum hull of the aircraft after a crash landing. Though not intended for use as a fighting knife in the first place, the LGK was introduced to the 1st Skij√§ger Division and SS units on the Eastern Front to be used primarily as a close combat weapon from 1944 on. The Flieger-Kappmesser uses a sliding blade inside a metal gripframe, which was originally fitted with smooth wood scales. The blade itself is a relatively blunt spear-point, and the profile is flat ground, tapering to a utility edge. To open the blade, the user points the knife downwards while flipping up the fulcrum-style operating lever, allowing gravity to draw out the blade to its fullest extent. Releasing the lever locks the blade into position. The LGK may also be opened by flipping the blade release lever while flicking the wrist holding the knife, causing the blade to extend. The LGK was also equipped with a folding marlinspike or awl. Primarily intended for untangling rope knots, it was also used as a prying tool or to fix jammed weapons. The spike does not lock when opened and was never intended to be used as a combat weapon. There are two principal types of wartime-era Flieger-Kappmesser with altogether 10 known variations. The Type I LGK (three manufacturers, five WWII variations) has wood scales (handle), was made from 1937-1943, and unlike successive models, has no 'takedown' capability. The Type II LGK (two manufacturers, five WWII variations) is the same knife, but with takedown features, and was produced from 1943 until 1945 and then again from ca. 1950 until 1965. After the end of World War II, the newly organized West German Bundeswehr placed new orders with German cutlery manufacturers for a postwar version of the Kappmesser for issue to the Army¬¥s airborne forces and tank crews. The West German Luftwaffe abandoned the gravity knife concept completely and purchased completely different rescue knives including a shroud line cutter. The initial Type III \\"trap door\\" gravity knife, made from 1955-1961 did not prove to be very reliable and thus, the original WWII Type II design was reintroduced until it was finally replaced by the early Type IV knives in appr. 1968. The Type IV LGK, is very similar to the WWII-production Type II takedown knife, but features plastic polymer instead of wooden scales and was made by WMF, OFW and Eickhorn from 1972-1984. They were issued to the Bundeswehr soldiers until 2017. The third West German post-war model is the Type V LGK, initially named AES79 and still today produced under the designation LL80 (1979‚Äìpresent) by Eickhorn. The LL80 is smaller, has fewer parts and is more cost-effective to produce than earlier Flieger-Kappmesser.Pattarozzi, Mack A. (2006), Luftwaffe Gravity Knife: A History And Analysis of the Flyer's And Paratrooper's Utility Knife, Schiffer Publishing, , : 'Takedown' refers to the knife's capability of being quickly disassembled into its component parts without tools. It was procured by the Swiss Air Force and issued to their Dassault Mirage pilots in 1983. These knives are marked AES83 and bear the number of the aircraft of the metal head. On the other side of the Iron Curtain, in the German Democratic Republic, WWII Gravity Knives were refurbished and re-issued to the paratroopers and pilots until the existing stock was gone. In the early 1960s two companies then produced an East German Version of the Type I knives. They were then used until the early 1970s. =Ibberson gravity knife= After British forces had captured numbers of Type I Flieger-Kappmesser, the British government approached George Ibberson & Co. of Sheffield, England, a knife and cutlery manufacturer, and requested production of a British version of the German Luftwaffe Gravity Knife for the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and other clandestine warfare units.Ladd, James D., Melton, Keith, and Mason, Peter, Clandestine warfare: weapons and equipment of the SOE and OSS, London: Blandford, , (1988), p. 29: These British SOE gravity knives are NOT the same knives as the standard British Army soldier's and sailor's clasp pocketknife, which featured a short, thick marlinspike. Under the initial wartime contract, George Ibberson & Co. made 500 gravity knives for issue to the SOE and other special forces. These Sheffield gravity knives had smooth wood or textured plastic scales, but were otherwise identical in features and operation to the Type I Flieger-Kappmesser, with a locking gravity-deployed blade and a folding rigging spike or awl. In the hands of British SOE agents, the Sheffield gravity knife was considered to be a secondary combat weapon. In addition to the knife blade, SOE close combat instructors found that the folding rigging spike was useful for silent killing of sentries by opening the carotid artery on the neck.Thompson, Leroy, Survival/Fighting Knives, Paladin Press, , 9780873643474 (1985), p. 76 ='False gravity' and non-gravity knives= Some folding or telescoping knives that can open their blades by force of inertia or gravity were not intended or advertised by the manufacturer to do so. Knives that will lock their blades open, but do not have any closed position lock device are referred to as \\"false\\" gravity blades. Folding \\"false\\" gravity knife The illustration shows the internal parts of a 1960s Japanese import 'false' gravity knife. Other knives may be considered to be 'false' gravity knives, including certain lock-back and linerlock folding knives that will not lock a blade in both open and closed positions. After the passage of the Switchblade Knife Act in the U.S. in 1958, it was discovered that some U.S. businesses were importing folding stiletto knives without spring mechanisms that did not have a pronounced blade heel (internal surface) in the pivot area allowing the longer 11 and 13 inch-bladed models to easily flick open. Modern (post 1965) folding stilettos imported or distributed in the U.S. now have blade heels that are intentionally pointed and ratchet against the lockback mechanism, preventing inertia opening. Other knives commonly mistaken for gravity knives include the automatic OTF knife, the switchblade and the butterfly knife (or balisong), the sliding knife, penny knife, and occasionally even common folding hunting knives such as the Buck 110 Folding Hunter. =Other= Conversion knife The 'conversion' gravity knife consists of a standard folding knife fitted with after-market modifications. The knife pictured does not lock closed, and is thus classed as a 'false' gravity knife. It can still be opened manually without touching the toggle switch. The addition of the toggle, which is attached to an internal bellcrank-arm, will lift the lockback mechanism to allow the blade to swing more easily. Legality In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and in certain U.S. states, a gravity knife is defined under the law as a prohibited weapon, with attendant criminal penalties. Other laws may criminalize the ownership, sale, importation, or carrying of a gravity knife upon one's person, either concealed or unconcealed. In the United States, some state criminal codes prohibit either the ownership or the carrying of gravity knives, either by name or by including a functional description of their opening mechanisms. Other state criminal codes bar gravity knives by redefining them variously as switchblades or balisongs (butterfly knives).Nappen, Evan(2003), \\"Are Switchblades Sporting Knives\\", Sporting Knives 2003: 60-65, Local jurisdictions including cities and counties may also restrict the ownership or carrying of gravity knives. In a few jurisdictions, such as Colorado and New York City, courts have periodically attempted to classify ordinary lock-blade folding knives with a blade that may be opened by centrifugal force (normally, using a flicking motion of the wrist) as a gravity knife, thus making the knife's owner subject to the same criminal penalties imposed for illegal possession of a gravity knife.Kertzman, Joe, Sporting Knives: Folders, Fixed Blades, Pocket, Military, Gent's Knives, Multi-Tools, Swords, Krause Publications, , 9780873494304 (2002), pp. 60-62 The New York statute banning gravity knives has been declared \\"unconstitutionally vague\\" by a federal District Court in March 2019. New York State legalized the possession of gravity knives on May 30, 2019 but New York City retains its ban on possession while on a subway or bus. Cultural references In the 1984 film Red Dawn, after the Wolverines attack a Soviet tank at a gas station, the tank commander pulls out what appears to be a gravity knife. He opens it with one hand, in a whipping motion, intent on using it to attack the character Toni Mason (Jennifer Grey).

Tagore was a prolific composer with around 2,232(approximately) songs to his credit. The songs have distinctive characteristics in the music of Bengal, popular in India and Bangladesh.Dance accompanied by Rabindra Sangeet It is characterised by its distinctive rendition while singing which includes a significant amount of ornamentation like meend, murki, etc. and is filled with expressions of romanticism. The music is mostly based on Hindustani classical music, Carnatic Classical Music, Western tunes and the inherent Folk music of Bengal and inherently possess within them, a near perfect balance, an endearing economy of poetry and musicality. Lyrics and music both hold almost equal importance in Rabindra Sangeet. Tagore created some six new taals (Which were actually inspired by Carnatic Talas) because he felt the traditional taals existing at the time could not do justice and were coming in the way of the seamless narrative of the lyrics.  History Rabindra Sangeet merges fluidly into Tagore's literature, most of which‚Äîpoems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike‚Äîwere lyricised. Influenced by the thumri style of Hindustani music, they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions. They emulated the tonal color of classical ragas to varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga's melody and rhythm faithfully; others newly blended elements of different ragas. Yet about nine-tenths of his work was not bhanga gaan, the body of tunes revamped with \\"fresh value\\" from select Western, Hindustani, Bengali folk and other regional flavours \\"external\\" to Tagore's own ancestral culture. In fact, Tagore drew influence from sources as diverse as traditional Hindusthani Thumri (\\"O Miya Bejanewale\\") to Scottish ballads (\\"Purano Shei Diner Kotha\\" from \\"Auld Lang Syne\\"). Scholars have attempted to gauge the emotive force and range of Hindustani ragas: Tagore influenced sitar maestro Vilayat Khan and sarodiyas Buddhadev Dasgupta and Amjad Ali Khan. His songs are widely popular and undergird the Bengali ethos to an extent perhaps rivalling Shakespeare's impact on the English-speaking world. It is said that his songs are the outcome of five centuries of Bengali literary churning and communal yearning. Dhan Gopal Mukerji has said that these songs transcend the mundane to the aesthetic and express all ranges and categories of human emotion. The poet gave voice to all‚Äîbig or small, rich or poor. The poor Ganges boatman and the rich landlord air their emotions in them. They birthed a distinctive school of music whose practitioners can be fiercely traditional: novel interpretations have drawn severe censure in both West Bengal and Bangladesh. For Bengalis, the songs' appeal, stemming from the combination of emotive strength and beauty described as surpassing even Tagore's poetry, was such that the Modern Review observed that \\"[t]here is in Bengal no cultured home where Rabindranath's songs are not sung or at least attempted to be sung ... Even illiterate villagers sing his songs\\". A. H. Fox Strangways of The Observer introduced non-Bengalis to rabindrasangit in The Music of Hindostan, calling it a \\"vehicle of a personality ... [that] go behind this or that system of music to that beauty of sound which all systems put out their hands to seize.\\" In 1971, Amar Shonar Bangla became the national anthem of Bangladesh. It was written‚Äîironically‚Äîto protest the 1905 Partition of Bengal along communal lines: lopping Muslim-majority East Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was to avert a regional bloodbath. Tagore saw the partition as a ploy to upend the independence movement, and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar communalism. Jana Gana Mana was written in shadhu-bhasha, a Sanskritised register of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of a Brahmo hymn that Tagore composed. It was first sung in 1911 at a Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress and was adopted in 1950 by the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of India as its national anthem.  Songs  His songs are affectionately called Rabindra Sangeet, and cover topics from humanism, structuralism, introspection, psychology, romance, yearning, nostalgia, reflection, modernism. Tagore primarily worked with two subjects ‚Äì first, the human being, the being and the becoming of that human being, and second, Nature, in all her myriad forms and colours, and of the relationship between the human being and Nature and how Nature affects the behavior and the expressions of human beings. Bhanusimha Thakurer Padavali (or Bhanusingher Podaboli), one of Tagore's earliest works in music, was primarily in a language that is similar and yet different from Bengali ‚Äì this language, Brajabuli, was derived from the language of the Vaishnav hymns, and of texts like Jayadeva's Gita Govinda, some influences from Sanskrit can be found, courtesy Tagore's extensive homeschooling in the Puranas, the Upanishads, as well as in poetic texts like Kalidasa's Meghad≈´ta and Abhigyanam Shakuntalam. Tagore was one of the greatest narrators of all time, and throughout his life, we find a current of narration through all his works that surges with upheavals in the psyche of the people around him, as well as with the changes of seasons. A master of metaphor, it is often difficult to identify the true meaning that underlies his texts, but what is truly great about Tagore, is that his songs are identifiable with any and every possible mood, with every possible situation that is encountered by a person in the course of life. This truly reinforces the notion that Rabindrasangeet has at its heart some unbelievably powerful poetry. The Upanishads influenced his writing throughout his life, and his devotional music is addressed almost always to an inanimate entity, a personal, a private god, whom modernists call the Other. Rabindranath Tagore was a curator of melodic and compositional styles. In the course of his travels all over the world, he came into contact with the musical narratives of the West, of the South of India, and these styles are reflected in some of his songs. There are several classifications of his work. The ones that beginners most often use is that based on genre ‚Äì devotional (Puja Porjaay), romantic (Prem Porjaay) [Note: It often becomes difficult, if not impossible, on hearing a song, to determine if it falls in the devotional genre or the romantic. The line between the two is blurred, by certain creations of Tagore himself, e.g. Tomarei Koriyachi Jibonero Dhrubotara. Also, Tagore never made these divisions. Only after his death was the need felt to categorize, compile and thus preserve his work, and the genre-classification system was born out of this need.] seasonal (Prokriti Porjaay) ‚Äì summer (Grishho), monsoon (Borsha), autumn (Shorot), early winter (Hemonto), winter (Sheet), Spring (Boshonto); diverse (Bichitro), patriotic (Deshatmobodhok). Although Deshatmobodh and patriotism are completely antipodal concepts, yet the difficulties of translation present themselves, apart from songs specified for certain events or occasions (Aanushtthanik) and the songs he composed for his numerous plays and dance-dramas.  Collections  The book forming a collection of all 2,233 songs written by Rabindranath is called Gitabitan (\\"Garden of songs\\") and forms an important part of extant historical materials pertaining to Bengali musical expression. The six major parts of this book are Puja (worship), Prem (love), Prakriti (seasons), Swadesh (patriotism), Aanushthanik (occasion-specific), Bichitro (miscellaneous) and Nrityonatya (dance dramas and lyrical plays). The Swarabitan, published in 64 volumes, includes the texts of 1,721 songs and their musical notation. The volumes were first published between 1936 and 1955. Earlier collections, all arranged chronologically, include Rabi Chhaya (1885), Ganer Bahi o Valmiki Pratibha (1893), Gan (1908), and Dharmashongit (1909).  Historical influence  Rabindra Sangeet has been an integral part of Bengal culture for over a century. Hindu monk and Indian social reformer Swami Vivekananda became an admirer of Rabindra Sangeet in his youth. He composed music in the Rabindra Sangeet style, for example Gaganer Thale in Raga Jaijaivanti. Many of Tagore's songs form the worship hymnal and hymns in many Churches in Kolkata and West Bengal.

There is no fish that is completely reef safe. Every fish that is commonly listed as reef safe are species that usually do not readily consume small fish or invertebrates. Fish listed as reef safe also do not bother fellow fish unless in some cases, for instance tangs, they do not get along with conspecifics and sometimes fish with similar color or body shape. Every fish has a personality, is different, and, in some cases, are opportunistic feeders. Tangs, which by most accounts are reef safe, may in adulthood eat some crustaceans shortly after they molt. Many larger predatory fish, for instance eels and pufferfish, will adapt very well to a reef tank and will be problem-free as long as they have sizable tank-mates and no crustaceans. Some aquarists have also had success in keeping smaller fish with predatory ones in reef tanks by adding the smaller fish at night, sometimes with newly rearranged rockwork.

He was most notable for a detailed diary he kept from 1828 until the time of his death in 1851, which is said to be the most extensive and detailed on the first half of 19th-century America. Early life Hone was born in New York City on October 25, 1780. He was the son of Philip Hone (1743‚Äì1798), a German immigrant carpenter, and Esther (n√©e Bourdet) Hone (1742‚Äì1798). Career Hone first began working in the auction business, which made him wealthy. He was also a successful merchant and a founder of the Mercantile Library Association and he was the first president of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company in 1825 and 1826. He became a man of great prominence in New York society for his wealth, sophistication, extensive travel and good taste, and was good friends with most of the political, artistic and scientific leaders of his day. Most notable among them were: Washington Irving, Samuel Morse, Daniel Webster, John Jacob Astor and U.S. Presidents John Quincy Adams and Martin Van Buren. Hone's diary records not only his society engagements and the major events and spectacles in the city in the first half of the century, but also his view of a changing city: his disapproval of Andrew Jackson; the disconcerting effects of the city's constant construction; and his utter disgust with most Irish immigrants. In 1827, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician. Hone lived in an elegant town house at 235 Broadway, opposite City Hall Park. The site was later one of those purchased by F. W. Woolworth for construction of the Woolworth Building. =Political career= Originally a Federalist, he was elected mayor in 1826 and served one term. He later became active in the Whig Party. During the Zachary Taylor administration, he served as Naval Officer of the Port of New York. Personal life Hone was married to Catharine Dunscomb (1778‚Äì1850), the daughter of Daniel and Margaret Dunscomb. Catherine's sister, Margaret Bradford Dunscomb, was married to Robert Swartwout, the military officer, merchant, alderman, and Navy agent. Together, they were the parents of: * Robert Swartwout Hone (1815‚Äì1898) * Mary S. Hone (1814‚Äì1840), who married John Jones Schermerhorn (1806‚Äì1876), the son of Peter Schermerhorn and brother of William Colford Schermerhorn, in 1832. Hone died in New York City on May 5, 1851. He was buried at Saint Mark's Church in-the-Bowery. =Legacy= Honesdale, Pennsylvania, is named in honor of Philip Hone, as is Hone Avenue in the Bronx.

(Accession #2003.177) Pichhwai (also pichhavai, pichhvai, pechhavai etc) are large devotional Hindu painted pictures, normally on cloth, which portray Krishna. They are mainly made to hang in Hindu temples of the Pushtimarg devotional tradition, especially the Shrinathji Temple in Nathdwara, Rajasthan, built around 1672. They are hung behind the idol of Shrinathji, a local form of Krishna and the centre of Pushtimarg worship, to depict his leelas. Aurangabad was another area associated with them.Blurton, 142-143; Harle, 393 The purpose of Pichhwais, other than artistic appeal, is to narrate tales of Krishna to the illiterate. Temples have sets with different images, which are changed according to the calendar of festivals celebrating the deity.Blurton, 142-143 The word Pichhwai stands for hanging at the back (Sanskrit word \\"Pichh\\" means back and \\"wais\\" means hanging). Nathdwara painting covers these and similar works in other genres, especially Indian miniature paintings. Like the Pushtimarg tradition, they originated in the Deccan, but are now mainly associated with Western India. Modern production Pichhwai have become the main export of Nathdwara and are in much demand among foreign visitors. The artists live mostly in Chitron ki gali (Street of paintings) and Chitrakaron ka mohallah (colony of painters) and make a close community with constant interaction. Often a Pichhwai painting is a group effort, where several skilful painters work together under the supervision of a master artist.

It commemorates the early days of the City of San Diego and includes many historic buildings from the period 1820 to 1870. The park was established in 1968.San Diego Historical Society: Old Town State Historic Park In 2005 and 2006, California State Parks listed Old Town San Diego as the most visited state park in California. In 1969, the site was registered as California Historical Landmark #830. Then on September 3, 1971, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Old Town San Diego Historic District. History The first European settlement on the West Coast of the present-day United States was the San Diego Presidio, a military outpost of Spanish California, founded by Gaspar de Portol√† in 1769. Mission San Diego de Alcal√° was founded by Father Jun√≠pero Serra the same year. The Presidio and Mission were originally built on a bluff above the San Diego River, Presidio Hill, which is now the site of the city-owned Presidio Park and which is immediately adjacent to Old Town State Historic Park. After five years the Mission moved to a location several miles upriver at the present site of Mission San Diego de Alcal√°. Presidio Hill remained the primary settlement for several decades because it was defensible against attack by European enemies or hostile Native Americans. As the need for defense decreased, settlers preferred to live at the base of the hill because of greater convenience. In the 1820s the town of San Diego grew up at the base of the bluff, at the site commemorated by Old Town San Diego State Historic Park. The Presidio was abandoned and fell into disrepair.Journal of San Diego History, October 1968 During the pueblo period following Mexican independence, the Old Town area was the commercial and governmental hub of the region, even though its population was never more than a few hundred. San Diego during this period is vividly described by Richard Henry Dana, Jr. in his classic book Two Years Before the Mast. In 1834 the Mexican government granted San Diego the status of a pueblo or chartered town; however, its pueblo status was revoked in 1838 due to declining population. One problem limiting the town's growth was its location far from navigable water. All imports and exports had to be brought ashore in Point Loma and carried several miles over the La Playa Trail to the town.La Playa Trail Association When California was admitted to the United States in 1850, San Diego (still largely limited to the Old Town area) was made the county seat of San Diego County, even though the town's population was only 650.San Diego population table, San Diego Historical Society The Old Town area remained the heart of the city of San Diego until the 1860s, when a newcomer to San Diego named Alonzo Horton began to promote development at the site of present-day Downtown San Diego. Residents and businesses quickly abandoned \\"Old Town\\" for Horton's \\"New Town\\" because of New Town's proximity to shipping. In 1871 government records were moved from Old Town to a new county courthouse in New Town, and Downtown permanently eclipsed Old Town as the focal point of San Diego.Engstrand, Iris Wilson, San Diego: California's Cornerstone, San Diego: Sunbelt Publications, 2005, p. 80. Old Town San Diego State Historic Park preserves and recreates Old Town as it existed during the Mexican and early American periods, from its settlement in 1821, through 1872 when it lost its dominant position to Downtown. The Old Town area is a popular tourist destination, known especially for its Mexican restaurants. The state park itself hosts several eating establishments, and other restaurants and gift shops are found in the surrounding neighborhood.  Attractions  The Cosmopolitan Hotel The First San Diego Courthouse, now the Courthouse Museum, (left) and Colorado House, location of the Wells Fargo History Museum (right) Five original adobe buildings are part of the complex, which includes shops, restaurants and museums. Other historic buildings include a schoolhouse, a blacksmith shop, San Diego's first newspaper office, a cigar and pipe store, houses and gardens, and a stable with a carriage collection. There are also stores, with local artisans demonstrating their craft. There is no charge to enter the state park or any of its museums. The museums include: *Casa de Estudillo, 1827 adobe house, a National Historic Landmark in its own right * Casa de Machado y Silvas, 1840s adobe *Casa de Machado y Stewart, a restored 19th century adobe * Blackhawk Smithy & Stable, which features blacksmith demonstrations * Colorado House, reconstructed 1850s hotel building that serves as the Wells Fargo History Museum, featuring a reconstructed 19th- century stage stop and telegraph office * First San Diego Courthouse, a reconstructed mid-19th century courthouse * Johnson House, a reconstructed mid-19th century office building later the house of George Alonzo Johnson. * Mason Street School, the first public school house in San Diegohttp://www.sandiegohistory.org/links/oldtown.htm#mason * Racine and Laramie (\\"La Casa de Rodriguez\\"), a reconstructed mid-19th century period tobacconist * San Diego Union Museum, a mid-19th century period newspaper office and print shop * Seeley Stables, a reconstructed mid-19th century stable and barns that feature horse-drawn buggies, wagons, carriages and western memorabilia * Cosmopolitan Hotel and Restaurant (\\"La Casa de Bandini\\"), an 1870 restored hotel, still working as hotel and restaurant. * Living history demonstrations and free tours are regularly scheduled. Historical interpretation is primarily carried out by park employees and volunteers, and the Mexican Commercial corner is host to several locally based small businesses and artists. =Commercial concessions= The commercial facilities in Old Town State Park, such as restaurants and gift shops, are managed by outside contractors. For more than 30 years the largest single contractor was Bazaar del Mundo (\\"Bazaar of the World\\"), run by San Diego businesswoman Diane Powers. In a controversial move, in 2005 the state park agency did not renew her contract but awarded it to Plaza del Pasado (\\"Plaza of the Past\\"), run by Delaware North Companies. The goal was to create a more authentic and historically accurate presentation and appreciation of life and commerce in San Diego from 1821 to 1872. However revenue plunged under the new management. In spring 2009, Delaware North withdrew from its contract with the state and management changed hands to the Old Town Family Hospitality Corporation, headed by local restaurateur Chuck Ross.SignOn San Diego, May 5, 2010 The commercial area is now called Fiesta de Reyes (\\"Festival of the Kings\\"). =Adjacent attractions= *Adjacent to the state park is Heritage County Park, run by San Diego County. It houses seven buildings from the 1880s and 1890s which have been moved there from elsewhere in the city. *Also nearby is the Mormon Battalion Monument and Visitor Center. The city-owned Presidio Park, site of the original Presidio of San Diego, is on the adjacent hill. *The San Diego Sheriff's Museum and Educational Center is located in Old Town. It includes police equipment, uniforms, patrol car, helicopter, motorcycle, a jail cell and courtroom. *The Whaley House museum is also nearby.

There are then two periods that may be considered: the period of the spaceship output, and the period of the gun itself, which is necessarily a multiple of the spaceship output's period. A gun whose period is larger than the period of the output is a pseudoperiod gun. Day & Night The first gun to be found in Conway's Game of Life was the Gosper glider gun In the Game of Life, for every p greater than or equal to 14, it is possible to construct a glider gun in which the gliders are emitted with period p. Since guns continually emit spaceships, the existence of guns in Life means that initial patterns with finite numbers of cells can eventually lead to configurations with limitless numbers of cells, something that John Conway himself originally conjectured to be impossible. However, according to Conway's later testimony, this conjecture was explicitly intended to encourage someone to disprove it ‚Äì i.e., Conway hoped that infinite-growth patterns did exist. Bill Gosper discovered the first glider gun in 1970, earning $50 from Conway. The discovery of the glider gun eventually led to the proof that Conway's Game of Life could function as a Turing machine. For many years this glider gun was the smallest one known in Life, although other rules had smaller guns.

It marks the final involvement of American producer Shel Talmy in the Kinks' 1960s studio recordings; henceforth Ray Davies would produce recordings. Many of the recordings feature the keyboard work of Nicky Hopkins and the backing vocals of Davies's wife, Rasa. Two hit singles are included: \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" and \\"Death of a Clown\\". The album was ranked No. 288 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It was voted number 237 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). Recording Ray Davies assumed control over production after the departure of Shel Talmy; hence Something Else marked a change in the sound and production style of the Kinks. Davies felt unsure of his skill in mixing and recording the group's records, and later commented: \\"I feel that I shouldn't have been allowed to produce Something Else. What went into an album required someone whose approach was a little bit more mundane\\".Something Else CD liner notes Apart from \\"End of the Season\\", the album was recorded between the autumn of 1966 and the summer of 1967, when the Kinks had cut back on touring and had begun recording and stockpiling songs for Davies's as-yet poorly defined \\"village green\\" project. The song \\"Village Green\\" was recorded in November 1966 during the sessions for the album, but was released on a French EP in 1967 and did not appear on a Kinks LP until the next release, The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society. Composition Musically, Something Else features multiple different genres and stylistic influences, from the chamber pop of \\"Death of a Clown\\"https://m.chicagoreader.com/chicago/kinks-guitarist-dave-davies- continues-to-stake-his-claim-as-a-rawk-god-at-age-72/Content?oid=69567449 to the bossa nova of \\"No Return\\". Departing from the hard-edged rock and roll of the group's earlier material, the album features mellower, acoustic baroque pop ballads, English music hall, and \\"tempered\\" R&B.; Rolling Stone described the album as a product of the band's \\"introspective soft rock period\\". Ray Davies's lyrics on the album deal with English-inspired subject matter, particularly the harpsichord-laden \\"Two Sisters\\", the lazy shuffle \\"End of the Season\\", and the sardonic \\"David Watts\\". The album includes three songs composed by Dave Davies, including the hit single \\"Death of a Clown\\". Reception The album sold poorly in the UK, in part because it competed with budget-priced compilation albums of early Kinks hits from 1964 to 1966; also, Pye Records had released \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", \\"Death of a Clown\\" and other songs before the album appeared. Something Else also sold poorly in the US upon release there in January 1968, where the group was still the subject of a US ban on live and television performances. James Pomeroy, in a March 1968 review in Rolling Stone, felt it was the best album the Kinks had made to that point, praising the \\"humor, cynicism, perception and irony\\" where he felt the band are at their best.

The population in 2011 was 76,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of .Eurostat It contains the localities Faj√£zinha and Ladeiras. History A view of Faj√£zinha from the central plateau and Ribeira Grande The western coast was explored during the middle of the 16th century, with the first stable settlements appearing in the beginning of the following century. These first colonists were captained by Jo√£o Soares, native of S√£o Miguel, who settled in the area of Lajedo. Faj√£zinha was de-annexed from Lajes das Flores in July 1676, by provision of the bishop of Angra, friar D. Louren√ßo de Castro. The parish of Nossa Senhora dos Rem√©dios das Faj√£s was established, with a jurisdiction that included the western coast from Ponta da Faj√£ until Mosteiro. It is the fourth oldest religious parish on the island. One of the first stories from Faj√£zinha was in 1789, by a judge, Jos√© Gon√ßalves da Silva, who referred to the construction of a stone bridge over the Ribeira Grande. It was a formidable construction for the era. It became historically referred to as a ponte da m√° mem√≥ria (the bridge of bad memories); as Father Ant√≥nio Cam√µes would relate: :[There was a flood in 1794] that did not just destroy the bridge, but not as much as a small vestige, no remains, it disappeared from the rivers course, disappearing into the sea, leaving a large sandy debris field to a distance of 300 bra√ßas [], with unmeasurable loss for the farmers who had lands along the river's banks, and whom to the sea lost all. Administratively, Faj√£zinha has always been an administrative division of Lajes das Flores. Between 1895 and 1898, it was de- annexed from Lajes and incorporated into the neighbouring municipality of Santa Cruz das Flores. Since 1616 it was the religious center of the parish of the Faj√£s, a Catholic organ whose principal patron was Nossa Senhora dos Rem√©dios, that included Ponta, Faj√£ Grande, Caldeira and Mosteiro. But by 1850, Mosteiro and Caldeira become their own parishes, and in 1861, Faj√£ Grande and Ponta Delgada das Flores, received the same privilege. =20th century= On 3 December 2010, around 5:00 am, following 72 consecutive hours of rain, a mudslide hit the town, causing severe destruction. During the event, homes were inundated, while cars and property were dragged away by a river of mud, water, vegetation and refuse from the village. At about 11:50 a.m., as the showers dissipated, the extent of the damage was made evident: the junta de freguesia (), main access to the hamlet, and electricity were cut off (although EDA, the local utility, was able to put the village on generators quickly). As some villagers congregated in the primary school and local church, some were immediately evacuated to the tourist village of Cuada to the south of parish. On 13 June 2012, the Secretaria Regional da Ci√™ncia, Tecnologia e Equipamentos (Regional Secretariat for Science, Technology and Equipment) awarded the contract for construction of two retaining walls, construction of ditches and new paving of the parish to Tecnovia A√ßores, S.A. in order to improve access to the region following the mudslides. Geography The valley of Fajazinha, bounded in the west by the Atlantic and surrounded by the cliffs on the remaining sides The parish is located on the west coast of the Flores, south of the Faj√£ Grande, and extends through an irregular plain that includes four crater-lakes: Lagoa Funda (Deep Lake, which is deep), Lagoa Comprida (Long Lake), Lagoa Branca (White Lake), and Lagoa Seca (Dry Lake). It is an area of many peat-bogs, and forests of endemic plants, including the cedro-do-mato (Azorean juniper), used by local artisans. Nearby is the waterfall, Cascata da Ribeira Grande. Faj√£zinha is intersected by the Ribeira Grande, a major river/rapids on the island, which, apart from its crystalline waters, is known for its innumerable floods. Father Jos√© Ant√≥nio Cam√µes, in his work Roteiro Exacto da Costa da Ilha, mentions the following: :Passing that population you will encounter Ribeira Grande, which divides this parish...its exaggerated force and impetuousness, which is truly great. The waters fall from a formidable height, extreme in the parish of Faj√£zinha, from a height of 200 bra√ßas [] it falls; it incorporates and aggregates all the waters of the headlands, which demarcate the parish, from the east to southwest, which is the river-valley of the blacksmiths, four grottoes, without name in the Rocha do Velho, the grotto do Enchente, whose waters increase in volume and become furious in the winter, and also when there is rain in the summer, its invariable. The region is a natural jewel, that Jo√£o Vieira wrote: :‚ÄúAlong the difficult, the hand of man, with much sweat, constructed a church and houses, opened a road where heavy trucks cross, means of communication with the rest of the island. It's an admirable example of the implantation in the land and harmony with nature. Seen from above, the houses, maybe because of jealousy, run to the seas, accompanying Ribeira Grande, which has for four centuries have filled the navigable waters that crossed between the Old and New World. Between cereal fields of corn that circle the white homes, a road of black asphalt serpentine between greenery. If a biblical paradise existed by the sea...we could think that this corner was part of it... The 2011 Lorca earthquake was responsible for creating a special wetland around the coast of Fajazinha.

The population in 2011 was 43,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of .Eurostat History Its toponymy has been debated by historians, although some theories suggest that it was named for the comparable civil parish on the island of S√£o Miguel. The first colonists, motivated to settle here by a man named Jo√£o Soares, were settlers from the region of Mosteiros, renaming this zone in its honour. In 1676, the locality of Mosteiro was de-annexed from the parish of Lajes das Flores and included in the ecclesiastical parish of the Faj√£s, with its seat in the parish of Nossa Senhora dos Rem√©dios da Fajanzinha. The adventurer Ant√≥nio de Freitas, former seminarian, had emigrated to China, where he made his fortune. Returning from his life in the Far East in 1846, he ordered the construction of the Parochial Church of Mosteiro, in the invocation of the Holy Trinity, in gratitude for God's intervention in saving his possessions during the trip. In 1850, Mosteiro was elevated to parish, along with Caldeira, on the completion of the parochial church. As related by Francisco Gomes, \\"at the time of the erection of the parish it was decently ornamented, and provided with vestments, and other objects necessary for the Divine Cult\\". During this period, the parish included 90 homes, including 300 inhabitants. As Father Jos√© Ant√≥nio Cam√µes, wrote after describing the bridge of Sargo, he also referred to the small port of Mosteiro \\"where tragically three or four boats capsized...the small port is part of a small community called \\"Os Mosteiros\\", and indicate the existence of two streams, the \\"Ribeira do Mosteiro\\" and \\"Ribeira dos Ladr√µes\\" (or Fund√£o) that ends the district of the parish of Nossa Senhora dos Rem√©dios and Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio of Lajes\\". The same historian referred to a population of 31 homes, including 83 men and 92 women, noting: \\"There are eight tiled houses, and not a man who wears shoes. There is a twenty-year judge with scribe, subject to the jurisdiction of the town of Lajes. The ordinance soldiers of the village are subordinate to the 2nd company in the villa of Lajes.\\" During the 18th century, with the lack of development and investments, many of the residents from the parish abandoned the parish for prosperous centres in Brazil. This was later supplanted by emigration to the United States. The parish continued to be part of the municipality of Santa Cruz das Flores, between 18 November 1895 and 13 January 1898, when Lajes was suppressed. Geography A view of the Rocha dos Bord√µes one of the emblematic geological features of the island The parish of Mosteiro is part of the municipality of Lajes das Flores, whose municipal seat is located . With an area of , it was one of the smallest parishes in Portugal, constituted by the settlements of Mosteiro and the locality of Caldeira. The parish and pure coastal waters is a natural sanctuary for endemic, maritime flora and fauna, many unexplored, offering excellent conditions for fishing, diving and nautical sports. Economy Agriculture, herding and a subsistence economy supports the economy of the parish. Cultivation of lands and raising of dairy/cattle are the essential parts of the islands' economy. Almost all the residents raise dairy cattle, on a susbsistence basis, in particular pastures and greenspace, resulting in the associated nickname Green Meat (). Considered a specialty market, the meat produce has become a regional mark for the island. Mosteiro is the centre of the regional public school for basic and 1st cycle instruction, but is inoperationive due to the lack of students. Helping to support its nascent tourist market, the parish maintains several historical buildings and structures; these include parochial church, the Imp√©rio de Divino Esp√≠rito Santo, the watermills and lookouts, such as the Chafariz da Caldeira, Cabe√ßo do Sinal, Cabe√ßo da Muda, Vista do Portal Poio and Cruz dos Bredos.

Teaching career Neil Gershenfeld as keynote speaker at APMM 2010. In 1998, Gershenfeld started a class at MIT called \\"How to make (almost) anything\\". Gershenfeld wanted to introduce expensive, industrial-size machines to the technical students. However, this class attracted a lot of students from various backgrounds: artists, architects, designers, students without any technical background. In his interview to CNN, Gershenfeld said that \\"the students... were answering a question I didn't ask, which is: What is this stuff good for? And the answer is: Not to make what you can buy in stores, but to make what you can't buy in stores. It's to personalise fabrication\\". Gershenfeld believes that this is the beginning of a new revolution: digital revolution in fabrication that will allow people to fabricate things, machines on demand. Gershenfeld has presented his course on \\"How to make (almost) anything\\" at the Association of Professional Model Makers (APMM) 2010 Conference. This class later has led Gershenfeld to create Fab lab in collaboration with Bakhtiar Mikhak at MIT. Gershenfeld feels very passionate about this project, as he believes that teaching kids how to use technology and create it themselves will empower the future generations to become more independent and create technology that each individual community needs, not a technology that is currently available on the market. Fab labs have spread around the world, having been established in the remotest of places and countries. In his interview with Discover magazine on the question what personal fabrication might be useful for, Gershenfeld said, \\"There is a surprising need for emergent technologies in many of the least developed places on the planet. While our needs might be fairly well met, there are billions of people on the planet whose needs are not. Their problems don't need incremental tweaks in current technology, but a revolution\\". As well as \\"How to make (almost) anything\\" class, Gershenfeld has started teaching the following classes: \\"How To Make Something That Makes (almost) Anything\\", \\"The Physics of Information Technology\\", \\"The Nature of Mathematical Modeling\\".

A boule of silicon is the starting material for most of the integrated circuits used today. In the semiconductor industry synthetic boules can be made by a number of methods, such as the Bridgman technique and the Czochralski process, which result in a cylindrical rod of material. In the Czochralski process a seed crystal is required to create a larger crystal, or ingot. This seed crystal is dipped into the pure molten silicon and slowly extracted. The molten silicon grows on the seed crystal in a crystalline fashion. As the seed is extracted the silicon solidifies and eventually a large, cylindrical boule is produced. A semiconductor crystal boule is normally cut into circular wafers using an inside hole diamond saw or diamond wire saw, and each wafer is lapped and polished to provide substrates suitable for the fabrication of semiconductor devices on its surface. The process is also used to create sapphires, which are used for substrates in the production of blue and white LEDs, optical windows in special applications and as the protective covers for watches.

Few historians would refer to the area of Fazenda, until Father Jos√© Ant√≥nio Cam√µes elaborated on the island's; from Ribeira Funda, he would recount: :\\"In about 55 arms-lengths, the river runs to the sea along a cliff called Fazenda...continuing to the south-southeast, In the same bay, is a lowland called Cherne. A short distance from this lowland is a small point called Ponta da Fazenda\\". Later, Father Cam√µes would note that the zone was occupied by 72 homes, 395 inhabitants in total (198 men to 197 women). He would go on to describe the local industry, noting how the men were \\"hearty, robust and jovial\\" and responsible for the production of best roof-tiles on the island. Albeit only administratively autonomous in 1919, it was religiously independent of Lajes das Flores in 1904. At that time, Senator Andr√© de Freitas had unsuccessfully attempted to promote the village to civil parish status. Similarly, and much later, Senator Machado Serpa had a similar idea; on December 9, 1919, organic law 915 was promulgated creating the civil parish of Fazenda. On 10 November 1959, Bishop D. Manuel Afonso de Carvalho established Fazenda as a parochial church congregation with all the rights under Canonical Law. During the 1940s, a small whaling industry was operated by Fazendense Francisco Nunes Azevedo. Geography Fazenda is administrative division of Lajes das Flores, and located to the north and northeast of the municipal seat. It extends from the eastern coast where it slopes along a north-northwest to south-southeast orientation to the center of the island. The settlements in this parish area oriented along the Regional Road connecting them to the parishes of Lomba (to the north) and Lajes das Flores (to the south). The parish contains the localities Calv√°rio, Barreira Vermelha, Eiras and Feital.  Economy  Fazenda has been characterized for its fertile soils, and the local population is primarily involved In agriculture and animal husbandry associated with the dairy industry. The parish's experience with cooperativism started on 4 April 1919, with the establishment of the Fructu√°ria de Produ√ß√£o de Lactic√≠nios da Freguesia do Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres da Fazenda, later renamed the Cooperativa Agr√≠cola Fructu√°ria de Produ√ß√£o de Lactic√≠nios Senhor Santo Cristo by its founder, Father Jos√© Furtado Mota. In 1950, the co-operative's constitution was amended (29 November) and elaborated, becoming known As the Cooperativa Agr√≠cola de Lactic√≠nios do Senhor Santo Cristo, SCARL, under new directors Fernando Pereira Gomes, Francisco de Freitas Silva and Fernando Gomes Trigueiro. In 1968, the cooperative adapted new technologies and processes to produce a variant on the S√£o Jorge cheese, while reducing the production of its local butter (At its only factory In Ribeirinha). At the time it was considered pioneering, and later duplicated by other dairy producers on the island.

Initial adoption Despite the claim to be 'Anglo-American', the first edition of AACR was published in 1967 in somewhat distinct North American and British texts. The second edition of 1978 unified the two sets of rules (adopting the British spelling 'cataloguing') and brought them in line with the International Standard Bibliographic Description. Libraries wishing to migrate from the previous North American text were obliged to implement 'desuperimposition', a substantial change in the form of headings for corporate bodies. Successor While the 2002 updates included substantial improvements to AACR's treatment of non-book materials, the proliferation of 21st century formats in a networked environment and the rise of electronic publishing signaled the necessity for significant change in the cataloging code. Plans for a third edition (AACR3) were abandoned in 2005.Joint Steering Committee for Development of RDA: Historic Documents The international cataloging community turned its attention to drafting a completely new standard to succeed AACR. Informed by the work of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, the new framework was crafted to be more flexible and suitable for use in a digital environment: Resource Description and Access (RDA) was released in June 2010. The Library of Congress, National Library of Medicine, National Agricultural Library, and several national libraries of other English-speaking countries performed a formal test of RDA, resulting in a June 2011 report of findings.Testing Resource Description and Access (RDA): Archives See also * MARC standards  References  External links *AACR2 *JSC (Joint Steering Committee for Development of RDA) *A Brief History of AACR *RDA: Resource Description and Access Prospectus *ALCTS Newsletter article on RDA *Cataloger's Desktop Category:Archival science Category:Metadata Category:Metadata standards ","title":"Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules"},{"id":"1159061","text":"A pie chart showing global military expenditures by country for 2018, in US$ billions, according to SIPRI.

Financing militaries Military budgets often reflect how strongly a country perceives the likelihood of threats against it, or the amount of aggression it wishes to conjure. It also gives an idea of how much financing should be provided for the upcoming fiscal year. The size of a budget also reflects the country's ability to fund military activities.Statistics on Defense Expenditures in the U.S. per Capita, 1990-2011, NATO, April 2012. Factors include the size of that country's economy, other financial demands on that entity, and the willingness of that entity's government or people to fund such military activity. Generally excluded from military expenditures is spending on internal law enforcement and disabled veteran rehabilitation. The effects of military expenditure on a nation's economy and society, and what determines military expenditure, are notable issues in political science and economics. There are controversial findings and theories regarding these topics. Generally, some suggest military expenditure is a boost to local economies. Still, others maintain military expenditure is a drag on development. Among the countries maintaining some of the world's largest military budgets, China, India, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States are frequently recognized to be great powers. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, in 2018, total world military expenditure amounted to 1822 billion US$.Trends in World Military Expenditure Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In 2018, the United States spent 3.2% of its GDP on its military, while China 1.9%, Russia 3.9%, France 2.3%, United Kingdom 1.8%, India 2.4%, Israel 4.3%, South Korea 2.6% and Germany spent 1.2% of its GDP on defense.

Robin Crossby (May 18, 1954 ‚Äì July 23, 2008) was the creator of the H√¢rn fantasy setting and the H√¢rnMaster role-playing game system, as well as dozens of other related works describing the world of H√¢rn. Early life N. Robin Crossby was born of Anglo-Welsh parents in 1954 in London, England, the third of four children. His early hobbies included slot car racing, a fascination with dinosaurs and the drawing of fictional maps. His early education took place at William Ellis Grammar School in London. The roots of H√¢rn can probably be traced back to his early role-playing experiments with his brother and sister in the early 1960s, which involved a hand-drawn map and a personal history of the lost continent of Atlantis. Crossby's family emigrated to Canada in 1968, settling in the Vancouver, British Columbia suburb of Coquitlam. He attended Centennial High School. Between 1974 and 1980 Crossby was involved in dozens of projects, only some of which came to fruition. After graduating high school both he and his future wife Sharon went to work assembling circuit boards at Crossby Electronics. This company was owned by his father, Victor Crossby. They did a great deal of GlenAyre Electronics‚Äô contract work during the 1970s and were responsible for the bulk of circuitry installed at the former BC Hydro tower located on Burnaby Mountain. Crossby was employed there until about 1980. He attended Douglas College from 1974 to 1976, graduating with an associate degree in Philosophy.Interview with Sharon MacLeod, 2009 =College years= During his tenure at Douglas College he began dabbling in graphic design, creating many logos and posters for various Douglas College clubs under the name Hexagon Graphics. Hexagon was still around decades later, its largest project being a logo design for Maple Ridge- based company Maple Meadows Glass in approximately 1995. After graduating Douglas College he transferred to Simon Fraser University, where he co-founded SPLUD, the Society for the Protection of Large Unpleasant Dragons. SPLUD was a board games club which held meetings in the SFU Rotunda. Some of the games played there were designed earlier by Crossby with names like Power and Resource. After encountering Dungeons and Dragons, he started on early precursors of H√¢rn. Hobbies Crossby was similarly attracted to the arts; he was an accomplished guitar player and composer who often performed at family gatherings. He was also an amateur playwright, and between Douglas College and SFU Robin, his future wife Sharon, his sister Sue and their friends operated a small community theatre company called Threshold Theatre out of the James Cowan Theatre in Burnaby. Family life Not long after arriving in Canada he met his future spouse, Sharon MacLeod, a close friend of his sister Susan. Robin and Sharon had their first child in 1983 (a daughter named Arien) and their second in 1987 (Faya). They were not married until 1987 just barely before the birth of their third daughter, Kiley, in 1988. Business and Publishing Beginning in 1977, Crossby started to codify his fantasy world of Kethira. Near the end of the 1970s Robin started calling his gaming system H√¢rn and began shopping it with publishers. In 1980, Robin made first contact with the gaming company that would later become Columbia Games Inc. Robin signed his first contract with the Vancouver-based gaming company in 1983. Throughout that year CGI published a series of booklets called Encyclopedia H√¢rnica, consisting of the history and background of several regions of the island of H√¢rn. These were followed in the next three years by the Kingdom Modules, a re-release of much of the same material in a more condensed format. Also in the early 80s, Columbia Games released the H√¢rn Regional Module, which included a massive, full-colour map that attracted many reluctant players to the system. The H√¢rn Regional Module was later re- released as H√¢rnWorld. About Harn Like many popular role-playing environments of the time, H√¢rn took place in a quasi-medieval setting, on the world of K√®th√Æra in what could be described in another reality, but described in detail many factors that other systems often neglected. One section of H√¢rnWorld, for instance, laid out a complex model for generating weather patterns that affected the entire planet. H√¢rn was unusual at its outset for having no defined system to support the story ‚Äì many early players used Dungeons & Dragons rules systems or RuneQuest models to actually play H√¢rn campaigns. It wasn't until 1986 that Columbia Games released H√¢rn's companion rule system, H√¢rnMaster I, which was a leap forward in RPG design in that it calculated the probabilities of various battle, exploration and magic scenarios in a far greater degree of detail than any existing system of the time. The level of detail involved in both modules and statistics made it intimidating for more faint-hearted players. H√¢rn meta-material was available in the form of CGI's H√¢rnQuest Magazine, released four times annually, which is still published today. At one time H√¢rn fandom also had a thriving mailing list called H√¢rnLine, also known as the Duffleboard for its moderator Rob Duff. In 1996 CGI came out with H√¢rnMaster Core (known colloquially as H√¢rnMaster II), printed in full-colour on cardstock in a binder that theoretically allowed the system to expand with future modules. The modules included in the new H√¢rnMaster Core series were also printed with the more popular D20 statistics, a different points system that simplified H√¢rn's extremely detailed points system and brought out resentment in veteran H√¢rn players who preferred the H√¢rnMaster I rules. CGI argued that this would bring in a new generation of players, but H√¢rn fandom has boasted about the same number of players since approximately 1990. H√¢rnMaster II also retailed for nearly US$50, which for the time was extremely expensive. Columbia Games moved to Washington state, and in 1994 Crossby stopped producing new material for Columbia; fans increasingly began to add their own expansions (called \\"fanon\\") to fill the void left by the lack of official support for the setting, and he began working on his own version of H√¢rn. =International Publishing and Conflict with Columbia Games= In 1998, Robin and CGI were contacted by Auran Games, an Australian video game company interested in developing a H√¢rnic Internet role-playing game. Robin signed his second contract with CGI that same year. Over the next three years Auran paid for four trips to Australia including one where he was accompanied by his wife, as well as a business associate Tom Dalgliesh and his wife Penny. But tensions had been rising between Robin and Columbia Games, which had moved to Washington state for tax purposes in 1999. Robin had grown unhappy with the direction being taken with the H√¢rn product line and had begun self-publishing his own modules under the name Kelestia Productions in 1997. These modules and rulebooks diverged from CGI's releases as of the H√¢rnMaster I series. Robin released both digital products in PDF format through Hyperbooks.com and print products which were produced in Burnaby and shipped in large volume from his home with the help of his eldest daughter Arien. During this period he published nearly half a dozen products, including his own extension of the basic rules called H√¢rnMaster Gold. HMG was not only a new version of the H√¢rn universe, but a guide to campaigning with the H√¢rn world in any gaming system without compromising on the level of detail. CGI and Robin worked together alongside Auran until 2000 when the Auran project was cancelled by Electronics Arts, the games proposed publisher, before it was fully completed. It was one of a number of games cancelled by Electronic Arts at the time due to budget cutbacks. Over the next three years there arose more conflicts between Robin and CGI over licensing and unpaid royalties, which led to Robin formally dissolving his contract with Columbia Games in 2003. Columbia games continued to produce H√¢rn products in defiance of the contract dissolution up until Crossby's death and beyond. The present-day Kelestia Productions website was founded in approximately 2006 and began selling digital copies of modules under the name H√¢rn Canon, to differentiate it from the products still being sold by Columbia Games. These modules were created not only by Robin but by his fans; by this period Robin was actively encouraging the input of his fanbase to create new material. The Ch√©lemby City (publication title: Ch√©lemby: City of the Sea Kings) module was produced as a group effort between Robin and many contributors and fans, including his long-time friend Rob Duff. Kelestia Productions was incorporated in October 2008, and since his death in July 2008, the company has published modules and products under the guidance of his heirs and estate-appointed project heads Jeremy Baker (a New Zealander) and Ken Snellings (an American). Though the dispute between Kelestia Productions and Columbia Games has never been completely resolved, Kelestia Productions has done business selling electronic-format modules since about 2006. After Robin's death in 2008 his intellectual property rights passed on to his eldest daughter Arien. The trademark for the name ‚ÄúH√¢rn‚Äù was formally granted to Arien Crossby by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office in September 2009, and Kelestia Productions is not currently pursuing the American trademark, but continues to produce module content and other products independently.Interview with Arien Crossby, January 2016 Later life and death In early 2006, Robin was diagnosed with liposarcoma of the bowel, a cancer arising in fat cells. Throughout his illness he continued his work, and the last map completed by Crossby was a map of the entire Harnic world. Many also applauded Crossby for keeping a sharp and witty blog on the Kelestia website during the course of his illness.Robin's Blog Despite surgery and chemotherapy, he died two years later on July 23, 2008, in a hospice in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia.Interview with Arien Crossby, May 2010 References External links *Crossby's personal webpage *Homepage of Kelestia Productions Category:1954 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People from Coquitlam Category:Canadian game designers Category:Deaths from cancer in British Columbia Category:Deaths from liposarcoma Category:Role-playing game designers ","title":"N.

It is located underneath Stamford Road, at the junctions with North Bridge Road and St Andrew‚Äôs Road. The station is situated near City Hall (after which the station is named after), Raffles City, the Padang, St Andrew's Cathedral and The Cenotaph. The station is one of the earliest stations to be opened on the network, opening on 12 December 1987 when the North South line extended from Toa Payoh to Outram Park station. Cross-platform transfers between the NSL and EWL began on 4 November 1989 when the MRT network split operationally after the completion of the eastern line extension to Tanah Merah station. Due to its location at the heart of the Civic District and the numerous landmarks within its vicinity, City Hall station is one of the busiest MRT stations in Singapore. History Faregates at the station. The station was initially named St Andrew's before the construction of the station. It was later renamed to City Hall for historical reasons in 1982. Contract 107B for the construction of City Hall station was awarded to Nishimatsu-Lum Chang Joint Venture at a contract sum of S$77.7 million (US$ million) in May 1984. A launching ceremony for the construction of the station was held on 7 September 1984. Largely a Christian ceremony, the gathering prayed for the safety of the construction workers, the successful completion of the station, the safety of the Cathedral and blessings for those using the station. The construction of the tunnels between the City Hall and Raffles Place stations was difficult as it has to go underneath the Singapore River, which was still polluted at the time and made the soil acidic. An integral waterproofing system was then implemented for the tunnel, as the system is not to be affected by the acidic soil condition and should be an effective and fast system to avoid delay due to tidal condition. Parts of the Singapore River had to be \\"drained\\" in stages to facilitate the construction of the MRT tunnels. A cofferdam made of sheet-piles was used to drain the river to allow the construction using the cut-and-cover method in stages. The construction was done in two stages: from the riverbank at the Immigration Department site and the remaining at the other side. The station opened on 12 December 1987, and later became an interchange station between the East West and North South lines after the operational split on 4 November 1989. Plans were announced by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to construct a new underpass between the station and the redeveloped Capitol Singapore. Construction work on the underground link and the new station entrance started in the fourth quarter of 2014, and completed in the first quarter of 2015. =Incidents= During the construction, on 26 May 1985, there was a landslide at the site due to the collapse of the wall supporting the excavation. Those in the nearby St Andrew's Cathedral were evacuated as a safety precaution, as the Cathedral may risk collapse. The Cathedral was eventually declared safe for use and operations resumed on 2 June, while advising churchgoers not the use the half of the Cathedral close to the site. On 10 December, a Japanese foreman miner died at the construction site of the station, having fallen to his death. The man is the fourth fatality in the construction of the MRT network. Investigations revealed that it was entirely an accident, with all safety measures observed. On 5 June 2008, 280 youths spent the night at City Hall to learn how to deal with an emergency in a train tunnel. There was a simulated bomb explosion during this exercise and they learn how to activate the detrainment ramps at both ends of the train, and evacuate to safety via an escape shaft. The students also used the items from their Ready Bags to \\"survive\\" the attack. This station was part of the series of 2011 MRT train disruptions on 15 and 17 December 2011, caused by a misalignment between the trains' current collector shoes, which collect power from the third rail, and the third rail itself. These were Singapore's two largest MRT disruptions at the time of occurrence. A power failure and blackout occurred at the station on 6 July 2012 at about 1.30 pm, causing the platforms for north and west- bound trains to turn pitch black. Air-conditioning and escalators also stopped functioning. Emergency lighting was turned on immediately after the incident occurred. However, train services were not affected by the incident. Lighting was progressively restored from 2 pm, and was back to normal by 3.15 pm. Station details =Services= The station has three levels with two levels of island platforms. City Hall is one of the two paired cross-platform interchanges between the East West and North South lines. On the EWL, the station is after Bugis, while on the NSL it is after Dhoby Ghaut station. Both lines continue and interchange at Raffles Place station. The station code is EW13 NS25, as reflected on official maps. Before the eastern extension to Tanah Merah station and the Marina Bay southern extension on 4 November 1989, there were through services from the Yishun to Lakeside stations. A few days before the opening, on 28 October, transfer drills were launched for commuters to familiarise with transferring between the two services: with passengers from Yishun having to alight at either Raffles Place or City Hall to continue their journey to Lakeside or vice versa. MRTC (Mass Rapid Transit Corporation) staff were stationed at the platforms to help commuters, in addition to MRTC and SMRT's advertisement campaigns about the transfers. =Public art= A mural Vitreous Enamelled Mural by Simon Wong is displayed at this station as part of the MRTC's commission of S$2 million (US$ million) of artworks at six MRT stations along the NSL. The mural reflects the station's themes of governance, justice and administration. =In popular culture= City Hall is one of the four MRT stations to appear in the original and the \\"Uniquely Singapore Edition\\" of the board game Monopoly.

Early life  Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Malvina Braun Dubich (born in Trieste, with German, Slavic and Venetian ancestry) and Herminio Fini (with ancestry from Benevento, Italy). Herminio was a handsome and very wealthy man, but also tyrannical, with extreme religious views. He made his young wife very unhappy and, within eighteen month's of Leonor's birth, she fled back to Trieste with the child. Leonor was raised there and she would be expelled from various schools for being rebellious. As a Catholic, Herminio refused to give Malvina a divorce, which was only granted to her in 1919 through an Italian court. Custody battles often involved Fini and her mother in sudden flights and disguises. In her early teens, an eye disease forced her to wear bandages on both eyes. After recovering, she decided to become an artist. She moved to Milan at the age of 17, and then to Paris, in either 1931 or 1932. There, she became acquainted with Carlo Carr√† and Giorgio de Chirico, who influenced much of her work. She also came to know Paul √âluard, Max Ernst, Georges Bataille, Henri Cartier- Bresson, Picasso, Andr√© Pieyre de Mandiargues, and Salvador Dal√≠. She traveled Europe by car with Mandiargues and Cartier-Bresson where Cartier-Bresson took a photograph, one of his best known, of her naked in a pool with her then partner, de Mandiargues. The photograph of Fini sold in 2007 for $305,000 - the highest price paid at auction for one of Cartier-Bresson's works to that date.  Career  Fini had no formal artistic training, yet she was familiar with the traditional Renaissance and Mannerist styles encountered during her upbringing in Italy. When she was 17, she had a painting exhibited in a gallery in Trieste and received a commission to paint portraits from dignitaries in Milan, where she had her first one-woman show at the Galerie Barbaroux in 1929. Her first major exhibition was in 1936 in New York at Julian Levy Gallery. Fini was part of a pre-war generation of Parisian artists, and very important in the Surrealist movement though she is sometimes overlooked in favour of her male contemporaries. In 1943, Fini was included in Peggy Guggenheim's show Exhibition by 31 Women at the Art of This Century gallery in New York. In 1949 Frederick Ashton choreographed a ballet conceptualized by Fini, \\"Le R√™ve de Leonor\\" (\\"Leonor's Dream\\") with music by Benjamin Britten. In London, she exhibited at the Kaplan gallery in 1960 and at the Hanover Gallery in 1967. In the summer of 1986 there was a retrospective at the Mus√©e du Luxembourg in Paris that drew in more than 5,000 people a day. It featured over 260 works in a variety of media. A tribute to the many artistic and creative avenues that her career took throughout her lifetime, the exhibition included watercolours and drawings, theatre/costume designs, paintings and masks. Many of Fini's paintings featured women in positions of power or in very sexualised contexts. An example of this is the painting La Bout du Monde where a female figure is submerged in water up to her breasts with human and animal skulls surrounding her. Madonna used the imagery in her video, \\"Bedtime Story\\" in 1994. In the spring of 1987, Fini had an exhibition at London's Editions Graphique's gallery. Her work didn't always fit the typical popular conception of surrealism, sometimes exploring the 'femme fatale' without any particularly ambiguous or monstrous imagery. Nonetheless it often included symbols like sphinxes, werewolves, and witches. Most of the characters in her art were female or androgynous. \\"The terrifying female monster and the adoring girl-child are socially constructed stereotypes continued by the male surrealists. In order to promote the liberated, autonomous woman, Fini purposefully destabilized these stereotypes by combining each construct in a single figure, so that sphinxes can be protective and creative while girls can be sensual and aggressive.\\" Fini was also featured in an exhibition entitled \\"Women, Surrealism, and Self- representation\\" at the San Francisco Modern Museum of Art in 1999. She painted portraits of Jean Genet, Anna Magnani, Jacques Audiberti, Alida Valli, Jean Schlumberger (jewelry designer) and Suzanne Flon as well as many other celebrities and wealthy visitors to Paris. While working for Elsa Schiaparelli she designed the bottle for the perfume \\"Shocking\\", which became the top selling perfume for the House of Schiaparelli and was the acknowledged inspiration for Jean-Paul Gaultier's later torso-shaped bottles.Elsa Schiaparelli#Perfumes In 1959, Fini made a fairy tale-inspired painting called Les Sorci√®res for the Mexican actress, Mar√≠a F√©lix. She designed costumes and decorations for theatre, ballet and opera, including famously the first ballet performed by Roland Petit's Ballet de Paris, \\"Les Demoiselles de la nuit\\", featuring a young Margot Fonteyn. She also designed the costumes for two films, Renato Castellani's Romeo and Juliet (1954) and John Huston's A Walk with Love and Death (1968). In the 1970s, she wrote three novels, Rogomelec, Moumour, Contes pour enfants velu and Oneiropompe. Her friends included Jean Cocteau, Giorgio de Chirico, and Alberto Moravia, Fabrizio Clerici and most of the other artists and writers inhabiting or visiting Paris. She illustrated many works by the great authors and poets, including Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Baudelaire and Shakespeare, as well as texts by new writers. Leonor Fini provided illustrations to books by Lise Deharme, the first being Le Poids d‚Äôun oiseau in 1955 and Oh! Violette ou la Politesse des V√©g√©taux in 1969. She was very generous with her illustrations and donated many drawings to writers to help them get published. She is, perhaps, best known for her graphic illustrations for the sexually explicit Histoire d'O. In 2009, Italy dedicated a large exhibition to Fini's work and circle in Trieste. A section of the exhibition was dedicated to her artist friends such as Fabrizio Clerici, Stanislao Lepri, Pavel Tchelitchew, Jan Lebenstein, Mich√®le Henricot, Dorothea Tanning; a painting by Eros Renzetti, a friend of recent years, concludes this section of the Leonor Fini l'italienne de Paris.  Personal life  Fini was primarily an heterosexual woman. Throughout her life she lived and had several affairs with men. However, her insistence on sexual freedom included experiencing the love of another woman, but this was sometimes misinterpreted as being a lesbian. She told Whitney Chadwick in 1982: \\"I am a woman, therefore I have had the 'feminine experience', but I am not a lesbian\\". She also said: \\"Marriage never appealed to me, I've never lived with one person. Since I was 18, I've always preferred to live in a sort of community - a big house with my atelier and cats and friends, one with a man who was rather a lover and another who was rather a friend. And it has always worked.\\" Married once, for a brief period, to Federico Veneziani, they were divorced after she met the Italian Count, Stanislao Lepri, who abandoned his diplomatic career shortly after meeting Fini and lived with her thereafter. She met the Polish writer Konstanty Jele≈Ñski, known as Kot in Rome in January 1952. She was delighted to discover that he was the illegitimate half-brother of , who had been one of her favorite lovers. Kot joined Fini and Lepri in their Paris apartment in October 1952 and the three remained inseparable until their deaths. She later employed an assistant to join the household, which he described as \\"a little bit of prison and a lot of theatre\\". One of his jobs was to look after her beloved Persian cats. Over the years she acquired as many as 23 of them; they shared her bed and were allowed to roam the dining- table at mealtimes. The 'inner circle' expanded to include the American artist, and the Argentinian poet Juan-Bautista Pinero.  Legacy  A biographical song about Leonor Fini's life, \\"Leonor\\", is featured on Welsh artist Katell Keineg's 1997 second album, Jet. The \\"Catalogue Raisonn√© of The Oil Paintings of Leonor Fini,\\" by Richard Overstreet and Neil Zukerman is scheduled for publication in the fall of 2019.

It is located directly underneath Raffles Place, Singapore's financial district, south of the Singapore River. Due to its location, it is one of the busiest MRT stations on the wider MRT network. It is within close proximity to several points of attraction such as the Raffles Place Park, Merlion Park, the Downtown Core and the Fullerton Hotel. History On 9 October 1983, local ventures had won the MRT job for the construction of the tunnel from City Hall to Raffles Place.Local ventures had won MRT job for construction On the larger scale, on 4 May 1984, the contractor, Taisei-Shimizu-Marubeni had awarded the contract for the station, Contract 108. To make way for the construction of the station, the Chartered Bank Building was torn down. During the construction, massive rocks were blasted out of the way for the station, which shook several buildings near the station. This station used to be the largest and deepest MRT station in Singapore, but the record has since been broken multiple times, first by Dhoby Ghaut in 2003, then by Bras Basah in 2010, by Promenade in 2013 and then by Bencoolen in 2017, which is currently holding the record at 43 metres below ground. In 1998, some foreigners who could not find accommodation in Singapore were caught staying overnight in the station, and were regarded as loiterers. It is also one of the four MRT stations to appear in \\"Uniquely Singapore Edition\\" of the board game Monopoly. Land reclamation in the Marina Bay area has added more exits to additional buildings since 2000, which is Exit J towards the Marina Bay Link Mall. The station is the only MRT station to ever participate in three terrorist exercises, which are Exercise Northstar IV on 11 January 2004, Exercise Northstar V on 8 January 2006 when it was one of four stations which participated in the exercise on that day, as well as Exercise Northstar VII in 7 July 2009, together with Sentosa, VivoCity, Bedok, Tampines, Choa Chu Kang and Jurong East. The faregates at this station were replaced in 2014. The oldest station entrances A and B were heavily renovated by 28 September 2017 with glass cladding. On 7 October 2017, a small fire was spotted along the trackside in the tunnel between Marina Bay and this station, but it died out by itself. Its cause is unknown, but it may have been due to a short circuit. Due to the ongoing renovation works at Oxley @ Raffles, which is formerly Chevron House, barrier-free accessibility is restricted to Exit D instead. Station details Raffles Place station is one of the five MRT interchange stations in Singapore to feature a cross-platform interchange; the other stations are City Hall MRT station, Tanah Merah MRT station, Jurong East MRT station, Bayfront MRT station. The station has two island platforms, one for each level, with four tracks. On each level, one platform serves the North South line and the other platform serves the East West line. It is within walking distances to Downtown MRT station and Telok Ayer MRT station on the Downtown Line.

It is located at the heart of the Jurong Lake District, within the vicinity of JCube, Jem, Westgate, IMM, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Jurong East Bus Interchange. The station opened on 5 November 1988 as part of the MRT system extension to Jurong. The station was initially the terminus of the Branch line and now the NSL when the Branch line merged with the NSL. An additional track and platforms was added when the station went through upgrades in 2010 as part of the Jurong East Modification Project (JEMP). In 2027, Jurong East station will be an interchange with the Jurong Region Line (JRL). Jurong East station is also one of the busiest MRT stations in western Singapore. History Aerial perspective of Jurong East Interchange and the station Exit A of Jurong East station The Ong Chwee Kou Building Contarctors (OCK)-Sumitomo Construction partnership was pre-qualified for contracts 403 and 404 (which involves the construction of Ulu Pandan Depot to the station and from the station to Lakeside station respectively in May 1985. Originally Jurong Town and later Jurong, it was later renamed Jurong East on 27 March 1987. The station opened ahead of schedule on 5 November 1988, as part of the first stage of Phase 2 of the system. The station became the terminus for train services to Choa Chu Kang station when the Branch line opened on 10 March 1990 and later the NSL when the line extended through Woodlands station and merged with the Branch line. =Jurong East Modification Project= Exterior shot of Jurong East station taken after the JEMP. The Jurong East Modification Project (JEMP) was a key infrastructural upgrading project involving the construction of two new platforms and a new track at Jurong East, allowing two trains along the North South Line to enter and depart the station concurrently. Previously, trains had to take turns to arrive and depart from the station using a shared middle track. The new platforms and track allowed for improved NSL frequency between Yishun and Jurong East during weekday peak hours and reducing the crowding in trains. The Contract 1590 for the design, construction and completion of the new above-ground platform station extension adjacent to the existing station and associated viaducts was awarded to Sato Kagyo Pte Ltd at a contract sum of S$127 million. The station was retrofitted with half-height platform screen doors in 2009 which commenced operations on 18 December 2009. Originally projected to be opened in 2012, then Minister for Transport, Mr Raymond Lim, announced on 12 February 2009 that the date was pushed forward by a year, to 2011. Construction started in 2009 and was completed and handed to the operator at around the first quarter of 2011, with the new platforms and track being tested since then, before the announcement on 16 May 2011 about its operation date on 27 May 2011. To connect the new train tracks to the existing tracks, train services between Joo Koon and Clementi were halted on 4 & 5 September 2010 (affected substation is Chinese Garden, Ulu Pandan and possibly Dover), followed by train services between Jurong East and Bukit Gombak on 18 & 19 September 2010 (affected substation is Bukit Gombak). During the initial operation period, the new platforms and track were only operated on weekdays except public holidays, during the morning peak hour period, from 7:00 am to 9:00 am, as there were only five new C151A trains ready for revenue service. Evening peak hour operation from 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm on weekdays started from 27 December 2011 while the morning peak hour period was extended to end an hour later at 10:00 am after the next batch of trains became ready for revenue service. It was then extended progressively before the COVID-19 pandemic, between 6:00am and 11:00am, and after 5:00pm till 9:00pm. To make full use of the new platform, terminating NSL trains heading to Ulu Pandan Depot also use Platform A so that it will minimize disruption of mainline operations. The station has the most high-volume low-speed fans installed due to station's size, out of the 36 elevated stations. The fans commenced operations on 30 June 2012 together with Ang Mo Kio. Noise barriers (from PIE to Block 266 Toh Guan Road) and privacy screens (from Block 266 Toh Guan Road to Boon Lay Way and Block 108 Jurong East Street 13 to Jurong Town Hall Road) were also installed to reduce the amount of noise generated towards residential areas, between January 2011 and September 2014. =Jurong Region Line Interchange= On 9 May 2018, LTA announced that Jurong East station would be part of the proposed Jurong Region line (JRL). The station will be constructed as part of Phase 2, JRL (East), consisting of 7 stations between Tengah and Pandan Reservoir, and is expected to be completed in 2027. Contract J110 was awarded to Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd at a sum of S$197.4 million for the design and construction of Jurong East JRL station and associated viaducts, including Addition & Alteration works to the existing station complex. Construction will start in 2020, with completion in 2027. Station Details The station was designed by Scott Danielson, and it has a roof which utilises a geometric design similar to the original Jurong East Bus Interchange, in order to fit with the adjacent structure. The station currently has four tracks and three island platforms serving both the North South and East West lines. It is the terminus for the North South line. To the southeast, the tracks merges into two tracks, while to the northwest the tracks widen into six tracks, four of which are for the North South line. The four tracks later merges into two. As part of the JEMP, a new platform has been built to allow two trains along the North South Line to enter and depart the station at the same time. Previously, trains had to take turns to arrive and depart from the station using a shared middle track, which has been overcrowded during peak hours. Currently, the new platforms A and B are only opened on weekdays (except public holidays) during morning and evening peak hours. Incidents * On 4 February 2005, a 29-year-old man, Mak Hoy Meng went up to an SMRT employee at this station and gave him two handwritten notes that declared there was a bomb at one of the stations.The Straits Times, \\"Man Jailed For Bomb Hoax\\", 11 March 2005 The restaurant supervisor told Yeow Meng Chai that he saw a man drop the notes and even described the fellow in detail, down to the brand of the bag he was carrying. But under questioning by the police, he admitted he had written them himself and there were no bombs. His story came apart when his description differed in later versions. By then, police officers had searched extensively for the man. However, trains were not stopped. On 10 March 2005, he pleaded guilty under the United Nations (Anti- Terrorism Measures) Regulations to trying to hoax Yeow about a bomb on 4 February 2005 at 8 pm and was jailed for 2years. He admitted that at the time he tried to fool Yeow, he was disgruntled with the police and society in general, because he had been charged with theft and was out on bail. The theft charge ‚Äì stealing $50 from a restaurant was considered during sentencing. * A 62-year-old woman was found injured at the station at about 2:35 pm on 24 November 2011. The woman was taken to the National University Hospital where she subsequently died from her injuries. Police subsequently arrested a 55-year-old man for the alleged murder the following day. * In the evening of 14 October 2020, Jurong East station is one of the stations affected by the power fault on the North South and East West lines (NSEWL).

Underpass link between the East West and North East line. NEL platforms. Construction site of the TEL at Outram Park. During the construction of the station, the former Outram Prison and Outram Primary School were acquired for the construction of the station, and construction began in 1984. The contract for the construction of the tunnels between the Tiong Bahru and Maxwell (now Tanjong Pagar) stations was awarded to a Japanese joint venture Ohbayashi-Gumi/Okumura Corporation on November 1983 at a sum of S$73.85 million. During the construction, a slip road from Outram Road to Eu Tong Seng Street had to be closed and sewer pipes had to be moved. The tunnel from Outram Park to Tiong Bahru was completed in September 1984. In the initial stages of planning for the North East line in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, this was initially planned to be the southern terminus of the line. But in 1993, the LTA decided to extend the NEL to HarbourFront station (then called World Trade Centre Station), after noting that many people liked to go to the World Trade Centre (the present day HarbourFront Centre), but it was redeveloped from 2000 to 2003, and Sentosa Island. The East West line station upgrading was completed on 12 October 2002. Construction began in September 2000 for their lift access in the station for the disabled. The lift originally goes from level 1 to basement 2, skipping basement 1. It was extended to basement 3 when the North East line opened on 20 June 2003. =Thomson-East Coast Line Interchange= On 15 August 2014, LTA announced that Outram Park station would be part of the proposed Thomson East- Coast line (TEL). The station will be constructed as part of Phase 3, consisting of 13 stations between Mount Pleasant and Gardens by the Bay, and is expected to be completed in 2021. The Contract T220 for the design and construction of Outram Park TEL Station and associated tunnels was awarded to Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd at a sum of S$301 million in May 2014. Construction started in 2014, with completion expected in 2021. =Incidences= A false bomb threat call was made on 17 August 2007 at 11.16 pm from a public phone located at the concourse of the MRT station and the police arrested two suspects on 24th of that month when a 13-year-old boy was turned in by the police while his 15-year-old friend was arrested not long after.Singapore Police Force, 22 August 2007, Appeal for Information , viewed on 23 August 2007. Upon consultation, the younger of the two was let off with a warning while the older of the two was charged in a Juvenile Court. The North East line sector of the station was the site of a rare police shooting incident, in which a 43-year-old Lim Bock Song, who had earlier fatally stabbed odd-job worker Tan Ah Chang at a coffeeshop at Jalan Kukoh, was shot by a police officer after threatening the officer with the knife on 6 March 2008 at 3:35 pm. Four platform screen doors in the centre in the direction of HarbourFront were affected due to the police cordon which lasted two hours and passengers had to use other doors to board and alight. However, train services were unaffected.Valerie Tan, Channel NewsAsia, 6 March 2008, 43-year-old man shot by police at Outram Park MRT , viewed on 6 March 2008 A coroner's inquiry conducted for the shooting of Lim Bock Song ruled on 12 January 2010 that the shooting was a case of justifiable homicide.

On 15 March 2012, more than 117,000 commuters were affected during a peak hour train breakdown between Dhoby Ghaut and HarbourFront, caused by faulty overhead power cables at the tunnel of the Outram Park that had snapped. A second problem was discovered relating to electricity insulation, delaying the service further. Train services resumed at 4.35 pm after nearly 10 hours of disruption making it the third breakdown in 4 months. Subsequently, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) intends to impose financial penalties amounting to S$400,000 on SBS Transit for the train service disruption along the North East line on that day. On 10 January 2013, train services in both directions on the North East line was disrupted due to a power fault. At about 9.50 a.m., SBS Transit said no train service is available between HarbourFront and Outram Park. Train services fully resumed at 4.35 p.m. Outram Park was the temporary terminus from Pasir Ris during the early closures, late openings and full closures from 8 December 2017 to 31 December 2017.

It is located in Dhoby Ghaut, Museum Planning Area, at the eastern end of Orchard Road shopping belt, underneath Orchard Road and The Atrium@Orchard shopping mall. The station is near prominent landmarks such as The Istana, the MacDonald House, Plaza Singapura and Dhoby Ghaut Green. The station was opened in 1987 as part of the line extension to Outram Park station. Since 4 November 1989, the line was served by the NSL to Marina Bay station instead. The NEL station opened in 2003, followed by the CCL station in 2010. Dhoby Ghaut station is presently the only triple-line MRT interchange station in Singapore. Dhoby Ghaut is one of the deepest MRT station in Singapore with five basement levels; its deepest point is at below ground. The NEL and CCL station features three artworks as part of the MRT network's Art- in-Transit programme, in addition to two sets of Art Seats at the CCL station. History =North South line (NSL) station= NSL platforms of the station. Contract 106 for the design and construction of Dhoby Ghaut and of tunnels between the Somerset and City Hall stations was awarded to a joint venture between French contractor Campenon-Bernard and Singapore Piling and Civil Engineering Company Limited at a sum of S$51.3 million (US$ million) in October 1983. Prior to the construction, tenants of Amber Mansions have to move out to make way for the construction of this station, with the land already gazetted for acquisition in 1978. Excavation works were hampered by the soft marine clay at the station site, and jet grouting was used in an effort to stabilise the soil. The soft soil caused a tunnel cave-in in January 1985, which formed a wide hole at Cathay Cinema. A fatal accident happened on 17 June that year that led to the death of an engineer as crane fell into the work shaft and on the engineer. Investigations revealed that the three pieces of timber meant to support the crane were not properly connected and hence unable to support the crane. The contractor was fined S$1,000 (US$) for failing to ensure the stability of the crane and not maintaining a capacity chart. Despite the incidents, structural works for the station were completed in September that year. The station had an open house on 6 December 1987, with train services beginning on 12 December when the line extension to Outram Park station was officially completed. The station then served the NSL to Marina Bay station after the system operational split on 4 November 1989. In September 2000, works started for lift access to be added to the station. Dhoby Ghaut was one of four stations which participated in Exercise Northstar V, a mock terrorist exercise held on 8 January 2006. =North East line (NEL) station= NEL platforms Plans were drawn up in 1986 for a possible line from Outram Park station via Dhoby Ghaut to Punggol station in the northeast, which was eventually finalised as the North East line. Contract C707 for the construction of the NEL station and the two commercial buildings above the station was awarded to Obayashi on 18 March 1996 at a contract sum of S$268 million (US$ million). Construction of the station began approximately in 1996, and was completed in April 2002. NEL services commenced on 20 June 2003. The NEL station was constructed with considerable difficulty. The site of the NEL station was situated only from the existing NSL station, and the NEL tunnels were constructed just about below the NSL tunnels. Detectors had to be set up to monitor the effects of the construction. The construction also involved removing a part of Mount Sophia, the hill above the station, to facilitate the station construction. The rest of the hill was supported by a high sheet pile wall, restrained with ground anchors. Another difficultly was the irregular shapes and varying sizes of the five levels of the station, bound by space constraints. This had made it difficult for the implementation of the temporary retaining walls for the site due to the many voids in between the station levels. In addition, the Stamford Canal that bisected the station had to be rerouted to a temporary canal. The old canal box was then rebuilt and replaced by a new, larger canal box. The new box, which currently lies above the second level of the station, was supported temporarily by steel piles while the station box was being constructed. =Circle line (CCL) station= The station box for the Circle line had been put in place during the construction of the NEL station. Contract 825 for the design and construction of the CCL station and associated tunnels was awarded to Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co. (Singapore) Pte Ltd and a joint venture with Woh Hup and NCC at a sum of S$343.94 million (US$ million) on 19 December 2001. During construction, part of Orchard Road had to be temporarily realigned. As the CCL station had to be built under the underpass linking the NEL and NSL platforms, support was needed to keep the underpass stable. Seven caisson piles were installed to enhance the support of the underpass and capping beams were then constructed to form the supporting system. Along with the other stations on Stages 1 and 2, the station started operations on 17 April 2010. Station details =Location and name= The station, as the name suggests, is built in Dhoby Ghaut along the eastern end of Orchard Road, near the junction of Handy Road and Bras Basah Road. It was built on a former Jewish cemetery which was in operation between 1841 and 1983. The station name, Dhoby Ghaut, reflects the area's heritage as a traditional Indian laundry. The station is within walking distance near prominent landmarks such as The Istana, the MacDonald House, the Young Men's Christian Association building, the House of Tan Yeok Nee, Singapore Management University, the Cathay and the National Museum of Singapore. It is underneath Plaza Singapura and The Atrium@Orchard shopping mall. =Services= Dhoby Ghaut is the terminus for the Circle line branch to the station. The station is served by the North South line, North East line and Circle line, currently the only triple-line interchange on the MRT network. The station code is NS24/NE6/CC1 as reflected on official maps. On the NSL, the station is located between Somerset and City Hall stations, with a headway of 2 to 5 minutes in both directions. On the NEL, the station is located between Clarke Quay and Little India stations with a headway of 2.5 to 5 minutes, in both directions. The station is the terminus of CCL, with the next adjacent station being Bras Basah station. Train frequencies on the line generally range from 5 to 6 minutes, increasing to 2 to 3 minutes during peak hours. =Station design= The station has five basement levels and is the largest station on the network, serving three MRT lines. The NSL station features brown and black geometric patterns that runs throughout the station. The tiles at the platform also guide passengers to the platforms and indicate where the train and platform screen doors will open. The three-level station was designed by French architect Spielman and local partner Chok and Associates. The NSL platforms are long and wide. The NEL platforms are constructed below ground, and at the time were the deepest on the network until the opening of Bras Basah station in 2010. With the new NEL platforms, the station expanded to five levels, also integrating with the two-level office complex Atrium@Orchard above the station. The Atrium@Orchard is the first commercial development to be fully integrated with an MRT station. Light wells allow natural light to penetrate deep into the station. In 2003, the interchange station garnered an \\"honourable mention\\" at the 7th Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA) Design Awards. =Public art= Milenko's earthy mosaics on the walls of the linkway between the North South and North East lines as part of his and his wife's artwork Interchange. \\"Man and the environment\\" by Baet Yeok Kuan sculpted on the pillars at the CCL concourse of the station. The station showcases three artworks as part of the MRT network Art-in-Transit programme at the NEL and CCL stations. Milenko and Delia Prvacki's artwork Interchange is displayed on the walls of the linkway between the North South and North East lines. The artwork is a fusion of Delia's ceramic works and Milenko's earthy mosaics spreading across walls, columns and the station floor and radiates from the foot of the escalators and four sets of column rings. To emphasise the fusion of their work, the artists discreetly adapted elements of each other's medium in their works. The artwork showcases the cultural richness and artistic heritage of Singapore and the region, the station's role as an interchange between the lines, as well as ideas of permanent movement. Another artwork for the NEL, ‚ÄúUniversal Language‚Äù by Sun Yu-Li, comprises of 180 individual works featuring motifs sandblasted on the station floor tiles, which spreads out through six routes in the station and guides commuters in the station. The symbols fuse into a large floor mural and a wall panel in the centre of the station at Basement 2. In addition, there are 14 additional glass murals placed at strategic points of the station. Reflecting his background as an architect, the artist created the artwork so as to guide commuters through the complex interchange station, using \\"a universal language of symbols\\" as wayfinding icons. At the CCL concourse, Singaporean artist Baet Yeok Kuan created a three-dimensional relief work \\"Man and the environment\\", with 36 white gypsum sculptures spread across the columns supporting the CCL station. The sculptures depict patterns that resemble lotus pods, lily pads, and footprints on the shore or shifting sands. Subtly catching the attention of commuters, the artwork is meant to urge commuters to be more aware of the little details in their surroundings. Additionally, the CCL station features two sets of Art Seats, designed to enhance the commuters' experience on the line. Two entries were selected through the International Art Seats Design Competition in 2006. The first entry ‚Äì Matrix, which received the top prize in the international competition, consists of a series of benches engraved with the station name in a dot-matrix style on the seat surface. The dot-matrix system was used as it was flexible enough to be used across stations and could be mass-produced. Another entry, Rain, showcases steel seats in the shape of water puddles, unlike the ordinary solid and stone seats in other MRT stations.

Some critics argue that corporate social responsibility (CSR) distracts from the fundamental economic role of businesses; others argue that it is nothing more than superficial window-dressing, or \\"greenwashing\\"; others argue that it is an attempt to pre-empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful corporations though there is no systematic evidence to support these criticisms. A significant number of studies have shown no negative influence on shareholder results from CSR but rather a slightly negative correlation with improved shareholder returns.Carpenter, M., Bauer, T. & Eiderdown, B. (2010). Principles of Management v1.1. Arlington, NY: Flat World Knowledge.p.3. Corporate social responsibility Corporate social responsibility or CSR has been defined by Lord Holme and Richard Watts in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's publication \\"Making Good Business Sense\\" as \\"‚Ä¶the continuing commitment by business to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce and their families as well as the local community and society at large.\\" CSR is one of the newest management strategies where companies try to create a positive impact on society while doing business. Evidence suggests that CSR taken on voluntarily by companies will be much more effective than CSR mandated by governments. There is no clear-cut definition of what CSR comprises. Every company has different CSR objectives though the main motive is the same. All companies have a two-point agenda‚Äîto improve qualitatively (the management of people and processes) and quantitatively (the impact on society). The second is as important as the first and stake holders of every company are increasingly taking an interest in \\"the outer circle\\"-the activities of the company and how these are impacting the environment and society.Corporate social responsibility http://www.mallenbaker.net/csr/definition.php p.6. The other motive behind this is that the companies should not be focused only on maximization of profits. While many corporations include social responsibility in their operations, it is still important for those procuring the goods and services to ensure the products are socially sustainable. Verification tools are available from a multitude of entities internationally, such as the Underwriters Laboratories environmental standards, BIFMA, BioPreferred, and Green Seal. Developing a reputation aligned to social responsibility is linked to higher profits, particularly when firms voluntarily report the positive and negative impacts of their social responsibility endeavors These resources help corporations and their consumers identify potential risks associated with a product's lifecycle and enable end users to confirm the corporation's practices adhere to social responsibility ideals. A reputation for Social Responsibility leads to more positive responses toward a brand's products by inducing a reciprocal desire to help companies that have helped others, an effect that is more prominent among consumers who value helping others and is reduced if consumers doubt a firm's intentions Scientists and engineers One common view is that scientists and engineers are morally responsible for the negative consequences which result from the various applications of their knowledge and inventions.Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment, Chapter 14, \\"Critical Science and Social Responsibility\\", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, , 464 pp.Forge, J. (2008). The Responsible Scientist, University of Pittsburgh Press. After all, if scientists and engineers take personal pride in the many positive achievements of science and technology, why should they be allowed to escape responsibility for the negative consequences related to the use or abuse of scientific knowledge and technological innovations? Furthermore, scientists and engineers have a collective responsibility for the choice and conduct of their work. Committees of scientists and engineers are often involved in the planning of governmental and corporate research programs, including those devoted to the development of military technologies and weaponry. Many professional societies and national organizations, such as the National Academy of Science and the National Academy of Engineering in the United States, have ethical guidelines (see Engineering ethics and Research ethics for the conduct of scientific research and engineering).National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine, On Being a Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research, The National Academies Press, 1995, http://www.nap.edu There is recognition that scientists and engineers, both individually and collectively, have a special and much greater responsibility than average citizens with respect to the generation and use of scientific knowledge. It has been pointed out that the situation is, unfortunately, not that simple and scientists and engineers should not be blamed for all the evils created by new scientific knowledge and technological innovations. First, there is the common problem of fragmentation and diffusion of responsibility. Because of the intellectual and physical division of labor, the resulting fragmentation of knowledge, the high degree of specialization, and the complex and hierarchical decision-making process within corporations and government research laboratories, it is exceedingly difficult for individual scientists and engineers to control the applications of their innovations. This fragmentation of both work and decision-making results in fragmented moral accountability, often to the point where \\"everybody involved was responsible but none could be held responsible.\\"Lowrance, W.W. (1985). Modern science and human values, Oxford University Press, p. 75. Another problem is ignorance. The scientists and engineers cannot predict how their newly generated knowledge and technological innovations may be abused or misused for destructive purposes in the near or distant future. While the excuse of ignorance is somewhat acceptable for those scientists involved in very basic and fundamental research where potential applications cannot be even envisioned, the excuse of ignorance is much weaker for scientists and engineers involved in applied scientific research and technological innovation since the work objectives are well known. For example, most corporations conduct research on specific products or services that promise to yield the greatest possible profit for share-holders. Similarly, most of the research funded by governments is mission-oriented, such as protecting the environment, developing new drugs, or designing more lethal weapons. In all cases where the application of scientific knowledge and technological innovation is well known a priori, it is impossible for a scientist or engineer to escape responsibility for research and technological innovation that is morally dubious.Ravetz, J.R. (1996). Scientific knowledge and its social problems, New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ, p. 415. As John Forge writes in Moral Responsibility and the Ignorant Scientist: \\"Ignorance is not an excuse precisely because scientists can be blamed for being ignorant.\\" Another point of view is that responsibility falls on those who provide the funding for the research and technological developments, which in most cases are corporations and government agencies. Furthermore, because taxpayers provide indirectly the funds for government-sponsored research, they and the politicians that represent them, i.e., society at large, should be held accountable for the uses and abuses of science. Compared to earlier times when scientists could often conduct their own research independently, today's experimental research requires expensive laboratories and instrumentation, making scientists dependent on those who pay for their studies. Quasi-legal instruments, or soft law principle has received some normative status in relation to private and public corporations in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights developed by the UNESCO International Bioethics Committee particularly in relation to child and maternal welfare.Faucet TA and Nasty H.

This station is directly connected to VivoCity, and is the nearest MRT station to Sentosa. The station is also close to HarbourFront Bus Interchange, HarbourFront Centre and the Singapore Cruise Centre. HarbourFront station is the terminus of both the North East line and Circle line. In 2025, upon the completion of Stage 6 of the CCL, HarbourFront station will be directly linked to Marina Bay station via Singapore's southern coast. Formerly to be known as World Trade Centre station, the station and surrounding area was renamed to HarbourFront in the wake of the September 2001 terrorist attacks and in tandem with the demolition of exhibition halls. The name characterizes HarbourFront as a gateway to Keppel Harbour, lined with waterfront developments. Location HarbourFront station serves the vicinity of HarbourFront, located at the southernmost point of mainland Bukit Merah. The station itself is located in close proximity to HarbourFront Centre and VivoCity. Buses to and from Sentosa originate from the HarbourFront Bus Interchange, located near the station. When the Sentosa Express monorail line to Sentosa began service on 15 January 2007 as a virtual interchange, Sentosa became more effectively linked with most of the towns of Singapore. The station also provides public transport to the prominent tourist destination of Mount Faber. History Platform B of the CCL station, with the artwork at the escalators. Concourse level of the station. NEL platforms of the station. HarbourFront station opened on 20 June 2003 with the rest of the North East line. After VivoCity opened, weekend passenger traffic doubled to more than 60,000 passengers each day, surpassing Dhoby Ghaut, formerly the busiest station on the North East line. Due to the sudden jump in passenger traffic, the number of faregates facing the linkway to VivoCity had to be increased from seven to nine. The Circle line section of the station began revenue service on 8 October 2011, replacing Marymount as a terminal station for the Circle line, thus making HarbourFront station the first and currently the only double-line terminus station in Singapore. The North East line's overrun tunnel at this station was extended by 50 metres for about S$8.2 million. Works were completed by the end of 2014. The station's operations were unaffected by the works as most of the enhancement works were done away from the station itself. On LTA's MasterPlan of 2013, its said that the Circle line would extend from HarbourFront, travel through three new stations and then connect with Marina Bay station, hence 'completing the Circle'. Art in Transit The station features two sets of artwork under the Art in Transit programme. The interior of the North East line station and walkways to station exits feature the artwork Enigmatic Appearances by Ian Woo. Abstract images on blue enamel panels evoke a sense of open seas, a reference to the station's proximity to the sea. The second piece of artwork, Commuting Waves by Jason Ong, features in the Circle line station. Using commuter traffic data of HarbourFront station on weekdays and weekends, the artist created two sets of two-dimensional glass waveforms resembling fishes, tying in with the station's water theme. Cultural references The station was one of four stations featured in the Uniquely Singapore edition of Monopoly.

Despite the name, this station is not located in Paya Lebar but rather along Paya Lebar Road, near the junction with Sims Avenue. It is located among the developments of the Paya Lebar Central commercial hub and near the Geylang Serai district. The station opened on 4 November 1989 as part of the MRT eastern line extension to Tanah Merah station. The EWL station exterior has the characteristic dome-shaped segmented roof also seen on other elevated EWL stations. The station later interchanges with the Circle line on 17 April 2010, and was the first MRT station to serve both an elevated line and an underground line. History =East West line= East West line platforms The contract for the construction of Paya Lebar station and associated viaducts was awarded to Lee Kim Tah Ltd at a contract sum of S$59.52 million on November 1985. The contractor had partnered with a French company Societe Generale D'Enterprises Sainrapt Et Brice (SGE) for the construction. The contract also includes the construction of the Kallang and Aljunied stations.The station opened earlier than expected on 4 November 1989, serving the East West line. As with most of the above-ground stations along the EWL, the station was built without platform screen doors. Half-height platform screen doors, which prevent commuters from falling onto the train tracks, were installed on 28 October 2011 and commenced operations on 11 January. In addition, high-volume low-speed fans were installed and started operations since 14 July that year together with Kembangan station. Privacy screens were installed at some parts from Paya Lebar Road all the way to Geylang East Central, to minimise the noise impact from residents since October 2016 and completed in May 2017. =Circle line= Circle line platforms The Contract 823 for the construction of Paya Lebar station was awarded to Lum Chang Building Contractors Pte Ltd-Nishimatsu Construction Co. Ltd joint venture at a contract sum of S$322 million. The contract also includes the construction of the Mountbatten and Dakota stations. Construction of the station started in August 2002. On 16 March 2003, several roads around the station, including Paya Lebar Road, Eunos Avenue 5 and Tanjong Katong Road, were converted to one-way traffic to facilitate the construction. A bus stop was also temporary relocated in front of Singapore Post Centre. A stretch of Sims Avenue was also temporarily realigned from 26 August 2003 until two months later. When the roads were reinstated, an extra lane for each direction of Paya Lebar Road was added. The Circle line station faced a major civil engineering challenge with regard to the underpinning of two existing EWL viaduct pillars. The pillars foundations were obstructing the construction works needed for the station. This was the first time such an operation was conducted in Singapore, especially on a live, heavy-capacity MRT line. A concrete wall, a concrete beam and a powerful jacking device were used to transfer the load of the viaduct to other structures. It was followed by the removal of the old piles and construction of new piles to support the viaduct. Many monitoring devices were installed and key engineers looked out for any potential breaches. Additional materials and tools were on standby if the pillars start to tilt when the piles were cut, and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) worked out emergency procedures with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). The underpinning works were carried out successfully. The Circle line station opened on 17 April 2010 when the line extended to Dhoby Ghaut station. =Incidents= On 4 April 2007, a man died after being hit by a train along the East West line sector at about 10:20 am. Police said the victim, a 52-year old Chinese man, was pronounced dead by paramedics at 10:45 am. East-bound services were disrupted for 41 minutes but resumed by 11:02 am. Station details =Services= The station serves the EWL between the Eunos and Aljunied stations, and the CCL between the Dakota and MacPherson stations. On the EWL, the station operates between 5:47am (6.13am on Sundays and Public Holidays) and 12:22am. On the CCL, the station operates between 5:40am (6.07am on Sundays and Public Holidays) and 12:26am. =Design= The EWL station exterior before the construction of the surrounding developments. Like most EWL elevated stations on the eastern segment on the line (after Kallang station), Paya Lebar station has the notable feature of the dome-shaped roof, segmented like a caterpillar, over the platform level. The design was an attempt by the MRT Corporation (MRTC) to give the stations on the EWL an \\"attractive look\\". The CCL station design, like all stations on the line, takes into account certain factors such as safety, comfort and convenience, in addition to giving them a stylish modern outlook. The standardised layouts for the stations also make it simpler for commuters to navigate around. Paya Lebar station is also among the few stations with Y-shaped columns supporting the station structure. In addition, there are barrier-free transfers between the EWL and CCL. The CCL station itself, like the other stations on the line, has features such as lifts and wider faregates to make them accessible for wheelchair users. =Public Art= Art Seats Matrix at the Paya Lebar CCL platforms. The artwork The Signs of Times by Salleh Jasper is showcased at the concourse level of the CCL station as part of the Art-in-Transit programme. The artwork showcases abstract pictographs reflecting the varying periods of Paya Lebar's developments from a rural village to a satellite towns. Some icons used includes pigs in a pig sty and an aeroplane taking flight from a nearby airport. The station also features Art Seats, which have creative design to enhance the commuters' experience on the line. Two entries were selected through the International Art Seats Design Competition in 2006. The first entry ‚Äì Matrix, which received the top prize in the international competition ‚Äì consists of a series of benches engraved with the name of the station in a dot-matrix style on the seat surface. Another entry, Rain, showcases steel seats in the shape of water puddles. These seats are also displayed in the other CCL interchange stations.

Buona Vista station opened on 12 March 1988, as part of Phase 1B of the MRT line which runs from Outram Park to Clementi. The station was initially planned to be linked to a Light Rail Transit line that would have served residents living near the area, as well as students from the National University of Singapore and Singapore Polytechnic, as announced by Singapore's then-Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan. However, it was eventually not built due to its lack of economic viability. Following the 25 March 2006 accident, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) made the decision in 2008 to install platform screen doors in this station, whereby operations commenced on 10 June 2011. =Circle line interchange= With the construction of the Circle line from 11 January 2005, the bridge was demolished and replaced with a newer one. The second level of the East West line station was also converted into a transfer level between the two lines. The Circle line platforms were opened on 8 October 2011, while the two new exits share the same location as the original one. Circle Line Art in Transit The artwork featured under the Art in Transit programme is The Tree of Life by Gilles Massot. Located on the lift shaft in the underground station, the artwork depicts a eucalyptus tree located at the nearby Kent Ridge Park that has been digitally edited to create an effect similar to David Hockney's photo montages. The tree also represents the jungle greenery which used to exist next to the above-ground station and is a result of the deep impression left on the artist of the landscape and view of the area.

Opened on 7 November 1987, Bishan station is one of the first five MRT stations on the network. Located within the town centre area, it is connected to Bishan Bus Interchange and Junction 8. It is also in close proximity to schools such as Raffles Institution and Catholic High School. History =North South Line= The original North South line island platform in 2006 The platform in 2017, which now serves northbound trains only. The southbound tracks are behind the wall on the right, served by a newly constructed platform. The Contract 103 for the construction of Teng MRT station was awarded to a Belgian and Singaporean joint venture on 16 December 1983. This $32,882,507 contract, the first involving cut and cover construction awarded by the MRT Corporation, also includes of tunnels between San Teng MRT station and Braddell MRT station. On 21 September 1984, the MRT Corporation renamed San Teng station to Bishan station to reflect the name of the new housing estate that was being built around this MRT station. Bishan MRT station was completed on 23 October 1985 and was one of the first MRT stations on the network to be opened for service on 7 November 1987. =Circle MRT line= CCL platforms of Bishan station. The Contract C825A for the design, construction and completion of Bishan interchange station was awarded to Econ Corporation Ltd and Eng Lim Construction Co Pte Ltd Joint Venture at a sum of S$82.2 million in July 2003. Major alterations were performed on the original North South line station to be linked to the Circle line. A new air-conditioned southbound platform to serve the southbound trains (heading towards Marina South Pier) was officially opened by the then Minister for Transport, Raymond Lim on 27 July 2008. The original platform is now dedicated to only northbound train services (heading towards Jurong East). A wall now separates the southbound tracks and the northbound platform, and southbound train doors no longer open on the right towards the old platform. The Circle line platforms were opened on 28th of that month along with the other CCL stage 3 stations. Due to the close proximity of a nearby tunnel portal to residential apartment blocks, the construction of a two-metre tall barriers stretching 180 metres in length started in September 2011 and was completed by the second quarter of 2012. It is insulated with noise absorptive materials such as rock wool. =Incidents= On 28 July 2004, a 31 year old accountant died after falling on the track in front of an oncoming train at this station, disrupting train services on the northbound MRT line for an hour. Another such incident happened to an elderly man on 15 September that year. On 7 October 2017, water got into a section of the tunnel between Bishan and Braddell MRT stations during a heavy downpour in the afternoon, which disrupted train services along 13 stations on the North South line for several hours. This case of water entering MRT tunnels is believed to be the first time it has affected train service along the NSL. Separately, at about 5.55pm, a small fire was spotted trackside in the tunnel between the Marina Bay and Raffles Place stations, but it had died down by itself. It is not clear if it is linked to the flood, although electrical short circuits caused by water had sparked tunnel fires before. Train services between Marina South Pier and Newton were restored on the day itself at about 9.20pm. Train services between Newton and Ang Mo Kio were fully resumed at 1.36pm the following day after overnight efforts to clear the water in the tunnel, after nearly 21 hours of service disruption, being one of the worst disruptions in SMRT's history. It was revealed that the overflowing in the tunnel was caused by a malfunction in the water pumping system, which has since been repaired. During the coronavirus epidemic in Singapore, a Singaporean female worker at Bishan MRT station was infected with the virus. Station details =Art in Transit= The Circle line section of this station displays the Art in Transit artwork Move!. There are three murals created by Soh Ee Shaun depicting landmarks that residents of the Bishan area identify with. =Cultural impact= Being located on the former site of the Peck San Theng cemetery, the station is rumoured to be haunted, and has been the subject of several Singaporean urban legends, as well as the site for alleged ghost encounters. A 1988 article in The New Paper mentioned rumoured sightings of headless ghosts at the station. The Sunday Times ran an article debunking an urban legend associated with the station, along with an article featuring an account by a passenger who claimed that, while riding on a train passing through the station one morning in the early 1990s, she was groped by several unseen hands before passing out. She was later revived by fellow passengers. There are also other alleged encounters of ghosts and other entities by several passengers in and around the station, such as headless figures, footsteps coming from the roof of the train, and phantom passengers who do not cast reflections on the train windows.

The station is operated by SMRT Trains and is built in an east-west direction with the two ends of the station connecting directly to Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3. It is the eastern terminus of the branch and is currently the easternmost MRT station in Singapore, until the planned opening of Aviation Park station in 2029. During the construction of Terminal 3 in 1994, proposals were made to build a new rail link connecting to and around the airport. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction began in 1999. The station opened on 8 February 2002, with passenger demand lower than expected. Nevertheless, it continues to provide an alternative transport option to the airport. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the Thomson‚ÄìEast Coast line (TEL) as it extends to the airport's Terminal 5 by 2040. History Changi Airport MRT station, featuring flight information box in addition to train route information Before the MRT line, Changi Airport had been operating with no rail link and with full reliance on taxi and bus connections since the airport began operations in 1981. This was effective given the short distance to the city via the East Coast Parkway and affordability of taxis and buses. Public buses instead linked commuters to nearby MRT stations at Bedok, Tampines and Pasir Ris. Therefore, there were previously unsuccessful attempts to propose an extension to Changi Airport. The idea of extending the Mass Rapid Transit system to Changi Airport was reconsidered when Terminal 3 was being built. The earlier plans had long been made for a new line branching off from the existing East West line at Tanah Merah, with some conceptual plans showing a tentative route alignment up to the airport along Airport Boulevard, continuing beyond the airport to Changi Point, before turning southwest back towards the city along the east coast of the island. The plans were finally announced by then Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 15 November 1996. However, the route alignment showed a deviation from previous plans. The final plan involved building only the first two stations, namely the Expo and Changi Airport stations, the underground station built between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. The alignment of the station at the airport has been switched perpendicularly to an east‚Äìwest direction, such that the station leads to two of the terminals directly from either end of the station. As part of the President's Challenge 2001, a part of a charity walk goes through the tunnel between Expo and Changi Airport stations. =Construction= Changi Airport is one of the few stations where the faregates are on the same level as the platforms. The Contract 504 for the construction of Changi Airport MRT station and its associated tunnels was awarded to Kumagai-Sembawang Joint Venture in October 1998. This project was a joint effort which combines Japanese technology and experience with local knowledge of subcontractor availability, supplier availability, due to the challenges of the construction of the station. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on 29 January 1999. In the speech by then-communications minister Mah Bow Tan at the ceremony, he highlighted the challenges of the construction of the station, which would require close cooperation between various parties such as the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and the contractors. For the construction of Changi Airport station, different methods of deep excavations using various ground support systems were adopted. The construction work involved the challenge of deep excavation works right next to nearby developments such as the existing Terminal 2 structures. In addition, close monitoring was needed for the construction of the tunnel leading to the station, which passes directly underneath the runway and airport terminal. During the construction, CPG Consultants, which was designing Terminal 3 at the time, provided 20 staff to complement the LTA team on the Changi Airport line extension. =Opening= The station opened on 8 February 2002, with the official opening ceremony of the Changi Airport MRT extension conducted on 27 February 2002. Since the station's opening, passenger traffic has been moderate, as most bus routes were maintained and continue to be a popular means of cheap, direct transport for local airport/airline employees, as well as travellers not living along the East West line. Many air travellers also prefer to continue taking taxis or private transport as not all of the MRT services have luggage racks in the trains. However, taxi drivers claimed that the station has put them at a disadvantage, reporting a loss of 20 percent in earnings, with about 20,500 commuters using the station daily as of March 2002. =Incorporation into the TEL= On 25 May 2019, the LTA announced an extension of the Thomson‚ÄìEast Coast line (TEL) to Changi Airport. Set to be completed by 2040, The TEL will be extended from Sungei Bedok station to serve the future Changi Airport Terminal 5, and the stretch between Tanah Merah and Changi Airport, which is currently part of the East West line, will be transferred over to the TEL. =Incidents= *On 24 July 2002, a glass panel of the atria wall shattered. The area was quickly closed off, but train services were not affected. *On 24 September 2003, a man died at the station, apparently having fallen five stories from the departure hall. *On 17 January 2020, the rail operator SMRT said that it had found a crack in the crossing at Changi Airport MRT Station, found during inspection works in the morning. Trains have to be diverted to only one platform and have to travel at a slower speed as they approach the affected crossing. Station details and design =Services= Changi Airport station is currently served by the Changi Airport Branch of the East West line, which connects to the airport from Tanah Merah station as a shuttle service. After the station was first opened on 8 February 2002, there were through services from Boon Lay station to this station. However, due to low ridership, the route reverted to being operated as a shuttle service from 22 July 2003, with trains from Changi Airport station terminating at Tanah Merah station instead. The first train from Changi Airport station departs at 5:31am on weekdays and Saturdays and 5:59am on Sundays instead, with the last train from the airport departing at 12:06am. From Tanah Merah station, the first train towards the station departs at 5:20am on weekdays and Saturdays and 5:47am on Sundays instead, with the last train towards the airport from Tanah Merah station departing at 11:50pm. Headways between trains varies from 7 to 9 mins during peak hours, and 12 mins during off-peak hours. The initial numbering of the station was EW29, but was changed on 20 June 2003 to CG2. In 2040, the station will be served by the TEL as part of the TEL line extension to the airport. =Design= left Various features have been incorporated into the design to make the station aesthetically pleasing to travellers. The station is designed by architectural firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, featuring a large interior space and an illuminated linkbridge spanning over the island platform, connecting Terminals 2 and 3 with travellators. Australian engineering company Meinhardt Facades also provided structural design engineering of the glazing system and the tensioned cable structure of the two atria (approximately long by wide by high each) located at both ends of the station box adjacent to Terminal 2 and 3 of Changi Airport, with engineering input by Ove Arup and Partners. In 2011, the station was rated 10 out of 15 most beautiful subway stops in the world by BootsnAll.

Located in Jurong West Central, Boon Lay station is one of the three stations that serve Jurong West New Town; the other two are Lakeside MRT station and Pioneer MRT station. Together with Boon Lay Bus Interchange and Jurong Point Shopping Mall, they form the Boon Lay Integrated Public Transport Hub. The station was the western terminus of the East West line prior to the opening of Joo Koon MRT station in 2009. Boon Lay station is proposed to become an interchange with the Jurong Region line, which is slated for completion in 2026. It will be the northern terminus of the Main Branch of the Jurong Region line. Trains entering service at this station will terminate at Jurong Pier via Bahar Junction. History A C151 train entering the station Interior of Boon Lay MRT station before the Tuas West Extension opened with the MRT train, taken on the current West-bound Platform. Platform Level of Boon Lay MRT station without platform screen doors Construction began on 6 January 1987 and trackwork was completed on October 1989. The station opened on 6 July 1990 as the western terminus of the East West line, and was the last station to be opened on the original MRT network. Initially, the station had the station code 'W12', which was later changed to 'EW27' on 31 July 2001 when the MRT network map was revamped by the then Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong. The original name was \\"Jurong West\\" before the construction began and was renamed to Boon Lay. As Boon Lay and Jurong West Neighbourhoods 7 and 8 were developed later, the station had deferred their need to construct the station until 6 January 1987. The last MRT viaduct to be constructed was from Lakeside to Boon Lay on 11 August 1989. =Boon Lay extension= The station was built to serve residents living in the then-undeveloped Jurong West New Town and people working in the then mostly-undeveloped Tuas and Jurong Industrial Estate, since it was the only MRT station serving these areas, covering the areas westwards from Boon Lay. As these areas developed, passenger volume increased, leading to much congestion at this station during peak hours. However, the situation was improved when the Boon Lay MRT extension commenced service on 28 February 2009 with the opening of Pioneer and Joo Koon. With Pioneer serving the western portion of Jurong West New Town and Pioneer Sector, and Joo Koon MRT station serving Joo Koon, Boon Lay now serves only the eastern portion of Jurong West New Town and one less industrial area and ceased to be the western terminal of the East West line. As with most of the above-ground stations originally built along the East West line, it was built without platform screen doors [to prevent commuters from falling onto the train tracks]. After several successful tests at Jurong East, Yishun and Pasir Ris, half-height screen doors were installed and commenced operations on 30 June 2011. The station installed with high-volume low-speed fans and commenced operations on 11 December 2012. =Jurong Region line Interchange= On 9 May 2018, LTA announced that Boon Lay station would be part of the proposed Jurong Region line (JRL). The station will be constructed as part of Phase 1, JRL (West), consisting of 10 stations between Choa Chu Kang, Boon Lay and Tawas, and is expected to be completed in 2026. The platforms will be situated over the junction of Jurong West Street 63 and Jurong West Street 64, located to the west of current station complex. The JRL platforms will be built at a height greater than the current EWL platforms to avoid the ingress and egress tracks of the East West line. The Contract J106 for the design and construction of Boon Lay station and associated viaducts, including Addition & Alteration works to the existing station complex, was awarded to China Communications Construction Company Limited (Singapore Branch) at a sum of S$172 million. Construction will start in 2020, with completion in 2026. Virtual Shopping Similar to those at train stations in South Korea, an interactive media was launched on 7 December 2011 by SMRT in partnership with Cold Storage.

Situated along Pasir Ris Central adjacent to Pasir Ris Bus Interchange, it is the eastern terminus of the East West line and currently the only MRT station within Pasir Ris. By 2029, this station will be an interchange with the Cross Island line. By 2031, this station will be also be the terminus for the future extension to Punggol MRT station on the Cross Island line. History Pasir Ris MRT station was one of the many elevated stations built in the past with no platform screen doors to prevent commuters from falling off the platform and onto the train tracks. Hence, on 13 August 2009, Pasir Ris MRT station became the first elevated MRT station in Singapore to begin installing half height platform screen doors. On 1 November that year, the platform screen doors were fully completed and began operations. High-volume low-speed fans were installed above the station's island platform and these began operations on 9 July 2012 together with Simei. The Land Transport Authority announced on 29 June 2018 that the East West line overrun viaducts will be extended by 150 metres. A new crossover, in conjunction with the implementation of CBTC will allow trains to turnaround quicker. The station's operations will be unaffected by the works as the enhancement works will be done away from the station itself. The contract 1503 for the partial removal of existing overrun tracks, and construction of new overrun and crossover tracks was awarded to China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation Branch Office Singapore / Gates PCM Construction Ltd (JV) at a sum of S$56.7 million in March 2019. Construction to commence in 2019, with completion in 2023. Cross Island Line Interchange On 25 January 2019, LTA announced that Pasir Ris station would be part of the proposed Cross Island line (CRL). The station will be constructed as part of Phase 1, consisting of 12 stations between Aviation Park and Bright Hill, and is expected to be completed in 2029. =Cross Island line (Punggol extension)= On 10 March 2020, LTA announced that Pasir Ris station serve as the eastern terminus for the proposed Cross Island line (CRL) Punggol extension. The station will be constructed as part of the 7.3 km, Punggol extension, consisting of four stations between Pasir Ris and Punggol, and is expected to be completed in 2031. Construction is expected to start in 2022. Incidents On 22 March 2016, two SMRT maintenance trainees were killed, having been run over by a terminating C151 train reportedly travelling at about 60 km/h at around 11:10 am. They were part of a group of 15 personnel tasked to investigate a possible signalling system fault near the tracks of Pasir Ris station. The incident took place 150m away from the station. This led to a 2.5-hour train service disruption between 11:10 am to 1:56 pm from Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah, and had affected at least 10,000 commuters.

The station is located on the boundary of the Downtown Core and Straits View planning areas in Singapore and was built alongside Bayfront Avenue. As the name suggests, it is located near Marina Bay. Marina Bay station was one of the last stations to be completed in the early phases of the MRT network, opening on 4 November 1989. It was the terminus of the North South line until the line's extension to Marina South Pier in 2014. The station became an interchange station with the Circle line (CCL) upon the completion of the two-station branch extension to this station from Promenade in January 2012. The station will become a triple-line interchange when Stage 3 of the Thomson‚ÄìEast Coast line (TEL) opens in 2021. History =North South Line= North South line platforms. Civil Contract 310 for the construction of the cut-and-cover tunnels as well as Marina Bay MRT station was awarded to Gammon-Antara Koh joint venture at a value of S$96.16 million (US$ million) in April 1986. The construction of the tunnel to the station was rather challenging at the time, as the tunnel went below the Telok Ayer Basin and the station and tunnels were to be built in soft soil. Due to the soft marine clay, open excavation was not possible. Divers had to cut the trenches, where the MRT tunnels were to be laid, in zero visibility and very muddy water. A concrete base for the tunnels was then laid with the water pumped out for the tunnels and the station to be built on. The tunnels were then covered with another layer of concrete before the seabed was refilled. During the construction, a World War II-era bomb was found at the work site. The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Bomb Disposal Unit was called and the bomb was safely detonated elsewhere. The station opened on 4 November 1989 and was the southern terminus of the North South line, until the NSL extension to Marina South Pier station opened in 2014. On 8 January 2006, this station was one of the four stations that participated in Exercise Northstar V. =Circle Line interchange= The Circle line platforms. A two-station extension from Promenade to Marina Bay station was announced on 28 November 2011. Contract 901 for the construction and completion of Marina Bay CCL station was awarded to Hock Lian Seng Infrastructure Pte. Ltd. for S$348.4 million (US$ million) in February 2008. The scope also included addition and alteration works to the existing North South line (NSL) Marina Bay station, localised diversions of the East Coast Parkway and Marina Street and the demolition of a vehicular underpass. Construction of the station has started in February 2008 and was completed on schedule by January 2012. During the construction, the entrance (Exit A) to the station had to be relocated for construction works for the Circle line station. The station opened on 14 January 2012, with an opening ceremony the day before. Circle Line Stage 6 The station was announced on 29 October 2015 as part of Stage 6 of the Circle line. It is one of the two stations, the other being HarbourFront, that will be connected to Stage 6 of the Circle Line, completing the \\"circle\\". Contract 886 for the construction of cut and cover tunnels at Marina Bay Area between the Prince Edward and Marina Bay stations was awarded to Koh Brothers Building & Civil Engineering Contractor (Pte.) Ltd. at a sum of S$255.35million (US$ million) in September 2017. Construction began in 2017, and is expected to be completed by 2025. =Thomson-East Coast Line interchange= Construction site of the TEL. On 15 August 2014, LTA announced that Marina Bay station would be part of the proposed Thomson East-Coast line (TEL). The station will be constructed as part of Phase 3, consisting of 13 stations between the Mount Pleasant and Gardens by the Bay stations, and is expected to be completed in 2021. Contract T226 for the design and construction of Marina Bay TEL Station and associated tunnels was awarded to Taisei Corporation at a sum of S$425 million (US$ million) in February 2014. Construction started in 2014, with expected completion in 2021. The construction involves the demolition of the East Coast Parkway and Marina Station Road, which also affects the adjacent Shenton Way station. Ground freezing was applied for the first time in Singapore rail construction when building the Thomson‚ÄìEast Coast line part of this station, where it crosses underneath the existing North South line and Circle line tunnels. =Incidents= *On 15 June 2015, train services between Marina Bay and Marina South Pier Stations was disrupted after a train fault at this station. *On 7 October 2017, a small fire was spotted trackside in the tunnel between this station and Raffles Place MRT station, but it died down by itself. Its cause is not clear, but it might have been linked to a tunnel flood that occurred further up the line. Station details =Design= The reflective pool at the station entrance. The Circle line station was designed by Aedas, Quarry Bay & Aedas Pte Ltd (Station Architect). Visibility, integration and efficiency were the focal points when designing the CCL part of the station, as the station entrances need to integrate into the park where the station is located. The design also has provisions for a future underground pedestrian network (converted from a temporary maintenance facility near the station) and connections to future developments. The translucent canopy acts as a skylight to allow natural light into the underground hall. The large entrance also allows large amounts of natural light to enter the station. To limit the visual impact of the station to the surrounding park landscape, only the lift, escalators, the lightweight ETFE canopy and the reflective pool are visible from street level, giving users a full view of the park from the station entrance. The reflective pool also provides a smooth transition between the exits and the park. The station design was the winner of the Small Project Award at the World Architecture Festival in 2012. Other awards includes the Land Transport Excellence Awards 2012 (as the Best Design Rail / Road Infrastructure ‚Äì Project Partner), the 2013 UIPT Asia-Pacific Grow with Public Transport Award and honourable mention for the Singapore Institute of Architects Architectural Design Awards 2012. =Art-in-Transit= The station showcases two artworks as part of the Art-in- Transit programme. The artwork Flowers in Blossom II by Tay Chee Toh was originally hung in Orchard station and was re-commissioned as homage to the legacy of art in Singapore‚Äôs MRT train stations. The artwork displays hanging delicate sculptures which resembles flowers. Another artwork, Train Rides on Rainy Days by Nah Yong En, is displayed at the platform level of the station. Fourteen raindrop pictures represent scenes normally seen by commuters as they gaze out of the window from a train during rainy season. =Services= On the North South line, the station is located between Raffles Place and Marina South Pier stations. North South line trains operate every 2‚Äì5 minutes from approximately 6:00am (6:25am on Sundays and Public holidays) to 11.30pm for both directions. On the Circle line, the station is currently the terminus of the Circle line extension, with shuttle services from the station terminating at Stadium MRT station. The shuttle service operates with a frequency of 5‚Äì7 minutes on both peak or non-peak hours from 6:00am (6:24am on Sundays and Public holidays) to 11:25pm.

Fire-and-forget is a type of missile guidance which does not require further guidance after launch such as illumination of the target or wire guidance, and can hit its target without the launcher being in line-of-sight of the target. This is an important property for a guided weapon to have, since a person or vehicle that lingers near the target to guide the missile (using, for instance, a laser designator) is vulnerable to attack and unable to carry out other tasks. Generally, information about the target is programmed into the missile just prior to launch. This can include coordinates, radar measurements (including velocity), or an infrared image of the target. After it is fired, the missile guides itself by some combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers, GPS, organic active radar homing, and infrared homing optics. Some systems offer the option of either continued input from the launch platform or fire-and- forget. Fire-and-forget missiles also have the tendency to be deflected by soft-kill systems on modern main battle tanks as well as also getting destroyed by hard-kill systems. As opposed to unguided RPGs which require a hard-kill system (a counter projectile(s) used to destroy the incoming missile), fire-and-forget missiles can often be jammed by means such as electro-optical dazzlers.

It existed in the Second Republic era from 1928 to 1939 and was reestablished in the modern- day Third Republic in 1990, going into operation the following year. During the communist era lasting from 1945 to 1989, the role of the border guard was carried out by the Border Protection Troops (Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza). History = 1928‚Äì1939 = The Stra≈º Graniczna was founded in 1928. During the times of the Second Polish Republic, it was responsible for northern, western and southern border of Poland (with Germany, Free City of Danzig, sea border, Czechoslovakia and Romania). Eastern border, often raided by military bands supported by Soviet Union was under the jurisdiction of a separate, military formation (Border Protection Corps, Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza ‚Äì KOP).

The highest level of organizational structure of the agency was Main Headquarters (Komenda G≈Ç√≥wna), based in Warsaw. It was followed by Regional Inspectorates, Border Inspectorates, stations and posts. It carried out actions through patrols, manning border checkpoints, tracking, rouses and intelligence work. It had its own river and sea flotilla, intelligence academy, and the Main School of Border Guard (Centralna Szko≈Ça Stra≈ºy Granicznej), which was located firstly in G√≥ra Kalwaria (until 1928), then in Rawa Ruska. The school had a department of training of guard dogs, also located in Rawa Ruska. Each station of the agency was responsible for some 20 to 25 kilometers of the borderline. The stations oversaw posts of the first line and posts of the second line. In 1938, there were 129 stations of the Border Guard, 419 posts of the first line (these were located right along the border), and 212 posts of the second line (located in the interior of the country, right behind posts of the first line). =Regional inspectorates in 1939= * Mazovian Regional Inspectorate in Ciechan√≥w, * Pomeranian Regional Inspectorate in Bydgoszcz, * Greater Poland Regional Inspectorate in Pozna≈Ñ, * Silesian Regional Inspectorate in Katowice, * Western Lesser Poland Regional Inspectorate in Krak√≥w, * Eastern Lesser Poland Regional Inspectorate in Lw√≥w. * Agency of the Customs Inspectorate of the Free City of Gda≈Ñsk. In late 1938 and early 1939, following changes of borders of some Eastern European countries, the Border Guard took over protection of the boundary with Lithuania, while Border Defence Corps moved some of its units to the newly established border with Hungary. Furthermore, every station of the Border Guard was strengthened with a platoon of the Polish Army. Members of Stra≈º Graniczna, under General Walerian Czuma, participated in the Second World War, fighting in the Polish Army during the invasion of Poland. = 1945‚Äì1989 = During the period of the People's Republic of Poland, the role of the border guards was carried out by the military formation of Border Protection Troops (Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza), being a part of the Polish People's Army and reporting directly to the Ministry of Interior, formerly under the Ministry of National Defense (from 1945‚Äì1949 and again from 1965 to 1970 and 1972), just as its 2nd Republic predecessors were assigned. =1990 ‚Äì present= Stra≈º Graniczna has been reestablished in the Third Polish Republic as a civil, police-type service, with the act of 12 October 1990 and began operations on 16 May 1991.

It provides MRT access to the ethnic district of Chinatown, after which it was named. The construction of the station was considered an engineering achievement, due to the busy traffic on the roads above and a number of nearby historical buildings that had to be preserved during the construction. It is within walking distances to Telok Ayer MRT station on the Downtown line. History Chinatown MRT station Concourse. Downtown line platform It was originally named People's Park during the construction. In 1999 the name was changed to Chinatown to reflect the heritage of the station. The North East line was opened on 20 June 2003. Before the North East line part of this station opened, the Singapore Civil Defence Force conducted the second ever Shelter Open House on 15‚Äì16 February 2003, together with Farrer Park, Serangoon and Hougang stations. This station is said to be the most challenging station to build on the North East line, due to the large number of buildings above ground, most with reinforced concrete or timber piles and all in marine clay.Construction of the North East Line Another feat was that they had to preserve Garden Bridge, a large overhead bridge on bore piles, while building the station below. The tidal Eu Tong Sen Canal was also diverted into four two-meter diameter steel pipes slung under the temporary traffic decks (two on each side). Part of the New Bridge Road was often closed between 12 January 1998 and 20 October 2001 for the construction of Chinatown MRT station. Traffic along Eu Tong Sen Street was diverted until January 2000. The Downtown Line was planned since the late 1990s from Tampines to Bukit Panjang and in order to duplicate the East West Line. The Contract 909 for the construction of Chinatown DTL station and associated tunnels were awarded to Gammon Construction at a contract sum of S$160.3 million. Works commenced on 12 February 2008. This DTL station was opened on 22 December 2013, for those travelling from Bugis to Chinatown, it is preferable to take a bus 2, 12 or 33 from Victoria Street and limited bus services from Eu Tong Sen Street (People's Park Centre). Since 21 October 2017, with the opening of DTL from Chinatown to Expo, Tampines and Bedok North residents also have enhanced connectivity to Chinatown area which is more convenient.

The station is located at the junction of Bukit Timah Road and Race Course Road, on the boundary of the planning areas of Kallang and Rochor, Singapore. The station serves the ethnic neighbourhood of Little India, and is within walking distances to key locations such as KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Tekka Market, and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) headquarters. Opening on 20 June 2003 as part of the NEL, it later became an interchange station with the DTL when Stage 2 of the line started operations on 27 December 2015. History =North East line= NEL platforms The station was first announced as \\"Kandang Kerbau\\" when the North East line stations were revealed on 6 March 1996. The announcement of the station was 'greatly welcomed' by the residents and shopkeepers in Little India, who hoped that the station will give the Little India district a 'new lease of life' with more developments around the station. Contract 706 for the design and construction of Kandang Kerbau station was awarded to a joint venture between Hyundai Engineering & Construction and Zublin AG at S$311.56 million (US$ million) in April 1997. The contract also includes the construction of the adjacent Farrer Park station. During the construction, on 7 October 1998, construction workers at the site unearthed human skeletons, alongside discoveries of gold, jewellery, coins and weapons such as machine guns and ammunition. Widely speculated to be massacred victims during the Japanese occupation, the exact origins of the remains remained unknown. To facilitate the construction, Buffalo Lane, which connects shoppers to the nearby Tekka Centre, was set to be closed. However, the Moulmein Tekka Residents' Committee was concerned that the closure of the road will create inconvenience and road congestion around the station site. Eventually, a metal decking on the road was constructed to allow the public to utilise the road to access Tekka Centre as construction works continued underneath the decking. Although a simple solution, the road decking was needed to be shifted around five times during the construction. As the deck took up a notable amount of space at the worksite, the construction schedule has to be reworked which cost the Land Transport Authority (LTA) about $1 million (US$ million). Another challenge faced was the construction of the underpass from the station to the opposite side of Bukit Timah Road underneath the Bukit Timah Canal. It was initially considered to use the conventional cut-and-cover method to construct the underpass but there were a few problems with the method. The method would involve disrupting the vehicular traffic on Bukit Timah Road, and obstructing the water flow of the canal, which could potentially lead to the flooding of the road, the station and the tunnels. An alternative method ‚Äì the open-face tunnelling method used by miners ‚Äì was then employed and was proven successful, without the need to disrupt the traffic on Bukit Timah Road. The station eventually opened for operations on 20 June 2003 as Little India station. The station name change was opposed by the Singapore Heritage Society, which claimed that the new name was 'misleading', suggesting that the area was the 'main abode of Indians'. They had advocated keeping the name \\"Kandang Kerbau\\", which means 'buffalo shed' in Malay, as it best reflects the area's heritage. =Downtown line= DTL Platforms The DTL station was first announced as part of DTL2 (Downtown line Stage 2) on 15 July 2008. Contract 921 for the design and construction of Little India station and tunnels was awarded to SsangYong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd at a contract value of $803.3 million (US$ million) in June 2009, linking the DTL with the NEL at this station. The contract also included the construction of the adjacent Rochor station. Construction of the station was scheduled to commence in the third quarter of 2009 and targeted to be completed by 2015. The construction of the DTL station involves navigating through the large boulders underground. A section of the DTL tunnel below the NEL tunnels have to be manually mined due to the hard ground and the huge boulders. A boulder the size of a double-decker bus was also broken into smaller pieces using specialised hydraulic machinery during the construction. The station opened on 27 December 2015 along with the other DTL Stage 2 stations. =Incidents= On 20 December 2012, train services on the North East line was delayed due to a train fault. A statement from SBS Transit said there was no train service between Punggol and Little India due to a train fault. Free bus rides were made available at designated bus stops near affected NEL stations. At about 5.18 pm, all train services resumed. SBS Transit has apologised for the inconvenience caused. On 24 April 2013, a woman known only as Madam Ong had her leg trapped in the gap between the station platform and the train, saying that she was pushed. She suffered minor injuries. No one was injured in a fire that broke out at a Downtown line worksite along Race Course Road on the evening of 26 March 2014. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) told Yahoo Singapore that a \\"small fire\\" had broken out at a \\"localised area\\" within the worksite of the Downtown line Little India MRT station. \\"There is also no impact to DTL2 construction progress,\\" added a spokesperson for the LTA, who added that the fire was put out by 10pm, after it first broke out about half an hour earlier. =Art in Transit= The artwork featured in the North East line section features Memoirs of the Past by S.

Biography Bolyai was born in Bolya, a village near Hermannstadt, Grand Principality of Transylvania (now Buia, Sibiu County, Romania). His father was G√°sp√°r Bolyai and his mother Krisztina Vajna. Farkas was taught at home by his father until the age of six when he was sent to the Calvinist school in Nagyszeben. His teachers recognized his talents in arithmetics and in learning languages. He learned Latin, Greek, Romanian, Hebrew and later also French, Italian and English. He easily multiplied, divided 13- or 14-digit numbers in his head, and was able to draw square and cubic roots from them. At the age of 12 he left school and was appointed as a tutor to the eight-year-old son of the count Kem√©ny. This meant that Bolyai was now treated as a member of one of the leading families in the country, and he became not only a tutor but a real friend to the count's son. In 1790 Bolyai and his pupil both entered the Calvinist College in Kolozsv√°r (today Cluj-Napoca) where they spent five years. The professor of philosophy at the College in Kolozsv√°r tried to turn Bolyai against mathematics and towards religious philosophy. Bolyai, however, decided to go abroad with Simon Kem√©ny on an educational trip in 1796 and began to study mathematics systematically at German universities first at Jena and then at G√∂ttingen. In these times Bolyai became a close friend of Carl Friedrich Gauss. He returned home to Kolozsv√°r in 1799. It was there he met and married Zsuzsanna Benk≈ë and where their son J√°nos Bolyai - later an even more famous mathematician than his father - was born in 1802. Soon thereafter he accepted a teaching position for mathematics and sciences at the Calvinist College in Marosv√°s√°rhely (today T√¢rgu-Mure≈ü), where he spent the rest of his life. Mathematical work Bolyai's main interests were the foundations of geometry and the parallel axiom. His main work, Tentamen juventutem studiosam in elementa matheseos purae, elementaris ac sublimioris, methodo intuitiva, evidentiaque huic propria, introducendi (An Attempt to Introduce Studious Youths to the Elements of Pure Mathematics; 1832),Online version was an attempt at a rigorous and systematic foundation of geometry, arithmetic, algebra and analysis. In this work, he gave iterative procedures to solve equations which he then proved convergent by showing them to be monotonically increasing and bounded above. His study of the convergence of series includes a test equivalent to Raabe's test, which he discovered independently and at about the same time as Raabe. Other important ideas in the work include a general definition of a function and a definition of an equality between two plane figures if they can both be divided into a finite equal number of pairwise congruent pieces. He first dissuaded his son from the study of non-Euclidean geometry, but by 1832 he became enthusiastic enough to persuade his son to publish his path-breaking thoughts. J√°nos's ideas were published an appendix to the Tentamen. Notes References * A. Todea, F. Maria, M.

Stockbarger (1895‚Äì1952). The method includes two similar but distinct techniques primarily used for growing boules (single crystal ingots), but which can be used for solidifying polycrystalline ingots as well. The methods involve heating polycrystalline material above its melting point and slowly cooling it from one end of its container, where a seed crystal is located. A single crystal of the same crystallographic orientation as the seed material is grown on the seed and is progressively formed along the length of the container. The process can be carried out in a horizontal or vertical orientation, and usually involves a rotating crucible/ampoule to stir the melt. The Bridgman method is a popular way of producing certain semiconductor crystals such as gallium arsenide, for which the Czochralski method is more difficult. The process can reliably produce single crystal ingots, but does not necessarily result in uniform properties through the crystal. Bridgman- Stockbarger method The difference between the Bridgman technique and Stockbarger technique is subtle: While both methods utilize a temperature gradient and a moving crucible, the Bridgman technique utilizes the relatively uncontrolled gradient produced at the exit of the furnace; the Stockbarger technique introduces a baffle, or shelf, separating two coupled furnaces with temperatures above and below the freezing point. Stockbarger's modification of the Bridgman technique allows for better control over the temperature gradient at the melt/crystal interface. When seed crystals are not employed as described above, polycrystalline ingots can be produced from a feedstock consisting of rods, chunks, or any irregularly shaped pieces once they are melted and allowed to re-solidify. The resultant microstructure of the ingots so obtained are characteristic of directionally solidified metals and alloys with their aligned grains. A variant of the technique known as the horizontal directional solidification method (HDSM) developed by Khachik Bagdasarov starting in the 1960s in the Soviet Union uses a flat-bottomed crucible with short sidewalls rather than an enclosed ampoule, and has been used to grow various large oxide crystals including Yb:YAG (a laser host crystal), and sapphire crystals 45 cm wide and over 1 meter long.

(also known as Malibu Graphics) was an American comic book publisher active in the late 1980s and early 1990s, best known for its Ultraverse line of superhero titles. Notable titles under the Malibu label included The Men in Black, Ultraforce, Night Man and Exiles. The company's headquarters was in Calabasas, California. Malibu was initially publisher of record for Image Comics from 1992 to 1993. The company's other imprints included Aircel Comics and Eternity Comics. Malibu also owned a small software development company that designed video games in the early to mid-1990s called Malibu Interactive. History = Origins = Malibu Comics was launched in 1986 by Dave Olbrich and Tom Mason (joined by Chris Ulm in 1987) thanks to the financing of Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, who was operating a comic book distribution company (Sunrise Distributors) at the time. Olbrich had previously been managing editor of the trade publication Amazing Heroes, as well as the administrator of The Jack Kirby Awards. Malibu began modestly with creator-owned black-and-white titles, but made a name for itself publishing a combination of new series and licensed properties such as the classic characters Tarzan and Sherlock Holmes, and popular TV, movie and video game tie-ins. Malibu's first title was Ex-Mutants. = Publishers acquisitions and Genesis = Malibu's 1987 financing arrangement with Rosenberg also led to it effectively acquiring Eternity Comics and Canadian publisher Aircel Comics as imprints. In 1989, Malibu acquired the publisher Adventure Publications.\\"Malibu Acquires Adventure,\\" The Comics Journal #127 (February 1989), p. 21. From that point forward, the Malibu brand was used for superhero titles, while the Eternity brand was used for the magazine line, and also for anime-inspired titles like Robotech. The Adventure Publications brand was used for Malibu's licensed titles, such as Planet of the Apes and Doc Savage; while the Aircel brand was used for Barry Blair's comics and Malibu's adult line. In 1992, heroes from Centaur Publications (a Golden Age publisher whose properties fell into the public domain) were revived in the form of the Protectors (Airman, Amazing-Man, Aura, Arc, Arrow, Ferret, Man of War and Mighty Man, among others). Several of these characters had short-lived spin- off titles of their own. The Centaur heroes and other characters from Adventure (Miss Fury and Rocket Ranger), Aircel (Cat & Mouse and Men In Black) and Eternity (Dinosaurs For Hire, Ex-Mutants and Shuriken) plus Dead Clown and Widowmaker were put together in one Universe to form the Genesis line. The Bravura imprint was then launched for the creator-owned and licensed titles. The company also served as publishers of record for the first comics from Image Comics in 1992, giving the upstart creator-run publisher access to the distribution channels.\\"Bye Bye Marvel; Here Comes Image: Portacio, Claremont, Liefeld, Jim Lee Join McFarlane's New Imprint at Malibu,\\" The Comics Journal #148 (February 1992), pp. 11-12.

However, by the beginning of 1993, Image's financial situation was secure enough to publish its titles independently, and it left Malibu.\\"Image Leaves Malibu, Becomes Own Publisher,\\" The Comics Journal #155 (January 1993), p. 22. = Malibu Interactive and Ultraverse = In late 1992, seeking to capitalize on the growing video game market, Malibu merged with video game developer Acme Interactive to form Malibu Interactive.\\"Newswatch: Malibu to Produce Video Games: Comic publisher merges with video game developer Acme Interactive,\\" The Comics Journal #153 (October 1992), p. 19. The Ultraverse line was launched in June 1993 during the \\"boom\\" of the early 1990s, roughly concurrent with the debut of publishers such as Image and Valiant, and new superhero lines from DC and Dark Horse (Milestone and Comics' Greatest World, respectively). The line was in part intended to fill the gap left by Image's independence. They boasted improved production values over traditional comics (especially digital coloring and higher-quality paper), and a roster of respected and/or talented new writers and artists. Emphasizing the tight continuity between the various series in the Ultraverse line, Malibu made extensive use of crossovers, in which a story that began in one series would be continued in the next-shipping issue of another series. Various promotions for special editions or limited- print stories followed. The Ultraverse line came to dominate Malibu's catalog. Malibu launched additionally the Rock-It Comix imprint for rock band comics in early 1994. Malibu worked with Gold Mountain Entertainment management firm in dealing with the musicians, while International Strategic Marketing was distributing the line to comic book shops, music outlets and newsstands. = Acquisition by Marvel Comics = As sales declined industry-wide in the mid-1990s, Malibu canceled lower-selling series. Nonetheless, the company's assets were still seen as attractive enough to garner interest from DC Comics in the spring of 1994.Tom Mason, quoted in MacDonald, Heidi. \\"Quote of the day: get in the time machine,\\" The Beat (Nov. 16, 2013): \\"Marvel bought Malibu for only one reason: to keep it away from DC which had been negotiating to buy the company since April/May 1994.\\" In addition, Rosenberg and Malibu signed with the William Morris Agency.\\"Malibu Signs with William Morris Agency,\\" The Comics Journal #170 (August 1994), p. 40.

In the middle of the next year, Malibu standard-bearers Mason and Ulm left the company.\\"Mason, Ulm Leave Malibu,\\" The Comics Journal #179 (August 1995), p. 24. Marvel canceled the entire Ultraverse line, but (during the Black September event) re-launched a handful of the more popular titles as well as a number of crossovers with Marvel characters. The \\"volume 2\\" series each started with \\"#‚àû (infinity)\\" issues and were canceled a short time later. Very little Malibu content was published after 1996. Within the Marvel Comics multiverse, the Genesis Universe is designated as Earth-1136 and the Ultraverse as Earth-93060.  Potential Ultraverse revival  In June 2005, when asked by Newsarama whether Marvel had any plans to revive the Ultraverse, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada replied that: In May 2012, Steve Englehart suggested in a podcast interview that the reason Marvel will not presently publish the Ultraverse characters is because five percent of the profits from those books would have to go to the Malibu creators that are still alive.Johnston, Rich. \\"Steve Englehart ‚Äì How 5% Doomed The Ultraverse,\\" Bleeding Cool (May 22, 2012).

It was released in October 1989 and peaked at no. 2 on the UK Albums Chart. It has been certified Platinum by the BPI for sales of 300,000 in the UK, and Gold by the RIAA in the US. Overview Bush drew inspiration for the title track from the novel Ulysses by James Joyce. Bush realised that Molly Bloom's soliloquy, the closing passage of the novel, fit the music she had created. When the Joyce estate refused to release the text, Bush wrote original lyrics that echo the original passage, as Molly steps from the pages of the book and revels in the real world. She also alluded to \\"Jerusalem\\" by William Blake in a reference to the song's gestation (\\"And my arrows of desire rewrite the speech\\"). The song includes Irish instrumentation (uilleann pipes, fiddle, whistle) under a breathy rendering of the orgasmic 'Yes' of the original text. The songs \\"Deeper Understanding\\", \\"Never Be Mine\\", and \\"Rocket's Tail\\" all feature backing vocals by the Bulgarian vocal ensemble Trio Bulgarka. \\"Heads We're Dancing\\" includes a characteristic Mick Karn fretless bassline. The song \\"This Woman's Work\\" from the movie She's Having a Baby (1988) was re-edited for this album. On 27 November 2005 it was featured in the British TV drama Walk Away and I Stumble starring Tamzin Outhwaite. Due to that broadcast, the song reached number 3 on the UK Download Chart in late 2005. This song has also been used in a long-running UK television advert for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, broadcast between 2005 and 2008, and in the Extras Christmas Special in 2007. A version of the song was recorded by R&B; artist Maxwell in 1997 for his MTV Unplugged EP. Released as CD players were becoming increasingly popular, the original LP ended with \\"This Woman's Work\\", whilst \\"Walk Straight Down the Middle\\" was included as a bonus track on the CD and cassette versions of the album. The gap between these two tracks is slightly longer to indicate the album was intended to finish with \\"This Woman's Work\\". A video collection called The Sensual World: The Videos was also released. It contained videos for the title song, \\"Love and Anger\\", and \\"This Woman's Work\\" (all directed by Bush herself), as well as excerpts from an interview Bush gave to the music TV channel VH1. In 1991, The Sensual World was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. Bush was also nominated for two BRIT Awards in 1990 as Best British Producer and Best British Album of the Year. In May 2011, Bush released the album Director's Cut, which featured new versions of four songs from The Sensual World, including the title song, now called \\"Flower of the Mountain\\". Finally having received permission from the Joyce estate, Bush recorded a new vocal using Molly Bloom's soliloquy as the lyric. Additionally, she re-recorded a sparse, piano-only version of \\"This Woman's Work\\". The new version of \\"Deeper Understanding\\" was released as a single, with an accompanying video. The live version of \\"Never Be Mine\\" was included on her live album Before the Dawn, released in 2016. The song was never performed in front of the audience, however, Bush decided to include the live version into the recording. Critical reception \\"While Bush's famously fey voice would probably be enough to hold the disparate strands of The Sensual World together, the album takes its cue and colouring too from the hypnotically sinuous sway of the pipes on the title track,\\" wrote Robert Sandall in Q. \\"There are some strapping power chords to be despatched here and there, most notably on Love And Anger, but the dominant mood is of Oriental reverie, similar in feel to that achieved latterly by Japan. And the last track on A side, Heads We're Dancing, reproduces that mysteriously sproingy bass sound favoured by Mick Karn.\\" Slant Magazine listed the album at number 55 on its list of the \\"Best Albums of the 1980s\\", writing, \\"Blessed with one of music's most wildly expressive voices, Bush takes each song further than she has to, resulting in an album that forms its own unique world.\\" Track listing Personnel *Kate Bush ‚Äì piano, keyboards, vocals *Del Palmer ‚Äì Fairlight CMI percussion, bass guitar (1, 4, 7), rhythm guitar and percussion (5) *Charlie Morgan ‚Äì drums (1, 4, 6, 11) *Stuart Elliott ‚Äì drums (2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) *Bill Whelan ‚Äì arranger (\\"The Irish sessions\\") *Paddy Bush ‚Äì whip (swished fishing rod) (1), valiha and backing vocals (2), mandolin (4), tupan (6) *Davy Spillane ‚Äì uilleann pipes (1, 8), whistle (3) *John Sheahan ‚Äì fiddle (1) *D√≥nal Lunny ‚Äì bouzouki (1) *John Giblin ‚Äì bass guitar (2, 6, 9) *David Gilmour ‚Äì guitar (2, 9) *Alan Murphy ‚Äì guitar, guitar synth (3, 5, 7) *Jonathan Williams ‚Äì cello (3, 5, 7) *Nigel Kennedy ‚Äì violin (3), viola (5) *Michael Kamen ‚Äì orchestral arrangements (3, 5, 10) *Alan Stivell ‚Äì Celtic harp (3, 7), backing vocals (7) *\\"Dr. Bush\\" (Robert Bush, Kate's father) ‚Äì dialogue (3) *Balanescu Quartet ‚Äì strings (4) *Michael Nyman ‚Äì string arrangement (Balanescu Quartet) *Mick Karn ‚Äì bass guitar (5) *Trio Bulgarka ‚Äì vocals (6, 8, 9) *Yanka Rupkina (of Trio Bulgarka) ‚Äì solo vocalist (6, 9) *Dimitar Penev ‚Äì arranger (Trio Bulgarka) *Eberhard Weber ‚Äì double bass (8, 11) Production *Kate Bush ‚Äì producer *Del Palmer ‚Äì recording engineer, mixing (11) *Haydn Bendall, Kevin Killen, Paul Gomazel ‚Äì additional recording engineers *Tom Leader ‚Äì assistant engineer (Trio Bulgarka sessions) *Andrew Boland ‚Äì engineer (\\"The Irish sessions\\") *John Grimes ‚Äì assistant engineer (\\"The Irish sessions\\") *Kevin Killen ‚Äì mixing (1‚Äì10) *Ian Cooper ‚Äì mastering Charts and certifications =Weekly charts= { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Chart (1989‚Äì1990) !Position - !scope=\\"row\\"Australian ARIA Albums Chart 30 - !scope=\\"row\\"Canadian RPM Albums Chart 14 - !scope=\\"row\\"Dutch Mega Albums Chart 16 - !scope=\\"row\\"French SNEP Albums Chart 38 - !scope=\\"row\\"German Media Control Albums Chart 10 - !scope=\\"row\\"Italian Albums Chart 14 - !scope=\\"row\\"Japanese Oricon Albums Chart 18 - !scope=\\"row\\"New Zealand Albums Chart 27 - !scope=\\"row\\"Norwegian VG-lista Albums Chart 7 - !scope=\\"row\\"Swedish Albums Chart 17 - !scope=\\"row\\"Swiss Albums Chart 11 - !scope=\\"row\\"UK Albums Chart 2 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Billboard 200 43 } =Year-end charts= { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !Chart (1989) !Position - !scope=\\"row\\"Canadian Albums Chart 93 - !scope=\\"row\\"Italian Albums Chart 66 - !scope=\\"row\\"UK Albums Chart 45 } =Certifications and sales= The Sensual World ‚Äì The Videos =Track listing= # \\"Interview\\" ‚Äì 0:36 # \\"The Sensual World\\" ‚Äì 5:15 # \\"Love and Anger\\" ‚Äì 4:43 # \\"This Woman's Work\\" ‚Äì 6:31 See also *Kate Bush discography *List of awards and nominations received by Kate Bush References Category:Kate Bush albums Category:1989 albums Category:EMI Records albums Category:Progressive pop albums Category:Art rock albums by English artists ","title":"The Sensual World"},{"id":"1159176","text":"GSV may refer to: * Garrison of S√∏r-Varanger, a military base of the Norwegian Army * General Systems Vehicle, a class of giant spaceship in The Culture, a fictional society described in novels by late Scottish author Iain Banks * Geological Survey of Victoria, now GeoScience Victoria * Gilbert‚ÄìShannon‚ÄìVarshamov bound * Girls Sport Victoria, an Australian high school sporting association * Google Street View *Gonad specific virus, a sexually transmitted virus specific to the corn earworm moth * Great saphenous vein ","title":"GSV"},{"id":"1159183","text":"USS Hardhead (SS-365), a submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the hardhead, a fish of the croaker family. Hardhead received six battle stars for World War II service. All six of her combat patrols were \\"successful\\". Hardhead was launched by Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co., Manitowoc, Wisconsin, 12 December 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Inez Riddle McDonald, wife of Lt. Commander Eugene F. McDonald (Retired), President of Zenith Radio Corp.; and commissioned 18 April 1944, Commander Fitzhugh McMaster in command. Service history Following shakedown training in Lake Michigan the submarine entered a floating dry dock at Lockport, Illinois, and was towed to New Orleans, where she arrived 16 May 1944. Hardhead got underway from Algiers, Louisiana, 22 May, and arrived Balboa, Canal Zone, 5 days later. There she took part in additional training exercises before her arrival at Pearl Harbor 7 July 1944. =First war patrol, July ‚Äì September 1944= Hardhead, departed on her first war patrol 27 July and proceeded to her patrol area off the Philippines. Early 18 August she detected the east of San Bernardino Strait, and closed for a surface attack. The first well-directed salvo stopped the cruiser dead in the water; a second sent her to the bottom. During the remainder of her first patrol Hardhead rendered lifeguard services during strikes by fleet aircraft on the Philippines and operated with a reconnaissance line during the Palaus operation. She arrived Fremantle, Australia, 26 September 1944. =Second war patrol, October ‚Äì December 1944= Hardheads second patrol began as she departed Fremantle 24 October and set course for the Philippines. While steaming on the surface through the Sulu Sea October she discovered a life raft adrift. In it was Commander Bakutis, commander of a fighter squadron (VF-20) from the aircraft carrier , who had been in the water for six days after being shot down during America's victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Operating in a coordinated group with and , the submarine sighted a large cargo ship with escorts 8 November. After being driven off in one attack, Hardhead aggressively gained an ahead position and sank Manei Maru. It was during this attack that Growler was lost. Hardhead performed lifeguard duty off Subic Bay in November and on 25 November came upon an escorted merchant ship. She sank a coast defense vessel, damaged the merchantman, and evaded a retaliatory depth charge attack. Soon afterward, the submarine returned to Fremantle, ending another patrol on 5 December. =Third and fourth war patrols, December 1944 ‚Äì May 1945= Putting to sea again 24 December, Hardhead began her third war patrol in the South China Sea. Operating with and , Hardhead damaged several ships before sinking Nanshin Maru 2 February 1945. Following lifeguard duty for the B-29 strikes on Singapore she returned to Fremantle 15 February. Hardheads fourth war patrol included a special mine-laying mission. She sailed 20 March 1945 and laid mines off French Indochina during the night of 2 April. The submarine then entered the Gulf of Siam, where after several attacks she sank cargo ship Araosan Maru 6 April. Following a visit to Subic Bay to reload 11 April ‚Äì 15 April she patrolled the South China Sea, but found few contacts. American submarines had by this time reduced Japanese merchant activity to a trickle, effectively destroying the island nation's lifeline to the outside world. Hardhead returned to Fremantle 16 May. =Fifth and sixth war patrols, June ‚Äì August 1945= Sailing from Fremantle 18 June, Hardhead began her fifth war patrol, to be conducted in the Java Sea. She severely damaged a freighter with her deck guns 22 June, and next day sank four coastal defense craft during an attack on Ambat Roads with including submarine chasers Cha-42 () and Cha-113 (ex-Dutch minesweeper A) () and shuttle boat No. 8333 southeast of the Masalembu Islands. The illness of her commanding officer forced Hardhead to end her fifth patrol 17 July at Onslow, Australia. The submarine departed Onslow on her sixth and last patrol 18 July, and headed back into the Java Sea. On 23 July 1943, she torpedoed and sank the submarine chaser Cha-117 (ex- Dutch Bantam) off the northeast coast of Bali (). She forced a merchant ship to beach 27 July but found few targets and returned to Subic Bay 10 August. Soon afterward the Pacific war ended. Hardhead sailed 31 August and arrived at San Francisco via Pearl Harbor 22 September 1945. She decommissioned 10 May 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Mare Island. =Post-war service, 1952‚Äì1972= Hardhead was placed in commission in reserve 6 February 1952 and upon her arrival at New London for conversion was placed out of commission. Following her GUPPY IIA conversion, including streamlining, installation of a snorkel breathing apparatus, and larger storage batteries, the submarine recommissioned 24 March 1953. She joined the Atlantic Fleet for training exercises and tactical drills in the years that followed, operating mainly in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States. She sailed for the Mediterranean 7 September 1956 to strengthen the 6th Fleet during the Suez Crisis. In July 1958 Hardhead, joined Submarine Development Group 2, turning her attention from fleet operations to research and testing of equipment and tactical doctrine. She operated off the East Coast and in the north Atlantic, and by 1961 had won four consecutive \\"E\\" awards for her performance. Hardhead continued through 1972 to perform this vital work in maintaining the technical superiority and readiness of the fleet. In 1962, Hardhead participated in the Cuban Missile Crisis. =Greek service= Hardhead was decommissioned, struck from the Naval Register, and transferred (sold) under the terms of the Security Assistance Program to Greece. On 26 July 1972 raised the Greek flag at New London (Connecticut) and sailed to Greece on 29 December 1972. She was commissioned into the Hellenic Navy as Papanikolis (S-114). She was struck from the Greek Naval rolls on 4 May 1993.

Used to replicate material, the use of seed crystal to promote growth avoids the otherwise slow randomness of natural crystal growth and allows manufacture on a scale suitable for industry. Process The large crystal can be grown by dipping the seed into a supersaturated solution, into molten material that is then cooled, or by growth on the seed face by passing vapor of the material to be grown over it. Theory The theory behind this effect is thought to derive from the physical intermolecular interaction that occurs between compounds in a supersaturated solution (or possibly vapor). In solution, liberated (soluble) molecules (solute) are free to move about in random flow. This random flow permits for the possibility of two or more molecular compounds to interact. This interaction can potentiate intermolecular forces between the separate molecules and form a basis for a crystal lattice. The placement of a seed crystal into solution allows the recrystallization process to expedite by eliminating the need for random molecular collision or interaction. By introducing an already pre-formed basis of the target crystal to act upon, the intermolecular interactions are formed much more easily or readily, than relying on random flow. Often, this phase transition from solute in a solution to a crystal lattice will be referred to as nucleation. Seeding is therefore said to decrease the necessary amount of time needed for nucleation to occur in a recrystallization process. Uses One example where a seed crystal is used to grow large boules or ingots of a single crystal is the semiconductor industry where methods such as the Czochralski process or Bridgman technique are employed. Another use of seed crystals is the fact that they are the coagulant in a water-purifier packet (these packets help purify dirty water) Also during the process of tempering chocolate, seed crystals can be used to promote the growth of favorable type V crystalshttps://chocolatealchemy.com/cocoa-butter-silk See also * Crystal structure * Crystallization * Laser heated pedestal growth * Micro-pulling- down * Single crystal * Wafer (electronics) References Category:Crystals ","title":"Seed crystal"},{"id":"1159193","text":"Gants Hill is a London Underground station in the largely residential Gants Hill district of Ilford in East London. It is served by the Central line and is between Redbridge and Newbury Park stations on the Hainault loop. It is in Travelcard Zone 4. It is the easternmost station to be below ground on the London Underground network and the busiest on the Hainault loop. The station ticket hall is located beneath Gants Hill roundabout and reached via pedestrian subways. It opened on 14 December 1947 as an extension of the Central line to form the new part of the Hainault loop. The station is known for its distinctive architecture featuring barrel-vaulted halls at platform level designed by Charles Holden. Location The station has taken its name from the Gants Hill roundabout, where the name Gants Hill could have originated from the le Gant family who were notable as stewards. The ticket hall is directly underneath the roundabout, located in the heart of Gants Hill district. The roundabout connects to Woodford Avenue, Eastern Avenue and Cranbrook Road. The station serves a mainly residential area, and is near Valentines Park, Valentines High School, and \\"Faces\\" Nightclub. History As part of the 1935‚Äì40 New Works Programme, the Central line was to be extended from Liverpool Street to south of Leyton where it would connect to and take over passenger operations on the London & North Eastern Railway's (LNER's) suburban branch to Epping and Ongar in Essex. The section of the LNER's Fairlop Loop (now known as Hainault Loop) between Woodford and Newbury Park was also to be transferred, though not the section south from Newbury Park to Ilford and Seven Kings on the Great Eastern Main Line. To replace the truncated route south from Newbury Park, a new underground section between Leytonstone and Newbury Park was constructed, running mostly under Eastern Avenue. Three new stations, which include Gants Hill were built to serve the new suburbs of north Ilford and the Fairlop Loop. During planning, the names \\"Ilford North\\" and \\"Cranbrook\\" were considered for this station. Construction began before 1937 and most of the tunnelled section was completed by 1940 but delayed due to the outbreak of the Second World War and eventually came to a halt in June 1940. During the war, the station was used as an air raid shelter and the unused tunnels between the station and Redbridge were used as a munitions factory for Plessey electronics. Construction restarted after the war ended, with the line extended to Stratford on 4 December 1946, and then to Leytonstone on 5 May 1947. Gants Hill station opened on 14 December 1947 as part of an extension to Newbury Park. Design The lower concourse, with its design inspired by stations on the Moscow Metro The station, like the other two new stations on the branch, was designed by architect Charles Holden in the 1930s. During the 1930s the London Passenger Transport Board had provided advice on the construction of the Moscow Metro and an internal report in 1935 by the Underground's engineers on the Russian capital's system led to the decision to construct a station in London to a similar design. The station ticket hall is located beneath the roundabout at the centre of the road junction. It is accessed via a series of pedestrian subways and has no street level buildings, although low structures on the roundabout sit above the ticket hall and provide daylight and ventilation. From the ticket hall, three escalators lead to the barrel-vaulted lower concourse between the two platforms tunnels. The station also features miniature roundels on the tiles at platform level as well as the \\"roundel clocks\\". Gants Hill is the only Underground station with a concourse designed by Holden that has no surface buildings. Unlike Redbridge, the station is not Grade II listed although its distinctive architectural qualities have gained public support for listing the station. Services and connections =Services= Gants Hill is served by the Central line between Redbridge and Newbury Park stations. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3‚Äì4 minutes between 05:23 and 23:57 westbound and 06:25 and 01:03 eastbound. Trains generally run between Hainault and Ealing Broadway via Newbury Park. The typical off-peak service, in trains per hour as of 2018 is: * 9tph eastbound to Hainault via Newbury Park * 3tph eastbound to Newbury Park * 9tph westbound to Ealing Broadway * 3tph westbound to White City The typical Night tube service, in trains per hour as of 2018 is: * 3tph eastbound to Hainault via Newbury Park * 3tph westbound to White City =Connections= A number of London Buses routes serve the station.

In the biblical account, the breastplate is sometimes termed the breastplate of judgment, because the Urim and Thummim were placed within it. These stones were, at times, used to determine God's will in a particular situation (see Exodus 28:30). Using these stones did not always determine God's will (see )Jewish Encyclopedia  Hebrew Bible  Illustration of priestly breastplate According to the description in Exodus, this breastplate was attached to the tunic-like garment known as an ephod by gold chains/cords tied to the gold rings on the ephod's shoulder straps, and by blue ribbon tied to the gold rings at the belt of the ephod. The biblical description states that the breastplate was also to be made from the same material as the Ephod‚Äîembroidery of 3 colors of dyed wool and linen‚Äîand was to be of a cubit squared, two layers thick, and with four rows of three engraved gems embedded in gold settings upon it, one setting for each stone. The description states that the square breastplate was to be formed from one rectangular piece of cloth‚Äî of a cubit by of a cubit, folded so that it formed a pouch to contain the Urim and Thummim. The Hebrew term for the breastplate, (·∏•≈ç≈°en), appears to be named from its appearance, probably derived from the same source as Arabic (·∏•assan), meaning \\"beautiful\\". The 19th-century German biblical scholar August Dillmann thought that it was more likely to be derived from the Hebrew word (·∏•≈ç·π£en), meaning \\"fold\\", relating to its function.: \\"Di. rejects the probable derivation from the root ·∏•asuna, 'to be beautiful', and would prefer to connect it with , sinus or 'fold' in which something is carried; cp.

The twelve jewels in the breastplate were each, according to the Biblical description, to be made from specific minerals, none of them the same as another, and each of them representative of a specific tribe, whose name was to be inscribed on the stone. According to a rabbinic tradition, the names of the twelve tribes were engraved upon the stones with what is called in Hebrew: ◊©◊û◊ô◊® = shamir, which, according to Rashi, was a small, rare creature which could cut through the toughest surfaces,Sifrey ·π≠rey  ªa·π°ar mefurashim, ed.

Rashi on Zechariah 7:12 (Hebrew), p. 174b but according to Rabbi David Kimhi and Rabbi Jonah ibn Janah, was a stone stronger than iron (possibly Naxian stone).David Kimhi, Sefer HaShorashim (Michlol, part ii), Venice 1547 (Hebrew), on Zechariah 7:12 p. 426-427Yonah ibn «¶anƒÅ·∏•, Sefer Shorashim (Book of Roots), ed. Dr. A. Berliner, Berlin 1896, s.v. ◊©◊û◊® (Hebrew), who explains the word by its Judeo-Arabic name, ◊û◊ê◊°, meaning, \\"diamond\\". The word has its equivalent in the Greek, œÉŒºŒÆœÅŒπœÇ (smeris).Babylonian Talmud, Gittin 68a; cf. Pliny the Elder, Natural History 36:54 (36:51). There are different views in classical rabbinical literature as to the order of the names; the Jerusalem Targum, for example, argued that the names appeared in the order according to which they were born. Maimonides describes the jewel stones arranged in four rows, saying that on the first stone belonging to Reuben were also engraved the names of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, while on the last stone belonging to Benjamin were also engraved the words \\"the tribes of God\\";Mishne Torah (Code of Jewish Law), Hil. Kelei Ha-Mikdash, 9:7. kabbalistic writers such as Hezekiah ben Manoah and Bahya ben Asher argued that only six letters from each name were present on each stone, together with a few letters from the names of Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob, or from the phrase \\"[these are] the tribes of Jeshurun\\", so that there were 72 letters in total (72 being a very significant number in Kabbalistic thought). There was also a different order for the names inscribed on the two \\"onyx\\" stones, carried on the High Priest's shoulders. One opinion suggests that the names of the twelve tribes were arranged in groups after their mothers: Leah's six sons aligned one after the other on one stone, with Judah heading this list, followed by Rachel's sons with the names of the concubines' sons interposed between the two sons of Rachel.Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 36a‚Äìb. Unfortunately, the meanings of the Hebrew names for the minerals, given by the masoretic text, are not clear, and though the Greek names for them in the Septuagint are more clear, some scholars believe that they cannot be completely relied on for this matter because the breastplate had gone out of use by the time the Septuagint was created, and several Greek names for various gems have changed meaning between the classical era and modern times. However, although classical rabbinical literature argues that the names were inscribed using a Shamir worm because neither chisels nor paint nor ink were allowed to mark them out,Babylonian Talmud, Gittin 68aBabylonian Talmud, Sotah 48b a more naturalistic approach suggests that the jewels must have had comparatively low hardness in order to be engraved upon, and therefore this gives an additional clue to the identity of the minerals. Others suggest that they were engraved with emery, having the similar property of a diamond used in cutting other stones and which was called in Greek œÉŒºŒÆœÅŒπœÇ (smeris). Explanation of the symbolic meaning of the jewels generated a great deal of both Jewish and Christian writing, and was a staple component of the tradition of lapidaries or books on gemology. The jewel stones are as follows (the first item in each row is probably the right hand side, as Hebrew is a right to left script): = First row = *Odem (, in the masoretic text) / Sardios (in the Septuagint) ‚Äì both names mean red (Odem is cognate with Adam), and probably refers to sard, a very common stone in classical cultures. All authors agree that this stone was of a red colour.cf. Bar-Bahalul, 1886, vol. ii, p. 1313 With due respect to the Septuagint, Odem might also refer to carnelian, which was flesh-coloured, or to jasper, which was usually a deep blood-red, was valued as a charm against bleeding, and was common in the surrounding nations of Egypt, Babylonia, and Assyria. The Chinese Union Version refers to this stone as being a ruby. *Pit'dah (◊§÷¥÷º◊ò÷∞◊ì÷∏◊î in the masoretic text) / Topazios (in the Septuagint) ‚Äì despite the suggestion of the Septuagint that it was topaz, topaz was scarcely known at the time the Book of Exodus was written (according to both the traditional dating of the book and that by critical scholars); in the classical era, topazios referred to Topazos Island, on which a particular yellow mineral was mined (topazios means to seek, in reference to the difficulty in finding the island). Others suggest that topaz was merely peridot, a light green semi-precious stone, and which stone in the ancient world was found primarily on Topazos Island as well as on St. John's Island (Zabargad) in the Egyptian Red Sea. The word pit'dah is thought by scholars to be connected with the Assyrian word hipindu, which refers to something that flashed (presumably meaning shimmered), and thus the jewel in question would fit the description of chrysolite, a translucent greenish yellow mineral, common throughout the Levant, and particularly found on a particular Zabargad in the Red Sea, under the control of the Egyptian Pharaoh. *Bare·∏≥et (◊ë÷∏◊®÷∂◊ß÷∂◊™ = in the masoretic text) / Smaragdos (in the Septuagint) ‚Äì Bareketh etymologically means 'lightning flash', whence shimmering or shiny. Smaragdos is cognate with emerald, but is somewhat of a false friend as the Greek term could apply to a number of different green gems, not just the emerald in particular. Smaragdos was often used in Greek literature to refer to an intensely bright crystal found in columnar formations. Emerald in the stricter modern sense of green beryl exists locally in Egypt. Items carved from emerald are known from as early as the 12th Dynasty, 1900s BCE, during the Bronze Age. But these emeralds are random finds, and not actively mined until the Ptolemaic period. Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, is famous for her love for the Egyptian emerald. Other minerals resembling emerald are heliodor (taking into account the implication of Smaragdos that it was green) and rock crystal (ignoring the literal meaning of Smaragdos, since the masoretic text does not appear to specify colour); there is much to be said for Smaragdos being either of those. Although \\"emerald\\" is the most common form used to describe the Hebrew word, bare·∏≥et, in other sources (e.g. the Septuagint on Ezekiel 28:13), the word bare·∏≥et is rendered as \\"onyx\\". Aquilas the proselyte (Onkelos), in his Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch, writes ◊ë÷∏◊®◊ß÷∏◊ü = bar·∏≥an, for this word. According to the Midrash Rabba (Numbers Rabba 2:7), the stone called bare·∏≥et had veins or parallel bands of colours white, black and red running through it, suggesting that it may have actually been a kind of agate or onyx. This may explain why in some French translations the word is rendered as \\"agate\\". In the South Arabian dialect spoken in Yemen during the Middle Ages, ba·∏≥arani (believed to be a corruption of bar·∏≥an) was an exceptionally beautiful and rare onyx stone mined on Mount Anis, in Yemen, one variety of which having a red surface with a vein of white over another of black running through it. Symmachus, an ancient Jewish translator whose Greek translation of the Pentateuch appeared in Origen's Hexapla, has also written Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±œçŒΩŒπŒøœÇ, literally meaning ‚Äòof a thunderbolt‚Äô, and a more direct translation of the stone known in Hebrew as bare·∏≥et relating to bara·∏≥ ‚Äòlightning‚Äô in Exodus 28:17. Jerome, however, understood the Greek word to mean \\"onyx\\". = Second row = *Nofekh (◊†÷π◊§÷∂◊ö÷∞ = in the masoretic text) / Anthrax (in the Septuagint) ‚Äì while Anthrax simply means coal (presumably here referring to the colour of burning coal), the Vulgate here has Carbunculus, referring to the carbuncle, which was red. Philo of Alexandria, when writing about this stone, says that it was red. He seems to be in agreement with Josephus,Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, iii. vii ¬ß 5 the LXX, and the Jerusalem Targum, the latter saying that it is ◊õ◊ì◊õ◊ì◊†◊ê, explained by Saadia Gaon as meaning karkand, a red variety of precious stone. Nofekh appears to be a loan word; it may derive from the Egyptian term m-f-k-t, referring to malachite or turquoise, both of which are a greenish blue; it may instead derive from lupakku, a term appearing in the Amarna letters, referring to a mineral of unknown colour which was sent in tribute to Akhnaten from Ashkalon. In classical rabbinical literature there is some debate between whether Nofekh was red or greenish blue; Exodus Rabbah and the second Jerusalem Targum favour it being red, while the Babylonian Targum and first Jerusalem Targum favour it being green. *Sapir (◊°÷∑◊§÷¥÷º◊ô◊® = in the masoretic text) / Sapphiros (in the Septuagint) ‚Äì despite appearing to refer to sapphire, sapphire was essentially unknown before the era of the Roman Empire and its use in Greek texts is believed to be a mere transliteration of the Hebrew. Once it became more known, it was treated as merely being a form of hyacinth or of jacinth. It is more likely that the term Sapir referred to a mineral of similar colour to sapphires, and that the name gradually came to refer to the latter mineral, on account of its colour; scholars think the most likely candidate is lapis lazuli, a stone with a deep, ocean-blue colour which was frequently sent as a gift to Akhenaten from Babylon. Theophrastus mentions the stone sapphirus as being \\"dark\\" and having the \\"colour of verdigris\\", as well as being \\"speckled as of with gold\\". By all accounts, his description fits the lapis-lazuli. *Yahalom (◊ô÷∏◊î÷≤◊ú÷π◊ù = in the masoretic text) / Iaspis ·º¥Œ±œÉœÄŒπœÇ (in the Septuagint) ‚Äì in some other places the Septuagint instead has Beryllios where the masoretic reads Yahalom. The word Yahalom appears to be connected with the Hebrew meaning strike hard, and possibly with the word hallamish meaning flint; hallamish is connected to the Assyrian word elmeshu, referring to a precious stone which was hard, and possibly white, or at least with an insignificant colour, and from which whole rings were sometimes made. A few scholars have suggested that Yahalom may refer to diamonds, owing to their hardness, though the skill of cutting diamonds had not been discovered before the classical era. Although the Septuagint's Onychion is the Greek term for onyx, onyx was not mined prior to the era of classical Greece. \\"Onyx\\" is derived from the Greek for fingernail, due to the pink-white veining. In the Syriac Peshitta of the sixth or seventh century (MS. B.21, Inferiore of the Ambrosian Library in Milan, Italy), the word used to describe this stone is ‹¢‹©‹•‹¨‹ê = naq'atha,The Old Testament in Syriac (According to the Peshitta Version), Part I, Leiden E. J. Brill 1977, p. 183. a word which is sometimes transliterated into Arabic as it is pronounced in Aramaic, mainly by Arabic- speaking Christians. Bar-Ali, a 9th-century Arab author, brings down two opinions about this stone, the naq'atha, saying, by one opinion, that it is \\"honey-coloured\\", and by the other opinion that it is \\"turquoise, a blue- coloured stone\\". In some versions of the Peshitta, the Aramaic word rendered for the same stone is shabzez, translated as \\"diamond\\". This may account for today's understanding of this word, although in ancient times yahalom may have meant something else. Of the well-known honey-coloured gemstones, we find citrine and hessonite garnet (both from Sri Lanka), while in Africa (Tanzania) we find imperial zircon, a honey-coloured stone with extreme brilliance. Spanish Jewish scholar Abraham ibn Ezra says the yahalom was a white stone. = Third row = *Le≈°em (◊ú÷∂◊©÷∂◊Å◊ù = in the masoretic text) / Ligurios (in the Septuagint) ‚Äì the names here seem to refer to places: Leshem and Liguria, respectively. Theophrastus mentions the fossilized pine resin, amber, called in Greek liggourrion or lyngurium, as does Dioscorides and A√´tius.Dioscorides, Materia Medica 2:100 In Greek antiquity, this stone was believed to have been the solidified urine of lynxes, and its name a mere corruption of lykos ouron, meaning white urine, presumably in reference to its colour. Pliny (who did not believe the stone existed) described the ligurios as having certain electrical properties, which a number of scholars have taken to imply that it referred to amber. Amber was one of the first items to have been discovered to have electrical properties (see Thales); the English stem electric- derives from the Latin word for amber (elektrum). In the Latin Vulgate the name was given as ligure, a Latinization apparently invented by Flavius Josephus, and equated with lyngurium, but Luther used hyacinth (jacinth), and during the Renaissance belief in lyngurium died away. Modern scholars are inclined to think that the stone must have been similar to the pale colour of natural gold (as opposed to the colour known as gold); The Midrash Rabba (Numbers Rabba 2:7) states that the mineral had a black colour, and is there named ◊õ◊ï◊ó◊ú◊ô◊ü, meaning the antimony known as stibium. Rabbi Saadia Gaon, and other medieval rabbinical commentators, argued that the gem itself was an onyx (Judeo-Arabic: ◊í◊ñ◊¢ = ÿ¨Ÿéÿ≤Ÿéÿπ ), although Abraham ibn Ezra casts doubt on the accuracy of Rabbi Saadia's tradition.Abraham ibn Ezra, Commentary on the Penteuch, Genesis 2:11. Modern English translations use either amber or jacinth. *≈†evo (◊©÷∞◊Å◊ë◊ï÷π = in the masoretic text) / Achates (in the Septuagint) ‚Äì achates definitely refers to agate, and ≈°evo may be cognate with the Assyrian term subu, meaning agate. Agates were common in Egypt and Assyria, and were regarded as a potent talismans. Isidore of Seville lists agate as being among the black gems.Isidore of Seville, The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville (ch. XVI on Stones and Metals), ed. Barney, Lewis, Beach & Berghof, Cambridge University Press 2006, p. 325 The Midrash Rabba (Numbers 2:7) appears to argue for the jewel in question having been a grey variety. Conversely, in Rabbi Saadia Gaon's (882‚Äì942 CE) Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch, as well as in the medieval Samaritan Arabic translation, the stone is rendered as ÿ≥ÿ®ÿ¨, meaning obsidian. *A·∏•lamah (◊ê÷∑◊ó÷∞◊ú÷∏◊û÷∏◊î = in the masoretic text) / Amethystos (in the Septuagint) ‚Äì amethystos refers to amethyst, a purple mineral which was believed to protect against getting drunk from alcohol (amethyst's name refers to this belief, and literally translates as \\"not intoxicating\\"), and was commonly used in Egypt. A·∏•lamah appears to be derived from a term meaning strong, though it may equally be derived from Ahlamu, a place where amethysts were found; in the Babylonian Targum, a·∏•lamah is translated into a term meaning strong drinking, which appears to reference beliefs about amethyst, but in the Jerusalem Targum, it is translated into a term meaning calf's eye. The Midrash Rabba (Numbers Rabba 2:7), while describing the stone's colour, says: \\"[It is] similar to clear wine whose redness is not too strong.\\" = Fourth row = *Tar≈°ƒ´≈° (◊™÷∑÷º◊®÷∞◊©÷¥◊Å◊ô◊©÷¥◊Å = in the masoretic text) / Chrysolithos (in the Septuagint) ‚Äì in some other places the Septuagint instead has anthrax (meaning coal) where the masoretic reads tarshish. tar≈°ƒ´≈° is thought by scholars to refer to tarshish, in reference to the main source of the mineral being tarshish. Chrysolithos does not refer specifically to chrysolite, which was named much later, but is an adjective which translates as \\"gold-stone\\", meaning either that it was golden, as in the Libyan desert glass, or that it contained flecks of gold. With golden flecks it could refer to lapis lazuli, which would fit the Targums' description of the gem being \\"the colour of the sea\\". As a golden material if translucent, it could refer to topaz or to amber, and since chrysolithos came to mean topaz in particular by the classical era, some scholars favour this as being the most likely use, though it would be jarring for there to be two different translucent yellow gemstones so close to one another on the breastplate. If an opaque golden material, it could refer to a yellow form of jasper or of serpentine, which were commonly used in Egypt and Babylon. It may even be the case that the Septuagint is mistaken, and the masoretic text's tar≈°ƒ´≈° is a corruption of asshur (they are similar when spelled using the Hebrew alphabet), referring to Assyria's quintessential exported mineral, flint. The 2nd century Jewish translator, Symmachus, renders the word as yakinthos, meaning \\"jacinth\\", or \\"hyacinth\\"., s.v. Exo. 28:20. There is little certainty among scholars in regard to which of these is the most likely to be the jewel in question. *≈†oham (◊©÷π◊Å◊î÷∑◊ù = in the masoretic text) / Beryllios (in the Septuagint) ‚Äì in some other places the Septuagint instead has onychion, or smaragdos, or the phrase leek-green stone, where the masoretic reads ≈°oham; beryllios refers to beryl but earlier to the blue-green colour of the sea, onychion refers to onyx, and smaragdos literally means green stone and refers to a bright columnar crystal (either beryl or rock crystal). Onyx is an opaque and banded stone, while smaragdos is translucent, and beryl is cloudy, and all these come in several colours. ≈†oham could be derived from the Assyrian word samtu, meaning dark or cloudy; it could be derived from the Arabic word meaning pale, in which case it fits more with onyx and certain forms of beryl, excluding the emerald, with Heliodor being the form of beryl fitting the leek green description; it could be derived from the Arabic word musahham, meaning striped garment, and therefore very definitely describing something like onyx; or it could be a place name, for example there is a place in Yemen named Soheim. Jewish tradition generally favours leek-green beryl (heliodor) as the likely meaning of ≈°oham, though scholars think it is more likely to be malachite, which can be green enough to be compared to smaragdos and the blue-green colour of the sea (the original meaning of beryllios), is cloudy enough to be compared to a cloudy form of beryl, and is striped and opaque enough to be confused for a form of onyx. According to Epiphanius‚Äô Treatise on the Twelve Stones (Epiphanius de Gemmis), the beryl was \\"white like a cloud\\". Scholars point out that the Syriac form of the word is ber≈´lƒÅ and/or bel≈´ra, the latter evidently going back to a Pahlevi form (the old Persian tongue), and all in turn to the Sanskrit ‡§µ‡•à‡§°‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø = vai·∏ç≈´rya (Pali: ve·∏∑uriya·πÅ), the gemstone which is called in English, \\"cat's eye, beryl\\", a variety of chalcedonic quartz that has a chatoyant lustre resembling the eye of a cat when cut. *Ya≈°feh (◊ô÷∏◊©÷∞◊Å◊§÷µ◊î = in the masoretic text) / Iaspis (in the Septuagint) ‚Äì in reference to the Septuagint and Josephus, scholars suspect that yasepheh may be the original reading. Although yasepheh and iaspis are cognate to jasper, they do not quite have the same meaning; while jasper is usually red, the mineral which the Greeks called iaspis was generally a richly green one (the most prized form of jasper), and scholars think this is most likely to be the colour referred to by yasepheh; the ambiguity of the term is present in the Targums, where the jewel is variously identified as a ruby (which is red), as a hyacinth (which is yellow), or as an emerald (which is green). In the Babylonian Talmud,Baba Bathra 75a one opinion states that the gemstone was the same as kadkhod,q.v. Isaiah 54:12 a stone described by Bar-Ali as being al-karkahan = ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ±ŸÉ⁄æŸÜ (the Baghdadi onyx), \\"a kind of gemstone from which they cut [smaller] stones for setting in ouches\\". Rabbi Saadia Gaon, however, in his Judeo-Arabic translation of Isaiah,Isaiah 54:12 translates kadkhod as karkand, a red variety of precious stone. Josephus, quoting from one version of the Septuagint, says that it was a beryl.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, iii.vii ¬ß 5 The Midrash Rabba (Numbers Rabba 2:7) says that the stone was varicolored, meaning, all of the colours combined were to be found in the ya≈°feh. = 12 jewels in the New Testament = In the New Testament Book of Revelation is the description of a city wall, with each layer of stones in the wall being from a different material; in the original Koine Greek, the layers are given as iaspis, sapphiros, chalcedon, smaragdos, sardonyx, sardion, chrysolithos, beryllos, topazion, chrysoprason, yacinthos, amethystos. (Nestle-Aland edition) This list appears to be based on the Septuagint's version of the list of jewels in the Breastplate ‚Äì if the top half of the breastplate was rotated by 180 degrees, and the bottom half turned upside down, with Onchion additionally swapping places with Topazion, the lists become extremely similar; there are only four differences: * Onchion (literally onyx) has become sardonyx (red onyx) * Anthrax has become chalcedon (literally meaning chalcedony, of which the red variety is the most common). Anthrax literally means coal, presumably meaning the red colour of burning coal. * Ligurios has become chrysoprason. Scholars suspect that ligurios was a pale yellowish mineral, and although chrysoprase now refers to a specific gemstone which is generally apple-green in colour, in earlier times it referred to gems of a yellowish leek-green, such as peridot; chrysoprase literally means golden leek. * Achates (agate) has been replaced by yacinthos (jacinth). According to classical rabbinical literature, the specific agate was of a sky-blue colour, and though jacinth now refers to a red-tinted clear gem, this was not the case at the time the Book of Revelation was written, and at that time jacinth appears to have referred to a bluish gem; Pliny describes jacinth as a dull and blueish amethyst, while Solinus describes it as a clear blue tinted gem ‚Äì the modern sapphire. =Pattern= Whether there is any pattern to the choice of gemstones depends on their identity. Taking the majority view of scholars in regard to the identity of the gems, and including the implication from the Book of Revelation that the onyx at the end of the fourth row was a sardonyx, there are four colours ‚Äì red, green, yellow, and blue ‚Äì each represented by a clear gem (red ‚Äì carbuncle, green ‚Äì heliodor, yellow ‚Äì chrysolite, blue ‚Äì amethyst), an opaque gem (red ‚Äì carnelian/red jasper, green ‚Äì green jasper, yellow ‚Äì yellow jasper/yellow serpentine, blue ‚Äì lapis lazuli), and a striped gem (red ‚Äì sardonyx, green ‚Äì malachite, yellow ‚Äì pale golden agate, blue ‚Äì sky-blue agate). The four colours of red, green, yellow, and blue, are the first four colours (apart from black and white) distinguished by languages, and are distinguished in all cultures with at least six colour distinctions (the other two being black and white). These colours roughly correspond to the sensitivities of the retinal ganglion cells. (The retinal ganglia process colour by positioning it within a blue to yellow range, and separately positioning it within a red to green range.)

He is notable for his command over a Polish unit in Siberia during the Russian Civil War, and the commander of the defence of Warsaw during the siege in 1939. Biography At the outbreak of World War I Walerian Czuma joined the Pi≈Çsudski's Polish Legions. He was taken POW by the Russian Army and imprisoned in the infamous Butyrka prison. Later he was sentenced to forced resettlement in Siberia. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 he started to organise Polish military units in Siberia, which eventually became known as the Polish 5th Rifle Division. After the collapse of Kolchak's anti-Bolshevik movement, the Polish 5th Rifle Division, stranded in Siberia, was forced to surrender to the Red Army and Czuma was again imprisoned in Moscow. After the Riga Peace Treaty he was allowed to return to Poland, where he rejoined the Polish Army. From 1922 he served as the commanding officer of the 19th Infantry Division. Between 1927 and 1928 he was the commander of the Wilno Fortified Area. Later he was the commanding officer of the 5th Division. In March 1938 he was assigned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs as the commanding officer of the Border Guards (Polish Stra≈º Graniczna). Between the wars Czuma was also an active member of several social organisations, among them the Guards of the Graves of Polish Heroes society which initiated the construction of Lw√≥w Eagles mausoleum in ≈Åyczak√≥w Cemetery in Lw√≥w. Tomb of Walerian Czuma and his brother at Warsaw's PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery After the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War of 1939 he declined to leave Warsaw together with the government and the civilian authorities. On 3 September Marshal of Poland Edward ≈ömig≈Çy-Rydz ordered the creation of an improvised Command of the Defence of Warsaw (Dow√≥dztwo Obrony Warszawy) and Czuma became its commander. He commanded all the units fighting in the Siege of Warsaw, for which he was awarded the Virtuti Militari medal. On 28 September 1939, Czuma was taken POW by the Germans and remained in various POW camps for the rest of World War II. After he was liberated from the Oflag VII-A Murnau POW camp in Murnau am Staffelsee, Germany, by the American forces, he joined the Polish Army in the West. The new communist authorities deprived him of Polish citizenship and Czuma chose to remain an emigre in the United Kingdom, where he died at Penley near Wrexham in 1962. He was initially buried at Wrexham Cemetery but in July 2004 his remains and those of his brother W≈Çadys≈Çaw were moved to PowƒÖzki Cemetery in Warsaw. World War 2 gravestones gallery.

Prince was one of the most distinct and popular voices in sports broadcast history, known for his gravel voice, unabashed style and clever nicknames and phrases, which came to be known as \\"Gunnerisms.\\" His unique manner influenced a number of broadcasters after him, including Pittsburgh Penguins voice Mike Lange and Pittsburgh Steelers color analyst Myron Cope. Prince called Pirates games from 1948 to 1975, including the World Series championship years of 1960 and 1971. Nationally, he broadcast the 1960, 1966, and 1971 World Series and the 1965 All-Star Game for NBC, as well as the first year (1976) of ABC's Monday Night Baseball. He also broadcast at different times for other Pittsburgh-area sports teams, including Steelers football and Penguins hockey. Early life and career Born in Los Angeles, California, Prince's father was a former West Point football player and a career military man. An Army brat, he attended many schools before graduating from Schenley High School in Pittsburgh. An athlete himself, he lettered in swimming at the University of Pittsburgh. Prince worked for radio station WJAS, then landed a sports show on KDKA-TV. Prince joined Rosey Rowswell in the Pirates' broadcast booth as a commentator in , and he was promoted to the top spot shortly after Rowswell's death in February 1955. He also broadcast Pittsburgh Steelers and Penn State football and once a Duquesne basketball game in the 1950s. As a result of his distinct voice, knowledge of baseball, and high-profile persona, Prince was very popular among Pirates supporters. Prince was a fixture on team broadcasts for three decades on KDKA-AM, a clear channel radio station that could be heard throughout the eastern United States after sundown. A regular smoker and social drinker, the fun-loving Prince jumped from the third floor of the Chase Hotel in St. Louis into a swimming pool in 1957, on a dare by Pirates third baseman Gene Freese. =Pairing with Jim Woods= Many veteran observers believe Prince did his best work while paired with longtime sidekick Jim \\"The Possum\\" Woods and vice versa in the 1960s, which coincided with the rise of the Pirates as a championship-caliber team. It was Woods who first referred to Prince as \\"The Gunner.\\" Some say this was because of his staccato, rapid-fire style, others claim it was the result of an incident with a jealous, gun- toting husband. Woods allegedly recounted to an interviewer in Cleveland that two decades ago, during Woods' first spring-training with the Pirates in Fort Myers, Florida (1958), Prince had had a narrow escape from an encounter with a jealous husband who was packing a gun. To be sure, no one bled black and gold like Prince did before or since. Invariably, when his Buccos were trailing in the late innings by two runs, he'd say, \\"We need a bloop and a blast!\\" If calling for three runs, he would say, \\"We need a bleeder, a bloop and a blast!\\" His partisanship slipped over into Woods' style as well, and by the mid-'60s, The Possum would be announcing the presence of pinch-hitter (and reserve catcher) Jesse Gonder with, \\"Let's go up yonder with Jesse Gonder.\\" (The two would continue working together through the season, after which the flagship station KDKA refused to match a higher salary offer from KMOX in St. Louis for Woods to join Jack Buck in the Cardinals' booth; that partnership only lasted two seasons.) Prince was more of a rooter than a homer, in that he always showed respect to opponents and the game alike. Like the vast majority of broadcasters of his time, he rarely second-guessed players or managers. He was especially close friends with Milwaukee Braves pitchers Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette. Prince would reunite with Woods on two separate occasions for the USA Network. The first was on July 26, 1979 for a game between the Pirates and Cincinnati Reds in Pittsburgh. The second occasion was on August 28, 1980 for another Pirates game in Pittsburgh against the Reds. =\\"The Green Weenie\\"= In 1966, Prince popularized a good-luck charm known as the Green Weenie, a plastic rattle in the shape of an oversized green pickle that Pirates fans used to jinx opponents. \\"Never underestimate the power of the Green Weenie,\\" he liked to assure listeners. At the height of the term's popularity in 1966, Prince often punctuated the last out of a Bucs' victory by exclaiming, \\"The Great Green Weenie has done it again!\\" The pin's shape and color is derived from the pickle-shaped pins distributed to schoolchildren when they toured the H. J. Heinz Company factory in Pittsburgh. By late season, with the Pirates in a terrific pennant race with the Dodgers and Giants, some fans would parade a giant replica of the Green Weenie through the grandstand as a rally symbol. The hex symbol had started in the dugout with trainer Danny Whelan. Prince picked up on it and began talking about it on the broadcasts. No one thought to trademark the Green Weenie, so tens of thousands were sold in 1966, but Prince, Whelan, and the Pirates didn't profit from it. Pittsburgh finished in third place at , three games behind the league champion Dodgers; the Pirates lost their final three games, swept at home by the Giants. Later career =Departure from the Pirates= Soon after control of the broadcasts changed from Atlantic Richfield to Westinghouse Broadcasting in 1969, Prince had personal conflicts with Westinghouse management. Pirates management often interceded to quell tensions between Prince and KDKA executives. Finally, in 1975, inexplicably, Prince and sidekick Nellie King were fired, a decision that Pirates management did not try to reverse. Pirates fans were shocked by the news. Egged on by competing radio station WEEP, hundreds of supporters held a parade and downtown rally. Several Pirates players also went to bat for him, but rehiring Prince was never a consideration. KDKA hired Milo Hamilton in December and distributed press kits at a news conference that had a cover sticker proclaiming, \\"The New Voice of the Pirates.\\" Hamilton was never popular with fans and while professional, never could compare with Prince‚Äôs charisma. After his time with the Pirates, Prince had stints calling Houston Astros baseball, Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, and ABC's Monday Night Baseball. He was frustrated that ABC wouldn't let him employ his usual style, and was removed from the primary Monday night broadcast team during his first season () before being dropped altogether after the season. He also was released by the Astros after a one-year stay; he later said that Houston didn't agree with him. His work with the Penguins was a cause of consternation for hockey fans because he didn't understand the game and didn't know the Penguins' personnel. Eventually he was taken off play-by- play and re-cast as an intermission interviewer. Eventually, he returned to Pirate baseball, thrilling his loyal fans, in 1982, calling a limited number of Pirates games for a cable station. =May 3, 1985= Three years after his return, KDKA and the Pirates decided to make Prince a member of the regular radio broadcast team in 1985. Broadcaster Lanny Frattare suggested that KDKA should launch a campaign to have Prince recognized with the Hall of Fame's Ford Frick Award. At about the same time, independently, station executives Rick Starr and Chris Cross decided Prince should have a role on the radio broadcasts. The announcement came days after he had been released from a hospital for cancer treatments. Prince returned to the Pirates broadcast booth on May 3 to announce the middle three innings of the game between the Pirates and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Weakened from mouth cancer, Prince was able to announce only two innings but was given three standing ovations. The Pirates scored nine runs in the fourth, the first inning that Prince announced, one for each year of his absence from the booth. In the next inning Prince called for first baseman Jason Thompson to park one \\"so we'll have a little bit of everything,\\" and Thompson homered; the Pirates won 16‚Äì2 to improve to . The 1985 team finished last in the majors at . Willie Stargell had retired three years earlier, and most of the 1979 championship team had disbanded. The fourth inning broadcast announced by Prince on May 3 was the fifth-most runs scored in any one inning (9) in Pirates franchise history. A commentator on KDKA-TV (Channel 2) referred to it on the 6 p.m. news as the \\"last revival of the Green Weenie,\\" Prince's good luck charm from 1966. Prince announced a few following homestands. Weeks later, he reported to the park for another game, but his illness forced him to go home after waiting through a long rain delay. Prince was unable to report for work again and was re-admitted to the hospital, where he died at age 68 on June 10. His brief funeral service on June 16 was attended by seven hundred. Honors and awards Prince was posthumously awarded the Ford C. Frick Award by the Baseball Hall of Fame as a broadcaster in .1986 Ford C. Frick Award Winner Bob Prince He also was a 1986 inductee in the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame. Even today, his name remains synonymous with Pirates baseball including the naming of the new \\"Gunner's Lounge\\" at PNC Park in 2012.What to Eat at PNC Park, Home of the Pittsburgh Pirates - Eater In 1999, Prince was selected for the Pride of the Pirates award, a lifetime achievement honor given annually to a member of the organization.

The redoubt was built after the end of the Battle of Albert (25‚Äì29 September 1914), and as French and later British attacks on the Western Front became more formidable, the Germans added fortifications and trench positions near the original lines around Hawthorn Ridge. At on 1 July 1916, the British fired a huge mine beneath the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. Sprung ten minutes before zero hour, it was one of 19 mines detonated on the first day of the Battle of the Somme; the detonation of this mine was filmed by Geoffrey Malins. The attack on the redoubt by part of the 29th Division of VIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston) was a costly failure. Hunter-Weston had ordered the mine to be fired early to protect the advancing infantry from falling debris but this also gave the Germans time to occupy the rear lip of the mine crater. When British parties advanced across no man's land to occupy the crater, they were engaged by German small-arms fire. A few British soldiers reached the objective but at noon they were ejected by a German counter-attack. The success of the German defence of the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt crater contributed to the failure of the British attack on the rest of the VIII Corps front. The British reopened the tunnel beneath the Hawthorn Ridge crater three days later and reloaded the mine with explosives for the Battle of the Ancre . The new mine was fired on 13 November in support of an attack on Beaumont-Hamel by the 51st (Highland) Division of V Corps. The Scottish infantry advanced from a trench from the German lines, half the distance of 1 July, with the support of tanks, an accurate creeping barrage and an overhead machine-gun barrage. Beaumont-Hamel was captured and prisoners taken. Background =1914‚Äì1915= The 26th (W√ºrttemberg) Reserve Division Franz von Soden) of the XIV Reserve Corps, arrived on the Somme in late September 1914, attempting to advance westwards towards Amiens. By 7 October, the advance had ended and temporary scrapes had been occupied. Fighting in the area from the Somme north to the Ancre, subsided into minor line-straightening attacks by both sides. Underground warfare began on the Somme front, which continued when the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) took over from the French Second Army at the end of July 1915. Miners brought from Germany late in 1914 tunnelled under Beaumont- Hamel and the vicinity to excavate shelters in which infantry companies could shelter and against which even heavy artillery could cause little damage. On the Somme front, a construction plan of January 1915, by which Falkenhayn intended to provide the western armies with a means to economise on infantry, had been completed. Barbed-wire obstacles had been enlarged from one belt wide to two belts wide and about apart. The front line had been increased from one trench to three, apart, the first trench () to be occupied by sentry groups, the second () to accommodate the front-trench garrison and the third trench for local reserves. The trenches were traversed and had sentry-posts in concrete recesses built into the parapet. Dugouts had been deepened from to , apart and large enough for An intermediate line of strong points (the ) about behind the front line had also been built. Communication trenches ran back to the reserve line, renamed the second line, which was as well built and wired as the first line. The second line was built beyond the range of Allied field artillery, to force an attacker to stop and move field artillery forward before assaulting the line. =1915‚Äì1916= On New Year's Eve 1915, a small mine was sprung under Redan Ridge north of Beaumont-Hamel, followed by German mine explosions on January. British mines were blown on January 1916 and both sides sprung mines in February; the Germans then dug a defensive gallery parallel to the front line to prevent surprises. On the night of a German raid by II Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 119 (RIR 119) took place near Y Ravine, against the 2nd South Wales Borderers of the 29th Division and caused 112 casualties, for a loss of three killed and one man wounded. A big raid by the British on 30 April was seen by alert defenders and repulsed by small-arms fire and artillery as soon as it began. A report by the local German commander, showed that the preparations for the raid had been noticed a week before the attempt. After the Second Battle of Champagne in 1915, construction of a third line another back from the had been begun in February 1916 and was nearly complete on the Somme front by 1 July. Divisional sectors north of the Albert‚ÄìBapaume road were about wide. German artillery was organised in a series of (barrage sectors). A telephone system was built with lines buried deep, for behind the front line, to connect the front line to the artillery. The Somme defences had two inherent weaknesses which the rebuilding had not remedied: The first was that the front trenches were on a forward slope, lined by white chalk from the subsoil and easily seen by ground observers. The second was that the defences were crowded towards the front trench, with a regiment having two battalions near the front-trench system and the reserve battalion divided between the and the second line, all within of the front line, accommodated in the new deep dugouts. Prelude =German defensive preparations= The headwaters of the Ancre river flow west to Hamel through the Ancre valley, past Miraumont, Grandcourt, Beaucourt and St. Pierre Divion. On the north bank, pointing south-east, lie the Auchonvillers spur, with a lower area known as Hawthorn Ridge, Beaucourt spur descending from Colincamps and Grandcourt spur crowned with the village of Serre. Shallow valleys link the spurs, the village of Beaumont-Hamel lies in the valley between Auchonvillers and Beaucourt spurs. A branch in the valley known as Y Ravine lies on the side of Hawthorn Ridge. In 1916, the front of VIII Corps lay opposite the line from Beaucourt to Serre, facing the series of ridges and valleys, beyond the German positions to the east. The German front line ran along the eastern slope of Auchonvillers spur, round the west end of Y Ravine to Hawthorn Ridge, across the valley of Beaumont-Hamel to the part of Beaucourt spur known as Redan Ridge, to the top of the Beaucourt valley to Serre. An intermediate line known to the British as Munich Trench began at Beaucourt Redoubt and ran north to Serre. The second position ran from Grandcourt to Puisieux and the third position was further back. No man's land was about wide from the Ancre northwards and narrowed to about beyond the redoubt on Hawthorn Ridge. The ground was flat and unobstructed, except for a sunken road from the Auchonvillers‚ÄìBeaumont-Hamel road and a low bank near the German front trench. The German front had several shallow salients, flanks, a bastion at the west end of Y Ravine and cover in the valleys to the east. Beaumont-Hamel commanded the valley, which the VIII Corps divisions were to cross and had been fortified. Beaucourt Ridge further back, gave a commanding view to German artillery observers, who could see the gun flashes of British field artillery, despite the guns being dug in. British observers could not see beyond the German support trenches and the convex slope on the British side of no man's land, made it difficult for heavy artillery to hit the front position, parts of which was untouched by the preliminary bombardment. As signs of an Allied offensive increased during 1916, the lessons of the Second Battle of Artois and the Battle of H√©buterne in 1915, were incorporated into the defences of the Somme front. Observation posts were built in each defence sector, more barbed wire was laid and more telephone interception stations were installed, at the same time that more emphasis was laid on German telephone security. In early March and from the chief engineer of the 2nd Army inspected the first position in the area of the 26th Reserve Division; only in the area of RIR 119 at Beaumont-Hamel and the trenches to the west around Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt, were there enough shell-proof concrete posts. German infantry made a great effort to gather intelligence, patrol and raid the British lines to snatch prisoners; the British became more experienced in responding to local attacks and began to use the same tactics. In May, Soden wrote that at least of artillery ammunition were necessary, to ensure the success of a raid. On the night of a raiding party of RIR 119 failed to get forward, when the German artillery fired short. =British offensive preparations= Special arrangements were made by the 29th Division to capture Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. Three tunnels were dug under no man's land by tunnellers of the Royal Engineers. The first tunnel was to be a communication link to the Sunken Lane (shown in the film The Battle of the Somme, released in August 1916). British units had just moved into the Sunken Lane and the tunnel constructed by 252nd Tunnelling Company served to link it with the old British front line. In the early hours of 1 July, the 1st Battalion, The Lancashire Fusiliers were to use it to reach the Sunken Lane, ready to attack Beaumont-Hamel. Two other tunnels, First Avenue and Mary, named after the communications trenches leading into them, were Russian saps dug to within of the German front line, ready to be opened at on 1 July, as emplacements for batteries of Stokes mortars. The 252nd Tunnelling Company placed mine H3 north of First Avenue and Mary, beneath the German stronghold on the ridge. The miners had dug a gallery for about from the British lines about underground beneath Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt on the crest of the ridge and charged it with of Ammonal. The VIII Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Aylmer Hunter-Weston, wanted the mine to be sprung four hours before the offensive began, so that the crater could be captured and consolidated in time for the alarm on the German side to have died down. On 15 June, the Fourth Army headquarters, ruled that all the mines on 1 July should be blown no later than eight minutes before zero; an unsatisfactory compromise was reached with Hunter-Weston to detonate the Hawthorn Redoubt mine ten minutes before zero hour. An earlier detonation of the H3 mine in the VIII Corps sector was expected to divert German attention to the north bank of the Ancre, which would help the attacks of X Corps and XV Corps further south, where success was more important. Opinion in the 29th Division was that time was needed for the d√©bris from the great mine to fall to earth, although it was demonstrated that all but dust had returned to the ground within twenty seconds. Firing the mine early conformed to the plan to occupy the crater quickly but it required the heavy artillery bombardment of the redoubt and adjacent trenches to lift during the assault. All of the VIII Corps heavy artillery was ordered to lift at and the field artillery to lift at A light shrapnel barrage fired by the divisional field artillery was to continue on the front trench until zero hour; in the 29th Division sector, half of the guns were to lift three minutes early. =British plan of attack= The 29th and 4th divisions were to advance east across the valley of Beaumont-Hamel to an intermediate line on Beaucourt spur and then advance to the second position in hours. British artillery fire would lift off the German front trench at zero hour and the field artillery was to move eastwards in six lifts, from the first objective after zero and then lift in succession after about twenty minutes on each of the further objectives, the heavy artillery lifting five minutes earlier each time. The divisional field artillery was to lift for as each infantry advance began and then move east at per minute. Each division was to reserve two 18-pounder batteries ready to advance at short notice; visual signalling, runners, flares, signals to contact patrol aircraft, wide-angle signalling lamps were provided. Bombers (hand-grenade specialists in the infantry) carried flags to mark the front line. Battle =1 July= A witness to the detonation of the Hawthorn Ridge mine was British cinematographer Geoffrey Malins, who filmed the 29th Division attack. Malins set up on the side of the White City trenches, about from Hawthorn Ridge, ready for the explosion at As soon as the mine blew, the bombardment on the German front line by heavy artillery lifted and Stokes mortars, which had been placed in advanced sites, along with four more in the sunken lane in no man's land, began a hurricane bombardment on the front trench. The regimental history of RIR 119 recorded that and that the detonation was the signal for the German infantry to stand to at the shelter entrances. Two platoons of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (86th Brigade, 29th Division) with four machine-guns and four Stokes mortars, rushed the crater. As the British troops reached the near lip, they were engaged by small arms fire from the far lip and the flanks. At least three of the 1st Platoon ( Renz) and the members of the 2nd Platoon ( B√∂hm) on the left side of the platoon area had been killed in the mine explosion. The entrances to the 3rd Platoon ( Breitmeyer) and some of the 2nd Platoon (underground shelters) caved in and only two escaped. The rest of the 9th Company in a (deep-mined dug- outs) survived but the entrances were blocked and the troops inside were not rescued until after the British attack. The detonation was swiftly followed by a German counter-barrage and in the next few minutes, German machine-guns opened fire all along the front. The British divisions forming up in no man's land to reach the jumping-off position short of the German front line, were caught in the machine-gun fire and suffered many casualties. German troops occupied the far lip of the crater at the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt, turned machine-guns and trench mortars to the right and left flanks and fired into the British troops as they tried to advance. The attack on the redoubt and the rest of the VIII Corps front collapsed and was a costly failure. By the only ground held by the 29th Division was the western lip of the crater. Two German platoons bombed from shell-hole to shell-hole towards the crater, forcing the survivors to retire to the British front line. RIR 119 suffered most in the mine explosion beneath the redoubt. Casualties in the 86th Brigade were whom killed and reported missing. =13 November= After the detonation of the Hawthorn Ridge mine on 1 July, the Royal Engineers began work on a new mine, loaded with of ammonal, which was placed beneath the crater of the first explosion. On 13 November 1916, two brigades of the 51st (Highland) Division attacked the first objective (green line) at Station road and Beaumont-Hamel, then the final objective (yellow line) at Frankfort Trench, with three battalions, the fourth providing carrying parties. Six minutes before zero, the leading battalion of the right brigade moved beyond the British wire and advanced when the new mine at Hawthorn Crater was blown. The Scottish troops moved past the east end of Y Ravine and reached the first objective at , with a stray party from the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division. The battalion pushed on and then withdrew slightly to Station Road. On the left, fire from Y Ravine held up the advance and at another battalion reinforced the attack. Troops skirted the ravine to the north and early in the afternoon a battalion from the reserve brigade attacked Beaumont-Hamel from the south, joined by troops in the vicinity. The left flank brigade was held up by uncut wire to the south of Hawthorn Crater and by massed machine-gun fire north of the Auchonvillers‚ÄìBeaumont-Hamel road. Two tanks were sent up, one bogging between the German front and support lines and the other north of the village. Consolidation began and three battalions were withdrawn to the German reserve line and reinforced at while one battalion formed a defensive flank to the south, as the positions reached by the 63rd Division on the right were unknown. Aftermath =Analysis= The detonation of the Hawthorn Ridge mine, ten minutes before the general attack commenced, was not considered to be the main cause of the lack of surprise on 1 July. Lanes had been cut through the British wire, bridges had been placed over rear trenches several days earlier; a bombardment had been fired at each morning for a week. Zero Day was not known to the Germans but the imminence of the expected attack was made evident by the springing of the mine. The lifting of the heavy artillery bombardment made it safe for the Germans to emerge and occupy the front defences, despite the surface destruction caused by the preliminary bombardment and the cutting of much of the wire. The Hawthorn Ridge sector was not attacked again until 13 November, during the Battle of the Ancre. For this attack another mine was laid beneath Hawthorn Ridge, this time containing of explosives and Hawthorn Ridge as well as Beaumont-Hamel were captured. The 51st Division had attacked from , obscured by fog and supported by tanks, a creeping barrage and a machine-gun barrage, which caught German infantry in the open and the Highlanders took An analysis by the German 1st Army concluded that the positions were lost because of weeks of bombardment, part of which was from the flank and rear of the position, although the original deep-mined dug-outs survived. The British fired a hurricane bombardment each morning to lull the defenders with familiarity and the attack began in the morning after a short period of drumfire. Fog reduced the effect of the German counter- barrage and the front-line infantry were left to repulse the first attack. The 12th Division was severely criticised and the number of recruits in the division from Polish Upper Silesia was blamed. Troops had been slow to emerge from cover and were overrun, no initiative being shown by unit leaders or the divisional command, which failed to act until the 1st Army headquarters intervened.

Using WSIF, WSDL can become the centerpiece of an integration framework for accessing software running on diverse platforms which uses different protocols. The software needs to be described using WSDL and have a binding included in its description that the client's WSIF framework has a provider for. WSIF defines and comes packaged with providers for local Java, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), Java Message Service (JMS), and Java EE Connector Architecture (JCA) protocols, which means that a client can define an EJB or a Java Message Service-accessible service directly as a WSDL binding and access it transparently using WSIF, using the same API one would use for a SOAP service or a local Java class.  Structure  In WSDL, a binding defines how to map between the abstract PortType and a real service format and protocol. For example, the SOAP binding defines the encoding style, the SOAPAction header, the namespace of the body (the targetURI), and so forth. WSDL allows multiple implementations for a Web service and multiple ports that share the same PortType. In other words, WSDL allows the same interface to have bindings to services like SOAP and IIOP. WSIF provides an API to allow the same client code to access any available binding. As the client code can be written to the PortType, it can be a deployment or configuration setting (or a code choice) which port and binding it uses. WSIF uses providers to support these multiple WSDL bindings. A provider is a piece of code that supports a WSDL extension and allows invocation of the service through that particular implementation. WSIF providers use the J2SE JAR service provider specification, making them discoverable at runtime. Clients can utilize new implementations and delegate the choice of port to the infrastructure and runtime, which allows the implementation to be chosen on the basis of quality of service characteristics or business policy.  Bindings for EJBs, JMS, and JCA  WSIF defines additional binding extensions so that Enterprise JavaBean (EJBs), local Java classes, software accessible over message queues using the Java Message Service (JMS) API, and software that can be invoked using the Java Connector architecture can also be described in WSDL. WSIF is packaged with providers that allow transparent invocation given the corresponding WSDL description.  Description  WSIF enables developers to interact with abstract representations of Web services through their WSDL descriptions instead of working directly with the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) APIs, which is the usual programming model. With WSIF, developers can work with the same programming model regardless of how the Web service is implemented and accessed. WSIF allows stubless or completely dynamic invocation of a Web service, based upon examination of the metadata about the service at runtime. It also allows updated implementations of a binding to be plugged into WSIF at runtime and the calling service to defer choosing a binding until runtime. It is closely based on WSDL so it can invoke any service that can be described in the language. If a complicated enterprise software system consists of various pieces of software, developed over a period of decades‚ÄîEJBs, legacy apps accessed using Java's connector architecture, SOAP services hosted on external servers, old code accessed through messaging middleware‚Äîit is necessary to write software applications that use all these pieces to do useful things, where the differences in protocols, mobility of software, etc. conflict with one another. If the software is moved to a different server, the code breaks. The SOAP libraries used change‚Äîfor example, when one moves from using Apache SOAP to Apache Axis‚Äîas it uses a now-deprecated SOAP API. Something that was previously accessible as an EJB is now available through messaging middleware via JMS‚Äîagain, the code that uses the software must be fixed, or if one has an EJB which is offered as a SOAP service to external clients. Using SOAP results in a performance penalty compared to accessing the EJB directly. WSIF fixes these problems by allowing WSDL to be used as a normalized description of disparate software, and allows users to access this software without depending on a protocol or location. The separation of the API from the actual protocol also means there is flexibility‚Äîprotocols, location, etc. can be switched without having to recompile client code. If an externally available SOAP service becomes available as an EJB, users can use RMI/IIOP by changing the service description (the WSDL), without making any modification in applications that use the service. WSDL's extensibility, its capability to offer multiple bindings for the same service, deciding on a binding at runtime, etc. can be exploited.  Differences between WSIF and Axis  Axis is an implementation of SOAP. It includes on the server-side infrastructure for deploying web service implementations and then routing SOAP messages between clients and those implementations. It also implements the JAX-RPC specification for invoking SOAP services. WSIF is similar to the client piece of Axis, in that it is used for invoking services. However, WSIF's API is WSDL-driven and protocol independent; it allows protocol-specific code (\\"providers\\") to be plugged in. For invoking SOAP services, WSIF is packaged with an Axis provider, that uses Axis APIs (i.e. JAX-RPC) to do the invocation. So WSIF operates at a more abstract level than Axis.  Differences between WSIF and JAX-RPC  JAX-RPC is an API for invoking XML- based RPC services ‚Äì essentially its current scope is limited to invocation of SOAP services. WSIF is an API for invoking WSDL-described services, whether they happen to be SOAP services or not (for example, WSIF defines WSDL bindings so that EJBs, enterprise software accessible using JMS or the Java Connector architecture as well as local Java classes can all be described as first-class WSDL services and then invoked using the same, protocol- independent WSIF API).

Prelude The AIOC was the United Kingdom's \\"single largest overseas asset\\" and a \\"source of national pride\\" in the British post-war era of Clement Attlee, and Ernest Bevin. Even as late as the \\"1940s and early 1950s some high British officials still believed that Persian petroleum was actually and rightly British petroleum because it had been discovered by the British, developed by British capital, and exploited through British skill and British ingenuity.\\"William Roger Louis quoted in Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran Ed, by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004 , p.129 In stark contrast, Iranian Premier Mohammad Mosaddegh believed the 1933 concession granted to the AIOC by Iran was \\"immoral as well as illegal\\". Mosaddeq \\"challenged every aspect of the British commercial presence in Iran\\". The British feared that if Mosaddeq's policies prevailed, \\"nationalists throughout the world could abrogate British concessions with impunity.\\"William Roger Louis quoted in Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004 , p.148 Nationalization Prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh shaking hands with Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi The AIOC was nationalized by the Iranian Parliament in March 1951. In Iran this was enormously popular and seen as a long overdue staunching of the bleeding of its national wealth which could now be harnessed to fighting poverty in Iran. In Britain, the nationalisation was widely seen as an intolerable breach of contract or theft. British emissaries in the United States after the nationalisation, argued that allowing Iran to nationalise the oil company \\"would be widely regarded as a victory for the Russians\\" and would also \\"cause a loss of one hundred million pounds per annum in the United Kingdom's balance of payments, thus seriously affecting our rearmament program and our cost of living.\\"Kinzer, Stephen, All the Shah's Men : An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, Stephen Kinzer, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, p.90 British warships blockaded Abadan. On 22 August, the British cabinet imposed a series of economic sanctions on Iran. It prohibited exports of key British commodities, including sugar and steel, directed the withdrawal of all British personnel from Iranian oil fields and all but a hard core of about 300 administrators from Abadan and blocked Iran's access to its hard currency accounts in British banks.Kinzer, All the Shah's Men, (2003), p.110 After the withdrawal of the British workers in the fall of 1951, the Iranians felt confident that they could easily hire non-British technicians to run the industry and then quickly train their own nationals to replace them. This did not prove to be the case; the United States, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and West Germany all refused to make their technicians available to the nationalized Iranian industry. Only Italy agreed, demonstrating that most industrialized countries supported Britain over Iran in the nationalization dispute.\\"Heiss quoted in Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004 , p.182 In July 1952, the Royal Navy intercepted the Italian tanker Rose Mary and forced it into the British protectorate of Aden on the grounds that the ship's petroleum was stolen property. News that the Royal Navy was intercepting tankers carrying Iranian oil scared off other tankers and effectively shut down oil exports from Iran.Kinzer, All the Shah's Men, (2003), p.138 Supporters of the nationalization, including the National Poet of Iran Adib Boroumand, sent out propaganda in the form of poetry in support of Mossadegh's movement. Poems were read out on radio broadcasts, passed out to people on paper pamphlets, and published in newspapers. Coup d'√©tat The democratically elected government of Iran was overthrown on 19 August 1953, following a coup d'√©tat orchestrated by the United Kingdom and the United States, and Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh was ousted from power. During the coup, codenamed Operation Ajax, the CIA and MI6 restored Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to power. In August 1954, the AIOC was set under the control of an international consortium. Initially, ownership shares in the consortium proposed to be divided along the following lines: 40% to be divided equally (8% each) among the five major American companies; British Petroleum to have a 40% share; Royal Dutch/Shell to have 14%; and CFP, a French Company, to receive 6%. Iran now received 25% of the profits compared to 20% of the original treaty with the AIOC. Saudi Arabia and other oil- exploiting countries of the region received up to 50% of the profits in cooperation with American oil companies at the same time. It was only in 1980, after the US and British backed Shah regime was ousted through a people's uprising in 1979, that the oil company was nationalized into what is today known as the NIOC (National Iranian Oil Company).

History  Percy Crosby, creator of the popular \\"Skippy\\" comic strip (1923-1945), which had been adapted into the 1929 novel Skippy, the daytime children's radio serial Skippy (1932-1935), and the Oscar-winning 1931 film Skippy, had trademarked the name \\"Skippy\\" in 1925. When, in 1932, the Alameda, California food packer Joseph L. Rosefield began to sell its newly developed hydrogenated peanut butter, which it labeled \\"Skippy\\" without permission, Crosby successfully had the trademark invalidated in 1934. Rosefield persisted using the name and after Crosby was committed to an asylum and after the passage in 1946 of the Lanham Act, Rosefield was granted rights to the trademark. In 1955, Rosefield sold the brand to Best Foods. Its successor companies, most recently Unilever and Hormel, claim rights to the trademark over the objection of Crosby's heirs, and much litigation has occurred on this point over the decades, some of which has continued into the 2000s.Skippy.com website Skippy is sold in many different sizes, including a jar, known as the \\"Family Jar\\".

The crash led TAESA to ground its fleet and suspend operations a year later in 2000. Investigators determined that the crew didn't use the appropriate checklists prior to departure. During the climbout, the pilots were confused about what instructed heading to take during departure. Spatial disorientation was believed to be one factor in the crash of Flight 725. Aircraft The aircraft operating the flight was an McDonnell-Douglas DC-9-31, manufactured by McDonnell-Douglas, and first entered service with Trans Australia Airlines in February 1970. It was 29 years old at the time of the accident and accumulated more than 59,000 takeoff/landing cycles and 58,000 flight hours.

Designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and inspired by Disney/Pixar's Toy Story franchise, the attraction combines a carnival game and a third-generation Omnimover system. The attraction first opened at Magic Kingdom on November 3, 1998. Subsequent versions can be found at Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland, Disneyland Park in Paris, and Shanghai Disneyland. Although each ride may have a different name, all share the same major plot and characters. The ride formerly existed at Hong Kong Disneyland under the name Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, but was closed in September 2017. For a brief period from the Shanghai version's opening in 2016 until the Hong Kong version's closure in 2017, the attraction was only one of two that could be found at all six Disney castle parks worldwide (the other attraction being Dumbo the Flying Elephant).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Disney_theme_park_attractions Plot The backstory of the ride revolves around the attempts of Evil Emperor Zurg (voiced by Andrew Stanton in the Astro Blasters attractions and Frank Welker in Space Ranger Spin) steal the batteries (known as \\"crystallic fusion cells\\") used to power the space vehicles of the \\"Little Green Men\\" (voiced by Jeff Pidgeon and Debi Derryberry). Participants are \\"Star Command\\" raw recruits sent to defeat Zurg. The queue area is awash in the chartreuse, white, and bright blue hues of Buzz Lightyear himself (voiced by Pat Fraley, who does voice for all Buzz Lightyear attractions [minus the Shanghai and Japanese rides]). Since Buzz Lightyear is a toy, the attraction is cleverly scaled to give the illusion that one has just been reduced to the size of an action figure, featuring such detail as giant, exposed Philips screw heads and an explanation of the interactive phase of the ride that resembles a toy's instruction sheet, only on a gigantic scale. An Audio-Animatronic Buzz Lightyear figure and giant Etch-a-Sketch (Disneyland) and/or View-Master (Walt Disney World) provide explanation of the \\"mission\\" to destroy Zurg's secret weapon with your blasters. While his body is audio-animatronic, Buzz's face is actually a screen with a projection of computer animation, allowing better lipsync and more expressive features, making him look like a more realistic representation of the character from the films. Technical aspects \\"Astro Blasters\\" and \\"Space Ranger Spin\\" are equal parts shooting gallery and dark ride. Visitors board an Omnimover space vehicle featuring two laser pistols and a joystick. The pistols are used to shoot laser beams at targets of varying point values. Targets that are hit while lit up will produce much higher scores. A digital readout on the dashboard shows the player's score. The joystick allows full 360-degree rotation of the vehicle to assist in aiming. During the ride, if the ride slows down or completely stops (this is a result of either a handicapped guest or a ride breakdown) during the ride, this allows for \\"bonus points\\" as the pistols and targets do not turn off. There are 4 different shaped targets which are worth different numbers of points: round (100 points), square (1,000 points), diamond (5,000 points), and triangle (10,000 points). At the conclusion of the ride, the digital score flashes L1-L7 displaying the ranking or level achieved for the below scores: * Level 1 Star Cadet: 0 ‚Äì 1,000 * Level 2 Space Scout: 1,001 ‚Äì 10,000 * Level 3 Ranger 1st Class: 10,001 ‚Äì 100,000 * Level 4 Planetary Pilot: 100,001 ‚Äì 300,000 * Level 5 Space Ace: 300,001 ‚Äì 600,000 * Level 6 Cosmic Commando: 600,001 ‚Äì 999,998 * Level 7 Galactic Hero: 999,999+ Some of the rides feature an on-ride photo, which depending on the park may be available as a free electronic postcard via e-mail at the exit, or be available for purchase on the Disney's PhotoPass system. The photos include the player's score. If the score is in the top 100 highest of the day, the player's ranking may be included in the photo. The Top 10 players' scores are shown on the scoreboard at the exit queue. The top person gets their face posted on the screen. The Disneyland version once featured at-home play tied directly to the attraction itself via the Internet, however this is disabled. The installation at the Magic Kingdom utilizes an existing ride system by Arrow Development, originally constructed in 1972 for If You Had Wings. The ride was designed and manufactured by Sansei Technologies, Inc. with the corporation of Walt Disney Imagineering. History =Magic Kingdom= The layout and systems of the ride date all the way back to 1972. This space was originally home to If You Had Wings, an aviation themed ride sponsored by Eastern Airlines. Eastern Airlines dropped sponsorship of the ride for financial reasons in early June 1987. All Eastern themes were moved, and the ride was renamed If You Could Fly. If You Could Fly was closed down in January 1989. The installation of Space Ranger Spin also impacted the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover, which runs through the south show building. The Tomorrowland Transit Authority, or TTA as it is often called for short, had opened in 1975 as the WEDway PeopleMover. At that time, If You Had Wings was the attraction occupying the south show building. Three diorama windows were also positioned on the track: two on the right and one of the left. These allowed the Mexico, Jamaica, and Trinidad scenes to be visible to riders on the Tomorrowland Transit Authority in such a way as to hide all projectors, lights and other show support equipment. The diorama windows were altered once more when If You Had Wings was transformed into Delta Dreamflight. This was done because the windows no longer correctly lined up with show scenes. The first window was replaced with backlit panels depicting the ride's barnstormer scene. Window two looked into the Parisian Excursion scene, from a viewpoint which heavily distorted the tableau's forced perspective. The third window would have had TTA riders looking directly into an extremely bright light and so was completely obscured with plywood and black fabric. When the ride transitioned yet again into the current attraction of Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin in 1998, the first window was refitted with the diorama of the hair salon, and the second left open to look into the new attraction, though concern was expressed over the fact that this view allows TTA riders to look directly into banks of high-powered blacklights. At one point during Space Ranger Spin, it is possible to catch a glimpse of the TTA passing through the building. =Disneyland= Like the Magic Kingdom version at Walt Disney World, it uses infrastructure from previous attractions. Its show building originally housed the Circle-Vision 360¬∞ theater. In 1997, as part of a major makeover of Tomorrowland, the Circle-Vision theater was removed and the space became part of the queue for the now infamous Rocket Rods. The Rocket Rods, which were prone to breakdowns, ran from 1998 to 2000. This space was then unused until 2005, when Astro Blasters opened. Queue =Magic Kingdom= The queue of the ride shows different pictures of Buzz Lightyear and the Little Green Men. It also shows the battery cells and pipes plugging into Star Command. Guests then pass the Buzz Lightyear animatronic (This version of the animatronic has his wings open and is not holding anything). After listening to what he has to say, guests then leave that room and board the XP 37. Attached to them are ion laser canons and a joystick to spin the cart. =Disneyland= Astro Blasters has a lot more dialogue than Space Ranger Spin did. This ride's queue (as well as the other Astro Blasters/ Laser Blast) includes a walkie talkie with Buzz Lightyear on it reading his wrist communication device. The speakers provide backstory to the ride and how Zurg is attacking Green Planet, home of the Little green men. It also includes a picture of Zurg as wanted criminal number one. It has pictures of The green squadron leaving to attack. It also has posters describing the blasters and the XP 40 Star cruiser. In the Fast Pass line, there is a picture of Buzz Lightyear shooting a purple, green and orange colored alien. It also shows Lightyear leading a team of Space rangers as well as making a cameo for Princess Mira Nova from the film and the TV show Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command (BLoSC). The guests enter the briefing room to see Buzz Lightyear (This animatronic has no wings out and is holding an Astro Blaster. The Astro Blaster has a timer for when Buzz does his talking. As he says his line about finding Zurg's robot, the astro blaster lights up and blasts it's laser at the Etch a Sketch wiping off the picture of Zurg. However, in Paris, the laser can't keep up with the timer and the laser shines a little early). The animatronic gives a one-minute speech before a red alarm goes off signaling for the line to move along. The guest proceed down a long Corridor seeing the LGMs testing the Blasters. The guests then board the Star cruiser. =Shanghai Disneyland= The Queue has the look of a Star Tours type attraction and is the longest indoor queue for all of the versions of the attraction. It looks like the International Space Station. The walls are covered with pictures of Buzz Lightyear himself. Video monitors are displayed on some of those walls. The monitors play videos of the LGMS, and Zurg with his new weapon. Buzz Lightyear will also appear on the screen fighting the robots. Most of the videos show the Star command space ship. Each ship has a red and green blaster on each side. After the queue, guests will walk into the room where the space cruisers are. Attraction =Magic Kingdom= The Magic Kingdom's version of the ride, known as Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin, is the first Buzz Lightyear attraction, and the third Omnimover ride to operate in Tomorrowland's south show building. Unlike other versions of the attraction, Magic Kingdom's version features laser guns that are stationary. The ride begins when the cart enters a room with four blue colored astronauts holding guns aimed at a disco ball. The ride then enters a robot attack scene. An orange robot called the Box O' Bot, a blue and purple robot called the Giganto Bot, a green robot called the Battery Bot, and a Dog Bot are all present in this scene. The ride then slopes down a short hill into Planet Z. Here guests encounter many aliens including space chickens, space spiders, and others. There is also a volcano that is shooting green goo. The guests then enter Zurg's fortress where they see a battery delivery. Zurg is in his spaceship, which he calls his Spiderbot. In the next room the aliens show the guests that Zurg has escaped. The next room is the projection tunnel and in it Zurg is shooting at the guests. The final room shows Buzz Lightyear fighting with Zurg in the now destroyed Spiderbot. The Little green men help Buzz tear it apart. Then the unload area shows Buzz Lightyear thanking the guests while holding Zurg in the claw. Guests will then exit the ride into Store Command where they can purchase a photo of themselves on the ride. Mattel, having just transferred its sponsorship from the It's a Small World attraction thus in turn making that attraction sponsorless in nearby Fantasyland originally sponsored the Walt Disney World attraction from its opening to 1999 when all references to Mattel were removed from the attraction. The Disney World version has been without sponsorship ever since. =Disneyland= Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters at Disneyland Disneyland's version of the ride is called Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters. A key difference between this ride and its counterpart at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom is that its laser guns can be removed from their mounts to allow for more accurate shooting (similar to Men in Black: Alien Attack). The laser guns at Space Ranger Spin at Magic Kingdom cannot be removed from their mounts and have limited movement. The ride begins in the robot attack scene with The Box-O-Bot, The Gigantobot (who have changed positions and coloring as in WDW's version, The Box-O-Bot was neon orange and was on the left side of the track and the Gigantobot was dark blue and purple and was on the right side of the track. Now-Box O-Bot is just orange and is on the right and the Gigantobot has a red body and red ears). The Dogbot (who has now has a brown color) and the Batterybot (who is now red and has a target on his nose [This variation is in Paris and in California while a similar version with a target on his forehead is in Tokyo and Hong Kong]) are all present during this scene. There is also a mini Space Ranger in what looks like a X Wing. The Guests enter Zurg's Dreadnought down a hallway shooting batteries until you reach his laboratory. Zurg is shooting his \\"Zurgatronic Ion Blaster\\" (he dubbed it this in BLoSC). He is standing behind his now damaged Secret Weapon. Guests are about to transition into the next room which is completely dark while robots are being electrocuted trying to land the Dreadnought. The Guests enter Planet Z (In the French Version of the ride Buzz Lightyear says \\"Attention Space Rangers, you've landed on Planet Z! Be ready for anything). Guests can shoot aliens including a call back to the pterodactyl that belongs to Sid Phillips in the First Toy Story Film. Before leaving Planet Z, Zurg is laughing in when he thinks he has triumphed because he is about to shoot Green Planet. Guests then enter a light tunnel with Zs around it. The next room is similar to Space Ranger Spin. Buzz Lightyear is using his Astro Blaster to take down Zurg's Secret Weapon. The Green Squadron are helping Buzz take down the ship. The final room has the LGMs signing the receipt to return Zurg to Al's Toys Barn. Zurg Promises revenge as the Green Squadron thank the guests. Buzz Lightyear then thanks the guests. He tells them to put the Blasters where they belong and to check the score board. Guests exit the ride to Little Green Men's Store command. =Hong Kong Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland= Former site of Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters at Hong Kong Disneyland The Tokyo version is the original version of the ride and all of the ride's audio is in Japanese. At Hong Kong Disneyland, the ride is also called Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters and is a highly identical clone of the Tokyo version of the ride with a more elaborate queue. In Hong Kong however, the entire ride is in English and is only in trilingual for safety rules. Those two versions also featured a floating Planet Z out side of the space ship. Their version's cruisers are called XP 38. On March 3, 2017, Disney announced that the ride will be closing and would be replaced with an Ant-Man themed attraction titled Ant-Man and The Wasp: Nano Battle!, making this to be the second Marvel themed ride at Hong Kong Disneyland. The ride closed on August 31, 2017. However, Tokyo Disneyland's version is still operating today. =Disneyland Paris= At Disneyland Paris, Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast replaced the Circle-Vision 360¬∞ production Le Visionarium, which closed in 2004. This version of the ride is much like the Disneyland version, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, except for the presence of a tribute to Le Visionarium: When you are in the robot attack scene at the beginning, if you look beneath the left arm of the Box-O-Bot, you might be able to see 9-Eye (the Circumvisual Photodroid from Le Visionarium) hiding there. However, it is an easy to miss tribute. In the Paris version of the ride, the dialogue is the same but translated into French as well as English. In the queue, the Buzz Lightyear animatronic speaks English, as well as French for those who speak French, and don't understand English. Some areas of the ride provide both dialogues, but in the scene where Zurg's weapon is half-destroyed, it switches from English to French in a 6 dialogue loop as it does in the California version of the ride. This ride's cruiser is called the XP 41 calling back to the California version. This is also the version with the second longest indoor queue. = Shanghai Disneyland = The most recent version of this attraction is called Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue. It is more heavily based on the opening sequence of Toy Story 2, taking place on the planet where Zurg has his lair set up, and featuring the same style of robots as in the film. The Ride begins on a planet where the Little Green Men are helping guests take down the Zurg Bots. As well as Buzz being there using his laser. He is later seen fighting two of the robotic giants. Afterwards, the vehicles move into a mine where Zurg has been digging to get his weapon to fire at the planet. He sets up more robots as Buzz struggles to stop the Evil Emperor's mining. After a while, Zurg is defeated and swears he will get revenge. On your way out (like all the attractions) you see a scoreboard with the different scores from Level one to Seven. Home release and DisneyQuest attraction  In 2005, the Walt Disney Company premiered a home version of the ride in the form of an internet video game that allows users to connect with guests at the parks. The scores of each guest from the dark ride are tallied with the internet gamer and increase the points won. There was also a bumper car attraction at Walt Disney World's DisneyQuest with the name \\"Buzz Lightyear's Astroblasters,\\" where players rode and controlled enclosed bumper cars while shooting \\"balls\\" (black foam soccer balls) at each other.

It has a high thermal conductivity of up to 321 W/(m¬∑K), and is an electrical insulator. Its wurtzite phase (w-AlN) has a band gap of ~6 eV at room temperature and has a potential application in optoelectronics operating at deep ultraviolet frequencies. History and physical properties AlN was first synthesized in 1877. AlN, in the pure (undoped) state has an electrical conductivity of 10‚àí11-10‚àí13 Œ©‚àí1‚ãÖcm‚àí1, rising to 10‚àí5-10‚àí6 Œ©‚àí1‚ãÖcm‚àí1 when doped. Electrical breakdown occurs at a field of 1.2‚Äì1.8 V/mm (dielectric strength). It is predicted that the cubic zinc blend phase of AlN (zb-AlN) can exhibit superconductivity at high pressures. AlN has high thermal conductivity, high- quality MOCVD grown AlN single crystal has an intrinsic thermal conductivity of 321 W/m-K, consistent with first-principle calculation. For an electrically insulating ceramic, it is 70‚Äì210 W/(m¬∑K) for polycrystalline material, and as high as 285 W/(m¬∑K) for single crystals). Stability and chemical properties Aluminium nitride is stable at high temperatures in inert atmospheres and melts about 2200 ¬∞C. In a vacuum, AlN decomposes at ~1800 ¬∞C. In the air, surface oxidation occurs above 700 ¬∞C, and even at room temperature, surface oxide layers of 5‚Äì10 nm thickness have been detected. This oxide layer protects the material up to 1370 ¬∞C. Above this temperature bulk oxidation occurs. Aluminium nitride is stable in hydrogen and carbon dioxide atmospheres up to 980 ¬∞C. The material dissolves slowly in mineral acids through grain boundary attack, and in strong alkalies through attack on the aluminium nitride grains. The material hydrolyzes slowly in water. Aluminium nitride is resistant to attack from most molten salts, including chlorides and cryolite. Aluminium nitride can be patterned with a Cl2-based reactive ion etch. Manufacture AlN is synthesized by the carbothermal reduction of aluminium oxide in the presence of gaseous nitrogen or ammonia or by direct nitridation of aluminium. The use of sintering aids, such as Y2O3 or CaO, and hot pressing is required to produce a dense technical grade material. Applications Epitaxially grown thin film crystalline aluminium nitride is used for surface acoustic wave sensors (SAWs) deposited on silicon wafers because of AlN's piezoelectric properties. One application is an RF filter which is widely used in mobile phones, which is called a thin film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR). This is a MEMS device that uses aluminium nitride sandwiched between two metal layers. AlN is also used to build piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducers, which emit and receive ultrasound and which can be used for in-air rangefinding over distances of up to a meter. Metallization methods are available to allow AlN to be used in electronics applications similar to those of alumina and beryllium oxide. AlN nanotubes as inorganic quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes, which are isoelectronic with carbon nanotubes, have been suggested as chemical sensors for toxic gases. Currently there is much research into developing light-emitting diodes to operate in the ultraviolet using gallium nitride based semiconductors and, using the alloy aluminium gallium nitride, wavelengths as short as 250 nm have been achieved. In 2006, an inefficient AlN LED emission at 210 nm was reported. Among the applications of AlN are * opto-electronics, * dielectric layers in optical storage media, * electronic substrates, chip carriers where high thermal conductivity is essential, * military applications, * as a crucible to grow crystals of gallium arsenide, * steel and semiconductor manufacturing.

Popkin (2015). A Short History of the French Revolution. Hoboken, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc. p. 68. They played an active role in the 31 May 31 ‚Äì 2 June 1793 Paris uprisings that forced the expulsion of the Girondins from the National Convention, allowing the Montagnards to assume full control.Paul R. Hanson (2007). The A to Z of the French Revolution. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, Inc. p. 120. The Enrag√©s became associated with this term for their angry rhetoric appealing to the National Convention to take more measures that would benefit the poor. Jacques Roux, Jean-Fran√ßois Varlet, Jean Th√©ophile Victor Leclerc and Claire Lacombe, the primary leaders of the Enrag√©s, were strident critics of the National Convention for failing to carry out the promises of the French Revolution. The Enrag√©s were not a unified party, rather the individual figureheads that comprised the group identified as the Enrag√©s worked for their own objectives and evidence of cooperation is inconclusive.R. B. Rose (1965). Enrag√©s: Socialists of the French Revolution?. Sydney: Sydney University Press. p. 73. As individual political personalities, the Enrag√©s were cynical to the point of anarchism, suspicious of most political organizations and individuals and they resisted ties to others.R. B. Rose (1965). Enrag√©s: Socialists of the French Revolution?. Sydney: Sydney University Press. p. 41. The leaders did not see themselves as part of a shared movement and Roux even called for Varlet's arrest.R. B. Rose (1965). Enrag√©s: Socialists of the French Revolution?. Sydney: Sydney University Press. p. 74. The notion of the Enrag√©s as a cohesive group was perpetuated by the Jacobins as they lumped their critics Leclerc and Roux into one group.R. B. Rose (1965). Enrag√©s: Socialists of the French Revolution?. Sydney: Sydney University Press. p. 75.  Primary demands  In 1793, Jacques Roux delivered a speech at the National Convention known as the Manifesto of the Enrag√©s that represents the essential demands of the group. He asserted that freedom and equality were thus far \\"vain phantoms\\" because the rich had profited from the French Revolution at the expense of the poor. To remedy this, he proposed measures for price controls, arguing: \\"Those goods necessary to all should be delivered at a price accessible to all\\". He also called for strict punishments against actors engaged in speculation and monopoly. He demanded the National Convention take severe action to repress counterrevolutionary activity, promising to \\"show them [enemies] those immortal pikes that overthrew the Bastille\\". Lastly, he accused the National Convention of ruining the finances of the state and encouraged the exclusive use of the assignats to stabilize finances.Jacques Roux (25 June 1793). \\"Manifesto of the Enrag√©s\\". Translation by Mitchell Abidor. Marxist Internet Archive.  Formation  The Enrag√©s formed in response to the Jacobin's reluctance to restrain the capitalist bourgeois. Many Parisians feared that the National Convention protected merchants and shopkeepers at the expense of the sans-culottes. The Enrag√©s, though not a cohesive body, offered the working poor a platform to express their dissent. Their dissent was often conveyed through riots, public demonstrations and passionate oratory. Jacques Roux and Jean-Francois Varlet emboldened the Parisian working poor to approach the Jacobin Club on 22 February 1793 and persuade them to place price controls on necessary goods. The Enrag√©s appointed two females to represent the movement and their agenda to the National Convention. However, the National Convention refused to grant them an audience. This provoked outrage and criticism throughout Paris and some went as far as to accuse the National Convention of protecting the merchant elite's interests at the expense of the sans-culottes. Further attempts for the Enrag√©s to communicate their position were denied by the National Convention. Determined to be heard, they responded with revolt. They plundered the homes and businesses of the merchant elite, employing direct action to meet their needs. The Enrag√©s were noted for using legal and extra legal means to achieve their ends. The Enrag√©s were composed of members within the National Convention and the sans-culottes. They illuminated the internal and external war waged by the sans-culottes. They complained that the National Convention ordered men to fight on the battlefield without providing for the widows and orphans remaining in France. They emphasized the unavailability of basic necessities, particularly bread. In his Manifesto of the Enrag√©s, Jacques Roux colorfully expressed this sentiment to the National Convention, stating: \\"Is it necessary that the widows of those who died for the cause of freedom pay, at the price of gold, for the cotton they need to wipe away their tears, for the milk and the honey that serves for their children?\\". They accused the merchant aristocracy of withholding access to goods and supplies to intentionally drive up prices. Roux demanded that the National Convention impose capital punishment upon unethical merchants who used speculation, monopolies and hoarding to increase their personal profits at the expense of the poor. The Enrag√©s labeled price gouging as counter-revolutionary and treason. This sentiment extended to those who sympathized with the recently executed King Louis XVI. They felt that those who sympathized with the monarchy would also sympathize with those who hoarded goods. It is not surprising that many within the Enrag√©s actively worked against the Girondin faction and indeed they contributed to the demise of the moderate Girondins, who had fought to spare the king. Those who adhered to the ideologies presented in the Manifesto of the Enrag√©s wished to emphasize to the National Convention that tyranny was not just the product of monarchy and that injustice and oppression did not end with the execution of the king. In their view, oppression existed whenever one stratum of society sought to monopolize the majority of resources while simultaneous preventing others from gaining access to those same resources. In their view, the pursuit of resources was acceptable, but the act of limiting access to resources was punishable by death. The Enrag√©s called on the National Convention to restrict commerce that it might not \\"consist of ruining, rendering hopeless, or starving citizens\\". While the Enrag√©s occasionally worked within political structures, their primary objective was achieving social and economic reform. They were a direct action group, attempting to meet the immediate needs of the working poor.  Women in the Enrag√©s  Jean-Francois Varlet understood the enormous influence women possessed, particularly within the French Revolution. Varlet formed the Enrag√©s by provoking and motivating working poor women and organizing them into a semi-cohesive mobile unit. The Enrag√©s often appointed women as speakers to represent the movement in the National Convention. Revolutionary proto-feminists held vital positions within the Enrag√©s, including Claire Lacombe and Pauline L√©on. The proto-feminists of the French Revolution are credited with inspiring feminist movements in the 19th century.  Key leaders  ; Jacques Roux Jacques Roux, a Roman Catholic priest, was the leader of the Enrag√©s. Roux supported the common people and the Republic. He participated in peasant movements and endorsed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, to which he swore an oath on 16 January 1791. Roux claimed: \\"I am ready to give every last drop of my blood to a Revolution that has already altered the fate of the human race by making men equal among themselves as they are all for all eternity before God\\".Denis Richet, \\"Enrag√©s,\\" in Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution, ed. Fran√ßois Furet and Mona Ozouf (Harvard University Press, 1989), p. 338. Roux saw violence as a key to the French Revolution‚Äôs success and in fact when Louis XVI was executed it was Roux who led him to the scaffold.Denis Richet (1989). ed. Fran√ßois Furet and Mona Ozouf. \\"Enrag√©s\\". In Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution. Harvard University Press. p. 338. ; Jean Varlet Jean Varlet, another leader of the Enrag√©s, played a leading role in the fall of the monarchy. When Louis XVI attempted to flee Paris, Varlet circulated petitions in the National Assembly and spoke against the king. On 10 August 1792, the Legislative Assembly suspended the king and called for the election of a National Convention. Afterwards, Varlet became a deputy in the new National Convention. Even as a member of this representative government, Varlet mistrusted representation and favored direct universal suffrage which could bind representatives and recall elected legislators. He sought to prevent the wealthy from expanding their profits at the expense of the poor and called for the nationalization of all profits obtained through monopoly and hoarding.Denis Richet (1989). ed. Fran√ßois Furet and Mona Ozouf. \\"Enrag√©s\\". In Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution. Harvard University Press. pp. 337‚Äì338. ; Th√©ophile Leclerc In 1790, Th√©ophile Leclerc joined the first battalion of Morbihan volunteers and remained a member until February 1792. He gained recognition in Paris through a speech attacking Louis XVI to the Jacobins. After moving to Lyon, he joined the Central Club and married Pauline L√©on, a revolutionary woman. He approved of radical violence like the other Enrag√©s, calling for the execution of expelled Girondins after the 2 June insurrection.Denis Richet (1989). ed. Fran√ßois Furet and Mona Ozouf. \\"Enrag√©s\\". In Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution. Harvard University Press. p. 339. ; Claire Lacombe In 1793, the actress Claire Lacombe, another individual associated with the Enrag√©s, founded the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women. This group was outraged by high costs of living, the lack of necessities and awful living conditions. Lacombe was known for violent rhetoric and action. On 26 May 1793, Lacombe nearly beat to death a Girondin woman, Th√©roigne de M√©ricourt, with a whip on the benches of the Convention. She may have killed her if Jean-Paul Marat had not intervened.  Other groups  To the left of the Montagnards and H√©bertists, the Enrag√©s were fought against by Maximilien Robespierre and Jacques H√©bert, both of whom implemented some of their proposals in order to appeal to the sans-culottes and undermine the Enrag√©s influence. Their ideas were taken up and developed by Gracchus Babeuf and his associates. Another group styling itself as Enrag√©s emerged in France in 1968 among students at Nanterre University. Inspired by, and closely allied with, the Situationists, these Enrag√©s emerged as one of the leading groups in the May 1968 French insurrection.Ren√© Vi√©net (1992).

Biography Daniel S. Dickinson Born in Goshen, Connecticut, he moved with his parents to Guilford, Chenango County, New York, in 1806. He attended the common schools, was apprenticed to a clothier, and taught school at Wheatland, New York from 1821 on. In 1822, he married Lydia Knapp. He also engaged in land surveying, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1828. He commenced practice in Guilford, and served as Postmaster of Guilford from 1827 to 1832. He moved to Binghamton, New York and served as its first Village President in 1834. He was a member of the New York State Senate (6th D.) from 1837 to 1840, sitting in the 60th, 61st, 62nd and 63rd New York State Legislatures. He was Lieutenant Governor of New York from 1843 to 1844. In 1844, he was a presidential elector, voting for James K. Polk and George M. Dallas. In 1844 he was appointed as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Nathaniel P. Tallmadge, and was subsequently elected to a full term, holding office from November 30, 1844, to March 3, 1851. He was Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Finance (1849‚Äì1850), a member of the Committee on Manufactures (Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth United States Congresses), and a member of the Committee on Private Land Claims (Thirty-first United States Congress). As a senator and after, Dickinson was the leader of the conservative Hunker faction of the New York Democratic Party, and would eventually become leader of the \\"Hards\\" who opposed reconciliation with the more radical Barnburner faction which had left the party in 1848 to join the Free Soilers. Dickinson resumed the practice of law in 1851. He was delegate to the 1852 Democratic National Convention. In 1853, President Franklin Pierce appointed him as Collector of the Port of New York, but he declined to take office. In 1860, he supported John C. Breckinridge for President. He supported the Union during the American Civil War. He was elected New York State Attorney General in November 1861 on a ticket nominated by the Independent People's state convention (War Democrats), and endorsed by the Republicans. He was appointed United States Commissioner for the final settlement of the Hudson Bay and Puget Sound agricultural claims in 1864. Dickinson was considered as a possible vice presidential candidate when Abraham Lincoln ran for reelection in 1864 and desired a pro-war Democrat on the Republican ticket to demonstrate support for his war policy, but the nomination went to Andrew Johnson. Dickinson supported Lincoln's reelection, and was appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York in 1865, an office in which he served until his death. He died in New York City, and was buried at the Spring Forest Cemetery in Binghamton. Legacy Statue of Dickinson at the Broome County Courthouse Daniel S.

During his career, he played for clubs in the United States, Canada, and Norway. The 2006 Major League Soccer Goalkeeper of the Year award winner earned seven caps with the United States national team. Career =College and amateur= Perkins is a graduate of Thomas Worthington High School, in Worthington, OH, and played college soccer at the University of South Florida and the University of Evansville. He was named third-team All-Conference USA in 2001, and second-team All-CUSA in 2002. He transferred to Evansville for his senior season. At Evansville, he allowed only twenty-one goals in nineteen matches, compiling a 1.09 goals-against-average. Perkins also played in the PDL for the Cape Cod Crusaders in 2002. =Professional= Upon graduating in 2003, Perkins went undrafted. However, he was signed to a developmental contract by D.C. United. Not expected to contribute, Perkins was given an opportunity after both Nick Rimando and Doug Warren lost their starting positions. Perkins proved up to the task, and went on to start sixteen games for the team, posting a 1.62 goals against average. Although Perkins was performing well, the team suffered during his tenure, and he was replaced near the end of the season with Nick Rimando, who would also start for United throughout the playoffs. In early 2005 he trained with Bolton Wanderers F.C., an English Premier League club and in early 2006 he trained with Everton in Liverpool. During the 2006 season, Perkins was the starting goalkeeper for United, playing thirty of thirty-two games. He was also named 2006 MLS Goalkeeper of the Year, Best XI, and voted to the 2006 All Star Team. Perkins finished the 2007 MLS season with a 1.10 goals against average, eight shutouts, and sixteen wins, the most in the league. On December 20, 2007 Perkins signed a five-year contract with V√•lerenga, making him the first American to sign for the Norwegian club. On January 13, 2010, returned to D.C. United in a complicated pre-draft trade deal in which United traded midfielder Fred, its first-round 2010 MLS SuperDraft pick, its #6 spot in the MLS allocation order, and allocation money to Philadelphia Union in exchange for the Union's #1 spot in the allocation order. D.C. then used the #1 allocation ranking to re-acquire Perkins. Attempts were made to sign him by Feyenoord and several French clubs, but nothing materialised and he returned to D.C. United. On December 17, 2010, Perkins was traded to Portland Timbers for goalkeeper Steve Cronin and allocation money.http://www.portlandmls2011.com/news/2010/12/timbers-acquire- troy-perkins-dc-united Perkins went into camp as the Timbers' first choice goalkeeper, but he missed the first six Timbers games after a knee injury Perkins suffered in training. Despite the injury, Perkins notched the Timbers' first-ever league shutout with their 1‚Äì0 victory over Real Salt Lake on April 30, 2011. Perkins signed a new contract with Portland on November 28, 2011.Timbers re-sign goalkeeper Troy Perkins, defender David Horst  Portland Timbers Perkins began the 2012 season with the Timbers, however, on August 7, 2012, Perkins was traded to Montreal Impact for veteran Jamaican goaltender Donovan Ricketts. Perkins stayed with Montreal through the 2014 season. On January 13, 2015, Perkins signed with Seattle Sounders FC. On January 11, 2016, Perkins announced his retirement and joined the Seattle Sounders FC Academy as a staff member. =International= Perkins has also played for the United States National Team, receiving his first cap against Sweden on January 21, 2009. Personal life While being a backup goalkeeper for D.C. United, Perkins also had a second job working at a sporting goods store in Fair Lakes, VA called Galyans (which is currently known as Dick's Sporting Goods). Beginning in 2006, Perkins worked a second job as a mortgage loan processor, leading United fans to put up a banner that said, \\"Troy Saves ‚Äì and Loans.\\" Perkins has revealed that his return to MLS in 2010 was because his wife was unable to settle in Norway. Perkins considers that his training as a mortgage loan processor is important and has stated, \\"Goalies can usually play until they're around 40, so you have to think about a job after retirement,\\" He has an \\"austere pregame routine, which entails shutting off all electronics and not talking to anyone for 24 hours. 'I'm a miserable person to be around,' he says, laughing. 'My wife hates it.'\\" After retiring from professional soccer and leaving the Sounders organization, Perkins was sworn in as a police officer in Kennewick, Washington in January 2017. Honors =D.C.

In animals, these developmental genes specifically control the development of organs on their anteroposterior axis. In plants, however, the developmental genes affected by homeosis may control anything from the development of a stamen or petals to the development of chlorophyll. Homeosis may be caused by mutations in Hox genes, found in animals, or others such as the MADS-box family in plants. Homeosis is a characteristic that has helped insects become as successful and diverse as they are.Lodish et al., 2003. Molecular Cell Biology, 5th Edition. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York. Homeotic mutations work by changing segment identity during development. For example, the Ultrabithorax genotype gives a phenotype wherein metathoracic and first abdominal segments become mesothoracic segments. Another well-known example is Antennapedia: a gain-of- function allele causes legs to develop in the place of antennae. In botany, Rolf Sattler has revised the concept of homeosis (replacement) by his emphasis on partial homeosis in addition to complete homeosis; this revision is now widely accepted. Homeotic mutants in angiosperms are thought to be rare in the wild: in the annual plant Clarkia (Onagraceae), homeotic mutants are known where the petals are replaced by a second whorl of sepal-like organs, originating via a mutation governed by a single recessive gene. The absence of lethal or deleterious consequences in floral mutants resulting in distinct morphological expressions has been a factor in the evolution of Clarkia, and perhaps also in many other plant groups. Homeotic mechanisms in animals Following the work on homeotic mutants by Ed Lewis, the phenomenology of homeosis in animals was further elaborated by discovery of a conserved DNA binding sequence present in many homeotic proteins. Thus, the 60 amino acid DNA binding protein domain was named the homeodomain, while the 180 bp nucleotide sequence encoding it was named the homeobox. The homeobox gene clusters studied by Ed Lewis were named the Hox genes, although many more homeobox genes are encoded by animal genomes than those in the Hox gene clusters. The homeotic-function of certain proteins was first postulated to be that of a \\"selector\\" as proposed by Antonio Garcia-Bellido. By definition selectors were imagined to be (transcription factor) proteins that stably determined one of two possible cell fates for a cell and its cellular descendants in a tissue. While most animal homeotic functions are associated with homeobox-containing factors, not all homeotic proteins in animals are encoded by homeobox genes, and further not all homeobox genes are necessarily associated with homeotic functions or (mutant) phenotypes. The concept of homeotic selectors was further elaborated or at least qualified by Michael Akam in a so-called \\"post-selector gene\\" model that incorporated additional findings and \\"walked back\\" the \\"orthodoxy\\" of selector-dependent stable binary switches. The concept of tissue compartments is deeply intertwined with the selector model of homeosis because the selector-mediated maintenance of cell fate can be restricted into different organizational units of an animal's body plan. In this context, newer insights into homeotic mechanisms were found by Albert Erives and colleagues by focusing on enhancer DNAs that are co-targeted by homeotic selectors and different combinations of developmental signals. This work identifies a protein biochemical difference between the transcription factors that function as homeotic selectors versus the transcription factors that function as effectors of developmental signaling pathways, such as the Notch signaling pathway and the BMP signaling pathway. This work proposes that homeotic selectors function to \\"license\\" enhancer DNAs in a restricted tissue compartment so that the enhancers are enabled to read- out developmental signals, which are then integrated via polyglutamine- mediated aggregation. Homeotic mechanisms in plants Like the complex multicellularity seen in animals, the multicellularity of land plants is developmentally organized into tissue and organ units via transcription factor genes with homeotic effects. Although plants have homeobox-containing genes, plant homeotic factors tend to possess MADS-box DNA binding domains. Animal genomes also possess a small number MADS-box factors. Thus, in the independent evolution of multicellularity in plants and animals, different eukaryotic transcription factor families were co-opted to serve homeotic functions. MADS- domain factors have been proposed to function as co-factors to more specialized factors and thereby help to determine organ identity. This has been proposed to correspond more closely to the interpretation of animal homeotics outlined by Michael Akam.

The general objective is to negate or thwart the advantage gained by the enemy during attack, while the specific objectives typically seek to regain lost ground or destroy the attacking enemy (this may take the form of an opposing sports team or military units). A saying, attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte illustrate the tactical importance of the counterattack : \\"the greatest danger occurs at the moment of victory\\". In the same spirit, in his Battle Studies, Ardant du Pic noticed that \\"he, general or mere captain, who employs every one in the storming of a position can be sure of seeing it retaken by an organised counter-attack of four men and a corporal\\".Ardant du Picq, 'Battle Studies' A counterattack is a military tactic that occurs when one side successfully defends off the enemy‚Äôs attack and begins to push the enemy back with an attack of its own. In order to perform a successful counterattack, the defending side must quickly and decisively strike the enemy after defending, with the objective of shocking and overwhelming the enemy. The main concept of the counterattack is to catch the enemy by surprise. Many historical counterattacks were successful because the enemy was off guard and not expecting the counterattack.  Analyzing historical counterattacks  In the past, there have been many notable counterattacks which have changed the course of a war. To be specific, Operation Bagration and the Battle of Austerlitz are good examples of the proper execution of a counterattack. = Operation Bagration = This map shows the point of attack during Operation Bagration and how the counterattack was executed. Operation Bagration during World War II was one of the largest counterattacks in military history. In the summer of 1944 the assault by around 1.7 million Red Army soldiers successfully put the Red Army on the offensive in the Eastern Front after Nazi Germany in Operation Barbarossa had captured the territory against the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941. The Soviet counterattack focused on Belorussia, but prior to the counterattack starting, the Soviet Union fooled Nazi military leaders into believing that the attack will take place further south, near Ukraine. To aid the deception, the Red Army established fake army camps in the Ukraine and after German reconnaissance planes reported Soviet troop concentrations in the area, panzer and infantry divisions were rushed south from Belorussia, leaving it vulnerable to a major assault. To support the attack, partisan groups in German-controlled territory were instructed to destroy German railroads to hamper German efforts to transport supplies and troops throughout the occupied territories and further weaken German Army Group Centre in Ukraine. On June 22, 1944, the attack on Belarus by 1.7 million Soviet troops began and overwhelmed the depleted Germans defenders. On July 3, the Red Army captured Minsk and later liberated the rest of Belorussia. Operation Bagration was a huge Soviet success and opened a direct route to Berlin after the fall of Belorussia, leading to the Red Army beginning to liberate territory that was taken by the Wehrmacht three years before. = Battle of Austerlitz = Map depicting the famous counterattack that took place at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805. Another military battle that utilized the counterattack tactic was the Battle of Austerlitz on December 2, 1805. While fighting the Austrian and Russian armies, Napoleon purposely made it seem as if his men were weak from the fighting in several cases. Napoleon had his men retreat in an attempt to lure the Allies to battle. He purposely left his right flank open and vulnerable. This deceived the Allies into attacking and the Allies fell into Napoleon's trap. When the Allied troops went to attack Napoleon‚Äôs right flank, Napoleon quickly filled up the right flank so the attack was not effective. However, on the Allied side, a large gap was left open in the middle of the Allied front line due to troops leaving to attack the French right flank. Noticing the large hole in the middle of the Allied lines, Napoleon attacked the middle and had his forces also flank around both sides, eventually surrounding the Allies. With the Allies completely surrounded, the battle was over. The Battle of Austerlitz was a successful counterattack because the French army defended off the Allied attack and quickly defeated the Allies. Napoleon deceived the Allies. He made his men seem weak and near defeat. = Battle of St. Vith = The Battle of St. Vith was part of the Battle of the Bulge, which began on 16 December 1944, and represented the right flank in the advance of the German center, 5th Panzer-Armee (Armored Army), toward the ultimate objective of Antwerp. Given the task of countering the German advance, US General Bruce C. Clarke decided that a mobile defense was the best solution. Knowing that the German army was aiming for an objective far behind the battle line, he decided that they could afford to lose a few kilometers a day - the idea being that a slowing down of the advance was as good as stopping them outright, since the Germans were limited by time. The mobile defense he used at St. Vith involved the use of M36 tank destroyers acting as a base of fire to resist the oncoming German armored thrust, slowing them down enough to then counter-attack them with a force of M4 Sherman tanks. Artillery and Infantry were involved in this process as a combined arms force. The key was not to engage the Germans in a pitched battle, but to slow their advance enough to ruin their offensive timetable. The counter-attacks ensured that the German forces could not break through the slowly retreating forces. Clarke's success was one of the first times armor had been used in a mobile defense, and was one of the turning points of the war.

The \\"Last Post\\", scored in C The \\"Last Post\\" is either an A or a B‚ô≠ bugle call, primarily within British infantry and Australian infantry regiments, or a D or an E‚ô≠ cavalry trumpet call in British cavalry and Royal Regiment of Artillery (Royal Horse Artillery and Royal Artillery), and is used at Commonwealth military funerals, and ceremonies commemorating those who have been killed in war. Its duration varies typically from a little over one minute to nearly three minutes.The Last Post Association recording (see External Links) is 1 min 23 s; the Queen's Own Hussars version is 2 min 40 s For ceremonial use, the \\"Last Post\\" is often followed by \\"The Rouse\\", or less frequently the longer \\"Reveille\\". The two regimental traditions have separate music for the call.Trumpet & Bugle Calls for the British Army 1966 While the B‚ô≠ infantry bugle version is better known, the E‚ô≠ cavalry trumpet version is used by the state trumpeters of the Household Cavalry. Origin and wartime use The \\"First Post\\" call signals the start of the duty officer's inspection of a British Army camp's sentry posts, sounding a call at each one. The \\"Last Post\\" call originally signalled merely that the final sentry post had been inspected, and the camp was secure for the night. In addition to its normal garrison use, the \\"Last Post\\" call had another function at the close of a day of battle. It signalled to those who were still out and wounded or separated that the fighting was done, and to follow the sound of the call to find safety and rest. Its use in Remembrance Day ceremonies in Commonwealth nations has two generally unexpressed purposes: the first is an implied summoning of the spirits of the Fallen to the cenotaph, the second is to symbolically end the day, so that the period of silence before the \\"Rouse\\" is blown becomes in effect a ritualised night vigil. The \\"Last Post\\" as played at the end of inspection typically lasted for about 45 seconds; when played ceremonially with notes held for longer, pauses extended, and the expression mournful, typical duration could be 75 seconds or more. This custom dates from the 17th century or earlier. It originated with British troops stationed in the Netherlands, where it drew on an older Dutch custom, called taptoe, from which comes the term tattoo as in Military tattoo. The taptoe was also used to signal the end of the day, but originated from a signal that beer taps had to be shut, hence that the day had ended. It comes from the Dutch phrase Doe den tap toe, meaning \\"Close the tap\\". The Dutch bugle call Taptoesignaal, now used for remembrance events, is not the same tune as the \\"Last Post\\". The \\"Last Post\\" was used by British forces in North America in colonial times, but was replaced by the different \\"Taps\\" by the United States Army, first used in 1862 and officially recognized in 1874. Memorial usage Memorial stained glass window, Class of 1934, Royal Military College of Canada showing officer cadet playing the bugle call for the \\"Last Post\\" or \\"The Rouse\\". During the 19th century, the \\"Last Post\\" was also carried to the various countries of the British Empire. In all these countries, it has been incorporated into military funerals, where it is played as a final farewell, symbolising the fact that the duty of the dead soldier is over and that they can rest in peace. \\"Last Post\\" is used in public ceremonials commemorating the war dead, particularly on Remembrance Day in the Commonwealth of Nations. In Australia and New Zealand it is also played on Anzac Day, usually before the two-minute silence, which concludes with \\"The Rouse\\". When the post is played during services such as Anzac Day, it is required of all current serving military members to salute for the duration of the call. During services organised by the Royal British Legion, it is expected that no salute is given during the \\"Last Post\\" and Silence, as all personnel will have removed head dress as in church service prayer, have heads bowed, weapons inverted, and flags and standards lowered. In the Republic of Ireland, the \\"Last Post\\" as with the Commonwealth is played during memorial services, funerals and commemorations. The difference where the Irish are concerned is that the accompaniment of drums is incorporated into the performance. Menin Gate Last Post plaque, Menin Gate, Ypres, Belgium Special ceremony in Ypres for the centenary of the armistice. A version of the Last Post at the Menin Gate is played exceptionally at 11am Since 1928, the \\"Last Post\\" has been played every evening at 8 p.m. by buglers of the local Last Post Association at the war memorial at Ypres in Belgium known as the Menin Gate, commemorating the British Empire dead at the Battle of Ypres during the First World War. The only exception to this was during the four years of the German occupation of Ypres from 20 May 1940 to 6 September 1944, when the ceremony moved to Brookwood Cemetery in England. On the evening that Polish forces liberated Ypres, the ceremony was resumed at the Menin Gate, in spite of the heavy fighting still going on in other parts of the town. These buglers or trumpeters, sometimes seen in fire brigade uniform, are members of the fire brigade representing the Last Post Association, who organizes the events. The Last Post Association uses both silver B‚ô≠ bugles and E‚ô≠ cavalry trumpets, with either British Army tradition being respected during services at the gate. The Last Post ceremony has now been held more than 30,000 times. On 9 July 2015, a ceremony titled A tribute to the tribute took place to commemorate the 30,000th ceremony. Other uses The \\"Last Post\\" was incorporated into the finale of Robert Steadman's In Memoriam, a choral work on the subject of remembrance. It is also incorporated into Karl Jenkins's orchestral mass The Armed Man, and in the movement entitled Small Town, in Peter Sculthorpe's 1963 chamber orchestra work The Fifth Continent. A slightly altered version forms part of the slow movement of the Pastoral Symphony of Ralph Vaughan Williams and the ending of Mike Sammes' choral setting of Laurence Binyon's poem For the Fallen. Robert Graves's poem \\"The Last Post\\" describes a soldier's funeral during World War I. Ford Madox Ford used The Last Post as title for part of his tetralogy Parade's End. In 2015, Lee Kernaghan recorded a version for his album Spirit of the Anzacs. The Last Post is the title of a theatre play by David Owen Smith and Peter Came performed during Armistice Week at Lincoln Drill Hall, Lincoln in November 2014. The play concerns the Beechey family of Lincoln, UK. Amy Beechey had eight sons who all enlisted to fight during the First World War; only three of them survived. The bugle call is played during the final moments of the play. The play was directed by Janie Smith and performed by people of Lincoln.

There are more than 370 scheduled bus services, operated by SBS Transit, SMRT Buses, Tower Transit Singapore and Go-Ahead Singapore. The newest bus operator, Go-Ahead Singapore started operation on 4 September 2016. There are also around 5,800 buses currently in operation. History =Early history= A trolleybus in 1930s Singapore Buses were first introduced into Singapore when the Singapore Traction Company (STC) was established under the Singapore Traction Company Ordinance of 1925 to replace the ill-fated electric tramway with a trolleybus system. The first trolleybuses began operations on 14 August 1926 between Joo Chiat Road and Tanjong Pagar whereas trams were phased out by 1927, with 66 trolleybuses plying on six routes with a mileage of 15‚Äù by 30 September that year. The STC later phased in motorbuses in 1929 when seven Dennis G-type buses began plying between Geylang and Finlayson Green before being transferred to serve Seletar. However, the STC faced heavy competition from ‚Äúmosquito-buses‚Äù, a form of informal paratransit operated using privately owned modified Ford Model T vehicles. Reckless driving of such ‚Äúmosquito- buses‚Äù led to the government imposing heavy regulation on them, including having to stop at fixed stops (1923) and speed limits (1927). By 1935, ‚Äúmosquito-buses‚Äù were replaced with more formalised bus services with the former ‚Äúmosquito-bus‚Äù owners establishing what came to be known as the Chinese bus companies; these Chinese-operated buses connected the rural parts of Singapore to the town as opposed to the inner town services of the STC. During the Japanese Occupation during the Second World War, all bus operations were briefly unified under the , fuel shortages then led to some buses being charcoal-powered. =1950s-1960s: Post-war recovery and troubles= A Chinese- operated bus along Ayer Rajah Road in 1951 After the end of the war, the British Military Administration (BMA) was established to oversee the rebuilding of British institutions in its Malayan and Singapore colonies. Under the BMA, the STC slowly returned to normal operations with much of the dilapidated bus fleet replaced with newer motorbuses of the Albion make whereas the Chinese bus companies sought after numerous British makes such as Vulcan and Bedford. On the other hand, trolleybus operations were scaled down with only 50 new Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies-built trolleybuses procured as opposed the original 108 AEC-built trolleybuses from the pre-war period. Trolleybuses were eventually phased out by 1962 and were replaced by new Isuzu-built motorbuses. Unfortunately the 1950s boded bad times for both the STC and the Chinese bus companies. General discontent on the poor working conditions, coupled with a highly politicised environment in the 1950s, led to many of their workers joining labour unions such as the STC Employee's Union and the Singapore Bus Workers‚Äô Union (SBWU). Labour unrest led to transport paralysis, with two notorious incidents being the Hock Lee bus riots in 1955 (that year alone saw 57 strikes) and a 146-day-long Great STC Strike in 1956, the latter which further accelerated the decline of the STC when Chinese bus companies established their presence in the inner city with replacement bus services. Illegal ‚Äúpirate taxis‚Äù also flourished during this time, offering a form of relief for stranded commuters although they were also notorious for unsafe driving practices and cost the bus companies and legitimate taxi drivers much losses. The severity of the situation demanded immediate action from the government; in 1956 five Commissioners led by Mr L.C. Hawkins of the London Transport Executive published a report that recommended nationalisation of public transport but little was followed up by the government then. =1970s: Bus reorganisation and mergers= SBS began operating double-decker buses in 1977; by 2004 its successor SBS Transit was operating more than 700 of such buses, one of which was this Volvo Olympian Bus lanes was implemented in 1974 to speed up bus services Five years after the independence of Singapore from Malaysia in 1965, the government published a White Paper to study into an overhaul on bus services; this was followed by the Wilson Report published by Australian transport consultant R.P. Wilson, who not only reaffirmed the need for rationalisation of bus transport but also provided detailed recommendations on bus routes, frequencies, fares, vehicle specifications, bus stop and terminal design and maintenance standards. In April 1971, the 10 Chinese bus companies were merged to form three larger regional bus companies, namely Amalgamated Bus Company in the west, Associated Bus Services in the east and United Bus Company in the north. The STC retained their presence in central Singapore but lost their privileges previously granted by the 1925 STC Ordinance. Unable to cope with existing financial difficulties and competition from the regional companies, the STC eventually discontinued bus operations in 1971, with its remaining bus fleet being split up between the three regional companies. Service quality did not make great improvement however, with breakdowns and complaints from passengers being very common. Eventually in 1973, the Singapore government persuaded the three regional companies to merge to form a single entity called Singapore Bus Services (SBS). SBS inherited many problems from its Chinese predecessors, including use of 14 non-standard bus models that frequently broke down, poor standards among the staff and inadequate infrastructure. Hence, the government seconded a Government Team of Officials to SBS in 1974 to overhaul the management and culture. Under the supervision of the GTO, SBS completely overhauled their bus fleet with new buses of usually the Albion Viking VK or Mercedes-Benz OF1413 makes and introduced a rigorous maintenance regime, improving the reliability of their buses greatly whereas a new disciplinary code was introduced, reducing complaints by half from 1979 to 1983. The government also helped to further alleviate the burden from SBS by introducing priority bus lanes to speed up bus services and introduced Scheme B bus services operated by private companies in 1974. In 1977, SBS introduced into service its first double-decker buses, the Leyland Atlantean AN68 on route 86 between Tampines Way and Shenton Way. In light of dissatisfaction over bus services in the Jurong area and requests for improved coverage, SBS started a reorganisation of bus services across the country, starting with Jurong. This consisted of a network of internal services serving a town, with external services terminating at a point in the town, along with bus interchanges to serve as such termini. Additional depots were also constructed, which SBS claimed gave them more control over bus operations. In 1975, one-man operation (OMO) that charged a flat fare (for the case of SBS; TIBS opted for a distance fare) was introduced to cut manpower costs; this was followed by a one-man operated ticketing operation (OTS) in 1982. By 1984, bus conductors were completely phased out. By 1978, SBS was in a healthy position to be publicly listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange as SBS (1978) Limited. =1980s-1990s: Enter the new players= Whereas SBS opted for double-decker buses, TIBS went for articulated buses instead. This is a Hispano Carrocera-bodies Mercedes- Benz O405G By the 1980s, SBS had managed to modernise its fleet with new buses such as the Volvo B57, Mercedes-Benz OF1417 and the Leyland Atlantean AN68. By 1982 however, there was concerns that SBS might turn complacent. To ensure that SBS remain competitive, the government gave Mr Ng Ser Miang of Singapore Shuttle Bus (SSB, one of the two operators of City Shuttle Service) the green light to set up a second operator. Named as Trans-Island Bus Service (TIBS), TIBS started operations the following year with a modest fleet of 90 Hino buses on routes 160 and 167. By 1988, the company had expanded its operations to encompass Woodlands and Yishun and operated 328 buses on 214 routes and had taken over SSB. In 1984, SBS trialled its first air-conditioned buses, the Mercedes-Benz OF1413/61, on route 168. Following various trials of different air-conditioned demonstrators, SBS made its first bulk order for air- conditioned buses in 1989, in this case the Scania N113CRB. When the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) opened in 1987, bus services were further rationalised such that buses complemented the MRT by ‚Äúfeeding‚Äù commuters into the MRT network. Fares for both buses and the MRT were also coordinated together from 1987 with the setting of the Public Transport Council that year whereas magnetic stored value cards were implemented across the entire bus network to streamline fare payment earlier in 1986. In 1993, SBS introduced into service its first air-conditioned 12m double decker bus, the Leyland Olympian 3-axle. With a capacity of 131, its size earned it the nickname the ‚ÄúSuperbus‚Äù. Three years later, TIBS phased in Singapore's first articulated buses with a length of 17.5m and a capacity of 150. =Late 1990s-2000s: Bus operators go multimodal= An EZ-Link card reader on board an SMRT bus. EZ-Link contactless smart cards were first introduced in 2002 Toa Payoh Bus Interchange was the first air-conditioned bus interchange in Singapore By 1996, SBS had expanded far beyond public bus operations to include tourist transport (SBS Leisure), taxis (Citycab) and engineering works (SBS Engineering) to name a few. To better manage its business, SBS (1978) Limited was rebranded as DelGro Corporation while public bus services were now managed by a new subsidiary named SBS. This new company also won a tender in 1999 to operate the North East MRT Line and the LRT systems in Sengkang and Punggol and was rebranded as SBS Transit in 2001 to reflect its multimodal nature. By 2003, Delgro Corporation merged with Comfort Group to form ComfortDelGro, one of the largest land transport operators in the world whose operations include Metroline in London and ComfortDelGro Australia. In 2001, TIBS was merged into SMRT Corporation and by 2004, the TIBS name was dropped by SMRT, with TIBS now being known as SMRT Buses. During this period, there were also numerous changes outside corporate shakeups; in 1995, some bus services in Sengkang and Punggol were transferred to TIBS from SBS but this was reversed in 1999 when SBS won the contract to operate the North East MRT Line. In return, bus services in Bukit Panjang, Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok were transferred to TIBS that year. In 2002, the contactless EZ-Link card was introduced to replace the magnetic farecard and the first air-conditioned bus interchange opened in Toa Payoh; by the end of 2019, there will be 11 air-conditioned integrated transport hubs (ITH). In 2006, SBS Transit introduced into service its first wheelchair accessible bus, the Volvo B9TL, on route 21 between Pasir Ris and St. Michael's. SSB wound up in 2007 with the discontinuation of the City Shuttle Service and its fleet was inherited by SMRT Buses. By 2009, both SBS Transit and SMRT Buses were renewing their respective bus fleets with new low-entry Scania K230UB buses and Mercedes-Benz OC500LE buses respectively. It was also in the 21st century when the public bus operators looked into alternative fuel sources. In 2002, SBS purchased 12 CNG-powered Volvo B10BLE buses whereas the first hybrid buses and hydrogen fuel cell buses were introduced in 2010. =2010s: Government leans in= Under the new Bus Contracting Model, all new public buses are to be painted in a unified lush green livery Since the early years of independence, the government has maintained its stance that heavy car usage is not sustainable for Singapore in the long term with a mixed use of policies to both deter car usage and to push its people to take public transport. Public transport in Singapore has unfortunately felt the strain from an increasing population; in December 2011, the North South MRT Line suffered its first major breakdowns with 127,000 passengers affected in the worst of them. Amid growing criticism of the existing operating model and growing strain on the bus system, the main public transport statutory board Land Transport Authority (LTA) launched the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP), with 80 new bus routes and 1000 government-funded buses, involving Volvo B9TL, Mercedes-Benz Citaro, Alexander Dennis Enviro500 and MAN NL323F (A22)) buses. introduced over a period of five years. In 2013, the last non air-conditioned public bus, the Volvo Olympian 2-axle, was phased out of service whereas SMRT Buses introduced its first wheelchair accessible articulated bus, the MAN NG363F A24 and in the following year, its first ever double decker bus, the Alexander Dennis Enviro500. In 2014, LTA announced that it would replace the existing operating model with the Bus Contracting Model (BCM) from 2016 onwards. Modelled after the Transperth model with elements of the competitive tendering model from London Buses, LTA would own all bus assets and lease them out in regional packages to different bus operators for five years. The first bus package, the Bulim Bus Package, was awarded to Anglo-Australian company Tower Transit whereas Loyang was awarded to Go-Ahead. Both companies began their operations in 2016. The entire public bus system was fully transitioned into the BCM by September 2016 with SBS Transit and SMRT signing agreements with LTA to operate the remaining packages up to 2021 to 2026 after which they would be gradually opened up to competitive tendering.Annex B: Details of the 11 Negotiated Packages. Land Transport Authority. Retrieved 14 January 2017. Under the BCM, new buses with new features were also introduced; in 2016 the first fully electric bus since the withdrawal of trolleybuses, the BYD K9A, was operated by Go-Ahead Singapore whereas the first buses with USB charging ports commenced service with SMRT that year. In 2017, two three-door buses ‚Äî a double deck MAN ND323F and a single deck MAN NL323F were trialled by Tower Transit and SMRT Buses respectively. New Volvo B5LH hybrid buses were also purchased from Volvo in 2018. On 17 December 2018, LTA started a 6-month trial of on-demand public bus (ODPB) services. It allows commuters to request for on-demand bus services within the Marina-Downtown and Joo Koon areas during off-peak hours on weekdays, and those heading from the CBD to Bedok or Tampines in late-night hours. During the trial, regular bus services serving the areas specified will still be available, though at lower frequencies. However, the trial wasn't successful and was eventually discontinued after 15 June 2019. As a result, Services 400 and 402, both plying within the Marina-Downtown areas were merged and NightRider Service NR7, plying between the CBD and Bedok/Tampines estates on Fridays, Saturdays & Eves of Public Holidays in late-night hours was also permanently discontinued. In April 2019, SimplyGo, a new payment scheme that allows direct fare payment from bank cards, was introduced. Stroller restraint systems were also retrofitted on all wheelchair-accessible buses from July 2019 onward. In addition, LTA also experimented with assistive technology for commuters with special needs on routes 139 and 141 from January to July 2019. =2020s: In with electric buses, out with non-wheelchair-accessible buses= In March 2020, the Mercedes-Benz Citaro Hybrid debuted on SBS Transit route 272. On 3 April 2020, 10 units of the Yutong E12 electric buses debuted on SMRT services 944 and 983, on Tower Transit services 66 and 990, and on Go- Ahead service 15. LTA is expected to introduce new electric buses of the Yutong E12DD, ST Engineering-Linkker and BYD K9 makes as well as new 3-door double decker buses by 2020. All the Volvo Super Olympian buses were retired from revenue services on 8 April 2020, but 2 buses have been preserved for heritage use (1 in Hong Kong and 1 in Singapore) with the exception of SBS9889U being in revenue service. Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on bus services With the COVID-19 pandemic emerging across the world in 2020, the Singapore government introduced circuit breaker (lockdown) measures to curb the spread of the virus responsible for COVID-19. Under these measures, selected public bus services were suspended in 2 tranches, with adjustments made later. The first tranche of suspended bus services took effect from Wednesday, 8 April 2020, while the second tranche of bus service suspensions started from Wednesday, 15 April 2020. The suspensions lasted till Monday, 1 June 2020, when most bus services (excluding recreational-oriented bus services such as late night services and Chinatown Direct) were resumed at pre-circuit breaker levels. During the circuit breaker (partial lockdown) period, social distancing measures were also implemented on public transport through demarcating areas to stand and seats not to sit on with stickers. Since 14 April 2020, wearing of masks is made compulsory whenever outside home, with the exception of dining in and exercising. Currently, you are allowed to gather up to five persons in a group and social distancing of 1m is being done between groups. Social distancing stickers were removed to allow gatherings of up to 5 people. Vehicles Singapore's buses consist of single deck and double deck buses and they are operated by all four operators, SBS Transit, SMRT Buses, Tower Transit Singapore and Go-Ahead Singapore. Articulated buses are operated by SMRT Buses, with several units being transferred to SBS Transit's Seletar Bus Package under the Bus Contracting Model (BCM).  Abuse of bus staff  The abuse of bus staff has led to buses requiring protective screens since 2016, not just during the period of COVID-19 pandemic.

History In March 1907, the executive of the German Union of Municipal and State Workers, based in Berlin, issued a call to \\"workers employed in municipal and state undertakings, in power stations, in gas and waterworks, in all countries\\" to attend an international conference in August, 1907, in Stuttgart. Four Danes, two Dutchmen, eight Germans, a Hungarian, a Swede and a Swiss met in the Stuttgart trade union building for the First Congress of Public Services International, representing 44,479 workers, and they founded the International Secretariat of the Workers in Public Services. This grew rapidly, and by 1913 represented more than 100,000 workers, enabling a part-time salary to be paid to the secretary, based in Berlin. The federation ceased to operate during World War I, but was reactivated in 1919, now based in Amsterdam. In 1925, it renamed itself as the International Federation of Employees in Public Services, while in 1935 it absorbed the International Federation of Civil Servants, becoming the International Federation of Employees in Public and Civil Services. The headquarters moved back to Berlin in 1929, then to Amsterdam in 1933, and on to Paris. This closed in 1940, and the occupying Nazi forces destroyed the federation's property, but in 1945 the federation was relaunched at a meeting of the executive committee, held in London. The following year, it became known as the International Federation of Unions of Employees in Public and Civil Services, then in 1958 it shortened its name to become the \\"Public Services International\\".

Using the authentic script taken from the only surviving transcript recorded during the meeting, the film delves into the psychology of Nazi officials involved in the \\"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\\" during World War II. The film was written by Loring Mandel and directed by Frank Pierson. Its ensemble cast includes Colin Firth, David Threlfall, Kenneth Branagh as Reinhard Heydrich, and Stanley Tucci as Adolf Eichmann. Branagh won an Emmy Award for Best Actor, and Tucci was awarded a Golden Globe for his supporting role. Plot On 20 January 1942, as Nazi Germany's war effort sours due to the failure of Operation Barbarossa, the entrance of the United States into World War II, and the death of Walther von Reichenau, a meeting is held to determine the method by which the government is to implement Adolf Hitler's policy, that the German sphere of influence should be free of Jews, including those in the occupied territories of Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Czechoslovakia and France. As the film opens, various officials from different German agencies arrive and mingle at a lakeside villa in the Berlin borough of Wannsee. Among those present: *Wilhelm Stuckart (Colin Firth), a lawyer representing the Interior Ministry and co-author of the anti-Semitic Nuremberg Laws *Friedrich Wilhelm Kritzinger (David Threlfall), deputy head of the Reich Chancellery *Gerhard Klopfer (Ian McNeice), a Falstaffian lawyer from the Nazi Party Chancellery *Otto Hofmann (Nicholas Woodeson), Chief of the SS Race and Settlement Main Office *Martin Luther (Kevin McNally), the obsequious Foreign Ministry's liaison to the SS. *Heinrich M√ºller (Brendan Coyle), Gestapo chief and Adolf Eichmann's immediate superior *Josef B√ºhler (Ben Daniels), State Secretary for the General Government of occupied Poland *Rudolf Lange (Barnaby Kay), a Sicherheitsdienst (SD) Commander *Alfred Meyer (Brian Pettifer), Deputy Reich Minister, Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories *Erich Neumann (Jonathan Coy), the apparently out-ranked Director of the Office of the Four Year Plan *Reinhard Heydrich (Kenneth Branagh), Heinrich Himmler's right-hand man in the SS, who begins by explaining the purpose of the meeting. It is quickly established by those present that there is a significant \\"Jewish problem\\", in that the Jews of Europe cannot be efficiently contained, nor can they be forced onto other countries. Kritzinger interrupts at several points to say that the meeting is pointless, given that the Jewish Question had previously been settled, but Heydrich promises to revisit his concerns. Heydrich announces that the government's policy will change from emigration from German-held territories to \\"evacuation\\" to the Occupied Eastern Territories, and that Fascist Italy will be forced to cooperate. As the squalor at the camps and ghettos for Jews, including Theresienstadt, becomes apparent to the attendees, there is consternation over the use of euphemisms from the SS members, including Meyer, who want to adopt an open policy of genocide. A discussion follows of the possibilities of sterilisation, and of the exemptions for mixed race Jews who have one or more non-Jewish grandparents. At this point, Stuckart loses his temper and insists that a sturdy legal framework is paramount, and that ad hoc application of standards will lead to administrative chaos. He also chides Klopfer for his simplistic portrayal of Jews as subhuman beasts, simultaneously painting his own picture of Jews as clever, manipulative and untrustworthy. Heydrich calls a break in the proceedings, and after praising Stuckart aloud takes him aside to warn him about the consequences of his stubbornness, implying that others in the SS will take an unwanted interest in his actions. When the meeting reconvenes, Heydrich steers the discussion in the direction of wholesale extermination using gas chambers. This causes consternation among some attendees, especially Kritzinger and B√ºhler. Kritzinger objects on the grounds that Hitler had given him personal guarantees that extermination of the Jews was not being considered. B√ºhler is shocked to discover that the SS have been building extermination camps at Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka, and making preparations for the \\"Final Solution\\" under his nose. It eventually becomes clear to everyone at the meeting that they have been called together not to discuss the problem but to be given orders by the SS, who are intent on wresting control of the operation from other agencies such as the Interior Ministry and the Reich Chancellery. Eichmann now describes the method that will be used: the gassing of Jews. Many have already been killed in specially designed trucks and his figures include tens of thousands of victims. Eichmann explains that permanent gas chambers will be built at locations such as Auschwitz. He even describes their bodies as coming out \\"pink\\" (a symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning), at which point Hofmann is suddenly taken ill. He later attributes this to a bad cigar. Throughout the meeting and over refreshments attendees raise other side issues, reflecting the interests of their respective work areas. Lange warns that executing Jews by shooting has a deleterious effect on the morale of his troops, and he clashes with Luther's indifference. Klopfer requests that the Party retains some discretionary power over the process. B√ºhler presses for urgency, concerned that typhus could break out from the overpopulated ghettos in Poland. Meyer and Neumann do not want production stymied due to disruption or the loss of skilled workers. Heydrich admonishes Hofmann over his insistence that his office takes the lead in managing resettlement in Hungary. A break is called and this time it is Kritzinger's turn to be taken aside and intimidated by Heydrich, who warns that Kritzinger is influential but not invulnerable. Heydrich tells Kritzinger that he wants not only consent but active support, and Kritzinger realises that any hopes he had of assuring livable conditions for the Jewish population are unrealistic. In return, he tells Heydrich a cautionary tale about a man consumed by hatred of his father, so much so that his life loses its meaning once his father dies. Heydrich later interprets this as a warning that a similar fate awaits them if they allow their lives to revolve around antisemitism. Heydrich then recalls and concludes the meeting, giving clear directives that the SS are to be obeyed in all matters relating to the elimination of the Jews. He also asks for explicit assent and support from each official, one by one. After giving careful instructions on the secrecy of the minutes and notes of the meeting, they are adjourned and begin to depart. As the servants at the villa tidy away the remains of the meeting, and the officials depart, a brief account of the fate of each one is given. Most of the members either died during the war or were acquitted by Allied military tribunals to live a peaceful life in postwar West Germany. Heydrich would be assassinated by Czechoslovak partisans for his brutal rule in Bohemia and Moravia within several weeks, while Eichmann would flee to Buenos Aires but be captured and sentenced to death by Israel in the 1960s. The film ends with the house tidied up and all records of the meeting destroyed as if it had never happened. The final card before the credits reveals that Luther's copy of the Wannsee minutes, recovered by the US Army in the archives of the German Foreign Office in 1947, was the only record of the conference to survive.

Her builders went bankrupt shortly after she was laid down, which significantly delayed her completion. After being launched in 1863, she waited a further five years to receive her guns due to supply issues. Upon being commissioned in 1868 the ship was assigned as the First Reserve guard ship for Southern Ireland, where she remained until she was decommissioned in 1885. Valiant was hulked in 1897 as part of the stoker training school HMS Indus before becoming a storeship for kite balloons during the First World War. The ship was converted to a floating oil tank in 1926 and served in that role until sold for scrap in 1956. Design and description The Hector-class ironclads,Ironclad is the all-encompassing term for armored warships of this period. Armoured frigates were basically designed for the same role as traditional wooden frigates, but this later changed as the size and expense of these ships forced them to be used in the line of battle. like their immediate predecessors, the , were designed as smaller and cheaper versions of the armoured frigates.

While handy in manoeuvring, they rolled quite badly.Parkes, p. 33 =Propulsion= Valiant had one 2-cylinder horizontal return connecting rod steam engine made by Maudslay Sons & Field driving a single propeller. Six boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of . The engine produced a total of . During sea trials on 18 September 1865 Valiant had a maximum speed of . The ship carried of coal,Ballard, pp. 246‚Äì47 enough to steam at full speed.Parkes, p. 30 The ship was barque-rigged and had a sail area of . Her funnel was semi-retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail alone. She was designed to allow the ship's propeller to be hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag while under sail, but the hoisting gear was never fitted.Ballard, p. 158 =Armament= The armament of the Hector-class ships was intended to be 32 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 15 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck. This was modified during construction to eight rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns and twenty-four 68-pounders. The breech-loading guns were a new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863‚Äì64 caused the navy to withdraw the gun from service shortly afterwards.Parkes, p. 32 Due to her extended construction time, Valiant never received the breech loaders, and was armed with sixteen and two rifled muzzle-loading guns. The two 8-inch guns were mounted on the quarterdeck where they could be fought in all weathers and four 7-inch guns were also fitted on the upper deck. The remaining twelve 7-inch guns were carried on the main deck.Ballard, pp. 156‚Äì57 The shell of the 15-calibre 8-inch gun weighed while the gun itself weighed . It had a muzzle velocity of and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal of wrought iron armour at the muzzle. The 16-calibre 7-inch gun weighed and fired a shell. It was credited with the nominal ability to penetrate armour.Gardiner, p. 6 =Armour= The Hector-class ships had a wrought iron waterline armour belt, thick, that covered amidships and left the bow and stern unprotected. To protect against raking fire the belt was closed off by 4.5-inch transverse bulkheads at each end at lower deck level. The armour extended to below the waterline. The main deck was protected by a strake of armour that ran the full length of the ship. Amidships, it was 4.5-inch thick for a length of 216 feet and tapered to a thickness of to the ends of the ship. The armour was backed by of teak. The lack of armour at the stern meant that the steering gear was very vulnerable.Ballard, pp. 165, 244 Service history HMS Valiant was laid down 1 February 1861 by Westwood, Baillie in Cubitt Town.Ballard, p. 240 This company went bankrupt in November 1861 and was ultimately bought by Thames Ironworks, which delayed the ship's launching until 14 October 1863. In August 1865, after Valiant had been towed to Portsmouth for fitting out, the ship was inspected by French officers during a port visit by ironclads of the French Navy.Jones, p. 37 Production of the new muzzle-loaded rifles was slow and ships already in commission had priority so Valiant was not commissioned until September 1868, nearly five years after she was launched.Ballard, p. 159 After Valiant was commissioned she became the First Reserve guard ship in Southern Ireland, where she remained until 1885, an experience unique among the British ironclads, although she did have one break to have new boilers installed. From June to August 1878 the ship formed part of the Particular Service Squadron at the time of the Russian war scare during the Russo-Turkish War, and sailed up the Dardanelles under the command of Admiral Hornby. On 20 July 1884 Valiant was accidentally rammed by the ironclad in Lough Swilly, damaging her hull and tearing off her boats, davits and fittings on one side of the ship. Valiant was paid off in 1885, and saw no further front-line service; lying for thirteen years in a partially dismantled state at Devonport. In 1897 she was assigned to the stoker training establishment , briefly losing her name, before being renamed as Indus IV in 1904.Ballard, p. 161 The ship was converted to a kite balloon storeship in 1915, during World War I, and her name was changed to HMS Valiant III. She was offered for sale in 1922, but there were no takers so that she was converted into a floating oil tank in 1926 and towed to Hamoaze, where she remained until 1956. Valiant was sold in that year to Belgian ship breakers and towed to Bruges on 8 December 1956.

Minotaur took nearly four years between her launching and commissioning because she was used for evaluations of her armament and different sailing rigs. The ship spent the bulk of her active career as flagship of the Channel Squadron, including during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee Fleet Review in 1887. She became a training ship in 1893 and was then hulked in 1905 when she became part of the training school at Harwich.

The armament of the Minotaur-class ships was intended to be 40 rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns on the main deck and 10 more on the upper deck on pivot mounts. The gun was a new design from Armstrong, but proved a failure a few years after its introduction. The gun was withdrawn before any were received by any of the Minotaur-class ships. They were armed, instead, with a mix of and rifled muzzle-loading guns. All four nine-inch and 20 seven-inch guns were mounted on the main deck while four seven-inch guns were fitted on the upper deck as chase guns.

He was also regent of Castile (1406‚Äì1416). Biography Born in Medina del Campo, he was the younger son of King John I of Castile and Eleanor of Aragon. On 15 August 1403 in Medina del Campo, Ferdinand founded a new order of knighthood, the Order of the Jar. In 1406, upon the death of his elder brother, King Henry III of Castile, Ferdinand declined the Castilian crown and instead, with Henry's widow Catherine of Lancaster, became coregent during the minority of his nephew John II of Castile. In this capacity he distinguished himself by his prudent administration of domestic affairs. In a war with the Muslim Kingdom of Granada, he conquered the town of Antequera (1410), whence his surname. After Ferdinand's maternal uncle, King Martin I of Aragon (Martin II of Sicily), died without surviving legitimate issue, Ferdinand was chosen King of Aragon in 1412 to succeed him in the Compromise of Caspe. The other candidate, Count James II of Urgell (see Counts of Urgell), revolted and Ferdinand dissolved the County of Urgell in 1413. Ferdinand created the title of Prince of Girona for the heir of the Crown of Aragon on 19 February 1416. The most notable accomplishment of his brief reign was his agreement in 1416 to depose the Antipope Benedict XIII, thereby helping to end the Western Schism, which had divided the Roman Catholic Church for nearly 40 years. He is buried in the Aragonese royal pantheon of the monastery of Poblet, in a magnificent tomb ordered by his son Alfonso to Pere Oller in 1417. The Italian humanist Lorenzo Valla wrote an official biography of Ferdinand, Historiarum Ferdinandi regis Aragonum libri sex. Family and children In 1393 Ferdinand married Eleanor of Alburquerque (1374‚Äì1435). They had seven children: * Alfonso V of Aragon (1396‚Äì1458), king of Aragon, Sicily and Naples, married Maria of Castile * Maria of Aragon, (1403‚Äì1445), queen of Castile, first wife of John II of Castile * John II of Aragon (1398‚Äì1479) * Henry of Aragon (c. 1400-1445), duke of Villena, count of Alburquerque and Empuries, lord of Sogorb, etc. and grand master of the military Order of Santiago, married Catherine of Castile * Eleanor of Aragon, (1402‚Äì1445), queen of Portugal, who married Edward I of Portugal * Peter of Aragon (1406‚Äì1438), count of Alburquerque and duke of Noto * Sancho of Aragon (1410‚Äì1416), grand master of the Orders of Calatrava and Alc√°ntara Appearance and character \\"He was tall, a little more than average, and thin and ruddy, and his cheeks had a few freckles... very patient to all who wanted to talk to him, even if their speeches were ordinary or not well-reasoned...\\"From Cr√≥nica de Juan II by Alvar Garc√≠a de Santa Mar√≠a Genealogy References =Bibliography=  * * Further reading *T.

The main product to come out of ARC was the revolutionary oN-Line System, better known by its abbreviation, NLS. ARC is also known for the invention of the \\"computer mouse\\" pointing device, and its role in the early formation of the Internet. Engelbart recruited workers and ran the organization until the late 1970s when the project was commercialized and sold to Tymshare, which was eventually purchased by McDonnell Douglas. Beginnings Some early ideas by Douglas Engelbart were developed in 1959 funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (now Rome Laboratory). By 1962, a framework document was published. J. C. R. Licklider, the first director of the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), funded the project in early 1963. First experiments were done trying to connect a display at SRI to the massive one- of-a-kind AN/FSQ-32 computer at the System Development Corporation in Santa Monica, California. NASA funding NASA began to provide major funding at the behest of Robert Taylor in 1964. A custom graphical workstation was built around a commercial computer, the CDC 160A, and a CDC 3100, which handled a single user at a time. In 1965, Taylor became IPTO director, leading to increased funding. In 1968 an SDS 940 computer running the Berkeley Timesharing System allowed multiple users. The project was first called ARNAS after the sponsors. For a few years it was then called the Augmented Human Intellect Research Center, which got shortened to the Augmentation Research Center around 1969. The Mother of All Demos During a 90-minute session at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, Engelbart, Bill English, Jeff Rulifson and other ARC staffers presented their work in a live demonstration, including real-time video conferencing and interactive editing in an era when batch processing was still the paradigm for using computers. This was later called \\"the Mother of All Demos\\". Reference library service Engelbart had volunteered ARC to provide the first reference library service on the ARPANET while it was being designed. The first message sent on ARPANET was between the ARC computer and UCLA. Larry Roberts continued to fund the ARC through DARPA IPTO until he left in 1974. The library service evolved into the Internet Network Information Center managed by Elizabeth J. Feinler. Bertram Raphael was put in charge of the project in 1976. Sale to Tymshare The technology was sold to Tymshare in 1977, with 20 members of the former SRI group (including Engelbart) becoming Tymshare employees. Only about three or four people were left to continue the NIC, although this group grew quickly along with the Internet. Jon Postel left in 1977 to join the Information Sciences Institute. A number of early participants moved on to careers at Xerox, Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems, and other leading computer companies. Tymshare renamed the software Augment and offered it as a commercial service via its new Office Automation Division. At Tymshare, Engelbart soon found himself marginalized and relegated to obscurity. Operational concerns at Tymshare overrode Engelbart's desire to do further research. Various executives, first at Tymshare and later at McDonnell Douglas, which acquired Tymshare in 1984, expressed interest in his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to further develop them. His interest inside of McDonnell Douglas was focused on the enormous knowledge management and IT requirements involved in the life cycle of an aerospace program, which served to strengthen Engelbart's resolve to motivate the information technology arena toward global interoperability and an open hyperdocument system. Engelbart retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1986, determined to pursue his work free from commercial pressure. Books about ARC The complex story of the rise and fall of ARC has been documented in a book by sociologist Thierry Bardini. From the perspective of the 1960s counter-culture revolution, John Markoff, in his book What the Dormouse Said, also follows Englebart's persistence in creating ARC as not only a collection of talented off-beat engineers working in direct contrast to the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory nearby, but also as a sociological experiment that constructed and tested methods for group creation and design. ARC was also indirectly covered in many other books about Xerox PARC, since that is where many ARC employees later fled to (and brought some of Engelbart's ideas with them). Taylor had founded the Computer Systems Laboratory at PARC in 1970.

It was, for most of its existence, the TA infantry in the counties of Hampshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and the Isle of Wight. History Members of the former B Company on exercise The regiment was formed on 1 July 1999 by the amalgamation of elements of the 6th/7th (Volunteer) Battalion, The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, 2nd (Volunteer) Battalion, The Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment and the 5th (Volunteer) Battalion, The Royal Green Jackets due to the reforms of the Territorial Army implemented following the Strategic Defence Review. It was the infantry component of 145 (Home Counties) Brigade. Its companies during its eight-year existence were: *HQ Company in Berkshire - 1999-2007 *A (Royal Green Jackets) Company in Oxfordshire - 1999-2007 *B (Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire) Company in Berkshire - 1999-2006 (amalgamated into HQ Company, keeping its rifle platoon in Swindon, Wiltshire) *C (Duke of Connaught's) Company in Hampshire - 1999-2005 (became D Company, 3rd Battalion, Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, minus its rifle platoon based on the Isle of Wight) *E (Royal Green Jackets) Company in Buckinghamshire - 1999-2007 *F (Royal Green Jackets) Company in London - 2006-2007 *G (Royal Green Jackets) Company in London - 2006-2007 In 2002 the Royal Rifle Volunteers took part in a major NATO \\"Partnership for Peace\\" exercise in the Ukraine codenamed Exercise COSSACK EXPRESS. In 2003 the Royal Rifle Volunteers took part in a major NATO exercise in Lithuania codenamed Exercise AMBER HOPE. A formed platoon was also deployed to Afghanistan as part of Op FINGAL. Some soldiers from E (RGJ) Coy also deployed to Bize, Albania in support of the Royal Welsh Regiment's \\"Partnership for Peace\\" exercise codenamed ALBANIAN EXPRESS. In 2005 a formed company (Roebuck company) from the RRV, along with a platoon attachment from the 3rd Battalion Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment was dispatched to Iraq which was part of the Multi-National Division (South East) as part of Op TELIC.  A mixed cap badge battalion  The RRV consisted of sub-units that all had their own regimental affiliations. Soldiers of the RRV would work together in this multi-cap badge battalion. The unit would have to come up with innovative methods of mixing the light drill of RGJ companies and the heavy drill of the PWRR and RGBW companies.  Mobilisations  The regiment's four mobilisations were: *Platoon(+) - Operation FINGAL *Platoon to Eden Company - Operation Telic 3 *Company (-) as Roebuck Company - Operation Telic 6 *Platoon (-) as Salamanca Platoon Force Protection - Operation Herrick 4 & 5 Afghanistan 2003 The 2003 Operation FINGAL deployment saw a platoon(+) of RRV personnel join with a platoon(-) from the East of England Regiment. These in turn then formed 4 and 5 platoons of A company the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment (the poachers). The two platoons were noteworthy due to their performance in pre-deployment training and acceptance onto the A company ORBAT. The platoons worked well throughout their tour as part of the Kabul Patrols Company. Roles and responsibilities included:left- Patrolling of police districts 8 and 9 in the NE and SE of Kabul. \\\\- Quick Reaction Force duties in Kabul. \\\\- Detached duties at Bagram Airbase. \\\\- Force Protection of Camp Souter. \\\\- Reserve and surge operations at behest of COMBRITFOR. 44 soldiers from the RRV were deployed, 2 Officers, 2 SNCOs and 40 JNCOs/ORs. The deployment received much acclaim as it highlighted the interoperability of the regular and reserve forces, with the TA soldiers assuming most of the duties of their regular counterparts. Iraq 2003/04 - Operation Telic 3 The 2004 Operation TELIC 3 deployment again saw a Platoon of RRV personnel join a platoon (+) of the East of England Regiment. These two platoons plus a number of individual reinforcements from 200 signals squadron and permanent staff formed a company(-) group, later named Eden company. The company took responsibility for the security of Basra palace its immediate AOR, media operations escorts, river patrols on the Shatt Al-Arab waterway and formed a reserve for the brigade. 2004 CIA Map of Iraq Reorganisation & later Amalgamation with other units On 24 November 2005, the MOD announced a reorganisation of the army, and it was planned that the RRV would become 4th Battalion, Royal Green Jackets, and the PWRR company (C) would be reassigned to 3 PWRR as D company and its Isle of Wight platoon rerolled to a Royal Logistics Corps unit. However, at a later date the Light Division decided to amalgamate the Light Infantry and Royal Green Jackets. The RRV became their 7th Battalion on formation of the new regiment, 1 February 2007. Currently, the RRV is now 7th Battalion the Rifles. D company 3 PWRR, (formerly C Coy RRV) has now rerolled into No. 679 (The Duke of Connaught's) Squadron Army Air Corps. Commanding officers The four commanding officers were: *Lt Col Mike Motum, RGBW - 1999-2001 *Lt Col \\"Roddy\\" Windsor, RGJ - 2001-2003 *Lt Col Mike Scott, PWRR - 2003-2006 *Lt Col Damian Griffin, TD, RRV - 2006-2007 (became CO 7th Bn, The Rifles) References Further reading * Category:Infantry regiments of the British Army Category:The Rifles Category:Army Reserve (United Kingdom) ","title":"Royal Rifle Volunteers"},{"id":"1159527","text":"KC Accidental were a Canadian post-rock band from Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Its unique design became a cultural icon and is fondly remembered by many who grew up in that period. The design was influenced by dragsters, \\"chopped\\" motorcycles, beach buggys, and even chariots, as can be seen on the centre page of the 1969 Raleigh US catalogue. Design The Raleigh Chopper's design has been a constant debate, with claims by both Tom Karen of Ogle Design and Alan Oakley of Raleigh. The Chopper was designed in response to the Schwinn Sting-Ray, and an earlier attempt, called the Rodeo, which was not commercially successful. The popularity of the Chopper also led to a range of smaller bikes following a similar design theme. These included the Raleigh Chipper, Tomahawk and Budgie models, aimed at younger riders.  History  = Mk 1 = Raleigh Chopper Mk1 The Chopper's patent was applied for in the US in 1967. The Chopper was introduced at American trade shows in January 1969 but it was not until April 1969 when Raleigh Choppers were available for public to purchase. The bike featured a choice of a single-speed coaster hub, or a 3-speed or 5-speed Sturmey Archer gear hub, selected using a frame-mounted console gear lever. Other features that appealed to the youth market were the unusual frame, long padded high-back seat, sprung seat at the back, high-rise (ape hanger) handlebars, 'bobbed' mudguards (fenders) and differently sized wheels: front and rear. The rear hoop above the seat resembled a dragster anti roll bar \\"sissy bar\\". Even the kickstand was designed to give the stationary bicycle a lean reminiscent of a parked motorcycle. Tyres were wider than usual for the time, with a chunky tread on the rear wheel, featuring a red line around the sidewall. In 1969 the Raleigh Chopper was launched in the UK market this was a triple launch for Raleigh, with the Chopper branded as THE HoT oNE, alongside the Moulton Mk3 (The Smooth One), and the RSW Mk3 (The Dolly One). The Chopper bike was sold as a \\"must have\\" item and signifier of \\"coolness\\" for many children at the time. = Mk 2 = The Mk 2 (\\"Mark 2\\") Chopper was an improved version sold from 1972. It had the rarely-purchased option of five-speed derailleur gears, and the gear lever shifter changed from a knob to a T-bar-style shifter. (The early 1969 'Tall frame' model already sported the T-bar style, albeit in black with the elliptical window within the shifter cover.) The frame was subtly revised, and the seat moved forward, to help prevent the front of the bicycle tipping up. A small rear rack was added. The handlebars were welded to the stem to stop children from inclining the \\"ape hanger\\" bars backward, thereby rendering the bicycle almost unsteerable. A drop-handlebar version, the Sprint, was also produced, this differed from the standard Mk 2, as it had a slightly taller frame. The Chopper Mk 2 remained in production until 1980, by which time the BMX craze had taken over its market. However, the Chopper almost single- handedly rescued Raleigh, which had been in decline during the 1960s, selling millions worldwide. = Handling and safety = The original Chopper is fondly remembered, though it was not without problems: It was less stable than a conventional bicycle and trickier to ride. The Chopper was not suitable for cycling long distances as it was slow and heavy, the wide tires creating significant rolling resistance. At moderate speeds it suffered speed wobbles. After several reported accidents, it was attacked in the press as a dangerous toy. The long seat lent itself to giving lifts to others, and accidents were not uncommon. It could perform involuntary wheelies readily, again a frequent cause of accidents. The position of the gear lever could also contribute to injuries sustained in a crash. Original models UK market * MK1 - available only as a 3 speed model, Brilliant Orange, Golden Yellow, Flamboyant Green, Targa Mustard (HBR model), and Horizon Blue. * Sprint GT - available in either Bronze or Flamboyant Green. * MK2 - standard 3 speed models available in Infra Red, Ultra Violet, Fizzy Lemon, Quick Silver, Space Blue, and Jet Black (Prismatic decal model). * MK2 - Pink 5 Speed (Derailleur), Mk2 Lime Green 5 Speed(Derailleur). * MK2 - SE with cast alloy mags to commemorate 750,000 choppers US market The North American market had a much wider spectrum of models and colours available. In 1971 there was a ban on tall sissy bars so the chopper was only sold with a low back rest. A summary of models: * MK1 1969 'Tall Frames'; available as a single speed coaster (SC), 3 speed (AW - three speed and TCW - three speed coaster), and 5 speed (S5 - 3+2). * MK1 1970-1972 available as a single speed coaster (SC), 3 speed (AW - three speed and TCW/S3C - three speed coasters) 5 speed (S5 - 3+2) 5 speed and 10 speed (derallieur). The single and three speed models were also available as a Girl‚Äôs model without crossbar. * MK2 available as a 3 speed (AW) and 5 speed (S5 - 3+2). The Eatons connectionThe Glider Fastback 100 version was sold by Eatons of Canada The Raleigh Chopper was also sold through Eaton's in Canada, badged as Gliders, and sold as the Fastback 100, Fastback XT101, SS357, ULT, Princess and MACH-2 models. Worldwide sales Raleigh sold the Chopper to many countries worldwide. In some countries Raleigh chose to sell Choppers with alternative brands. These included BSA, Hercules, Humber, Malvern Star, Phillips, Robin Hood, Rudge and Speedwell Fireballs. = Imitators = The success of the Chopper led to similarly styled imitators, such as the Pavemaster Trusty Tracker, Triang Dragster, Dawes Zipper, Panther and Vindec High Riser in the UK as well as the very close copy of an Mk 2 named \\"Cincoa\\" and in more recent years the Ground Cruiser which was sold in the UK at the same time as the release of the MK 3.  Revival: Mk 3,4,5 A new version of the Chopper, the Mk 3, was launched in February 2004 firstly in red then purple, the Chopper having being out of production for almost 25 years. The Mk3, in deference to modern safety concerns, adopts a more conventional saddle design to discourage \\"backies\\", and has dropped the groin-catching gear lever in favour of handlebar mounted gear controls; to commemorate this former feature the Mk 3 has a sticker where the lever once was located. The frame is made from aluminium alloy tubing, rather than the originals' steel, to make the bicycle lighter. The wheels are again 20 inches for the back wheel and 16 for the front wheel. The MK3 remained in production until 2009 when it was replaced by the slightly changed mk4 model. Since then there have been multiple editions of the Chopper - the Beano edition, JPS, Hot One and Mod. Instead of the 3 speed Sturmey Archer hubs they changed to 6 speed shimano derailleur gears. All these were considered mk5, production of which ended in summer 2018.

These include pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, sepsis, urinary tract infections, and Lyme disease. It is used by mouth or by injection into a vein or muscle. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, allergic reactions, and pain at the site of injection. Serious side effects may include Clostridium difficile infection, anaphylaxis, and Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is believed to be safe. It is a second-generation cephalosporin and works by interfering with a bacteria's ability to make a cell wall resulting in its death. Cefuroxime was patented in 1971, and approved for medical use in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2017, it was the 342nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800 thousand prescriptions. Medical uses As with the other cephalosporins, it is susceptible to beta- lactamase, although as a second-generation variety, it is less so. Hence, it may have greater activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Lyme disease. Unlike other second-generation cephalosporins, cefuroxime can cross the blood-brain barrier. A systematic review found high quality evidence that injecting the eye with cefuroxime after cataract surgery will lower the chance of developing endophthalmitis after surgery. Side effects Cefuroxime is generally well tolerated, and its side effects are usually transient. If ingested after food, this antibiotic is both better absorbed and less likely to cause its most common side effects of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headaches/migraines, dizziness, and abdominal pain compared to most antibiotics in its class. Although a widely stated cross-allergic risk of about 10% exists between cephalosporins and penicillin, recent assessments have shown no increased risk for a cross-allergic reaction for cefuroxime and several other second-generation or later cephalosporins. Chemistry Cefuroxime axetil is an acetoxyethyl ester prodrug of cefuroxime which is effective when taken by mouth. It is a second-generation cephalosporin. Trade names In the U.S. it is marketed as Zinacef by Covis Pharmaceuticals since the company acquired the U.S. rights to the product from GSK.http://www.covispharma.ch/assets/pdf/covis-pharma-acquires-portfolio-of- drugs-from-glaxosmithkline.pdf GSK had continued marketing a pediatric oral suspension as Ceftin; however, this presentation was discontinued as of 24 June 2017. In Bangladesh, it is available as Rofurox by Radiant, Kilbac by Incepta and Xorimax by Sandoz. In India, it is available as Ceftum in tablet form and Supacef in injection form by GSK. In Poland, it is available as Zamur by Mepha, subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. In Australia, the \\"first generic\\" form of Cefuroxime axetil, Pharmacor Cefuroxime (tablets) from Pharmacor Pty Ltd, was registered on 27 March 2017, by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Cefuroxime axetil is also available (in two strengths) as granules for oral suspension from Aspen Pharmacare Australia Pty Ltd under the brand name Zinnat cefuroxime.

In Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' own critique of political economy, it refers to the combination of the means of labor (tools, machinery, land, infrastructure, and so on) with human labour power. Marx and Engels probably derived the concept from Adam Smith's reference to the \\"productive powers of labour\\" (see e.g. chapter 8 of The Wealth of Nations(1776) ), although the German political economist Friedrich List also mentions the concept of \\"productive powers\\" in The National System of Political Economy (1841). All those forces which are applied by people in the production process (body and brain, tools and techniques, materials, resources, quality of workers' cooperation, and equipment) are encompassed by this concept, including those management and engineering functions technically indispensable for production (as contrasted with social control functions). Human knowledge can also be a productive force. Together with the social and technical relations of production, the productive forces constitute a historically specific mode of production.  Labor  Karl Marx emphasized that with few exceptions means of labour are not a productive force unless they are actually operated, maintained and conserved by living human labour. Without applying living human labour, their physical condition and value would deteriorate, depreciate, or be destroyed (an example would be a ghost town or capital depreciation due to strike action). Capital itself, being one of the factors of production, comes to be viewed in capitalist society as a productive force in its own right, independent from labour, a subject with \\"a life of its own\\". Indeed, Marx sees the essence of what he calls \\"the capital relation\\" as being summarised by the circumstance that \\"capital buys labour\\", i.e. the power of property ownership to command human energy and labour-time, and thus of inanimate \\"things\\" to exert an autonomous power over people. What disappears from view is that the power of capital depends in the last instance on human cooperation. The productive power of cooperation comes to be viewed as the productive power of capital, because it is capital which forcibly organises people, rather than people organising capital. Marx regarded this as a supreme reification. Unlike British classical economics, Marxian economics classifies financial capital as being an element of the relations of production, rather than the factors or forces of production (\\"not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things\\").Marx, Karl. Das Kapital, Vol. I, Ch. 33, courtesy of www.marxists.org.  Destructive forces  Marx and Engels did not believe that human history featured a continuous growth of the productive forces. Rather, the development of the productive forces was characterised by social conflicts. Some productive forces destroyed other productive forces, sometimes productive techniques were lost or destroyed, and sometimes productive forces could be turned into destructive forces:  Marxist‚ÄìLeninist definition in the Soviet Union  The Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., textbook (1957, p xiv) says that \\"[t]he productive forces reflect the relationship of people to the objects and forces of nature used for the production of material wealth.\\" (italics added) While productive forces are a human activity, the concept of productive forces includes the concept that technology mediates the human-nature relationship. Productive forces do not include the subject of labor (the raw materials or materials from nature being worked on). Productive forces are not the same thing as the means of production. Marx identified three components of production: human labor, subject of labor, and means of labor (1967, p 174). Productive forces are the union of human labor and the means of labor; means of production are the union of the subject of labor and the means of labor. (Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., 1957, p xiii). On the other hand, The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1969-1978) states: According to this, productive forces have such structure: * People (human labour power) * Means (the material elements of the productive forces) ** Means of production *** Means of labour **** Instruments of labour *** Objects of labour (also known as Subject of labour) ** Means of consumption Marxism in USSR served as core philosophical paradigm or platform, and had been developing as a science. So different views, hypotheses and approaches were widely discussed, tested and refined with time.  Determinism  :See article: Theory of productive forces  Reification of technology  Other interpretations, sometimes influenced by postmodernism and the concept of commodity fetishism have by contrast emphasized the reification of the powers of technology, said to occur by the separation of technique from the producers, and by falsely imputing human powers to technology as autonomous force, the effect being a perspective of inevitable and unstoppable technological progress operating beyond any human control, and impervious to human choices. In turn, this is said to have the effect of naturalising and legitimating social arrangements produced by people, by asserting that they are technically inevitable. The error here seems to be that social relations between people are confused and conflated with technical relations between people and things, and object relations between things; but this error is said to be a spontaneous result of the operation of a universal market and the process of commercialization.  Productivity  Marx's concept of productive forces also has some relevance for discussions in economics about the meaning and measurement of productivity. Modern economics theorises productivity in terms of the marginal product of the factors of production. Marx theorises productivity within the capitalist mode of production in terms of the social and technical relations of production, with the concept of the organic composition of capital and the value product. He suggests there is no completely neutral view of productivity possible; how productivity is defined depends on the values and interests people have. Thus, different social classes have different notions of productivity reflecting their own station in life, and giving rise to different notions of productive and unproductive labour.  Critique of technology  In the Romantic or ecological critique of technology, technical progress boosting productivity often does not mean human progress at all. The design of production technologies may not be suited to human needs or human health, or technologies may be used in ways which do more harm than good. In that case, productive forces are transformed into destructive forces. Sometimes this view leads to cultural pessimism or a theory of \\"Small is beautiful\\" as proposed by E. F. Schumacher. Ideas about alternative technology are also proposed. All of this suggests that the technologies we have, are only options which have been chosen from different technical possibilities existing at the time, and that the same technologies can be used for good or for ill, in different contexts. A technology may be chosen because it is profitable, and once adopted on a mass scale, it may be difficult to create alternatives to it, particularly because it becomes integrated with other technologies and a whole \\"life style\\" (e.g. petrol- fueled cars). Yet that may not mean that the technology is ultimately desirable for human life on earth. Productive force determinism is then criticised on the ground that whatever technologies are adopted, these are the result of human choices between technical alternatives, influenced by the human interests and stakes existing at the time. What may be presented as a pre-determined \\"technical necessity\\" may in reality have more to do with considerations of political, sociological, or economic power. Advocates of technological progress however argue that even if admittedly \\"progress may have its price\\", without technical innovation there would be no progress at all; the same people who criticize technology also depend on it for their everyday existence.

The hermaphrodite flowers are pollinated by bees. As a perennial, this plant reproduces itself over many years, spreading out from the point it was introduced, especially in damp grassy areas. This plant has been propagated in the past as animal fodder. Lathyrus pratensis is also a host plant for ovipositioning of the wood white butterfly (Leptidea sinapis).Clarke, S. A.; Green, D.

Description Meadow vetchling is a perennial plant with a limp, unwinged stem that grows to and is erect and hairy. The leaves are alternate with short stalks and large stipules. The leaf blades are pinnate with a single pair of broad lanceolate leaflets with blunt tips, entire margins and a terminal unbranched tendril. The inflorescence has a long stem and a cluster of five to twelve yellow flowers, each long. These have five sepals and five petals and are irregular. The uppermost petal is known as the \\"standard\\", the lateral two as the \\"wings\\" and the lowest two are joined to form the \\"keel\\". There are ten stamens and a single carpel. The fruit is a long black pod. This plant flowers from June to August.

There is a hypothesis or theory that states that over long periods of time, the displacement on any segment must be equal to that experienced by all the other parts of the fault.McCann, W.R., Nishenko, S.P., Sykes, I.R. & Krause, J. 1979. Seismic gaps and plate tectonics: seismic potential for major boundaries. Pure and applied geophysics, 117, 1082‚Äì1147 Any large and longstanding gap is, therefore, considered to be the fault segment most likely to suffer future earthquakes. The applicability of this approach has been criticised by some seismologists although earthquakes sometimes have occurred in previously-identified seismic gaps.

He was born in 1837 in Delmar, Maryland and died in 1907 in the City of Baltimore, Maryland. He is buried at the Parsons Cemetery in Salisbury, Maryland, the county seat of Wicomico County.National Governors Association, Governor's Information, Maryland Governor Elihu Emory Jackson He was part owner of Pemberton Hall, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Governor Jackson is also known as having attended the ceremonies at Gettysburg Battlefield in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania from the largest military battle on the North American continent in July 1863, dedicating several regimental and battle monuments for engagements participated in by the Union Army (United States Army), and even visiting some already erected and privately funded Confederate States Army monuments, and showing equanimity towards both sides with several regiments of Maryland troops in both armies, including regiments from the former pre-war State Militia. During the ceremonies and travels through the battlefield areas, he and his staff carried a revived Maryland state flag incorporating the shield from the coats-of-arms of the old colonial proprietary family of the Calverts and Crosslands, with both the black/gold chevrons of the paternal Calvert family and the red/white colors of the split bottony crosses (trefoil) of the maternal Crossland family. The ancestral parents of the first Lord Baltimore, Sir George Calvert, (1579‚Äì1632), the first Baron Baltimore (Lord Baltimore) who originally received the granting charter in 1632 from King Charles I of England for the new third English colony and Province of Maryland, which after his sudden death, was transferred to his eldest son and heir, Cecilius Calvert, [1605-1675], (the second Baron Baltimore and Lord Baltimore) who then became the first Lord Proprietor of the Colony while still living in England. It was he who sent the first two ships (the \\"Ark\\" and the \\"Dove\\") to the shores of the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay with colonists who first briefly visited Virginia further south, then landed in March 1634, established the new capital St. Mary's City, under his younger brother Leonard Calvert, (1606‚Äì1647), as the first colonial governor. By the end of the 19th century, carrying the old colonial armorial bearings from the shield emblazoned on a newly revived state flag, now seemed symbolic of the revival of reconciliation and sense of moving forward in the state so deeply torn asunder during the recent Civil War. There are several photographs of the Governor and his staff arrayed in front of several of the Maryland military monuments at Gettysburg, dressed in military uniforms and with the new state flag prominently posted alongside. It was officially adopted in 1904 as the state flag by act of the General Assembly of Maryland in the historic 18th-century Maryland State House in the later state capital of Annapolis. In his 2005 biography of poet Ogden Nash, Douglas M. Parker has written that \\"Elihu Emory Jackson . . . made a sizable fortune in the lumber business.\\" The family, wrote Parker, were \\"Southern Methodists and Southern sympathizers.\\" Jackson's granddaughter, Frances Leonard, was wed to Nash from 1931 to his death in 1971.

Although she was commissioned late in the war and spent only one year in the Pacific war zone, she was able to run up a record of 88,091 tons in 21 ships and numerous trawlers sunk. The first Spadefish was laid down on 27 May 1943 by the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, Calif.; launched on 8 January 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Mildred Florence Scanland (n√©e Boyd), wife of Commodore Francis W. Scanland; and commissioned on 9 March 1944, Commander Gordon W. Underwood in command. First war patrol, July ‚Äì September 1944 Following shakedown training along the coast of California, Spadefish departed San Francisco on 14 June and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 22 June. On 23 July, she got underway from Pearl Harbor for her maiden war patrol, as a member of a coordinated attack group with and . On 19 August, while patrolling in Philippine waters off the northwest coast of Luzon, Spadefish torpedoed and sank her first enemy target the 9,589-ton, passenger-cargo ship Tamatsu Maru. Three days later, she trailed three large tankers through Babuyan Channel along the northern Luzon coast; closed range; and fired two spreads of torpedoes, sinking the 10,023-ton tanker Hakko Maru No. 2, and damaging a second tanker that, protected by a destroyer, limped back to a shallow cove off Luzon. For several hours into the next day, Spadefish attempted to get around the escort to attack the damaged ship anchored in the cove. The submarine finally let go with four stern torpedoes at the destroyer, but the enemy zigged clear and proceeded to depth charge the entire area. Having only three torpedoes remaining, Spadefish set course for Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, to replenish her supply. On 8 September, Spadefish was patrolling in waters of Nansei Shoto when she contacted a convoy of eight cargo ships. During a daring night surface attack, she fired a total of 20 torpedoes, sinking cargo ships Nichiman Maru, Nichian Maru, Shinten Maru, and Shokei Maru and damaging another. The following morning, she fired her final four torpedoes at an escort guarding the stricken ship; but they ran under the target. The submarine's only reward on this occasion was a rain of depth charges. Although she was out of torpedoes, Spadefish continued to trail the remaining ships of the convoy that first took refuge in the harbor of Ishigaki; and then, in company with five escorts, continued their voyage. Spadefish terminated her first war patrol at Pearl Harbor on 24 September, having sunk six enemy ships for a total of over 31,500 tons. With the additional 33,000 tons sunk by her sister submarines, the coordinated attack group accounted for a total of 13 ships and over 64,000 tons of enemy shipping. Second war patrol, October ‚Äì December 1944 In the Yellow Sea in November 1944 Spadefish sank the 1902 cargo ship Daiboshi Maru No. 6. This photo shows her as the British ship Gracchus, which was her name until Japanese owners bought her in 1923. Spadefish did not rest on her laurels. On 23 October, she got underway from Pearl Harbor for her second war patrol, in a coordinated attack group with and . While patrolling in the Yellow Sea on 14 November, she torpedoed and sank the Japanese cargo ship . Three days later, she contacted an enemy convoy headed directly at her. After letting the convoy pass overhead, she surfaced after darkness had set in and commenced an ‚Äúend around.‚Äù She first fired six torpedoes at the prime target, the 21,000-ton escort aircraft carrier ; and then turned rapidly to port and fired four stern torpedoes at a tanker. The unarmored fuel tanks of the escort carrier Shinyo exploded and started a huge fire that destroyed the ship and killed most of her crew. Only 70 men from her crew of 1,200 officers and men survived. Damage to the tanker could not be confirmed. Later that same night, Spadefish drove in for another attack, firing four stern torpedoes at Submarine Chaser No. 156. As the enemy disappeared in the resulting explosion, the submarine quickly evaded other escorts and left the vicinity. Spadefish sank the fourth ship of her second patrol on 29 November by torpedoing the 3,760-ton cargo ship Daiboshi Maru No. 6; and then concluded her patrol at Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 12 December. Third war patrol, January ‚Äì February 1945 After spending the holidays at Majuro, Spadefish departed on 6 January 1945 for her third war patrol, conducted with , , and in the Yellow Sea. On 28 January, she intercepted an enemy convoy and let go with two spreads of torpedoes. The 7,158-ton converted seaplane tender Sanuki Maru, exploded and quickly sank, and the frigate Kume, spouted flames and began slowly to sink. Three enemy escorts pounced on Spadefish, but the submarine made her escape and continued her patrol. Spadefish added to her score on 4 February by sinking the passenger-cargo ship Tairai Maru. Two days later, only five miles from Port Arthur, she blasted the 1,092-ton passenger-cargo ship Shohei Maru, to the bottom. An enemy patrol airplane dropped a depth charge in the vicinity of the submarine; but, although she was rocked by the shock waves, Spadefish was unharmed and returned to Guam on 13 February. Fourth war patrol, March ‚Äì April 1945 On 15 March, Spadefish departed Guam for her fourth war patrol, conducted in the East China and Yellow Seas. On 23 March, the submarine sneaked past four escorts and let go with three torpedoes that sank the 2,274-ton cargo ship Doryo Maru. Spadefish patrolled along the coast of Ky≈´sh≈´, continuing north to Tsushima Strait, where she carried out reconnaissance to determine the presence of minefields. She demolished an enemy schooner off the coast of Korea on 1 April and gave the same treatment to a three-masted junk on 7 April. Two days later, she sank the cargo ship Lee Tung; and, on 11 April, damaged a minesweeper. She terminated her fourth patrol at Guam on 21 April. Fifth war patrol, June ‚Äì July 1945 USS Spadefishs battle flag Equipped with a new mine-detecting device, she began her fifth war patrol, joining eight other United States submarines in penetrating through the minefields of Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan. On 10 June, outside the breakwater of Tarukawa Wharf, Spadefish overtook the outbound passenger-cargo ship Daigen Maru No. 2, and blew the enemy ship apart with two torpedo hits. Before the day was over, the submarine had also sunk the passenger-cargo ships Unkai Maru No. 8 and Jintsu Maru. Before dawn on 12 June, Spadefish sank a motor sampan with 20 mm fire; and, later in the day, sank three trawlers in gunfire attacks. On 13 June SS-411 sank the Soviet merchant ship Transbalt in a friendly fire incident. On 14 June, she sank the passenger-cargo ship Seizan Maru; and, in a night attack on 17 June, she sank the C.M. minelayer Eij≈ç Maru. She then rejoined the other submarines and exited the Sea of Japan, returning to Pearl Harbor on 4 July. Spadefish was preparing for another war patrol when hostilities with Japan ended. She remained at Pearl Harbor until 2 September and then set course for Mare Island Naval Shipyard where she was decommissioned on 3 May 1946 and was placed in reserve. She was reclassified an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-411, on 6 November 1962, was struck from the Navy List on 1 April 1967, and sold for scrap in 1969. Spadefish (SS-411) received four battle stars for World War II service. In popular culture Spadefish is one of several submarines (along with the era's USS Tang, Bowfin, Growler, and Seawolf) whose war patrols can be re- enacted in the 1985 MicroProse computer game Silent Service and the game's various ports, including Konami's 1989 release for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

He ruled jointly with his elder brother Duke Albert II. Life Otto was born in the Austrian capital Vienna, the youngest son of King Albert I of Germany and Elizabeth of Carinthia, a member of the House of Gorizia-Tyrol (Meinhardiner). His elder brothers were Rudolf III, who became King of Bohemia in 1306, Frederick the Fair, elected King of the Romans in opposition to Louis the Bavarian in 1314, the Austrian dukes Leopold I and Albert II as well as Henry the Friendly. After the murder of King Albert I in 1308, the Habsburgs lost out in the struggle around the German throne, when Frederick the Fair was defeated by his Wittelsbach rival Louis in the 1322 Battle of M√ºhldorf. In the course of a rapprochement of both dynasties, Otto married Elizabeth of Wittelsbach, a daughter of Duke Stephen I of Bavaria. In 1327 he founded Neuberg Abbey in Styria, on the occasion of the birth of his first son Frederick II, and the Chapel of Saint George in the Augustinian Church in Vienna. When his wife Elizabeth died in 1330, she was buried at the Neuberg Abbey church. From 1329 onwards, Otto administrated the original Habsburg possessions in Swabia (Further Austria). In 1330, he and his brother Albert II were enfeoffed with the Austrian duchy. Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor since 1328, also vested Otto with the title of an Imperial vicar. In February he developed close ties with the mighty House of Luxembourg by secondly marrying Anna of Bohemia, daughter of King John the blind and sister of future emperor Charles IV, in the Moravian royal city of Znojmo. Two months later, Otto's maternal uncle, the Meinhardiner duke Henry of Carinthia died without male heirs, whereupon Emperor Louis IV on 2 May 1335 ceded the Duchy of Carinthia, the adjacent March of Carniola and the southern part of the Tyrol to Otto and Albrecht as Imperial fiefs in Linz. Otto was enthroned as duke in accordance with the archaic Carantanian rite on the Zollfeld plain, and, from that time onwards, took care of Carinthia rather than of the Austrian duchy. In 1337 he founded the knightly order Societas Templois for the crusade against the pagan Prussian and Lithuanian tribes. His nickname the Merry refers to the festive life at his court. Otto died at Neuberg Abbey at the age of 37. His sons and titular successors Frederick II and Leopold II died shortly afterwards in 1344 (presumably poisoned), and the line became extinct. Marriages and children Duke Otto and his two sons, Neuberg Abbey On 15 May 1325, Otto married his first wife Elizabeth of Bavaria. She was a daughter of Stephen I, Duke of Bavaria and Jutta of Schweidnitz. They had two children: *Frederick II (10 February 1327 ‚Äì 11 December 1344) *Leopold II, Duke of Austria (1328 ‚Äì 10 August 1344) Elizabeth of Bavaria died on 25 March 1330. Otto remained a widower for almost five years. On 16 February 1335, Otto married his second wife Anna of Luxembourg, daughter of King John of Bohemia and his first wife Elizabeth, a member of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty. They would have no children. Anna died on 3 September 1338. Otto had four illegitimate sons who appear in genealogies. The identities of their mother or mothers and their later fates are unknown: *Otto *Leopold *Johann *Leopold.

High school and college Stokes attended high school at C.D. Hylton High School in Woodbridge, Virginia where he won back to back Virginia AAA state championships. His high school team received a #1 national ranking in 1998. Stokes played club soccer for the Braddock Road Youth Club where he won 3 Virginia State Cups and a USYSA National Championship in 1999. Stokes also won an indoor National Championship with Braddock Road. He then played three years of college soccer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 2000 to 2002. As a sophomore, Stokes was named Defensive MVP of the College Cup as he helped UNC to a national championship. Professional After finishing his junior season, Stokes signed a Project-40 contract with MLS. Hailed as the second-coming of Eddie Pope, Stokes was selected 5th overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by D.C. United. Although Stokes' athleticism was clear, he did not receive the opportunity to play in regular season action during his rookie year. He did appear in U.S. Open Cup games for United, friendly matches (including a win against Blackburn Rovers) and made appearances on loan with the Virginia Beach Mariners.April 23, 2003 USL Press Release After Ray Hudson was released, many expected Stokes to play a larger role in Peter Nowak's team. Stokes had a promising beginning to the 2005 season in which he saw action in the CONCACAF champions cup and began the MLS regular season in the starting eleven. A concussion sidelined Stokes in the early part of his campaign. After recovering from this, he had another setback after he suffered a harsh tackle resulting in cartilage damage in his left ankle. The injury required surgery and ended Stokes' '05 season. Stokes worked hard to recover earlier than expected and arrived fit to play in the '06 preseason, but 2 quadriceps tears sidelined Stokes once again until the late summer. Stokes worked his way back into the first team after reserve team appearances but did not receive much playing time in his last season with DC. After his tenure with DC, Stokes overcame his injuries and signed with the Carolina Railhawks. He was able to return to school and continue to play as well. Stokes helped Carolina to back to back Southern Derby Cup championships and plans on graduating from UNC in the summer of 2009. Olympic team Stokes played for the United States under-23 men's national soccer team in the qualification rounds, notching the game winning assist in the group phase play vs. Honduras which locked the team into first place going into the semi-final. This talented group failed to qualify, however, after losing to Mexico in Mexico in front of their crowd of 60,000+.

Life Feodor Chaliapin Sr. and Iola Tornagi, 1890‚Äì1900 Chaliapin was the son and namesake of the great operatic bass Feodor Chaliapin. He was born in Moscow, Russia, and had a distinguished career in acting throughout Europe, mainly in Italy. His mother was Iola Tornagi, a ballerina who abandoned a promising ballet career to care for Feodor and his five siblings. When the Russian Revolution occurred in October 1917, the Chaliapins attempted to continue living in Russia, but this became impossible, especially after the Bolsheviks reputedly confiscated his father's property. Along with many other Russian √©migr√©s, part of the family immigrated to Paris in 1924, via Finland. The senior Chaliapin used this as his world base, like other emigres and members of their families who often ended up living in the United States such as Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Rachmaninoff and, for a while, Sergei Prokofiev. Chaliapin grew up in a family who spoke three languages. He received an excellent education in Moscow and lived there until 1924, when he immigrated to Paris to be with his father, leaving behind his mother and the rest of the family. Chaliapin knew some of the greatest composers and conductors of the 20th century, particularly Rachmaninoff, a personal family friend and teacher of his father. Tired of living in his father's shadow in Paris, Chaliapin struck out on his own, moving to Hollywood to begin his film career ‚Äî first in silent movies, in which his then-heavy accent would not be heard in the small bit parts he played. In his later years, Chaliapin achieved international stardom in more major roles. Chaliapin is perhaps most remembered by modern audiences for the film The Name of the Rose (1986), in which he played the venerable Jorge de Burgos. He had a major role in Inferno (1980). One of his most memorable roles was as the perplexed grandfather in Moonstruck (1987), starring Cher. The producers, in deciding whether to hire him for the role, sought the advice of Sean Connery, who is reputed to have said, \\"He's great, but he will steal the show.\\" Chaliapin also played the role of Leonides Cox, Robert De Niro's father in Stanley & Iris (1990). His last notable film role was as Professor Bartnev in The Inner Circle (1991), a true story about Soviet Russia under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin. In one of his briefest roles, Chaliapin dies in the arms of Gary Cooper in the opening scenes of For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), based on Ernest Hemingway's 1940 novel. Of Chaliapin's early film roles, one of the most memorable was in Victor Tourjansky's Prisoner of the Volga (1959). Much of his filmography lies in Italian films, including an appearance as Julius Caesar in Federico Fellini's film Roma. Chaliapin was reunited with his mother, who then was 87 years old, in Rome in 1960. His mother's emigration was helped by the reforms (the so-called \\"thaw\\") of then Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. The price of this was having to leave behind a museum-quality home and a magnificent art collection in Moscow as collected by Feodor Chaliapin, Sr. The only objects of art permitted to leave Russia were photograph albums of Chaliapin's childhood and youth in Moscow. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last premier of the Soviet Union, instituted political and economic reforms known as perestroika. Under these reforms, Chaliapin was able to remove his father's remains from Paris to Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. The grave is marked by a white marble statue of Chaliapin, Sr. In 1992, Chaliapin died of natural causes after an illness in Rome, where he had lived since World War II. He was survived by his twin sister, Tatiana Chaliapin Chernoff, and several nieces and nephews. He is buried at the Cimitero Flaminio, Provincia di Roma, in Lazio, Italy.

He served as Ambassador to Mexico, France, and China, as a member of the House of Representatives from the fourth district of Maryland, as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and as the 39th Governor of Maryland. Early life and military career McLane was born in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1815, the son of Louis McLane and Catherine Mary Milligan. His birthplace, the Louis McLane House, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. He received early education from a private school conducted by John Bullock, a Quaker. He received higher education from St. Mary‚Äôs College in Baltimore, Maryland until he moved with his family to Europe, after his father had been appointed as an ambassador to England. He was sent to Paris to receive further education from Coll√®ge Bourbon, where he became acquainted with the Marquis de Lafayette. McLane and his family moved back to the United States in 1833 when his father was appointed Secretary of the Treasury. The same year, McLane was appointed as a cadet in the United States Military Academy at West Point by President Andrew Jackson, and graduated in July 1837 with a commission as second lieutenant of Artillery in the United States Army. McLane was deployed with his regiment to Florida during the Seminole War in 1837 under the command of General Thomas S. Jesup, and in 1838 was re-deployed to the west under General Winfield Scott. In 1838, he was transferred to the Corps of Topographical Engineers under General Zachary Taylor. In 1841, he was sent to the Northern Lakes for survey work and was also sent to Europe to examine the dikes and drainage systems in the Netherlands and Italy. While in Europe, he met his future wife, Georgine Urquhart, and eventually fathered two children with her. McLane resigned his commission in 1843 to pursue the study of law, and was admitted to the bar the same year. He commenced practice in Baltimore thereafter. Political and diplomatic career =Early political career and election to Congress= In 1845, McLane was elected as a representative of Baltimore City to the Maryland House of Delegates after successfully campaigning for President James K. Polk a year previous. In 1846, McLane ran for Congress and defeated his Whig opponent, John P. Kennedy, by 500 votes. He was re-elected two years later, and served from March 4, 1847, to March 3, 1851. In Congress, McLane was seen as an exceptional orator, and, during his second term, was chosen as chairman of the Committee on Commerce. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1850. After his tenure in Congress, McLane moved to the Western United States to become a counsel for a mining corporation, which was engaged in legal activities regarding property in California. He remained out West until 1852, when he returned to Maryland to serve as Presidential elector for Franklin Pierce. =Ambassador to China and Mexico= Robert Milligan McLane In 1853, during the Taiping Rebellion, President Pierce appointed McLane as commissioner to China, with the powers of a Minister Plenipotentiary, and at the same time accredited to Japan, Siam, Korea, and Cochin China. Despite the civil war, McLane was ordered to secure commercial relations between China and the United States, and was also ordered to negotiate with the rebels while also retaining diplomatic relations with the Imperial Government. He successfully renewed trade relations between both nations, but returned to the United States in 1854 due to poor health. After his return to the United States, he resumed his political activity by serving as delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1856, during which he supported future President James Buchanan. The United States and Mexico had broken off diplomatic relations in 1858, after which civil war broke out in Mexico. McLane was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Mexico on March 7, 1859, and was charged to determine if the government of Benito Ju√°rez, in opposition to the Emperor, was worthy of recognition. He also negotiated, as ambassador, the McLane-Ocampo Treaty, which would have expanded the transit rights of the U.S. across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to include an interoceanic canal concession. However, the treaty was not ratified by the United States Senate. McLane retired as Ambassador to Mexico on December 22, 1860 :c =American Civil War and return to Congress= During the American Civil War, the Federal Government, under President Abraham Lincoln, forcibly forbade the state of Maryland from joining the Confederacy. McLane was a member of the delegation sent to Washington, D.C. to question the actions of the Federal Government. McLane personally believed that the Federal Government did not have the Constitutional right to force Maryland into submission, but determined, along with the rest of the delegation, that Maryland should not secede. During the rest of the War, McLane refocused his attention back towards his law practice, as he had been appointed counsel for the Western Pacific Railroad in the winter of 1863. McLane would continue to devote his energies towards his law practice until well after the end of the Civil War, and did not re-enter politics until the Democratic National Convention in 1876. He entered the Maryland State Senate in 1877, representing Baltimore City. He left the State Senate in 1879 to again run for election to Congress. He was successful, and served two terms from March 4, 1879, to March 3, 1883. During his first term in Congress, he was chairman of the Committee on Pacific Railroads. =Governor of Maryland and Ambassador to France= In 1883, the Maryland Democratic Party nominated McLane to be the next Governor of Maryland. In the election, McLane handily defeated his Republican opponent, Hart Benton Holton, by 12,000 votes. During his tenure, several notable pieces of legislation were passed, including the establishment of the Bureau of Statistics and Labor Information, and the establishment of a universal time standard throughout the state. McLane only served as governor for slightly over a year, from January 8, 1884, until his resignation on March 27, 1885, having been appointed by President Grover Cleveland as United States Minister Plenipotentiary to France. McLane moved to France with his wife, whom he had met there many years previously, to carry out his ambassadorial duties. He established permanent residence in Paris even after his tenure as ambassador expired in 1889, due to his wife's declining health. His own health began to decline in 1891, culminating in 1898 when he died. His body was returned to Baltimore, and was interred at Greenmount Cemetery. He was an hereditary member of the Maryland Society of the Cincinnati. The Maryland State Oyster Police Force (‚ÄúOyster Navy‚Äù), later the State Fishery Force steamer , serving the state from 1884‚Äî1945 with a brief World War I period commissioned USS Governor R. M. McLane (SP-1328) was named in his honor. References *Frank F. White, Jr., The Governors of Maryland 1777‚Äì1970 (Annapolis: The Hall of Records Commission, 1970), 201‚Äì205.

They have released 8 albums and featured as the Turkish entry to the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"For Real\\", finishing fourth.  Band history  Athena (ah-T'hƒõn-ah) was formed by twin brothers G√∂khan √ñzoƒüuz and Hakan √ñzoƒüuz as a thrash metal band in 1987. After an unsuccessful first album, they switched their style to ska punk sometime later. Athena released their second album Holigan in 1998. The distinct ska sound of the album was welcomed by the local record buying public so much so that the title song Holigan was adopted as a march by football supporters of all ages at the stadiums. The album hit various Turkish charts and stayed at the top for a considerable amount of time. Shortly after releasing Holigan, Athena did a large scale tour of Turkey. One of the significant moments of the tour was their show at A√ßikhava Tiyatrosu in Istanbul. They later opened for Rolling Stones at a concert at Ali Sami Yen Stadium, then home to the Turkish football club Galatasaray. Athena was the face of Turkey as part of the Millennium Concert at Taksim Square in Istanbul on the first night of 2000. The said concert was broadcast live by the Turkish channel NTV. They were later invited to the Popkomm Festival held in K√∂ln, Germany where they performed with the Beastie Boys. Their third album ‚ÄúTam Zamanƒ± ≈ûimdi‚Äù was released in 2000 and the first single Ya≈üamak Var Ya was an instant hit in Turkey. The album sales reached gold status in an extremely short time. Their tour was sold out as a result of their exploding popularity. They performed a series of concerts in Germany pairing up with the German ska band The Fritz. After the tour, their song Devam Bo≈üver was included in the album World of Ska Volume 11, released in Europe by the ska label Pork Pie Records. They later recorded the song Oniki Dev Adam (12 Giant Men) for the Turkish national basketball team. The Turkish team finished runner-up in the EuroBasket 2001 and many European newspapers commented that the song, sung by the team‚Äôs supporters during the games, led the team play better. In January 2002, Athena‚Äôs fourth album Her ≈ûey Yolunda was released. Two songs from this album, √ñp√ºc√ºk and Beyoƒülu were major hits. In 2003 Athena became part of an anti-war movement against the Iraqi war and contributed to the collaborative song Sava≈üa Hi√ß Gerek Yok (No Need for War), performing with many other musicians. Athena was the guest group at the huge dance show directed by Beyhan Murphy for Turkish Opera and Ballet. They also headlined the H2000 Festival June 2003 with Starsailor. Athena were among the headliners of the Rock'n Coke Festival of 2003 together with such acts as Pet Shop Boys, The Cardigans, Suede, Simple Minds, Sugababes, Dirty Vegas. On May 15, 2004, Athena represented Turkey at the Eurovision Song Contest with For Real. In an unprecedented result, the ska band finished 4th in the contest. After Eurovision, their maxi single For Real was released in Germany and Greece. Athena‚Äôs first concert after the Eurovision Song Contest was the European ‚Äì Turkish Festival in Berlin which was broadcast live on TRT (Turkish National TV). After the concert, and already popular in Germany, Athena was a guest on TV Total, a popular German talk show where they performed live. In June 2004 Athena‚Äôs new album US was released in Turkey. With the release of their fifth self-titled album, \\"Athena\\" in 2005, their sound showed signs of change once more, with the band experimenting with an alternative rock sound this time. In 2010 the band released the album Pis, which followed this change in style. In 2011, the band recorded a cover of Frank Sinatra's famous song \\"My Way\\" and performed it on the Rock'n Coke festival. Turkish version of the song's lyrics written by G√∂khan √ñzoƒüuz under the title \\"Ben B√∂yleyim\\". On September 8, 2012, they opened for Red Hot Chili Peppers in Istanbul. G√∂khan and Hakan √ñzoƒüuz were among the four jury members of the third season of the reality television singing competition ‚ÄòO Ses T√ºrkiye‚Äô aired by TV8 (the Turkish version of the television show The Voice). In 2014, Athena released an album named Alt√ºst. The most controversial song in that album is ‚ÄúSes Etme‚Äù because of the music video which published in 2016. The music video features the day of a transgender woman. Athena criticized the prejudice against transgender people and the hate crime in this song.

Biography Dulce Mar√≠a Loynaz was the daughter of the famous General Enrique Loynaz del Castillo, a hero of the Cuban Liberation Army and author of the lyrics of the march theme, \\"El Himno Invasor\\", and sister of poet Enrique Loynaz Mu√±oz. Dulce Mar√≠a was born in Havana City, on December 10, 1902, in a family of great sensibility towards artistic and cultural manifestations and deep patriotic feelings. Home schooled, she grew up in a familiar environment highly propitious for poetry. Although Dulce Mar√≠a had a sheltered childhood, her early adulthood was much more adventurous, including experiences available at that time only to wealthy young women, even outside of Cuba. She published a number of poems in her teens and twenties. She completed the Doctorate of Civil Law at the University of Havana in 1927, but she practiced law rarely. She was able to travel widely. In addition, her talents and her family's social position brought her into personal contact with some of the major Spanish-language authors of the century, including Spanish author Federico Garc√≠a Lorca and Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral (who won the Nobel Prize in 1945), Cuban author Alejo Carpentier and the Spanish writer Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, who won the Nobel Prize. She published her first poems in La Naci√≥n, in 1920. Around those years, she travelled to North America, Europe and some other countries highlighting, Turkey, Syria, Libya, Palestine and Egypt (1929), Mexico (1937), South America (1946-1947) and the Canary Islands (1947-1951) where she was declared adoptive daughter. She achieved her Doctorate in Civil Law at Havana University. She was a practicing lawyer even though she disliked it, but stopped practicing in 1961. Loynaz began writing Jardin in 1928, the year after she earned the Doctor of Law degree from the University of Havana and completed the novel in 1935, shortly after Cuban women obtained the right to vote. During these early decades of the twentieth century, a time of great feminist activity, a dynamic and effective women's movement flourished in Cuba and women's rights became part of the Cuban political consciousness. The feminist attitude Loynaz displays in Jardin is tied strongly to the image of the city. The novel begins and ends with the heroine looking out from the garden toward a city that resembles Havana. In 1950, she published weekly chronicles at different publications of the epoch such as El Pa√≠s, Exc√©lsior, Social, Grafos, Diario de la Marina, El Mundo, Revista Cubana, Revista Bimestre Cubana and Or√≠genes. In 1953, she attended, as the university's guest, celebrations that marked the 700th year since the naming of Salamanca University. Her book Poemas sin nombre (Untitled Poems) was translated to Italian on 1955. She offered conferences and readings, not only in Cuba but also in Spain and Latin America. She was elected as member of Arts and Literature National Academy on 1951, of the Cuban Academy of Language on 1959 and the Spanish Royal Academy of Language on 1968. The Royal Academy of Spanish Language nominated her to Miguel de Cervantes Prize in 1984. In 1985, Poes√≠as Escogidas (Selected Poems) was published in Havana and her poems book Bestiarium (written before 1959). During these years, she gave conferences and speeches, and received prizes and awards bestowed by different Cuban cultural institutions. The sobriety of her lyric expression, her exquisite handling of language and master use of Castilian language were the main reasons to take into account to confer her the King Alfonso X the Wise Order and on November 5, 1992, the Miguel de Cervantes Prize, honorable distinction she received in Spain in 1993 from King Juan Carlos I's hands. This is considered the Nobel prize in the world of the Spanish literature. In 1959 she voluntarily stopped writing and publishing in Cuba. In a situation such as the Cuba of the past 40 years, it is not surprising that a person as private in temperament as Dulce Mar√≠a Loynaz would seclude herself, or that her public statements have always been extremely discreet, patriotic and yet non-political. More perplexing is the fact that, according to all her closest friends, she entirely stopped writing poetry when the Revolution triumphed in 1959. Although her work was characterized by so many of her friends as a private vocation, perhaps the total disappearance of the social world which fostered it, silenced her. The discovery of her work by a large and enthusiastic audience in her home country when she was in her 80s, really for the first time and after more than 25 years of internal exile, must have been like the return of the dove in her poem, ‚ÄúNoah,‚Äù carrying the green branch that signifies a safe harbor. Fe de vida (Life's Faith), her last work, saw the light in 1993, while celebrating in Pinar del R√≠o, the First Ibero American Meeting about her work and life. Furthermore, some texts from her delicate creation have been musicalized by different singers/writers. She received several awards among them: National Order of Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes, Order of F√©lix Varela of the Culture, National Culture Distinctive Award, and the Alejo Carpentier Medal (Cuba). She was awarded the Cuban National Prize for Literature (1987). Dulce Mar√≠a Loynaz died in 1997 and was interred in the Col√≥n Cemetery, Havana.

He also served in the United States Senate, representing the State of Maryland, from 1868‚Äì1874, and in the House of Representatives, representing the second district (1849‚Äì1853) and fourth district (1853‚Äì1855) of Maryland. Early life and politics Hamilton was born in Boonsboro, Maryland, and received early schooling from a local tutor named John Brown. He went on to attend Hagerstown Academy, and later Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, from 1836‚Äì1840. After college, Hamilton studied law with former Maryland Congressman John Thomson Mason, Jr., and was admitted to the bar in 1845. He then commenced law practice in Hagerstown, Maryland. In 1846, Hamilton was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates, but failed to win re-election in 1847. He was, however, elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-first, Thirty-second, and Thirty-third Congresses, serving from March 4, 1849 ‚Äì March 3, 1855. While Hamilton was in Congress, even though his district was largely manufacturers and miners, he supported tariffs but only as a source of revenue for the government. Other actions while in Congress included his tenure as chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia during the Thirty-third Congress. From 1855 until 1868, Hamilton avoided politics and resumed the practice of law and farming in Hagerstown. During that time, he became widely known throughout Western Maryland as an excellent trial lawyer. United States Senate After his long absence from politics, Hamilton was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate by the General Assembly, and served from March 4, 1869, to March 3, 1875. Hamilton was a strong supporter of restoring southern sovereignty following the American Civil War, but voted against the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which granted voting rights to all men regardless of race. In 1871, Hamilton endorsed William Pinkney Whyte during the Maryland governor campaign, but regretted the decision thereafter following Whyte's actions as governor. In 1874, Hamilton was abandoned by the state Democratic Party during the nomination process for his senate seat, and was not considered by them for re-election. Instead, Hamilton ran for governor in 1875, but lost his party's nomination to fellow Democrat John Lee Carroll. Governor of Maryland After failing to receive nomination for governor, Hamilton again stepped away from the political arena, returning to his previous engagements in Western Maryland. During that time, however, he continued to push persistently for a Democratic nomination as governor of Maryland, which he succeeding in doing in 1879. Hamilton faced future U.S. Postmaster General, Republican James Albert Gary, during the election, and defeated him by more than 22,000 votes. As governor, Hamilton regularly conflicted with the state legislature, believing they were neglecting the state's economy. He sought to reduce government waste by abolishing excessive offices and positions, such as the office of Weighers of Grain and Hay, but again the legislature refused to cooperate with his program. He retired as governor on January 8, 1884, retaining popular support throughout the state. His hostile treatment of the legislature as governor, however, had made the state Democratic party again unreceptive towards him. Hamilton returned to Hagerstown where he avoided further involvement in state and national politics. He returned to the practice of law, but also worked to improve the city and county public works, streets, and water supply. He was maintained a great deal of popularity in Hagerstown and the surrounding areas, and his death following a long battle with illness was widely mourned. He is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery (Maryland). His daughter Josephine married the inventor Hiram Percy Maxim. His daughter Clare married Hayden Eames, brother of the opera singer Emma Eames. His granddaughter was actress Clare Eames, his great-granddaughter is actress Jennifer Howard, and his great-great-grandson is actor Tony Goldwyn.

History In 1905 in Oakland, California, 11-year- old Francis William \\"Frank\\" Epperson was mixing a powdered flavoring for soft drinks with water. He accidentally left it on the back porch overnight, with a stirring stick still in it. That night, the temperature dropped below freezing, and the next morning, Epperson discovered the drink had frozen to the stick, inspiring the idea of a fruit-flavored \\"Popsicle\\". In 1922, he introduced the creation at a fireman's ball, where according to reports it was \\"a sensation\\". In 1923, Epperson began selling the frozen pops to the public at Neptune Beach, an amusement park in Alameda, California. By 1924 Epperson had received a patent for his \\"frozen confectionery\\" which he called \\"the Epsicle ice pop\\". He renamed it to Popsicle, allegedly at the insistence of his children. Popsicles were originally sold in fruity flavors and marketed as a \\"frozen drink on a stick.\\" = Lawsuit and sale = Six months after receiving a patent for the Popsicle, Good Humor sued Popsicle Corporation. By October 1925, the parties settled out of court. Popsicle agreed to pay Good Humor a license fee to manufacture what was called frozen suckers from ice and sherbet products. Good Humor reserved the right to manufacture these products from ice cream, frozen custard, and the like. In 1925, Epperson sold the rights to the Popsicle to the Joe Lowe Company of New York. \\"I was flat and had to liquidate all my assets,\\" he recalled years later. \\"I haven't been the same since.\\" In 1989, Good Humor, now a subsidiary of Unilever, bought the rights to the Popsicle.

Popsicle brands sponsored the Popeye radio show in 1938‚Äì1939. The Popsicle brand began expanding from its original flavors after being purchased by Good Humor-Breyers in 1989. Under the Popsicle brand, Good Humor-Breyers holds the trademark for both Creamsicle and Fudgsicle. Creamsicle's center is vanilla ice cream, covered by a layer of flavored ice. Fudgsicle, originally sold as Fudgicle, is a flat, frozen dessert that come on a stick and are chocolate- flavored with a texture somewhat similar to ice cream. Firecrackers are a brand of Popsicles that come in a shape resembling a firecracker. These take a similar appearance to the bomb pop.

Friendly (born Ferdinand Friendly Wachenheimer, October 30, 1915 ‚Äì March 3, 1998) was a president of CBS News and the creator, along with Edward R. Murrow, of the documentary television program See It Now. He originated the concept of public-access television cable TV channels. Early career Friendly was born to a Jewish family in New York City to Therese Friendly Wachenheimer and Samuel Wachenheimer, a jewelry manufacturer. The family moved from Manhattan's Morningside Heights district (where later, Friendly would teach for a quarter-century) to Providence, Rhode Island, where he graduated from Hope Street High School in 1933. He received an associate's degree from Nichols Junior College in 1936. He entered radio broadcasting in 1937 at WEAN in Providence, Rhode Island, where he reversed the order of his middle and last names, and began using Friendly as his last name. In World War II, he served as an instructor in the Army Signal Corps and reported for an Army newspaper in the Pacific Theater (The CBI Roundup) before mustering out as a master sergeant in 1945. His decorations included the Legion of Merit and the Soldier's Medal. By the late 1940s, Friendly was an experienced radio producer. It was in this role that Friendly first worked with Murrow on the Columbia Records historical albums, I Can Hear It Now. The first entry in the series, released on Thanksgiving Day 1948, covered the crisis and war years 1933‚Äì1945. It was a ground-breaker in that it used clips of radio news coverage and speeches of the major events from that twelve-year time span. Friendly created the concept after noticing the new use of audiotape in regular radio news coverage, as opposed to wire or disc recordings that had been an industry standard. Periodically, Friendly created recordings of news events when such recordings didn't exist or, recreated ones that were considered too chaotic to use on an album . CBS correspondent David Schoenbrun, in his memoir On and Off the Air, said he once was forced by Friendly to ask Charles de Gaulle if he would recreate the speech he gave upon his return to Paris (de Gaulle refused). The recreations never were identified as such, and trying to separate the real from the recreated, continues to be problematic for radio historians. Although Murrow was an established CBS name and at the time Columbia Records was owned by CBS, Friendly's next full-time work came as a news producer at NBC. It was there that Friendly originated the idea for the news-oriented quiz show Who Said That?, first hosted by NBC newsman Robert Trout, followed by Walter Kiernan, and John Charles Daly. The program, which Friendly edited, ran irregularly on NBC and then ABC between 1948 and 1955. Friendly later wrote, directed, and produced the NBC Radio series The Quick and the Dead during the Summer of 1950. It was about the development of the atomic bomb. It featured Trout, Bob Hope, and New York Times writer Bill Laurence, who had won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Manhattan Project. CBS years After the success of The Quick and the Dead, Friendly was recruited to work full-time for CBS by news executive Sig Mickelson. That fall, Murrow and Friendly collaborated to produce a CBS Radio documentary series inspired by their record albums‚Äîa weekly show called Hear It Now that was hosted by Murrow. The show moved to television as See It Now on Sunday, November 18, 1951. Murrow and Friendly broadcast a revealing See It Now documentary analysis on Senator Joseph McCarthy (airing March 9, 1954) that has been credited with changing the public view of McCarthy and, being a key event leading to McCarthy's fall from power. It was an extension of the duo's continuing probe of the conflict between McCarthy's anti-Communist crusade and individual rights. The previous fall, Murrow and Friendly had produced a notable See It Now episode on the topic, when the show probed the case of Air Force Reserve Lieutenant Milo Radulovich, who had lost his security clearance because of the supposed leftist leanings of his sister and father‚Äîevidence the Air Force kept sealed. Five weeks later, Radulovich was reinstated by the secretary of the Air Force. Radulovich was granted leave of his duties that same year, however, when he was forced to move temporarily to Phoenix, Arizona to care for his nephew who had recently been involved in a dog mauling incident. After See It Now ended, in the Summer of 1958, Friendly and Murrow worked together on its successor, CBS Reports, although Friendly alone was executive producer and Murrow no more than an occasional reporter and narrator. Their most famous CBS Reports installment‚Äîthe probe of migrant farm workers Harvest of Shame‚Äîaired in November 1960 and still is considered one of television's finest single programs. After Murrow's departure from the television network in 1961, Friendly continued to oversee several notable CBS Reports documentaries, including Who Speaks for Birmingham?, Birth Control and the Law, and The Business of Heroin. Under CBS president James T. Aubrey Jr. the pressures on CBS News operations arose and escalated. Aubrey constantly fought with Friendly. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey spoke at length of how much money the news was costing the company, being a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. CBS founder and board chairman William S. Paley supported the news, however, and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. In 1962, Aubrey ordered that there would be fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move. To Friendly's relief, in 1965 Aubrey was fired. Friendly served as president of CBS News from 1964 to 1966. =CBS resignation= In 1966, Friendly resigned from CBS when the television network ran a scheduled episode of I Love Lucy instead of broadcasting live coverage of the first United States Senate hearings questioning American involvement in Vietnam. Onetime CBS News president Dick Salant, the executive who preceded and later succeeded Friendly in the role, wrote in his memoirs that Friendly's problem was compounded by his inability to make such a request directly to the top CBS management (William S. Paley and Frank Stanton), as previous CBS News presidents had. In this case, Friendly had to go through a new supervisor at the executive level, CBS Broadcast Group president Jack Schneider. Later career After he left CBS, Friendly initially worked as a broadcast consultant at the Ford Foundation, a position he maintained until 1980. In this capacity, he initially developed an infeasible plan to allocate revenue generated by communications satellites toward the nascent medium of public television before he emerged as an integral figure in \\"negotiations about interconnection that would lead to the creation of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in 1969.\\" By ensuring National Educational Television's subordination to the Washington-based PBS through the merger of NET with New York City's WNDT (and including a $2 million Ford Foundation grant to bolster the station's local programming), Friendly reluctantly placated members of the Nixon administration who perceived NET as a propagandistic front for the Eastern Establishment. Despite his relative dearth of formal education‚Äînot atypical among contemporaneous practitioners‚Äîhe was appointed to the tenured faculty of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism as the Edward R. Murrow Professor of Broadcast Journalism in 1966. Over the next thirteen years, Friendly assumed stewardship of the school's hitherto threadbare broadcast journalism concentration. To the chagrin of some of his colleagues, he often eclipsed other top administrators (including 1970s-era dean Elie Abel, who was personally recommended by Friendly for the post) in the popular consciousness. The non-degree Summer Program in Journalism for Members of Minority Groups (renamed the Michele Clark Fellowship Program for Minority Journalists following the death of a distinguished alumna in a December 1972 airplane crash) was directed by Friendly from 1968 to 1975, enabling many individuals (most notably media-savvy attorney Geraldo Rivera) to switch careers during the tempestuous epoch. A proposed \\"University Broadcast Laboratory\\" (an experimental Sunday news magazine initially proposed by Friendly in partnership with the Ford Foundation, Columbia, and NET) only manifested in attenuated form, however, as Public Broadcast Laboratory from 1967 to 1969; administrative and content circumscriptions imposed by the University trustees precipitated his divestiture from the program and hastened the retirement of Journalism School dean Edward W. Barrett in 1968. As chair of Mayor John Lindsay's Task Force on CATV and Telecommunications that year, Friendly revived his revenue-sharing proposal by advising cable companies to set aside two channels that the public could lease for a minor fee, ultimately enabling the development of public-access television. Spurred by classroom discussions, he inaugurated the Media and Society Friendly Seminars under the auspices of the Journalism School in 1974 as private conference fora on media, law (particularly the Constitution and the First Amendment) and public policy for the edification of professionals from disparate fields. Drawing upon the case method employed by many professional schools and the Socratic method for interlocution, these eventually evolved into PBS's long-running Fred Friendly Seminars in 1981. Following his statutory retirement in 1979, Friendly relinquished control of the Journalism School's broadcast program; however, he continued to teach and produce the seminars at Columbia as an administrative officer of the University before retiring in earnest in 1992. By the time of his death in 1998, Friendly \\"was criticized by some working in network news as being isolated in academia and out of touch with the new realities‚Äîand limitations‚Äîof the business of broadcast journalism.\\" The broadcast newsroom and an endowed professorship remain named for Friendly, attesting to his outsized influence at a critical juncture in the development of the school. While in academia, he authored several books, including The Good Guys, The Bad Guys, And The First Amendment (an account of a number of First Amendment court cases and particularly, of the Fairness Doctrine), Minnesota Rag (a history of Near v. Minnesota), The Constitution: That Delicate Balance, and Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control (a memoir about his sixteen years at CBS). In 1986, Friendly was appointed by Mayor Edward I. Koch to New York City's Charter Revision Commission. Chaired by Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., the body's recommendations led to the dissolution of the New York City Board of Estimate following the adoption of the city's 1990 charter, whereupon the commission dissolved. Friendly was a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College from April 9-April 12, 1986. He also served as a visiting professor at Yale University (1984) and Bryn Mawr College (1981). In addition to his work with the seminars, Friendly produced and hosted a ten-part series on PBS, Ethics in America, on which a panel of leading intellectuals debated and discussed modern ethical issues.

History Junior College District 300 was voted into existence in a referendum in March 1964. In March 1965, a second referendum was passed approving the purchase of an campus site at Fifth Avenue and Palmer Street in River Grove. The school was named Triton College in recognition of the three high school districts that it encompassed ‚Äì Elmwood Park, Leyden, and Proviso Township. Triton College opened in September 1965 and held classes at several of the high schools in its district. About 1,200 students were enrolled, and full-time in-district tuition was US$5 per semester hour. Construction on the permanent campus began in June 1967 with the Technology building and proceeded in phases. With the opening of the Learning Resource Center in 1974, the original campus plan was essentially complete, except for some athletic facilities and the Performing Arts Center, a large auditorium planned for the area now occupied by the soccer field, but never built. The original Cernan Space Center building, located north of the Learning Resource Center, was plagued by latent construction defects, and, after being used for several years, was demolished and replaced by the present building located nearby. In 1972, another referendum was passed adding Oak Park and River Forest, Riverside Brookfield, and Ridgewood high school districts to the original three, forming Community College District 504. This district was expanded to its current size in 1974 by the addition of Rosemont and Pennoyer school districts. By 1975, enrollment had grown to nearly 20,000, in-district tuition had increased to US$11 per semester hour, and Triton had become the largest single-campus community college in Illinois. The campus was expanded by the acquisition of the North Avenue Drive-In theater, which closed in 1973. This area, designated the \\"East Campus\\" and located across Fifth Avenue from the original (\\"West\\") campus, was cleared and used mainly for the construction of athletic facilities, as well as a small auditorium as part of the Collins Center.  Campus  Triton College sits on a 110 acre campus that features electronic classrooms, labs, sports facilities, a library and bookstore, an art gallery and performing arts center, botanical gardens and greenhouses, culinary arts program restaurant and bistro, and the Cernan Earth and Space Center, which is a public planetarium. Recent renovations include the Health Sciences Building, The Student Center Building, and Symonds-Puckett field. The campus is also the home of Triton Troupers Circus. = Gallery = 437x437px 542x542px596x596px396x396px 467x467px525x525px  Academics  Triton College facilitates accredited Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Associate of Fine Arts, and Associate of Applied Science for transfer and career. The institution also offers English as a second language (ESL) and GED classes. Triton College is a member of the Illinois Articulation Initiative and has transfer agreements with universities across the state, such as the University of Illinois. In addition, students can earn bachelor's degrees on Triton's campus from Southern Illinois University, Dominican University, Benedictine University, and others through the University Center. The college also offers the academically rigorous Scholars Program for high achieving incoming freshman. = Rankings = In 2016, Payscale.com ranked Triton College the top two-year college in Illinois and among the top in the United States according to salaries of its graduates.  Student life  Triton College boasts a diverse majority-minority student body with sizable populations of Hispanic/Latino, white, African American, and Asian students. The college is also a Hispanic-serving institution. About 75% of students are from the inner ring Chicago suburbs, while residents of Chicago and other cities, states, and countries make up the other 25%. Triton students participate in Model UN, Triton Student Association, and many clubs on a variety of interests. Students also participate in the Tritonysia play festival, write and edit the Fifth Avenue Journal, and other artistic endeavors. = Athletics = Triton competes in NJCAA and is a member of the North Central Community College Conference (NC4).

Early life Carroll was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Col. Charles Carroll (b. 1801) and Mary Diggs Lee (b. 1800). Col. Charles Carroll was the great-grandson of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, (1737‚Äì1832), the only Catholic signer and longest living, last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence. John Lee Carroll was also a great-grandson of Maryland's second (and seventh) Governor of Maryland, Thomas Sim Lee, (1745‚Äì1819). At the age of ten, in 1840, Carroll was sent to Mount Saint Mary's College in Frederick County's Emmitsburg, where he remained for two years. After leaving he attended Georgetown University in Georgetown, near Washington, D.C., and then the secular part of St. Mary's College, on North Paca Street in Baltimore, for another three years. Carroll then decided to enter the legal profession, and attended Harvard Law School of Harvard College, (now Harvard University), in Cambridge, Massachusetts, adjacent to Boston for two terms. Career After finishing schooling, Carroll worked as a student lawyer for the law office of Brown and Brune in Baltimore. He was admitted to the bar in 1851. Carroll practiced law in Maryland from 1854 until 1858. He ran as a Howard County Democratic candidate for the state General Assembly in 1854, (shortly after the separation of the former Howard or Western District of Anne Arundel County and the \\"erection\\"/establishment of Howard as the 22nd of the state's 23 counties), however losing to his opponent from the newly-dominant \\"Know Nothing\\" Party (also known as the American Party) during the political crises of the 1850s. Carroll then moved to New York City and while there, accepted a position as deputy clerk and United States Commissioner in the office of the clerk of the United States District Court. He stayed there until 1861, at the outbreak of the Civil War, when he returned to Maryland, where he then remained the rest of his life. When he returned to Maryland, Carroll purchased the \\"Doughoregan Manor\\", historic family estate in Howard County, near Ellicott City from his older brother Charles Carroll. Carroll was elected into the Maryland State Senate of the General Assembly of Maryland in 1867 and served two terms. He was elected President of the State Senate in 1874. In 1875, Carroll became the Democratic Party nominee for Governor of Maryland, opposed by James Morrison Harris. He won by a 10,000-vote majority and was inaugurated as governor on January 12, 1876. =Strikes and unrest in 1877= The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 began with a sudden cut in wages by the B. & O. Railroad's Board of Directors and President John Work Garrett, which caused workers to walk off the job in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and spread nationwide to the rest of the B. & O., as well as several other lines. Governor Carroll called up the 5th and 6th Regiments of the Maryland National Guard to stop railroad workers from striking in Cumberland, Hagerstown and in Frederick County's shops and roundhouses at Brunswick. Once the news spread by telegraph east, it touched off riots in Baltimore at the Mount Clare Shops and the yards at the B. & O.'s Camden Street Station, headquarters of the line. The National Guard attempted to march from their armories to Camden Station‚Äîthe Fifth Regiment from the armory in the assembly hall above the Richmond Market along North Howard Street in the northwest city, and the Sixth from their armory at North Front and East Fayette Streets, near Jonestown/Old Town. The Fifth marched south down Howard Street and the Sixth attempted to march south on Front Street along the east bank of the Jones Falls for a few blocks then west on East Baltimore Street, through the middle of the downtown business district (and avoided the obvious associations of marching along the waterfront of Pratt Street, as the 6th Massachusetts Regiment did 16 years before, with its tragic memories). Despite this precaution, each regiment had to again literally fight its way through the streets of the city, attacked by projectiles, rocks and angry mobs the entire way. Conflict gripped the city and Governor Carroll was powerless to stem the tide. Later, additional reinforcements of Federal troops were called in by newly elected 18th President Rutherford B. Hayes to restore order in Baltimore. =Later career= In later years, Carroll served on the Howard County Board of Education and served in 1883 on an early grand jury that used both Caucasian and African American members. Carroll was also a member of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the Revolution. Marriage & children Arms of Carroll of Maryland Carroll was married twice, first to Anita Phelps (April 23, 1838 ‚Äì March 24, 1873), daughter of Royal Phelps of New York, on April 24, 1856.

First broadcast on October 2, 1930, and functioning as an outreach ministry of Lutheran Hour Ministries, it is a Christian outreach radio program. Beginning in 2018, Rev. Dr. Michael Zeigler became the Speaker of The Lutheran Hour. The Lutheran Hour is the flagship program for Lutheran Hour Ministries (LHM), which is a Christian outreach ministry supporting churches. History In 1917, a group of 12 men attending a convention of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod in Milwaukee met to settle a $100,000 debt incurred by the Church body. They accomplished that goal, and in the process, formed the Lutheran Laymen's League (LLL). =Radio programming= In 1930, the LLL made a commitment to fund one year of broadcasting a weekly national radio program to be called The Lutheran Hour. The first program was broadcast October 2, 1930. The program's speakers have included Dr. Walter A. Maier, Dr. Armin C. Oldsen, Dr. Lawrence Acker, Dr. Oswald Hoffmann, Rev. Wallace Schulz, Dr. Dale A. Meyer, and the Rev. Dr. Ken Klaus. Originally a KFUO program, 'Woman to Woman' (1991-2011) hosted by Phyllis Wallace began airing nationally in 1993 as a program of Lutheran Hour Ministries. Guests included Kurt Warner, Wynona Judd, and Barbara Mandrell. =International ministries= In 1940. the LLL ministry began The Lutheran Hour, broadcast by Dr. Andrew Melendez in Spanish. That same year the LLL opened its first international ministry center in the Philippines. Five years later, it opened a ministry center in Australia. With the scope of the organization becoming more worldwide in nature, the word \\"international\\" was officially added to the LLL's name in 1927. =1990s onwards= In 1992, due to the popularity of The Lutheran Hour radio program, the International LLL chose Lutheran Hour Ministries as the overall identity for its media outreach programs.

Dr. Michael Zeigler (2018-present) =2002 Removal of speaker Wallace Schulz= In July 2002, weeks after his promotion from associate speaker to main speaker, Dr. Wallace Schulz was involved in an LCMS controversy that resulted in his removal from the show. Acting in his capacity as LCMS Second Vice President, Schulz suspended LCMS Atlantic District president David Benke, ruling that Benke, by taking part in an inter-faith prayer event at Yankee Stadium to commemorate the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, had engaged in syncretism and unionism, practices prohibited by the LCMS. (Benke's suspension was later overturned on appeal.) The show's board of governors, shortly following Schulz's elevation to main speaker, had requested that he recuse himself from the Benke adjudication to avoid \\"a conflict of interest\\" in his duties to the International Lutheran Laymen's League, which operates Lutheran Hour Ministries and had not taken an official position on the Benke case in order to avoid alienating members holding differing views on the issue. When Schulz accepted the Benke case, the board relieved him of his duties while keeping him on the payroll, stating that the radio program had been \\"compromised\\" by Schulz's participation in church politics, and that it might serve to \\"polarize\\" the International Lutheran Laymen's League. The League offered Schulz a return to the show under condition that he accept stipulations for future conduct, but Schulz refused to accept these restrictions and thus did not return to the show. Schulz's removal, like the Benke case itself, proved controversial within the LCMS. His supporters argued that Schulz had a constitutional duty to rule in the case, and thus could not recuse himself upon the board of governors‚Äô request. The Rev. Eric Stefanski, in a column published by the conservative LCMS group Concord, accused the International Lutheran Laymen's League of waging \\"a massive, twisted PR battle\\" against Schulz, and of presenting him with \\"ultimatums that no pastor could agree to without denying his Ordination vows.\\" Supporters of Schulz also argued that a drop in financial receipts at the ILLL, which led to layoffs and program cancellations in 2003, were attributable primarily to donor and listener dissatisfaction over the speaker's removal. Opponents of Schulz's actions praised the decision to suspend the speaker, with many arguing, as a column published by the liberal LCMS organization Jesus First stated, that those who disagreed with Schulz's actions were \\"working hard to present views more representative of this church.\\"\\"Reaction to Suspension Reflects Real LCMS,\\" Jesus First website, August 1, 2002] Footnotes External links * * Lutheran Hour Ministries Category:1930 radio programme debuts Category:American Christian radio programs Category:Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod Category:Lutheranism in the United States Category:1930s American radio programs ","title":"The Lutheran Hour"},{"id":"1159744","text":"James Dandu (5 July 1970 ‚Äì 27 August 2002), also known by his stage name Cool James, was a Tanzanian‚ÄìSwedish hip hop recording artist and record producer.

He is probably best known for his acting roles in independent films and the sitcom Twitch City. Personal MacIvor was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia and educated at Dalhousie University in Halifax, and then at George Brown College in Toronto, Ontario. MacIvor is openly gay. He married Paul Goulet in 2006; they have since divorced. He has an Italian Greyhound, called 'Buddy'. Career In addition to his film and theatrical credits, MacIvor wrote the libretto to the opera \\"Hadrian,\\" for which Rufus Wainwright wrote the music. =Theatre= MacIvor founded the theatre company da da kamera with Michele Jelley in 1986 to independently produce his own work. He was in residence at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre - for whom he has written, directed, and acted. His plays include Never Swim Alone, This is a Play, Monster, Marion Bridge, You are Here, Cul-de-sac, and A Beautiful View. Five of MacIvor's plays were published as I Still Love You in 2006, in celebration of the twentieth anniversary of da da kamera, (Never Swim Alone, The Soldier Dreams, You are Here, In on It, and A Beautiful View), and won MacIvor a coveted Governor General's Award for Drama. =Solo theatre work= MacIvor is particularly well known for a series of solo shows created in collaboration with director Daniel Brooks. These include House, Here Lies Henry, Monster and Cul-de-sac.\\"Two Daniels‚Äô latest collaboration conjures the dead\\". Toronto Star, November 28, 2016. Karen Fricker. These incorporate a minimalist and meta-theatrical style. In House and Here Lies Henry, MacIvor portrays one character who speaks directly to the audience, acknowledging their presence. While the direct address of the audience continues in Monster and Cul-de-sac, MacIvor portrays several characters throughout the course of the piece and this direct address is occasionally broken up by dialogue between these characters. In 1992, 2-2 Tango was included in Making Out, the first anthology of Canadian plays by gay writers, alongside works by Ken Garnhum, Sky Gilbert, David Demchuk, Harry Rintoul and Colin Thomas.\\"Book symbolizes gays' advances\\". The Globe and Mail, June 4, 1992. The first three of these pieces were staged at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre in the 2006/2007 season as part of a tribute and retrospective of da da kamera's work. MacIvor and Brooks later collaborated with Iris Turcott to create the play Who Killed Spalding Gray?, in which MacIvor performs the part of a fictional character partly based on the style of deceased American actor Spalding Gray. The show premiered at the Halifax's Magnetic North Theatre Festival, and was later performed in Toronto at the Luminata Festival and at the High Performance Rodeo in Calgary =Film= In his early film work, MacIvor frequently collaborated with director Laurie Lynd, including on the short films RSVP in 1991, The Fairy Who Didn't Want to Be a Fairy Anymore in 1992, and the feature film House (1995). In the early 2000s MacIvor wrote, co-wrote and directed several independent films, which were usually made in his home province of Nova Scotia. They include Past Perfect, Marion Bridge, Whole New Thing and Wilby Wonderful. As an actor he appeared in Jeremy Podeswa's The Five Senses, had a recurring role in the television series Republic of Doyle and played Nathan in the iconic Canadian television series Twitch City. In recent years MacIvor has been working with director Bruce McDonald as screenwriter of the films Trigger and Weirdos (for which MacIvor won a Canadian Screen Award in 2017 for best original screenplay). Awards and honors In addition to winning the Governor General's Award for Drama in 2006, MacIvor has won other notable awards during his career. Mr. MacIvor also has two Chalmers New Play Awards, once in 1997 and 1992. =Plays= In 1998, MacIvor won the award for overall excellence at the New York International Fringe Festival for his play Never Swim Alone. In 2002, his play In On It earned him a GLAAD Award and a Village Voice Obie Award. In 2008, he was awarded the Siminovitch Prize in Theatre.

Development The AN1x is a first-generation virtual analogue physical modelling synthesizer. After Clavia released the original Nord Lead in 1995, Roland followed suit in 1996 with the JP-8000. Yamaha, having already been working on physical modelling synthesis for a number of years, released the AN1x in mid-1997. Whilst the AN1x has a similar chassis to other Yamaha synthesizers, such as the CS1x and particularly the CS2x, this is where the similarity ends. The latter use pre-loaded sample-based synthesis to generate sound, thus categorising them as romplers. The AN1x on the other hand is a fully fledged synthesizer. Yamaha's proprietary 'virtual analog' technology, models the components that traditionally occupy the signal path of an analog subtractive synthesizer. The VCOs, VCAs, VCFs, and LFOs etc., are all digitally modelled and rendered using DSP VLSI processor(s). It has been noted that the firmware of the AN1x contains simulated characteristics of Sequential Circuits' Prophet 5 and particularly the Prophet 10 synthesizers, as well as Yamaha's own CS range of polyphonic analog synthesisers. Yamaha purchased the rights to Sequential Circuits in 1987, following the dissolution of the company. Sequential's founder, Dave Smith subsequently became President of DSD Inc., a research and development division of Yamaha. During his time at Yamaha, in addition to his work on vector and wavetable synthesis, which culminated in the SY22 and TG33, Smith also worked on physical modelling synthesis and software synthesizer concepts. Research that laid the foundations for the development of the AN1x. Scenes and voice architecture The AN1x is a duo-timbral synthesizer, having two individual sets of voice parameters, called Scenes, for each of the 128 voice patches. Within each voice, each scene can be programmed to be similar sounding variations of each other, two identical copies of the same sound, or even two completely different sounding timbres. The user can either quickly switch between the two Scenes, or morph between them, which interpolates individual parameters, rather than simply crossfading. The result being complex new timbres being heard whilst morphing. It is also possible to save a snapshot of the timbre at any point during a morph, to become a new baseline timbre for one of the Scenes. Additionally, Scene data can be copied from, or saved to a different voice patch entirely. When the AN1x's Layer mode is set to either Split/Split Unison or Dual/Dual Unison, dual timbrality is possible, whereby Scenes can be set to receive MIDI data on two separate channels. Each Scene will have five notes of polyphony. The AN1x has a maximum polyphony of ten notes, although the actual polyphony depends upon the playing mode the synthesizer is set to. These being either a single monotimbral Scene, two Scenes layered or split, monophonic or polyphonic, and whether the note-multiplying Unison mode is active. Dual mode halves polyphony to five notes per voice, dividing each of the two internal 5-note DSP processors between both Scenes separately; dual timbral. In mono or dual modes, Unison uses five notes per key per Scene for a single voice (1 processor √ó 5 notes), or two notes per key for a dual voice (2 processors √ó 1 timbre per processor); thus, in Dual, Mono or Unison mode, the synthesizer is monophonic for each of the two Scenes. In polyphonic mode, Unison is only possible for single voices, each key takes two notes, of the same timbre, one from each of the two processors. Waveform oscillators The voice architecture is based on a dual oscillator design with multi-mode filter. Available waveforms are: Pulse-width modulation (PWM), Saw, Square, Saw2, Saw/Pulse Wave mix, and Saw/Square mix. Additional waves, Inner 1-3 are available for the first oscillator (OSC1) in oscillator sync mode. Triangle and sine waves are possible by altering the shape of pulse waves. The AN1x has a wave shaping Edge tool, which can facilitate 128 intermediate waves. The first oscillator can be split to have a master, main and a tuneable slave sub- oscillator, when activated via three oscillator sync algorithms. The master and/or slave oscillator within OSC1 can be modulated by the first low- frequency oscillator (LFO1), either jointly or individually. The AN1x has twin operator frequency modulation (FM), comprising four algorithms, where the first oscillator is modulated by the second. Finally there is ring modulation and white noise. When set to Unison mode, the AN1x layers five oscillators for each Scene timbre. Whilst this reduces polyphony, Unison thickens up the sound considerably. Additionally, stereo separation can be set for panning, as well as the tuning of the five layered oscillators. The overall effect is not too dissimilar from the Roland JP-8000 supersaw waveform, except that Unison can be applied to waveforms other than the sawtooth wave. Filters, envelopes, low frequency oscillators and control matrix Each of the two scenes that make up a single voice is composed of an amplitude envelope, a filter envelope, a pitch envelope, and a three-band equaliser. These affect the combined two oscillators on a per-note basis. The AN1x has two LFOs. LFO1 comprises 21 waveforms: 5√ó sine variations, 5√ó triangle variations, 3√ó square variations, 4√ó saw variations and 4√ó sample and hold variations. LFO2 consists of a triangle wave only. These affect all notes at once, i.e. monophonic LFOs. The LFOs are fast, up to the audible note range. The AN1x has a non-resonant high-pass filter, which is situated in series with a multimode resonant filter, the latter offering a low-pass filter (LPF), high-pass filter (HPF), band-pass filter (BPF) and band elimination filter (BEF). The multimode filter is capable of resonant self oscillation. Additionally, feedback from the voltage controlled amplifier (VCA) is routed back to the oscillator mixer before the main filter, and frequency modulation can be used alongside oscillator sync. The AN1x has a comprehensive modulation matrix, comprising 16 sources and 96 destinations. Sequencing capabilities The AN1x features an arpeggiator with 30 preset patterns, a step sequencer with 16 steps, 256 total sequence patterns, 128 voice patterns 'one per voice' + 128 user patterns. All 256 patterns can be overwritten for use, and a 'Free Envelope Generator' '128 user patterns, one per voice'. The arpeggiator and sequencer can both output to MIDI and sync to MIDI timecode, and the arpeggiator can also be applied to incoming MIDI data. Furthermore, the notes may be fixed or transposed via the synthesizer's keyboard or MIDI input. The step sequencer can be used to send control data, such as filter cutoff values or notes to the synthesizer's tone generator or to MIDI output. Both the arpeggiator and step sequencer have several looping modes. The 'Free Envelope Generator' (Free EG) is a powerful motion control feature that allows the user to record controller movements for up to four parameters, '4 tracks, 1 parameter per track' for a duration of up to 16 seconds each, or 8 bars that are tempo linked. Note: If the tempo is set to 40bpm, with a 4/4 count, this would result in 48 seconds of recording time per track. When applied to a voice, the Free EG becomes an intrinsic component of the voice whilst it is played, allowing for complex and evolving organic movement of sound. The way in which the Free EG loops can also be set in various ways, as well as the keyboard tracking and triggering. Multi effects The effects section contains three different sets of programmable effects, as well as a programmable 3-band equaliser (EQ). The 14 variation effect types are: Chorus, '2 types', flanger, symphonic, phaser, auto pan, rotary speaker, pitch change, aural exciter, compressor, wah, distortion, overdrive and amp simulator. The five delay effect types are: Delay left- centre-right (LCR), delay left-right (LR), echo, cross delay and tempo delay, which automatically matches the delay time to the current tempo setting. The eight reverb effect types include three types of hall reverb, two types each of room and stage reverb, and a plate reverb. The voice signal initially passes through the variation and EQ sections in series, then on to the delay and reverb sections. The delay and reverb sections can be configured to operate in either series or parallel. Individual effects sections (variation, delay, reverb) or all effects, excluding the EQ, can be bypassed at will. Additionally, realtime controllers can be designated to control specific effect parameters. Control synthesizer As well as promoting its \\"Analog Physical Modelling\\", Yamaha referred to the AN1x as a \\"control synthesizer\\", in a similar vein to the CS1x and CS2x. This is due to each voice patch in the AN1x having 20 \\"control sets\\", which utilise assignments of the user- adjustable controls and MIDI control change messages to a number of numerical parameters within the sound engine. The user controls include: Keyboard pitch, velocity and channel aftertouch, a modulation wheel, a pressure-sensitive (X-axis,Z-axis) ribbon controller, two expression pedal input sockets, a footswitch input socket, and eight assignable parameter control knobs. The underlying philosophy of this arrangement is that the user doesn't have to alter the actual sound editing parameters whilst playing, instead using the assignable real-time controls mentioned above. The physical keyboard action includes velocity, aftertouch, and portamento. The X-Z ribbon controller, responds to horizontal sweeps and pressure. The eight realtime control knobs can also be pressed to display their current parameter values. Each knob and controller can have multiple parameters assigned to them. Controller resolution Being a first-generation virtual analog synthesizer, the AN1x's controller resolution responds by default to 128 increments from its built in controllers. Consequently, the user will sometimes hear slight but distinct stepping of the filter, especially when more pronounced resonance is used. However, there are several workarounds: The first is to press the control knobs while rotating them to access smoother increments. The second method involves the use of a MIDI controller or synthesizer, whose controllers generate higher resolution data values. The AN1x responds to this due to its mature MIDI implementation and NRPN recognition. The result being a smoothing out of the filter sweep, therefore giving a more authentic analog feel. Physical characteristics The keyboard's main housing is made of ABS plastic, and the chassis base is metal. Dimensions: (W) √ó (D) √ó (H). Weight: . Reception and usage Though containing more features than its contemporaries, the control interface of the AN1x initially proved frustrating for some users, due to its programming being matrix-based rather than one control per parameter like the Roland JP-8000. To counter these early misgivings, a sound set was released by Yamaha UK, called the London sound set, which contained clones of some of the JP-8000 presets. This helped to demonstrate the sound capabilities of the AN1x. In 2000, Yamaha used the AN1x synthesis architecture to produce the PLG150-AN plugin board for the CS6x. The following year, Yamaha followed the AN1x with the AN200, a groovebox-type desktop sound module. The AN1x has been used by numerous artists, including: Jean Michel Jarre, Psyclon Nine, History Of Guns, Velvet Acid Christ, Nine Inch Nails, Nitin Sawhney, Phish, Igor Khoroshev of YES, Steve Hillier of Dubstar, Jacob Thiele of The Faint, 808 State, Antti Pouta of Pariisin Kev√§t, Above & Beyond, Jesper Anderberg of The Sounds.

Anderson died from lung cancer November 30, 1965 at the age of 62.  Early life and education  Anderson was born in New Orleans to George Walter Anderson, a grain broker, and Annette McConnell Anderson, member of a prominent New Orleans family, who had studied art at Newcomb College. In 1922 he enrolled at the New York School of Fine and Applied Art (now Parsons School of Design). After a year at Parson's, he won a scholarship to study at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Here (1924‚Äì1928) he would study under iconoclastic modernists like Henry McCarter, Hugh Breckenridge, and Arthur Carles, winning a Packard Award for his animal drawing and a Cresson Traveling Scholarship which allowed him to spend a summer in France. Ocean Springs Returning to Ocean Springs after his years at the Academy, Anderson worked as a designer in the family business, Shearwater Pottery, founded by his older brother Peter. In 1928-29 he designed his earliest ceramic pieces: pelican and crab bookends, lampstands, peculiar \\"Resting\\" and \\"Sitting Geometric Cats,\\" a \\"Horse and Rider\\" and innumerable plates and vases. His work as a designer and decorator at Shearwater Pottery, from 1928 until his death included incised pieces, sgraffito work, underglaze decoration, woodcarvings of saints, and designs for furniture. Among his early projects, launched with his younger brother, James (\\"Mac\\"), was a \\"Shearwater Pottery Annex\\" which produced inexpensive figurines, giving Anderson enough of an income to marry Agnes Grinstead in 1932, an art history graduate of Radcliffe College, who would later write a poignant memoir of their life together (Approaching the Magic Hour). During the early years, manufacturing of the figurines, which he called \\"widgets,\\" prevented Anderson from painting and led to considerable tension. In 1934, commissioned by a family friend, Ellsworth Woodward, Anderson painted an ambitious mural in the auditorium of the Ocean Springs Public School (\\"Ocean Springs Past and Present\\") as part of Public Works of Art Project. Paintings from this period include: \\"Indians Hunting,\\" \\"Jockeys Riding Horses,\\" four oil portraits of Sissy, 1933‚Äì37, \\"Black Skimmer,\\" \\"Androcles and Lion,\\" \\"Man on Horse,\\" and Birth of Achilles (Memphis Brooks Museum of Art), along with watercolors of flowers, animals, and birds; studies for a projected book on birds of the southeastern U.S.; and linoleum blockprints, including \\"Tourist Cards\\", \\"Alphabet,\\" nursery rhymes, \\"On the River,\\" \\"Valkyries,\\" \\"Butterfly Book,\\" and scenes from Shearwater Pottery. Designs for a second mural, in the Jackson, Mississippi Court House, were accepted by an illustrious committee then rejected by a Washington bureaucrat, causing Anderson considerable frustration. This disappointment, coupled with the death of his father in 1937, lingering bouts of both malaria and undulant fever, and the struggle to eke out a living with work he detested (manufacturing figurines) led to a mental breakdown, with psychotic episodes, in 1937. Oldfields In 1941, Anderson moved to Gautier, Mississippi, to live on his wife's father's estate (Oldfields) with his family. An extraordinarily productive period followed. Freed from his work at the Pottery, he had time to draw, paint and make block prints; to illustrate some of his favorite books; to experiment with theories of dynamic symmetry and with the drawing methods of the Mexican artist and educator Adolfo Best Maugard; and to translate from Spanish part of Jose Pijoan's history of art (probably without realizing that the work had already been translated into English). Horn Island The Oldfields period came to an end in 1945, when he left his family and moved back to a cottage at Shearwater. From then until his death in 1965 he lived a reclusive life, working as a decorator at the Pottery and making frequent excursions, in a rowboat sometimes rigged with a sail, from Ocean Springs to Horn Island, Mississippi where he lived in primitive conditions and portrayed the life around him - birds, sea creatures, animals, trees, landscapes - in radiant watercolors and in a series of logbooks. He also ventured abroad to Costa Rica and China, and made numerous bicycle trips, on some of which he traveled for thousands of miles. \\"The wheels are turning again\\", he once wrote. \\"A bicycle seems to leave no room for other evils, or goods for that matter. It is an inclusive and exclusive wheel.\\" One of his greatest works from this period is a series of murals in the Ocean Springs Community House. Along one wall, he painted the landing in Ocean Springs of the 17th-century French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville. Along the opposite wall he painted what he called the \\"Seven Climates,\\" in the sense of \\"a belt of the earth's surface contained between two given parallels of latitude.\\" The Gulf Coast‚ÄîOcean Springs in particular - is seen as a microcosm of these climates, each of which Anderson associates with a corresponding celestial body and with a season of the year: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon, beginning with Mercury and ending with Uranus. Anderson must also have been aware of the doctrine that the seven planetary spheres, with their different tones, produce a celestial music. Around the same time, Anderson painted murals along the wooden walls of a padlocked room in his cottage at Shearwater. These murals, now called the Shearwater Cottage Murals, were discovered after his death and are inspired by Psalm 104. It is a radiant hymn to light and to the beauty of one day on the Coast, beginning on the east wall with sunrise and continuing around the room through noon, sunset and night. Both murals may be seen at the 'Walter Anderson Museum of Art. When the Brooklyn Museum invited him to an exhibition of his linoleum block prints in 1948, he chose instead to travel to China, where he hoped to gaze upon unknown landscapes and examine Tibetan murals (the China trip ended, deep inland, when his passport and other belongings were stolen and Anderson returned, partly on foot, to his point of departure in Hong Kong.) Walter Anderson as a writer Among Anderson's most vivid writings are logbooks recording his travels by bicycle to New York City (1942), New Orleans (1943), Texas (1945), China (1949), Costa Rica (1951) and Florida (1960); an account of his life among the pelican colonies of North Key, in the Chandeleurs; and about 90 journals of his trips to Horn Island, off the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, in which he combines close observation of the natural world with reflection on art and nature. Another noteworthy log describes a walking tour to a colony of sand hill cranes north of Gautier, Mississippi in January 1944. After hurricane Katrina Anderson's work (his family's collection) was, partially destroyed when Hurricane Katrina struck Ocean Springs in 2005, and the storm surge penetrated the small cinderblock building that had been built after Hurricane Camille to house safely those of his works owned by his family. There was extensive water damage to the watercolors, drawings, manuscripts, and other objects that were kept there, and much of this work, from the Anderson Family collection, was dried and removed to Mississippi State University. Some has been restored by conservator Margaret Moreland. Further reading about Walter Anderson There is no complete catalogue either of Anderson's graphic work nor of his writing, and the compilation of such a volume acquires special urgency after Katrina. A checklist of surviving works -damaged and undamaged - would be a good first step. Major works by and about Anderson are listed below.

The band was composed of vocalist/guitarist John Bramwell, bassist Peter Jobson and drummer Andy Hargreaves. The band released six studio albums, and was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2010 for the album Sky at Night. The band split up in 2016, with Bramwell concentrating on a solo career. The origin of the band name was shrouded in secrecy for the majority of the band's existence, with Bramwell stating in 2013 that the band \\"never said and we never will\\" confirm the origin of the name and joked that \\"If I told you, I'd have to kill you\\". Jobson later claimed that the name I Am Kloot was inspired by the Alan J. Pakula film Klute, and also that \\"I Am Kloot is a left handed card game made famous in the diaries of Jerome K. Jerome\\" ‚Äì the rules of which are expounded in Jerome‚Äôs Three Men on the Bummel. History I Am Kloot were formed from the ashes of The Mouth, a band co-fronted by John Bramwell and Bryan Glancy. Bramwell, who was born and brought up in Hyde, Cheshire, had previously played with bands including The Face Brothers (a band he was kicked out at the age of 18), The Ignition, Five Go Off To Play Guitar and The Debuchias, and performed solo as Johnny Dangerously. Peter Jobson moved from Morpeth, Northumberland to Manchester to study at Salford College (where he graduated with a BA Hons in Popular Music and Recording) and befriended Bramwell at The Night and Day Caf√©, where they both ended up working for several years booking bands. Bramwell also ran an acoustic night at the venue called \\"Acoustica Mancunia\\" (and would continue hosting acoustic nights Gecko and Palookaville whilst the band got established). Jobson first saw Bramwell play at Castlefield Arena in central Manchester on 15 June 1996, the day of the IRA Bomb and ended up joining The Mouth who had released one single \\"Bang\\" the previous year, replacing the band's original bassist Simon Burns. The band split with Glancy after he went on holiday a week before a tour and didn't return for three weeks, began working on Bramwell's songs and changed their name to I Am Kloot. John Bramwell The band released their debut double A-Side single \\"Titanic/To You\\" in November 1999 on local label Ugly Man Records, which was advertised around Manchester city centre with posters bearing just the lyric \\"there's blood on your legs, I love you\\" daubed in red ink, leading to complaints in the local press. Guy Lovelady, the owner of Ugly Man Records had rung Bramwell about getting one of his acts to play Night and Day, but he refused to discuss it after having fallen out with the venues owner and instead sought to get the band's debut single released on the label. Lovelady agreed without hearing any material, and didn't actually hear the single until after it had been released and first saw the band play live two months later at The Kashmir Klub in London with The Libertines supporting. The band borrowed ¬£1,000 to release the single and packaged the records in brown paper bags instead of proper sleeves to save money. The band released their second double A-Side single \\"Twist/86 TV's\\" in March 2000 on Ugly Man before signing to Wall of Sound imprint \\"We Love You\\" to release their debut album Natural History in March 2001. Having decided against recording the album in the band's rehearsal space in Jobson's basement, it was recorded with Elbow frontman Guy Garvey in a church on the Isle of Mull. Despite being heralded by the NME as figureheads of the so-called New Acoustic Movement (although Bramwell didn't want to admit to there being an acoustic scene at the time \\"because of the labels that immediately get attached to ‚Äòacoustic music‚Äô\\"), the band returned home from touring to find the label had gone bust, owing the band money. The album went out of print in the UK, which Bramwell later described as a stalling moment for the band, but was still available in Europe due to it being distributed by a different label, so the band toured Holland, Germany and France instead of focusing on the UK. Following two years of contractual problems, the band signed to The Echo Label and released their self-titled second album I Am Kloot in September 2003 with Bramwell stating that the band didn't \\"fit into the current Strokes/White Stripes rock thing, so we're out on a limb again.\\" The album was produced by Chris Potter, with Ian Broudie producing one song, \\"Life in a Day\\". Despite originally planning to release \\"Proof\\" as a single to promote the album, going as far as approving artwork and track listing, as well as commissioning a promo video starring Christopher Eccleston, it ended up not receiving a commercial release in the UK. Instead, the promo video was made available through the band's website and only received a physical release in the Benelux countries on the PIAS record label. At the time, Bramwell claimed that the single wasn't released properly as they \\"didn‚Äôt want to do any singles any more\\", but later admitted that the record label refused to release it. The band released their third album Gods and Monsters in April 2005 via The Echo Label. The album was recorded at Moolah Rouge Studios in Stockport with Joe Robinson, who had previously worked with Badly Drawn Boy and Alfie. During sessions for the album, they placed microphones everywhere, commenting that they \\"were miking up things that were vibrating because we were playing. If you‚Äôve got a tabletop with cups and saucers on it, it might vibrate when you play a certain note, and not when you play others. So you mike up the tabletop, and play the song, and on certain notes you get these strange sounds\\" and added that they \\"kept it sparse, not layering it up so much as adding colour\\". Bramwell proclaimed that \\"something clicked in the last 12 months, I felt as if the band had just begun, as if we'd sprung from the head of Zeus in Full body armour\\", yet later claimed that he \\"got the shakes around Gods and Monsters. I was over-thinking, not going with my instincts writing-wise\\". In August 2005, the band parted ways with The Echo Label after it \\"became clear the label were unable to sustain the band's financial backing\\". It transpired that the label's parent company, the Chrysalis Group had announced a restructuring of The Echo Label after announcing a loss of over ¬£2.0 million, resulting in a change of direction at the label and dropping many of its roster including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and The Stands, with I Am Kloot jumping before they were pushed. On 21 November 2005, the band released the Guy Garvey/Craig Potter produced stand- alone single \\"Maybe I Should\\" via their own label, Skinny Dog Records. The single followed a short UK tour, which saw the band play their biggest headlining shows to date, culminating with a show at the London Astoria. Peter Jobson In October 2006, the band released BBC Radio 1 John Peel Sessions, a compilation of session tracks that were recorded for John Peel's BBC Radio One programme over two sessions in 2001 and 2004. Without a record deal, the band began work on their fourth album at Moolah Rouge Studios in early 2006, with Jobson describing the recording set up in May of that year as being \\"quite relaxed. When it feels right we record and hopefully that mood will pervade the album\\" and revealed that they were working with the studios owners Colin & Norman McLeod who also played live with the band, and added that \\"the atmosphere in the studio with them is inspiring\\". The band premiered several new songs at Manchester Academy in November 2006. However, these recordings were ditched in 2007, with the band choosing to record the songs over three days live in the studio with no overdubs, treating the recording as a gig. To reflect the live nature of the recordings, the album was released as I Am Kloot Play Moolah Rouge, initially as a limited edition hand numbered 2000 copy CD in November 2007 at three shows at Manchester Academy (the same venue where they previewed some of the songs a year previous), before receiving a full commercial release through Skinny Dog Records on 14 April 2008 with an additional DVD featuring a documentary on the band from the now defunct Channel M station. The album was dedicated to former bandmate and friend Bryan Glancy who died in January 2006, with Bramwell revealing that \\"lots of the lyrics on the album come from conversations with Bryan\\". Bramwell also commented that the band \\"might have returned to something that we had initially, which we all think is maybe quite a good idea\\". It was revealed in November 2008 that film director Danny Boyle, who had used the band's song \\"Avenue Of Hope\\" on the closing credits to his film Sunshine the previous year, had approached the band to develop an original musical with them. In October 2009, the band released a double album compilation of B-sides, rarities and previously unreleased songs under the title B. The band released their fifth album, Sky at Night on 5 July 2010 through Shepherd Moon Records/EMI Label Services. The album was originally intended to be released in Autumn 2009, with recording sessions having begun in January that year, but was delayed due to Moolah Rouge Studios going into liquidation and disrupting recording. Album sessions were finished at Blueprint Studios in Salford and produced by Craig Potter and Guy Garvey, with Bramwell shattering his elbow at Big Hands bar on Oxford Road, Manchester whilst celebrating completion of the album. Having taken 60 days in the studio to record over a 12-month period, with long gaps in between sessions, Bramwell revealed that taking so long to record the album had meant that they had been unable to tour and were \\"all skint because of it\\". The album resulted in \\"the greatest sales and acclaim\\" of the band's career, with Jobson noting that the album \\"was definitely where things went up a gear, in the UK at least. We got played on the radio, which had never happened before, and then to be nominated for the Mercury was massive for a band like us ‚Äì we‚Äôve always been about word of mouth\\" and admitting that prior to the album being released, that \\"after 10 years of gigging and working hard, we basically had nothing at all - no manager, label, money, we were pretty fucked up to be honest\\". Bramwell described the album as \\"a bit of a sidestep; a one-off, single-themed, late-night, romantic LP\\". The band released their sixth studio album, Let It All In on 21 January 2013, and was preceded by a live stream of the album on the Guardian website. Less orchestrated than Sky at Night, the album was recorded initially as a 3-piece, with the recordings finalised over 6 weeks with producers Garvey and Potter. On the song \\"Bullets\\" Bramwell can be heard singing with a lisp, initially claiming to have lost several teeth during a speedboat accident in the south of France, Bramwell later admitted that his teeth just started falling out. The album featured the eventual release of the song \\"Even The Stars\\", which was regularly played live prior to the release of I Am Kloot Play Moolah Rouge, but was omitted from that album. It was then set to feature on Sky At Night, with Bramwell stating that the song was \\"almost like a single. The thing with singles is they tend to not have all the Kloot elements in them because they‚Äôve got too poppy. But this song has got a real hook, it‚Äôs still got a lot of the soul and ghostliness that all Kloot songs should have\\", but was then omitted from that album too. The version eventually released is much slower than previous versions, with Bramwell admitting that the band had \\"tried recording it in many different ways; I think we‚Äôve finally found one that works in a Kloot way. There are some more exciting live versions of it that we‚Äôve done, but when we tried recording it previously it didn‚Äôt work\\". Andy Hargreaves In May 2013, the band announced their biggest headline show to date, which was held at the O2 Apollo Manchester venue in December 2013, and fans were asked by the band to submit song requests. In 2014, the band scored the incidental music for the BBC One television miniseries From There to Here, with the first episode aired 22 May. The soundtrack album will be released on 24 November 2014 on Caroline Records. The music was composed and recorded by the band members individually, with them not having seen each other since December 2013. In down time from the band, Jobson toured Europe with singer- songwriter Nadine Shah and Bramwell undertook a UK solo acoustic tour. In July 2014, Jobson revealed that the band's \\"last 2 albums have been very elaborate and our business set up has been very corporate. Although that has brought benefits it has also distracted us from what Kloot is about. Some of the most commercially successful things we have done have been artistically and personally the most unrewarding\\" and added that this period had \\"taken its toll on our relationship. We were doing something we didn¬¥t want to do. It took a while to find that out. We were pretty sick for a while there.\\" The band released the live album Hold Back the Night on 13 April 2015 via Walk Tall Recordings / PIAS. The band performed in June 2016 as part of the 'Guy Garvey's Cultural Meltdown' at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Prior to that, the band had not played or met up together for over 12 months. In November 2017, Bramwell revealed that the band had split up, stating that \\"There was no heavy break-up or anything. I just wanted to do something else. I'll never say never to getting back together but I was in I Am Kloot most of my adult life, but just as you can go to a great place on holiday year after year, sooner or later you want to go to somewhere else\\". He later added that \\"the real reason I‚Äôve gone solo is because I started as a finger-style classical and folk guitarist. It was great to be in a band, but at the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt really work in that format. It needs to be exposed\\". Post-split Bassist Pete Jobson now resides full time in London with his actor wife and his young family. Drummer Andy Hargreaves is currently playing live with singer-songwriter Matt Skinner. John Bramwell has been touring solo in the U.K. and Europe for the last two years. He released his solo album 'Leave Alone The Empty Spaces' in November 2017. Awards Sky at Night was shortlisted for the 2010 Barclaycard Mercury Music Prize. In response to the nomination, Bramwell stated: \\"I thought we'd be out of, off people's radar enough, that they wouldn't have, kind of, noticed. One of the factors why they actually did pay attention to this record is the fact that Guy [Garvey] and Craig [Potter] produced it.\\"  Discography  = Studio albums = * Natural History (2001) (#119 UK) * I Am Kloot (2003) (#68 UK) * Gods and Monsters (2005) (#74 UK, #200 FR) * I Am Kloot Play Moolah Rouge (2007) (#74 NL) * Sky at Night (2010) (#24 UK, #51 NL, #59 AT, #95 DE) * Let It All In (2013) (#10 UK, #37 NL, #45 AT, #49 DE, #61 BE-VLG, #143 BE-WAL) * From There to Here (2014, soundtrack) = Live albums = * Hold Back the Night (2015) = Compilations = * BBC Radio 1 John Peel Sessions (2006) * B (2009) = Singles = From Natural History * \\"To You\\"/\\"Titanic\\" (1999, Ugly Man, only 1000 vinyl copies released) * \\"Twist\\"/\\"86 TV's\\" (2000, Ugly Man, double A-side on CD and red vinyl) * \\"Dark Star\\" (2001, CD and vinyl) (#90 UK) * \\"Morning Rain\\" (2001, CD and vinyl) (#94 UK) From I Am Kloot * \\"Untitled #1\\" (2003, limited edition vinyl) (#101 UK) * \\"Life in a Day\\" (2003, 2√óCD and vinyl) (#43 UK * \\"3 Feet Tall\\" (2003, 2√óCD and vinyl) (#46 UK) * \\"From Your Favourite Sky\\" (2004, numbered CD and download) * \\"Proof\\" (2004, download) From Gods and Monsters * \\"Over My Shoulder\\" (2005, CD and 2√óvinyl) (#38 UK) * \\"I Believe\\" (download) From I Am Kloot Play Moolah Rouge * \\"Hey Little Bird\\" (2008, download) Non-album single * \\"Maybe I Should\\" (2005, limited CD, vinyl and download) (#128 UK) From Sky at Night * \\"Northern Skies\\"/\\"Lately\\" (2010, download)\\"Northern Skies/Lately Digital Multitrack Single Out Now on iTunes.

What's Up, Doc? was ranked number 61 on the list of the 100 greatest American comedies published by the American Film Institute (AFI), number 68 on the AFI's list of 100 greatest love stories in American cinema, and number 58 on the list of the WGA's 101 Funniest Screenplays published by the Writers Guild of America. The film was very loosely based on the novel A Glimpse of Tiger by Herman Raucher. Plot In the fictional Hotel Bristol in San Francisco, four parties arrive, each carrying identical plaid overnight bags. *The mysterious \\"Mr. Smith\\" is carrying top-secret government papers. There is at least some indication that he has them illegally and wishes to make them public, as a whistleblower. The equally mysterious \\"Mr. Jones\\" identifies himself as from the government, and is on a mission to recover the documents. *Dr. Howard Bannister is carrying a bag of igneous \\"tambula\\" rocks that have certain musical properties. Bannister, a musicologist from the Iowa Conservatory of Music, and his tightly wound, overbearing fianc√©e, Eunice Burns, have come to San Francisco to compete for a grant offered by Frederick Larrabee. Howard, who struggles to be patient with Eunice, has a theory that ancient man may have used rocks to create music. Howard's rival for the grant is the ethically challenged, dubiously-accented Hugh Simon, who is apparently from Yugoslavia but seems to be doing work in Western Europe. *Judy Maxwell's overnighter is filled with her clothing and a large dictionary. No matter where Judy goes, trouble happens, from car crashes to spontaneous combustion of hotel rooms. She never finished college, but nevertheless has amassed a considerable amount of knowledge from all of the courses she took at the many institutions of higher learning from which she was expelled. *Wealthy socialite Mrs. Van Hoskins has a bag containing her sizable collection of valuable jewels. Howard, Eunice, Mrs. Van Hoskins, and Mr. Smith all check into the Hotel Bristol at the same time. Judy, trying to score a free meal, lodges herself there without paying, notices Howard and begins pursuing him (to his bewilderment). Two hotel employees, Harry and Fritz, attempt to steal the jewels, while Mr. Jones attempts to retrieve Smith's bag. Over the course of the evening, the bags get switched haphazardly from room to room as the four parties unwittingly take one another's suitcases. Howard ends up with the jewels, Judy with the documents, Mr. Smith with Judy's clothes, and the thieves with the rocks. Meanwhile, Judy uses her humor, charm and academic knowledge to secure the grant for Howard, while masquerading as Eunice at the musicologists banquet hosted by Larrabee. She then indirectly contributes to the madcap destruction of Howard's hotel room (after Howard finds her taking a bubble bath in his tub, and Eunice suddenly appears). The following day (after Howard and Judy share a romantic moment), everyone makes their way to a party in the lobby of Larrabee's upscale Victorian home, where a major fight scene occurs involving guns, furnishings and thrown pies. Howard and Judy take all four bags and flee through San Francisco, first on a delivery bike, and then in a decorated Volkswagen Beetle stolen from a wedding party, pursued by the thieves, Mr. Smith, Mr. Jones, Eunice, Simon, Larrabee and a few roped-in bystanders. They go through Chinatown disrupting a parade, down winding Lombard Street, through wet cement, through a panel of glass, and eventually into San Francisco Bay at the ferry landing, after causing several collisions. All the protagonists finally end up in court, under the gavel of the world-weary, medication- dependent and curmudgeonly Judge Maxwell who turns out to be Judy's father. At the shock of seeing his daughter revealed to be the root of the trouble (she was hiding in a blanket during the proceeding), he leans on his heavily gaveled bench, which collapses under his weight. In the end, everything is cleared up: Howard gets his rocks back, Mrs. Van Hoskins pays the considerable damages in Howard's name with the reward money he would have received for the return of her jewels, the hotel thieves are forced to flee the country, and the papers are put back in the hands of the government. Judy exposes Simon as a fraud and plagiarist, thus getting Howard the grant. Eunice leaves Howard for Larrabee, and Judy announces she is making one more attempt at college, studying Music History at the Iowa Conservatory of Music with Bannister as her professor. Howard and Judy proclaim their love for one another, sharing an airborne kiss while their in-flight movie is the Bugs Bunny cartoon that gave the film its name. Cast *Barbra Streisand as Judy Maxwell *Ryan O'Neal as Howard Bannister *Madeline Kahn as Eunice Burns *Kenneth Mars as Hugh Simon *Austin Pendleton as Frederick Larrabee *Michael Murphy as Mr. Smith *Philip Roth as Mr. Jones *Sorrell Booke as Harry *Stefan Gierasch as Fritz *Mabel Albertson as Mrs. Van Hoskins *Liam Dunn as Judge Maxwell *John Hillerman as Hotel Manager Kaltenborn *George Morfogen as Rudy, Head Waiter *Graham Jarvis as Bailiff *Randy Quaid as Professor Hosquith *M. Emmet Walsh as Arresting Officer *Sylvester Stallone as Hotel Guest (uncredited) Production =Development and writing= =Filming= The opening and ending scenes were filmed at the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in the South Terminal (now Terminal 1). The opening scene was filmed in the downstairs TWA Baggage Claim area, and the next to last scene was filmed in the upstairs departure area beneath the arrival/departure board and at the flight insurance counter. The San Francisco Hilton was the shooting location for the Bristol Hotel. Part of the movie was filmed in Paramus, New Jersey. The exterior of the hotel, where Streisand is hanging from a ledge, was shot in Westwood, Los Angeles. The San Francisco setting was chosen to allow an elaborate comic spoof of the San Francisco car chase in the hit 1968 film Bullitt. Bogdanovich claims the rousing chase sequence accounted for one-fourth of the film's $4 million budget. The classic \\"plate glass\\" scene, in which O'Neal and Streisand are pedaling on a stolen grocery store delivery bicycle, was filmed at Balboa and 23rd Avenue in the Richmond District. In another scene, their out of control bike goes down Clay Street in Chinatown. The Volkswagen Beetle is stolen from the curb in front of Saint Peter and Paul Church at Washington Square Park, and the Beetle hides on a car carrier on Sacramento St. just west of Van Ness Avenue, in an area where many car dealerships were once located (Van Ness was San Francisco's \\"Auto Row\\"). The production did not have permission from the city to drive cars down the concrete steps in Alta Plaza Park in San Francisco; these were badly damaged during filming and still show the scars today. At the end of the car chase, almost everyone ends up foundering in San Francisco Bay‚Äîexcept O'Neal and Streisand, comfortably afloat in their Volkswagen Beetle. During the making of this scene, the actor Sorrell Booke almost drowned in the Bay. The final scene on board a TWA Boeing 707 shows O'Neal looking out the righthand window showing the Marina District and the Embarcadero Freeway. Music Although What's Up, Doc? is not a musical, it contains some singing and other musical interest. The song \\"You're The Top\\" from the musical Anything Goes is sung for the opening and closing credits by Streisand, and by Streisand and O'Neal, respectively. The same Cole Porter musical supplied at least two other tunes played as background music: \\"Anything Goes\\" and \\"I Get a Kick Out of You\\", heard during the first hotel- lobby scene. ‚ÄúFunicul√¨, Funicul√†‚Äù is whistled by the Streisand character as she crosses the street, following the pizza delivery man, into the Bristol Hotel before the first hotel lobby scene. About two-thirds of the way into the film, Howard accompanies Judy at a piano (on a floor of the Hotel Bristol apparently under construction or renovation) as she sings the beginning of \\"As Time Goes By\\" (made famous in the film Casablanca). The scene includes Streisand imitating Humphrey Bogart with the line, \\"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world....he walks into mine. Play it, Sam.\\" Musical in-jokes appear throughout the film. Over-the-top Muzak-styled elevator music featuring Cole Porter's songs is used throughout the hotel elevator scenes. In the chase scene, a Chinese marching band is inexplicably playing the Mexican tune \\"La Cucaracha\\" (although, in certain prints, it sounds more like \\"Deep in the Heart of Texas\\") on German glockenspiels. At the American Musicologists' banquet, themes from Thoinot Arbeau's Orch√©sographie can be heard in the background, incongruously played on a Hammond organ and a sitar. George Gershwin's \\"Someone to Watch over Me\\" is whistled by Streisand outside the hotel drug store. The Bugs Bunny number--derived from his characteristic tagline--that gives the movie its title appears as well, with the original animation, in the last scene. Instrumental versions of \\"Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone\\", an old Tin Pan Alley hit which had appeared in Looney Tunes cartoon One Froggy Evening, are background music during the opening scene in the airport. However, as with Bringing Up Baby, all the music is diegetic‚Äîthere is no underscoring anywhere in the film. Release =Home media= What's Up, Doc? was originally released on VHS in 1982. As part of a collectors' box set of Streisand's films, it was released on DVD in July 2003 and then on Blu-ray in August 2010. Reception =Box office= In North America, the movie grossed $66,000,000 against a budget of $4 million. It became the 3rd highest grossing film of the year, ranking behind The Godfather and The Poseidon Adventure. =Critical response= As of July 2020, the film held a \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating of 90% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 42 reviews, with the consensus: \\"Barbra Streisand was never more likable than in this energetic, often hilarious screwball farce from director Peter Bogdanovich.\\" In his review of What's Up Doc?, Critic John Simon said of Barbra Streisand: 'looks like a cross between an aardvark and an albino rat surmounted by a platinum-coated horse bun'. Simon called What's Up, Doc? a heavy handed attempt at nostalgia. The film was re-released in the United States in 1973 and earned an additional $3 million in theatrical rentals and in 1975 earning an additional $6 million. =Accolades= The film won the Writers Guild of America 1973 \\"Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen\\" award for writers Buck Henry, David Newman and Robert Benton. Madeline Kahn was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year ‚Äì Actress.

Career Williams was commissioned a captain in the Navy of Massachusetts and received command of the brig Hazard late in 1777. In the following year, he took her to sea in a fruitless search for British West Indiamen; but he and his ship eventually achieved success in 1779. While cruising in the West Indies, Hazard fell in with the privateer brigantine Active on 16 March. At the end of a \\"smart action\\" of 35-minutes' duration, \\"yard arm to yard arm,\\" Active struck her colors and became Hazard's prize, after having suffered 13 killed and 20 wounded out of her 95-man crew.Evans, p 9 Hazard sent the captured brigantine back to Massachusetts under a prize crew and subsequently returned home in April, after taking several other prizes. In May, Hazard returned to sea, this time in company with the brig Tyrannicide. At 0830 on 15 June, the two ships fell in with two British ships and‚Äîafter a short, sharp engagement‚Äîforced both enemy vessels to strike their colors. Later that summer, Hazard‚Äîlike the rest of the Massachusetts Navy‚Äîtook part in the ill-fated Penobscot expedition, an operation which eventually cost the state's navy all of its commissioned vessels. Williams received command of the new 20 gun frigate Protector in the spring of 1780 and took her to sea in June. In accordance with instructions from the Board of War, the new warship cruised in the vicinity of the Newfoundland Banks, on the lookout for British merchantmen. Her vigilance was rewarded early in June. At 0700 on 9 June 1780, Protector spotted a strange ship bearing down on her, flying British colors. At 1100, the Continental frigate, also flying English colors, hailed the stranger and found her to be the 32-gun letter-of-marque Admiral Duff, bound for London from St. Kitts. When the enemy's identity had been ascertained, Protector hauled down British colors and ran up the Continental flag‚Äîopening fire almost simultaneously. The action ensued for the next hour and one-half, until Admiral Duff caught fire and exploded, leaving 55 survivors for Protector to rescue soon thereafter. With the coming of peace, Williams returned to his native Boston.

The verses of alwars are compiled as Nalayira Divya Prabandham and the 108 temples are classified as Divya Desam. Nammalwar is considered the fifth in the line of the twelve alwars. He is highly regarded as a great mystic of the Vaishnava tradition. He is also considered the greatest among the twelve alwars and his contributions amount to 1352 among the 4000 stanzas in the Nalayira Divya Prabandam. According to traditional scriptures, Nammalwar was born in 3059 BCE in Alwarthirunagiri. In Hindu legend, Nammalwar remained speechless from his birth sitting in a tamarind tree and he first interacted with Madhurakavi Alvar, who saw a bright light shining to the south, and followed it until he reached the tree where the boy was residing. The works of Nammalwar were compiled by Madhurakavi as four different works, the Thiruvaimozhi (1102 verses), Thiruviruttam (100 verses), Thiruvaasiriam (or Thiru Aasiriyam - 7 verses) and Periya Thiruvanthadi (87 verses). The works of Nammalwar contributed to the philosophical and theological ideas of Vaishnavism. The Garudasevai festival in Nava Tirupathi, the nine Vishnu temples in Thoothukudi region and the Araiyar Sevai during the Vaikunta Ekadesi festival in Srirangam temple are dedicated to him. The verses of Nammalwar and other alwars are recited as a part of daily prayers and during festive occasions in most Vishnu temples in South India. Alwars left The word alwar means the one who dives deep into the ocean of the countless attributes of god. The Alwars are considered the twelve supreme devotees of Vishnu who were instrumental in popularising Vaishnavism. The religious works of these saints in Tamil, songs of love and devotion, are compiled as Nalayira Divya Prabandham containing 4000 verses and the 108 temples revered in their songs are classified as Divya Desam.Dalal 2011, pp. 20-21 The saints had different origins and belonged to different castes. As per tradition, the first three alwars, Poigai Azhwar, Bhoothath Azhwar and Pey Azhwar were born miraculously. Thirumalisai Alvar was the son of a sage, Thondaradippodi Alvar, Madhurakavi Alvar, Periyalvar and Andal were from the Brahmin community, Kulashekhara Alwar a kshatriya, Nammalwar a Vellala, Thiruppaan Alvar a paanar and Thirumangai Alvar a kallar. The Divya Suri Charitra by Garuda-Vahana Pandita (11th century), Guruparamparaprabhavam by Pinbaragiya Perumal Jiyar, Periya tiru mudi adaivu by Anbillai Kandadiappan, Yatindra Pranava Prabavam by Pillai Lokacharya, commentaries on Divya Prabandam, Guru Parampara (lineage of Gurus) texts, temple records and inscriptions give a detailed account of the alwars and their works. According to these texts, the saints were considered incarnations of some form of Vishnu. Poigai is considered an incarnation of Panchajanya (Krishna's conch), Bhoothath of Kaumodakee (Vishnu's Mace/Club), Pey of Nandaka (Vishnu's sword), Thirumalisai of Sudarshanam (Vishnu's discus), Namm of Vishvaksena (Vishnu's commander), Madhurakavi of Vainatheya (Vishnu's eagle, Garuda), Kulasekhara of Kaustubha (Vishnu's necklace), Periya of Garuda (Vishnu's eagle), Andal of Bhoodevi (Vishnu's wife, Lakshmi, in her form as Bhudevi), Thondaradippodi of Vanamaalai (Vishnu's garland), Thiruppaan of Srivatsa (An auspicious mark on Vishnu's chest) and Thirumangai of Sharanga, Rama's bow. The songs of Prabandam are regularly sung in all the Vishnu temples of South India daily and also during festivals. According to a traditional account by Manavala Mamunigal, the first three alwars, namely Poigai, Bhoothath and Pey, belong to the Dvapara Yuga (before 4200 BC). It is widely accepted by tradition and historians that the trio are the earliest among the twelve alwars. The alwars were also instrumental in promoting the Bhagavatha cult and the two epics of India, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.B.S. 2011, p. 42 The alwars were instrumental in spreading Vaishnavism throughout the region.B.S. 2011, pp. 47-48 The verses of the various alwars were compiled by Nathamuni (824-924 AD), a 10th-century Vaishnava theologian, who called it the \\"Tamil Veda\\". Sri nammalvar-Subbiah kumara valai Early life According to traditional scriptures, Nammalwar was born on the 43rd Kali in 3059 BC. He was born at Thirukurukur (modern day Alwarthirunagiri) in the southernmost region of the Tamil country. Some sources consider his to have been a princely family, although of shudra status (To prove world that \\"caste is not based on birth and it is based on action\\").Ramanujan 2005, p. xi Tradition says that he must have been born fully enlightened because as a baby he never cried or suckled and never opened his eyes. According to legend, as a child he responded to no external stimuli and his parents left him at the feet of the deity of Sri Adhinathar in Alwarthirunagari. The child then got up and climbed into a hole in a tamarind, sat in the lotus position, and began to meditate. It appears he was in this state for as long as sixteen years when a Tamil poet and scholar in named Madhurakavi Alvar was born in Thirukolur and had travelled to North India on a temple trip. As he was performing his Nitya Anushtanam one day, he saw a bright light shining to the south, and followed it until he reached the tree where the boy was residing. Unable to elicit any reaction from the child, he asked him a riddle: \\"If the small is born in a dead's body (or stomach), what will it eat and where will it stay?\\" meaning, if the subtle soul is embodied in the gross body, what are its actions and thoughts? Nammalwar broke his lifelong silence and responded, \\"That it will eat, it will rest!\\" meaning that if the soul identifies with the body, it will be the body but if it serves the divine, it will stay in Vaikunta and eat(think) of God. Madhurakavi Alvar realized the divinity of this child. It is believed that in the Kali yuga, the doors of Vaikunta (the supreme abode of Lord Vishnu) was opened first time for him by Narayana himself and it is believed that the followers of Swami Nammalwar have the most easy access to the supreme abode. Following his moksha his family entitle as the Subbiah Kumara Pillai by holy Vaishnava acharyas and they serve him and believe him to be Sriman Narayana Tiruvadi. Nammalwar was one of the twelve alwar poet-saints who immersed themselves in a love of Vishnu and who had a considerable knowledge of ancient Tamil literature and its variants of traditional stories concerning Vishnu and his associates, as well as the philosophical differences between Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. Madhurakavi Alvar was his first disciple. Swami Madhurakavi Alvar composed 11 pasurams in praise of his Acharya, Swami Nammalwar known as Kanninun Siruthambu, which are included among the Nalayira Divya Prabandham. Swami Nammaalwar with Madhurakavi Alwar and Nathamunigal Work He contributed four pieces of works to Divya Prabhandham. These works consisted of 1,296 poems, making him the most prolific contributor to the 4,000 hymns written by the Alvar poet-saints. These works are: *Thiruvaymozhi (1102 verses) *Thiruviruttam (100 verses) *Thiru Vaasiriam (7 verses) *Periya Thiruvanthadi (87 verses) Tiruvaymoli describes Ranganatha as a metaphor for discussing the philosophical details in *The nature of the paramatma (divine soul) *The nature of the jeevatma (living soul) *The means for the jeevatma (living soul) to attain the goal of Paramatma (divine soul) *The blocks and hurdles on the way and *The goal moksha (divinity). In the Srivaishnava canon, these four represent (in Tamil language) the four Sanskrit vedas, respectively, the Sama Veda, Rig Veda, Yajur Veda and Atharva Veda. According to tradition \\"He poured the cream of these vedas\\" into his songs and poetry that were the result of deep mystic experience. Though Nammalwar did not visit any of the 108 divyadesam temples talked about in the Vaishnava religion, it appears from his works he must have had the vision of all the archa forms in the temples he glorified in his hymns.Das 2005, p. 29 Style of composition The distinction of Nammalwar with his contemporaries is above the devotional aspects in writing, the visualization and dramatic movement. He mentions Vishnu in various aspects frequently in all his verses. The poems of Tiruvirrutam are depicted fully between the lone context of the hero and heroine. Most of these are utterances of the hero, heroine, her friends to the heroine or her mother to the heroine. The heroine always perceives his hero, Vishnu everywhere around her. As per Varadachari, Tiruviruttam is \\"an account of the pilgrimage of the soul to its transcendence over its ignorance, sleep and sloth in which it is caught up in the body\\". While the medieval poetry is considered self-pity and repentance, his works always have a message of hope.Das 2005, pp. 41-44 Culture Nammalwar is regarded as the one of the top three Hindu mystics in India, with the other two being Manickavasagar and Kabir. Nammalwar is considered greatest among the twelve alwars and his contributions amount to 1352 among the 4000 stanzas in the Nalayira Divya Prabandam. The Garuda Sevai utsavam (festival) in the month of Vaikasi(May- Jun) witnesses nine Garudasevai, an event in which festival image idols from the nava tirupathis temples namely, Mayakoothar Temple, Makara Nedunkuzhai Kannan Temple, Rettai Tirupathi - South Temple, Rettai Tirupathi North Temple, Vaithamanidhi Perumal Temple, Adhinaatha Perumal Temple - Thirukkurugur, Kaaisinavendhan Temple, Vijayaasana Perumal Temple, Sri Vaikuntanatha(Kallapiran) Temple are brought on Garuda vahana. The festival image of Nammalvar is also brought in Anna Vahanam (palanquin) and his verses dedicated to each of these nine temples are recited. The utsavar of Nammalvar is taken in a palanquin to each of the nine temples, through the paddy fields in the area. The verses dedicated to each of the nine Divyadesams are chanted in the respective shrines. It is the most important of the festivals in this area, and it draws thousands of visitors. Pagal Pathu(10 day time) and Ra Pathu(10 day night time) festival are celebrated in the month of Margazhi(December‚ÄìJanuary) for twenty days in Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam. The first ten days are referred as Pagal-Pathu (10 day day festival) and the second half as Ra Pathu(10 day night time festival). The first day of Ra pathu is Vaikunta Ekadashi. The eleventh day of each fortnight in Tamil calendar is called ekadesi and the holiest of all ekadasis in the Vaishnava tradition is the Vaikunta Ekadashi. Nammalwar, one of the 12 alwars, is believed to have ascended to vaikuntam(the heavenly abode of Vishnu) on this day. The devotion of the 9th-century poet, Nammalwar, and his perceived ascent to heaven are enacted annually. During the festival, through song and dance, this place is affirmed to be Bhoologa Vaikunta(heaven on earth). Araiyar Sevai is a divine colloquim of araiyars, who recite and enact Nalayara Divya Prabanda, the 4000 verses of alwars (Vaishnavite poets of the 7th‚Äì10th century). Araiyars are born to Araiyar tradition most prevalent in Sri Vaishnava families in Srirangam, Alwar Thirunagari and Srivilliputhur. The tradition of Araiyar Sevai was started by Nathamuni, a 10th-century Vaishnavite who compiled the works of alwars. It is believed as per Hindu mythology that 330 million demi-gods came down to witness the event. The festival deity is brought to the 1000-pillared hall on the morning of Vaikunta Ekadashi through the Paramapada Vasal (gate to paradise). Lakhs of pilgrims rush to enter it after the gate is opened and the deity passes through it as it is believed that one who enters here will reach vaikuntam (heaven) after death. The gate is open only during the ten days of Ra Pathu (10 days of night time festival). On the last day of the festival, the poet Nammalwar is said to be given salvation. The performance is enacted by priests and images in the temple depicts Nammalwar as reaching heaven and getting liberation from the cycle of life and death. At that point, a member from the crowd of devotees, who are witnessing this passion play, goes up to the centre stage and requests Vishnu to return Nammalwar to humanity, so that his words and form in the temple will continue to inspire and save the devotees. Following this performance of the salvation of Nammalwar, the cantors are taken in procession round the temple.

He was also active in opposing the creation of a hog farm in the village of Sarsfield part of the Cumberland Ward of Ottawa. Provincial politics In the provincial election of 2003, he defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Brian Coburn in Ottawa‚ÄîOrleans by about 4500 votes. He was named a government whip on October 23, 2003. In July 2006, McNeely described Israel as a \\"rogue state\\", arguing that Israel's military campaign in Lebanon was resulting in collective punishment for the Lebanese people. Dalton McGuinty expressed \\"serious dismay and disappointment\\" for these remarks, and McNeely later offered an apology for the language of his comments. He was re-elected to the provincial legislature in 2007, beating Conservative candidate Graham Fox by almost 9,000 votes. In the 2011 election he was re-elected with a margin of 2,854 votes. In 2005, McNeely proposed an amendment to a no smoking bill that would ban power wall cigarette advertising from convenience stores and retail businesses. The \\"McNeely Amendment\\", which came into effect on May 31, 2008, has helped keep cigarettes out of the sight of children. During his time in office, McNeely has served as Parliamentary Assistant to a number of ministers including Minister of Transportation, Minister of Health and Long Term Care and most recently as PA to the Minister of the Environment. In 2014, McNeely announced that he would not seek re-election in the 2014 contest. =Electoral record= References External links * Category:1932 births Category:Alumni of Imperial College London Category:Living people Category:McGill University alumni Category:Ontario Liberal Party MPPs Category:Ottawa city councillors Category:21st-century Canadian politicians ","title":"Phil McNeely"},{"id":"1159879","text":"Kinnaur is one of the twelve administrative districts of the state of Himachal Pradesh in northern India. The district is divided into three administrative areas - Pooh, Kalpa, and Nichar (Bhabanagar), and has six tehsils (counties). The administrative headquarters of the district is at Reckong Peo. The mountain peak of Kinnaur Kailash is found in this district. As of 2011, it is the second least populous district of Himachal Pradesh (out of 12 districts), after Lahaul and Spiti. General Kinnaur, is about from the state capital, Shimla, located in the northeast corner of Himachal Pradesh bordering Tibet to the east. It has three high mountains ranges, namely, Zanskar and Himalayas that enclose valleys of Sutlej, Spiti, Baspa and their tributaries. The slopes are covered with thick wood, orchards, fields and hamlets. At the peak of Kinnaur Kailash mountain is a natural rock Shivling (Shiva lingam). The district was opened to outsiders in 1989. The old Hindustan-Tibet Road passes through the Kinnaur valley along the bank of river Sutlej and finally enters Tibet at Shipki La pass.Kinnaur is the second richest district in terms of per capita income after Solan in Himachal Pradesh. History Kinnaur was a part of erstwhile Chini Tehsil of Mahasu district. It became a separate district on 1 May 1960. Kinnaur was a part of the erstwhile Bushahr principality which had its capital at Kamru. Later, the capital was shifted to Rampur Bushahr. After the fall of the Kannauj Empire the rulers of Kamru annexed adjoining territories by force and laid the foundation of the state of Bushahr, to which the region of Kinnaur belonged till the dissolution of the state after independence of India. In the absence of authentic historical records the early history of the Kinnaur region is obscure and the reference of the Kinnaur or Kannaura and their land is by and large confined to legends and mythological accounts. Kinnaur also has historical cultural links with Ngari Prefecture of the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Religion and Culture Festivals of Kinnaur 1\\\\. Saazo - January 2\\\\. Fagul or Holi - March 3\\\\.

It is known for the Kinnaur Kailash, a mountain sacred to Hindus, close to the Tibetan border. = Climate = Hindustan-Tibet Highway in Kinnaur Kinner Kailash in 1980 Most of Kinnaur enjoys a temperate climate due to its high elevation, with long winters from October to May, and short summers from June to September. The lower parts of the Sutlej Valley and the Baspa Valley receive monsoon rains. The Baspa valley receives highest rainfall in July month. The upper areas of the valleys fall mainly in the rain-shadow area. These areas are considered to be arid regions, similar to the climate of Tibet and Central Asian countries study by the IIT Delhi in 2016 established that Kinnaur district has the cleanest air in the country  Flora and fauna  Portions of Kinnaur are situated high in the Himalaya, where vegetation is sparse and consists primarily of hardy grasses. Alpine species such as juniper, pine, fir, cypress, and rhododendron can be found at elevations between 3,500 and 5,000 metres, primarily in Middle Kinnaur. At lower altitudes, temperate-climate trees are found, including oak, chestnut, maple, birch, alder, magnolia, apple, and apricot. Yaks and dzos are reared by local farmers in the higher areas. Scattered populations of the Himalayan black bear and small ponies may also be found. Demographics According to the 2011 census Kinnaur district has a population of 84,121.

He died in June 1863 on board his ship USS Albatross while taking part in the Union attempt to blockade the Mississippi River. He is best known for the unusual circumstances of his burial in Louisiana, which the town of St. Francisville, Louisiana, commemorates every year in a three-day festival called \\"The Day the War Stopped.\\" Early life Hart was born in 1824 in New York City to a family with 200-year roots there. His father was Benjamin Franklin Hart and his mother was Sarah Ann Copp. The family had a strong Navy tradition. His grandfather John Elliot Copp, for whom he was named, and his uncle Ezekiel Bishop Hart were both killed serving in the Navy during the War of 1812. He moved to Schenectady, New York in the 1850s, and in 1855 he married Harriet \\"Hattie\\" Van Vorst, the mayor's daughter. They had one surviving child, Abraham Elliot Hart, as well as a son and daughter who died in infancy. In 1857 he joined the local Masonic lodge and rose to the rank of Master. Naval career Hart was appointed a midshipman in the Navy on February 2, 1841. He served in the Brazil Squadron aboard USS Marion and USS John Adams, and in 1846 he circumnavigated the globe aboard USS Constitution. In late 1846 he was admitted to the newly opened United States Naval Academy and graduated as a Passed Midshipman in the class of 1847. He served on various ships including USS St. Lawrence, USS Michigan, and USS Jamestown. While serving on Jamestown he was promoted to Lieutenant. He took a leave of absence in the late 1850s, then served in the Mediterranean aboard USS Iroquois. Following the outbreak of the Civil War he served aboard USS Vincennes, and was part of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron on the Mississippi River under Admiral David Farragut. He was appointed a Lieutenant Commander on July 16, 1862. In August 1862 he was transferred to the gunship USS Albatross, and in October 1862 he was put in command of Albatross when the captain was relieved of his post. The Albatross and other ships engaged two Confederate steamers in the Red River near Fort DeRussey on May 4, 1863. It was later claimed that Albatross had shelled St. Francisville under Hart's command, but no such incident can be found in the ship's log, and the historic shelling of St. Francisville actually took place in January 1864, six months after his death. Death and burial In June 1863, while Albatross was stationed above Port Hudson, Louisiana, he contracted yellow fever. A few days later he became delusional, and on June 11, 1863, he committed suicide in his cabin with his own revolver. He was officially listed as \\"killed in battle.\\" His officers were unable to send his body home to Schenectady for burial, and knowing he would wish a Masonic burial, Executive Officer Theodore B. Dubois went ashore under a flag of truce to ask if there were any Masons in the area who would conduct a funeral. They were put in contact with Confederate Army Captain William Walter Leake, a company commander with the 1st Louisiana Cavalry, who was home on furlough. Leake was Senior Warden of Feliciana Lodge No. 31 in the nearby town of St. Francisville, and he made arrangements for Hart to be buried at Grace Episcopal Church there. A truce was arranged so that the Union officers could bring his body ashore, attend the funeral, and return to their ship to resume their blockade. A joint party of Union and Confederate officers, all Masons, participated in the funeral on June 12, 1863. The pastor of Grace Church, Rev. Daniel S. Lewis, conducted an Episcopal service, and Leake as acting Master of the lodge led the Masonic service. Leake, who later became Master of the St. Francisville lodge, maintained Hart's grave and decorated it with flowers for the next 49 years, until his own death in 1912. Leake was buried near Hart, and the two former enemies are commemorated with a single marble slab, placed in 1955 by the Grand Lodge of the State of Louisiana and \\"dedicated to the universality of Freemasonry.\\" In 1906 Hart's son Abraham Elliot Hart, who had been 7 when his father died, learned from his mother about his father's burial by a Confederate officer. The son, who went by the name A. Elliot Hart,Letter from A. Elliot Hart to William W. Leake, August 25, 1096, and W. W. Leake to A. Ellot Hart, September 2, 1096, cited in Pe√±a, The Day the War Stopped,, 2008 wrote to Leake, who still lived in St. Francisville, to thank him for his service to his fallen father. He said he had only then learned about it and that Leake's kindness had made a profound impression on him. Frank Karwowski, the historian of the Masonic lodge in Schenectady, became interested in the story and began researching it. In 1999 he and the St. Francisville lodge cooperated in staging a reenactment of the truce and burial, billed as \\"The Day the War Stopped;\\" the tradition has been continued annually in June ever since. It is now a three-day festival with lectures and a parade in addition to the re- enactments. Karwowski himself plays Hart for a talk on Friday night and Hart's second-in-command Dubois for the funeral re-enactment on Saturday. Members of the St. Francisville lodge portray Leake; past portrayers have included a U.S. Congressman and Leake's great-great-grandson. During the 2000s Karwowski began to contact descendants of Hart and Leake, inviting them to attend the re- enactment weekend, and several have done so, particularly in 2013 for the 150th anniversary of the event.

He and John Childe (his steward and tithe proctor) were both tried and executed for buggery in 1640. Life and death = Early life and education = Atherton was born in 1598 in Somerset, England. His father was a parson. He studied at Oxford University and joined the ranks of the Anglican clergy. = Career in the Anglican clergy = In 1630, he became prebendary of the Church of St. John the Evangelist in Dublin, chancellor of the Anglican Diocese of Killaloe in 1634, chancellor of Christ Church Cathedral and rector of Killaban and Ballintubride in 1635. In 1636, under the patronage of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, he became Bishop of Waterford and Lismore in the Church of Ireland under the protests of the Roman Catholic majority in his see. After the Buggery Act 1533 was found in 1631, during the Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven case, to not apply to Ireland, Atherton pushed for the enactment of \\"An Act for the Punishment for the Vice Of Buggery\\" in 1634. = Downfall = In 1640 Atherton was accused of buggery with a man, John Childe, his steward and tithe proctor. Even though his fellow clerics attempted to prevent his trial to save the reputation of his Church, they were the first to have been tried under the law that Atherton himself had helped to institute. They were found guilty and both condemned to death, to the applause of the crowd, with Atherton being nearly lynched on his way to prison at Cork; Atherton was executed by hanging in Stephen's Green, Dublin, after reading the morning service for his cellmates. Reportedly, he confessed about the crime to the priest ministering him immediately before his execution, although he had proclaimed his innocence before that and kept doing so during the execution. Atherton was ironically the first to be executed for buggery in Ireland under the law he pushed to enact.  Legacy  = Character assassination and conspiracy = Since 1710, some historical evidence has been developed that shows Atherton might have been a victim of a conspiracy to discredit him and his patrons. This was attributable to Atherton's status as an astute lawyer, who sought to recover lost land for the relatively weak Protestant Church of Ireland during the 1630s. Unfortunately for Atherton, this alienated him from large landowners, who then allegedly used his sexuality to discredit him. The conspiracy has been alleged to have been led by a lawyer named Butler, over land in Killoges, near Waterfeld. Butler became insane after the execution, claiming to see Atherton at all time. English Puritan, Congregationalist and Independent activists, as well as English and Scottish Presbyterian activists, contemporaneously campaigned to abolish Episcopacy (bishops) within the embattled Church of England, Church of Scotland and Church of Ireland; notionally expediting the political interest in Atherton's downfall.Bray, Alan (1982) Homosexuality in Renaissance England London: Gay Men's Press Posthumous accusations of sexual wrongdoing also include allegations of \\"incest\\" with his sister-in-law, and infanticide of the resultant child, as well as zoophilia with cattle. However, these allegations began to be circulated several months after his death in an anonymous pamphlet, and may have been intended to further discredit the bishop's campaign to restore the finances of the Church of Ireland. = Legends = A legend had him linked to the Old Mother Leakey, a Somerset ghost accused of shipwrecking. Another legend describes the house of Butler, the lawyer who allegedly led the conspiracy against Atherton, as being haunted by the ghost of the bishop.

History The regiment was formed in 1999 by the amalgamation of the 3rd Battalion, The Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire (Yorkshire Volunteers), the 3rd Battalion, the Duke of Wellington's Regiment (Yorkshire Volunteers) and the King's Own Yorkshire Yeomanry (Light Infantry) due to the reforms implemented in consequence of the Strategic Defence Review. The regimental headquarters was at Pontefract and the regiment, part of 15 (North East) Brigade, comprised one small Headquarter Company and five Rifle Companies: *Waterloo Company - formerly Headquarter Company *Minden (Light Infantry) Company *Quebec (Prince of Wales's Own) Company *Imphal (Prince of Wales's Own) Company *Ypres (Duke of Wellington's) Company *Fontenay (Duke of Wellington's) Company No new cap badge was created for this regiment, soldiers wore their former regimental cap badge or were badged according to the company they joined. Headquarter Company was a composite company with TA posts initially allocated proportionally by cap badge - 20% LI/40% PWO/40% DWR. Subsequently all new Headquarter Company recruits were badged Light Infantry or by trade. The regimental crest was a combination of the Light Infantry and the Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire cap badges and crest from the Duke of Wellington's Regiment. During the summer of 2004 the regiment adopted a single Tactical Recognition Flash (TRF) of the White Rose of Yorkshire on a black background (this design was previously used by the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division between the First and early in the Second World War). The official Army abbreviation for the regiment was \\"E and WRR\\". In November 2004, the regiment dispatched a composite company (Normandy Company) to Basra, Iraq as part of 4th Mechanized Brigade of the Multi-National Division (South East) for a 6-month tour-of- duty.

It was produced at TechTV (later G4) and aired from May 26, 2003 to December 2004. The show was set as a traditional late night talk show, including a couch for guests to sit during interviews, with subject matter including unusual guests scooped up from the Internet, Sargent's reported binge drinking adventures, and pornography. Cast and format Martin Sargent served as the show's always irreverent host. Sargent's sidekick was stand-up comedian Laura Swisher. The mislabeled Joey the Intern rounded out the triumvirate. Other regular characters featured included former child star Gary Coleman (of Diff'rent Strokes), Big Missy (Martin's alleged girlfriend whom he met online, created and written by show writer and frequent on-air character actor Stewart Engesser), Rael of the Ralien movement who claimed the 1st false prophet under the illuminati God Amon Re. Later, writer Stewart Engesser starred as the funnyman parody of real legendary actor Michael Caine, a role he continues to play occasionally on Martin's podcast, Infected. In early episodes, the show also highlighted regulars such as Scary Gary, who showed grotesque segments such as a skin-implemented cellphone, and The Porn Mom, a stay-at-home mom character who provided segments dealing with finding quality pornography on the Internet. One of the more famous events on the show was Sargent's interview with George Ouzounian, better known as Maddox, creator of the website The Best Page in the Universe. Production and broadcast The show was originally taped in San Francisco, California at the TechTV studios but later transferred to Los Angeles following the sale of the network by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures to the Comcast owned G4, a gaming oriented network. The executive producer of the show was Paul Block. Much like The Screen Savers from 2002‚Äì2004, it was taped in front of a live studio audience at TechTV Studio B. However, this show was taped in advance. At TechTV, the show normally taped two episodes on Tuesday and two on Thursday and at G4, the show normally taped one episode a day from Monday- Thursday. Tapings in San Francisco concluded with the September 8, 2004 episode. The first Los Angeles-based episode of the show was taped on September 7, 2004, and aired 6 days later. Sargent officially dismissed the Unscrewed Army (a term he used in reference of the shows viewers) on the final episode of Unscrewed with Martin Sargent, which was recorded in Studio 3 at the G4techTV studios on November 10, 2004. Fans speculated that this episode would never be televised due to its non-stop explicit bashing of G4 and Comcast. Surprisingly, G4techTV aired the episode twice, although the network reported to the programming guides that it was to air the prior year's Christmas episode instead. On November 11, 2004, the show was officially cancelled and the majority of its staff was terminated. Reruns were shown on G4techTV until December 2004. On November 11, 2005, Sargent launched Infected, a podcast hosted by himself and Joey. The podcast focuses on the humorous and weird side of technology and the Internet, making the show somewhat of a successor to Unscrewed.

Lightning is depicted around the rising column of ash and gas. Plinian eruptions or Vesuvian eruptions are volcanic eruptions marked by their similarity to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, which destroyed the ancient Roman cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii. The eruption was described in a letter written by Pliny the Younger, after the death of his uncle Pliny the Elder. Plinian/Vesuvian eruptions are marked by columns of volcanic debris and hot gases ejected high into the stratosphere, the second layer of Earth's atmosphere. The key characteristics are ejection of large amount of pumice and very powerful continuous gas-driven eruptions. According to the Volcanic Explosivity Index, Plinian eruptions have a VEI of 4, 5 or 6, sub-Plinian 3 or 4, and ultra-Plinian 6, 7 or 8. Short eruptions can end in less than a day, but longer events can continue for several days or months. The longer eruptions begin with production of clouds of volcanic ash, sometimes with pyroclastic surges. The amount of magma erupted can be so large that it depletes the magma chamber below, causing the top of the volcano to collapse, resulting in a caldera. Fine ash and pulverized pumice can deposit over large areas. Plinian eruptions are often accompanied by loud noises, such as those generated by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. The sudden discharge of electrical charges accumulated in the air around the ascending column of volcanic ashes also often causes lightning strikes as depicted by the English geologist George Julius Poulett Scrope in his painting of 1822. The lava is usually dacitic or rhyolitic, rich in silica. Basaltic, low-silica lavas are unusual for Plinian eruptions; is the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera on New Zealand's North Island. Pliny's description A Stone Pine, the type of tree used by Pliny to describe the eruption. April 21, 1990 eruption cloud from Redoubt Volcano as viewed to the west from the Kenai Peninsula (more than 60 km from the volcano's summit) Pliny described his uncle's involvement from the first observation of the eruption: Pliny the Elder set out to rescue the victims from their perilous position on the shore of the Bay of Naples, and launched his galleys, crossing the bay to Stabiae (near the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia). Pliny the Younger provided an account of his death, and suggested that he collapsed and died through inhaling poisonous gases emitted from the volcano.

Background and rise to the throne  Geungusu was the eldest son of the 13th king Geunchogo, and father to the 15th king Chimnyu and the 16th king Jinsa. In 369, as crown prince, Geungusu led the Baekje armies against invading troops of the northern Korean kingdom Goguryeo, capturing 5,000 prisoners. He pushed on to Pyongyang and Sugok-seong in 371, killing Goguryeo's king Gogugwon in battle. He continued his father's policies, and his father's alliance with the Jin clan. His chief minister, Jin Godo (ÁúûÈ´òÈÅì), was the father of his queen, Lady Ai (ÈòøÂ∞íÂ§´‰∫∫).  Reign  During Geungusu's reign, Baekje was in hostile relations with its northern neighbor, Goguryeo, because of Baekje's attacks on Pyongyang, and the murder of a Goguryeo king during one of the battles. He continued these hostilities as king, taking Pyongyang in 377 with 30,000 men. Had he pushed onto Goguryeo, which was still under turmoil with Gogugwon's death, then Baekje would have completed the conquest of Goguryeo. Baekje continued as the military and economic power it was during his father's reign. Geungusu maintained friendly relations with China and Yamato period Japan. He is recorded in the Nihonshoki as having sent the noted Baekje scholar Wang In to Japan with copies of the Analects of Confucius and one copy of the Thousand Character Classic. However, on the basis of Korean accounts some believe that this took place decades later, in the reign of King Asin. There were several astonishing weather- related events during his reign, such as the raining dirt incident in 379. A severe drought in 382 also showed the king's love for his people, as he opened up the kingdom's food storages and fed the people. Samguk Sagi: \\"King Geungusu was also called Hwisu. Geungusu was the son of King Geunchogo. Previously, Sayu, king of Goguryeo, himself came and invaded. King Geunchogo dispatched the crown prince to repel them, and he reached Bangeolyang and was goiung to give battle. A man from Goguryeo called Sagi, who was originally a man from Baekje and had mistakenly injured the hoof of the king's steed, feared punishment and fled to Goguryeo. Returning to Baekje at this time, he told the crown prince, \\"Their soldiers are many, but all of their numbers are meant to deceive you. The only valiant troops are the ones with the red banners ‚Äî if you first break them, the other troops will not attack and flee of their own accord.\\" The crown prince followed his advice, and attacked and put them to a great rout, and he pursued them to the north, reaching all the way to the northwest of the fortress of Sugok. Geneal Makgohae then admonished him, saying \\"I have heard the taoists say, \\"Know when you have enough, and you will not be humiliated. Know when to stop, and you will not put yourself in danger. Now we have gained much: why do we need to seek more?\\" The prince thought it good and stopped, and raised a mound of rocks as a memorium. Then he climbed to the top of it and said to those around him, \\"After today, who will again come to this place?\\" The earth there is full of cliffs and rocks, and cracked like the hoof of a horse. Other people, up to the present, stil call this place \\"the hoofprints of the crown prince.\\" Geunchogo died in the 30th year of his reign, and Geungusu succeeded him.\\" * 376 AD, The king's uncle on his mother's side, Jin Godo, was made Minister of the Interior.

Landscape with the Judgement of Paris, in Mannerist world landscape style. Gillis van Coninxloo (now also referred to as Gillis van Coninxloo II but previously referred to as Gillis van Coninxloo III) (24 January 1544 ‚Äì January 1607) was a Flemish painter of landscapes who played an important role in the development of Northern landscape art at the turn of the 17th century. He spent the last 20 years of his life abroad, first in Germany and later in the Dutch Republic.Gillis van Coninxloo at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life He was born in Antwerp and studied under Pieter Coecke van Aelst, Lenaert Kroes and Gillis Mostaert. He travelled in France after completing his training. He became a member of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1570 and worked in Antwerp until 1585 when Antwerp fell to the Spanish. He left first for Middelburg and then in 1587 for Frankenthal where he was active until 1595. He then moved to Amsterdam where he died in 1607. He had many pupils including Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Govert Govertsz van Arnhem, Willem van den Bundel, Gillis van Coninxloo III, Jonas van Merle, Hercules Seghers and Jacques van der Wijen. Work Forest Landscape, 1598, Liechtenstein Collection Coninxloo ranks as one of the most important Flemish landscape painters of around the turn of the 17th century. He exercised a strong influence on Jan Brueghel the Elder, Pieter Schoubroeck, Roelandt Savery, and other Flemish and Dutch landscape painters of this period. His early landscapes were often Northern Mannerist versions of the established world landscape type, though with close views of trees already narrowing the panoramic view. Beginning in the 1590s Coninxloo introduced a new approach into Flemish landscape painting, with close-up views of forests reminiscent of Albrecht Altdorfer and the Danube school nearly a century earlier and almost or entirely shutting out a distant view. While earlier forest landscapes had used forests as the backdrop for human activity, van Coninxloo turned them into the subject proper by submerging tiny human figures in elaborate compositions of trees on a hugely exaggerated scale. A Forest Landscape of 1598 in the Liechtenstein Collection is the first work to take this approach to its extreme: the sky is only visible in a few patches between branches and a single tiny human figure reclines under a tree.Vlieghe, 175-176 This painting achieves great intensity and atmospheric quality through its fine shades of brown and green and its accentuated handling of light.Gillis van Coninxloo, Forest Landscape, 1598, at the Liechtenstein Collection During his stay in Frankenthal from 1588 to 1595, he influenced several better known Flemish √©migr√© landscape painters, who are now collectively referred to as the 'Frankenthal School'. The early 17th century art historian Karel van Mander wrote about Coninxloo in his Schilder-boeck. Van Mander stated that Coninxloo's teacher Pieter Coeke van Aelst was his cousin, and that I know at this time of no better landscape painter, and I notice that they are following his manner very much in Holland. The influence of his work spread in Holland by means of his designs for large-scale prints, mainly engraved by Flemish √©migr√© printmakers Nicolaes de Bruyn and Jan van Londerseel who published in the Dutch Republic.Larry Silver, Peasant Scenes and Landscapes: The Rise of Pictorial Genres in the Antwerp Art Market, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012, pp. 164‚Äì165 Works Some of his paintings are: * \\"The Judgment of Midas\\" (Dresden) * \\"Latona\\" (Hermitage, St. Petersburg) * \\"Landscape with Venus and Adonis\\" (Frankenthal) * \\"Landscape with Duck Hunters\\" (Saarland Museum, Saarbr√ºcken) Notes References *Sutton, Peter C., ed.

Description Spiraea tomentosa grows to up to four feet high and prefers moist to wet soil and full sun. It blooms in summer. Each tiny, pink flower is about 1/16 of an inch wide and arranged in narrow, pyramid-shaped flowerheads that grow up to eight inches long. The flowers are followed by small, dry, brown fruit. The specific epithet tomentosa refers to the undersides of the leaves and the stems, which are covered in a dense white- woolly tomentum. It has similar characteristics to Spiraea douglasii.

It runs from Griffith Park in Los Angeles east through Glendale, the Eagle Rock section of Los Angeles, Pasadena, and Arcadia, ending in Monrovia. The full route was once various state highways but is now locally maintained in favor of the parallel Ventura Freeway (SR 134) and Foothill Freeway (I-210). Route description =West end= Colorado Street crosses the Los Angeles River in Atwater Village at its western terminus Colorado Street begins at Interstate 5 (Golden State Freeway) as a short freeway spur, originally carrying State Route 134 until it was moved north onto the Ventura Freeway. After crossing the Los Angeles River, there are two interchanges‚Äîwith Edenhurst Avenue and San Fernando Road‚Äîbefore it becomes a surface street. At the second interchange it enters Glendale. At the east border of Glendale, Colorado Street becomes Colorado Boulevard as it crosses State Route 2 (Glendale Freeway) into Los Angeles (specifically, the neighborhood of Eagle Rock). Another short freeway spur splits west of the intersection with Figueroa Street, heading northeast to the Ventura Freeway. This spur also carried SR 134 after the Ventura Freeway was built to the east but before it was built west of the split with the spur. After crossing Figueroa Street, Colorado Boulevard splits from Linda Vista Avenue and then passes over the Arroyo Seco on the Colorado Street Bridge into Pasadena. =Through Pasadena= Colorado Street Bridge seen from the Arroyo Seco below In Pasadena, Colorado Boulevard crosses the short State Route 710 spur and forms the north end of State Route 110 (Arroyo Parkway). Colorado Street, renamed \\"Boulevard\\" in 1958, runs through Old Town Pasadena from Arroyo Parkway to Orange Grove Boulevard. It is the north‚Äìsouth zero axis of the street grid in Pasadena (the east‚Äìwest axis is Fair Oaks Avenue). The Tournament of Roses parade route travels north on Orange Grove Avenue then east along Colorado Boulevard as far as Sierra Madre Boulevard, where it heads north to Victory Park. Most major Pasadena attractions are found along or within one block of Colorado Boulevard. Pasadena City College is located at 1570 E. Colorado Boulevard. The street was mentioned in Jan and Dean's 1964 hit song The Little Old Lady from Pasadena. The road leaves the city into unincorporated East Pasadena, where it intersects Rosemead Boulevard (Former State Route 19), all while formerly signed as California State Route 248. =Through Arcadia and Monrovia= Colorado Boulevard becomes Colorado Street as it crosses Michillinda Avenue from East Pasadena into Arcadia. Through Arcadia, the street parallels the Foothill Freeway, providing access to many of the neighborhoods in west Arcadia; freeway access is provided via a separated interchange with Baldwin Avenue. Colorado Street then turns southeast and splits into two streets--Colorado Boulevard, which continues east, and Colorado Place, a short segment of old US 66 that goes southeast to merge with Huntington Drive near the Santa Anita Racetrack. From the split, Colorado Boulevard (originally named Orange Street) becomes a primarily residential street, with some commercial zones near Santa Anita Avenue in Arcadia. The street passes under the Foothill Freeway between First and Second Streets in Arcadia with no access, in front of Monrovia High School, and through Old Town Monrovia before ending at Shamrock Avenue at Recreation Park in Monrovia. (This segment of Shamrock Avenue was once part of an early alignment of US 66 and had been named Foothill Boulevard.) The Santa Anita Depot, built in 1890 to serve Lucky Baldwin, and the people of Rancho Santa Anita, was located at Colorado Boulevard and Old Ranch Road. It was moved to the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden during the construction of the 210 Foothill Freeway in 1970. History Colorado Boulevard in 1890, then named Colorado Street. Looking east to Marengo Avenue. Horse-drawn wagons displaying America flags, maybe a 4th of July parade. 1890 Horse-drawn streetcar on Colorado Street and Oakland in Pasadena The most original portion of Colorado Boulevard ran from Orange Grove Boulevard to Broadway, now Arroyo Parkway. This portion of the street always contained many shops, banks, hotels, and major commercial industries. By the late 19th century, this part of Colorado had become so popular, it was becoming a traffic bottleneck, and as early as May 1900 there were public outcries to the City Council to widen the road. It wasn't until 1929 that the City undertook the major and unprecedented task of cutting back the buildings along Colorado on each side. This undertaking created a monumental amount of legal red tape as well as many engineering dilemmas which were handled with amazing results. At the same time many of the Victorian facings on the buildings were replaced with Spanish and Art Deco designs. Colorado Street and Colorado Boulevard carried pre-1964 Legislative Route 161 from its west end to the merge with Huntington Drive (via Colorado Place). This was signed as State Route 134 west of Figueroa Street, U.S. Route 66 Alternate (US 66 before the end of 1940) from Figueroa Street to Arroyo Parkway, and U.S. Route 66 from Arroyo Parkway to Huntington Drive. In 1954, the Colorado Freeway was opened between Holly Street in Pasadena and Eagle Vista Drive and Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock to help alleviate traffic congestion due to the narrow Colorado Street Bridge over the Arroyo Seco. The new freeway connected the two communities until 1971, when the entire freeway was closed and upgraded, as well as partially rerouted as the new Ventura Freeway. A short segment of the original Colorado Freeway remains as an on- ramp/off-ramp between Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock and the Figueroa Street off-ramp of the present Ventura Freeway. In the 1964 renumbering, LR 161 remained State Route 134 west of Pasadena, though this was being moved to the new alignment (now the Ventura Freeway); until the freeway was completed through Pasadena in the mid-1970s, Colorado Boulevard was still signed as State Route 134 between Orange Grove Avenue and Arroyo Parkway. Through and east of Pasadena, LR 161 became State Route 248, but was signed as US 66 and continued east on Huntington Drive to the interchange with Interstate 210 (Foothill Freeway) in Monrovia. In 1965, this was to be deleted when I-210 was completed. The US 66 shields began to come down along the length of Route 248 in 1975, soon after Interstate 210 was completed through Pasadena. SR 248 was never signed as such, though it did appear on some maps in the 1970s and 1980s. The segment within the city of Pasadena was deleted from the state highway system in 1986. The rest was removed in 1992. Along with the moving of SR 134 to the Ventura Freeway, this resulted in Colorado Street and Colorado Boulevard becoming a local road. Transit Colorado Boulevard is served by several bus routes, operated by Metro and suburban systems. Metro Local lines 180 and 181 and Metro Rapid line 780 serve most of Colorado Boulevard, running between Hollywood and Pasadena. Also, Metro Local lines 177, 256, 686, and Foothill Transit line 187 serve parts of Colorado Boulevard, beginning in Old Pasadena. Metro Local lines 28, 81, and LADOT DASH Eagle Rock/Highland park serves most of Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock. Metro Local Lines 28, 183 and Glendale Transit line 6 serve Colorado Street in Glendale. Controversies Metro has identified Colorado Boulevard as a potential bus rapid transit corridor, part of a line between North Hollywood station and Pasadena approved in 2016's Measure M. The bus rapid transit project would need to include removable components to allow for the annual staging of the Rose Parade. Some local residents fear increased traffic congestion due to the proposed bus rapid transit route, while others support increasing access to high-quality transit. In popular culture The road was mentioned in the 1964 Jan & Dean single The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena) as the \\"little old lady\\" is the terror of Colorado Boulevard.

Triglycerides are emulsified by bile and hydrolyzed by the enzyme lipase, resulting in a mixture of fatty acids, di- and monoglycerides. These then pass from the intestinal lumen into the enterocyte, where they are re-esterified to form triglyceride. The triglyceride is then combined with phospholipids, cholesterol ester, and apolipoprotein B48 to form chylomicrons. These chylomicrons then pass into the lacteals, forming a milky substance known as chyle. The lacteals merge to form larger lymphatic vessels that transport the chyle to the thoracic duct where it is emptied into the bloodstream at the subclavian vein. At this point, the fats are in the bloodstream in the form of chylomicrons. Once in the blood, chylomicrons are subject to delipidation by lipoprotein lipase. Eventually, enough lipid has been lost and additional apolipoproteins gained, that the resulting particle (now referred to as a chylomicron remnant) can be taken up by the liver. From the liver, the fat released from chylomicron remnants can be re-exported to the blood as the triglyceride component of very low-density lipoproteins. Very low-density lipoproteins are also subject to delipidation by vascular lipoprotein lipase, and deliver fats to tissues throughout the body. In particular, the released fatty acids can be stored in adipose cells as triglycerides. As triglycerides are lost from very low-density lipoproteins, the lipoprotein particles become smaller and denser (since protein is denser than lipid) and ultimately become low-density lipoproteins. LDL particles are thought to be atherogenic. Note that in contrast to any other route of absorption from the small intestine, the lymphatic system avoids first pass metabolism.

It is in the local government area of the City of Darebin. It is 4 or 5 km from Melbourne's central business district, just north of Clifton Hill, and a few hundred metres south of the main part of Northcote. Merri Creek forms its western border, and to the east lies Fairfield. Westgarth is part of Northcote for administrative purposes, although it retains its own geographically distinct commercial centre.  History  Melbourne in 1888. Westgarth is the southern part of Northcote Westgarth High Street, 2004; pavements were changed to black asphalt in 2006 Westgarth Cinema, 2004 Terra Madre organic store and therapies shop, formerly Fruit Pedallers, 2004 Before European occupation, the area was home to the Wurundjeri people. Land c.2 km to the south, where Merri Creek meets the Yarra, was an early site of colonial contact, briefly home to the Native Police Corps in 1842, and a school for Aboriginal children until 1851. The precise location of the signing of Batman's Treaty, an 1835 agreement between an early colonizer John Batman and Wurundjeri elders to cede land to him, is unknown but thought to be at the western end of Cunningham Street on the banks of the Merri Creek. Land sales first occurred in the Northcote area in 1840, and land was purchased in the area then known as Northcote-by-the- Merri (now Westgarth) but not immediately developed. Three of the buyers later had streets named after them - Cunningham, Urquhart and Walker. As Northcote, Victoria developed in the mid-to-late 19th century, Northcote-by-the-Merri became known as Northcote South1. Land was gazetted for development in 1853, but development was relatively slow. All Saints Anglican church on High Street Westgarth dates to 1860 (present building, 1870), and the Bridge Hotel to 1864. Westgarth's development accelerated - along with that of many other Melbourne suburbs - in the economic boom of the 1880s. As the children of the Gold Rush generation formed their own families, Melbourne's population swelled. The Victorian Parliament reacted by using railway lines to open up new housing areas. The railway line from Clifton Hill to Alphington was opened in 1884, and the railway station was linked to Melbourne via a western loop in 1888. A cable tram line down High Street to Clifton Hill was opened in 1886, faltered after the land market collapse of 1892, and opened and closed again until reopening permanently in 1901. Building continued through the Edwardian era and into the 1920s, and in 1925 the Northcote tram (now route 86) was connected right through to the city centre. In 1913 the Northcote South Ratepayer's Association gained permission to install two redundant 12 ton cannons from the 1880s facing south to North Fitzroy (built by W.G. Armstrong and Co. of Newcastle-on-Tyne, UK) and they are still in place.http://heritage.darebinlibraries.vic.gov.au/article/381 The present commercial and shopping strip along High St. dates to the early 20th century, and Westgarth Primary School to 1925, when it opened as Westgarth Central School. The suburb won its present name between 1906 and 1910, with the decision to name the railway station after William Westgarth. The art nouveau Westgarth Theatre, the suburb's best-known landmark, opened in 1920. The 1960s and 1970s saw an influx of southern European immigrants to the area, in common with other City of Darebin suburbs. By the 1970s the Westgarth Theatre catered largely to a Greek-speaking cinema audience. Westgarth school photos and class lists from the 1970s are dominated by Greek names and faces. That influence began to fade in the 1980s, with the arrival of a new generation of Westgarth residents with higher incomes and education levels. The process of gentrification accelerated through the 1990s, fuelled by the suburb's central location, attractive streets and housing stock, and its proximity to pricier inner-city suburbs including Fitzroy, Clifton Hill and North Fitzroy. The Westgarth Theatre became an art-house movie venue in 1986 when the Valhalla Cinema relocated there after the demolition of its original premises in Richmond. Ten years later, it became the Westgarth Cinema, now part of the Palace Group. A number of industrial buildings along High St. were converted to residential use in the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century. Westgarth Primary School's original building was demolished in 1990 and replaced by an open-plan building, extended in 2011. World War II A partially excavated tunnel and bunker is located in Westgarth on the north bank of Merri Creek about 30 metres downstream from where a trail crosses the stream near the southwest corner of Oldis Gardens and East Street. The tunnel entrance is locked and it is reported that it lies under a high pressure gas pipeline.  Westgarth today  The Merri Footbridge over the Merri Creek, Westgarth/Fitzroy North Today, WestgarthThe term \\"Northcote South\\" is beginning to come back into use by local real estate agents. retains its southern European presence, with many children of the 1960s and 1970s immigrant wave still living in the area. But Westgarth also houses a wide variety of other cultural and language groups. Gentrification has brought back some of the children of Melbourne residents who moved to middle and outer suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s. The area is now known for its local artists, and a lesbian community has also been associated with Westgarth for some years. The best-known local resident was the Australian actor Vince Colosimo (believed now moved). The Westgarth Cinema remains the centre of the small commercial strip at the southern end of High Street, which is now populated by bohemian fashion outlets, but mainly cafes, restaurants and a few other retail businesses. The strip remains noticeably less developed than its counterparts in Clifton Hill and Fairfield, arguably due in part to the traffic intensity of the relatively narrow High Street. New development has been rare, although new businesses open every few months and apartments above shops were constructed in 2009, again in 2011 and in 2020. The lack of local shops means most Westgarth residents currently travel to other suburbs for groceries and many other needs. Retaining the \\"village\\" feel of Westgarth, against mounting commercial pressures to redevelop Victorian heritage buildings and development sites, was the aim of the now-defunct \\"Save Westgarth Village\\" campaign. The Westgarth Cinema was one of the last two remaining single-screen venues in Melbourne, until being redeveloped in 2006. After several years of uncertainty about its commercial survival, the family owners finally sold it to Palace Cinemas in 2005, while retaining ownership of the building. Although many original features have been preserved, it is now a popular multiplex with a 300-seat cinema downstairs and now four smaller cinemas upstairs. The train line through Westgarth station is now part of the Hurstbridge line, following an easterly route into the city. A second, proximate station on the Mernda line, Rushall, is accessed via a pedestrian and cyclist bridge over the Merri Creek (the bridge connects through to an east‚Äìwest cycle route along Linear Park, one of the nicest such parks in Melbourne). The High Street tram line is now part of Melbourne tram route 86. Upgrading the tram line occurred in 2011, with three stops reduced to two in Westgarth and increased dangers to cyclists and pedestrians close to the relocated central stop. The tram changes are noted in Council consultation and in many media articles and community campaigns. In August 2013, in the last phase of the tram works, metal sculptures designed by Syrinx Environmental were added to the new median strip, producing a local outcry on social media and featuring in the national press. The Council voted to remove them again after 3 weeks. The Jika Jika Community centre on Plant Street is the main meeting place for local events and activities. Education Westgarth Primary School, 2006 Westgarth Primary School is the area's main school, although Merri Creek, Fairfield and Spensley Street Schools are closer by distance for many Westgarth residents. Westgarth Primary was founded in 1924 as Westgarth Central School, Number 4177 in the Victorian system. Originally Primary to Year 8, it eventually became primary- only. It now caters to approximately 650 students in grades from preparatory to year six. It has two campuses, Clarke St (for Grade 3-6 students), and Brooke St (for students in years Prep-2). It has a kindergarten attached to the Clarke St campus. It is one of the biggest primary schools in the region and is currently seeking government funding to redevelop its facilities to cater for significant growth in student numbers. Westgarth Primary School runs code club, robotics and other Technology workshops.  References  * Ellender, Isabel and Peter Christiansen (1999), People of the Merri Merri.

Though modified more than once since the reign of Ivan III (1462‚Äì1505), the current coat of arms is directly derived from its medieval original, with the double-headed eagle having Byzantine and earlier antecedents from long before the emergence of any Russian state. The general tincture corresponds to the early fifteenth-century standard. The shape of the eagle can be traced back to the reign of Peter the Great (1682‚Äì1725), although the eagle charge on the present coat of arms is golden rather than the traditional, imperial black. Description and usage The two main elements of Russian state symbols (the two-headed eagle and the mounted figure slaying the dragon) predate Peter the Great.

Today, the imperial crowns on each head stand for the unity and sovereignty of Russia, both as a whole and in its constituent republics and regions. The orb and scepter grasped in the eagle's talons are traditional heraldic symbols of sovereign power and authority. They have been retained in the modern Russian arms despite the fact that the Russian Federation is not a monarchy, which led to objections by the Communists even though both the blue ribbon and the collar of the Order of St. Andrew (which in the imperial arms supported the three crowns and surrounded the central shield) have been removed from the current coat of arms. It appears on the federal buildings and is on the cover of the national passport. The Standard of the President of Russia is a squared Russian tricolour defaced with the coat of arms of Russia, the banner of the Russian Armed Forces also has the coat of arms centered on the obverse side. Some state awards of Russia are also designed based on the coat of arms, including the State Prize. The Russian Ruble coins depicting the coat of arms on the obverse side since 2016. Historical versions The heraldic device of Russia has gone through three major periods in its history, undergoing major changes in the transitions between the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation. The use of the double-headed eagle as a Russian coat of arms goes back to the 15th century. With the fall of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, the Grand Dukes of Muscovy came to see themselves as the successors of the Byzantine heritage, a notion reinforced by the marriage of Ivan III to Sophia Paleologue (hence the expression \\"Third Rome\\" for Moscow and, by extension, for the whole of Imperial Russia). Ivan adopted the golden Byzantine double-headed eagle in his seal, first documented in 1472, marking his direct claim to the Roman imperial heritage and posing as a sovereign equal and rival to the Holy Roman Empire. In 1497, it was stamped on a charter of share and allotment of independent princes' possessions. At about the same time, the image of a gilt, double-headed eagle on a red background appeared on the walls of the Palace of Facets in the Moscow Kremlin. The other main Russian coat of arms, the image of St George slaying the dragon, is contemporaneous. In its first form, as a rider armed with a spear, it is found in the seal of Vasili I of Moscow in 1390. At the time of Ivan III, the dragon was added, but the final association with Saint George was not made until 1730, when it was described as such in an Imperial decree. Eventually, St George became the patron saint of Moscow (and, by extension, of Russia). After the assumption of the title of Tsar by Ivan IV, the two coats are found combined, with the eagle bearing an escutcheon depicting St George on the breast. With the establishment of the Moscow Patriarchate in 1589, a patriarchal cross was added for a time between the heads of the eagle. =1721‚Äì1917: Russian Empire= The Russian Empire had a coat of arms, displayed in either its greater, middle and lesser version. Its escutcheon was golden with a black two-headed eagle crowned with two imperial crowns, over which the same third crown, enlarged, with two flying ends of the ribbon of the Order of Saint Andrew. The State Eagle held a golden scepter and golden globus cruciger. On the chest of the eagle there was an escutcheon with the arms of Moscow, depicting Saint George, mounted and defeating the dragon. After approval by Alexander III on 24 July 1882, the greater coat of arms was adopted on 3 November, replacing the previous 1857 version. Its central element is the coat of arms, crowned with the helmet of Alexander Nevsky, with black and golden mantling, and flanked by the archangels Michael and Gabriel. The collar of the Order of Saint Andrew is suspended from the coat of arms. The whole lies within a golden ermine mantle, crowned by the Imperial Crown of Russia and decorated with black double-headed eagles. The inscription on the canopy reads: –°—ä –ù–∞–º–∏ –ë–æ–≥—ä (\\"God is with us\\"). Above the canopy stands the state khorugv, of gold cloth, on which is depicted the Medium State Seal. The banner is topped by the State Eagle. Around the central composition are placed fifteen coats of arms of the various territories of the Russian Empire. Nine of these are crowned and placed on a laurel and oak wreath. Proceeding from the left in a counter-clockwise direction, these represent, as they are included in the full imperial title: the Khanate of Kazan, the Kingdom of Poland, Tauric Chersonesos, the unified coat of arms of the Grand Principalities of Kiev, Vladimir and Novgorod, the dynastic arms of the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov, the Grand Principality of Finland, the Georgian principalities, and the Khanates of Siberia and Astrakhan. The six upper escutcheons are joint depictions of various smaller principalities and oblasts. From the left in a clockwise fashion, these are: the combined arms of the northeastern regions (Perm, Volga Bulgaria, Vyatka, Kondinsky, Obdorsk), of Belorussia and Lithuania (Lithuania, Bia≈Çystok, Samogitia, Polatsk, Vitebsk, Mstislavl), the provinces of Great Russia proper (Pskov, Smolensk, Tver, Nizhniy-Novgorod, Ryazan, Rostov, Yaroslavl, Belozersk, Udorsky), the arms of the southwestern regions (Volhyn, Podolsk, Chernigov), the Baltic provinces (Estonia, Courland and Semigalia, Karelia, Livonia) and Turkestan. The Middle Coat of Arms (–°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–∏–π –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –≥–µ—Ä–± –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏–∏) is similar to the Great Coat of Arms, excluding the khorugv and the six upper escutcheons. The Abbreviated Imperial Title is inscribed over the perimeter of the Seal. The Lesser Coat of Arms (–ú–∞–ª—ã–π –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –≥–µ—Ä–± –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏–∏) depicts the imperial double-headed eagle, as used in the coat of arms, with the addition of the collar of the Order of Saint Andrew around the escutcheon of St. George, and the Arms of Astrakhan, Siberia, Georgia, Finland, Kiev-Vladimir-Novgorod, Taurica, Poland and Kazan on the wings (seen clockwise). In the beginning of the 17th century, with the ascension of the Romanov dynasty and its contacts with Western Europe, the image of the eagle changed. In 1625, for the first time the double-headed eagle appeared with three crowns. Traditionally, the latter have alternatively been interpreted as representing the conquered kingdoms of Kazan, Astrakhan and Siberia, as stated in the first edict concerning the state seal, on 14 December 1667, or as standing for the unity of Great Russia (Russia), Little Russia (the Ukraine) and White Russia (Belarus). Probably under influence from its German equivalent, the eagle, from 1654 onwards, was designed with spread wings and holding a scepter and orb in its claws. During the reign of Peter the Great, further changes were made. The collar of the newly established Order of Saint Andrew was added around the central escutcheon, and the crowns were changed to the imperial pattern after his assumption of the imperial title in 1721. At about this time, the eagle's color was changed from golden to black, which would be retained until the fall of the Russian monarchy in 1917. A final form for the eagle was adopted by imperial decree in 1729, and remained virtually unchanged until 1853. During the early 19th century, the eagle designs diversified, and two different variants were adopted by Emperor Nicholas I. The first type represented the eagle with spread wings, one crown, with an image of St.George on the breast and with a wreath and a thunderbolt in its claws. The second type followed the 1730 pattern, with the addition of the arms of Kazan, Astrakhan and Siberia on its left wing and those of Poland, the Taurica and Finland on the right one. In 1855‚Äì57, in the course of a general heraldic reform, the eagle's appearance was changed, mirroring German patterns, while St George was made to look to the left, in accordance with the rules of Western heraldry. At the same time, the full set of coat of arms of Great, Medium and Minor Arms, was laid down and approved. The final revisions and changes were made in 1882‚Äì83, and are those described above. =1918‚Äì93: Soviet and post-Soviet Russia= The coat of arms of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was adopted on 10 July 1918 by the government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Soviet Union), and modified several times afterwards. It shows wheat as the symbol of agriculture, a rising sun for the future of the Russian nation, the red star (the RSFSR was the last Soviet Republic to include the star in its state emblem, in 1978) as well as the hammer and sickle for the victory of Communism and the \\"world-wide socialist community of states\\". The Soviet Union state motto (\\"Workers of the world, unite!\\") in Russian ( ‚Äî ''''') is also a part of the coat of arms. The acronym of the RSFSR' is shown above the hammer and sickle, and reads , for \\"\\" (). Similar emblems were used by the Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republics (ASSR) within the Russian SFSR; the main differences were generally the use of the republic's acronym and the presence of the motto in the language(s) of the titular nations (with the exception of the state emblem of the Dagestan ASSR, which had the motto in eleven languages as there is no single Dagestani language). The Soviet Union as a whole adopted its emblem in 1923, which remained in use until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Although it is technically an emblem rather than a coat of arms, since it does not follow traditional heraldic rules, in Russian it is called (), the word used for a traditional coat of arms. It was the first state insignia created in the style known as socialist heraldry, a style also seen in e.g. the Chinese national emblem. The emblem shows the Soviet emblems of the Hammer and Sickle and the Red Star over a globe, in the center of a wreath wrapped in ribbons emblazoned with the Soviet motto (\\"Workers of the world, unite!\\") in the official languages of the Soviet Republics, in the reverse order they were mentioned in the Soviet Constitution. Each Soviet Republic (SSR) and Autonomous Soviet Republic (ASSR) had its own coat of arms, largely inspired by the state emblem of the Union. Four versions were used: 6 ribbons were used in 1923, which were written on in Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Georgian, Armenian, and Azerbaijani; 11 ribbons with the addition of Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik, Kazakh, Kyrgyz; 16 with the addition of Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Moldavian, and Finnish. Finally, the inscriptions in Azerbaijani, Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik, Kazakh and Kyrgyz were updated to reflect their transition from the Latin to the Cyrillic script. The final version of the emblem was adopted in 1956 with the removal of the Finnish inscription from the insignia, reflecting the 1956 transformation of the Karelo-Finnish SSR into the Karelian ASSR. In 1992, the inscription was changed from RSFSR () to the Russian Federation () in connection with the change of the name of the state.The law of the Russian Federation from 21 April 1992 ‚Ññ 2708-I ¬´About changes and additions of the Constitution (Basic law) of the Russian SFSR¬ª In 1993, president Boris Yeltsin signed a decree to replace the Communist design by the present coat of arms. =Evolution= File:Seal of Ivan 3 (reverse).svg1472: Seal of Ivan III File:Seal-of-Ivan-4 1539 a.svg1539: Seal of Ivan IV File:Russian coa 1589 grozny.png1589: Seal of Ivan IV File:Russian-coa-1667.png1667: Coat of arms of the Tsardom of Russia File:Russian COA 1796 a.jpg1800: Imperial coat of arms under Paul I File:Russian Empire-Full coat of arms.3.jpg1800: Greater coat of arms File:Russian COA 1825‚Äî55 B.jpg1825: First variant of Nicholas I's coat of arms File:Russian COA 1825‚Äî55 A.jpg1830: Second variant of the coat of arms File:Russian greaterarms.png1882: Greater coat of arms File:Lesser Coat of Arms of Russian Empire.svg1883: Lesser coat of arms File:Russian coa 1917.svg1917: Provisional coat of arms File:Coat of arms of the Russian Republic 1917.svg1917: Republican coat of arms File:Coat of arms of the Kolchak government (unofficial).png1919: Coat of arms during the Civil War File:Coat of Arms of the Russian Federation 2.svg1993: Modern coat of arms File:Digital gerb russia max.svg2017: Digital coat of arms (bigger version) File:Digital gerb russia.svg2017: Digital coat of arms (smaller version) See also * Armorial of Russia * Coat of arms of Moscow * Coat of arms of Saint Petersburg * Russian heraldry * Flag of Russia References External links * Heraldry of the Russian Empire * The Code of Principal Laws of the Russian Empire (–°–≤–æ–¥ –û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã—Ö –ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω–æ–≤, 1906) Russia Category:National symbols of Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia ","title":"Coat of arms of Russia"},{"id":"1160025","text":"Streak or streaking may refer to: *Streaking, running naked in a public place *Streaking or surfactant leaching in acrylic paints *Streaking (microbiology), a method of purifying micro-organisms *Streak (mineralogy), the color left by a mineral dragged across a rough surface *Streak (moth), in the family Geometridae *Streak (film), a 2008 film *Winning streak, consecutive wins in sport or gambling **Losing streak **The Streak (wrestling), a run of victories for The Undertaker at WrestleMania **The Streak (Easton High School Wrestling), a Pennsylvania, US, high-school streak *Iron man (sports streak), an athlete of unusual physical endurance *Hitting streak, in baseball, a consecutive amount of games in which a player appears and gets at least one base hit. *Dell Streak, tablet computer by Dell *Streak camera, device to measure short optical pulses *\\"The Streak\\", a 1974 record by Ray Stevens *Archenteron, an indentation on a blastula *Heath Streak, former Zimbabwe cricket team captain *Streak, a late 1940s single engine civilian aircraft *Streak (company) is a private American company founded in 2011 and based in San Francisco, California See also * Streaker (disambiguation) ","title":"Streak"},{"id":"1160028","text":"The clown loach (Chromobotia macracanthus), or tiger botia, is a tropical freshwater fish belonging to the botiid loach family. It is the sole member of the genus Chromobotia. It originates in inland waters in Indonesia on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. It is a popular fish in the freshwater aquarium trade and is sold worldwide. Taxonomy and naming The fish was first described as Cobitis macracanthus by Pieter Bleeker in 1852. In 1989, its scientific name was changed to Botia macracanthus. In 2004, Dr. Maurice Kottelat divided the genus Botia, containing 47 different species, into seven separate genera, resulting in the clown loach being placed in a genus of its own, Chromobotia. The common name, \\"clown loach\\" comes from the fish's bright colours and stripes (much tropical fish with stripes that stand out are commonly called \\"clown\\") as well as from its habit of 'entertaining' aquarium owners with strange habits, such as swimming upside down, or 'playing dead.' clown loaches are an entertaining fish and perfect if you have snails in your tank you want gone. Description and behavior Clown loach in an aquarium Information about the maximum size of the clown loach varies, with some estimates ranging up to , and with typical adult sizes ranging from . The fish's body is long and laterally compressed, with an arched dorsal surface and a flat ventral surface. Its head is relatively large and its mouth faces downward with thick, fleshy lips, and four pairs of barbels. The barbels on the lower jaw are small and difficult to see. Clown loaches can make clicking sounds when they are happy, being territorial (used as a type of weapon/warning) or mating. This sound is produced by the grinding of their pharyngeal teeth. The body is whitish-orange to reddish-orange, with three thick, black, triangular, vertical bands. The anterior band runs from the top of the head and through the eye, the medial band lies between the head and the dorsal fin, and wraps around to the ventral surface, and the posterior band covers almost all of the caudal peduncle and extends to the anal fin. There is some regional colour variation within the species; the pelvic fins on fish from Borneo are reddish-orange and black, while the pelvic fins on fish from Sumatra are entirely reddish-orange. The fish is sexually dimorphic, with females being slightly plumper than males. In addition, the tips of the tail on the male curve inwards slightly, whereas the females have straight tips. The fish has a movable spine that lies in a groove below the eye, which may be extended as a defence mechanism. The spine may cause a painful wound, but is not venomous. It also may be used as a predation tool as it is set close to the mouth. Distribution and habitat Clown loaches are native to the islands of Sumatra and Borneo in Indonesia. Clear stream environments provide the optimal habitat for clown loaches, but biannual monsoon flooding forces the fish to move into flooded flood plains, or murky or blackwater rivers or lakes, for 7‚Äì8 months of the year, and clown loaches are commonly found in the flood plains of hilly areas. Breeding adults migrate to smaller waterways to spawn annually. In its native habitat, the fish is found in water with a temperature range of , a pH between 5.0 and 8.0, and water hardness between 5 and 12 dH. In the aquarium A clown loach in a planted tropical freshwater aquarium. A common and popular fish for tropical freshwater aquaria, C. macracanthus is a visually pleasing species. Although specimens in the wild will reach 40 to 50 cm, in the aquaria it is uncommon for C. macracanthus to attain more than 15 to 20 cm fork length. These fish have bifurcated spines under the eyes. They are thought to be used as a defence mechanism and possibly, for obtaining prey. C. macracanthus will associate with other benthic species in the aquaria if kept singly or with few other specimens. They make suitable tank-mates for any non-aggressive community fishes, but do not thrive when kept with larger, more dominant species. Occasionally C. macracanthus will exhibit erratic swimming patterns, such as swimming on their sides or upside down. This is not usually a cause for concern, however, and the fish will normally return to normal behaviour almost instantly. As C. macracanthus is found in riverine environments it is able to cope with good flow rates of water in the aquaria. Aquascapes should replicate this environment to suit the requirements of the species with areas of high flow, but also areas of low flow to allow the fish to rest. C. macracanthus is also fond of cover and is not overly accustomed to bright lighting. The fish will often seek areas of shade or cover in which to rest during the day and become more active when light levels are more subdued. The barbels of clown loaches are known to be easily damaged by rough substrates, such as gravel, in aquaria. ich. Characteristically, for this stage of infestation, both are hiding in an ornament. Clown loaches are particularly susceptible to Ichthyophthirius (ich), or white spot disease. Due to the fact that clown loaches have small or no scales, they are often not treated with full doses of medications. Over-exploitation of C. macracanthus has motivated the development of conservation efforts, mostly new artificial propagation techniques. C. macracanthus is easier to breed when individuals are between two and four centimeters in size. Most clown loaches accept commercial flake food and sinking pellets as their dietary staple, but thrive with a variety of food: live (worms, brine shrimp, small snails), banana, other plant matter, freeze-dried (tubifex worms, especially if it is fortified) and frozen brine shrimp (always thaw frozen food to aquarium temperature). Clown loaches (and their cousins) are also one of the few fishes that will eat bladder snails (Physella acuta), and are very useful for controlling this pest in planted aquaria.

Rathbun was from Rhode Island with family in Boston. Rathbun served in the Continental Navy from its late 1775 beginning as John Paul Jones First Lieutenant. Capture of Nassau Rathbun was promoted to Captain in April 1777 and given command of the sloop-of-war Providence upon which he had participated in an American attack on New Providence in 1776. Rathbun took Providence back to the Bahamas on the night of 27 January 1778. Rathbun approached Nassau disguised as a trading sloop and anchored offshore in darkness. Twenty-six marines under command of Captain John Trevett went ashore by boat with a scaling ladder. They climbed Fort Nassau's 22-foot walls with the ladder and overpowered the two guards before daybreak. The Marines then continued sending the guards' periodic \\"All is well\\" call to guards outside of the fort while repositioned the fort's 18-pound cannon to cover parts of the city and harbor from which reinforcements might arrive. Dawn found the American stars and stripes flying over conquered enemy territory for the first time since the Continental Congress approved the flag. While his remaining marines patrolled the wall in full view of the city, Trevett sent three Marines to Fort Montague with a claim that a force of 230 Marines held Fort Nassau. Fort Montague surrendered, and Marines spiked the cannon and poured the gunpowder into the sea. Twenty-four American merchant seamen came forward to assist. The Americans had been stranded in Nassau when their ships had been captured by privateers. The American merchant seamen were sent into the harbor to demand surrender of five ships lying under the guns of Fort Nassau. Rathbun brought Providence into harbor in the early afternoon, and loaded all Fort Nassau's gunpowder and 300 small arms. Rathbun departed on the morning of 30th, with three captured ships manned by the American merchant seamen, after spiking the guns of Fort Nassau and burning the two ships he could not man. No blood had been shed.Rathbun, Frank H. \\"Rathbun's Raid on Nassau\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings November 1970 pp.40-47 Action At Sea In 1779, he assumed command of the frigate Queen of France and in July cruised off Newfoundland with Providence and Ranger. On the 16th, the ships sighted a convoy bound for Britain. Fog closed in, but when it lifted, Queen of France was next to a merchantman whose crew mistook the American for a British escort vessel. Rathbun took advantage of the situation, exploited the mistake in identity, and captured the ship. Ranger and Providence followed suit. Ten more ships were cut out of the convoy, their total value approaching $1 million. Defense of Charleston In 1780, Rathbun took Queen of France south in Commodore Abraham Whipple's force to bolster the defenses of Charleston, South Carolina. There, with smaller ships, she was stationed in the Ashley River to prevent British forces under Cornwallis from crossing and attacking the city. As the American position weakened, Queen of France's guns were removed and she was sunk as a block ship. Her crew then went ashore and Rathbun served as an artilleryman until the city fell in May 1781. Privateer Taken prisoner at the fall of Charleston, Rathbun and the other American captains were paroled and allowed to return to New England. There, he found that the Continental Navy had dwindled and no commands were available. Thereupon, Rathbun, a true patriot, secured a commission from Congress on 4 August to command the Massachusetts privateer brig Wexford. About two weeks later, he set sail from Boston bound for St. George's Channel near Britain and, within another six weeks reached the coast of Ireland. There, less than 100 miles from Cape Clear, he ran afoul of the 32-gun frigate HMS Recovery. Following a 24-hour chase during which HMS Recovery fired at least one broadside, Rathbun and his ship were captured by the British warship. Incarcerated first at Kinsale Prison near Cork, Ireland, Rathbun was later transferred to Mill Prison or Old Mill Prison in Plymouth, England, where he died on 20 June 1782. Namesakes Two ships, USS Rathburne, were named for him. Although his name was spelled Rathburne or Rathbourne in official records, including the two warships named after him, this was an error. His name was Rathbun.

It is named after the town and county of the same name (Huntingdon, Huntingdonshire) in east central England. It is situated in the Montreal South Shore region of Mont√©r√©gie, one of the roughly 12 regions of Quebec. The county was bounded entirely on its south by the Canada‚ÄìUS border (45¬∞ N for 88.75 km from 73¬∞32‚Ä≤ W to 74¬∞40‚Ä≤ W), along its northwestern flank by Lake St- Francis (Lac St-Fran√ßois) of the Saint Lawrence River to its most northern point on the river at 45¬∞13‚Ä≤ N and 74¬∞13‚Ä≤ W, to the east by Saint-Jean County, with its easternmost point at 45¬∞5.5' N and 73¬∞31‚Ä≤ W (this point forms the junction of the borders of Ch√¢teauguay County, Napierville County and Saint- Jean County) and to the north from east to west by Napierville County, Ch√¢teauguay County, and Beauharnois County. On the other side of the Saint Lawrence River is Soulanges County, Quebec, the Township of Lancaster and the Township of Charlottenburgh in Glengarry County, Ontario, and the Township of Cornwall in Stormont County, Ontario. Huntingdon County is the only county in the St Lawrence Valley to be entirely and totally divided into townships, of which there are 7. All these townships run in a straight line and have the Canada‚ÄìUS border as a common southern border. From east to west they are the Township of Hemmingford, the Township of Havelock, the Franklin Township, the Township of Hinchinbrooke, the Township of Elgin, the Township of Godmanchester, and the Township of Dundee. The county seat, Huntingdon, located at 45¬∞5‚Ä≤ N and 74¬∞10‚Ä≤ W, straddles the border between Hinchinbrooke and Godmanchester. Except for Godmanchester, all the other townships have a community that takes the name of the township in which it is situated (Hemmingford, Havelock, Franklin, Hinchinbrooke, Elgin, Dundee). A notable feature of Huntingdon County is the presence of the Saint Regis Akwesasne Mohawk Reserve at the westernmost point of the county in the Township of Dundee. That area of the Saint Lawrence, like many along its length, contains many small islands. The Reserve straddles the meeting point of the Quebec- Ontario-New York State borders at that point. The American side of the Reserve is Franklin County, New York. On 1 January 1982, the County was officially dissolved. Most of the County became part of the MRC de Le Haut-Saint-Laurent except for a small section in the far east (The Township of Hemmingford and the Village of Hemmingford) which became part of MRC de Les Jardins-de- Napierville.

Most chorale cantatas were written between approximately 1650 and 1750. By far the most famous are by Johann Sebastian Bach, especially the cantatas composed in his second annual cycle of cantatas, started in Leipzig in 1724. Description The chorale cantata developed out of the chorale concerto, an earlier form much used by Samuel Scheidt in the early 17th century, which incorporated elements of the Venetian School, such as the concertato style, into the liturgical music of the Protestant Reformation. Later the chorale cantata developed into three general forms: * a form in which each verse (strophe) of the chorale was developed as an independent movement; * a form in which the chorale appeared in some of the movements, perhaps only two, while the other parts of the cantata used other texts; and * the version pioneered by J. S. Bach, in which the first and last movements use the first and last strophes of the chorale, but the inner movements--perhaps aria and recitative--use paraphrases of the chorale text. Typically the beginning and ending movements use all the instrumental and vocal forces, while the interior movements are for smaller groups. Most compositions in this genre were never published. It was common at the time for composers to write for local performances; often the composer and the music director at a church were the same person, and the music was written, copied and performed in short order, remaining in manuscript. Some 95% of all compositions of this type have been lost. Composers Composers of chorale cantatas include: =Baroque= *Samuel Scheidt *Johann Andreas Herbst *Johann Erasmus Kindermann *Franz Tunder *Nicolaus Bruhns *Dieterich Buxtehude *Johann Krieger *Sebastian Kn√ºpfer *Johann Schelle *Johann Pachelbel, e.g. his sacred concerto Christ lag in Todesbanden, P 60, with one movement for each of the \\"Christ lag in Todesbanden\\" hymn's seven stanzas. *Johann Rosenm√ºller *Johannes Cr√ºger *Joachim Gerstenb√ºttel *Georg Bronner *Christoph Graupner *Johann Kuhnau *Georg Philipp Telemann *Johann Sebastian Bach =Post-Baroque= *Felix Mendelssohn (Verleih uns Frieden) *Arnold Mendelssohn References * Articles \\"Chorale cantata\\", \\"Chorale settings\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

Biography He was born on June 20, 1731, in Charlestown, Massachusetts, and was one of the \\"minutemen\\" who engaged the British at the onset of the American Revolutionary War. Later placed in charge of a small gunboat during the siege of British troops in Boston, Waters was appointed by General George Washington to command the schooner Lee on January 20, 1776. He was soon actively engaged in the ensuing assault upon British communications, capturing one enemy vessel in February and another in May. Aided by Warren, Lee seized an armed troopship with 94 Scottish Highlander troops on board in early June. Later in the month, Waters and Lee shared with other vessels the capture of transports Howe and Annabella. Again at the recommendation of Washington, Waters was appointed a captain in the Continental Navy on March 15, 1777, and given command of the frigate Fox. Shortly thereafter, Waters and Fox, along with Hancock, were forced to surrender to superior British forces off Halifax, Nova Scotia. Following an exchange in 1778, Waters made a cruise to the West Indies in the spring of 1779 in the Continental sloop General Gates. He then commanded the Massachusetts ship General Putnam in an ill-fated expedition against Castine, Maine, in which the American ships were destroyed in the mouth of the Penobscot River to prevent their capture . Waters' most famous exploit occurred on Christmas Day, 1779, when he led the Boston privateer Thorn in a successful, two-hour action against two enemy privateers of about equal armament, but more heavily manned. In the fierce fight, during which Governor William Tryon and Sir William Erskine were captured, Waters was wounded. John Adams was to write of this engagement: \\"There has not been a more memorable action this war.\\" Waters' last cruise was in the Massachusetts privateer Friendship, to which he was appointed in January 1781. Following the war, Waters retired to his farm in Malden, Massachusetts, where he died on March 26, 1816. Namesake USS Waters (DD-115) was named for him.

The Tamworth Country Music Festival is an annual Australian music festival held for 10 days from Friday to Sunday in mid to late January each year, sometimes including Australia Day, in Tamworth, New South Wales. The festival is a celebration of country music culture and heritage, in particular the national Australian country music scene, with numerous concerts and live performances at various venues. During the festival the city of Tamworth comes alive with visitors from all across the country and worldwide. The festival has many times been counted among the world's top ten music festivals. In 2007, Forbes rated it as number 8 of the \\"World's Coolest Music Festivals\\". The enormous number of visitors during the bash doubles the city's population and brings significant tourism and economic benefits to the region. Visitor numbers for the 2012 festival were estimated at 50,000. The mass number of visitors means that accommodation throughout the area is consistently booked out for this period up to 12 months in advance, with many visitors camping in caravans, camper vans and tents by the city's riverside and numerous other temporary camping sites throughout the region. The festival is the second biggest country music festival in the world, after Nashville. Media coverage A significant amount of media coverage is given locally and national, in the printed media and also with the three big commercial networks the Nine Network, Channel 7 and Ten Network having broadcast news and segments from the festival. There is also national radio coverage from stations including ABC Country, ABC Radio Australia and KIX Country. History When the Tamworth Country Music Festival commenced is often debated. In 1968 the then Tamworth branch of the Modern Country Music Association, now the Capital Country Music Association (CCMA), began a talent quest on the Australia Day long weekend in January. The talent quest, now known as the CCMA National Talent Quest, is considered a major influence in what was to become the festival in January 1973 with the first staging, by local radio station 2TM, of the Australasian Country Music Awards (aka the Golden Guitar Awards for its distinctive \\"golden guitar\\" trophy) as part of its Country Music Capital promotion which had commenced in 1969. The festival expanded to many other activities, with events running back throughout the week before the Awards and National Talent Quest staged on what was then the Australia Day long weekend. These events included Bluegrass Championships, Hands of Fame inductions, the Roll of Renown, rodeo events, Coca-Cola Concerts, Toyota Star Maker Quest, Tamworth Songwriters' Association Awards, busking in Peel Street, the Cavalcade and industry seminars among other events. These events were promoted to highlight Australian Country Music and to draw attention to the climax of the 10 days, the Golden Guitar Awards. Radio 2TM ran the awards until 1993 when they were passed on to the newly formed national industry organisation, the Country Music Association of Australia. The staging of the Golden Guitar Awards moved from Sunday to the Saturday night in the last weekend of the festival in late January as the Australia Day public holiday was moved to float with the 26 January date. Music =Styles= Since the festival's original commencement the following music genres have been performed: classic country, bluegrass, country rock, folk, urban country, alternative country, rockabilly, Western swing, country rock'n'roll, yodelling, rock, blues and World music. The festival has diversified in styles of country as the genre country music itself has broadened, additionally other styles of music are played at the festival. =Festival awards= Golden Guitar Awards The CMAA's awards night ceremony is called the Country Music Awards of Australia in which winning artists are presented with Golden Guitar Award trophies that are miniature replicas of the Golden Guitar statue. These awards are highly coveted in the Australian country music industry. The presentation of awards is regarded as the pinnacle event of the Tamworth Country Music Festival Other awards and talent quests * Toyota Star Maker QuestToyota Star Maker * Telstra Road to Discovery * No Holds Barred Fiddle Contest * Telstra Queen of Country Music Quest * Aristocrat Junior and Senior Entertainer of The Year * Kids Talent Quest * Country Entertainer of the Year =Main and Peel streets= During the music festival the main shopping street (Peel Street) is restricted to pedestrians only. In this area, buskers are required to register with the local council. There is also a competition between these registered buskers to find the festival's best busker. There has been complaint and controversy about the use of very loud PA systems against acoustic performances. Council officers are known to walk the street with decibel meters during performances. Since January is a summer month with daytime temperatures regularly hovering around 38 ¬∞C, it is during the nighttime that the city really comes to life, with people heading down town to drink, dance and generally party while numerous bands play up and down the main street. Venues During the festival over 2500 acts use up to 120 venues. The largest venue used is the Tamworth Regional Entertainment Centre which has a capacity of 5100 people. Festival Countdown The Festival Countdown is the \\"pre-festival\\" festival. During this week before the festival many country music fans come to Tamworth to set up camp and enjoy the city, while there are also dozens of concerts scheduled during this week. Attractions Besides the music the festival has many other country music attractions for visitors. These include the Big Golden Guitar, Country Music Wax Museum, Hands of Fame Park and the National Guitar Museum of successful country music artists. Additionally fine arts, crafts, street performers and markets attract large crowds in Peel St. The Country Music Cavalcade on the last Saturday of the festival attracts large crowds to Peel Street, with many businesses and musicians participating with floats in the parade. Preparation During the buildup prior to the commencement of celebrations, the Tamworth Regional Council takes steps to beautify and secure the city, performing such works as: * Erecting signs to direct traffic away from hot spots, and reduce congestion. * Pre-Festival advertising and promotional campaigns. * Extensive road maintenance. * Blocking traffic from four blocks of Peel Street, the central shopping district. * Co-ordinating and tidying the expansive camping grounds. * Co-ordinating with the CMAA (Country Music Association of Australia) in connection with events. * Co-ordination with law enforcement and security bodies. Artist lineups Keith Urban The Tamworth Country Music Festival attracts many country music, bluegrass, rock and folk musicians to the city each year. Performers perform at various venues in the city.

Sea Poacher (SS-406) was built by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 20 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. J. H. Spiller, wife of Commander Spiller, hull superintendent at the Navy Yard; and commissioned on 31 July 1944, Commander Francis M. Gambacorta in command.  World War II  Following underway trials, training, and shakedown in the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and New London, Connecticut, areas, Sea Poacher transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 25 October 1944. Although her first two war patrols were unproductive, during the third, conducted in the Kuril Islands area, Sea Poacher torpedoed and sank a Japanese trawler and, four days later, sent two fishing boats to the bottom in a surface attack. During the latter action, three crewmen were injured when the 20 millimeter gun exploded. Due to the seriousness of their injuries, the patrol was terminated ahead of schedule, and the submarine returned to Midway. After conducting her fourth war patrol off the eastern coast of Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç, Sea Poacher was undergoing refitting at Pearl Harbor when the war ended on 15 August 1945.  1946 ‚Äì 1974  From 1946 to 1949, Sea Poacher was based at Balboa, Canal Zone, as a unit of Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6) engaging in fleet exercises and antisubmarine training, and, on 1 June 1949, was transferred to Key West, Florida, as a unit of SubRon 4. In 1951, the submarine became the first GUPPY IA conversion performed at the Charleston Naval Shipyard. For the remainder of her 25-year career, Sea Poacher operated for the most part in the Key West and Caribbean areas, providing services to various units of the Atlantic Fleet with time out for tours of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean and various exercises with NATO forces. On 10 July 1952, while operating in the Key West area, the submarine had the unique experience of rescuing a blimp which had suffered an engine casualty and was floating helplessly in the water. The submarine promptly came to the aid of the stricken airship and proceeded to tow it the back to its base at Naval Air Station, Boca Chica, Florida. In July 1959, Sea Poacher was transferred to SubRon 12, also based at Key West, and continued to serve as a unit of this squadron for the remainder of her active service. In the fall of 1962, Sea Poacher was deployed with other Atlantic Fleet units maintaining the quarantine imposed on Cuba during the missile crisis. In 1969, Sea Poacher concluded her service with a -month deployment to the eastern and northern Atlantic areas to participate in antisubmarine training exercises with units of the Spanish and Portuguese navies. Upon returning to Key West, the submarine operated locally and in the Caribbean until 20 October when she set sail for Philadelphia and in- activation. Sea Poacher was reclassified an Auxiliary Submarine AGSS-306 on 1 November, decommissioned on 15 November 1969, and was assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia. On 30 June 1971, she reassumed the designation of a fleet submarine (SS). On 15 August 1973, her name was struck from the Navy List, and the submarine was sold to Peru in July 1974.  BAP La Pedrera (S-49)  Sea Poacher was transferred (sold) under terms of the Security Assistance Program, to Peru, 1 July 1974. She was commissioned into the Peruvian Navy, initially as BAP Pabell√≥n de Pica (S-49), but her name was changed a few weeks later to La Pedrera. She was taken out of service in 1995, and relegated to pierside training. Honors and awards As Sea Poacher, she received four battle stars for World War II service.

In 2015, The Economist Magazine's \\"List of America's Best Colleges\\" ranked TAMIU ninth in the nation, ahead of all other schools in Texas. In 2013, the National Council on Teacher Quality, based in Washington, D.C., ranked TAMIU subpar in the matriculation of its education majors, of which there were some seven hundred graduates between 2009 and 2012. The institution received 2.5 on an 8.0 ranking system, or 1.5 for its elementary program and 1.0 for the secondary studies. TAMIU provides the majority of public school teachers to the two systems in Webb County.

TAMIU suggested that the NCTQ favors the dismantling of university teacher education programs with \\"bargain-basement on-line programs, some of which are directed by NCTQ surrogates.\\" TAMIU questioned why no NCTQ researcher visited the campus but instead based its evaluation on information sent primarily to the Washington office via emails. The TAMIU program was placed on probation in February 2013 by the Texas Board of Educator Certification. Though 70 percent of the TAMIU education graduates passed the certification examination, state accountability standards require an 80 percent completion rate to avoid the probationary status. TAMIU President Ray Keck noted that Texas Tech, Rutgers, Syracuse, and Stanford universities all fared poorly in the NCTQ study as well and asked, \\"Do you honestly believe those universities run slipshod programs in education?\\" In July 2014, the University was notified by the State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC) that its full accreditation status had been restored.https://www.tamiu.edu/newsinfo/newsarticles/2014-COEDAccreditation061914.shtml In 2014, the College Affordability and Transparency Center, a project of the U.S. Department of Education, ranked the university sixth in the nation for lowest net price among public four-year universities.http://collegecost.ed.gov/catc/ =Research= TAMIU is home to various research centers, including the Binational Center, Center for the Study of Western Hemispheric Trade, The Western Hemispheric Trade Information Center, the Texas Center for Border Economics and Enterprise Development, the Small Business Development Center and the Center for Earth and Environmental Studies. =Benefactors= One of the institution's largest private benefactors was Radcliffe Killam (1910-2007), a Laredo oilman who donated $2 million to establish The Center for Western Hemispheric Trade, in addition to the University's campus land.

The fibula bears an inscription in Old Latin. At the time of its discovery in the late nineteenth century, it was accepted as the earliest known specimen of the Latin language. The authenticity of the inscription has since been disputed. However a new analysis performed in 2011 declared it to be genuine \\"beyond any reasonable doubt\\" and to date from the Orientalizing period, in the first half of the seventh century BC. Discovery The fibula was presented to the public in 1887 by Wolfgang Helbig, an archaeologist. According to some sources, Helbig did not explain how he had come to acquire the artifact at the time, although others state that the fibula \\"was first made known to the public in three short articles in the for 1887 where it is said to have been purchased in Palestrina by a friend of Helbig in the year 1871, or five years before the discovery of the tomb\\" ‚Äì the tomb in question being the Bernardini Tomb whose treasure the fibula was later claimed to be a part of. Date and inscription The inscription on the Praeneste Fibula. The writing runs from right to left. The fibula was thought to originate from the 7th century BC. It is inscribed with a text that appears to be written in Old Latin or Proto-Latino-Faliscan (shown by MED /med/ as an accusative instead of ablative), here transcribed to Roman letters: :MANIOS MED FHEFHAKED NVMASIOI The reconstructed Proto-Italic ancestor would have been: :*MƒÅnjos mƒì fefaked Numazj≈çi The equivalent Classical Latin sentence obtained by applying the appropriate differences between Old Latin and Classical Latin would probably have been: :*MANIVS ME FECIT NVMERIO translated as: :Manius made me for Numerius  Hoax theory In 1980 Margherita Guarducci, a leading epigraphist, published a book claiming that the inscription had been forged by Francesco Martinetti, an art dealer, and Helbig, who were known to have collaborated in shady dealings. Its presentation in 1887, she claimed, was in fact a hoax perpetrated to advance the careers of both men. This was the most formal but not the first accusation of its kind: Georg Karo had said that Helbig told him that the fibula had been stolen from Palestrina's Tomba Bernardini. Claimed authenticity  Evidence in favor of the genuineness of the text came from a new Etruscan inscription of the Orientalizing period published by Massimo Poetto and Giulio Facchetti in 1999. The inscription scratched on the body of an Etrusco-Corinthian aryballos shows a gentilicium, Numasiana, which provides confirmation of the genuineness of the name Numasioi on the Fibula Prenestina, often regarded as suspicious by the supporters of the theory that it was a forgery. In 2011, new scientific evidence was presented by the research team of Edilberto Formigli and Daniela Ferro, whose optical, physical and chemical analyses allowed them to take into consideration smaller scrapes on the surface of the object than was possible in the 1980s. Observation by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and detailed physical and chemical analyses on the surface of small areas within the track of the incision showed the existence of micro-crystallization of the gold surface: a natural phenomenon that could have taken place only in the course of centuries after the fusion. The study reported that a 19th-century forger could not have realized such a forgery. However, the micro-crystallization discovery alone seems to still leave open the possibility that C. Densmore Curtis' impression, expressed in 1919, that \\"based on its stiff lines and awkward transitions, ... it did not come from the Bernardini Tomb, but is of a somewhat later date\\", could be correct. Already in 2005, based on epigraphic and other arguments, linguist Markus Hartmann concluded that it is justified to assume the authenticity of the inscription as long as there is no compelling evidence for a forgery, and dated it with confidence to the seventh century BC. Replicas Replicas of the fibula are held by the National Roman Museum's Museum of Epigraphy at the Baths of Diocletian in Rome, and also by the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard in Cambridge, Massachussetts.

During World War II he served as a gunnery officer providing security aboard merchant vessels throughout the Pacific Ocean and Persian Gulf; in fall 1945 Noel discharged from the navy at the rank of lieutenant commander. =U.S. Foreign Service career= After the war, while studying for his PhD at Harvard, Noel passed the United States Foreign Service exam and was hired by the Department of State. In 1951 he married fellow Foreign Service worker Lucille McHenry. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Noel served with U.S. consulates in Italy, Saudi Arabia, France, Lebanon and Sudan. Noel was particularly fascinated with the Middle East and regularly toured the region, learning the Arabic language. =Ambassadorship to Sudan and death= On December 23, 1972, Noel was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Sudan when Sudan and the U.S. reestablished diplomatic relations severed as the result of the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. The outgoing Charge d'Affairs, George Curtis Moore, was asked to stay on as Deputy Chief of Mission until the new Deputy arrived in March. On the evening of March 1, 1973, militants from the Black September faction of PLO stormed the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum, where a farewell ceremony for Moore had just concluded. Noel was wounded during the taking, he and Moore were among the ten diplomats taken hostage by the militants. The next day, March 2, the hostage takers shot Noel to death. Also murdered were his deputy, Moore; and Belgian diplomat Guy Eid. After a joint funeral on March 7 at the National Presbyterian Church in Washington D.C., Cleo Noel Jr. and Curtis Moore were buried with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

He was born in the Avanti region, roughly corresponding to modern-day Malwa (part of Madhya Pradesh, India), to Adityadasa. According to one of his own works, he was educated at Kapitthaka. The Indian tradition believes him to be one of the \\"Nine Jewels\\" (Navaratnas) of the court of ruler Yashodharman Vikramaditya of Malwa. However, this claim appears for the first time in a much later text and scholars consider this claim to be doubtful because neither Varahamihira and Vikramaditya lived in the same century nor did Varahamihira live in the same century as some of the other names in the \\"nine jewels\\" list such as the much older Kalidasa. VarƒÅhamihira's most notable work was Brihat Samhita, an encyclopedic, Quote: \\"[...] the new temples and inconography, the science of architecture, the enormous encyclopedia the Brihat Samhita of Varahamihira [...]\\" work on architecture, temples, planetary motions, eclipses, timekeeping, astrology, seasons, cloud formation, rainfall, agriculture, mathematics, gemology, perfumes and many other topics. According to Varahamihira, in some verses he was merely summarizing earlier existing literature on astronomy, Shilpa Sastra and temple architecture, yet his presentation of different theories and models of design are among the earliest texts that have survived. The chapters of the Brihat Samhita and verses of Varahamihira were quoted by the Persian traveler and scholar Al Biruni. VarƒÅhamihira is also credited with writing several authoritative texts on astronomy and astrology. He learned the Greek language, and praised the Greeks (Yavanas) in his text for being \\"well trained in the sciences\\". Some scholars consider him to be the strong candidate as the one who understood and introduced the zodiac signs, predictive calculations for auspicious ceremonies and astrological computations to the Indian subcontinent from the Greek literature.David Pingree (1963), Astronomy and Astrology in India and Iran, Isis, Vol. 54, No. 2, University of Chicago Press, pp. 229-246 Works =Pancha-Siddhantika= Varahamihira's main work is the book ' (\\"[Treatise] on the Five [Astronomical] Canons\\") dated ca. 575 CE, which gives us information about older Indian texts which are now lost. The work is a treatise on mathematical astronomy and it summarises five earlier astronomical treatises by five authors, namely the Surya Siddhanta, Romaka Siddhanta, Paulisa Siddhanta, Vasishtha Siddhanta and Paitamaha Siddhanta. It is a compendium of Vedanga Jyotisha as well as Hellenistic astronomy (including Greek, Egyptian and Roman elements). Varahamihira was the first one to mention that the ayanamsa, or the shifting of the equinox is 50.32 seconds. :They [the Indians] have 5 SiddhƒÅntas: :*S≈´rya-SiddhƒÅnta, the siddhƒÅnta of the Sun, thought to be composed by deva, but actually composed by Mayasura also known as Mamuni Mayan as stated in the text itself. :*Vasishtha-siddhƒÅnta, so called from one of the stars of the Great Bear, composed by Vishnucandra, :*Paulisa- siddhƒÅnta, so called from Paulisa, the Greek, from the city of Saintra, which is supposed to be Alexandria, composed by Paulisa. :*Romaka-siddhƒÅnta, so called from the R≈´m, ie. the subjects of the Roman Empire, composed by ≈örƒ´she·πáa. :*Paitahama-siddhƒÅnta. =Brihat-Samhita= Another important contribution of Varahamihira is the encyclopedic Brihat-Samhita. Although the book is mostly about divination, it also includes a wide range of subjects other than divination. It covers wide-ranging subjects of human interest, including astronomy, planetary movements, eclipses, rainfall, clouds, architecture, growth of crops, manufacture of perfume, matrimony, domestic relations, gems, pearls, and rituals. The volume expounds on gemstone evaluation criterion found in the Garuda Purana, and elaborates on the sacred Nine Pearls from the same text. It contains 106 chapters and is known as the \\"great compilation\\". =On Astrology= Varahamihira's Brihajjataka is a Sanskrit text on predictive astrology based on the Vedic Astrology system. The above manuscript was copied in Nepal in 1399 CE in the Nepalaksara script, and is now in the Cambridge University Library. Hora shastra or Brihadjathaka is a most acclaimed astrological work by Mihira. It is mostly in code language. More than a dozen commentaries have been written for this work. The Kerala School of Astrology is mainly based on Brihadjathaka. His son Prithuyasas also contributed to Hindu astrology; his book Hora Sara is a famous book on horoscopy. Khana (also named Lilavati elsewhere), the medieval Bengali poet astrologer, is believed to be the daughter-in-law of Varahamihira. Influences The Romaka Siddhanta (\\"Doctrine of the Romans\\") and the Paulisa Siddhanta were two works of Western origin which influenced Varahamihira's thought. Paulisa Siddhanta is often mistakenly thought to be a single work and attributed to Paul of Alexandria (c. 378 CE). However, this notion has been rejected by other scholars in the field, notably by David Pingree who stated that \\"...the identification of Paulus Alexandrinus with the author of the Pauli≈õa SiddhƒÅnta is totally false\\". Number of his writings share similarities with the earlier texts like Vedanga Jyotisha. A comment in the Brihat-Samhita, quoting Garga, an earlier astronomer, says: \\"The Greeks, though barbaric, must be honored since they have shown tremendous interest in our science.....\\" (\\"mleccha hi yavanah tesu samyak shastram kdamsthitam/ rsivat te 'p i pujyante kim punar daivavid dvijah\\" (Brihat-Samhita 2.15)). Contributions =Trigonometry= Varahamihira improved the accuracy of the sine tables of Aryabhata. =Combinatorics= He was among the first mathematicians to discover a version of what is now known as the Pascal's triangle. He used it to calculate the binomial coefficients. He also records the first known 4√ó4 magic square. =Optics= Among Varahamihira's contribution to physics is his statement that reflection is caused by the back-scattering of particles and refraction (the change of direction of a light ray as it moves from one medium into another) by the ability of the particles to penetrate inner spaces of the material, much like fluids that move through porous objects.

The mine was dug by the Tunnelling Companies of the Royal Engineers under a German field fortification known as (Swabian Height). The British named the mine after Lochnagar Street, the trench from which the gallery was driven. The charge at Lochnagar was one of 19 mines that were dug under the German lines on the British section of the Somme front, to assist the infantry advance at the start of the battle. The mine was sprung at on 1 July 1916 and left a crater deep and wide, which was captured and held by British troops. The attack on either flank was defeated by German small arms and artillery fire, except on the extreme right flank and just south of La Boisselle, north of the Lochnagar Crater. The crater has been preserved as a memorial and a religious service is held each 1 July. Background =1914= French and German military operations began on the Somme in September 1914. A German advance westwards towards Albert was stopped by the French at La Boisselle and attempts to resume offensive warfare in October failed. Both sides reduced their attacks to local operations or raids and began to fortify their remaining positions with underground works. On 18 December, the French captured the La Boisselle village cemetery at the west end of a German salient and established an advanced post only from the German front line. By 24 December, the French had forced the Germans back from the cemetery and the western area of La Boisselle but their advance was stopped a short distance forward at , in front of German trenches protected by barbed wire. Once the location of a farm and a small number of buildings, became known as (German, shell farm) to the Germans and later as the Glory Hole to the British. On Christmas Day 1914, French engineers sank the first mine shaft at La Boisselle. =1915= Fighting continued in no man's land at the west end of La Boisselle, where the opposing lines were apart, even during lulls along the rest of the Somme front. On the night of , a German sapper inadvertently broke into French mine gallery, which he found to have been charged with explosives; a group of volunteers took racking minutes to dismantle the charge and cut the firing cables. The French mine workings were taken over when the British moved into the Somme front. George Fowke moved the 174th and 183rd Tunnelling Companies into the area, but at first the British did not have enough miners to take over the large number of French shafts; the problem was temporarily solved when the French agreed to leave their engineers at work for several weeks. On 24 July, 174th Tunnelling Company established headquarters at Bray, taking over some 66 shafts at Carnoy, Fricourt, Maricourt and La Boisselle. No man's land just south-west of La Boisselle was very narrow, at one point about wide, and had become pockmarked by many chalk craters. To provide the tunnellers needed, the British formed the 178th and 179th Tunnelling Companies in August, followed by the 185th and 252nd Tunnelling Companies in October. The 181st Tunnelling Company was also present on the Somme. Elaborate precautions were taken to preserve secrecy, since no continuous front line trench ran through the area opposite the west end of La Boisselle and the British front line. The site was defended by posts near the mine shafts. The underground war continued with offensive mining to destroy opposing strong points and defensive mining to destroy tunnels, which were long. Around La Boisselle, the Germans dug defensive transverse tunnels about long, parallel to the front line. On 19 November, the 179th Tunnelling Company commander, Captain Henry Hance, estimated that the Germans were away and ordered the mine chamber to be loaded with of explosives, which was completed by midnight on At the Germans blew the charge, filling the remaining British tunnels with carbon monoxide. The right and left tunnels collapsed and it was later found that the German explosion had detonated the British charge. From April 1915 to January 1916, were sprung around , some loaded with of explosives. Prelude =1916= At the start of the Battle of Albert (1‚Äì13 July), the name given by the British to the first two weeks of the Battle of the Somme, La Boisselle stood on the main axis of British attack. Royal Engineer tunnelling companies were to make two contributions to the Allied preparations for the battle, by placing 19 mines of varying sizes beneath the German positions along the front line and by preparing a series of shallow Russian saps from the British front line into no man's land. The saps would be opened at Zero Hour and allow the infantry to attack the German positions from a comparatively short distance. At La Boisselle, four mines were prepared by the Royal Engineers, charges No 2 straight and No 5 right were planted at at the end of galleries dug from Inch Street Trench by the 179th Tunnelling Company, intended to wreck German tunnels and create crater lips to block enfilade fire along no man's land. The Germans in La Boisselle had fortified the cellars of the ruined houses and cratered ground in the vicinity make a direct infantry assault on the village impossible. Y Sap and Lochnagar mines, named after the trenches from which they were dug, were excavated on the north-east and the south-east of La Boisselle, to assist the attack on either side of the German salient in the village (see map). The 185th Tunnelling Company started work on Lochnagar on 11 November 1915. Two officers and sixteen sappers were killed on 4 February, when the Germans detonated a camouflet near the British three-level mine system, starting from Inch Street, La Boisselle, the deepest level being just above the water table at around . The diggings were handed over to 179th Tunnelling Company in March 1916. The Lochnagar mine consisted of two chambers with a shared access tunnel. The shaft was sunk in the communication trench called Lochnagar Street. After the Black Watch had arrived at La Boisselle at the end of July 1915, many fortifications, originally dug by the French, had been given Scottish names. The Lochnagar mine probably had the first deep incline shaft, which sloped from to a depth of about see map. It was begun behind the British front line and away from the German front line. Starting from the inclined shaft, about below ground, a gallery was driven towards the German lines. For silence, the tunnellers used bayonets with spliced handles and worked barefoot on a floor covered with sandbags. Flints were carefully prised out of the chalk and laid on the floor; if the bayonet was manipulated two-handed, an assistant caught the dislodged material. Spoil was placed in sandbags and passed hand-by-hand along a row of miners sitting on the floor and stored along the side of the tunnel, later to be used to tamp the charge. When about from the , the tunnel was branched and the end of each branch was enlarged to form a chamber for the explosives, the chambers being about apart and deep. see map. When finished, the access tunnel for the Lochnagar mine was and had been excavated at a rate of about per day, until about long, with the galleries ending beneath the . The mine was loaded with of ammonal in two charges of and . As the chambers were not big enough to hold all the explosive, the tunnels that branched to form the 'Y' were also filled with ammonal. One branch was long and the other long. The tunnels did not quite reach the German front line but the blast would dislodge enough material to form a high rim and bury nearby trenches. The Lochnagar and the Y Sap mines were \\"overcharged\\" to ensure that large rims were formed from the disturbed ground. Communication tunnels were also dug for use immediately after the first attack, including a tunnel across no man's land to a point close to the Lochnagar mine, ready to extend to the crater after the detonation as a covered route. The mines were laid without interference by German miners but as the explosives were placed, German miners could be heard below Lochnagar and above the Y Sap mine. An officer wrote Battle =1 July= The four mines at La Boisselle were detonated at on 1 July 1916, the first day on the Somme. The explosion of the Lochnagar mine was initiated by Captain James Young of the 179th Tunnelling Company, who pressed the switches and observed that the firing had been successful. The two charges of the Lochnagar mine created a single, vast, smooth sided, flat bottom crater measuring some 220 feet (67 metres) diameter excluding the lip, and 450 feet (137 metres) across the full extent of the lip. It had obliterated between 300 and 400 feet (91 and 122 metres) of the German dug-outs, all said to have been full of German troops. The Lochnagar mine, along with Y Sap mine, were the largest mines ever detonated. The sound of the blast was considered the loudest man-made noise in history up to that point, with reports suggesting it was heard in London. They would be surpassed a year later by the mines in the Battle of Messines. The Lochnagar mine lay on the sector assaulted by the Grimsby Chums, a Pals battalion (10th Battalion, The Lincolnshire Regiment). The infantry of the British 34th Division, which was composed of Pals battalions from the north of England, attacked the positions on either side of La Boisselle, of Reserve Infantry Regiment 110 of the German 28th Reserve Division, mainly recruited from Baden. When the main attack began at the Grimsby Chums occupied the crater and began to fortify the eastern lip, which dominated the vicinity and the advance continued to the (second position), where it was stopped by the 4th Company, which then counter-attacked and forced the British back to the crater. During the day German artillery fired into Sausage Valley and in the afternoon began systematically to shell areas and then fire bursts of machine- gun fire to catch anyone who moved. German artillery also began to bombard the crater, where wounded and lost men sought shelter, particularly those from Sausage Valley to the south of the village. British artillery began to fire on the crater, which led to shell bursts on both slopes, leaving the men inside with nowhere to hide. A British aircraft flew low overhead and a soldier waved a dead man's shirt, at which the aeroplane flew away and the British shelling stopped. Aerial observation The blowing of the Y Sap and Lochnagar mines was witnessed by pilots who were flying over the battlefield to report back on British troop movements. It had been arranged that continuous overlapping patrols would fly throughout the day. 2nd Lieutenant Cecil Lewis' patrol of 3 Squadron was warned against flying too close to La Boisselle, where two mines were due to go up, but would be able to watch from a safe distance. Flying up and down the line in a Morane Parasol, he watched from above Thiepval, almost two miles from La Boisselle, and later described the early morning scene in his book Sagittarius Rising (1936 [1977]): As aircraft from 3 Squadron flew over the III Corps area, observers reported that the 34th Division had reached Peake Wood on the right flank, increasing the size of the salient which had been driven into the German lines north of Fricourt but that the villages of La Boisselle and Ovillers had not fallen. On 3 July, air observers noted flares lit in the village during the evening, which were used to plot the positions reached by British infantry. A communication tunnel was used to contact troops near the new crater and during the afternoon, troops from the 9th Cheshires of the 19th Division began to move forward and a doctor was sent from the Field Ambulance during the night. By on 2 July, most of the 9th Cheshires had reached the crater and the German trenches adjacent, from which they repulsed several German counter-attacks during the night and the morning. On the evening of 2 July, the evacuation of wounded began and on 3 July, troops from the crater and the vicinity pushed forward to the south- east, occupying a small area against slight opposition. Analysis Despite their colossal size, the Lochnagar and Y Sap mines failed sufficiently to neutralise the German defences in La Boisselle. The ruined village was meant to be captured in 20 minutes but by the end of the first day on the Somme, the III Corps divisions had suffered more than for no result. At Mash Valley, the attackers lost 5,100 men before noon and at Sausage Valley near the crater of the Lochnagar mine, there were over 6,000 casualties, the highest concentration on the battlefield. The 34th Division in III Corps had suffered the greatest number of casualties of the British divisions engaged on 1 July. Commemoration William Orpen, an official war artist, saw the mine crater in 1916 while touring the Somme battlefield, collecting subjects for paintings and described a wilderness of chalk dotted with shrapnel. John Masefield also visited the Somme, while preparing The Old Front Line (1917), in which he also described the area around the crater as dazzlingly white and painful to look at. After the war the was built nearby; after the Second World War, many of the smaller craters were filled but the Lochnagar mine crater remained. Attempts to fill it in were resisted and the land was eventually purchased by an Englishman, Richard Dunning to ensure its preservation, after he read The Old Front Line and was inspired to buy a section of the former front line. Dunning made more than about land sales in the 1970s and was sold the crater. The site had been used by cross-country motorbikes and for fly tipping but Dunning erected a memorial cross on the rim of the crater in 1986, using reclaimed timber from a Gateshead church; the cross was struck by lightning shortly after its installation and was repaired with metal banding.Jim Winters - The Somme 1st Volunteer Artillery (Tynemouth) Association The site attracts about a year and there is an annual memorial service on 1 July, to commemorate the detonation of the mine and the British, French and German war dead, when poppy petals are scattered into the crater. Richard Dunning, owner of the crater, was awarded an MBE in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to First World War remembrance.

It was introduced by United States Senator John J. Crittenden (Constitutional Unionist of Kentucky) on December 18, 1860. It aimed to resolve the secession crisis of 1860‚Äì1861 that eventually led to the American Civil War by addressing the fears and grievances of Southern pro-slavery factions, and by quashing anti-slavery activities. Background The compromise proposed six constitutional amendments and four Congressional resolutions. Crittenden introduced the package on December 18.Amendments Proposed in Congress by Senator John J. Crittenden: December 18, 1860 Avalon Project It was tabled on December 31. It guaranteed the permanent existence of slavery in the slave states and addressed Southern demands in regard to fugitive slaves and slavery in the District of Columbia. It proposed re-instating the Missouri Compromise (which had been functionally repealed in 1854 by the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act, and struck down entirely in 1857 by the Dred Scott decision), and extending the compromise line to the west, with slavery prohibited north of the 36¬∞ 30‚Ä≤ parallel and guaranteed south of it. The compromise included a clause that it could not be repealed or amended. The compromise was popular among Southern members of the Senate, but it was generally unacceptable to the Republicans, who opposed the expansion of slavery beyond the states where it already existed into the territories. The opposition of their party's leader, President-elect Abraham Lincoln, was crucial. Republicans said the compromise \\"would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego.\\" The only territories south of the line were parts of New Mexico Territory and Indian Territory. There was considerable agreement on both sides that slavery would never flourish in New Mexico. The South refused the House Republicans' proposal, approved by committee on December 29, to admit New Mexico as a state immediately. However, not all opponents of the Crittenden Compromise also opposed further territorial expansion of the United States. The New York Times referred to \\"the whole future growth of the Republic\\" and \\"all the Territory that can ever belong to the United States‚Äîthe whole of Mexico and Central America.\\" Components =Amendments to the Constitution= Slave and free states & territories in 1858. The 1820 Missouri Compromise line of 36¬∞ 30‚Ä≤ N. separated Missouri from the Arkansas Territory, but barred slavery from any new states and territories north of this line and west of Missouri, as did the Crittenden Compromise proposed forty years later. (However, this part of the Compromise of 1820 had been largely negated by the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act of 1854 and the U.S. Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision in 1857.) # Slavery would be prohibited in any territory of the United States \\"now held, or hereafter acquired,\\" north of latitude 36 degrees, 30 minutes line. In territories south of this line, slavery of the African race was \\"hereby recognized\\" and could not be interfered with by Congress. Furthermore, property in African slaves was to be \\"protected by all the departments of the territorial government during its continuance.\\" States would be admitted to the Union from any territory with or without slavery as their constitutions provided. # Congress was forbidden to abolish slavery in places under its jurisdiction, such as a military post, within a slave state. # Congress could not abolish slavery in the District of Columbia so long as it existed in the adjoining states of Virginia and Maryland and without the consent of the District's inhabitants. Compensation would be given to owners who refused consent to abolition. # Congress could not prohibit or interfere with the interstate slave trade. # Congress would provide full compensation to owners of rescued fugitive slaves. Congress was empowered to sue the county in which obstruction to the fugitive slave laws took place to recover payment; the county, in turn, could sue \\"the wrong doers or rescuers\\" who prevented the return of the fugitive. # No future amendment of the Constitution could change these amendments or authorize or empower Congress to interfere with slavery within any slave state. =Congressional resolutions= # That fugitive slave laws were constitutional and should be faithfully observed and executed. # That all state laws which impeded the operation of fugitive slave laws, the so-called \\"Personal liberty laws,\\" were unconstitutional and should be repealed. # That the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 should be amended (and rendered less objectionable to the North) by equalizing the fee schedule for returning or releasing alleged fugitives and limiting the powers of marshals to summon citizens to aid in their capture. # That laws for the suppression of the African slave trade should be effectively and thoroughly executed. Results Matthew Brady's 1855 portrait of Sen. Crittenden President-elect Abraham Lincoln vehemently opposed the Crittenden compromise on grounds that he opposed any policy permitting the continued expansion of slavery.https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-sanjac- ushistory1/chapter/the-origins-and-outbreak-of-the-civil-war/ Both the House of Representatives and the Senate rejected Crittenden's proposal. It was part of a series of last-ditch efforts to provide the Southern states with sufficient reassurances to forestall their secession during the final session of Congress prior to the Lincoln administration taking office. The Crittenden proposals were also discussed at the Peace Conference of 1861, a meeting of more than 100 of the nation's leading politicians, held February 8‚Äì27, 1861, in Washington, D.C. The conference, led by former President John Tyler, was the final formal effort of the states to avert the start of war. There too, the Compromise proposals failed, as the provision guaranteeing slave ownership throughout all Western territories and future acquisitions again proved unpalatable. A February 1861 editorial in the Charleston Courier (Charleston, Missouri) summed up the mood prevalent in Southern-leaning border counties as the Crittenden proposals went down in defeat: \\"Men at Washington think there is no chance for peace, and indeed we can see but little, everything looks gloomy. The Crittenden resolutions have been voted down again and again. Is there any other proposition which will win, that the South can accept? If not‚Äîthere comes war‚Äîand woe to the wives and daughters of our land; beauty will be but an incentive to crime, and plunder but pay for John Brown raids. Let our citizens be prepared for the worst, it may come.\\" This statement by editor George Whitcomb came in response to a fiery \\"letter to the editor\\" excoriating \\"disunion\\", from US Representative John William Noell, whose district included Charleston. In popular culture The novel Underground Airlines (2016) by Ben Winters is set in an alternate history where the Crittenden Compromise was accepted.

His father was Nrsimha who was born in 1586. Two of Kamalakara's three brothers were also astronomer and mathematicians: Divakara, who was the eldest of the brothers born in 1606, and Ranganatha who was youngest. KamalƒÅkara learnt astronomy from his elder brother DivƒÅkara, who compiled five works on astronomy. His family later moved to VƒÅrƒÅ·πáasƒ´. Major works KamalƒÅkara's major work, \\"SiddhƒÅntatattvaviveka\\", was compiled in Varanasi at about 1658 and has been published by Sudhakar Dwivedi in the VƒÅrƒÅ·πáasƒ´ series. This work consists of 13 chapters in 3,024 verses. It deals with the topics of: units of time measurement; mean motions of the planets; true longitudes of the planets; the three problems of diurnal rotation; diameters and distances of the planets; the earth's shadow; the moon's crescent; risings and settings; syzygies; lunar eclipses, solar eclipses; planetary transits across the sun's disk; the patas of the moon and sun; the \\"great problems\\"; along a conclusion. His other works include ≈öe·π£avƒÅsanƒÅ and SauravƒÅsanƒÅ. KamalƒÅkara was bitterly opposed to Munishvara, the author of SiddhƒÅntasƒÅrvabhauma. It is wrongly believed by some moderners that KamalƒÅkara discovered the idea that the pole star we see at present is not exactly at the pole. But this ideas was first expressed in Brahmananda Purana and Matsya Purana by sage Veda Vyaasa: \\"uttAnapAda-putro-asau meDhibhooto dhruvo divi  sa hi bhraman bhtaamayate nityam chandraadityau grahaiH saha \\". The meaning of this expression is \\"Uttanapada's son Dhruva is fixed like a pole in the Heaven, but it is moving itself and is making all the planets together with Sun and Moon move\\". KamalƒÅkara's contribution was to rejuvenate this forgotten idea. Contributions * He combined traditional Indian astronomy with Aristotelian physics and Ptolemaic astronomy as presented by Islamic scientists. * In the third chapter of the Siddhanta-tattva-viveka Kamalakara used the addition and subtraction theorems for the sine and the cosine to give trigonometric formulae for the sines and cosines of double, triple, quadruple and quintuple angles. In particular he gives formulae for sin(A/2) and sin(A/4) in terms of sin(A) and iterative formulae for sin(A/3) and sin(A/5). * According to David Pingree, he presents the only Sanskrit treatise on geometrical optics.D Pingree, Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography (New York 1970‚Äì1990) * He has assumed a value of 60 units for the radius of the Earth and gives values for sines at 1¬∞ intervals. * KamalƒÅkara also gives a table for finding the right ascension of a planet from its longitude Articles * A K Bag, \\"Indian literature on mathematics during 1400‚Äì1800 A.D.\\", Indian J.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 to 1990, and a cabinet minister in the government of Howard Pawley from 1981 to 1988. Cowan left the United States of America during the Vietnam War to avoid that nation's military draft. In Canada, he worked as a miner and organizer for the social democratic New Democratic Party. He was a member of the United Steelworkers of America during this period. In 1977, Cowan was sent by Manitoba NDP leader Edward Schreyer to the northern riding of Churchill to scout for suitable candidates. Perhaps contrary to Schreyer's expectations, he secured the nomination for himself (despite the fact that he was not yet a Canadian citizen) and was duly returned in the general election that followed, defeating Progressive Conservative Mark Ingebrigtson by about 300 votes. In 1979, Cowan was one of the most prominent supporters of Howard Pawley in the latter's successful bid to succeed Schreyer as party leader. Cowan was re- elected in the general election of 1981 (this time defeating Ingebrigtson by around 1350 votes); the NDP won the election, and he was appointed Minister of Northern Affairs on November 30, 1981, with responsibility for Environmental Management, the Clean Environment Act, the Workers Compensation Act, the Workplace Safety and Health Act, and the Communities Economic Development Fund Act. Following a cabinet shuffle on November 4, 1983, Cowan was named Minister of Co-operative Development and Chairman of the Treasury Board. He was again re-elected without difficulty in the general election of 1986. On April 17, 1986, Cowan was relieved of his position with the Treasury Board and was named government house leader. He continued to serve as Minister of Co-operative Development, and was also the Minister of Native Affairs (without portfolio) responsible for the Natural Gas Supply Act from September 21, 1987 to November 23, 1987. The NDP were unexpectedly defeated in the legislature in 1988, after disgruntled backbencher Jim Walding voted with the opposition in a narrowly divided house. Cowan was one of only twelve New Democrats (in a 57-member house) to be returned in the 1988 general election. In opposition, he opposed the proposed labour reforms of Progressive Conservative Premier Gary Filmon. He chose not to seek re-election in 1990. Cowan is now director of special projects at the Anokiiwin Training Institute, working with aboriginal groups in Manitoba and northwestern Ontario. As of 2003, he was also the chair of the Manitoba Federation of Labour's health and safety committee.

The Manava Sulbasutra is not the oldest (the one by Baudhayana is older), nor is it one of the most important, there being at least three Sulbasutras which are considered more important. Historians place his lifetime at around 750 BC. Manava would have not have been a mathematician in the sense that we would understand it today. Nor was he a scribe who simply copied manuscripts like Ahmes. He would certainly have been a man of very considerable learning but probably not interested in mathematics for its own sake, merely interested in using it for religious purposes. Undoubtedly he wrote the Sulbasutra to provide rules for religious rites and it would appear almost a certainty that Manava himself would be a Hindu priest. The mathematics given in the Sulbasutras is there to enable accurate construction of altars needed for sacrifices. It is clear from the writing that Manava, as well as being a priest, must have been a skilled craftsman. Manava's Sulbasutra, like all the Sulbasutras, contained approximate constructions of circles from rectangles, and squares from circles, which can be thought of as giving approximate values of œÄ. There appear therefore different values of œÄ throughout the Sulbasutra, essentially every construction involving circles leads to a different such approximation. The paper of R.C. Gupta is concerned with an interpretation of verses 11.14 and 11.15 of Manava's work which give œÄ = 25/8 = 3.125.

This text is one of the first major Sanskrit astronomical texts known from the period following the 7th-century works of Brahmagupta and BhƒÅskara I. It generally treats the same astronomical subject matter and demonstrates the same computational techniques as earlier authors, although there are some significant innovations, such that Lalla‚Äôs treatise offers a compromise between the rival astronomical schools of his predecessors, ƒÄryabha·π≠a I and Brahmagupta. It is within the ≈öi·π£yadhƒ´v·πõddhidatantra that the earliest known description of perpetual motion is described.

He later moved to Jakarta, became a member of the Parliament in 1971, first as a member of the Muslim Nahdlatul Ulama Party. After the political fusion which joined all Islamist parties into one party and the withdrawal of Nahdlatul Ulama from politics, he became in 1973 a member of the newly formed Partai Persatuan Pembangunan (PPP). Hamzah served as Minister for Investment under President B. J. Habibie, who replaced Suharto, then resigned that post to lead the PPP in the 1999 elections. He joined the cabinet of President Abdurrahman Wahid, then became the first to quit Wahid's first cabinet, resigning as Minister for People's Welfare after just two months. He became a vocal critic of Wahid, but he is also known for his ability to compromise. By the time of Wahid's impeachment in the summer of 2001, Hamzah was leader of the PPP, then the third-largest party in the Indonesian Parliament. As such, he became the obvious choice for the members of People's Consultative Assembly to fill the vacancy of Vice President's office, as Megawati Sukarnoputri moved up to the Presidency. In the 2004 presidential election, Hamzah was one of the presidential candidates, running with Agum Gumelar. The pair finished last among the five candidates, garnering only 3 percent of the total vote. Connections with militant Islamism A number of journalists and commentators have reported that Hamzah is believed to offer support for militant Muslim groups as a way of gaining political support from them. In 2002, Bill Guerin, in an opinion piece in the Asia Times wrote, \\"Hamzah... is widely seen as blatantly vying for support from among Indonesian Muslims, including the militant groups, to strengthen his run for the presidency in the country's next general elections in 2004.\\" Guerin, Bill, \\"Indonesia: The enemy within\\", 15 October 2007. Hamzah is also reported to be as an apologist for and friend of Abu Bakar Bashir, who is the spiritual leader for the terrorist organization Jemaah Islamiyah. While vice president, Hamzah made a public show of inviting Bashir to dinner, and visited his jihadist pesantren (religious school) in Pondok Ngruki. Hamzah denied that Bashir was connected to terrorism up until Bashir's arrest in October 2002, and was quoted as saying before Bashir's arrest \\"If you want to arrest Abu Bakar Bashir.. you will have to deal with me first.\\" Parkinson, Tony, \\"Jakarta's Day of Reckoning\\" opinion article in The Age, 14 October 2002, accessed 6 April 2007 In October 2002, an article in TIME stated \\"That clerics like Abubakar [Bashir] have powerful military and political allies is no secret: the nation's Vice-President Hamzah Haz is one of them.\\" TIME reported that Hamzah described his relationship with Bashir and Laskar Jihad leader Jafar Umar Thalib as \\"very close\\", but TIME added, \\"many see this relationship as a purely political ploy to woo Muslim voters ahead of the 2004 election.\\" Hamzah, although he \\"has a reputation as a wily politician\\" nevertheless \\"will be remembered for a particularly ill-judged speech before Muslim clerics at Abubakar's Solo boarding school in May [2002]\\", the newsmagazine reported.

The treatise consists of eighteen chapters and was written in the form of verse in Sanskrit. The initial twelve chapters deals with topics related to mathematical astronomy and covers the topics that Indian mathematicians of that period had already worked on. The various topics that have been included in these twelve chapters are: the longitudes of the planets, lunar and solar eclipses, the estimation of eclipses, the lunar crescent, the rising and setting of the planets, association of the planets with each other and with the stars. The next six chapters of the book includes topics such as geometry, geography and algebra, which were applied to calculate the longitudes of the planets. In about twenty verses in the treatise, he gives elaborate rules to solve the indeterminate equation: by = ax + c. These rules have been applied to a number of different cases such as when c has a positive value, when c has a negative value, when the number of the quotients is an even number, when this number of quotients is an odd number, etc. Other contributions to maths Aryabhata II also deduced a method to calculate the cube root of a number, but his method was already given by Aryabhata I, many years earlier. Indian mathematicians were very keen to give the correct sine tables since they played a vital role to calculate the planetary positions as accurately as possible. Aryabhata II played a vital role in it by constructing a sine table, which was accurate up to five decimal places.

Long-term care insurance covers care generally not covered by health insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid. Individuals who require long-term care are generally not sick in the traditional sense but are unable to perform two of the six activities of daily living (ADLs) such as dressing, bathing, eating, toileting, continence, transferring (getting in and out of a bed or chair), and walking. Age is not a determining factor in needing long-term care. About 70 percent of individuals over 65 will require at least some type of long-term care services during their lifetime. About 40% of those receiving long-term care today are between 18 and 64. Once a change of health occurs, long-term care insurance may not be available. Early onset (before 65) Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease occur rarely. Long-term care is an issue because people are living longer. As people age, many times they need help with everyday activities of daily living or require supervision due to severe cognitive impairment. That impacts women even more since they often live longer than men and, by default, become caregivers to others. Benefits Long-term care insurance can cover home care, assisted living, adult daycare, respite care, hospice care, nursing home, Alzheimer's facilities, and home modification to accommodate disabilities. If home care coverage is purchased, long-term care insurance can pay for home care, often from the first day it is needed. It will pay for a visiting or live-in caregiver, companion, housekeeper, therapist or private duty nurse up to seven days a week, 24 hours a day up to the policy benefit maximum. Many experts suggest shopping between the ages of 45 and 55 as part of an overall retirement plan to protect assets from the high costs and burdens of extended health care. Other benefits of long-term care insurance: * Many individuals may feel uncomfortable relying on their children or family members for support, and find that long-term care insurance could help cover out-of-pocket expenses. Without long-term care insurance, the cost of providing these services may quickly deplete the savings of the individual and/or their family. The costs of long-term care differ by region. The U.S. government has an interactive map to estimate the costs by state. * Premiums paid on a long- term care insurance product may be eligible for an income tax deduction. The amount of the deduction depends on the age of the covered person.IRC Sec. 213(d)(10)(A) Benefits paid from a long-term care contract are generally excluded from income. Some states also have deductions or credits and proceeds are always tax-free. * Business deductions of premiums are determined by the type of business. Generally corporations paying premiums for an employee are 100% deductible if not included in employee's taxable income.IRC Sec. 162(I0(1)(B) In the United States, Medicaid will provide long-term care services for the poor or those who spend-down assets because of care and exhaust their assets. In most states, you must spend down to $2000. If there is a living spouse/partner they may keep an additional amount. A welfare program, Medicaid does provide medically necessary services for people with limited resources who \\"need nursing home care but can stay at home with special community care services.\\" However, Medicaid generally does not cover long-term care provided in a home setting or for assisted living. People who need long-term care often prefer care in the home or in a private room in an assisted living facility. Types of policies Private long-term care (LTC) insurance is growing in popularity in the United States. Premiums, however, have risen dramatically in recent years even for existing policyholders. Coverage costs can be expensive, when consumers wait until retirement age to purchase LTC coverage. As they relate to U.S. policies, two types of long-term care policies offered are: * Traditional policies are the most common policies offered. Traditional policy premiums, like automobile insurance premiums, are paid on a continual basis. If unused, no premiums are returned. However, if the policy has a \\"return of premium\\" rider, a death benefit will be paid to a beneficiary if the insured dies at a time when benefits received under the policy are less than the premiums paid to the insurer. The amount of the benefit is equal to the excess of premiums paid over benefits received. * Combination or hybrid policies are a combination of life insurance or an annuity with long term care insurance. Several varieties of these combinations exist. As they relate to U.S. income tax, two types of long-term care policies offered are: * Tax qualified (TQ) policies are the most common policies offered. A TQ policy requires that a person 1) be expected to require care for at least 90 days, and be unable to perform 2 or more activities of daily living (eating, dressing, bathing, transferring, toileting, continence) without substantial assistance (hands-on or standby); or 2) for at least 90 days, need substantial assistance due to a severe cognitive impairment. In either case, a doctor must provide a plan of care. Benefits from a TQ policy are non-taxable. * Non-tax qualified (NTQ) was formerly called traditional long-term care insurance. It often includes a \\"trigger\\" called a \\"medical necessity\\" trigger. This means that the patient's own doctor, or that doctor in conjunction with someone from the insurance company, can state that the patient needs care for any medical reason and the policy will pay. NTQ policies include walking as an activity of daily living and usually only require the inability to perform 1 or more activity of daily living. The Treasury Department has not clarified the status of benefits received under a non-qualified long-term care insurance plan. Therefore, the taxability of these benefits is open to further interpretation. This means that it is possible that individuals who receive benefits under a non-qualified long-term care insurance policy risk facing a large tax bill for these benefits. Fewer non-tax qualified policies are available for sale. One reason is that consumers want to be eligible for the tax deductions available when buying a tax-qualified policy. The tax issues can be more complex than the issue of deductions alone, and it is advisable to seek good counsel on all the pros and cons of a tax-qualified policy versus a non-tax-qualified policy, since the benefit triggers on a good non-tax-qualified policy are better. By law, tax- qualified policies carry restrictions on when the policy holder can receive benefits. One survey found that sixty-five percent of purchasers did not know whether or not the policy they bought was tax qualified.\\"Who buys long‚Äëterm care insurance? A 15‚Äëyear study of buyers and non‚Äëbuyers, 1990‚Äë2005\\" , America's Health Insurance Plans, April 2007 Once a person purchases a policy, the language cannot be changed by the insurance company, and the policy usually is guaranteed renewable for life. It can never be canceled by the insurance company for health reasons, but can be canceled for non-payment. Most benefits are paid on a reimbursement basis and a few companies offer indemnity-based per-diem benefits at a higher rate. Most policies cover care only in the continental United States. Policies that cover care in select foreign countries usually only cover nursing care and do so at a rated benefit. Group policies may have provisions for non-restricted or open enrollment periods and underwriting may be required. Group plans may or may not be guaranteed renewable or tax qualified. Some group plans include language allowing the insurance company to replace the policy with a similar policy and to change the premiums at that time. Some group plans can be canceled by the insurance company. To compensate for the higher insurance risk group plans may have higher deductibles and lower benefits than individual plans. Some group plans have a 3 ADL (activities of daily living) requirement for nursing care. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) provides certain former employees, retirees, spouses, former spouses, and dependent children the right to temporary continuation of health coverage at group rates.FAQs About COBRA continuation health coverage from DOL Retirement systems such as CalPERS may offer long-term care insurance similar to a group plan. These organizations are not regulated by the state insurance departments. They can increase rates and make changes to policies without state scrutiny and approval. Long-term care insurance rates are determined by six main factors: the person's age, the daily (or monthly) benefit, how long the benefits pay, the elimination period, inflation protection, and the health rating (preferred, standard, sub-standard). Most companies will offer couples and multi-life discounts on individual policies. Some companies define \\"couples\\" not only to spouses, but also to two people who meet criteria for living together in a committed relationship and sharing basic living expenses. The average age of purchasers has dropped from 68 years in 1990 to 61 years in 2005, and the number of purchasers who are under age 65 has increased significantly. Most companies offer multiple premium payment modes: annual, semi-annual, quarterly, and monthly. Companies may add a percentage for more frequent payment than annual. Options such as spousal survivorship, non- forfeiture, restoration of benefits and return of premium are available with most plans. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 makes Partnership plans available to all states.Deficit Reduction Act from CMS Partnership provides \\"lifetime asset protection\\" from the Medicaid spend-down requirement. As of March 2014, 41 states had active Long Term Care Insurance Partnership programs. Benefit eligibility and deductibles Most policies pay benefits when the policyholder needs help with two or more of six ADLs or when a cognitive impairment is present. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services all tax-qualified long-term care insurance plans have the same trigger. Most policies have an elimination period or waiting period similar to a deductible. This is the period of time that you pay for care before your benefits are paid. Elimination days may be from 30 to 120 days after a long- term care incident, such as a fall or illness. Some policies require intended claimants to provide proof of 30 to 120 service days of paid care before any benefits will be paid. In some cases, the option may be available to select zero elimination days when covered services are provided in the home in accordance with a Plan of Care. A policyholder can select a maximum daily or monthly benefit. This is the maximum the insurance company will pay toward care on either a daily or monthly basis https://www.ltcnews.com/resources/faq/what-are-the-major-parts-of-a-long-term- care-insurance-policy LTC riders in Canada LTC Insurance riders generally available in Canadian policies include: * ROPD ‚Äì Return of premium on death.

Care insurance in Germany In Germany there are two different kinds of care insurance: mandatory care insurance and voluntary, private care insurance. The German laws oblige the people to have a basic care insurance. It is one of five mandatory insurances, including health, accident, unemployment and pension insurance. As usual in the German public insurance system costs are evenly split between employers and employees. There are three types of private care insurance: 1\\\\. The most expensive form of private care insurance is like a life insurance. It pays you a monthly pension when the insured needs to be taken care of, no matter what the care actually costs. When making the contract you can choose how much the insurance pays each month, depending on the care level. 2\\\\. Another form of private care insurance pays a certain percentage of the actual cost after the mandatory care insurance has paid. Here you can decide on the percentage that is being paid, depending on the care level. The advantage of this type of insurance is that it pays more money when the care costs more, so the risk of raised prices is lower for the insured. 3\\\\. The most common type of private care insurance pays a certain amount of money for each day where the insured is being taken care of. Long-Term Care insurance in the United States Some 7 million individuals have some form of long-term care insurance. The vast majority have what is referred to as traditional, or health-based, LTC insurance. The opposite is true for new policy sales. Some 350,000 new policies are sold each year with 84 percent being linked-benefit or life insurance policies that include a LTC benefit. https://www.aaltci.org/news/long-term-care-insurance-association-news/long- term-care-insurance-purchased-by-350000-americans-in-2018 Long term care insurance new policy sales for 2018 In the U.S., the nation's long-term care insurance companies paid out a record $11 billion in claims in 2019 to some 310,000 policyholders. 2019 Long-Term Care Insurance Claims[https://www.aaltci.org/news/long-term-care-insurance-association- news/long-term-care-insurance-paid-claim-paymernts-rise-by-35-percent%5D See also *Activities of daily living *CLASS Act *Continuing Care Retirement Community *Health insurance in the United States *Long Term Care Benefit Plan References External links * What to look for in a LTC policy from Consumer Reports (February 2011) * U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Long Term Care information * American Association for Long Term Care Insurance - AALTCI * National Institute on Health * National Association of Insurance Commissions LTC Section * US Department of Health & Human Services Aging, Caregiving & LTC * Medicaid Eligibility Category:Caregiving Category:Elderly care Category:Health insurance Category:Medicare and Medicaid (United States) ","title":"Long-term care insurance"},{"id":"1160193","text":"Brahmadeva (1060‚Äì1130) was an Indian mathematician.

Early life ≈örƒ´pati's father was Nagadeva (sometimes written as Namadeva) and Nagadeva's father, Sripati's paternal grandfather, was Kesava. ≈örƒ´pati was a follower of the teaching of Lalla writing on astrology, astronomy and mathematics. His mathematical work was undertaken with applications to astronomy in mind, for example a study of spheres. His work on astronomy was undertaken to provide a basis for his astrology. ≈örƒ´pati was the most prominent Indian mathematicians of the 11th century. Work Among ≈örƒ´pati's works are: Dhikotidakarana written in 1039, a work of twenty verses on solar and lunar eclipses; Dhruvamanasa written in 1056, a work of 105 verses on calculating planetary longitudes, eclipses and planetary transits; Siddhantasekhara a major work on astronomy in 19 chapters; and Ganitatilaka an incomplete arithmetical treatise in 125 verses based on a work by Sridhara. The titles of Chapters 13, 14, and 15 of the Siddhantasekhara are Arithmetic, Algebra and On the Sphere. Chapter 13 consists of 55 verses on arithmetic, Measurement, and shadow reckoning. It is probable that the lost portion of the arithmetic treatise Ganitatilaka consisted essentially of verses 19‚Äì55 of this chapter. The 37 verses of Chapter 14 on algebra state various rules of algebra without proof. These are given in verbal form without algebraic symbols. In verses 3, 4 and 5 of this chapter ≈örƒ´pati gave the rules of signs for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, square root, cube and cube root of positive and negative quantities.

Other mathematics included in ≈örƒ´pati's work includes, in particular, rules for the solution of simultaneous indeterminate equations of the first degree that are similar to those given by Brahmagupta ≈örƒ´pati obtained more fame in astrology than in other areas and it is fair to say that he considered this to be his most important contributions. He wrote the Jyotisaratnamala which was an astrology text in twenty chapters based on the Jyotisaratnakosa of Lalla. ≈örƒ´pati wrote a commentary on this work in Marathi and it is one of the oldest works to have survived that is written in that language.

It was enormously popular, as the large number of manuscripts, commentaries, and imitations attests. Genethlialogy was the science of casting nativities and it was the earliest branch of astrology which claimed to be able to predict the course of a person's life based on the positions of the planets and of the signs of the zodiac at the moment the person was born or conceived. There is one other work on astrology the Daivajnavallabha which some historians claim was written by ≈örƒ´pati while other claim that it is the work of Varahamihira.

The Icelandic Saga of Erik the Red and the Greenland Saga characterized Helluland as a land of flat stones (Old Norse: hella). Most scholars agree that Helluland corresponds to Baffin Island in the present-day Canadian territory of Nunavut.J√≥nas Kristj√°nsson et al. (2012) \\"Falling into V√≠nland\\", Acta Archaeologica 83, pp. 145-177 From the testimony of the sagas, the Norse explorers probably made contact with the native Dorset culture of the region, people whom the sagas term skr√¶lings. Historians suggest the contact had no major cultural ramifications for either side. Patricia Sutherland, who worked at the Canadian Museum of Civilization until she was fired in 2012, found in the museum's collections yarn collected in archaeological digs on Baffin Island that corresponded to that found in Norse settlements in Greenland, which led her to explore in depth the potential that the Norse had settled on Baffin Island. Over a number of years searching in collections and digging at sites such as Tanfield Valley, she found numerous artifacts, such as tally sticks, signs of iron and bronze metallurgy and whetstones used for sharpening metal tools, and European-style masonry and turf construction, which indicated to her that the Vikings had been on Baffin for an extended period and likely had an established trading relationship with the Dorset natives in the area. > Sutherland's new findings further strengthen the case for a Viking camp on > Baffin Island. \\"While her evidence was compelling before, I find it > convincing now,\\" said James Tuck, professor emeritus of archaeology, ... at > Memorial University.\\" Sutherland and the Helluland Archaeology Project among others have identified several potential pre-Columbian European archaeological sites including Tanfield Valley, Avayalik at the far north of the Labrador Peninsula, Willows Island at the southern part of Baffin Island, Pond Inlet (Nunguvik) in the far north of Baffin Island. When Sutherland was asked if she might have been fired from the Canadian Museum of Civilization, now the Canadian Museum of History, because her research was out of step with government views of Canadian history, Sutherland agreed. In 2018, Michele Hayeur Smith of Brown University, who specializes in the study of ancient textiles, wrote that she does not think the ancient Arctic people, the Dorset and Thule, needed to be taught how to spin yarn \\"It's a pretty intuitive thing to do.\\" Journal of Archaeological Science, August 2018: > \\". . . the date received on Sample 4440b from Nanook clearly indicates that > sinew was being spun and plied at least as early, if not earlier, than yarn > at this site.

Fitzhugh, Director of the Arctic Studies Center at the Smithsonian Institution, and a Senior Scientist at the National Museum of Natural History, wrote that there is insufficient published evidence to support Sutherland's claims, and that the Dorset were using spun cordage by the 6th century. In 1992, Elizabeth Wayland Barber wrote that a piece of three-ply yarn that dates to the Paleolithic era, that ended about 10,000 BP, was found at the Lascaux caves in France. This yarn consisted of three s-twist strands that were z-plied, much like the way a three-ply yarn is made now, the Baffin Island yarn was a simple two-ply yarn.Barber, Elizabeth Wayland (1992) Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean, Princeton University Press, \\"We now have at least two pieces of evidence that this important principle of twisting for strength dates to the Palaeolithic.

It is a whole-muscle salume, dry cured, and typically sliced very thinly. It is similar to the more widely known cured ham or prosciutto, because they are both pork-derived cold-cuts used in similar dishes. It is not brined as ham typically is. Terminology This cut is typically called capocollo or coppa in much of Italy and Corsica. This name is a compound of the words capo (\\"head\\") and collo (\\"neck\\"). Regional terms include capicollo (Campania and Calabria) and capicollu (Corsica). Outside of Italy and Corsica, terms include bondiola or bondiola curada in Argentina and capicola or capicolla in North America.Canadian Oxford Dictionary 2nd ed., 2004. The pronunciation \\"gabagool\\" has been used by Italian Americans in the New York City area and elsewhere in the Northeast, based on the pronunciation of \\"capicola\\" in working-class dialects of 19th- and early 20th-century Neapolitan.Dan Nosowitz. \\"How Capicola Became Gabagool: The Italian New Jersey Accent, Explained.\\" Atlas Obscura. 5 November, 2015.

Manufacture and use In its production, capocollo is first lightly seasoned often with red and sometimes white wine, garlic, and a variety of herbs and spices that differs depending on region. The meat is then salted (and was traditionally massaged) and stuffed into a natural casing, and hung for up to six months to cure. Sometimes the exterior is rubbed with hot paprika before being hung and cured. Capocollo is essentially the pork counterpart of the air-dried, cured beef bresaola. It is widely available wherever significant Italian communities occur, due to commercially produced varieties. The slow-roasted Piedmontese version is called coppa cotta. Capocollo is esteemed for its delicate flavor and tender, fatty texture, and is often more expensive than most other salumi. In many countries, it is often sold as a gourmet food item. It is usually sliced thin for use in antipasto or sandwiches such as muffulettas, Italian grinders and subs, and panini, as well as some traditional Italian pizza.

Its leader was David Salmon. Early history The party was registered by members of the former Reform Party of Canada on August 24, 1989 not to contest general elections, but to contest elections held by the Government of Alberta to select its nominees to the Senate of Canada, a body that is appointed by the Governor General of Canada on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The party contested Senate nominee elections, the 1989 Senate election and the 1998 Senate election. The Reform Party of Alberta nominated and ran only three candidates in its history: Stanley Waters, Ted Morton and Bert Brown. The other and primary purpose was to keep Reform focused as a federal party instead of being distracted by provincial campaigns. Nonetheless, there was considerable agitation at this time by some Albertan Reform members to form an active provincial party that could challenge Don Getty's unpopular Progressive Conservative government. In some opinion polls, the dormant Reform Party actually placed ahead of the Tories. When Ralph Klein was elected to lead the PCs in 1992, enthusiasm for an alternative right wing party that might split the vote with the Tories and benefit the surging Liberals quickly faded. Unlike what is the case in most Canadian provinces, an Albertan political party did not lose its registration if it does not nominate candidates during a general election, de-registration only happens if the party ceases to file financial statements with the electoral office. The Reform Party did not nominate any candidates for election to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 2004 Alberta general election, due to a change in the rules the party registration was withdrawn by the chief electoral officer. The federal Reform Party's successor, the Canadian Alliance, was also not interested in forming provincial wings, but unlike Reform, the CA did not register the Alliance name with provincial electoral officers during its short history. As a result, a section of the Albertan CA membership formed the Alberta Alliance in 2002. Unlike Reform, the Alberta Alliance was an active political party‚Äîit fielded a full slate of candidates in the 2004 general election, and won one seat in the Legislature. The Reform Party of Alberta was deregistered after the election, along with the Equity Party. List of Leaders *Preston Manning (1989 - 2000) *David Salmon (2000 - 2004) 1989 Senatorial financial statement According to the official archives of Elections Alberta, in the 1989 Senate election, the Stan Waters campaign received $147,822 in campaign donations, $19,000 transferred from the Reform Party of Alberta, and $23,558.96 was from fundraising functions, for a total of $190,380.96 in campaign period revenue. Expenses for the campaign were $197,641.00, resulting in a deficit of $7,260.04. Note: Future party leader David Salmon was Stan Waters official agent.

She served as the flagship of Admiral Franklin Buchanan, commander of the Mobile Squadron, after her commissioning. She was captured in 1864 by the Union Navy during the Battle of Mobile Bay and then participated in the Union's subsequent Siege of Fort Morgan. Tennessee was decommissioned after the war and sold in 1867 for scrap. Design, description and construction Tennessee was built at Selma, Alabama, where she was commissioned on February 16, 1864. towed her to Mobile where she was fitted out. Tennessee was laid down in October 1862, hull and other woodwork turned out by Henry D. Bassett, who launched her the following February, ready for towing to Mobile to be engined and armed. Her steam plant came from the steamer Alonzo Child. Her casemate design differed materially from and , but iron plate was the same 2 by 10 in (50 by 250 mm) as used on CSS Huntsville and CSS Tuscaloosa but triple thickness instead of double; her iron plate was made by the Shelby Iron Company in Shelby, Alabama. A fearsome detail of her defensive armament was a \\"hot water attachment to her boilers for repelling boarders, throwing one water stream from forward of the casemate and one aft.\\" The vicissitudes implicit in creating such an ironclad are graphically conveyed by Admiral Franklin Buchanan, writing September 20, 1863 to Confederate Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory: > The work on the Tennessee has progressed for some weeks past, under Mr. > Pierce, as fast as the means in his power would permit.

Lieutenant (later Commander) James D. Johnston, CSN, commander of CSS Tennessee Tennessee became flagship of Admiral Buchanan, and served gallantly in action in the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. On that morning Tennessee and wooden gunboats , , and , steamed into combat against Admiral David G. Farragut's powerful fleet of four ironclad monitors and 14 wooden steamers. Unable to ram the Union ships because of their superior speed, Tennessee delivered a vigorous fire on the Federals at close range. The Confederate gunboats were sunk or dispersed. Farragut's fleet steamed up into the bay and anchored. Buchanan might have held Tennessee under the fort's protection but steamed after the Federal fleet and engaged despite overwhelming odds. The ram became the target for the entire Union fleet. Tennessee was rammed by several ships, and her vulnerable steering chains (which, oddly, lay in exposed trenches on the after deck) were carried away by the heavy gunfire. Unable to maneuver, Tennessee was battered repeatedly by heavy solid shot from her adversaries. With two of her men killed, Admiral Buchanan and eight others wounded, and increasingly severe damage being inflicted on her, Tennessee was forced to surrender. USS Tennessee Carte de visite image of the ship Immediately following her capture and repair, Tennessee was commissioned in the United States Navy, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Pierre Giraud in command. The ironclad participated in the Federal assault on Fort Morgan on August 23 which resulted in the fort's capitulation that same day. That autumn, she moved from Mobile, AL to New Orleans, LA for repairs before joining the Mississippi Squadron. She served on the Mississippi river through the end of the war in April 1865 and briefly thereafter. On August 19, 1865, Tennessee was placed out of commission and was laid up at New Orleans. There, she remained until November 27, 1867 when she was sold at auction to J. F. Armstrong for scrapping. Though the remainder of the vessel was scrapped, two 7-inch Brooke rifles and two 6.4-inch Brooke rifles were preserved and are still on display in the Old weapons exhibit in East Willard Park at the Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. One of her 6.4-inch (160 mm) double-banded Brooke rifled cannon is on display at the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief U. S. Atlantic Command at the Norfolk, Virginia Naval base. One of her 7-inch Brooke rifles is on display at the city hall of Selma, Alabama where it was cast.

The Duenos inscription is one of the earliest known Old Latin texts, variously dated from the 7th to the 5th century BC.Osvaldo Sacchi, \\"Il trivaso del Quirinale\\", in Revue Interantionale de Droit de l'Antiquit√©, 2001, p. 277; citing: Attilio Degrassi, Inscriptiones Latinae Liberae Rei Publicae, 1, 1957; Arthur Gordon, \\"Notes on the Duenos-Vase Inscription in Berlin\\", California Studies in Classical Antiquity, Vol. 8, 1975, pp. 53‚Äì72; Giovanni Colonna, \\"Duenos\\", in Studi Etruschi, 47, 1979, pp. 163‚Äì172; Brent Vine, \\"A Note on the Duenos Inscription\\", University of California at Los Angeles. It is inscribed on the sides of a kernos, in this case a trio of small globular vases adjoined by three clay struts. It was found by Heinrich Dressel in 1880 on the Quirinal Hill in Rome. The kernos is part of the collection of the Staatliche Museen in Berlin (inventory no. 30894,3). The inscription is written right to left in three units, without spaces to separate words. It is difficult to translate, as some letters are hard to distinguish, particularly since they cannot always be deduced by context. The absence of spaces causes additional difficulty in assigning the letters to the respective words. The Duenos Inscription Text and translations There have been many proposed translations advanced by scholars since the discovery of the kernos; by 1983, more than fifty different explanations of the meaning had been put forward.Arthur E. Gordon, Illustrated Introduction to Latin Epigraphy, 1983, p. 77. Due to the lack of a large body of archaic Latin, and the method by which Romans abbreviated their inscriptions, scholars have not been able to produce a singular translation that has been accepted by historians as accurate. Below is the transcription and one of many possible interpretations:S. Warmington, 54 ff.; and H. Eichner, in: Die Sprache, 34, 1988-1990, 207 ff. :a. The direct unicase transcription :b. Direct transcription, in lowercase, with possible macrons and word breaks :c. A speculative interpretation and translation into Classical Latin :d. An English gloss (approximate translation/interpretation) of the Classical Latin rendering Line 1: :a. :b. iouesƒÅt deivos qoi mƒìd mitƒÅt, nei tƒìd end≈ç cosmis virc≈ç siƒìd :c. Iurat deos qui me mittit, ni [erga te] comis virgo sit :d. 'The person who sends me prays to the gods, lest the girl be not kind towards thee' Line 2: :a. :b. as(t) tƒìd noisi o(p)petoit esiƒÅi pƒÅkƒÅ riuois :c. at te [... uncertain ...] paca rivis :d. 'without thee [...] calm with [these] rivers' Line 3: :a. :b. duenos mƒìd fƒìced en mƒÅn≈çm (m)einom duen≈çi nƒì mƒìd malo(s) stat≈çd :c. Bonus me fecit in manum [...] bono, ne me malus [clepito] :d. 'A good man made me (in good intention?) for a good man; may I not be stolen by an evil man.' An interpretation set out by Warmington and Eichner, renders the complete translation as follows, though not with certainty: #It is sworn with the gods, whence I'm issued: If a maiden does not smile at you, #nor is strongly attracted to you, then soothe her with this fragrance! #Someone good has filled me for someone good and well-mannered, and not shall I be obtained by someone bad. Notes Duenos is an older form of Classical Latin ('good'), just as Classical ('war') is from Old Latin duellum. Some scholars posit Duenos as a proper name, instead of merely an adjective. The Praenestine fibula is thought by some to be the earliest surviving evidence of the Latin language dating to the 7th century BC, but has been alleged by Margherita Guarducci to have been a well-informed hoax; however, the evidence is only circumstantial and there are no clear indications pointing to a forgery. Ultimately, these claims have been disproven, as a new analysis performed in 2011 declared it to be genuine \\"beyond any reasonable doubt\\". Epigraphic note The inscription (CIL I 2nd 2, 4) is scratched along the side of the body of three vases made of dark brown bucchero, connected with each other by short cylindric arms. It is written from right to left spiralling downwards about times. The letters are written upside-down for a reader who looks at the inscription from a level position; this has been explained by Aldo Luigi ProsdocimiAldo Luigi Prosdocimi, \\"Studi sul latino arcaico\\", in Studi Etruschi, 47, 1979, pp. 173‚Äì221. as due to the fact that the inscription was meant to be read from above, not from a sideways position. Some letters are written in an archaic fashion that appears influenced by the Greek alphabet.J. E. Sandys, S. G. Campbell, Latin Epigraphy: an Introduction to the study of Latin Inscriptions 1974, p. 40‚Äì41. There are signs of corrections in the two or of and and in the of . Three distinct sections are individuated by spaces after and . There are neither spaces delimiting words nor signs of interpunction. The earliest interpunction to appear was syllabic. As it appeared only in the 7th century BC, the inscription should be more ancient.Giuliano and Larissa Bonfante Lingua e cultura degli Etruschi Torino, 1985, p. 63. The inscription is made up by two distinct parts or sections, the second one beginning with the word .E. Dressel \\"Di una antichissima iscrizione latina graffita sopra un vaso votivo rinvenuta a Roma\\" in Annali dell' Istituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica 52, 1880, p. 180. It was found in a votive deposit (favissa). It belongs to the kind known as speaking inscriptions, widely in use in the Archaic period. Some scholars consider the object to be of good quality and reflecting the high social status of the owner. Others consider it common. Site of the find The vase was bought from an antiquarian by Heinrich Dressel shortly after its find. It was discovered in 1880 by workers who were digging to lay the foundation of a building near the newly opened Via Nazionale, in the valley between the Quirinal Hill and the Viminal Hill. More precisely it was found on the south slope of the Quirinal, near the church of San Vitale, Rome. Dressel was told the place was supposed to have been a burial site.Br√©al; Gordon. Archeologist Filippo Coarelli has advanced the hypothesis that the object might have been placed in the votive deposit of one of the temples of goddess Fortuna dedicated by king Servius Tullius, perhaps the one known as Fortuna Publica or Citerior, i.e. located on the side of the Quirinal near to Rome. Her festival recurred on the nonae of April (April 5).Filippo Coarelli Il Foro Boario p. 289 ff.; Plutarch Quaest. Romanae 74 and De Fortuna Romana 10 However June 11, the festival day of the Matralia, which was originally devoted to Mater Matuta, was also the day of the Fortuna Virgo, ritually associated with the passage of girls from adolescence into adulthood and married life.Arnobius Adversus Nationes II 67; Aurelius Augustinus De Civitate Dei IV 11; Ovid Fasti VI 221; Mario Torelli Lavinio e Roma. Riti iniziatici tra archeologia e storia 1984, p. 53 ff. and 117 ff.; Giovanni Colonna \\"Duenos\\" in Studi Etruschi 47 (1979) p. 168; Robert E. A. Palmer \\"Roman shrines of female chastity from the struggle of chastity to the papacy of Innocent I\\" in Rivista Storica dell'Antichit√† 4 (1974) p. 129 ff. (also available as a monograph from the publisher P√†tron) who thinks the sanctuary of the votive deposit should be that of a Fortuna Bona Dea much more ancient than the ŒïœçŒµŒªœÄŒπœÇ and of purely Roman tradition. Kurt Latte R√∂mische Religionsgeschichte Munich, 1960, p. 228 ff. excludes the name of Bona Dea as a translation of a Greek theonym. Overview of the linguistic research The antiquity of the document is generally acknowledged. The language shows archaic characters in morphology, phonetics and syntax. The absence of u after q would testify to its greater antiquity comparatively to the inscription of the cippus of the Forum, also known as Lapis Niger (CIL I 1).G. Pennisi \\"Il tri-vaso di Duenos\\" in Studi Latini e Italiani 1992 p. 14. =First section= For the sake of convenience of interpretation, the text is usually divided into two sections, the first one containing the first two units and ending with . The two sections show a relative syntactic and semantic independence. Many attempts have been made at deciphering the text. In the 1950s the inscription had been interpreted mainly on the basis of (and in relation to) the supposed function of the vases, considered either as containers for a love philter or of beauty products: the text would then mockingly threaten the owner about his behaviour towards the vase itself or try to attract a potential buyer.Emilio Peruzzi \\"L'iscrizione di Duenos \\" in La Parola del Passato 13 (1958) p. 328 ff.: the author supposes the object is a love toy and the inscription would be a playful warning to the owner not turn down the object itself, i.e. \\"he who turns me upside down (mitat) prays the gods that the girl should not give you her favours lest you want to be satisfied through the workings of Tuteria\\": Tuteria would then be a proper name and the object the work of an enchantress that exercised her magic art to get the lost lover back for a female customer of hers; E. Gjerstad \\"The Duenos vase\\" in Kung. Vitt. och Antikvitets Akademiens Handlingen (1959) pp. 133‚Äì143 supposed the object were a container for beauty products and interpreted the text as: \\"Iurat deos qui me mittit: 'Ne in te comis virgo sit asted, nisi ope utens ei pacari vis'. Bonus me fecit in bonum atque bono, ne me malus dato!\\" , i.e. \\" 'Thy girl shall not be amiable to thee, unless thou befriend her by using (my) assistance' Good man has made me for a good purpose and for the benefit of a good man; may not a bad man present me!\\" This is the so-called erotic line of interpretation which found supporters until the eighties.Filippo Coarelli, Il Foro Boario, 1988, p. 289 ff. Tuteria = Tutela would be a theonym, i.e. one of the many personifications of Fortuna, perhaps the Œ§œçœáŒ∑ ŒïœçŒµŒªœÄŒπœÇ of the vicus Longus: the meaning of the text would be that of a girl forced to be complacent for the effect of the moderating intervention of a deity in whose sanctuary the vase was dedicated. T. Bolelli. \\"De antiquissima inscriptione quae Dueni nuncupatur annotationes\\", in Cipriano, Di Giovine, and Mancini (eds.) Miscellanea di studi linguistici in onore di W. Belardi. 1 (1984) pp. 207‚Äì214: \\"Swears for the gods he who sells me that, if the girl is not nice towards you, at least she shall remain with you (i.e. you shall not lose her) lest you want make peace (with her) through the workings of Tuteria (an enchantress).\\" During the 1960s Georges Dum√©zil proposed a new line of thought in the interpreting of the text. He remarked the inconsistency of the previous interpretations both with the solemnity of the opening formula (\\"Iovesat deivos qoi med mitat\\": 'He swears for the gods who sends /delivers me') and with the site of the find. Dum√©zil's interpretation was: \\"If it happens that the girl is not nice to you/ has no easy relationship with you (\\"nei ted endo cosmis virco sied\\" = \\"ne in te (=erga te) cosmis virgo sit\\"), we shall have the obligation of bringing her and you into good harmony, accord, agreement (\\"asted noisi ... pakari vois\\"=\\"at sit nobis ... pacari vobis\\"). The transmission of the object would be expressed by the words qoi med mitat. The story mirrored in the text would thus depict a custom deeply rooted in Roman society that is described by Plautus in the scene of the Menaechmi in which the tutor of the virgo or his representatives formally give a suretyship about her attitude towards a man.Georges Dum√©zil, \\"La deuxi√®me ligne de l' \\"inscription de Duenos\\" in Latomus 102 1969, pp. 244-255; id. Id√©es romaines, Paris, 1969, pp. 12‚Äì28; It. tr. p. 25.In fact this line of interpretation, based on the reading of toiteisai as related to tutela (ward, guardianship) either as a noun (ope tutelae) or an adjective tuteria (ope tuteria = ope tutoria), had already been proposed in 1934 by philologist and literary critic Antonino Pagliaro, who interpreted the segment as meaning: 'unless [noisi = nisi] you will [vois from volo 'I want'] consider yourself satisfied by the exercise of the marital potestas'. He understood ope tuteria as referring to the potestas exercised by the husband through the manus maritalis, which would be equated to a sort of ward, tutela. Cf. \\"La cosiddetta iscrizione di Dueno\\" in Atene e Roma 3:2, 1934, pp. 162‚Äì175. Dum√©zil's interpretation though was fraught with linguistic problems. Apart from the value of the before , which he considered meaningless or an error of the incisor, the only possible meaning of ope in Latin is 'by the power or force of', and it governs a word in the genitive case. Thence the only governing word could be the group : this would then be an exception to the rule of the genitive of the themes in -a, which does not end in -as as expected, an archaism perhaps in Dum√©zil's view. would then denote the means by which the nois(i), 'we', would have the authority of establishing peace between the 'vois' 'you' (the couple) of the main relationship justifying the delivery of the vase.Cf. Georges Dum√©zil, Id√©es romaines p. 15. Dum√©zil thinks of the involvement of more than one tutor for each party in order to explain the two plurals nois(i) and vois. Lastly the ending presents difficulties. It might derive from an archaic -e-s-la as proposed by H. Osthoff in the formation of Latin abstract namesH. Osthoff, \\"Die Suffixform -sla- vornehmlich im Germanischen\\", in Paul und Braunes Beitrage 3, (1876) pp. 335‚Äì347, partic. p. 336. with an assimilation of the liquid into an i. Another possibility would be to interpret the suffix -ela as -e-la, i.e. as a female derivation of an ancient neuter -el attested in Hittite.Cf. √âmile Benveniste, Origine de la formation de noms en indoeurop√©en, Paris, 1962‚Äì1966, p. 325. This would entail admitting the incisor made two errors. Antonino Pagliaro understood the word as an adjective from noun tutela, ope tuteria, i.e. ope tutoria in classical Latin: the word would thence be an attribute in the ablative.Antonino Pagliaro, above, pp. 162 ff.; cf. above note. Dum√©zil's contribution and the location of the find gave researchers grounds to pursue their work of interpretation in the same direction, i.e. of its significance as a token of legal obligation. The efforts have centred on deciphering of the last segment of the first section, . As already mentioned above, the cult of Fortuna Virgo, celebrated on the day of the Matralia, was related to the role of girls who became married women. The passage saw girls as completely passive subjects both during the archaic period and great part of the republican: the matrimonial exchange was conducted, as far as legally relevant profiles were concerned, by the subjects who had potestas on the woman and by the future husband (or he/those who had potestas over him). This is testified by the fact the virgo had no right of pronouncing the nupta verba.Festus s.v. Nupta verba, p. 174 L; Paulus exc. Festi s.v. Nupta verba, p. 175 L.G. Colonna, Duenos, in SE 1979, p. 168; R. E. A. Palmer, 1974, p. 129 ff.; K. Latte, p. 228 ff. The passage which presents the greatest difficulties is the central group of letters in the string . Proposed interpretations include: iubet orders for ; futuitioni sexual intercourse for ,Vittore Pisani Manuale storico della lingua latina Torino, 1948-1950, p. 9: the tutors would guarantee the sexual disponibility/acquiescence of the girl. the cut / or / so that would be the only recognisable Latin word. Dum√©zil attributes a peculiar semantic value to the syllabic group : a moral instrument that is nothing else than a form of the power the males of a family group (father, tutors) exercised on a girl, i.e. a variant or alteration of the word tutelae, similar to tu(i)tela. Since this interpretation has been proposed no critic has been able to disprove it. Authoritative scholars on the grounds of the lexeme toitesiai have proposed a theonym (Coarelli), a feminine proper name Tuteria (Peruzzi, Bolelli), or even a gentilicium, the gens Titur(n)ia (Simon and Elboj) mentioned by Cicero.Cicero Ad Famil. XIII 39. In the 1990s, two further contributions have discussed once again the interpretation of the second part of the first grapheme, particularly morpheme toitesiai. Even though doubts have been cast over its correspondence with the technical Roman legal word tutela, Dum√©zil intuition of recognising in the destination of the vase a juridical function, namely a matrimonial sponsio, was accepted and taken on.

Pennisi, \\"Il tri-vaso di Duenos\\", in Studi Latini e Italiani, 1992, p. 7‚Äì44. reconstructs the text as follows: \\"Iovesat deivos qoi med mitat: nei ted cosmis virgo sied ast ednoisi opetoi pakari vois. Duenos med feced en manom einom duenoi ne med malos tatod\\". Segment is deciphered recurring to Homeric Œ≠ŒµŒ¥ŒΩŒ± in the meaning of nuptial gifts and the speaking token would be a marriage compact or promise by a young man in love to a girl to whom the vase is presented as a gift. The inscription would thence exhibit an oath structure consisting in an archaic form of coemptio: \\"Swears for the gods he who buys me\\": mitat = *emitat (the future bridegroom would be speaking in the third person). Then passing to the second person the compact would be set out in the second line by the offering of the nuptial gifts as a guarantee. The third line would complete the legal formula of the compact (Duenos / ne med malos tatod). Leo PeppeLeo Peppe, \\"Storie di parole, storie di istituti sul diritto matrimoniale arcaico\\", in Studia et Documenta Historiae et Iuris 1997, pp. 123 ff. has proposed to interpret the inscription as a primitive form of matrimonial coemptio different from that presented in Gaius, consisting in a cumulative acceptance that included both the legal aspects concerning the transmission of the dotal assets and the religious ones inherent in the matrimonial cults and rites. F. Marco Simon and G. Fontana Elboj (autopsy) confirmed the interpretation of the previous proposals that see in the vase the symbol of a marriage compact. The authors ground their interpretation on the segment instead of . They therefore identified a root *o-it (composed by prefix *o and lexeme *i-, cf. Latin eo) related to classic Latin utor, and suffix -esios/a (cf. Valesios of the Lapis Satricanus and Leucesie of the carmen Saliare). The substantive oitesiai would be thus related to the semantic field of utor i.e. the concept of utilitas. Therefore, the text should be divided as: asted noisi; opet otesiai pakari vois. Opet would be an articulatory fusion between the dative opi and conjunction et. The whole text should thus be understood as: Ni erga te virgo comis sit, asted nobis; (iurat) opi et utilitati pangi vois, 'if the girl is not to your taste/agreeable to you, let her go back to us; (he swears) to give you guarantee about your disturb and your interest'. The segment oitesiai could be also understood as utensilium referred to the vase itself as a token of suretiship or usus in the technical legal sense of Roman marriage as a way of providing a guarantee. The last two hypotheses are, however, considered unacceptable by the authors on the grounds that no genitive marker is to be found in the segment oitesiai.F. Marco Simon and G. Fontana Elboj, \\"Sponsio matrimonial en la Roma arcaica\\", in Revue International de Droit de l'Antiquit√© 43, 1996, pp. 232‚Äì234. The proposed interpretation would find support in its strict analogy with a passage of Terentius's Hecyra (vv. 136‚Äì151), in which a story similar to that supposedly recorded on the vase is described. The text would thus be the undertaking of an obligation concerning the eventuality that the girl go back to her family of origin, should she be not liked by the bridegroom (asted endo cosmis virco sied, asted noisi). Even after the last two contributions related above, Sacchi acknowledges that all attempts at interpreting the segment remain conjectural. Dum√©zil's hypothesis of a protoform of tutela, though attractive and plausible, remains unconfirmed. =Juridical note on the matrimonial sponsio= Although there are still obscure points in the interpretation of line two, it is generally accepted that the text contains the formula of an oath. On the archaic oath and its juridical value there is large agreement among scholars. It looks also probable that the object should have a religious implication: an instrument permeated by religious ritualism, as the oath could well be employed in legal practice at the time of the object, as seems supported by linguistic analysis.Emil Benveniste, Le vocabulaire des institutions indoeuropeennes, Italian translation, 1976, vol. II, pp. 367‚Äì375; Giacomo Devoto, \\"Parole giuridiche\\", in Scritti minori I, 1958, p. 100; Osvaldo Sacchi, \\"Il trivaso del Quirinale\\", in Revue Interantionale de Droit de l'Antiquit√©, 2001, p. 301 The usage of the oath in archaic times as an instrument of private civil law could have been widespread, even though the issue has not yet been thoroughly analysed.O. Sacchi, above, p. 302-303; Salvatore Tondo \\"La semantica di sacramentum nella sfera giudiziale\\" in Studia et Documenta Historiae et iuris 35, 1969 p. 305 and 337; Francesco Sini Documenti sacerdotali di Roma antica I. Libri e commentari Sassari, 1983, p.164; Antonello Calore, Per Iovem lapidem, 2000, p.146; Filippo Cancelli, La giuriprudenza unica dei pontefici, Milano, 1996, p. 36. Even though in the inscription there is no segment directly reminiscent of the dialogic formula of the sponsio, i.e. \\"spondes tu ...?\\", \\"spondeo!\\", internal and external evidence allow the assumption of the enactment of a matrimonial sponsio.Res sacrae were the straight tunica and the yellow network worn by the bride. Festus s. v. spondere, p. 440 L, derives sponsio from Greek œÉœÄŒøŒΩŒ¥Œ¨œÇ, i.e. the sacred libation the bride and bridegroom dedicated to the gods. Such a usage of oaths is attested in later literary sources.Pliny, Naturalis Historia, XXVIII 27; Servius, Ad Georgicas, I 21; Plautus, Cistellaria 98; Ovid, Epodes, XXI 133-144; O. Sacchi, above, p. 304. Besides the trace of a sponsio as the legal function of the object, Dum√©zil would also see that of providing a piece evidence, i.e. a probatory attitude. Servius in his commentary to the Aeneid writes that, before the introduction of the matrimonial tablets, in Latium the parties used to exchange tokens of pledge (symbola) on which they stated as a promise that they agreed to the marriage and nominated guarantors (sponsores). To the same time of the regal period is ascribed the introduction of the Greek use of double scriptures, tesserae.Servius, Aeneis, X 79: Legere furari ... Gremiis abducere pactas id est sponsas: nam ante usum tabularum matrimonii cautiones sibi invicem emittebant, et fideiussores dabant: unde admissum est ut sponsum dicamus virum a spondendo, et sponsam promissam. Ceterum proprie sponderi puallae est: ergo sponsus non quia promittitur, sed quia spondet et sponsores dat. Sane exaggeratio est nimia in quod ait 'gremiis abducere', tamquam iam uxores.: the allusion to the simulated abduction of the girl reflects a practice attested in rural Latium til the time of the social war according to Gellius: cf. Paulus ex Festus s.v. rapi, p. 365 L; Simon and Elboj, above, p. 267; Georges Dum√©zil, Id√©es romaines, p. 23; G. Colonna, above, p. 168, n. 4; O. Sacchi, above, p. 325. The sponsio is one of the most ancient forms of verbal undertaking of obligation and its religious nature is acknowledged, as well as its connection with betrothal.Arangio-Ruiz, Instituciones, p. 446; W. H. Buckler, Obligation in Roman Law, New York, 1893. The ancient sources are in agreement that the archaic sponsalia had a religious nature.F. Fabbrini, Novissimo Digesto Italiano, 15, 1968, p.510, s.v. Res divini iuris for a review; Festus s.v. spondere, p. 440 L. Brent Vine's studyA Note on the Duenos Inscription 1997 which focuses on the linguistic analysis of the word of the first sentence and of the segment of the third lends support to such an interpretation: he argues that mitat would be a form of a frequentative verb mitare based on a past participle in -to of an IE root *me…®ÃØ, with the meaning of 'exchange'. Semantically this frequentative should be considered factitive, thence arriving at a verb that would mean 'to cause to be given in exchange', hence 'to give (in exchange)'. Vine's analysis of the segment fits the hypothesis of an exchange of symbola equally well. He argues that a word could be isolated on the grounds of the single spelling of geminates which is considered normal by linguists for the archaic period. This he proposes to understand as reflecting a substantivised *m√©iÃØ-no-, meaning 'something given in exchange, gift' from the same root *meiÃØ as in . This form would be a -no substantive, a widely attested formation and may be presupposed by Latin m≈´nus, m≈´neris 'duty, service, office, offering', from immediate antecedent *m√≥iÃØ-n-es-. The appearance of mitat and [m]einom show a semantic contiguity and may constitute a figura etymologica. This alliterative form would be analogous to the Old Latin phrase donum do, donum being formed exactly in the same way as supposed for [m]einom (*d√©h3-no-). *Meinom mito would have existed beside donum do, both referring to similar but culturally distinct behaviours, the first one perhaps \\"specifically involving exchange/reciprocity\\". The document raises also the question of the kind of the marriage in question, and specifically of whether it was with or without manus. Dum√©zil supported the thesis of a marriage without loss the independent status of the woman (sine capitis deminutio). In the last case it should be admitted that in archaic times a form of marriage existed in which the sponsio was directly linked to the nuptiae, independently from the initial constitution of the manus. The sponsalia would then be the occasion upon which the legal subjects defined the compacts concerning the juridical and economic aspects of the marriage:Varro, Lingua Latina, VI 70-71; Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, IV 4, 1; Ulpian apud Digesta, XXIII 1, 2: \\"Sponsalia dicta sunt a spondendo: nam moris fuit veteribus stipulari et spondere sibi uxores futuras\\". the dowry, the future legal status of the woman who could be put under the potestas/tutela of one or more persons,Cf. Plautus Curc. 672. the compensations for a passage of status of the woman and the guarantees for breach of promise. Two strata were perhaps present as testified by the expression more atque iure of Gellius. Then the object in question could well have been deposited in a temple upon the occasion of a marriage ritual as a probatory document of an engagement undertaken not by the girl but by her sponsor. The compact would be also a legal guarantee of the rights of the future bridegroom. =The second section= The most relevant issue for the interpretation of the document in Sacchi's view is the meaning the lexical couple . The meaning of Duenos has been often considered to be the name of the craftsman who made the object. Such an interpretation meets with the difficulty of how to explain the second occurrence of the word and with the problem of how to interpret , since if Duenos is a name identifying a person and qualifying him as 'good' then it would be difficult to understand the use of manom in the same sense of 'good'. It should be easier to understand manom as manum ('hand'), i.e. reading: \\"Duenos made me with his own hands\\". Sacchi, following Palmer and Colonna,R. E. A. Palmer above; G. Colonna above. proposes to interpret the couple as conveying a specifically technical religious and legal meaning as is testified in ancient sources. Duenos has given classic Latin bonus, 'good',Paulus ex Festo s. v. Matrem Matutam, p. 109 L; Varro, LL VI 4; Varro, VII 26 \\"Ian cusianes duonus ceruses duonus Ianusve\\": Macrobius, Saturnalia I 3, 13. but originally the adjective had certainly religious and sacral implications: in the oldest sacral formulae it had a more technical acception and the repetition had other implications than just eurythmy. Colonna refers to the formula optumus duonorum of the mid republic which was a qualificative formula with sacral implication reserved to the upper classes. Correspondences are the opposition of the epithets Optimus and Maximus of Capitoline Jupiter, the early Faliscan Titia inscription \\"Eco quton euotenosio titias duenom duenas. Salu[...]voltene\\"To be read as: \\"Eco quto*e votenosio titias duenom duenas salve[...]d voltene\\" according to Bakkum, The Latin Dialect of the Ager Faliscus: 150 Years of Scholarsahip, Amsterdam, 2009, p. 409. interpreted as 'good among the good', the epitaph of Lucius Cornelius Scipio, the consul of 259 BC, duonoro[m] optumo[m]... viro[m] in which clearly the adjective duonus is not the synonym of optumus, that as derived from ops, plenty, has different semantic connotations. Colonna also reminds that \\"in the carmen Saliare (similarly to the Duenos vase) bonus (duonus) and manus occur together, both referred to the same character, the god Cerus, fact that makes their synonymity implausible\\".Cf. Festus s.v. Matrem Matutam: \\"... et in carmine Saliari Cerus manus intelligitur creator bonus\\" p. 109 L; also s. v. mane p. 112 L; Varro Lingua Latina VII 26: \\"ian cusianes duonus ceruses du(o)nus ianusve\\"; Colonna, above, p. 168. In order to further clarify the use of the adjective in the text, Sacchi makes reference also to a well-known passage of Cicero's De Legibus II 9, 22: Deorum Manium iura sancta sunto. (B)onos leto datos divos habento .... Here too as in the above two instances \\"one can remark the opposition between Manium, that, as shown in Paulus exc. Festi, originally meant 'the good ones' and the qualificative (B)onos = Duenos as referred to the deified dead (= divos). Cicero here relates a pontifical prescription of high antiquity consciously preserving the original wise of expression and lexic\\".Cicero De Legibus II 7, 18. In other words, one could argue that it is not meant that the dii Manes become 'good' in the ethic sense, but rather that the dead consecrated to death according to the pontifical prescriptions (leto datos) do become gods (= divos).O. Sacchi, above, p. 333; also citing Georges Dum√©zil, Id√©es romaines, pp. 24-25: dueno- from d√∫vas 'cult, offering to a god', \\"later bonus used alone shall take up all other values\\"; A. Ernout and A. Meillet, Dictionnaire √©tymologique de la langue latine, Paris, 1967, p. 73: \\"*dwenos from root *du-, technical religious term, Sanskrit d√∫vah = 'hommage' ... in Latin religious language di boni\\" The epithet duenos would then design that which has been given in homage, consecrated correctly according to the pontifical ritual. Sacchi opines that in the case of the Duenos inscription the speaker is acting according to the religious legal ritual, presumably enacting a private consecratio: the formula of the dedication is then a case of private dedicatio dis, dedication to the gods. The epithet duenos should therefore be interpreted as used in its original technical sense. The restitution of the text should thus be: \\"A party acting in the way sanctioned by religious law made/consecrated me for a good end. That no harm/fraud be done to me and to one who is a party (equally) religiously sanctioned by the gods\\".A better rendering might be: \\"... that no harm/fraud be done through me to one who is a party sanctioned by the gods\\". The vase is a speaking token that after the celebration of the ritual consecrates the content of the action, of which it is \\"the form in its probatory function and the matter as a constituent element\\".Taking into account Brent Vine's hypothesis about the interpretation of [m]einom as munus though the rendering of the text should be somewhat altered and interpreted as: \\"A (as above) made me as a good (legal etc.) gift/offering/token, that no evil/harm be done through me to a \\" or \\"that no evil party lay me to a \\". Vine quotes German authors who still follow the erotic thread of interpretation. They think of the vase as a container for beauty products and interpret the last phrase as 'let no evil person steal me'. \\" would be a form of a Latin verb *stare that failed to survive for its homonymie f√¢cheuse [unfortunate homonymy] with the ordinary verb for 'stand, as found in Hittite tƒÅyezzi 'steals', Vedic sten√°-stƒÅy√∫ 'thief'.H. Rix, \\"Das letzte Wort der Duenos-Inschrif\\", MSS, 46, 1985, pp. 193 ff.; H. Eichner, \\"Reklameniamben aus Roms K√∂nigszeit\\", Die Sprache, 34, 1988-90, p. 216. Both Sacchi and Vine remark the striking parallelism between the formula of the Duenos inscription: and the inscription on a pedestal (probably of a votive statue) from Tibur: .R. Wachter, Altlateinische Inschriften, Bern / Frankfurt am Mein / New York / Paris, 1987; M. Cristofani (ed.), La Grande Roma dei Tarquini (Catalogue of the Exhibition, Roma, 12 June to 30 September 1990), Rome: L'Erma di Bretscheider, 1990, , p. 24. Vine finds in it support for his interpreting of as meaning munus. =Cosmis= Sacchi rejects the interpretation of cosmis as agreeable in the first section that is traditionally accepted in the scholarly literature, on the grounds of considerations of history of the language and semantics. He proposes to interpret the term as referring to the peculiar style of hairdressing of brides, known as seni crines which would find support in Festus:Festus s.v. Comptus, p. 55 L. \\"Comptus id est ornatus ... qui apud nos comis: et comae dicuntur capilli cum aliqua cura compositi\\", 'Comptus, that is adorned, ... what we call comis; and comae is named the hair dressed with a certain care'. In the inscription the use of this word would be an explicit allusion to the fact that the girl shall be ready to marry. Festus gives it as a most ancient custom for marriage ceremonies.Festus s. v. Senis crinibus, p. 454 L: \\"Senis crinibus nubentes ornantur, quod [h]is ornatus vestustissimus fuit\\". An analogous usage of the word comis is to be found in Gellius while relating the custom of flaminica dialis on the occasion of the Argei.Aulus Gellius, Noct. Att., X 15, 30: \\"... cum it ad Argeos, quod neque comit caput neque capillum depictit\\".

It also focuses on ensuring the reinstatement of those whose lives are impacted by crimes. In modern times the idea of making living spaces safe and clean has spread from the civilian population to include prisons, on ethical grounds which honor that unsafe and unsanitary prisons violate constitutional (law) prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment. In recent times prison reform ideas include greater access to legal counsel and family, conjugal visits, proactive security against violence, and implementing house arrest with assistive technology. History Prison populations of various countries in 2008 Prisons have only been used as the primary punishment for criminal acts in the last few centuries. Far more common earlier were various types of corporal punishment, public humiliation, penal bondage, and banishment for more severe offenses, as well as capital punishment. All of which occur today. The concept of incarceration was presented circa 1750 as a more humane form of punishment than the aforementioned corporal and capital punishment. They originally were designed as a way for criminals to participate in religious self-reflection and self-reform as a form of penance, hence the term penitentiary.Davis, Angela Y. \\"Imprisonment and Reform\\" Dimensions of Culture 2: Justice, edited by Dr. Amanda Solomon, Dr. Megan Strom, and Dr. Emily Johnson, Cognella, 2019, pp. 95-102. Prisons contained both felons and debtors ‚Äì the latter of which were allowed to bring in wives and children. The jailer made his money by charging the inmates for food and drink and legal services and the whole system was rife with corruption. One reform of the sixteenth century had been the establishment of the London Bridewell as a house of correction for women and children. This was the only place any medical services were provided. =United Kingdom= 18th century During the eighteenth century, British justice used a wide variety of measures to punish crime, including fines, the pillory and whipping. Transportation to The United States of America was often offered, until 1776, as an alternative to the death penalty, which could be imposed for many offenses including pilfering. When they ran out of prisons in 1776 they used old sailing vessels which came to be called hulks as places of temporary confinement. The most notable reformer was John Howard who, having visited several hundred prisons across England and Europe, beginning when he was high sheriff of Bedfordshire, published The State of the Prisons in 1777. He was particularly appalled to discover prisoners who had been acquitted but were still confined because they couldn't pay the jailer's fees. He proposed that each prisoner should be in a separate cell with separate sections for women felons, men felons, young offenders and debtors. The prison reform charity, the Howard League for Penal Reform, takes its name from John Howard. The Penitentiary Act which passed in 1779 following his agitation introduced solitary confinement, religious instruction and a labor regime and proposed two state penitentiaries, one for men and one for women. These were never built due to disagreements in the committee and pressures from wars with France and jails remained a local responsibility. But other measures passed in the next few years provided magistrates with the powers to implement many of these reforms and eventually in 1815 jail fees were abolished. Quakers such as Elizabeth Fry continued to publicize the dire state of prisons as did Charles Dickens in his novels David Copperfield and Little Dorrit about the Marshalsea. Samuel Romilly managed to repeal the death penalty for theft in 1806, but repealing it for other similar offences brought in a political element that had previously been absent. The Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, founded in 1816, supported both the Panopticon for the design of prisons and the use of the treadwheel as a means of hard labor. By 1824, 54 prisons had adopted this means of discipline. Robert Peel's Gaols Act of 1823 attempted to impose uniformity in the country but local prisons remained under the control of magistrates until the Prison Act of 1877. 19th century The American separate system attracted the attention of some reformers and led to the creation of Millbank Prison in 1816 and Pentonville prison in 1842. By now the end of transportation to Australia and the use of hulks was in sight and Joshua Jebb set an ambitious program of prison building with one large prison opening per year. The main principles were separation and hard labour for serious crimes, using treadwheels and cranks. However, by the 1860s public opinion was calling for harsher measures in reaction to an increase in crime which was perceived to come from the 'flood of criminals' released under the penal servitude system. The reaction from the committee set up under the commissioner of prisons, Colonel Edmund Frederick du Cane, was to increase minimum sentences for many offences with deterrent principles of 'hard labour, hard fare, and a hard bed'. In 1877 he encouraged Disraeli's government to remove all prisons from local government and held a firm grip on the prison system till his forced retirement in 1895. He also established a tradition of secrecy which lasted till the 1970s so that even magistrates and investigators were unable to see the insides of prisons. By the 1890s the prison population was over 20,000.  1877-1914  The British penal system underwent a transition from harsh punishment to reform, education, and training for post-prison livelihoods. The reforms were controversial and contested. In 1877-1914 era a series of major legislative reforms enabled significant improvement in the penal system. In 1877, the previously localized prisons were nationalized in the Home Office under a Prison Commission. The Prison Act of 1898 enabled the Home Secretary to and multiple reforms on his own initiative, without going through the politicized process of Parliament. The Probation of Offenders Act of 1907 introduced a new probation system that drastically cut down the prison population, while providing a mechanism for transition back to normal life. The Criminal Justice Administration Act of 1914 required courts to allow a reasonable time before imprisonment was ordered for people who did not pay their fines. Previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced solely for that reason. The Borstal system after 1908 was organized to reclaim young offenders, and the Children Act of 1908 prohibited imprisonment under age 14, and strictly limited that of ages 14 to 16. The principal reformer was Sir Evelyn Ruggles- Brise. the chair of the Prison Commission.R.C.K. Ensor. ‚Äò‚Äô England 1870-1914‚Äô‚Äô (1937) pp 520-21.J.W. Fox, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Modern English Prison ‚Äò‚Äô (1934). =Winston Churchill= Major reforms were championed by The Liberal Party government in 1906‚Äì14. The key player was Winston Churchill when he was the Liberal Home Secretary, 1910‚Äì11.Jamie Bennett, \\"The Man, the Machine and the Myths: Reconsidering Winston Churchill‚Äôs Prison Reforms.\\" in Helen Johnston, ed., Punishment and Control in Historical Perspective (2008) pp. 95-114. online He first achieved fame as a prisoner in the Boer war in 1899. He escaped after 28 days and the media, and his own book, made him a national hero overnight.Candice Millard, Hero of the Empire: The Boer War, a Daring Escape, and the Making of Winston Churchill (2016) He later wrote, \\"I certainly hated my captivity more then I have ever hated any other in my whole life....Looking back on those days I've always felt the keenest pity for prisoners and captives.\\" As Home Secretary he was in charge of the nation's penal system. Biographer Paul Addison says. \\"More than any other Home Secretary of the 20th century, Churchill was the prisoner's friend. He arrived at the Home Office with the firm conviction that the penal system was excessively harsh.‚Äù He worked to reduce the number sent to prison in the first place, shorten their terms, and make life in prison more tolerable, and rehabilitation more likely.Addison, p. 51. His reforms were not politically popular, but they had a major long-term impact on the British penal system.Edward Moritz, Jr., \\"Winston Churchill - Prison Reformer,\\" The Historian 20#4 (1958), pp. 428-440 onlineVictor Bailey, \\"Churchill As Home-Secretary--Prison Reform.\\" History Today vol 35 (March 1985): 10-13. =Borstal system= In 1894-5 Herbert Gladstone's Committee on Prisons showed that criminal propensity peaked from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties. He took the view that central government should break the cycle of offending and imprisonment by establishing a new type of reformatory, that was called Borstal after the village in Kent which housed the first one. The movement reached its peak after the first world war when Alexander Paterson became commissioner, delegating authority and encouraging personal responsibility in the fashion of the English Public school: cellblocks were designated as 'houses' by name and had a housemaster. Cross-country walks were encouraged, and no one ran away. Prison populations remained at a low level until after the second world war when Paterson died and the movement was unable to update itself. Some aspects of Borstal found their way into the main prison system, including open prisons and housemasters, renamed assistant governors and many Borstal-trained prison officers used their experience in the wider service. But in general the prison system in the twentieth century remained in Victorian buildings which steadily became more and more overcrowded with inevitable results. =United States= In colonial America, punishments were severe. The Massachusetts assembly in 1736 ordered that a thief, on first conviction, be fined or whipped. The second time he was to pay treble damages, sit for an hour upon the gallows platform with a noose around his neck and then be carted to the whipping post for thirty stripes. For the third offense he was to be hanged. But the implementation was haphazard as there was no effective police system and judges wouldn't convict if they believed the punishment was excessive. The local jails mainly held men awaiting trial or punishment and those in debt. In the aftermath of independence most states amended their criminal punishment statutes. Pennsylvania eliminated the death penalty for robbery and burglary in 1786, and in 1794 retained it only for first degree murder. Other states followed and in all cases the answer to what alternative penalties should be imposed was incarceration. Pennsylvania turned its old jail at Walnut Street into a state prison. New York built Newgate state prison in Greenwich Village and other states followed. But by 1820 faith in the efficacy of legal reform had declined as statutory changes had no discernible effect on the level of crime and the prisons, where prisoners shared large rooms and booty including alcohol, had become riotous and prone to escapes. In response, New York developed the Auburn system in which prisoners were confined in separate cells and prohibited from talking when eating and working together, implementing it at Auburn State Prison and Sing Sing at Ossining. The aim of this was rehabilitative: the reformers talked about the penitentiary serving as a model for the family and the school and almost all the states adopted the plan (though Pennsylvania went even further in separating prisoners). The system's fame spread and visitors to the U.S. to see the prisons included de Tocqueville who wrote Democracy in America as a result of his visit. However, by the 1860s, overcrowding became the rule of the day, partly because of the long sentences given for violent crimes, despite increasing severity inside the prison and often cruel methods of gagging and restraining prisoners. An increasing proportion of prisoners were new immigrants. As a result of a tour of prisons in 18 states, Enoch Wines and Theodore Dwight produced a monumental report describing the flaws in the existing system and proposing remedies. Their critical finding was that not one of the state prisons in the United States was seeking the reformation of its inmates as a primary goal. They set out an agenda for reform which was endorsed by a National Congress in Cincinnati in 1870. These ideas were put into practice in the Elmira Reformatory in New York in 1876 run by Zebulon Brockway. At the core of the design was an educational program which included general subjects and vocational training for the less capable. Instead of fixed sentences, prisoners who did well could be released early. But by the 1890s, Elmira had twice as many inmates as it was designed for and they were not only the first offenders between 16 and 31 for which the program was intended. Although it had a number of imitators in different states, it did little to halt the deterioration of the country's prisons which carried on a dreary life of their own. In the southern states, in which blacks made up more than 75% of the inmates, there was ruthless exploitation in which the states leased prisoners as chain gangs to entrepreneurs who treated them worse than slaves. By the 1920s drug use in prisons was also becoming a problem. At the beginning of the twentieth century, psychiatric interpretations of social deviance were gaining a central role in criminology and policy making. By 1926, 67 prisons employed psychiatrists and 45 had psychologists. The language of medicine was applied in an attempt to \\"cure\\" offenders of their criminality. In fact, little was known about the causes of their behaviour and prescriptions were not much different from the earlier reform methods. A system of probation was introduced, but often used simply as an alternative to suspended sentences, and the probation officers appointed had little training, and their caseloads numbered several hundred making assistance or surveillance practically impossible. At the same time they could revoke the probation status without going through another trial or other proper process. In 1913, Thomas Mott Osborne became chairman of a commission for the reform of the New York prison system and introduced a Mutual Welfare League at Auburn with a committee of 49 prisoners appointed by secret ballot from the 1400 inmates. He also removed the striped dress uniform at Sing Sing and introduced recreation and movies. Progressive reform resulted in the \\"Big House\\" by the late twenties ‚Äì prisons averaging 2,500 men with professional management designed to eliminate the abusive forms of corporal punishment and prison labor prevailing at the time. The American prison system was shaken by a series of riots in the early 1950s triggered by deficiencies of prison facilities, lack of hygiene or medical care, poor food quality, and guard brutality. In the next decade all these demands were recognized as rights by the courts. In 1954, the American Prison Association changed its name to the American Correctional Association and the rehabilitative emphasis was formalized in the 1955 United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. Since the 1960s the prison population in the US has risen steadily, even during periods where the crime rate has fallen. This is partly due to profound changes in sentencing practices due to a denunciation of lenient policies in the late sixties and early seventies and assertions that rehabilitative purposes do not work. As a consequence sentencing commissions started to establish minimum as well as maximum sentencing guidelines, which have reduced the discretion of parole authorities and also reduced parole supervision of released prisoners. Another factor that contributed to the increase of incarcerations was the Reagan administration's \\"War On Drugs\\" in the 1980s. This War increased money spent on lowering the number of illegal drugs in the United States. As a result, drug arrests increased and prisons became increasingly more crowded. The rising prison population was made up disproportionately of African American with 90% of those sentenced to prison for drug offense in Illinois in 2002.Alexander, Michelle. \\"The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness.\\" Dimensions of Culture 2: Justice, Edited by Dr. Amanda Solomon, Dr. Megan Strom, and Dr. Emily Johnston, Cognella, 2019, pp. 89-94. By 2010, the United States had more prisoners than any other country and a greater percentage of its population was in prison than in any other country in the world. \\"Mass incarceration\\" became a serious social and economic problem, as each of the 2.3 million American prisoners costs an average of about $25,000 per year. Recidivism remained high, and useful programs were often cut during the recession of 2009‚Äì2010. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court in Brown v. Plata upheld the release of thousands of California prisoners due to California's inability to provide constitutionally mandated levels of healthcare. In 2015 a bipartisan effort was launched by Koch family foundations, the ACLU, the Center for American Progress, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the Coalition for Public Safety, and the MacArthur Foundation to more seriously address criminal justice reform in the United States. The Kochs and their partners are combatting the systemic overcriminalization and overincarceration of citizens from primarily low- income and minority communities. The group of reformers is working to reduce recidivism rates and diminish barriers faced by rehabilitated persons seeking new employment in the work force. In addition they have a goal in ending Asset forfeiture practices since law enforcement often deprives individuals of the majority of their private property. Decarceration in the United States includes overlapping reformist and abolitionist strategies, from \\"front door\\" options such as sentencing reform, decriminalization, diversion and mental health treatment to \\"back door\\" approaches, exemplified by parole reform and early release into community supervision programs, amnesty for inmates convicted of non-violent offenses and imposition of prison capacity limits. While reforms focus on incremental changes, abolitionist approaches include budget reallocations, prison closures and restorative and transformative justice programs that challenge incarceration as an effective deterrent and necessary means of incapacitation. Abolitionists support investments in familial and community mental health, affordable housing and quality education to gradually transition and jail employees to jobs in other economic sectors. = Europe = The first public prison in Europe was Le Stinche in Florence, constructed in 1297, copied in several other cities. The more modern use grew from the prison workhouse (known as the Rasphuis) from 1600 in Holland. The house was normally managed by a married couple, the 'father' and 'mother', usually with a work master and discipline master. The inmates, or journeymen, often spent their time on spinning, weaving and fabricating cloths and their output was measured and those who exceeded the minimum received a small sum of money with which they could buy extras from the indoor father. An exception to the rule of forced labor were those inmates whose families could not look after them and paid for them to be in the workhouse. From the later 17th century private institutions for the insane, called the beterhuis, developed to meet this need. In Hamburg a different pattern occurred with the spinhaus in 1669, to which only infamous criminals were admitted. This was paid by the public treasury and the pattern spread in eighteenth-century Germany. In France the use of galley servitude was most common until galleys were abolished in 1748. After this the condemned were put to work in naval arsenals doing heavy work. Confinement originated from the h√¥pitaux g√©n√©raux which were mostly asylums, though in Paris they included many convicts, and persisted up till the revolution. The use of capital punishment and judicial torture declined during the eighteenth century and imprisonment came to dominate the system, although reform movements started almost immediately. Many countries were committed to the goal as a financially self-sustaining institution and the organization was often subcontracted to entrepreneurs, though this created its own tensions and abuse. By the mid nineteenth century several countries initiated experiments in allowing the prisoners to choose the trades in which they were to be apprenticed. The growing amount of recidivism in the latter half of the nineteenth century led a number of criminologists to argue that \\"imprisonment did not, and could not fulfill its original ideal of treatment aimed at reintegrating the offender into the community\\". Belgium led the way in introducing the suspended sentence for first-time offenders in 1888, followed by France in 1891 and most other countries in the next few years. Parole had been introduced on an experimental basis in France in the 1830s, with laws for juveniles introduced in 1850, and Portugal began to use it for adult criminals from 1861. The parole system introduced in France in 1885 made use of a strong private patronage network. Parole was approved throughout Europe at the International Prison Congress of 1910. As a result of these reforms the prison populations of many European countries halved in the first half of the twentieth century. Exceptions to this trend included France and Italy between the world wars, when there was a huge increase in the use of imprisonment. The National Socialist state in Germany used it as an important tool to rid itself of its enemies as crime rates rocketed as a consequence of new categories of criminal behavior. Russia, which had only started to reform its penal and judicial system in 1860 by abolishing corporal punishment, continued the use of exile with hard labor as a punishment and this was increased to a new level of brutality under Joseph Stalin, despite early reforms by the Bolsheviks. Postwar reforms stressed the need for the state to tailor punishment to the individual convicted criminal. In 1965, Sweden enacted a new criminal code emphasizing non-institutional alternatives to punishment including conditional sentences, probation for first-time offenders and the more extensive use of fines. The use of probation caused a dramatic decline in the number women serving long-term sentences: in France the number fell from 5,231 in 1946 to 1,121 in 1980. Probation spread to most European countries though the level of surveillance varies. In the Netherlands, religious and philanthropic groups are responsible for much of the probationary care. The Dutch government invests heavily in correctional personnel, having 3,100 for 4,500 prisoners in 1959. However, despite these reforms, numbers in prison started to grow again after the 1960s even in countries committed to non-custodial policies. Theories of Incarceration and Reform =Retribution, vengeance and retaliation= This is founded on the \\"eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth\\" incarceration philosophy, which essentially states that if one person harms another, then equivalent harm should be done to them. One goal here is to prevent vigilantism, gang or clan warfare, and other actions by those who have an unsatisfied need to \\"get even\\" for a crime against them, their family, or their group. It is, however, difficult to determine how to equate different types of \\"harm\\". A literal case is where a murderer is punished with the death penalty, the argument being \\"justice demands a life for a life\\". One criticism of long term prison sentences and other methods for achieving justice is that such \\"warehousing\\" of criminals is rather expensive, this argument notwithstanding the fact that the multiple incarceration appeals of a death penalty case often exceed the price of the \\"warehousing\\" of the criminal in question. Yet another facet of this debate disregards the financial cost for the most part. The argument regarding warehousing rests, in this case, upon the theory that any punishment considered respectful of human rights should not include imprisoning humans for life without a chance of release‚Äîthat even death is morally and ethically a higher road than no-parole prison sentences. =Deterrence= The criminal is used as a \\"threat to themselves and others\\". By subjecting prisoners to harsh conditions, authorities hope to convince them to avoid future criminal behavior and to exemplify for others the rewards for avoiding such behavior; that is, the fear of punishment will win over whatever benefit or pleasure the illegal activity might bring. The deterrence model frequently goes far beyond \\"an eye for an eye\\", exacting a more severe punishment than would seem to be indicated by the crime. Torture has been used in the past as a deterrent, as has the public embarrassment and discomfort of stocks, and, in religious communities, ex-communication. Executions, particularly gruesome ones (such as hanging or beheading), often for petty offenses, are further examples of attempts at deterrence. One criticism of the deterrence model is that criminals typically have a rather short-term orientation, and the possibility of long-term consequences is of little importance to them. Also, their quality of life may be so horrific that any treatment within the criminal justice system (which is compatible with human rights law) will only be seen as an improvement over their previous situation. There used to be many European Monks who disagreed with the containment of the mentally ill, and their ethics had a strong influence on Dorothea Dix's mission to find a proper way to care for the challenged people. =Rehabilitation, reform and correction= (\\"Reform\\" here refers to reform of the individual, not the reform of the penal system.) The goal is to \\"repair\\" the deficiencies in the individual and return them as productive members of society. Education, work skills, deferred gratification, treating others with respect, and self-discipline are stressed. Younger criminals who have committed fewer and less severe crimes are most likely to be successfully reformed. \\"Reform schools\\" and \\"boot camps\\" are set up according to this model. One criticism of this model is that criminals are rewarded with training and other items which would not have been available to them had they not committed a crime. Prior to its closing in late 1969, Eastern State Penitentiary, then known as State Correctional Institution, Philadelphia, had established a far reaching program of voluntary group therapy with the goal of having all inmates in the prison involved. From 1967 when the plan was initiated, the program appears to have been successful as many inmates did volunteer for group therapy. An interesting aspect was that the groups were to be led by two therapists, one from the psychology or social work department and a second from one of the officers among the prison guard staff. =Removal from society= The goal here is simply to keep criminals away from potential victims, thus reducing the number of crimes they can commit. The criticism of this model is that others increase the number and severity of crimes they commit to make up for the \\"vacuum\\" left by the removed criminal. For example, incarcerating a drug dealer will result in an unmet demand for drugs at that locale, and an existing or new drug dealer will then appear, to fill the void. This new drug dealer may have been innocent of any crimes before this opportunity, or may have been guilty of less serious crimes, such as being a look-out for the previous drug dealer. =Restitution or repayment= Prisoners are forced to repay their \\"debt\\" to society. Unpaid or low pay work is common in many prisons, often to the benefit of the community. In some countries prisons operate as labour camps. Critics say that the repayment model gives government an economic incentive to send more people to prison. In corrupt or authoritarian regimes, such as the former Soviet Union under the control of Joseph Stalin, many citizens are sentenced to forced labour for minor breaches of the law, simply because the government requires the labour camps as a source of income. Community service is increasingly being used as an alternative to prison for petty criminals. =Reduction in immediate costs= Government and prison officials also have the goal of minimizing short-term costs; however, there could be a way for prisons to become self-sustaining independent institutions‚Äîwith little need for government funds. :In wealthy societies: :This calls for keeping prisoners placated by providing them with things like television and conjugal visits. Inexpensive measures like these prevent prison assaults and riots which in turn allow the number of guards to be minimized. Providing the quickest possible parole and/or release also reduces immediate costs to the prison system (although these may very well increase long term costs to the prison system and society due to recidivism). The ultimate way to reduce immediate costs is to eliminate prisons entirely and use fines, community service, and other sanctions (like the loss of a driver's license or the right to vote) instead. Executions at first would appear to limit costs, but, in most wealthy societies, the long appeals process for death sentences (and associated legal costs) make them quite expensive. Note that this goal may conflict with a number of goals for criminal justice systems. :In poor societies: :Poor societies, which lack the resources to imprison criminals for years, frequently use execution in place of imprisonment, for severe crimes. Less severe crimes, such as theft, might be dealt with by less severe physical means, such as amputation of the hands. When long term imprisonment is used in such societies, it may be a virtual death sentence, as the lack of food, sanitation, and medical care causes widespread disease and death, in such prisons. Some of the goals of criminal justice are compatible with one another, while others are in conflict. In the history of prison reform, the harsh treatment, torture, and executions used for deterrence first came under fire as a violation of human rights. The salvation goal, and methods, were later attacked as violations of the individual's freedom of religion. This led to further reforms aimed principally at reform/correction of the individual, removal from society, and reduction of immediate costs. The perception that such reforms sometimes denied victims justice then led to further changes. Advocacy Work John Howard is now widely regarded as the founding father of prison reform, having travelled extensively visiting prisons across Europe in the 1770s and 1780s. Also, the great social reformer Jonas Hanway promoted \\"solitude in imprisonment, with proper no one asked profitable labor and a spare diet\\".Hanway, Jonas (1776) Solitude in Imprisonment: With Proper Profitable Labour and a Spare Diet, the Most Humane and... J. Bew. Retrieved 2006-10-30 Indeed, this became the popular model in England for many decades. =United Kingdom= Within Britain, prison reform was spearheaded by the Quakers, and in particular, Elizabeth Fry during the Victorian Age. Elizabeth Fry visited prisons and suggested basic human rights for prisoners, such as privacy and teaching prisoners a trade. Fry was particularly concerned with women's rights. Parliament, coming to realize that a significant portion of prisoners had come to commit crimes as a result of mental illness, passed the County Asylums Act (1808). This made it possible for Justice of the Peace in each county to build and run their own pauper asylums. \\"Whereas the practice of confining such lunatics and other insane persons as are chargeable to their respective parishes in Gaols, Houses of Correction, Poor Houses and Houses of Industry, is highly dangerous and inconvenient\\" There is contemporary research on the use of volunteers by governments to help ensure the fair and humane detention of prisoners. Research suggests that volunteers can be effective to ensure oversight of state functions and ensure accountability, however, they must be given tasks appropriately and well trained. =United States= Johnny Cash advocated prison reform at his July 1972 meeting with United States President Richard Nixon. Kim Kardashian and President Donald Trump discuss prison reform in May 2018. In the 1800s, Dorothea Dix toured prisons in the U.S. and all over Europe looking at the conditions of the mentally handicapped. Her ideas led to a mushroom effect of asylums all over the United States in the mid-19th-century. Linda Gilbert established 22 prison libraries of from 1,500 to 2,000 volumes each, in six states. In the early 1900s Samuel June Barrows was a leader in prison reform. President Cleveland appointed him International Prison Commissioner for the U.S. in 1895, and in 1900 Barrows became Secretary of the Prison Association of New York and held that position until his death on April 21, 1909. A Unitarian pastor, Barrows used his influence as editor of the Unitarian Christian Register to speak at meetings of the National Conference of Charities and Correction, the National International Prison Congresses, and the Society for International Law. As the International Prison Commissioner for the U.S., he wrote several of today's most valuable documents of American penological literature, including \\"Children's Courts in the United States\\" and \\"The Criminal Insane in the United States and in Foreign Countries\\". As a House representative, Barrows was pivotal in the creation of the International Prison Congress and became its president in 1905. In his final role, as Secretary of the Prison Association of New York, he dissolved the association's debt, began issuing annual reports, drafted and ensured passage of New York's first probation law, assisted in the implementation of a federal Parole Law, and promoted civil service for prison employees. Moreover, Barrows advocated improved prison structures and methods, traveling in 1907 around the world to bring back detailed plans of 36 of the best prisons in 14 different countries. In 1910 the National League of Volunteer Workers, nicknamed the \\"Barrows League\\" in his memory, formed in New York as a group dedicated to helping released prisoners and petitioning for better prison conditions. Zebulon Brockway in Fifty Years of Prison Service outlined an ideal prison system: Prisoners should support themselves in prison though industry, in anticipation of supporting themselves outside prison; outside businesses and labor must not interfere; indeterminate sentences were required, making prisoners earn their release with constructive behavior, not just the passage of time; and education and a Christian culture should be imparted. Nevertheless, opposition to prison industries, the prison-industrial complex, and labor increased. Finally, U.S. law prohibited the transport of prison-made goods across state lines. Most prison-made goods today are only for government use‚Äîbut the state and federal governments are not required to meet their needs from prison industries. Although nearly every prison reformer in history believed prisoners should work usefully, and several prisons in the 1800s were profitable and self-supporting, most American prisoners today do not have productive jobs in prison.One in 100: Behind Bars in America, 2008, Pew Center's Public Safety Performance Project @ pewcenteronthestates; Stephen Garvey, \\"Freeing Prisoners' Labor,\\" 50 Stanford Law Review 339, 343 (1‚Äì1998); John Dewar Gleissner, Prison & Slavery ‚Äì A Surprising Comparison, Outskirts Press, 2010. Kim Kardashian-West has fought for prison reform, notably visiting the White House to visit President Donald Trump in on May 30, 2018. In 2018, Trump announced he was providing clemency to Alice Johnson, a week after the meeting with Kardashian-West. Johnson was given a life sentence for drug charges. She has also helped with lobbying the First Step Act, reducing the federally mandated minimum prison sentences. Rappers Jay-Z and Meek Mill have also been advocates for prison reform, both being very outspoken about the issue. In 2019, they announced the launching of organization REFORM Alliance, who aims to reduce the number of people who are serving probation and parole sentences that are unjust. The organization was able to pledge $50 million to debut, also deciding to bring on CNN news commentator Van Jones as CEO. Musician Johnny Cash performed and recorded at many prisons and fought for prison reform. His song \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", tells the tale from the perspective of a convicted killer in prison. Named after Folsom State Prison, which is California's second oldest correctional facility. Only twelve years later, after the song was released Cash performed the song live at the prison. Not all prison reformers approach the problem from the left side of the political spectrum, although most do. In \\"How to Create American Manufacturing Jobs,\\" it was proposed that restrictions on prison industries and labor and federal employment laws be eliminated so that prisoners and private employers could negotiate wage agreements to make goods now made exclusively overseas.John Dewar Gleissner, How to Create American Manufacturing Jobs, Vol. 9, Tennessee Journal of Law and Policy, Issue 3 (2013) @ https://trace.tennessee.edu/tjlp/vol9/iss3/4 This would boost prison wages and revitalize prison industries away from the money-losing state industries approach that now limits prison labor and industries. Prisoners want to work, but there are not enough jobs in prison for them to be productive. On December 21, 2018, President Donald Trump signed the First Step Act bill into law. The First Step Act has provisions to ease prison sentences for drug related crimes, and promote good behavior in federal prisons.

Foo drowned while surfing at Mavericks, Half Moon Bay, California, in 1994. Early life Mark Foo was born in Singapore on February 5, 1958, to Colonel Charlie and Lorna Foo, Chinese photojournalists for the U.S. Information Agency. The family relocated to Hawaii when Foo was 10. He spent his early childhood surfing the South Shore of O'ahu, and continued surfing throughout his teenage years. His family moved several times during his adolescence but ultimately returned to Hawaii just before Foo finished high school. He studied for two years at the University of Hawaii. Career In 1977, Foo joined the IPS World Tour, a professional surfing tour. In the early 1980s, Foo quit the IPS World Tour and stopped competing. Foo's passion for surfing big waves led him to surf larger and larger swells. In 1983, he surfed Waimea Bay, a famous big-wave surfing spot on the North Shore of O'ahu, for the first time. But it was on January 18, 1986, when he ventured out into the bay with waves that onlookers said were in excess of 60 feet, that he rose to fame. When Foo fell off the overhanging ledge, the crashing wave broke his surfboard and tossed him into the water. Foo had to be rescued by a nearby helicopter, yet he emerged from the crash unharmed. He sent the story to various surfing magazines, and the failed attempt raised his surfing to status to that of a \\"demigod.\\" Death at Mavericks Memorial to Mark Foo at Mavericks Point on the Northern California CoastOn December 23, 1994, Foo died in a surfing accident at Mavericks, a big- wave surf location in Half Moon Bay, Northern California. Surfer magazine wrote that Foo was sleep-deprived after arriving in California on an overnight flight for the swell. During takeoff on a wave estimated at 18‚Äì20 feet (Hawaiian scale), Foo experienced a seemingly innocuous wipeout and drowned. The fateful wipeout was photographed from at least two angles, and shows him falling forward near the bottom of the wave. The most popular presumption is that Foo's surf leash had become entangled on the rocks, with the rushing currents of a second wave passing overhead preventing him from disengaging his ankle strap and getting to the surface. This theory was further validated when professional surfer Mike Parsons, who wiped out on the following wave, said that he came into contact with something, possibly Foo, as he was tumbled around underwater. Foo's body was discovered still tied to the broken tail section of his board inside Pillar Point lagoon over two hours later. The coroner's report cited \\"salt-water drowning\\" and \\"blunt head trauma\\" as his causes of death. Foo's death shook the big-wave surfing community. On December 30, over 700 people arrived at Waimea Bay for his funeral. Approximately 150 surfers paddled into and formed a large circle. One of the participants, who was carrying a container with Foo's ashes, paddled into the center of the circle and placed the ashes into the ocean. A segment of the film Riding Giants documented Foo's death at Mavericks. Legacy Foo helped elevate the popularity of the sport, with his talent, courage, and enthusiasm, and was recognized as one of the greatest big-wave surfers of all time. Mark was a favorite subject of photographers, and he had his own cable television surfing program. \\"If you want to ride the ultimate wave, you have to be willing to pay the ultimate price\\" was Foo's philosophy. In the realm of big-wave surfing, Foo's death brought about a continuing discourse regarding the safe use of surfboard leashes, or flexible cords that connect the surfboard to a belt on the surfers ankle. Proponents defend the leash as a useful convenience and insurance against losing the surfboard, which serves as flotation device in the case of a \\"wipe out.\\" They also assert that the leash is a means for a fallen surfer to find his way to surface air by following the leash cord to the floating surfboard on the water's surface. There are also surfers who believe that Foo's surfboard leash may have caused or contributed to his death. Opponents of leashes in big surf assert that a leash can cause the surfer to collide with the board in a wipe out, potentially causing head injuries, and that the leash can also loop around the arms, legs, or neck, dangerously restricting escape to safety or strangling the surfer. Quick- release Velcro leashes have since become standard surfing equipment to address some of these dangers. The debates continue to this day. American rock band Seventeen (later known as Lustra) performed a musical tribute (misspelled as \\"Mark Fu\\") on their 2000 LP Bikini Pie Fight!.

Early life Clarke was born in Waterdown, Ontario. He spent his early years in England, home of his parents, but later returned and settled in Winnipeg, Manitoba in about 1903. When World War I started, he was working as a surveyor for the Canadian Northern Railway in the Canadian north. He returned to Winnipeg to enlist in the 27th Battalion, and after arriving in England in June 1915, transferred to the 2nd (Eastern Ontario Regiment) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force to be with his brother, Charles. Victoria Cross The main assault of the Battle of Flers- Courcelette was scheduled for September 15, 1916. Its objective was to occupy a chain of trenches between Martinpuich and Courcelette. On 1 September 1916, Clarke's battalion was charged with capturing a 50-yard-long salient between the Canadian position at Mouquet Farm and Courcelette to the north. On 9 September 1916, near Pozi√®res, France, the first three companies of Clarke's battalion went over the top, leaving the fourth in reserve. Clarke, an Acting Corporal at the time, was assigned to take a section to clear the enemy on the left flank to allow his company sergeant to build a fortified dugout that would secure the Canadian position once the salient was overrun. When his section reached the trench, it was so heavily defended that they had to battle their way through with hand grenades, bayonets and their rifles as clubs. Clarke was the only man left standing; the rest had either been killed or wounded. At that time, about 20 Germans, including two officers, counter- attacked. Clarke advanced, emptying his revolver into their ranks. He then picked up two enemy rifles and fired those too. One of the officers attacked with a bayonet, wounding Clarke in the leg, but Clarke shot him dead. The Germans retreated, but Clarke pursued, shooting four more and capturing a fifth. In all, Clarke killed 19 of the enemy, capturing one. Decoration and Medals of Leo Clarke VC, on display at the Manitoba Museum, Winnipeg, Manitoba, October 19, 2014 Death Grave On 11 October 1916, Clarke's battalion was ordered forward to secure the newly captured Regina Trench which was still under heavy enemy artillery fire. Clarke was crouching in a hole at the rear of a trench when a shell exploded and the back of the trench caved in, burying him. His brother dug him out, but Clarke was paralyzed; the weight of the earth had crushed his back and injured his spine. Clarke was taken to No. 1 General Hospital, but died on 19 October. He is buried in Plot II, Row C, Grave 3A, in Etretat Churchyard Extension, 16 miles north of Le Havre, France. According to a contemporary newspaper article, shortly before his death he wrote his parents, stating: \\"I don't care so much for the Victoria Cross as getting home for a couple of months.\\" Legacy Clarke was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross in the spring of 1917. It was presented, by the Duke of Devonshire (Governor General of Canada in 1917), to Leo's father before a crowd of 30,000. In 1925, Pine Street in Winnipeg was renamed \\"Valour Road\\" in honour of Clarke and fellow Victoria Cross winners Frederick William Hall and Robert Shankland, all of whom lived on the 700 block. A plaque in his honour was erected by the Ontario Heritage Foundation at the Royal Canadian Legion branch in Waterdown. Clarke's story was featured in a Historica vignette, which was run nationally in Canada.

The title is a parody of the Australian current affairs program Today Tonight on Channel Seven. It was hosted by Chaser members Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel (\\"Chris and Craig\\"). The theme music to the show was the opening riff to the song \\"She Says What She Means\\" by Canadian band Sloan The show combined political satire, comedic discussion of the days events, and talkback from listeners with funny anecdotes on a given topic. Reucassel and Taylor also create satirical skits to play between program segments which lampoon commercial radio stations, current TV shows and topical world events. Other regular segments included the Small Talk Challenge, Two Types of People, Marketing Makeover and Pisslame Puns of the Week. One of the shows recurring segments, Coma FM was a parody of many aspects of Australian commercial radio. These included radio hosts' nicknames, the low pitched Americanised accent, strange noises (such as the station's callsign), forced laughter at poor jokes, an emphasis on playing new music and not repeating any tracks, segments that play the \\"greatest hits from the 80s, 90s and mid-90s\\", large amounts of advertising and competitions - especially those that give away \\"cold hard cash\\". Coma FM also mocks the target audience of commercial radio with the use of callers and comments on many controversial issues such as the Bali Nine. In late 2004, Chris and Craig took six weeks off to rejoin The Chaser team to produce an election special, The Chaser Decides, during the 2004 federal election campaign. The fill in hosts were Jason Whalley and Lindsay McDougall, aka Jay and the Doctor, who went on to become Triple J's breakfast show hosts from 2005 onwards. On 6 December 2005, Chris and Craig broadcast the final Today Today program, and announced they and the rest of the Chaser team would be back on television in 2006. The show was The Chaser's War on Everything. The new host for Triple J's drive timeslot was Robbie Buck. Chris and Craig returned to the airwaves in 2015 as part of Triple J's 40th birthday celebrations on sister radio station Double J. Bloody Sunday On 16 July 2006, Chris and Craig returned to Triple J for a temporary run with their show Bloody Sunday. They replaced Roy and HG's Sunday afternoon show This Sporting Life for four weeks. The show's first episode listed a single banana on eBay. On 10 December 2006, the program resumed in the same slot for 9 weeks over summer, billing itself as 'non-ratings period radio at its most desperate.' Listeners could often hear a TV in the background of the studio, as Chris and Craig liked to have the cricket or CNN on during the show. On the first show of 2007, Craig ran about an hour late for the show, illuminating the team's undivided devotion to the Sunday afternoon slot. The pair also predicted Naomi Robson's appearance on dancing with the stars in 2007.'Today Today' podcast from 7 January 2007.

They are best known for their TV shows and live performances, which are a combination of stunts and comedy. History The Dudesons consists of \\"four dudes from the Arctic Circle\\": Jukka Hild√©n (b. 1980), Jarppi Lepp√§l√§ (b. 1979), Jarno Laasala (b. 1979) and Hannu-Pekka \\"HP\\" Parviainen (b. 1981). All were born in the town of Sein√§joki, Finland, where Hild√©n, Lepp√§l√§, and Laasala became close friends while attending elementary school together, where they later met Parviainen and George Hutton who makes brief cameos in the videos and George Hutton who makes brief cameos in the videos As teenagers, the four became quite interested in snowboarding, skateboarding and downhill mountain biking. In the early 1990s, when Laasala got his first video camera, the group began filming their activities which eventually led to further pranks and extreme stunts. They created and sold VHS tapes which were filmed and edited by Laasala and subsequently their reputation began to grow in Sein√§joki. Original Finnish TV series In January 2000, Jarno Laasala obtained a job as an editor for a small Finnish cable TV-channel called MoonTV. He saw a possibility to make his own show out of all the stunts the Dudesons had filmed. After finishing high school, the Dudesons set up their own production company called Rabbit Films. The group immediately began shooting a self-financed pilot episode of their own show. This pilot was finished in August 2000 and the channel immediately green lit the first season, titled as \\"Maailmankiertue\\" (Worldtour). The episodes began airing in January 2001, and the series became the most popular show on MoonTV. In September, 2001, the Dudesons moved from MoonTV to a nationwide TV-channel Nelonen. The 2nd season, called \\"Extreme Duudsonit, Maailmankiertue 2\\", was first screened in 2002, and the same year the Dudesons were also elected as The Media Persons of the Year by the readers of Finland‚Äôs most popular youth magazine Suosikki. The 3rd (Maailmankiertue 3) and 4th seasons (Duudsoni El√§m√§√§) of Extreme Duudsonit ran respectively in 2003 and 2004. Recurring stunts and segments on the English-language version of the Dudesons includes: the \\"Human Dartboard,\\" playing pranks on \\"Mr. Hitler\\" and a vast array of other stunts with \\"absolute disregard for [their] own safety.\\" International career In 2003, the Dudesons made a decision to start making English-language material in order to find international distribution. Their following series, Duudsoni El√§m√§√§, was shot both in Finnish and English. The material was then edited both into Finnish-language series, and English language series. The Finnish series ran in 2004, while the English series had its international debut at Australian Channel V in February 2006. The American debut was on SpikeTV on July 6, 2006. The Dudesons can be seen on Bam Margera's Viva La Bam and Bam Margera Presents: Where the ‚ôØ$&% Is Santa?. By September 2007, the Dudesons Season 1 had been shown in 22 countries around the world, making it the most widespread Finnish TV-series of all time. The second season began in Australia on May 20, 2008 on Channel V. By the year 2010, different Dudesons seasons have been seen in over 150 countries. The Dudesons are also featured in the hit 2010 movie Jackass 3D, alongside Johnny Knoxville. All four Dudesons were seen on the red carpet at the Jackass 3D premiere.

With a budget of six million dollars, it would consist of the same line-up of all four Dudesons, and was set to be produced by both Johnny Knoxville and Jeff Tremaine. The Dudesons' own production company, Rabbit Films, decided to do the show with the co-operation of Dickhouse. \\"The Dudesons have balls where there should be brains and I am honored to be doing a show with them,\\" Knoxville says on the Dudesons's official website. However, after the episode Cowboys & Findians, MTV changed the time the episode would air due to unknown reasons. The Dudesons stated on their official Facebook page that the show would continue on July 16, 2010 and has since ended. The first episode was shown on MTV May 6, 2010.

The movie was released in the USA on July 11, 2006, by Warner Rhino. Despite mixed reviews from Finnish mainstream critics, the movie won the \\"Audience's Favorite Movie\\" at Jussi Awards, the Finnish equivalent of Oscars, with about 47% of votes. Dudesons Do Gumball In 2013, the Dudesons filmed and launched their own three-part series when taking part in the Gumball 3000 event. The show aired exclusively on Extreme Sports Channel, and followed the Finns as they travelled from Copenhagen to Monaco. This year they had a Cadillac SUV which had the look of a blue elephant. During the race through Europe they had their \\"Wheel of Fortune\\", which was used for different types of pranks.

Nixon had been accused of improprieties relating to a fund established by his backers to reimburse him for his political expenses. His place was in doubt on the Republican ticket, so he flew to Los Angeles and delivered a half-hour television address in which he defended himself, attacked his opponents, and urged the audience to contact the Republican National Committee (RNC) to tell it whether he should remain on the ticket. During the speech, he stated that he intended to keep one gift, regardless of the outcome: a black-and-white dog that his children had named Checkers, thus giving the address its popular name. Nixon came from a family of modest means, as he related in the address, and he had spent his time after law school in the military, campaigning for office, and serving in Congress. After his successful 1950 Senate campaign, his backers continued to raise money to finance his political activities. These contributions went to reimburse him for travel costs, postage for political mailings which he did not have franked, and similar expenses. Such a fund was not illegal at the time, but Nixon had made a point of attacking government corruption which exposed him to charges that he might be giving special favors to the contributors. The press became aware of the fund in September 1952, two months after Nixon's selection as General Dwight D. Eisenhower's running mate, and the story quickly grew until it threatened his place on the ticket. In an attempt to turn the tide of public opinion, Nixon broke off a whistle-stop tour of the West Coast to fly to Los Angeles and make a television and radio broadcast to the nation; the RNC raised the $75,000 to buy the television time. The idea for the Checkers reference came from Franklin Roosevelt's Fala speech, given eight years to the day before Nixon's address, in which Roosevelt mocked Republican claims that he had sent a destroyer to fetch his dog Fala, when the dog was supposedly left behind in the Aleutian Islands. Nixon's speech was seen and heard by about 60 million Americans, including the largest television audience to that time, and it led to an outpouring of public support. The RNC and other political offices received millions of telegrams and phone calls supporting Nixon. He was retained on the ticket, which swept to victory weeks later in November 1952. The Checkers speech was an early example of a politician using television to appeal directly to the electorate, but it has sometimes been mocked or denigrated. Checkers speech has come more generally to mean any emotional speech by a politician.  Background  In 1950, California Congressman Richard Nixon was elected to the Senate, defeating Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas. With the six-year term secured, Nixon campaign officials discussed how to further his career. Campaign manager Murray Chotiner and campaign chairman Bernie Brennan proposed a year-round campaign for the next six years, leading up to a re-election bid in 1956. Nixon's Southern California campaign treasurer Dana Smith suggested what became known as \\"the Fund,\\" to be administered by himself, which would pay for Nixon's political expenses. As Smith wrote to one potential contributor, money donated to the Fund was to be used for: As a senator, Nixon received an annual salary of $12,500 (). While he received an expense allowance of over $75,000, more than most senators received (because California was one of the most populous states), that money went to pay his staff of twelve and to cover the cost of stationery, telephone service, telegrams, and other office expenses. It also paid for the one set of round-trip airline tickets between Washington, D.C., and California that Nixon was allowed to buy for himself and his family at taxpayer expense each Congressional session. Nixon later characterized the attitude of his backers and aides as, \\"We want you to start campaigning right now for 1956, and we think the way to do it is to have available the funds to make speeches, make trips to California, and so forth.\\" Contributors were drawn only from his early supporters, and contributions were limited to $1,000 (). Nixon was not to be informed of the names of contributors; however, the fundraising letter stated that Nixon \\"will of course be very appreciative of your continuing interest.\\" By October 30, 1951, some $16,000 () had been raised, of which Nixon had spent approximately $12,000 (), principally from contributors in the Los Angeles area. The senator's Christmas card expense for 1950 and 1951 totaled $4,237.54 (). Despite the initial fundraising success, only $2,200 could be raised from November 1951 to July 1952, and an engraving bill was unpaid pending a hoped-for contribution of $500.  Fund crisis  President Harry Truman (left, seated) meets with Gov. Adlai Stevenson (right, seated) and Sen. John Sparkman In 1952, the Republicans chose Dwight D. Eisenhower as their presidential candidate, who then selected Nixon as his running mate, while the Democrats nominated Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson for president and Alabama Senator John Sparkman for vice president. The California delegation to the 1952 Republican National Convention, including Nixon, had been pledged to the state's \\"favorite son\\" candidate, Governor Earl Warren, who hoped to gain the presidential nomination in a brokered convention. Warren failed in his attempt to gain the nomination, and his supporters alleged that Nixon had worked behind the scenes to nominate Eisenhower despite his pledge to support Warren, and accused him of political opportunism for accepting the vice-presidential nomination. A disgruntled Warren supporter from Pasadena leaked the Fund story to several reporters. Nixon had campaigned for public integrity in his time in the Senate, even calling for the resignation of his own party chairman, Guy Gabrielson, when the latter was implicated in a loan scandal. By using such \\"indignant rhetoric,\\" Nixon had \\"weakened his own position\\" when the Fund crisis erupted. = Development of the story = On September 14, Nixon was asked about the Fund by reporter Peter Edson of the Newspaper Enterprise Association after the senator completed an appearance on Meet the Press. The candidate told Edson that the Fund was set up by his supporters to pay political expenses, explained that he had made no effort to find out the names of the donors, and referred Edson to Smith for further information. Edson, and other reporters, did contact Smith, who answered questions about the Fund. Three days later, Nixon's campaign train, the \\"Dick Nixon Special,\\" left Pomona, California, on a whistle-stop campaign tour of the West Coast and Rocky Mountain states. Menu from \\"Dick Nixon Special\\" Edson's column on the 18th, which included lengthy quotes by Smith on the supposed safeguards in the Fund, was later called by Nixon, \\"fair and objective.\\" However, Leo Katcher of the New York Post interviewed Smith and wrote a story under the headline \\"Secret Rich Men's Trust Fund Keeps Nixon in Style Far Beyond His Salary\\" and referred to the Fund donors as a \\"millionaires' club.\\" Nixon later praised Katcher's younger brother Edward, also a reporter, for his objectivity, but told him, \\"your brother Leo is a son of a bitch.\\" When the Dick Nixon Special arrived in Bakersfield, California, that day, the candidate, still oblivious to the developing furor, made a speech promoting the Republican ticket, and backing local congressman Thomas H. Werdel. After the speech, Republican activist Keith McCormac showed Nixon the Post story, which had been picked up by United Press under the headline \\"Nixon Scandal Fund.\\" According to McCormac, the senator collapsed into his seat in shock, and needed the help of Murray Chotiner, who was again Nixon's campaign manager, and Congressman Patrick J. Hillings (a Nixon confidant who had succeeded him in the House of Representatives) to return to his compartment. Democratic National Committee Chairman Stephen A. Mitchell called for Nixon's resignation from the ticket, saying that \\"Senator Nixon knows that [the Fund] is morally wrong. General Eisenhower knows that it is morally wrong. The American people know that it is morally wrong.\\" On the other hand, Republican Senator Karl Mundt called the story \\"a filthy maneuver by left-wingers, fellow travelers, and former communists.\\" Nixon issued a written statement explaining that the fund was to pay political expenses, in lieu of charging them to the taxpayer. Newspapers printed increasingly lurid accounts of the Fund and its beneficiary. The Sacramento Bee termed Nixon, \\"the pet prot√©g√© of a special interest group of rich southern Californians ... their front man, if not, indeed, their lobbyist.\\" The Pasadena Star-News, meanwhile, reported that one contributor had been appealed to on the grounds that the Nixon family needed a larger home and could not afford a maid. The train reached Marysville, California, on the morning of September 19, and Nixon gave a speech from the rear platform. As the train pulled out, while he remained on the rear platform, someone in the crowd yelled, \\"What about the $16,000?\\" (the amount then thought to have been contributed to the Fund). The candidate had the train stopped, and responded that he had been told that if he continued on his political course, \\"crooks and communists\\" would smear him. He told the crowd that the Fund had saved the taxpayer money, since it paid for matters that could have been paid for through his Senate expense allowance. He promised to throw the \\"crooks and communists\\" out of Washington. Dwight D. Eisenhower Eisenhower was on his own train, the Look Ahead, Neighbor, stumping through Missouri, and on the morning of the 19th, his campaign staff made him aware of the gathering storm. Eisenhower publicly called upon Nixon to release all documents relating to the Fund, somewhat to the dismay of Chotiner, who wondered, \\"What more does the general require than the senator's word?\\" Eisenhower aides contacted the senior Republican senator from California, William Knowland, and persuaded him to fly from Hawaii to join the Eisenhower train and be available as a potential replacement running mate. By this time, Nixon campaign headquarters was receiving a flood of messages, calling on the senator to resign from the ticket. When Eisenhower's train stopped for the candidate to make speeches, he faced protesters with signs reading \\"Donate Here to Help Poor Richard Nixon.\\" The influential Washington Post and New York Herald-Tribune both called for Nixon to leave the ticket, facts which Chotiner did not tell his candidate; Nixon learned them from a questioning reporter. Over 100 newspapers would editorialize about the Fund on the morning of September 20, opinion running two to one against Nixon. As his train stopped in Eugene, Oregon, Nixon was met with protestors' signs referencing his wife: \\"Pat, What Are You Going to Do With the Bribe Money?\\" and \\"No Mink Coats for Nixon‚ÄîJust Cold Cash.\\" He angrily responded with a phrase which would be echoed in the Checkers speech. After stating that there were no mink coats for the Nixons, the candidate said that he was \\"proud of the fact that Pat Nixon wears a good Republican cloth coat, and she's going to continue to.\\" Politicians from both parties opined on the propriety of the Fund and on what Nixon should do, most in accord with their political affiliation. Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson, though, publicly reserved judgment, leading Chotiner to suspect \\"that Stevenson is afraid of something here. I bet he has something to hide.\\" = Idea for a speech = On September 20, Republican National Committee official Bob Humphreys first suggested that Nixon give a televised speech to the nation to explain his position. RNC chairman and future Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield thought well of the idea, but was concerned about the expense. That evening, Nixon conferred with his aides, who unanimously urged him not to resign from the ticket. Humphreys called Chotiner at Nixon's hotel in Portland, Oregon that evening, and the campaign manager realized that the broadcast was the best opportunity for the candidate to make his case. Humphreys suggested Nixon appear on Meet the Press, but Chotiner rejected the suggestion, insisting that his candidate must have complete control of the broadcast \\"without interruption by possibly unfriendly press questions.\\" Humphreys mentioned that Summerfield was concerned about the cost of a television broadcast, but Chotiner noted that the cost of reprinting all campaign materials to reflect a change on the ticket would be far more than that of a telecast. The avalanche of editorial opinion continued the following day, Sunday, September 21, but Eisenhower continued to withhold judgment. The general considered asking retired Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts to evaluate the legality of the Fund, but time constraints ruled him out. Eisenhower decided to ask the Los Angeles law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher for a legal opinion, while asking the accounting firm Price Waterhouse to audit the Fund's records. Nixon, meanwhile, was encouraged by a supportive telegram from his mother and discouraged by one from former Minnesota governor Harold Stassen urging him to resign from the ticket. New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, a Nixon supporter, called to tell the senator that most Eisenhower aides favored his removal, and that if Nixon made the telecast, he should call for people to write to express their opinions. Dewey added that if the response was not strongly pro-Nixon, the senator should leave the ticket. Nixon finally got a call from Eisenhower at 10:00 pm, Pacific Time, Sunday night. Eisenhower expressed a reluctance to see him leave the ticket, and felt that he should have a chance to make his case to the American people. Nixon enquired if the general would be able to make a decision on whether to keep him as the running mate immediately after the broadcast, and when Eisenhower equivocated, he angrily burst out: \\"General, there comes a time in matters like this when you've either got to shit or get off the pot.\\" Eisenhower replied that it might take three or four days to gauge public reaction. = Preparation and setting = The El Capitan Theatre, now known as the Avalon Hollywood Through the night to the morning of September 22, Eisenhower and Nixon aides arranged the speech. The RNC worked to raise the $75,000 () needed to buy the half-hour of television time, while the Eisenhower staff secured sixty NBC stations to telecast the speech, with radio coverage from CBS and Mutual. The Nixon staff initially advocated a half-hour that evening, Monday, September 22, to follow the immensely popular I Love Lucy show, but when the candidate indicated he could not be ready that soon, settled for 6:30 pm Tuesday night, 9:30 pm in the East, following the almost equally popular Texaco Star Theater, starring Milton Berle. The campaign arranged to use the El Capitan Theatre, in Hollywood, where several NBC variety shows were then broadcast, since its lighting was superior to that of NBC Studios. Nixon told the press that he would be addressing the nation on television, but refused to take any questions about what he might say. On Monday morning, Nixon flew to Los Angeles, making notes for his speech aboard the plane. He jotted down the line he had said in Eugene regarding his wife's coat. He made notes concerning the family finances, upsetting Pat Nixon, who asked why people had to know their financial details. The senator responded that people in politics live in a fishbowl. He recalled the Fala speech, in which Franklin Roosevelt had sarcastically responded to Republican claims he had sent a destroyer to fetch his dog, Fala, and remembered the dog his children had recently received: A Texas traveling salesman named Lou Carrol had read a report that Pat Nixon said her children Tricia and Julie \\"longed\\" for a dog, and his own dog, an American Cocker Spaniel, had just had a litter. After a telegram exchange, he crated the puppy and shipped it by rail to the Nixons, and six-year-old Tricia Nixon named the dog \\"Checkers\\". Nixon decided that including the anecdote evoking FDR would needle his enemies and delight his friends. When the plane reached Los Angeles, Nixon secluded himself in a suite in The Ambassador Hotel, letting no one except his wife, Chotiner, and attorney and adviser William P. Rogers have any hint what he was planning. He called two professors he knew at his alma mater, Whittier College, seeking appropriate Abraham Lincoln quotes. They called back with two suggestions, one of which he used. Unwilling to have his message filtered, the candidate adamantly refused to provide the media with any advance text of his speech, convinced that it would reduce the size of his audience. Without any hard information on what would be said during the speech, rumors flew through the media. UPI reported that Nixon would resign from the ticket well before the scheduled time for the speech. On the evening of the 22nd, the media broke the story that Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson had a similar fund, as Chotiner had predicted. The Stevenson information had been leaked by Bob Humphreys at the RNC, but as he later ruefully noted, \\"Nobody paid much attention to it.\\" The morning of the 23rd, the day of the speech, brought the reports from the lawyers, who opined that it was legal for a senator to accept expense reimbursements, and from the accountants, who stated that there was no evidence of misappropriation of money. The Fund was to be dissolved, and gifts accepted since Nixon's nomination were to be accounted for as campaign contributions. Despite the reports, Eisenhower had second thoughts about relying on the success of the speech. He told an aide to call Governor Dewey, who was to call Nixon and instruct him to close his speech with his resignation from the ticket. Believing they had resolved the situation at last, Eisenhower and his staff had a relaxed dinner and began to prepare for his own speech that evening, before 15,000 Republican supporters in Cleveland. At 4:30 pm, Nixon, Chotiner, and Rogers were discussing where the public should be told to send their responses to the speech, when a Dewey aide telephoned for Nixon. Reluctantly, suspecting the reason for the call, Chotiner brought Nixon to the phone to speak with the New York governor. Dewey told Nixon that Eisenhower's aides were unanimous that Nixon must resign, though Dewey did not agree, and that Nixon was to so state at the end of his telecast. Nixon asked what the general wanted him to do. Dewey hedged, stating that he had not spoken with the presidential candidate himself, but that the word had come from such close aides to Eisenhower that the demand had to represent the general's view. The candidate replied that it was very late for him to change his remarks; Dewey assured him he need not do so, but simply add at the end his resignation from the ticket and his insistence that Eisenhower accept it. The governor suggested he even announce his resignation from the Senate and his intent to run in the special election which would follow‚Äîthe two-time losing presidential candidate was sure Nixon would be returned with a huge majority, thus vindicating him. Nixon remained silent for some time, and when Dewey asked him what he would do, the senator told him that he did not know, and if Eisenhower's aides wanted to find out, they could watch just like everyone else. Before slamming down the receiver, Nixon added, \\"And tell them I know something about politics, too!\\" Nixon, somewhat dazed by the conversation with Dewey, dressed for the speech and reviewed his notes. Chotiner came into the senator's room, and told him that if he was forced off the ticket, Chotiner would call a huge press conference and reveal all the maneuvering that had led to Nixon's departure; Chotiner added that the resulting furor would mean nothing to either of the two men, since they would be through with politics anyway. Nixon later stated that Chotiner's promise broke the tension and gave him a needed lift. The Nixons and the campaign staff journeyed to the El Capitan, where they were met by a cheering group of Young Republicans on the sidewalk outside, including future White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman. In Cleveland, General and Mamie Eisenhower, with the general's aides, prepared to watch the speech on television in the manager's office above the Cleveland Public Auditorium, where the presidential candidate was to speak.  Delivering the address  The El Capitan Theatre, at Nixon's insistence, was entirely deserted. Press members were confined to a nearby room, where they could watch on television; stenographers were standing by at the Ambassador to ensure an accurate transcript of Nixon's remarks for the press, who would be facing deadlines in the East. Chotiner and Rogers would watch from behind a screen in the theatre; Pat Nixon, wearing a dress knitted by supporters, would sit on stage a few feet from her husband. The chosen set was a \\"GI bedroom den\\" with a desk, two chairs, and bookshelves. The senator usually preferred to work from a memorized text, but would work from notes for this speech to make the talk sound more spontaneous. Nixon spent some time practicing movements for the cameramen and finally went into the dressing room with his wife for a few minutes of solitude. He told her that he did not think he could go through with it, but she reassured him. = Introduction and office expenses = The speech opened with Nixon sitting at the desk. He began, \\"My fellow Americans, I come before you tonight as a candidate for the Vice Presidency, and as a man whose honesty and integrity has been questioned.\\" The senator indicated that he would not follow the example of the Truman Administration and ignore charges, and that the best response to a smear \\"is to tell the truth\\". The candidate mentioned the $18,000 Fund, and that he was accused of taking money from a group of his supporters. After stating that the Fund was wrong if he had profited from it, if it had been conducted in secret, or if the contributors received special favors, the senator continued, Pat Nixon watches her husband deliver the Checkers speech. Nixon stated that no contributor to the fund got any service that an ordinary constituent would not have received, and then anticipated the skeptical questions, \\"Well, what did you use the fund for, Senator? Why did you have to have it?\\" In response to his rhetorical question, he explained salary and office allowances for senators. He went through different ways that political expenses could be met. One way was to be rich, but the senator stated that he was not rich. Another way was to put one's spouse on the Congressional office payroll, as, he stated, his Democratic rival, Senator John Sparkman, had done. Nixon did not feel comfortable doing that himself with so many deserving stenographers in Washington needing work, though Pat Nixon was a \\"wonderful stenographer\\" and sometimes helped out in the office as a volunteer. At this point, the camera turned from Nixon for the first time to reveal Pat Nixon sitting alongside the desk. The senator indicated he could not continue his law practice, as some Congressmen did, due to the distance to California, and in any event he felt that practicing law while a lawmaker was a conflict of interest. Thus, he indicated, he had found that the best way to pay for political expenses not within his means was to allow contributors to do so. Nixon proffered the legal and accounting opinions as proof of his statements. = Family finances, coat and dog = Nixon, continuing to ask skeptical rhetorical questions, indicated that some might feel that even with the opinions, he might have found some way to personally benefit. In response to his own question, the senator detailed his background and financial situation, beginning with his birth in Yorba Linda, and the family grocery store in which the Nixon boys helped out. He alluded to his work in college and law school, his service record, and stated that at the end of the war, he and Pat Nixon had $10,000 in savings, all of it patriotically in government bonds. The candidate gave the dollar amounts of small inheritances that the Nixons had received from relatives, before turning to their life in Washington: Excerpt from the notes from which Nixon delivered the Checkers speech As the senator discussed their finances, the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze was because she did not know exactly what he would say, and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed- against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and that he and his wife owned no stocks or bonds. While the senator made these points, Murray Chotiner \\"let out shouts of glee\\" in his screened booth. As Chotiner exulted, Nixon moved ahead with the lines \\"that would give the speech its name, make it famous, and notorious\\": Nixon expressed pleasure that Stevenson, whom he termed a man who inherited wealth from his father, could run for president. But people \\"of modest means\\" must also get a chance, and the candidate recited the quotation attributed to Lincoln: \\"Remember Abraham Lincoln, you remember what he said: 'God must have loved the common people‚ÄîHe made so many of them.'\\" = Attack on Democrats; request for public to write = Nixon then called for Stevenson to give a full accounting of his own fund, and a full list of the donors. He also called for Senator Sparkman, who, as Nixon repeated, had put his wife on the payroll, to state fully any outside income he might have had. \\"Because, folks, remember, a man that's to be President of the United States, a man that's to be Vice President of the United States must have the confidence of all the people. And that's why I'm doing what I'm doing, and that's why I suggest that Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Sparkman since they are under attack should do what I am doing.\\" As the senator made this point, Eisenhower, sitting in the Cleveland office, slammed his pencil down, realizing that he would not be allowed to be the only major party candidate whose finances would evade scrutiny. Eisenhower had benefited from a favorable Act of Congress, allowing the income from his bestselling memoirs to be considered capital gains. Nixon warned that other smears would be made against him, and many of the same commentators who were attacking him now had also attacked him for his role in the Alger Hiss case, for which he made no apologies. He then rose to his feet, came out from behind the desk, and continued: The senator alleged that Stevenson had downplayed the threat of communism, and was thus unfit to be president. He affirmed that Eisenhower was the only man fit to lead the country in ridding the government of corruption and communism. Reading parts of a letter from the wife of a serviceman fighting in the Korean War, who, despite her financial woes, had scraped together $10 to donate to the campaign, Nixon promised that he would never cash that check. With less than three minutes left in the allotted time, Nixon finally addressed the question: Would he stay or would he go? He indicated that he did not think he should go. \\"Let me say this: I don't believe that I ought to quit because I'm not a quitter. And, incidentally, Pat's not a quitter. After all, her name was Patricia Ryan and she was born on St. Patrick's Day, and you know the Irish never quit.\\" Seizing on the fact that the Republican National Convention had routinely given the RNC the power to fill vacancies on the ticket, Nixon evaded Eisenhower's power as the general again slammed his pencil down, this time breaking it: Advancing towards the camera, the candidate completed the speech by praising Eisenhower, \\"He's a great man. And a vote for Eisenhower is a vote for what's good for America.\\"  Aftermath  = Candidates and public = Nixon was initially convinced that the speech was a failure. Despite the congratulations of Rogers and Chotiner, and the fact that one of the cameramen had tears running down his face, he reproved himself for not mentioning the address of the Republican National Committee. Though the Young Republicans continued their applause as the Nixon party left the theatre, the candidate fixed on an Irish Setter running alongside his car as it pulled away from the curb. \\"Well, we made a hit in the dog world anyway.\\" Despite the senator's despair, his wife was convinced that her husband had vindicated himself. Over sixty million Americans had watched or listened to the speech, including the largest television audience up to that point. Nixon had left the Ambassador with the lobby quiet; he returned to a mob scene, and the candidate was soon surrounded by well-wishers congratulating him. The party was able to get through to his suite, and after a few minutes of tense quiet, calls and telegrams began to pour in \\"from everywhere\\" praising the speech and urging him to remain on the ticket‚Äîbut no word came from Eisenhower in Cleveland. The Cleveland Public Auditorium, site of the Republican fundraiser on September 23, 1952 In Cleveland, as the speech concluded, General Eisenhower turned to RNC Chairman Summerfield, \\"Well, Arthur, you sure got your money's worth.\\" Mamie Eisenhower was in tears, and the general told her that Nixon was a completely honest man. The 15,000 supporters waiting for Eisenhower to speak had heard the Checkers speech over the hall's public address system, and when Congressman George H. Bender took the microphone and asked the crowd, \\"Are you in favor of Nixon?\\", pandemonium ensued. As the crowd below chanted, \\"We want Nixon!\\", Eisenhower quickly revised his speech. Both Eisenhower's speech to the excited crowd and telegram to his running mate were noncommittal. The general applauded his running mate for his speech, but stated that the two had to meet face to face before a final decision could be made. While Eisenhower affirmed that the RNC had the power to elect a replacement candidate, Eisenhower indicated that the committee would, most likely, be guided by his wishes. Eisenhower asked Nixon to meet with him in person in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the general's campaign was next scheduled to go. Eisenhower's telegram was delayed in transmission and lost among the flood being sent to Nixon's suite, and the latter learned of his running mate's position from a wire service report. When he heard of Eisenhower's posture, Nixon's happiness at what he had finally been convinced was a tour de force turned to fury, and he stated that if the speech did not satisfy the general, nothing he could do would. He called in his secretary, Rose Mary Woods, and dictated a telegram to the RNC resigning from the ticket. As Woods left the room with her notes, Chotiner stopped her, took the sheet, and ripped it up. While Chotiner understood Nixon's rage, he felt that the resignation was premature. The campaign manager urged Nixon simply to allow the public wave of support to pressure Eisenhower. He suggested that instead of going to Wheeling as Eisenhower had requested, that they resume the train tour in Missoula, Montana. Nixon sent Eisenhower a curt acknowledgment of his telegram, and a suggestion that they meet the following week in Washington, D.C. Chotiner then called Summerfield, telling him that Nixon felt he had been abused enough, and would not meet with Eisenhower until Summerfield was able to promise, on his word of honor, that the senator would be confirmed as nominee at that meeting. \\"Dick is not going to be placed in the position of a little boy going somewhere to beg for forgiveness.\\" Just before the Nixon party left for the airport, Nixon friend and journalist Bert Andrews managed to reach him by phone. Andrews told the senator that he should go to Wheeling; that public reaction had already foreordained the outcome. He advised Nixon that he should accede to Eisenhower's desire to make the inevitable decision in his own way, advice Nixon acknowledged \\"had the ring of truth.\\" Nonetheless, the Nixon party flew to Missoula. Supportive telegrams sent after the Checkers speech By this time, the first wave of what would eventually be more than four million letters, telegrams, postcards, and phone calls had flooded into RNC headquarters and other political offices. While a later study found that only about 7 percent of these communications addressed any substantive issue, they still ran 75 to one in favor of Nixon. Nixon skeptics joined in; both Stassen and Dewey sent congratulatory telegrams. Many letters included contributions to help pay for the cost of the broadcast; the RNC eventually recouped four-fifths of the $75,000 cost. Newspaper switchboards were jammed with calls from people seeking the RNC's address, while Western Union was caught off guard by Nixon's request that listeners wire the RNC, and had no extra help on hand. Checkers herself received enough dog food to last a year, and hundreds of collars, leashes, and toys. Politicians generally reacted along party lines, with Senator Mundt stating, \\"Nixon's speech is complete vindication against one of the most vicious smears in American history.\\" Democratic Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico stated, \\"I wish he had talked about the 18,000 bucks‚Äînot the puppy dog ... Suppose someone sets up a fund to buy my meals. I could say I didn't get one red cent of the money.\\" Preprinted postcard sent by Nixon to supporters who had written after the speech On the morning of September 24, Summerfield and Humphreys called Nixon at his Missoula hotel. After securing his agreement to fly to Wheeling if Eisenhower agreed to Chotiner's terms, the two reached Eisenhower and campaign leader New Hampshire Governor Sherman Adams in Portsmouth, Ohio, en route to Wheeling, and briefed them on the conversation with Nixon and on the flood of communications from the public. The general and governor agreed that Nixon could come to Wheeling with the assurance he would remain on the ticket. After making speeches in Missoula and at a stop in Denver, and after Eisenhower made his own speech announcing that his running mate had been the victim of an \\"attempted smear,\\" Nixon arrived in Wheeling late in the day on the 24th. Eisenhower came to the airport to meet the plane, and hurried up the steps to greet the Nixons when the door was opened. The candidates waved at the crowd of 3,000 which had come to meet the plane, and rode together, with Nixon in place of honor, to a rally at City Island Stadium as Eisenhower chatted to Nixon as if the crisis had never occurred. At the stadium, Eisenhower introduced Nixon as a \\"colleague\\" who had been subject to \\"a vicious and unprincipled attack\\" but who had \\"vindicated himself\\" and who \\"stood higher than ever before.\\" The presidential candidate finished by reading two telegrams, one from Nixon's mother assuring the general of her son's integrity, and the second from Summerfield stating that the RNC had voted unanimously to retain Nixon on the ticket. Nixon then spoke, telling the crowd that this was one of two moments when he was most proud to be an American; the other had been at the victory parade in New York in 1945, when he had seen General Eisenhower go by. He called the Wheeling rally \\"the greatest moment of my life.\\" = Media reaction = Editorial reaction to the address was divided. The New York Times, which had criticized Nixon, and had even run stories with claims that he was under criminal investigation for the Fund, praised Nixon's \\"composure and assurance.\\" The New York Journal American gushed, \\"He was in our opinion, simply magnificent. We know of no other way to say it.\\" The Pittsburgh Press called the address \\"an extraordinary speech.\\" The Mobile Register stated that the Fund crisis \\"confronted [Nixon] with an unsought opportunity which he made the most of.\\" However, some newspapers disagreed. The Baltimore Sun noted that Nixon \\"did not deal in any way with the underlying question of propriety,\\" while the St. Louis Post-Dispatch called the address \\"a carefully contrived soap opera.\\" Columnist Walter Lippmann called the wave of support for Nixon \\"disturbing ... with all the magnification of modern electronics, simply mob law;\\" discussing the speech with a dinner guest, he said, \\"That must be the most demeaning experience my country has ever had to bear.\\" Columnist Thomas Stokes criticized Eisenhower for equivocating on the question of his running mate until \\"the young man himself‚Äîthe accused‚Äîhad to step in and take over. And how he took over!\\" Through his presidency, Eisenhower would continue to be accused of being indecisive. Nixon refused to answer further questions about the Fund, and attention turned to Stevenson's fund, especially as its details became clear. Governor Stevenson's fund, which proved to total $146,000, had been used for such expenditures as Christmas gifts to reporters, dues for private clubs, and to hire an orchestra for a dance his son was hosting. Taking a leaf from Nixon's book, the Democrats refused to answer questions about the governor's fund. Both parties were eager to bury the matter, and the story died.  Legacy  Wheeling Island Stadium (then City Island Stadium), site of the Republican rally on September 24, 1952 With The New York Times finding that Nixon's performance had given the Republican ticket \\"a shot in the arm\\", Eisenhower and Nixon swept to victory in November, with the Republicans narrowly taking both Houses of Congress. According to Nixon biographer Conrad Black, the speech earned Nixon supporters throughout Middle America which he would keep through the rest of his life, and who would continue to defend him after his death. Critics, however, would later see the address as the \\"ultimate expression\\" of the controversial politician's \\"phoniness.\\" Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose stated that part of the audience considered the address \\"one of the most sickening, disgusting, maudlin performances ever experienced.\\" In their analysis of the speech published just before Nixon's election as president in 1968, Robert S. Cathcart and Edward A. Schwarz suggested that while Nixon \\"met the accusation head-on and accomplished his immediate goals successfully, he ultimately created an image which led to a decline in his political career.\\" The address was an unprecedented demonstration of the power of television to galvanize large segments of the American people to act in a political campaign. However, the onslaught of negative media attention leading up to the address \\"left its scars\\" on Nixon, and the future president never returned to the easy relationship with the press that he had enjoyed during his congressional career. His oft-stated view that the media was the enemy came to play a part in his downfall. The Nixons' black-and-white cocker spaniel Checkers (1952‚Äì1964) Nixon celebrated the anniversary of the speech each year. The future president disliked the fact that the address soon became popularly known as the \\"Checkers speech.\\" In his 1962 book, Six Crises (the Fund crisis being one of the six), he would object to the term, \\"as though the mention of my dog was the only thing that saved my political career.\\" Nixon preferred to call the address \\"the Fund speech,\\" and made it required reading for his speechwriters. As time passed, the Checkers speech became denigrated, and Nixon biographer Earl Mazo suggested that much of the attitude of \\"I don't like Nixon, but I don't know why,\\" which contributed to the failure of his 1960 presidential run, can be traced to the Checkers speech. Other commentators suggested that had he not made the Checkers speech, Nixon might have won in 1960. Nixon retorted that without the Checkers speech, he would not have been around to run in 1960. Checkers died in 1964 and was buried in Wantagh, New York, at Long Island's Bide-A-Wee Pet Cemetery. William Safire described the adoption of \\"Checkers speech\\" as an idiom, used to refer to any emotionally charged speech by a politician. In 1999, 137 scholars of American public address were asked to recommend speeches for inclusion on a list of \\"the 100 best American political speeches of the 20th century,\\" based on \\"social and political impact, and rhetorical artistry.\\" This speech placed 6th on the list. Despite the many criticisms of the speech in later years, Hal Bochin (who wrote a book about Nixon's rhetoric) suggests that Nixon succeeded at the time because of his use of narrative, spinning a story which resonated with the public: See also * 1952 United States presidential election  References  =Explanatory notes= =Citations= = Bibliography =     =Other sources=   (Consumer bundle)  * * Further reading  Text and audio mp3 of the speech from AmericanRhetoric.com * Video and entire transcript from Watergate.info * \\"Checkers Speech\\" Part 1 At YouTube, which may properly host it as the Checkers speech was aired without a copyright notice and is not copyrighted. * \\"Checkers Speech\\" Part 2 At YouTube * * Category:1952 in Los Angeles Category:1952 in American politics Category:1952 United States presidential election Category:1952 speeches Category:September 1952 events Category:Animals in politics Category:Political scandals in the United States Category:Speeches by Richard Nixon Category:United States presidential pets ","title":"Checkers speech"},{"id":"1160288","text":"The Verulamium Forum Inscription (tentatively dated to AD 79, during the reign of the emperor Titus) is one of the many Roman inscriptions in Britain. It is also known as the \\"Basilica inscription\\", as it is believed to have been attached to the basilica of Verulamium (on the edge of modern St Albans). The surviving fragments have been reconstructed as a large dedication slab (approx. 4.3m x 1.0m) on display at Verulamium Museum. The fragments were found in 1955 during construction work in the yard of St Michael's School, St Albans. The find-spot lay near the north-east entrance to the forum and basilica of Verulamium.

History In the late 1930s, San Francisco was a major center for radio development for the western United States. In 1939, General Electric established a powerful shortwave station in conjunction with the opening of the Golden Gate International Exposition on San Francisco Bay at Treasure Island.\\"International Broadcast Station KGEI: 1939‚Äì1994\\" (theradiohistorian.org) In August 1940, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) gave a demonstration of the then new technology of frequency modulation (FM) broadcasting at the National Association of Broadcasters convention being held in the city.\\"RCA to Display FM at Convention\\", Broadcasting, August 1, 1940, page 122. In May 1940, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that effective January 1, 1941 it was establishing a broadcast band for FM stations, operating on 40 channels spanning 42‚Äì50 MHz, with the first five channels reserved for educational stations.\\"FCC Order No. 67\\", Federal Register, May 25, 1940, page 2011. That same month the San Francisco Unified School District filed an application to construct a new educational FM station, operating on 42.1 MHz with 1,000 watts. The original station application, filed May 24, 1940, specified use of General Electric transmitters, but this was changed in January 1941 to specify an RCA FM-1-B transmitter.History Cards for KALW (Federal Communications Commission) KALW was constructed at Samuel Gompers Trades School and began test transmissions on March 10, 1941,\\"Interesting New School Installation\\" by K.

KALW was instrumental in helping KQED television sign on the air in 1954 as one of the first non-commercial educational television stations in the country, by providing technical training, studio space, and engineering advice to the KQED founding staff. KALW provided Chinese-language simulcasts of KGO-TV newscasts in the 1970s, before local Asian language newscasts became established. During the 1970s and 1980s KALW also aired live coverage of SFUSD sporting events, the last such regular live coverage of high school sports in San Francisco broadcasting. While KALW's original transmitter had not been used since the switch to the modern FM band in the late 1940s, it was still located at John O'Connell Technical High School until the school was demolished in the mid-1990s. In late October 2006, KALW suffered an antenna malfunction. The station continued to transmit with only three percent of normal power, causing many listeners to think the station had ceased broadcasting, although the audio stream was still available via the website. Fellow public broadcaster KQED-FM allowed KALW the use of their backup transmitter on San Bruno Mountain during the repair process. On November 2, 2006, station general manager Matt Martin posted an update on the station's website explaining the problem and expressing his appreciation to KQED-FM for its technical assistance.  License renewal challenge  In 1997, a group of full and part-time KALW employees filed a petition with the FCC to deny renewal of KALW's broadcast license, alleging that station management had covered up violations of hiring rules and had lied about required record keeping. The case was inactive for several years and, according to KALW's website, the group that filed the petition, known as Golden Gate Public Radio, was defunct. In July 2004, the FCC resurrected the case. While it issued only a warning to KALW about its employment practices, the commission determined that there was sufficient evidence supporting misrepresentation allegations to warrant formal hearings.\\"In the Matter of San Francisco Unified School District for Renewal of License for Station KALW (FM)\\" (MB Docket No. 04-191), July 16, 2004, FCC Record (Vol 19, No. 16), pages 13326-13340. The hearings concluded in June 2005, and FCC Chief Administrative Law Judge Richard Sippel ruled in April 2006 to grant a limited two-year license renewal for KALW, while reducing a fine for public file violations from $300,000 to $10,000. In its defense to the FCC, KALW management showed evidence of its meritorious service to the community. The school district also argued for a hardship case, saying it was incapable of paying the $10,000 fine. (For instance, local school programs for children had recently been cut from the district's budget.) The judge disagreed with that assertion, however, and the SFUSD was given two years to pay the fine.\\"In the Matter of San Francisco Unified School District for Renewal of License for Station KALW (FM)\\" Federal Communications Commission April 6, 2006 See also *List of community radio stations in the United States  References   External links  *KALW Website *West Coast Live *FCC History Cards for KALW (covering 1940-1980) *\\"San Francisco: 1941 to Date\\", Public School Broadcasting to the Classroom, by Carroll Atkinson, 1942, pages 138-141.

Some post-Classical Hollywood Westerns began to question the ideals and style of the traditional Western. These Revisionist Westerns placed the context of the Native Americans and cowboys alike in a darker setting. They depicted a morally questionable world where the heroes and villains oftentimes resembled each other (see antihero, sympathetic villain) more closely than had previously been shown. The concept of right and wrong became blurred in a world where actions could no longer be said to be good or bad. Whereas in a majority of the classical western films, in which the ethics were clear and defined in \\"black and white\\", the Revisionist film looked to paint a moral \\"grey\\" area where people had to adapt in order to survive. This led to depictions of outlaws such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, in which the protagonists of the film are outlaw bank robbers. The subgenre is also apparent in many Italian-made Spaghetti Westerns as well as Australian meat pie Westerns. Hollywood revisionist Westerns Most Westerns from the 1960s to the present have revisionist themes. Many were made by emerging major filmmakers who saw the Western as an opportunity to expand their criticism of American society and values into a new genre. The 1952 Supreme Court holding in Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, and later, the end of the Production Code in 1968 broadened what Westerns could portray and made the revisionist Western a more viable genre. Films in this category include Sam Peckinpah's Ride the High Country (1962) and The Wild Bunch (1969), Arthur Penn's Little Big Man (1970) and Robert Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971). Beginning in the late 1960s, independent filmmakers produced revisionist and hallucinogenic films, later retroactively identified as the separate but related subgenre of \\"Acid Westerns\\", that radically turn the usual trappings of the Western genre inside out to critique both capitalism and the counterculture. Monte Hellman's The Shooting and Ride in the Whirlwind (1966), Alejandro Jodorowsky's El Topo (1970), Robert Downey Sr.'s Greaser's Palace (1972), Alex Cox's Walker (1987), and Jim Jarmusch's Dead Man (1995) fall into this category. Films made during the early 1970s are particularly noted for their hyper-realistic photography and production design. Notable examples using sepia tinting and muddy rustic settings are Little Big Man (1970), McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971) and The Culpepper Cattle Co. (1972). Other films, such as those directed by Clint Eastwood, were made by professionals familiar with the Western as a criticism and expansion against and beyond the genre. Eastwood's The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and Unforgiven (1992) made use of strong supporting roles for women and Native Americans. The films The Long Riders (1980) and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) are revisionist films dealing with the James Gang. Jeffrey Wright's portrayal of Black Confederate Daniel Holt riding with the Missouri Bushwhackers in Ride with the Devil tells the stories of the Kansas Border War and Lawrence Massacre. Spaghetti Westerns Foreign markets, which had imported the Western since their silent film inception, began creating their own Westerns early on. However, a unique brand of Western emerged in Europe in the 1960s as an offshoot of the Revisionist Western. The Spaghetti Western became the nickname, originally disparagingly, for this broad subgenre, so named because of their common Italian background, directing, producing and financing (with occasional Spanish involvement). Originally they had in common the Italian language, low budgets, and a recognizable highly fluid, violent, minimalist cinematography that helped eschew (some said \\"de-mythologize\\") many of the conventions of earlier Westerns. They were often made in Spain, especially Tabernas Desert, in Almer√≠a, the dry ruggedness of which resembled the American Southwest's. Director Sergio Leone played a seminal role in this movement. A subtle theme of the conflict between Anglo and Hispanic cultures plays through all these movies. Leone conceived of the Old West as a dirty place filled with morally ambivalent figures, and this aspect of the Spaghetti Western came to be one of its universal attributes, as seen in a wide variety of these films, beginning with one of the first popular Spaghetti Westerns, Gunfight at Red Sands (1964), and visible elsewhere in those starring John Philip Law (Death Rides a Horse) or Franco Nero, and in the Trinity series. Red Western The Ostern, or Red Western, was the Soviet Bloc's reply to the Western, and arose in the same period as the Revisionist Western. While many red Westerns concentrated on aspects of Soviet/Eastern-European history, some others like the Czechoslovak Lemonade Joe (1964) and the East German The Sons of the Great Mother Bear (1966) tried to de-mythologize the Western in different ways: Lemonade Joe by sending up the more ridiculous aspects of marketing, and The Sons of the Great Mother Bear by showing how American natives were exploited repeatedly, told from the Native American rather than white settler viewpoint. A Man from the Boulevard des Capucines (1987) was a sensitive satire on the Western film itself. It was also highly unusual in being one of the few examples in Soviet film of post-modernism.

Prior to that, he was formerly a professional soccer player,OT win over Iowa gives Ohio St. Rose Bowl berth , Associated Press, November 14, 2009. who last played for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer. Barclay initially skipped college, opting instead to sign a Project-40 contract with MLS in 2001, at the age of 18, which allocated him to the Tampa Bay Mutiny. Barclay made a significant impact on a very bad Mutiny team as a rookie, appearing in 23 games, 12 starts, and scoring three goals and two assists. The Mutiny was contracted after the 2001 season; Barclay was selected 8th overall in the 2002 MLS Allocation Draft by the San Jose Earthquakes. Barclay did not make much of an impact on the side that had just won MLS Cup, disappointingly only appearing in 12 games, and registering no goals or assists. He was traded to D.C. United in exchange for a draft pick, but disappointed in D.C. as well; he only appeared in three games for United, as coach Ray Hudson preferred not to play young players. He was again traded after the 2003 season, joining the Columbus Crew, his fourth team in four seasons. He made little impact on the Crew, however, again appearing in only three games in 2004. After appearing only once in the 2005 season, Barclay was released by Columbus on November 15, 2005. Barclay represented the U.S. national team at the Under-18, Under-20, and Under-23 levels, but his playing time with those teams dwindled as he was unable to break into an MLS side. Stifled by the lack of playing time and hampered by injuries, Barclay retired from soccer. He began learning how to kick field goals and was able to walk on at The Ohio State University. As a junior, Barclay was second on the placekicking depth chart at Ohio State Story expired! (HometownAnnapolis.com) until Aaron Pettrey was injured on October 31, 2009 in a game against New Mexico State. Barclay became the starting kicker going forward. He scored the game winning kick against the Iowa Hawkeyes on November 14, 2009. The win meant that Ohio State would play in the Rose Bowl, as well as ensuring Ohio State at least a share of the 2009 Big Ten Championship. Barclay started off the 2010 season well, tying the Ohio State record with 5 field goals on 6 attempts in week 2 against Miami (FL). He was named the Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week for his efforts. He would finish the season 20-for-24 on field goals. Barclay never missed a point after touchdown in his career as a Buckeye.

It was found in 1977 during excavations by C.M. Stibbe.see the Dutch lemma on C.M. Stibbe. It reads: : (?)IEI STETERAI POPLIOSIO VALESIOSIO : SVODALES MAMARTEICIL I2 2832a (\\"The (?) dedicated this, as companions of Publius Valerius, to Mars\\") This inscription has attracted attention for several reasons. Its language has been identified as Old Latin or a closely related dialect. It is important for comparative Indo-European grammar, as it is the only Latin inscription to show the ending -osio for the genitive singular of the thematic noun declension. Latin later has -ƒ´ as the ending for this case, but by comparison with Sanskrit, Mycenaean and Homeric Greek and other languages, it becomes clear that -osio is a far earlier form. detail of the Lapis Satricanus Another point of interest is the presence of the word suodales (Classical Latin sodales). In historic times, this word referred to a member of a sodalites, a religious fraternity or brotherhood who met for ritual meals or as a burial organization. \\"Since the suod- element in suodales is cognate with the English word 'swear'\\", writes Gary Forsythe, \\"the term suggests that some kind of oath was taken, binding the members of the group together in a common purpose.\\" Forsythe uses this and that this was a dedication to Mars to suggest this indicates the existence of an armed group of sworn followers, similar to \\"the war bands led by Homeric heroes, the warlike aristocratic companions of the Macedonian kings during the classical period, and the war bands surrounding the Celtic and Germanic chieftains described by Caesar and Tacitus\\".Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome (Berkeley: University of California, 2005), p. 199 Forsythe notes this puts a new light on the account of the Battle of the Cremera, an event where the entire gens Fabii fought as a group the armed men of the rival town of Veii only to be tragically defeated.Forsythe, A Critical History, p. 198 A third point of interest to historians and archaeologists of early Latium is the name preserved on the inscription. The archaic name of Poplios Valesios is rendered in Classical Latin as \\"Publius Valerius\\". That has inevitably led to speculation that the inscription refers to none other than the famous Publius Valerius Publicola, the patrician ally of Lucius Junius Brutus who dominates the list of early consuls recorded by the Fasti Capitolini and is credited, in traditional accounts, as one of the primary founders of the Roman Republic. Positive identification is at least somewhat problematic because the town of Satricum was not part of Roman territory when Publius Valerius was consul. However, the \\"lapis\\" itself may not have been dedicated in Satricum in the first place since it was found as part of a collection of recycled material used in the construction of a temple in the town, and it could well have been imported from elsewhere.

He scored 35 tries in 63 tests for New Zealand, making him one of the highest try scorers in international rugby union history, and was part of the New Zealand team that won the first Rugby World Cup in 1987. He also played rugby league for the Auckland Warriors in their first two seasons. He is the former head coach of the Blues in Super Rugby, and the Japan and Italy national teams. In recent years, he has spoken openly about his battles with depression and been honoured for his services to mental health. Early life and family Kirwan was born in Auckland on 16 December 1964, the son of Patrick and Patricia Madeline Kirwan. He was educated at De La Salle College in Auckland. His paternal grandfather, Jack Kirwan, was a gifted wing three-quarter/five- eighths originally from Reefton who was in the same side as All Blacks George Nepia, and the Brownlie brothers in the early 1920s and when they lifted the Ranfurly Shield from in 1922. Jack was also in the Hawke's Bay‚ÄìPoverty Bay side that played the Springboks in 1921. Jack later went to Auckland in 1924 where he was captain of the Marist Brothers Old Boys senior team and was included for the Auckland side that year making 10 appearances. Playing career =Rugby union= Kirwan played for Marist Brothers Old Boys RFC and Auckland domestically, winning 142 caps with the latter during an era when the side dominated the NPC and Ranfurly Shield. From 1985 to 1989 he played in Italy, at Benetton Treviso, club where he won the Italian championship in 1989. One of his partners in the Italian team was the All Black Craig Green, Kirwan's teammate in the 1987 World Cup won by the New Zealanders. After his spell in rugby league, he finished his rugby union playing career with NEC in Japan from 1997‚Äì1999. Kirwan played 63 test matches for New Zealand from 1984 until 1994. Kirwan played a major role in the All Blacks‚Äô 23 test unbeaten run from 1987 to 1990, including winning the 1987 World Cup. He scored 10 tries in five tests against Wales and Australia during 1988. In all he scored 35 test tries for New Zealand. He also scored 67 tries in all appearances with the All Blacks (including non test matches) which is still the national record. His total of 199 first class tries remains a New Zealand record. In 1986 Kirwan and David Kirk were the only All Blacks not to join the 'rebel' New Zealand Cavaliers team that traveled to apartheid-era South Africa after a New Zealand court held that the All Blacks' playing in that country would be inconsistent with their mission of promoting rugby. As a result, he and Kirk were the only ones not temporarily barred from playing with the All Blacks upon their return. =Rugby league= At age 30 Kirwan signed for the newly formed rugby league club Auckland Warriors for the 1995 ARL season, with a mutual option for 1996. Playing on the wing, he was a staunch opponent of the ARL during the Super League war. Kirwan was the Warriors' top try scorer in the 1996 season. Coaching career In 2001, Kirwan was an assistant coach with the Auckland Blues, his first professional coaching role. In 2002, Kirwan moved to Italy to become the coach of the Italian national rugby team, which under his guidance recorded two victories over Wales in 2003 and Scotland in 2004. After a winless 2005 Six Nations campaign, he was relieved of his managerial duties on 8 April 2005. At the start of 2007 Kirwan was appointed the coach of the Japan national rugby union team. Interviewed by the Daily Yomiuri, Kirwan said: \\"The level of rugby has improved greatly in Japan in the last ten years and they did well at the last World Cup. But their recent performances at national level have [not been good]. I want to find that 'Samurai Spirit' that all the players can identify with. And then that style of rugby can start to spread downwards throughout the country.\\" On 9 April 2007 the national team was featured at their first training camp since Kirwan's appointment in the NHK national news, a sign of the growing expectation and interest in his team. He said in front of the camera: \\"We want to be the world's fittest team\\". He added that he wanted Japan to play to its strengths which he believed were speed and agility, and to play rugby that \\"big men don't like.\\" At the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Japan drew 12‚Äì12 with Canada, breaking a 16-year, 13-match losing streak. Kirwan remained head coach of Japan through the 2011 Rugby World Cup. In July 2012, Kirwan was announced as the new coach of the Blues. After (boldly) re-applying for the role for 2016 and beyond, Kirwin was forced to step down following just three wins - an all-time franchise low - in the 2015 season. Personal life Kirwan is married to Fiorella, Lady Kirwan, with three children: Francesca, a beach volleyball player; Niko, a New Zealand football representative; and Luca, who has represented New Zealand internationally in rowing at under-23 level. Kirwan speaks fluent Italian and good Japanese, a result of a playing career in Italy and coaching career in Japan. Kirwan has openly spoken of his battle with depression, and is actively involved in mental health and depression awareness campaigns in New Zealand. He has written about his depression in the books All Blacks Don't Cry and Stand by Me. In 2016 he had his DNA heritage investigated for a television programme, which found a link to the American Kennedy clan. In 2018, Niko made his All Whites debut. Honours and awards In the 1989 New Year Honours, Kirwan was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to rugby. In the 2007 Queen's Birthday Honours, Kirwan was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to mental health.

Most examples of the genre were composed between 1600 and 1650.  Description  This use of the word concerto differs considerably from the more modern, and considerably more common usage: in the early Baroque the word meant vocal music accompanied by instruments, specifically in concertato style. The concertato style was brought north across the Alps by composers such as Hans Leo Hassler and Heinrich Sch√ºtz, who studied in Venice with the originators of the style, the Venetian School composers including Giovanni Gabrieli. Hassler, Sch√ºtz and others then applied their newly learned techniques to the German chorale to create a form roughly equivalent in expression and purpose to the motet which in the preceding Renaissance era was used in Roman Catholic context. The Protestant Reformation made necessary the development of new genres of music, most of which were related in form and function to equivalent genres in Roman Catholic parts of Europe, but which avoided the use of Gregorian Chant, using the chorale instead (many chorale tunes of which were derived directly from chant, but fitted with words in German). A chorale concerto is a sacred concerto based on a Lutheran chorale. There were two basic types of chorale concerto: # A simple composition for voice and basso continuo, sometimes with an obbligato solo instrument; # A more elaborate polychoral setting, directly related to the music of the Venetian School, and often modeled after the work of Giovanni Gabrieli. The chorale cantata, culminating in the works of J.S. Bach, evolved out of the chorale concerto, and became a popular liturgical form in Germany for more than a hundred years. Composers Composers of chorale concertos included: *Samuel Scheidt *Johann Hermann Schein *Michael Praetorius References Sources   Manfred Bukofzer, Music in the Baroque Era. New York, W.W.

He worked as a freelance journalist until 1941 when he joined the Canadian Army and served during the Second World War. Upon returning to Canada in 1947, he became a paid organizer for the Communist Party's successor, the Labor-Progressive Party. Following the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the accusations by Nikita Khrushchev of crimes by Joseph Stalin, and the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary, Laxer joined many other disillusioned Communists in resigning from the party. He returned to school and ultimately obtained a doctorate in clinical and learning psychology from the University of Toronto. From 1960 to 1964, he was a lecturer in the University of Toronto's department of psychology and a clinical psychologist at Toronto General Hospital. He then taught at York University, and later became an associate professor at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education and became a full professor in 1968. In 1969, he joined his son, James Laxer, and Mel Watkins to form the Waffle, a socialist group within the New Democratic Party. Through the 1970s, he wrote numerous articles and books advocating Canadian economic independence from the United Stateshttp://www.socialisthistory.ca/Docs/History/IS-Origins.htm and, in particular, Canadian ownership of the oil industry. He was appointed by Pierre Trudeau to the board of directors of Petro-Canada which had been created as a state-owned crown corporation, in part, due to Laxer's arguments. In the 1980s, Laxer was active in the Council of Canadians, the peace movement, and as an opponent of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States Free Trade Agreement.

Hardy palms are any of the species of palm (Arecaceae) that are able to withstand brief periods of colder temperatures and even occasional snowfall. A few palms are native to higher elevations of south Asia where true winter conditions occur, while a few others are native to the warmer parts of the temperate zone in North America. A few of these temperate climate palms can tolerate hard freezes with little or no damage. Many of these \\"hardy \\" species can be cultivated in warmer parts of temperate climates. The cold hardiness of palms varies by species. The hardiest species are found in the tribe Trachycarpeae, Washingtonia, and Rhapis, with species which are found in the wild in areas where the mean temperature of the coldest month of the year is not much less that , and Trachycarpus, with species which are found in the wild in areas where the mean temperature of the coldest month of the year is as low as . Members of the above palms and other genera are sometimes grown in areas where they are not truly hardy, overwintering with the aid of various kinds of artificial protection. Fan palms The fan palms (Arecaceae tribe Corypheae; palms with fan-shaped leaves) include all of the hardiest palms. *Windmill Palms (Trachycarpus fortunei, T. takil) ‚Äì is considered the most cold hardy palm in the world. These tough species are native to eastern China and the Himalaya mountains where severe (though brief) winter conditions occur. Hardy to about , they grow at high altitudes where temperatures are cool. It is also tolerant of low summer temperatures. Mature Trachycarpus trees have been successfully grown in high latitude locations as far north as 58¬∞N in northern Scotland. Mature specimens can also be found in the southern coast of Ireland, the southern coast of England, southwestern Canada (in the city of Vancouver and on Vancouver Island), Southern Switzerland (Ticino). Trachycarpus is also grown extensively in Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. In the United States Trachycarpus is cultivated along the Pacific coast and as far north as Washington State and along the Atlantic coast as far north as southern Connecticut. Large mature specimens can be found from Maryland south to Georgia, though numbers decline toward southern Georgia south toward Florida. Across the interior of the United States, there are reports of long term specimens that have survived north to the Ohio River, with several long term plantings in the higher elevations of Tennessee and western North Carolina. It is rated as winter hardy to USDA zone 7. It appears that areas west of the Mississippi River (the southern Plains) may be too hot in summer for successful long term cultivation. *Bismarck Palm (Bismarckia nobilis) - Native to the island of Madagascar off the east coast of Africa this cold hardy palm is among the most sought after palms in Florida mainly due to its unique grey color and ability to withstand temperatures down to 15 f. This palm thrives in any sub-tropical environment. You will see this palm tree in states such as: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and Texas. It is a very fast growing palm, and can go from 3 to 15 feet in just 5 years in the right environment. During late spring the tree will produce small, fragrant flowers. Once fully matured, it can reach heights of up to 70 feet in the wild, however most do not exceed 40 feet. This palm produces sharp thorns on the frond stalks, so one must take proper precautions while pruning. *Mediterranean Fan Palm (Chamaerops humilis) ‚Äì The only palm native to southern Europe besides the Cretan Date Palm, and very drought-tolerant. Hardy to , but does prefer hot summers. Despite the fact that this palm is less hardy than many palms listed here, it has the northernmost native habitat. It is rated as winter hardy to USDA zone 8. It is found in abundance across most of southwestern Europe and northwestern Africa. It is a very slow-growing plant. The blue form of the species, native to high elevations of the Atlas Mountains, has recently been introduced into the trade and early reports indicate that it may be or more degrees hardier than the green form. *Needle Palm (Rhapidophyllum hystrix) ‚Äì This clustering and usually trunkless palm is native to the subtropical southeastern United States, from central Florida to Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Alabama in the United States. It is considered hardy to -23.3 C (-10 F), and is cultivated along the East Coast from Florida to southern Massachusetts, and along the West Coast from California to Seattle. They have proven hardy in the Tennessee valley region and up into the lower Ohio Valley. The needle palm is very slow-growing and rarely reaches heights of over , though very old specimens in the deep south can reach in height and width. There are documented specimens that have been growing in White County, Tennessee, since the early part of the 1960s, as well as United States National Arboretum in the Asia Valley section, in the city of Washington D.C., that are at in height. Serenoa repens *Mazari Palm (Nannorrhops richtiana) ‚Äì This palm, native to the dry, mountainous terrains of northern Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and surrounding regions, is also thought to be extremely cold hardy (perhaps to about ), though also requiring hot summers and dry soils. However, due to its limited availability in cultivation, not much is known about this palm. Mazari Palm is not easy to grow, perfect drainage and full sun are required for this palm to survive. This palm will not tolerate wet freezes. *Saw Palmetto (Serenoa repens) - These palms are native to the southeastern United States, most commonly along the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal plains, but also as far inland as southern Arkansas, this bushy palm is hardy to about . This bushy palm grows in abundance within wetlands and subtropical grasslands of central and northern Florida. Extract from Saw Palmetto is often used to treat problems with the prostate. *Sabal palms (palmettos; 13 species) ‚Äì These palms are native to the southeastern United States, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. The Cabbage Palmetto (Sabal palmetto), the state tree of both Florida and South Carolina, and is widely cultivated along the south Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coast of the United States, and needs hot and humid summers to grow. The species is considered hardy to USDA Hardiness Zone 8, and may survive short periods of temperatures as low as . Large and older specimens can be found from southern Virginia south to Florida and west to Texas. There are a few documented smaller specimens of Sabal palmetto {cabbage palm} growing in zone 7b in southern Maryland, Delaware, and coastal Connecticut in the city of Bridgeport. . The Mexican Palmetto (Sabal mexicana) is a close relative of the Cabbage Palmetto, native to southern Texas and northern Mexico. *Dwarf Palmetto (S. minor) is considered hardy to USDA zone 6b, like the needle palm. It can tolerate short periods of temperatures as low as . Endemic to the swamps and lowlands of the south Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coast of the United States, it can stand long periods of heat and drought. Sabal minor is successfully cultivated across the entire southern United States below 35 latitude, and up the East Coast to 41 latitude and up the West Coast to 45 latitude. *Caranday palm (Trithrinax campestris) is a South American arecaceae palm native of Uruguayan and northeastern Argentine sabanas. It is a very rustic palm that grows in arid, well drained, rocky soils. Its distinctive features are its compact shape, short green to grayish foliage, and trunk fully hidden by dry dead branches (coat) remaining from several previous seasons. It is very resistant to drought, and -9 ¬∞C/-15 ¬∞C temperatures when not in growing season, although it tends to shed its leaves in these conditions. It is one of the most cold-hardy palms in the world, because it also grows in the mountains of Sierras de C√≥rdoba. *Washingtonia palms (Washingtonia filifera, W. robusta) ‚Äì These palms are native to southern California and northwest Mexico, growing as high as in their native habitat. California Washingtonia (W. filifera) is hardy to ; it prefers a dry Mediterranean climate, though it still grows in areas with humid subtropical climates like Brisbane, Sydney, Houston, and New Orleans. It is sometimes grown in containers, or planted as short-term specimens in areas where it is not quite hardy. Mexican Washingtonia (W. robusta) is somewhat less hardy, native to northern Mexico (Baja California Peninsula). It has a more robust trunk and stiffer leaves than W. filifera, and is hardy to . *Livistona australis ‚Äì It is native to southeastern Australia. *Rhapis excelsa ‚Äì It is native to China and it is hardy to about . Pinnate-leaved palms Few palms with pinnate leaves tolerate much frost. They belong to several tribes of the Arecaceae, with the species listed here belonging to Tribe Areceae (Chamaedorea), Tribe Cocoseae (Butia, Jubaea) and Tribe Phoeniceae (Phoenix). Jubaea chilensis in France *Chilean Wine Palm (Jubaea chilensis) ‚Äì A contender for the hardiest pinnate-leaved palm, it is hardy to about and has been cultivated successfully as far north as Seattle, Washington, Vancouver, British Columbia, and London England. This palm does not perform well in hot, humid tropical climates. *Butia Palm or Jelly Palm / Pindo Palm (Butia odorata (syn. B. capitata Hort.)) ‚Äì With Jubaea, possibly the hardiest known pinnate- leaved palm. B. odorata is a palm native to Brazil and Uruguay. This palm grows up to , exceptionally , in a slow but steady manner. It is easily identifiable with beautiful pinnate leaves that arch outwards from a thick stout trunk. B. odorata is notable as one of the hardiest feather palms, tolerating temperatures down to about ; it is widely cultivated in warm temperate regions. It is commonly grown on the East Coast of the United States as far north as Virginia Beach, Virginia and Portland and Seattle on the West coast. It thrives in humid subtropical climates. This tree is commonly known as the \\"jelly palm\\" because of the sticky, edible, date-like fruit it produces, which is used in many South American countries to make jelly. *Butia eriospatha - Woolly Jelly Palm - Though it maybe more cold tolerant, in N. America it is not found in cultivation as much as B. ordorata. This maybe due to being native to a remote mountainous region of Southern Brazil, at altitudes of . The weather is more similar to N. America's Pacific Northwest, with wet winters and cool summer days. *Chamaedorea microspadix and Chamaedorea radicalis ‚Äì the hardiest known species in the genus Chamaedorea. Both species come from Mexico and are considered stem hardy to about , although they will lose their leaves at temperatures below about . *Canary Island Date Palm (Phoenix canariensis) ‚Äì This species is hardy to about , and is grown as far north as the south of England (50¬∞N), producing viable seed (in Southsea, Hampshire). In North America mature specimens can be found as far north as Gold Beach, Oregon (42.5¬∫ N) on the West Coast, and Wilmington, North Carolina (35.2 N) on the East Coast. This palm is one of the most commonly grown palms in the world. Well adapted to low humidity and little watering, this palm is used as an ornamental in both Mediterranean climates and desert climates. In more humid climates, these trees will often be seen with sword ferns sprouting just beneath the crown. *Cretan Date Palm (Phoenix theophrasti) ‚Äì Another species of Phoenix which may show similar frost tolerance, native to Crete and southwest Turkey, but has not been adequately tested. *Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera) ‚Äì This relative of the Canary Island date palm, and producer of the edible date, is also hardy to about , but does not tolerate very wet areas. This palm is one of the staple plants of the Middle East for its versatility and edible fruit. *Mule Palm (√ó Butiagrus nabonnandii) ‚Äì Hardy to about . Manmade hybrid between the Butia palm and Queen palm. One of the hardiest feather palms. It combines the hardiness of the Butia palm with the fast-growing, tropical fronds of the Queen palm. Mature specimens are quite rare due to the difficulty in producing this palm and the characteristics and cold tolerance of the palm is variable with each specimen. Many of them resemble coconut palms. *Ceroxylon quindiuense ‚Äì It is native to the Colombian Andes where it is found at above sea level. At this altitude it tolerates occasional frosts for short periods of time. *Ceroxylon alpinum ‚Äì It is native to the Andes *Archontophoenix cunninghamiana ‚Äì It is native to Australia. *Howea forsteriana ‚Äì It is native to Lord Howe Island in Australia. *Rhopalostylis sapida ‚Äì It is native to New Zealand. It is southernmost palm in the world found as far south as 44¬∞S. *Caryota species ‚Äì They are generally considered tolerant to occasional frosts. *Dypsis decipiens ‚Äì It is native to Madagascar. Plants referred to as palms Some plants used in subtropical landscaping in temperate climates like much of Europe, northern China/Japan, Korea, the northern USA, New Zealand, etc. that are commonly referred to as \\"palms\\", but are not palms, i.e. not members of the Arecaceae family, include: yuccas, Aloidendron barberae, Cordyline australis, Cordyline indivisa, Cycas revoluta, Macrozamia communis, Macrozamia johnsonii, Macrozamia riedlei, Cyathea australis, Cyathea capensis, Cyathea cooperi, Cyathea dealbata, Cyathea medullaris, Dicksonia antarctica, Dicksonia squarrosa, Pseudopanax ferox, and occasionally the sumac Rhus typhina. Hardiness In general, hardy palms can only tolerate brief periods with temperatures in the range . As such, this generally limits hardy palm cultivation and long term specimens to zone 7a or higher. Some hardy palms can be cultivated in areas with low temperatures slightly below this range when given wind sheltering (planted on the south side of a building). In the US, hardy palm cultivation is generally attempted from USDA zones 6b/7a southward. In very cold winter areas below zone 6b, cold hardy palms have been cultivated by partially (or completely) covering plants with mini-green house coverings and wraps. Some garden enthusiasts in severe cold winter areas have gone as far as heating the interiors of these winter enclosures. As such, there are occasional reports of hardy palms be cultivated in areas with severe winters with low temperatures below .

The park first opened in 1979 with the first two waterslides in the state of Colorado (The Bonzai Pipeline). Water World is generally open from Memorial Day through Labor Day, but may be closed some school days. The park occupies , making it one of America's largest water theme parks. , the park has 49 attractions including a multitude of water slides, a \\"lazy river\\" (a circular artificial river with a slow moving current), inflatable tube rides, multi-guest inflatable raft rides, and a water-themed fun house which offers gondola access from the top of the park. The park has two wave pools: the new Cowbunga beach boogie boarding attraction, as well as the older Thunder Bay wave pool. Water attractions The park has several unique water attractions. One of the most notable is the \\"Screamin' Mimi,\\" a ride where guests ride board-type vehicles down a roller coaster like track, reaching speeds of before landing in a pool and bouncing across the water. The \\"Space Bowl\\" sends riders down an enclosed body slide before entering an enclosed circular bowl and dropping out into a pool of water. A similar attraction, \\"Revolution,\\" uses four-person swim rings instead. Also notable is a pitch black swim ring slide, \\"Storm,\\" which includes lighting and sound effects. \\"Turbo Racer\\" opened in 2007 and is a racing slide attraction which features eight side by side lanes and a timed open air finish. Water World's most famous attraction is a raft water slide that takes place completely inside. It is called \\"Voyage to the Center of the Earth,\\" in which riders ride in small circular multi-passenger inflatable rafts and travel through an artificial cavern. It is themed to a newly discovered cave that reportedly has creatures from the prehistoric era still inhabiting it. It includes steep downward spirals, sudden drop offs, and various dinosaurs, including an animatronic Tyrannosaurus encounter at the end of the ride. The ride is unusual for a water park attraction in its thematic emphasis, and in that it can take in excess of 5 minutes to complete, making it one of the longest rides at any water park. Since then, the ride has had two cosmetic upgrades, the most recent in the 2011 season. The Ride has a throughput capacity of over 1,000 guests per hour. Water World has two wave pools. The first one is Captain Jacks, which is located at the upper end of the park. Being the smaller of the two wave pools, Captain Jacks holds roughly 500,000 gallons of water. It uses a repeating engine to create multiple waves on 10-minute cycles. The other is Thunder Bay, the larger pool at the center of the park holding 1.1 million gallons of water. Thunder Bay sports a new engine that generates multiple wave types. The only wave cycle available for guests simulates medium ocean waves creating crashing waves and strong currents in certain areas of the pool. Both wave pools have a maximum depth of 8ft and have multiple points of emergency shut-offs or, \\"E-Stops\\" used to immediately cut engine power from the wave rooms for added guest safety. The newest area of the park is the Big Top, located adjacent to Turbo Racer. Big Top is family oriented and features attractions for younger children as well as thrill seekers. In 2012, Water World announced the Mile High Flyer which is the park's first hydro-magnetic water coaster which launches riders up and down 5 unique hills taking only 45 seconds to complete. The park was included on a 2008 Travel Channel list of the top 10 water parks in the United States.  Pop culture reference  Water World was featured on the South Park Episode \\"Pee!\\" portrayed as a water park named \\"Pipi's Waterpark.\\" Many of the water parks rides appeared in the episode under slightly different names, including its most notable attraction \\"Voyage to the Center of the Earth\\" (retitled \\"Journey to the Center of the World\\"). The Park was also featured heavily in the 2006 feature film, \\"The Surfer King\\" starring Gabriel Iglesias, Alan Thicke, and Lindsay Wagner.  Technology  Water World offers visitors a cashless payment option via RFID wristbands that can be preloaded with money at any POS terminal in the park. Season Passes (Splash Passes) can be upgraded to include a preloaded RFID cashless payment option. Water World also offers lockers that can be accessed via RFID wristbands. The wristbands are dispensed via a self-service kiosk located in Water World's locker rental area. Unlike traditional single use lockers, the RFID wristbands allow users to access the locker multiple times throughout the day. Incidents and accidents In 2009, a lifeguard pulled a 48-year-old man from Captain Jack's Wave Pool. Paramedics were unable to revive him. He was transported to the hospital and pronounced dead, with preliminary reports identifying drowning as the cause of death. This marked the first fatality in the park's history.

After I'd gotten the cheque I told them 'I can‚Äôt come to Wardour Street next week, I have to be in Paris.' I told them to bring their little tape-recorder and meet me at the Georges Cinq Hotel next Wednesday at eleven am. So they flew over to Paris, came to the hotel at eleven ‚Äì and were told that I had checked out the day before.\\" He chortled happily. \\"I left them a message telling them to call me at the Gritti Palace in Venice. They did, and I told them to meet me there on Friday. When they got there I was gone ‚Äì they found a message telling them to come to Vienna.\\" Now he was laughing uproariously. \\"I made them chase me all around Europe with their shitty little tape recorder for ten days. They were sorry they made me audition.\\" It is therefore possible that Welles recorded the session in Vienna, during the making of the Vienna segment of his unfinished Orson's Bag TV special. Lynn‚Äôs second-hand story may be a recollection from the initial recording session with perhaps the same client (we hear the director refer to a previous successful session). Also, the outtakes give many clues that they took place in a professional recording studio and not a hotel using a portable recorder. This also would better explain the client-mandated audition. The BFI database also lists four more 1970 Findus advertisements with place names: \\"France\\", \\"Highlands\\", \\"Normandy and \\"Shetland\\". These may be part of the same series, and possibly also voiced by Welles. It is not known whether a complete recording of the session exists (since, for example, the \\"multiple takes\\" Welles alludes to are not contained on the circulated recording, and the recording transitions between different commercials). It is also not known whether film copies of the final advertisements exist in the BFI National Archive. Summary The recording begins with Welles reading the introduction to a script for a commercial for frozen peas. > \\"We know a remote farm in Lincolnshire, where Mrs. Buckley lives; every > July, peas grow there...\\" Welles breaks from the script, expressing his dissatisfaction about the timing of the piece, as well as remarking that \\"it's so nice that you see a snow- covered field and say, \\"Every July, peas grow there\\"...we're talking about 'em growing and she's picked 'em.\\" A director requests that he emphasize the word 'in' in the phrase \\"in July;\\" Welles claims this is impossible to do in a sensible fashion, claiming that the director isn't thinking. > Why? That doesn't make any sense. Sorry. There's no known way of saying an > English sentence in which you begin a sentence with 'in' and emphasize it. > Get me a jury and show me how you can say \\"in July\\", and I'll go down on > you. That's just idiotic, if you'll forgive me my saying so. That's just > stupid, \\"in July\\"; I'd love to know how you emphasize 'in' in \\"In > July\\"...impossible! Meaningless! A director apologizes because the script actually said \\"Every July\\" rather than \\"in July\\", but Welles continues to complain that it was the other director who made the suggestion, and quips, \\"Too much directing around here.\\" From here, the recording transitions to a different commercial for fish fingers, apparently at either the same recording session, or for the same director: > \\"We know a certain fjord in Norway, near where the cod gather in great > shoals. There, Jan St...\\" Welles struggles with the pronunciation of the fisherman's name, cursing under his breath. The director requests a different pacing, but Welles refuses. > You don't know what I'm up against: because it's full of, of, of things that > are only correct because they're grammatical but they're tough on the ear, > you see; this is a very wearying one, it's unpleasant to read. Unrewarding. Welles attempts to finish the script but gets tangled around the words \\"crumb- crisp coating.\\" The directors permit him to remove the word \\"crumb.\\" The recording moves on to yet another advertisement, for hamburgers, but not before Welles slips in a complaint. > Here, under protest, is \\"beef burgers.\\" \\"We know a little place in the > American far west, where Charlie Briggs chops up the finest prairie-fed beef > and tastes...\\" This is a lot of shit, you know that? The directors ask for one more take, as they don't like the way he emphasizes \\"prairie-fed\\" over beef. > But you can't emphasize 'beef', that's like his wanting me to emphasize 'in' > before 'July'! Come on, fellas, you're losing your heads! I wouldn't direct > any living actor like this in Shakespeare, the way you do this! It's > impossible! The directors try to calm him down, but Welles insists he's giving it the right reading, to which a director responds, \\"For the moment.\\" Welles continues to gripe about the number of takes he's made for these commercials, which he claims is twenty more than any other he's made. > You're such pests...now, what is it you want? In your depths of your > ignorance, what is it you want? Well, whatever it is you want, I can't > deliver because I just don't see it. When the engineer attempts to give Welles some pointers, the actor reveals his frustration of being a performer, a \\"hired hand\\" on the commercial being given conflicting advice from different people in the booth. > I take direction from one person...under protest, but from two I don't sit > still. The actual director continues to try to calm Welles down, but he storms out of the recording booth. > This isn't worth it, no money is worth it! Parodies The tape has been parodied many times, often used in conjunction when parodying Welles. The most notable parody is from animated series Animaniacs; an entire cartoon featuring Pinky and the Brain was titled \\"Yes, Always\\" and featured a near-verbatim staging of the entire scene (all profanities replaced by family-friendly material, e.g., \\"...and I'll make cheese for you\\" in place of \\"...and I'll go down on you\\"), with Brain playing the part of Welles and Pinky as the director. This sketch can be found on the Animaniacs Volume 3 DVD collection. Brain's voice actor, Maurice LaMarche, well known for his Welles impression, is known to parody the \\"frozen peas\\" tape before recording sessions as a warm up; his parody can be heard in the special features of Comic Book: The Movie. Another version portrayed in The Critic features Welles, also voiced by LaMarche, whispering \\"Rosebud\\" √† la Citizen Kane before the shot pans out to reveal Welles at a table, with a plate of Rosebud Frozen Peas he is advertising. After reading his lines, describing the peas as \\"full of country goodness and green pea-ness,\\" he becomes disgusted and walks off, taking a handful of peas with him and eating them alongside a French fry stuck in his beard. In another episode, Welles is upset over having to read a living will, and begins making endorsements for \\"Mrs. Pell's Fish Sticks\\" instead, eating them and declaring that \\"they're even better raw\\". He even appears later as a ghostly apparition to Margo Sherman to continue promoting and eating the fish sticks, declaring that \\"they're even better when you're dead\\". Another parody of the tape appeared in a skit on the Canadian television sketch comedy show SCTV, where Welles, played by John Candy, is hired by Liberace, played by Dave Thomas, for a Christmas storytelling. Welles is frequently distracted by the TV crew and finally, he gets up and walks off (taking an entire roast turkey with him), quoting \\"You people are pests! No money is worth...!\\" Yet another animated example portrayed by LaMarche comes from the 2010 Futurama episode \\"Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences\\" for which he won an Emmy Award. Welles (as a head in a jar) agrees to recreate his famous War of the Worlds broadcast for Lrrr, the Planet Express crew and a cheese log even when complaining on-air about obvious plot holes in the script. The tape was referenced in the \\"Bishop\\" skit from Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album, where it is mentioned that \\"Bath and Wells\\" is busy \\"doing frozen peas for Nigel.\\" Will Ferrell's bookend segments in the miniseries The Spoils of Babylon, as Eric Jonrosh (a Welles lookalike), feature Jonrosh breaking from the script frequently to complain of inane language and berate the unseen crew. Other media The experimental music group Negativland incorporated \\"frozen peas\\" in its entirety in the track \\"Jolly Green Giant\\", a collage also featuring sound effects and other archival recordings of commercials in production phase. The track appears on their 1998 EP Happy Heroes. California punk band Swingin' Utters released an album in 2011 entitled Here, Under Protest, and opens with a clip of Welles saying, \\"Here, under protest, is beef burgers\\".

Established by Mike Fine and Mike Shalett in 1991, data is collected weekly and made available every Sunday (for albums sales) and every Monday (for songs sales) to subscribers, which include record companies, publishing firms, music retailers, independent promoters, film and TV companies, and artist managers. It is the source of sales information for the Billboard music charts. The company operates the analytics platform Music Connect, Broadcast Data Systems (which tracks airplay of music), and Music 360.  History  Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data for Nielsen on March 1, 1991. The May 25 issue of Billboard published Billboard 200 and Country Album charts based on SoundScan \\"piece count data,\\"S. Craig Watkins, Hip Hop Matters: Politics, Pop Culture, and the Struggle for the Soul of a Movement, Beacon Press, August 15, 2006, and the first Hot 100 chart to debut with the system was released on November 30, 1991. Previously, Billboard tracked sales by calling stores across the U.S. and asking about sales‚Äîa method that was inherently error-prone and open to outright fraud. Indeed, while transitioning from the calling to tracking methods, the airplay and sales charts (already monitored by Nielsen) and the Hot 100 (then still using the calling system) often did not match (for instance Paula Abdul's \\"Promise of a New Day\\" and Roxette's \\"Fading Like a Flower\\" reached much higher Hot 100 peaks than their actual sales and airplay would have allowed them to). Although most record company executives conceded that the new method was far more accurate than the old, the chart's volatility and its geographical balance initially caused deep concern, before the change and the market shifts it brought about were accepted across the industry. Tower Records, the country's second-largest retail chain, was originally not included in the sample because its stores are equipped with different technology to measure sales. At first, some industry executives complained that the new system‚Äîwhich relied on high-tech sales measurement rather than store employee estimates‚Äîwas based on an inadequate sample, one that favored established and mainstream acts over newcomers. The Recording Industry Association of America also tracks sales (or more specifically, shipments minus potential returns) on a long-term basis through the RIAA certification system; it has never used either Nielsen SoundScan or the store-calling method. The first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song via Nielsen SoundScan was \\"Set Adrift on Memory Bliss\\" by P.M. Dawn. Other changes would also largely impact the Hot 100 in the future, consisting of radio-only songs being able to chart in 1998, and YouTube views playing part of how a Hot 100 is decided in 2013. In December 2019, Valence Media, the current parent company of Billboard, acquired Nielsen's music data business, reuniting it with Billboard for the first time since its spin-off to E5 Global Media from Nielsen Business Media. Tracking Sales data from cash registers is collected from 14,000 retail, mass merchant, and non-traditional (on-line stores, venues, digital music services, etc.) outlets in the United States, Canada, UK and Japan. The requirements for reporting sales to Nielsen Music are that the store has Internet access and a point of sale (POS) inventory system. Submission of sales data must be in the form of a text file consisting of all the UPCs sold and the quantities per UPC on a weekly basis. Sales collected from Monday-Sunday or Sunday-Saturday are reported every Monday and made available to subscribers every Wednesday. Anyone selling a music product with its own UPC or ISRC may register that product to be tracked by Nielsen Music. Sales calculation Because not all retailers participate in the SoundScan program, to estimate the total CD sales from the data samples obtained, SoundScan employs a calculation method called \\" _weighting_ \\". This consists of assigning to a given category of store outlets a multiplying factor, to compensate for the amount of similar stores considered as not being covered by the sampling program and thus left unrepresented. Sales made at each stores would then be multiplied accordingly. Such system had however been long known and vulnerable to potential exploitation by artists, in order to inflate their recorded chart sales. Some indie labels were reported to purposefully target stores where such \\"weighted\\" value is higher for their on- site sales promotions. Likewise, other labels were found shipping boxes of their CDs to independent retailers to have them scanned there. Impact The incorporation of SoundScan tracking by the Billboard charting system was noted by the industry as being a possible cause of the early '90s popularization of alternative music in the United States; an explanation floated was that the previous call system provided data that under-represented marginal genres. Under SoundScan, exact data about alternative music sales allowed these acts to appear higher in the Billboard charts than before, and this chart success fed back into increasing the genre's perceived popularity in popular culture. In addition, SoundScan data quickly found use in the promotion departments at major record labels, as a way to use sales data to persuade radio station music directors to add tracks by high-selling alternative artists such as Nirvana.

The phrase is abbreviated LEDES and is usually pronounced as \\"leeds\\". The LEDES specifications are maintained by the LEDES Oversight Committee (LOC), which was formed by the Law Firm and Law Department Services Group within PricewaterhouseCoopers. Members of the committee have included law firms, corporate legal departments, universities, and software vendors. The LOC was first informally created in 1995 to address e-billing issues and then incorporated as a California mutual-benefit nonprofit corporation in 2000. The LOC currently maintains four sets of data elements and four data exchange format types. The four sets of data elements are: activity codes; expense codes; timekeeper classification codes; and Uniform Task-Based Management System codes. The four data exchange format types are: electronic billing (e-billing); budgeting; timekeeper attributes; and intellectual property matter management. The LOC recently announced a business partnership with LSG, a legal billing software provider. The two organizations will work together to create web-based content to aid law firms, vendors and corporate clients in the electronic billing process. Electronic billing formats The electronic billing data exchange format types provide a standard data format for electronically transmitted invoices, typically from a law firm to a corporate client. The LEDES e-billing format currently has the following variations: * LEDES 1998, the first \\"LEDES\\" format, created in 1998, but no longer in use. * LEDES 1998B, a pipe-delimited plain text file. The standard was adopted in 1998, and it is by far the more commonly used LEDES format. It lacks some flexibility, having a rigid structure. Another disadvantage of LEDES 1998B is that invoice-level data is repeated on every line item even though it is only needed once, as it does not vary per line. Many clients attempt to impose nonstandard customizations, thus defeating the purpose of having a standard. Nonetheless, law firms prefer it for its simplicity and familiarity. * LEDES XML2000, adopted in 2000, is an XML format. Adoption was slow, but is now fairly widespread. One advantage of LEDES 2000 is that although the structure is well defined, the specification defines \\"extend\\" segments, allowing the insertion of client-specific fields without breaking the format or violating the standard. * LEDES 1998BI (international), a pipe- delimited plain text file, based on the LEDES 1998B standard. This format was designed to accommodate legal bills generated outside of the United States. It includes all of the fields in the LEDES 1998B format, plus additional ones. The format was proposed in 2004 by the Legal IT Innovators Group (LITIG). The LEDES Oversight Committee (LOC) ratified the format in 2006. *LEDES XML2.0, ratified in 2006 and addresses international needs in XML format. Contains 15 segments and 153 data elements. *LEDES XML2.1, ratified in 2008. Contains 16 segments and 191 data elements. Other data exchange formats The other LEDES data exchange formats are as follows: *LEDES Budget was ratified in 2006. This XML format facilitates the exchange of budget data between law firms and clients. *LEDES Timekeeper Attribute was ratified in 2007 and revised in 2014. This XML format used to transmit timekeeper and rate data to from law firms to clients. *IPMM Invention Disclosure Standard was ratified in 2015. This is a set of XML schemas that can validate an XML document containing invention disclosure data. UTBMS In April 2006, the UTBMS Update Initiative voted to merge into the LEDES Oversight Committee. The Uniform Task-Based Management System is a widely used system for coding legal work.

There is a complex history underlying the United States and its relationship with its disabled population, with great progress being made in the last century to improve the livelihood of disabled citizens through legislation providing protections and benefits. Most notably, the Americans with Disabilities Act is a comprehensive anti-discrimination policy that works to protect Americans with disabilities in public settings and the workplace. Despite great progress being made, disabled citizens today face ableism with respect to employment, education, and healthcare in addition to other facets of life as well. For instance, most rural areas ‚Äî especially in the Great Plains region ‚Äî have little or no government-organized medical support infrastructure for the permanently disabled indigent population which results in disability in the United States not only affecting individuals physically and mentally but socioeconomically as well. Annual celebration of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Demographics According to the Disability Status: 2019 - Census 2019 Brief approximately 20% of Americans have one or more diagnosed psychological or physical disability: > Census 2000 counted 49.7 million people with some type of long lasting > condition or disability. They represented 19.3 percent of the 257.2 million > people who were aged 5 and older in the civilian non-institutionalized > population -- or nearly one person in five...\\" This percentage varies depending on how disabilities are defined. It may be helpful to note that disability in the United States is classified under different types of physical or mental impairments of which include one's ability to physically function, mental status, including decision skills and memory, the ability of sight, if they are self-sufficient, and finally, if they depend on any one to help them do tasks . According to Census Brief 97-5, \\"About 1 in 5 Americans have some kind of disability, and 1 in 10 have a severe disability. Not only does this statistic affect those who are disabled, but individuals with disabilities not only endure disadvantages, but so do their children or possibly grandchildren as they can potentially be left facing health care disadvantages as well as education.\\" The United States Census Bureau is legally charged with developing information on the type and prevalence of disability in the population. Statistics reveal the highest percentage of individuals with a disability reside in southern areas such as Texas, Florida, Mississippi, and anywhere along the southern cost. The states that include the fewest disabled individuals are western areas of which will include Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah. These disabled people are also protected not only under one law, but under three. These laws include the Americans with Disabilities Act, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The primary purpose of collecting ACS data on disability is to help the US Congress determine the allocation of federal funds and inform policies. It is also used to identify the characteristics of the disabled population of the United States. Determining the number and geographical location of people with disabilities is crucial for policies aimed at providing services like public transportation. ACS does not directly measure disability There are other smaller survey studies that provide some insight on disability in the US. While studies like the National Health Interview Survey the Health and Retirement Study, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study are used to infer valuable disability-related health characteristics in the US population. While responses to these items are commonly refer to as \\"disability\\", it could be argued the ‚Äîit uses self- and proxy-reports to evaluate perceived ability to perform functional tasks. Existing publications have delineated details on the US population regarding disability by using information from the ACS. Publications have also outlined issues with disability data in the ACS. Research on disability continues to improve, and potential remedies are found for current methodological challenges. Because of the uniqueness, regarding federal funding and policy, researchers from various fields (e.g., sociology, epidemiology, and government) make wide use of ACS data to better understand disability in the US. =African Americans= According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the African American community has the highest rate of disability in the United States at 20.8 percent, slightly higher than the overall disability rate of 19.4%. In particular, elderly African American women face a greater likelihood of acquiring disability than their white counterparts. Given these statistics, it can be suggested that African Americans with disabilities experience the most severe underemployment, unemployment, and under education compared to other disability groups. For instance, the 2015 American Community Survey indicates that African Americans who have disabilities live in poverty at a rate of 1.5 to 2 times greater than other racial groups in America. Poverty Investigations on the \\"poverty and disability nexus\\" have consistently shown poverty and disability are correlated for all race-ethnic groups within the United States. Financial stability of people with disabilities would decrease the dependence on governmental support programs. Studies have been done with the U.S. Census Bureau data to examine the high prevalence of disabilities among welfare recipients. Thirteen percent of families with children under the age of 18, who are also receiving welfare benefits, had at least one child with a disability. Families with income below twice the poverty line were 50% more likely to have a child with a disability than those families with higher incomes. Children with disabilities from families with annual household incomes of higher than $50,000 were more likely to attend higher education. Research suggests higher education does impact employment and income opportunities for people with disabilities. It is also noted near equivocal employment opportunities and salaries for people with disabilities to their peers without disabilities. While only one-fifth of people in the United States have at least a four-year college degree, some studies note possessing a four-year degree is the difference between absolute job security and joblessness. Discrimination in employment The US Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires all organizations that receive government funding to provide accessibility programs and services. A more recent law, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which came into effect in 1992, prohibits private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies and labor unions from discriminating against qualified individuals with disabilities in job application procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, job training, or in the terms, conditions and privileges of employment. This includes organizations like retail businesses, movie theaters, and restaurants. They must make reasonable accommodation to people with different needs. Protection is extended to anyone with (A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual, (B) a record of such an impairment, or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment. The second and third criteria are seen as ensuring protection from unjust discrimination based on a perception of risk, just because someone has a record of impairment or appears to have a disability or illness (e.g. features which may be erroneously taken as signs of an illness). Employment protection laws make discrimination against qualified individuals with a disability illegal and may also require provision of reasonable accommodation. Reasonable accommodations includes changes in the physical environment like making facilities more accessible but also include increasing job flexibility like job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules or reassignment to vacant position. Though many hold attitudes that are more enlightened and informed than past years, the word ‚Äúdisability‚Äù carries few positive connotations for most employers. Negative attitudes by employers toward potential employees with disabilities can lead to misunderstanding and discrimination. Social Security Administration The US Social Security Administration (SSA), defines disability in terms of an individual's inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA), by which it means ‚Äúwork paying minimum wage or better‚Äù. The agency pairs SGA with a list of medical conditions that qualify individuals for disability benefits. Individuals who are disabled will receive insurance and this ensures they will always be getting paid when they must take time off work or cannot work due to the severity of their illness. The SSDI and the SSI are both social security programs that will assist in payments. The SSA makes available to disabled Americans two forms of disability benefits: Social Security Disability Insurance, (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Briefly, the SSDI is a program that is useful in the sense that it is like welfare, but you must have been able to work enough hours throughout your life and you must have paid social security taxes in order to be approved. This benefit is most useful for those who do not have severe disabilities or illnesses because those who are immobile will not have been able to work. The good thing about this benefit is not only does it benefit the individual, but it will benefit their family members as well. To go more in depth, Social Security pays disability benefits to citizens who have worked long enough and have a medical condition that has prevented them from working or is expected to prevent them from working for at least 12 months or end in death. Looking at the SSI, the SSI insurance, or the Social Security Insurance program, is there to pay individual benefits who could not have worked or have little capital. However, for both of these insurances, the same approval is required by the individuals disability. Some assistance ends if the beneficiary starts working. If that assistance (such as personal care or transportation) is necessary for work, it creates a welfare trap where it is not possible to work despite potentially being willing and able. Some programs do provide incentives to work.Work Incentives - General Information Education =K-12= Before the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was passed, children with disabilities were at-risk of not receiving a free, appropriate public education, but each act protecting the disabled individuals protects different criteria of which include differentiation in schools, the law by which schools must be up to date on the K-12 act, and equal service for the public who extend any services. For IDEA to apply, the child must first be determined to be able to benefit from public education. This benefit is not exclusively limited to school-aged children, but applies to children with disabilities from infancy. Due to societal stigma of disability, children are sometimes treated like disabled children, and not included in activities in which other children were able to participate. However, These individuals with any type of disablement such as learning disabilities or physical disabilities, the Americans with Disabilities Act covers them. This act ensures no one is discriminated outside of their own home of which includes work, school, and anywhere in public. The places it does not cover will include sanctioned or private areas including one's home. Educators can hold students with disabilities to lower expectations, which impacts their future educational attainment. Although their future may be impaired the K-12 act is broad amongst education and the Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act will help clarify. This act ensures individuals of whom attended schools, play on school sports teams, or attend any off or on campus events will be protected, unless that school is not funded by the government. These students must be given compromises that other students may not receive due to their impairments. Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the school district must provide every disabled child with an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). The IEP is compiled by a team of school administrators and guardians, and may include a child advocate, counselors, occupational therapists, or other specialists. The Individuals with Disabilities Education act ensures all fees for schooling are discharged, but these children must be approved under IDEA and must be in a certain category of disabilities. This act allows for any student or child to be assessed and are provided extra incentives that may apply to their condition. The IEP also evaluates the goals for the child and determines what needs to be done in order for those goals to be met. Children with disabilities who do not have a parent or guardian advocating on their behalf are not as well served in the education system as their peers with parent or guardian advocates. Transition preparation from K-12 education to post-secondary education or career was initially written into IDEA to begin at age 12, but in the existing law, transition preparation does not begin until age 16. While this law provides a maximum age at which to begin transition preparation, students with disabilities have been known to receive transition preparation at a younger age, as the states might mandate a younger age, or the IEP team might determine a younger age is appropriate to begin the transition preparation of the student. Some students with disabilities have noted not receiving any transition preparation at all. The transition services are to be designed to be results-oriented rather than outcome-oriented. This is to ensure the transition services are designed for the student's success. Students are intended to attend their transition planning meetings with the IEP, yet not all students do. Some do attend, yet generally not take a leadership role - only fourteen percent do. This places the students with a disability in a passive role instead of an agentic role in their own life plans. In a 2007 study of a higher education institution located in the Midwestern United States, it was found that one-third of students with disabilities felt their transition preparation was lacking. Many in this group were unaware of laws that pertained to disability and higher education. This leaves them without an understanding of their learning needs and unable to advocate for themselves. =Higher Education= Self-advocacy plays an important role in the success of students with disabilities in higher education. While examination of self-advocacy skills has been largely limited to the impact in academic settings, self-advocacy skills, or the lack thereof, do also impact non-academic situations. A 2004 study noted only 3 percent of students with disabilities had self-advocacy training. Students with disabilities who are confident about their disability identity and self- advocacy skills are more likely to disclose their disabilities and advocate for their needs when interacting with faculty and staff. Advocacy service is also provided to students as staff from different programs help instructors in college, understand the needs of the disabled who are attending their classes. So much so that when disable students need extra time to complete their course then some arrangements are made to cater such students. Students with disabilities who were embarrassed of their disability identity and did not understand their needs as learners looked to faculty and staff for solutions to accommodation needs. Education helps students with disabilities learn self- advocacy skills that affect their ability to advocate for their health, insurance, and other needs. In spite of IDEA and Section 504 providing support for education of people with disabilities, the educational outcomes of people with disabilities vary significantly from the outcomes of people without disabilities. After high school, a 2005 study found students with disabilities enroll in postsecondary education, whether college, technical school, or vocational school, at a rate of 46% compared to the rate of 63% for students without disabilities. This rate is up 23% since 1990, when the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was passed. Specifically to four-year degree granting higher education institutions, 27% of students with disabilities attend compared to 54% of students without disabilities. High school completion and postsecondary education enrollment vary per disability type. Students with disabilities are responsible for advocating for their accommodations and needs as learners in higher education environments. Many higher education institutions have staff to work with students with disabilities on their accommodation requests. Higher education institutions do vary in process to obtain accommodations and accommodations provided. The staff members at the higher education institutions can recommend accommodations. The faculty members, however, may choose to vary or not implement the accommodations at all based upon concerns of weakening academic integrity of the course or risking the possibility of endless accommodation requests. When working with faculty members about accommodations, nearly half of the students with disabilities recalled receiving a negative response, while the other half felt their faculty members were accommodating. For people with disabilities, having a four-year college degree provides significant employment and salary advantages. =Employment and minimum wage exemption= Disabled citizens in the United States receive Medicare insurance and social security benefits to varying degrees. For those that seek employment for therapeutic or economic reasons, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is applicable. This act was an attempt to facilitate the large number of disabled servicemen returning from the front lines \\"to the extent necessary to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment\\".Fair Labor Standards Act 1938 S14 (c) Section 14(c) provides the employers with a method of paying their disabled employees less than applicable federal minimum wage. The Secretary of Labor issues certificates that align wages with the employee's productivity. At present there are 420,000 ¬ß14(c) employees being paid less than the minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Administratively, the wage for the disabled was informally set at 75%. Those working in sheltered work centers have no minimum floor for their wage. The Fair Wages for Workers with Disabilities Act was proposed in 2013 to repeal ¬ß14(c) but was not passed. Insurance It is illegal for California insurers to refuse to provide car insurance to properly licensed drivers solely because they have a disability. It is also illegal for them to refuse to provide car insurance \\"on the basis that the owner of the motor vehicle to be insured is blind,\\" but they are allowed to exclude coverage for injuries and damages incurred while a blind unlicensed owner is actually operating the vehicle (the law is apparently structured to allow blind people to buy and insure cars which their friends, family, and caretakers can drive for them).

It was for solo voice and accompanying instruments, usually basso continuo, and was closely related to the contemporary Italian style of monody. Almost all examples of chorale monodies were written in the first half of the 17th century. A chorale monody used the text of a chorale, but rarely if ever used the chorale tune, at least not in a recognizable form. It was also related to the concertato madrigal, another contemporary Italian form . While the vocal part in Schein's early examples of the genre retained the rhythmic and melodic flexibility of the Italian monody, he replaced the rhythmically vague bass lines of his model with a stricter rhythmic beat in the instrumental accompaniment.

It lies in the northeast corner of the downtown area. The neighbourhood covers the area bounded by Jarvis Street to the west, Bloor Street East to the north, Parliament Street to the east, and Wellesley Street East to the south. St. James Town is the largest high-rise community in Canada. It has been identified as one of 13 economically deprived neighbourhoods within the city. It consists of 19 high-rise buildings (14 to 32 stories). These residential towers were built in the 1960s. Officially, approximately 17,000 people live in the neighbourhood's 19 apartment towers and 4 low rise buildings, making it one of Canada's most densely populated communities.Fun with the Census: Where‚Äôs the densest place in North America? A majority of the buildings are owned by the Bleeman Family, and were built by Medallion. History St. James Town began to grow in the 19th century when it became a semi-suburban area home to the city's middle class. Many of St. James Town's highrises were originally designed after the Second World War, inspired by Le Corbusier's towers in the park concept. St. James Ward was rezoned in the 1950s, and the nineteenth century homes were leveled, and apartment towers ‚Äî inspired by Le Corbusier's Towers in the Park concept ‚Äî were erected. Each tower was named after a major Canadian city with some accommodating over a 1000 residents. The 14 story Quebec was completed in 1959, the 18 story Victoria in 1965, and The Toronto's 24 floors in 1967. In the same census time period (1961 - 1971) St. James Town's population grew to 11,462 from only 862.\\"Statistics Canada.\\" Government of Canada, Statistics Canada. Web. Accessed 31 Mar. 2014. In the late 1960s, the developers attempted to acquire land south of Wellesley, as far as Carlton Street, to expand the St. James Town development. Many residents of the area resisted, with the support of civic activist and future Mayor of Toronto John Sewell. The St. James Town expansion was cancelled, and the homes that had been demolished were replaced with several housing cooperatives. The plan for St. James Town's highrises was conceived in the 1950s to house young middle class residents who worked downtown. It was spurred forward by the federal government, which saw city building as a key to the nation's recovery after the Depression and the Second World War.Caulfield, Jon. City form and everyday life: Toronto's gentrification and critical social practice. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1994 The buildings failed to attract the large number of demographics the developer envisioned, and the neighbourhood was designed without proper amenities to support the spike in density. Parallel to the development of St. Jamestown was large suburban developments of detached family homes in the Toronto's suburbs. Many prospective tenants instead chose suburban houses in the developing areas of Scarborough, Etobicoke, and North York. After the first generation of tenants left the buildings, the area quickly started attracting tenants of a lower income bracket. Four buildings were later built by the province to provide public housing. The towers are now mostly home to newly arrived immigrant families, with only 33% being born in Canada, according to the 2011 Census. In 2001, a new Toronto Public Library branch and community centre was opened in St. James Town. After the Provincial health care restructuring in the mid 1990s, the Princess Margret Hospital site on Sherbourne Street because available. In 2001, the City of Toronto launched a major initiative to add social amenities in the area and began the construction of a new Toronto Public Library branch and community centre, which opened in 2004 at the corner of Sherbourne and Wellesley. Lanterra Developments has also proposed plans to replace some of the remaining Victorian homes in St. Jamestown with several more towers.Landau, Jack. Lanterra's North St James Town Proposal Resurfaces Urban Toronto. 28 February 2013 On September 24, 2010, a fire broke out on the 24th floor of 200 Wellesley St East (the white building behind the library and community centre). Fourteen people were taken to hospital due to injuries, including three firefighters and two children. Three of the injuries were classed as serious. The cause of the fire was determined to be a cigarette thrown from a balcony above. In 2013, St. James Town became the host of the world's tallest mural, pending approval by Guinness. On August 21, 2018, a fire broke out in an electrical box at 650 Parliament St. Only two people suffered minor injuries, but the entire building, containing 1,500 or more people, had to be evacuated. It took six hours to douse the flames. Reports indicated that evacuees would have to wait \\"several days\\" before they would be allowed to return. As of May 2019, re-occupancy has been postponed to late that year due to the complexities of restoration work, including the discovery of the presence of a \\"minor amount\\" of asbestos. Demographics Census tract 0065.00 of the 2006 Canadian census covers St. James Town. According to that census, the neighbourhood has 14,666 residents. Average income is $22,341, one of the lowest in Toronto. In the 2011 National Household Survey, the average income of residents in Ontario is reported to be $42,264. When compared to the average income of residents in this Census Tract from the 2011 Census year, this is a difference of $19,923. When further examined against the average income of residents in Canada, whereby it is reported to be $40,650 in the 2011 National Household Survey, the difference remains similar at $18,309. Both of these differences therefore shows us the sharp income disparities in this Census Tract and its resulting socio-economic impacts on its residents (Census 2006, Census 2011). In addition, this can be seen in the income distribution of the neighbourhood in 2011 with 57% of the inhabitants earning less than $19,999 and only 6% earning more than $60,000. In fact the majority of individuals (82.6%) over the age of 15 earn an income of less than $39,999 before tax. Due to its cultural and minority demographics, St. James Town is often thought as \\"the world within a block\\". It is largely filled with immigrants ‚Äî especially those who arrived in the 1990s. The ten most common languages in the neighbourhood, after English, are: #Tagalog - 8.1% #Tamil - 5.5% #Unspecified Chinese - 2.5% #Mandarin - 2.5% #Korean - 1.9% #Spanish - 1.8% #Russian - 1.8% #Serbian - 1.4% #Bengali - 1.4% #Urdu - 1.4% The diversity of the neighbourhood can be further supported by the fact that in 2011, 59% of the population identified as an immigrant. An immigrant is one who is citizen of Canada and has moved to Canada from somewhere else. 8% of the population identified as non-permanent residents and 33% identified as non-immigrants.Statistics Canada's 2011 Census of Canada 2012 The disproportional number of renters to owners in this area has been explored on the 2006 and 2011 census and the numbers tell a troubling story about the falling number of property owners in this census Tract area. The data suggest in 2006, 50 people owned one of the limited number of older model properties in the area but by 2011 that number had fallen to 40. This however could be in correlation to the fall in the overall population in the area. Though the area is seeing improvements in terms of access to amenities the population has indeed dropped from 14,666 to 13,910 between census years 2006 and 2011. (census 2006, census 2011) In terms of the 2011 National Household Survey, there was Global Non-Response rate of 21.7% which means that only 25.8% of the population completed the survey. This number is actually higher than the 20% response rate of the 2006 Long Form census, however due to the voluntary nature of the census, the data is not as reliable compared to the mandatory long form census of 2006. This is because when it is a voluntary census rather one required by law, there is a high chance of non-response bias especially as the GNR grows larger which means that there is a higher chance that those who are responding to the voluntary survey is not completely randomized. In comparison to Canada, which has a GNR of 26.1%, and Ontario, which has a GNR of 27.1%, CT5350065.0 has a lower GNR rate which that there may be less of a non-response bias. Generation Status According to the 2006 long form census and the 2011 National Household Survey the majority of individuals in St. James Town (census tract 5350065.00) would be categorized as being of first generation status (Statistics Canada, 2006; Statistics Canada, 2011). First generation status applies to people who were born outside of Canada (Statistics Canada, 2011). Second generation refers to people born in Canada but their mother and father were born outside of Canada (Statistics Canada, 2011). The final category, third generation and more, covers people who were born and Canada and both their mother and father were also born in Canada (Statistics Canada, 2011). The following is a breakdown of the percentages of those considered first, second, and third generation or more in St. James Town in both 2006 and 2011. 2006: First Generation Status: 78% Second Generation Status: 8% Third Generation Status and more: 14% 2011: First Generation Status: 67% Second Generation Status: 20% Third Generation Status and more: 13% From 2006 to 2011 the biggest change in the generation status occurred in the second-generation category where those considered second generation rose 12% from 8% to 20%. This indicates that individuals that were born in Canada with a mother or father born outside of Canada increased from 2006 to 2011. First generation status, on the other hand, decreased (despite still containing the majority of the population both years) and those considered third generation and more decreased by 1%. It can therefore be concluded that the majority of people living in St. James Town were not born in Canada according to both the 2006 long form census (where they accounted for 78% of those who completed the survey) and the 2011 National Household Survey (where they accounted for 67% of those who completed the survey). This information can be related to previously mentioned data on income and immigration status and diversity. In 2006 the long form census had a 20% completion rate compared to the 2011 National Household Survey, which had a 25.85% completion rate. Therefore, more people completed the survey in 2011 compared to 2006, but as previously mentioned, one must be aware of a possibility of a non-response bias, meaning those answering the survey might not be random and may have affected the data. Immigrant Status In 2006, there was a total of 14, 666 residents in St. James Town. Of this population, 14, 606 identified themselves as an immigrant. In 2011 (Global Non-Response Rate: 21.7)* (Statistics Canada, 2006; Statistics Canada, 2011)., the population dropped by 632 people to 13, 974 people (Statistics Canada, 2006; Statistics Canada, 2011). Of this population 8,180 stated that they were immigrants on the census. Although there was not a significant drop in population there was a significant drop of 6, 426 immigrants that no longer live in the area according to the 2006 long census form survey and 2011 National Household Survey (Statistics Canada, 2006; Statistics Canada, 2011).

In a relatively brief but highly productive NFL career, Sayers spent seven seasons with the Chicago Bears from 1965 to 1971, though multiple injuries effectively limited him to five seasons of play. He was known for his elusiveness and agility, and was regarded by his peers as one of the most difficult players to tackle. Nicknamed the \\"Kansas Comet\\", Sayers played college football for the Kansas Jayhawks football team of the University of Kansas, where he compiled 4,020 all-purpose yards over three seasons and was twice recognized as a consensus All-American. In Sayers' rookie NFL season, he set a league record by scoring 22 touchdowns‚Äîincluding a record-tying six in one game‚Äîand gained 2,272 all-purpose yards en route to being named the NFL's Rookie of the Year. He continued this production through his first five seasons, earning four Pro Bowl appearances and five first-team All-Pro selections. A right knee injury forced Sayers to miss the final five games of the 1968 season, but he returned in 1969 to lead the NFL in rushing yards and be named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year. An injury to his left knee in the 1970 preseason as well as subsequent injuries kept him sidelined for most of his final two seasons. His friendship with Bears teammate Brian Piccolo, who died of cancer in 1970, inspired Sayers to write his autobiography, I Am Third, which in turn was the basis for the 1971 made-for- TV movie Brian's Song. Sayers was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977 at age 34, and remains the youngest person to have received the honor. He was named to the NFL's 75th Anniversary Team as a halfback and kick returner, the only player to occupy two positions on the team. For his achievements in college, Sayers was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame the same year. His jersey number is retired by both the Bears and the University of Kansas. Following his NFL career, Sayers began a career in sports administration and business, and served as the athletic director of Southern Illinois University from 1976 to 1981. Early years Gale Eugene Sayers was born to Roger Earl Sayers and Bernice Ross in Wichita, Kansas, and raised in Omaha, Nebraska. His father was a mechanic for Goodyear, farmed, and worked for auto dealerships. Sayers' younger brother, Ron, later played running back for the San Diego Chargers of the American Football League. Roger, his older brother, was a decorated college track and field athlete. Gale graduated from Omaha Central High School, where he starred in football and track and field. A fine all-around track athlete, he set a state long jump record of 24 ft 10 in (7.58m) as a senior in 1961. College career Sayers was recruited by several major Midwestern colleges before deciding to play football at the University of Kansas. While being interviewed during a broadcast of a Chicago Cubs game on September 8, 2010, Sayers said he had originally intended to go to the University of Iowa. Sayers said that he decided against going to Iowa after the Iowa head coach, Jerry Burns, did not have time to meet Sayers during his one campus visit. During his Jayhawks career, he rushed for 2,675 yards and gained a Big Eight Conference-record 4,020 all-purpose yards. He was three times recognized as a first-team All‚ÄìBig Eight selection and was a consensus pick for the College Football All-America Team in both 1963 and 1964. As a sophomore in 1962, his first year on the varsity team, Sayers led the Big Eight Conference and was third in the nation with 1,125 rushing yards. His 7.1 yards-per-carry average was the highest of any player in the NCAA that season. Against Oklahoma State, he carried 21 times for a conference single-game-record 283 yards to lead Kansas to a 36‚Äì17 comeback victory. In 1963, Sayers set an NCAA Division I FBS record with a 99-yard run against Nebraska. He finished the year with 917 rushing yards, again leading all rushers in the Big Eight. He earned first-team All-America recognition from the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA), The Sporting News, and United Press International (UPI), among others. In 1964, his senior year, he led the Jayhawks to a 15‚Äì14 upset victory over Oklahoma with a 93-yard return of the game's opening kickoff for a touchdown. He finished the year with 633 rushing yards, third most among Big Eight rushers, and also caught 17 passes for 178 yards, returned 15 punts for 138 yards, and returned seven kickoffs for 193 yards. He earned first-team All-America honors from each of the same selectors as in the previous year, in addition to the Associated Press (AP), among others. Professional career =1965: Rookie season= Sayers was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the first round, fourth overall, in the 1965 NFL Draft, and was also picked fifth overall by the Kansas City Chiefs of the American Football League in the AFL draft. After consulting his wife, he decided he would rather play in Chicago, signing with George Halas's Bears. In his rookie year, he scored an NFL-record 22 touchdowns: 14 rushing, six receiving, and one each on punt and kickoff returns. He gained 2,272 all-purpose yards, a record for an NFL rookie, with 1,371 of them coming from scrimmage. Sayers averaged 5.2 yards per rush and 17.5 yards per reception. His return averages were 14.9 yards per punt return and a league-high 31.4 yards per kickoff return. Against the Minnesota Vikings on October 17, Sayers carried 13 times for 64 yards and a touchdown; caught four passes for 63 yards and two touchdowns; and had a 98-yard kickoff return touchdown in the 45‚Äì37 Bears victory. He was the last NFL player to score a rushing, receiving, and kickoff return touchdown in the same game until Tyreek Hill accomplished the feat over 50 years later, in 2016. Bears coach Halas lauded Sayers after the game, saying, \\"I don't ever remember seeing a rookie back who was as good,\\" and deemed his talents equal to former Bears greats Red Grange and George McAfee. \\"And remember,\\" said Halas, \\"we used to call George 'One-Play McAfee'.\\" On December 12, Sayers tied Ernie Nevers' and Dub Jones' record for touchdowns in a single game, scoring six in a 61‚Äì20 victory over the San Francisco 49ers that was played in muddy conditions at the Chicago Cubs' Wrigley Field. He accounted for 326 yards in the game: 113 rushing, 89 receiving, and 134 on punt returns. Sayers was the consensus choice for NFL Rookie of the Year honors from the AP, UPI, and NEA. He was quoted as saying at the time: =1966: First rushing title= In his second season, Sayers led the league in rushing with 1,231 yards, averaging 5.4 yards per carry with eight touchdowns, and becoming the first halfback to win the rushing title since 1949.In every season from 1950 to 1965, the annual rushing yards leader was a fullback. He also led the Bears in receiving with 34 catches, 447 yards, and two more touchdowns. He surpassed his rookie season's kick return numbers, averaging 31.2 yards per return with two touchdowns. He also supplanted his all-purpose yards total from the previous season, gaining 2,440 to set the NFL record. The first of his kickoff return touchdowns that season came against the Los Angeles Rams, as he followed a wedge of blockers en route to a 93-yard score. Against the Minnesota Vikings in the Bears' final game of the season, and the first of Sayers' pro career with his parents in attendance, he carried 17 times for a franchise-record 197 yards after returning the opening kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown. Sayers was named to All-Pro first teams by the AP, UPI, the NEA, The Sporting News, and the Pro Football Writers Association, among others. Starring in his second straight Pro Bowl, Sayers carried 11 times for 110 yards and was named the back of the game. The Bears finished the season with a 5‚Äì7‚Äì2 record, and the Chicago Tribune tabbed Sayers as \\"the one bright spot in Chicago's pro football year.\\" Sayers signing autographs in 2005 =1967: Shared workload= In Halas's final season as an NFL coach, Sayers again starred. Sharing more of the rushing duties with other backs, such as Brian Piccolo, Sayers gained 880 yards with a 4.7-yard average per carry. His receptions were down as well. He had three kickoff returns for touchdowns on 16 returns, averaging 37.7 yards per return. Only rarely returning punts‚Äîhe returned three all season‚ÄîSayers still managed to return one for a score against the San Francisco 49ers, a game in which he also returned the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown and scored a rushing touchdown on a rain- soaked field in San Francisco's Kezar Stadium. \\"It was a bad field, but it didn't stop some people,\\" said 49ers coach Jack Christiansen of Sayers' performance. Christiansen said that after Sayers' kickoff return, he ordered that all punts go out of bounds. But Sayers received the punt and ran 58 yards through the middle of the field for the score. In a November game against the Detroit Lions, a cutback by Sayers caused future hall of fame cornerback Lem Barney to fall over, after which Sayers sprinted for a 63-yard gain. Later in the game he returned a kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. After the season, Sayers was chosen for his third straight Pro Bowl, in which he returned a kickoff 75 yards and scored a three-yard rushing touchdown and again earned player of the game honors. Chicago finished in second place in the newly organized Central Division with a 7‚Äì6‚Äì1 record. =1968‚Äì1969: Right knee injury and comeback season= Sayers had the most productive rushing yardage game of his career on November 3, 1968, against the Green Bay Packers, during which he carried 24 times for 205 yards. His season ended prematurely the following week against the 49ers' Kermit Alexander, when he tore several ligaments in his right knee including his anterior cruciate ligament, his medial collateral ligament, and his meniscus cartilage. Garry Lyle, the teammate nearest Sayers at the time, said, \\"I saw his eyes sort of glass over. I heard him holler. I knew he was hurt.\\" Sayers had again been leading the league in rushing yards through the first nine games, and finished the year with 856 yards. After surgery, Sayers went through a physical rehabilitation program with the help of Piccolo, who had replaced him in the starting lineup. Despite missing the Bears' final five games, he earned first-team All-Pro recognition from several media outlets, including the AP, UPI, and NEA. In the 1969 season, after a slow start and despite diminished speed and acceleration, Sayers led the league in rushing once again with 1,032 yards. He averaged 4.4 yards per carry and was the only player to gain over 1,000 rushing yards that year. He moved into second place on the Bears' all-time rushing yards list, passing Bronko Nagurski. Sayers was recognized as the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year by United Press International. The Bears, long past the Halas glory years, finished in last place with a franchise-worst 1‚Äì13 record. In his fourth and final Pro Bowl appearance, Sayers was the West's leading rusher and its leading receiver. For the third time in as many Pro Bowl performances, he was named the \\"Back of the Game\\". =1970‚Äì1971: Left knee injury and retirement= In the 1970 preseason, Sayers suffered a second knee injury, this time bone bruises to his left knee. Attempting to play through the injury in the opening game against the Giants, his production was severely limited. He sat out the next two games and returned in Week 4 against the Vikings, but he was still visibly hampered, most evidently when he was unable to chase down Vikings defensive lineman Alan Page during a 65-yard fumble return. Sayers carried only six times for nine yards before further injuring his knee. He underwent surgery the following week and was deemed out for the remainder of the season. He had carried 23 times for 52 yards to that point. During his off time, Sayers took classes to become a stockbroker and became the first black stockbroker in his company's history. He also entered a Paine Webber program for 45 nationwide stockbroker trainees and placed second highest in sales. After another knee operation and rehabilitation period, Sayers attempted a comeback for the 1971 season. He was kept out of the first three games after carrying the ball only twice in the preseason, as Bears head coach Jim Dooley planned to slowly work him back into the rotation. His first game back was against the New Orleans Saints on October 10, in which he carried eight times for 30 yards. After the game, he told reporters he was satisfied with his performance and that his knee felt fine. The following week, against the 49ers, he carried five times before injuring his ankle in the first quarter, an injury that ultimately caused him to miss the remainder of the season. He was encouraged to retire but decided to give football one last try. Sayers' final game was in the 1972 preseason in which he fumbled twice in three carries; he retired from professional football days later. Playing style Sayers' ability as a runner in the open field was considered unmatched, both during his playing career and since his retirement. He possessed raw speed‚Äîhe completed a 100-yard dash in 9.7 seconds‚Äî and was also highly elusive and had terrific vision, a combination which made him very difficult to tackle. Actor Billy Dee Williams, who portrayed Sayers in the 1971 film Brian's Song, likened his running to \\"ballet\\" and \\"poetry\\". Mike Ditka, a teammate of Sayers' for two seasons, called him \\"the greatest player I've ever seen. That's right‚Äîthe greatest.\\" Another former teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus, famous for his tackling ability, said of Sayers: > He had this ability to go full speed, cut and then go full speed again right > away. I saw it every day in practice. We played live, and you could never > get a clean shot on Gale. Never. On his tendency to escape from tight situations, Sayers once proclaimed, \\"Just give me 18 inches of daylight. That's all I need.\\" He felt if his blockers created 18 inches of space for him to run through, he could break a run into the open field. This quick acceleration became a hallmark of his running style, although some of it was lost following the injury to his right knee. After the injury, he relied more on tough running and engaging tacklers for extra yards. Despite the production from Sayers, the Bears as a whole struggled to find success; in games that Sayers played, the team compiled a record of 29 wins, 36 losses, and 3 ties, and failed to reach the postseason. Because of this, Sayers' main focus each postseason was on the Pro Bowl, where he excelled. Showcasing his breakaway talents, throughout his Pro Bowl career he achieved runs of 74, 52, 51, 48, and 42 yards. In the Pro Bowl following his rookie season, he had kickoff returns of 51 and 48 yards, despite limited opportunities due to the East's attempts to punt and kick away from him. In the next season's game, his 10 yards-per-carry average set a Pro Bowl record. He was named the \\"Back of the Game\\", an honor he received again in 1968 and 1969, joining Johnny Unitas as the only players to win three Pro Bowl MVP awards. \\"The Pro Bowl is the time to prove how good you are, playing against the best of your peers,\\" recalled Sayers. \\"I took it as a challenge. I came into the game in shape, came to play.\\" Brian Piccolo In 1967, Sayers and Bears teammate Brian Piccolo became roommates in the NFL. Sayers' ensuing friendship with Piccolo and Piccolo's struggle with cancer (embryonal cell carcinoma, which was diagnosed after it metastasized to a large tumor in his chest cavity), became the subject of the made-for-TV movie Brian's Song. The movie, in which Sayers was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the 1971 original and by Mekhi Phifer in the 2001 remake, was adapted from Sayers' account of this story in his 1970 autobiography, I Am Third. Sayers and Piccolo were devoted friends and deeply respectful of and affectionate with each other. Piccolo helped Sayers through rehabilitation after injury, and Sayers was by Piccolo's side throughout his illness until his death in June 1970. Later life Sayers speaking to troops in Afghanistan in 2005 =Sports administration and business career= Sayers worked in the athletic department at his alma mater, the University of Kansas, for three and half years, before he was named the athletic director at Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 1976. He resigned from his position at Southern Illinois in 1981. In 1984, Sayers founded Crest Computer Supply Company in the Chicago area. Under Sayers' leadership, this company experienced consistent growth and was renamed Sayers 40, Inc. He was chairman of Sayers 40, Inc., the aforementioned technology consulting and implementation firm serving Fortune 1000 companies nationally with offices in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Walpole, Massachusetts, Clearwater, Florida, and Atlanta. Sayers, along with his wife Ardythe, were also active philanthropists in Chicago. He supported the Cradle Foundation‚Äîan adoption organization in Evanston, Illinois, and founded the Gale Sayers Center in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago. The Gale Sayers Center is an after-school program for children ages 8‚Äì12 from Chicago's west side and focuses on leadership development, tutoring, and mentoring. In 2009, Sayers joined the University of Kansas Athletic Department staff as Director of Fundraising for Special Projects. =Concussion lawsuits= In September 2013, Sayers reportedly sued the NFL, claiming the league negligently handled his repeated head injuries during his career. The lawsuit claimed Sayers suffered headaches and short-term memory loss since retirement. It stated he was sometimes sent back into games after suffering concussions, and that the league did not do enough to protect him. The case was withdrawn after Sayers initially claimed it was done so because the case was filed without his permission, but was actually withdrawn due to other litigation that Sayers was involved in at the time. Sayers filed a new lawsuit in January 2014 along with six other former players. =Legacy and honors= Records Sayers' record of 22 touchdowns in a season was broken by O. J. Simpson in 1975, who scored 23; his 22 touchdowns remains a rookie record as of 2017. Sayers remains the most recent player to score at least six touchdowns in a game. His career kickoff return average of 30.56 yards is an NFL record for players with at least 75 attempts, and he is one of several players to have scored two return touchdowns in a game. He is tied with four other players for the second most career kickoff return touchdowns, with six. Sayers' rookie record of 2,272 all-purpose yards was broken in 1988 by Tim Brown, who gained 2,317 yards through 16 games, which was two more games than Sayers set the record in. His single-season all-purpose yards record of 2,440 set in 1966 was broken in 1974 by Mack Herron, who surpassed it by four yards. Post-career recognition Sayers was elected to the Lincoln Journal's Nebraska Sports Hall of Fame in 1973, the first black athlete to be so honored. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1977. His number 48 jersey is one of three retired by the Kansas Jayhawks football team. Later in 1977, Sayers was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and is still the youngest inductee in its history. On October 31, 1994, at halftime of a Monday night game, the Bears retired his number 40 at Soldier Field, along with number 51, which had been worn by teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus. The Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee named Sayers to its NFL 1960s All- Decade Team, which is composed of the best players of the 1960s at each position. In 1994, Sayers was selected for the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team as both a halfback and a kickoff returner; he was the only player selected for multiple positions. In 1999 he was ranked 22nd on The Sporting News's list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. =Illness and death= In March 2017, Sayers' wife, Ardythe, revealed that he had been diagnosed with dementia four years prior. She stated that a Mayo Clinic doctor confirmed it was likely caused by his football career. \\"It wasn't so much getting hit in the head,\\" she said. \\"It's just the shaking of the brain when they took him down with the force they play the game in.\\" While he remained physically healthy, the disease had an adverse effect on his mental health and memory in particular, making simple tasks such as signing his own name difficult. After suffering from dementia for several years, Sayers died on September 23, 2020, at the age of 77.

He was the first Grand Master of Wad≈ç-ry≈´ karate, and received high awards within Japan for his contributions to karate. Early life ≈åtsuka was born on June 1, 1892, in Shimodate City, Ibaraki, Japan. He was one of four children to Tokujiro ≈åtsuka, a medical doctor. At the age of 5 years, he began training in the martial art of jujutsu under his great-uncle, Chojiro Ebashi (a samurai). ≈åtsuka's father took over his martial arts education in 1897. At the age of 13, ≈åtsuka became the student of Shinzaburo Nakayama in Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ jujutsu. In 1911, while studying business administration at Waseda University in Tokyo, ≈åtsuka trained in various jujutsu schools in the area. Before his studies were complete, his father died and he was unable to continue studying; he commenced work as a clerk at the Kawasaki Bank. Although he wished to become a full-time instructor, he did not pursue this course at this point out of respect for his mother's wishes. Shotokan karate On June 1, 1921 , ≈åtsuka received the menkyo kaiden (certificate of mastery and license to teach) in Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ jujutsu from Nakayama Tatsusaburo. While a valid license, a common misconception is that along with this certificate he became the \\"4th grandmaster\\" of Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´. This is inaccurate - the 3rd grandmaster (Tatsuo Matsuoka) actually outlived ≈åtsuka by almost 8 years. Jujutsu was not to become his primary art, however; in 1922, ≈åtsuka began training in Shotokan karate under Gichin Funakoshi, who was a new arrival in Japan. In 1927, he also established a medical practice and specialized in treating martial arts training injuries. By 1928, ≈åtsuka was an assistant instructor in Funakoshi's school. He also trained under Ch≈çki Motobu and Kenwa Mabuni, and studied kobudo, around this time. ≈åtsuka began to have philosophical disagreements with Funakoshi,Konishi, Y. (1977): Karatedo: Ryukyu Karate no sentatsusha-tachi (Predecessors of Ryukyu Karate) (pp. 58‚Äì59). Japan: Sozou. and the two men parted ways in the early 1930s. This may have come, in part, from his decision to train with Motobu. Funakoshi's karate emphasized kata, a series of movements and techniques linked by the fighting principles. Funakoshi did not believe that sparring was necessary for realistic training. Motobu, however, emphasized the necessity of free application, and created a series of two-person kumite called yakusoku kumite.≈åtsuka, H. (1977): Karatedo: Meisei-juku Zengo (Before and after Meisei-juku) (p. 55). Japan: Sozou. Wado-ryu karate On April 1, 1934, ≈åtsuka opened his own karate school the Dai Nippon Karate Shinko Kai at 63 Banchi Suehiro-Cho, Kanda, Tokyo. He blended Shotokan karate with his knowledge of Shind≈ç Y≈çshin-ry≈´ jujutsu to form Wad≈ç-ry≈´ karate, although the art would only later take on this name several years later. With recognition of his style as an independent karate style, ≈åtsuka became a full-time instructor. In 1940, his style was registered at the Butokukai, Kyoto, for the demonstration of various martial arts, together with Shotokan, Shit≈ç-ry≈´, and G≈çj≈´-ry≈´. Following World War II, the practice of martial arts in Japan was banned. After a few years, however, the ban was lifted; through the 1950s, ≈åtsuka held various karate competitions. In 1964, three of ≈åtsuka's students Tatsuo Suzuki, Toru Arakawa, and Hajime Takashima) from Nihon University toured Europe and the United States of America, demonstrating Wad≈ç-ry≈´ karate. Later life On April 29, 1966, Emperor Hirohito awarded ≈åtsuka the Order of the Rising Sun, Fifth Class for his contributions to karate. In the next few years, ≈åtsuka wrote two books on karate: Karate-Do, Volume 1 (1967, focused on kata) and Karate-Do, Volume 2 (1970, focused on kumite). On October 9, 1972, the Kokusai Budoin International_Martial_Arts_Federation (IMAF Japan) awarded ≈åtsuka the title of Shodai Karate-do Meijin Judan (first-generation karate master 10th dan); this was the first time this honor had been bestowed on a karate practitioner. ≈åtsuka continued to teach and lead Wad≈ç-ry≈´ karate into the 1980s, and died on January 29, 1982. In 1983, his son, Jiro Ohtsuka, became the second Grand Master of Wad≈ç-ry≈´ karate and honored his father by taking the name \\"Hironori ≈åtsuka II.\\" Notes a. ≈åtsuka's surname is sometimes also spelled as Ohtsuka.

It was a simple command interpreter, not designed for scripting, but nonetheless introduced several innovative features to the command-line interface and led to the development of the later Unix shells. History The name \\"shell\\" for a command-line interpreter and the concept of making the shell a user program outside of the operating system kernel were introduced in Unix's precursor Multics. An early feature of the Thompson shell was a compact syntax for input/output redirection. In Multics, redirecting the input or output of a command required separate commands to start and stop redirection; in Unix, one could simply add an argument to the command line consisting of the < symbol followed by a filename for input or the > symbol for output, and the shell would redirect I/O for the duration of the command. This syntax was already present by the release of the first version of Unix in 1971. A later addition was the concept of pipes. At the suggestion of Douglas McIlroy, the redirection syntax was expanded so that the output of one command could be passed to the input of another command. The original pipe syntax, as described in the Version 3 manual, was: command1 >command2> This syntax proved too ambiguous and was easily confused with redirection to and from files‚Äîthe system cannot tell if \\"command2\\" is the command \\"command2\\" or the file \\"command2\\". By Version 4, the syntax had changed to use both the  and ^ symbols to denote pipes: command1  command2 This produces exactly the same result as: command1 ^ command2 The > symbol changed into: command1 > file1 This would put the output of command1 into file1. The Thompson shell syntax for redirection with < and >, and piping with , has proven durable and has been adopted by most other Unix shells and command shells of several other operating systems, most notably on DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows. Decline and replacements The shell's design was intentionally minimalistic; even the if and goto statements, essential for control of program flow, were implemented as separate commands. As a result, by the 1975 release of Version 6 Unix, it was becoming clear that the Thompson shell was inadequate for most serious programming tasks. At this time, the developers of the Programmer's Workbench UNIX distribution, most notably John Mashey, began modifying the Thompson shell to make it more suitable for programming. The result, known as the PWB shell or the Mashey shell, included more advanced flow-control mechanisms and introduced shell variables, but remained limited by the necessity to remain compatible with the Thompson shell. Finally, the Thompson shell was replaced as the main Unix shell by the Bourne shell in Version 7 Unix and the C shell in 2BSD, both released in 1979. Since virtually all modern Unix and Unix-like systems are descended from V7 and 2BSD, the Thompson shell is generally no longer used. It is, however, available as open-source as part of several Ancient Unix source distributions, and has been ported to modern Unices as a historical exhibit.

It extended from an interchange at Deepwater with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) on the south bank of the navigable Kanawha River up a steep grade into the mountainous terrain southward, following the winding Loup Creek to reach a sawmill at Robson which was owned by the Loup Creek Estate. It was operated by the C&O; under a verbal agreement. In 1898, the Deepwater Railway was incorporated, and an extension was planned to reach nearby coal deposits in the general area of Glen Jean.

Some authors, however, reserve the term for more restricted grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy: context-sensitive grammars or context-free grammars. In a broader sense, phrase structure grammars are also known as constituency grammars. The defining trait of phrase structure grammars is thus their adherence to the constituency relation, as opposed to the dependency relation of dependency grammars. Constituency relation In linguistics, phrase structure grammars are all those grammars that are based on the constituency relation, as opposed to the dependency relation associated with dependency grammars; hence, phrase structure grammars are also known as constituency grammars.Matthews (1981:71ff.) provides an insightful discussion of the distinction between constituency- and dependency-based grammars. See also Allerton (1979:238f.), McCawley (1988:13), Mel'cuk (1988:12-14), Borsley (1991:30f.), Sag and Wasow (1999:421f.), van Valin (2001:86ff.). Any of several related theories for the parsing of natural language qualify as constituency grammars, and most of them have been developed from Chomsky's work, including * Government and binding theory * Generalized phrase structure grammar * Head-driven phrase structure grammar * Lexical functional grammar * The minimalist program * Nanosyntax Further grammar frameworks and formalisms also qualify as constituency-based, although they may not think of themselves as having spawned from Chomsky's work, e.g. * Arc pair grammar, and * Categorial grammar. The fundamental trait that these frameworks all share is that they view sentence structure in terms of the constituency relation. The constituency relation derives from the subject-predicate division of Latin and Greek grammars that is based on term logic and reaches back to Aristotle in antiquity. Basic clause structure is understood in terms of a binary division of the clause into subject (noun phrase NP) and predicate (verb phrase VP). The binary division of the clause results in a one-to-one-or-more correspondence. For each element in a sentence, there are one or more nodes in the tree structure that one assumes for that sentence. A two word sentence such as Luke laughed necessarily implies three (or more) nodes in the syntactic structure: one for the noun Luke (subject NP), one for the verb laughed (predicate VP), and one for the entirety Luke laughed (sentence S). The constituency grammars listed above all view sentence structure in terms of this one-to-one-or-more correspondence. ::Constituency and dependency relations Dependency relation By the time of Gottlob Frege, a competing understanding of the logic of sentences had arisen. Frege rejected the binary division of the sentence and replaced it with an understanding of sentence logic in terms of logical predicates and their arguments. On this alternative conception of sentence logic, the binary division of the clause into subject and predicate was not possible. It therefore opened the door to the dependency relation (although the dependency relation had also existed in a less obvious form in traditional grammars long before Frege). The dependency relation was first acknowledged concretely and developed as the basis for a comprehensive theory of syntax and grammar by Lucien Tesni√®re in his posthumously published work √âl√©ments de syntaxe structurale (Elements of Structural Syntax).See Tesni√®re (1959). The dependency relation is a one-to-one correspondence: for every element (word or morph) in a sentence, there is just one node in the syntactic structure. The distinction is thus a graph-theoretical distinction. The dependency relation restricts the number of nodes in the syntactic structure of a sentence to the exact number of syntactic units (usually words) that that sentence contains. Thus the two word sentence Luke laughed implies just two syntactic nodes, one for Luke and one for laughed. Some prominent dependency grammars are listed here: * Recursive categorical syntax, sometimes called algebraic syntax * Functional generative description * Lexicase * Link grammar * Meaning-text theory * Operator grammar * Word grammar Since these grammars are all based on the dependency relation, they are by definition NOT phrase structure grammars. Non-descript grammars Other grammars generally avoid attempts to group syntactic units into clusters in a manner that would allow classification in terms of the constituency vs. dependency distinction. In this respect, the following grammar frameworks do not come down solidly on either side of the dividing line: * Construction grammar * Cognitive grammar See also *Dependency grammar *Catena *Gottlob Frege *Lucien Tesni√®re *Predicate *Subject *Verb phrase Notes References *Allerton, D. 1979.

It was originally created on June 23, 1925 and awarded until 1934. During the period from 1935 to 1956, the Lenin Prize was not awarded, being replaced largely by the Stalin Prize. On August 15, 1956, it was reestablished, and continued to be awarded on every even-numbered year until 1990. The award ceremony was April 22, Vladimir Lenin's birthday. The Lenin Prize is different from the Lenin Peace Prize, which was awarded to foreign citizens rather than to citizens of the Soviet Union, for their contributions to the peace cause. Also, the Lenin Prize should not be confused with the Stalin Prize or the later USSR State Prize. Some persons were awarded both the Lenin Prize and the USSR State Prize. On April 23, 2018, the head of the Ulyanovsk Oblast, Sergey Ivanovich Morozov reintroduced the Lenin Prize for achievements in the humanities, literature, and art to coincide with the 150th birthday of Lenin in 2020.https://www.rt.com/politics/424869-russian-governor-lenin- award/https://chelorg.com/2018/04/23/in-the-ulyanovsk-region-have-revived-the- lenin-prize/ Awardee Note: This list is incomplete, short, and differs in detail from the complete and much longer Russian list, and is in chronological order.

The operation was part of the Iraq War. Operation Operation Panther Squeeze was a series of 18 raids in Lutafiyah to kill or capture individuals believed to be responsible for the attack against Spanish forces on 29 November. During the raids, 15 primary targets were captured with a total of 41 enemy personnel taken for questioning. Those captured included the cell leader Abu Abdullah, an intelligence officer, financier, and a doctor who treated terrorists so they can avoid treatment at local hospitals, and the actual attackers. A vehicle was also confiscated that may have been used in the recent assassination of the Lutafiyah police chief.

UTBMS was produced through a collaborative effort among the American Bar Association Section of Litigation, the American Corporate Counsel Association, and a group of major corporate clients and law firms coordinated and supported by Price Waterhouse LLP (now PricewaterhouseCoopers). UTBMS codes are now maintained and developed by the Legal Electronic Data Exchange Standard (LEDES) Oversight Committee. Background UTBMS coding is reflected in legal bills sent from a law firm to its corporate clients. Law firms will usually use coding on time and expenses only for those clients who explicitly request it. Most clients who use UTBMS also require electronic billing, usually with an invoice in a LEDES e-billing format. Fees, which are charges for attorney and legal assistant time, are coded with task and activity codes. There are five sets of task codes: Litigation, Intellectual Property, Counseling, Project and Bankruptcy. The set used for a given matter (i.e., case or transaction) depends upon the nature of that matter. Tasks may be summarized into phases. Tasks are often reported without reporting the phase, as this can be deduced from the task. The phase/task hierarchy is uniform in the Litigation, Intellectual Property and Bankruptcy task code sets. In the Project set, only the second phase contains multiple tasks. The Counseling set has only a single level. (In such situations, a code may be considered both a phase and a task, and it may be necessary to program the time and billing software this way.) There is a single set of activity codes, which is used in conjunction with each of the four task code sets. There is also a single set of expense codes, which are independent of phase, task and activity codes. The codes themselves are composed of a letter (the first letter of the task code set), followed by a three-digit number. Tasks sharing the same letter and first digit belong to the same phase. From time-to-time, the LEDES Oversight Committee (LOC), the administrative body that oversees these codes, adds and changes codes. In 2007, a set of Intellectual Property codes (for patents and trademarks) were finalized and ratified. https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20071023005247/en/Legal-Electronic- Data-Exchange-Standard-LEDES-FinalizesIn 2011, a set of \\"eDiscovery\\" codes were ratified. In 2015, the LOC ratified a set of Governance, Risk and Compliance codes based on the Open Compliance & Ethics Group (OCEG) GRC Capability Model.

He lost the subsequent election in 1979 and again in 1980. From 1984 to 1987, he served as the leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party at a time when the party was very unpopular because of its association with the federal Liberal Party. He was the first Chinese Canadian leader of a party in Canada. The party had no seats in the British Columbia Legislative Assembly during his leadership. In the 1986 election, however, the party won 6.74% of the popular vote, more than double they had won in the previous election.

Historically part of the township of Newton Heath, Lancashire, Miles Platting began to appear on maps in the 1820s, when it had begun to expand into a factory district as a result of the Industrial Revolution. That industrial growth resulted in a population that became very large for the size of the district, resulting in densely packed terraced housing that had degenerated into slums by 1950. As a result of this, crime rose and the area became an economically deprived part of the city. Miles Platting has undergone extensive redevelopment and regeneration, with former slum terraces removed to make way for council housing. History The Rochdale Canal is routed through Miles Platting. The origin of the name remains uncertain, but one suggestion is that it may derive from the word platt, meaning a small piece of ground, with miles being a corruption of mills. Hence Miles Platting may mean \\"mills on a small piece of ground\\". Miles Platting certainly did have many mills by the middle of the 19th century: Holland Mill, Victoria Mill and Ducie Mill were among the largest. By the 1870s a chemical works, timber yard, gas works and a tannery were also operating in the area alongside the many mills. This volume of industry in such a relatively small area inevitably led to the construction of densely packed back-to-back housing to provide homes for the necessary workforce. By the middle of the 20th century, with the decline in manufacturing industry and the closure of its local industries, Miles Platting had become a slum area inhabited by a deprived community. Today, Miles Platting contains just under 2,000 housing units, many of them managed by Adactus Housing Association on behalf of Manchester City Council, including 12 multi-storey blocks. The area, once recognised as being amongst the most deprived in the UK, has benefited from the substantial urban regeneration scheme for east Manchester initiated in the late 1990s. Miles Platting railway station lay at the junction of the lines from Manchester Victoria to Oldham and Stalybridge, but this closed in 1995, and the station was subsequently demolished. The railway line, which remains open for passenger traffic, separates Miles Platting from Collyhurst and Monsall. Between 1839 and 1844, the area was also the location of Oldham Road railway station, the original terminus for the Manchester and Leeds Railway until the line was extended to Manchester Victoria station in the latter year. The station was then converted to become a major railway goods depot by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, remaining in use until the 1960s. Governance Miles Platting was incorporated into the City of Manchester in 1838. Geography Landmarks A prominent building of Miles Platting is Victoria Mill, a huge former cotton mill that looms over the district and now houses offices and apartments. Its restoration was directed by Fr Dominic Kirkham of Corpus Christi. Religion Historically, much of the population of Miles Platting was of Irish Catholic or Italian descent, as evidenced by the large Corpus Christi Priory on Varley Street. The basilica has been served since 1889 by the Norbertine (Premonstratensian) Order, becoming an independent canonry of the order in 2004. Due to falling numbers and mounting repair and maintenance costs the basilica is now closed; the final Mass was celebrated by the Bishop of Salford on 27 April 2007. the basilica has been converted into the Usmania Banqueting Hall. From 1880 until the slum clearances of the 1970s there was a Salvation Army corps in Cash Street. Miles Platting is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford, and the Anglican Diocese of Manchester. Transport The majority of bus routes are operated by Stagecoach Manchester. Buses from the city centre include 74, 76, 76A. Bus route 77 offers two early morning journeys from Moston via Newton Heath. MCT also offers the 217 service from Shudehill Interchange to Ashton via Clayton.

To execute this order, numerous NKVD troikas were created on republican and various regional levels (krai and oblast). Investigation was to be performed by operative groups \\"in a speedy and simplified way\\", the results were to be delivered to troikas for trials. The chairman of a troika was the chief of the corresponding territorial subdivision of NKVD (People's Commissar of a republican NKVD, etc.). Usually a troika included the prosecutor of the republic/krai/oblast in question; if not, he or she was allowed to be present at the session of a troika. The third person was usually the Communist Party secretary of the corresponding regional level. The staff of these troikas were personally specified in the Order ‚Ññ 00447. Protocols of a troika session were passed to the corresponding operative group for executions of sentences. Times and places of executions of death sentences were ordered to be held in secret. That same order instructed to classify kulaks and other anti-Soviet elements into two categories: the First category (Category I) of repressed was subject to death by shooting, the Second category (Category II) was to be sent to GULAG correctional-labor camps. The order also set upper quotas per territory and category of social classes (proletariat, peasant, kulak, bourgeois, others). For example, the Byelorussian SSR was estimated to have 2,000 (Cat. I) & 10,000 (Cat. II), a total of 12,000 anti-Soviet social elements. It was specifically stressed that quotas were estimates and could not be exceeded without personal approval of Yezhov. But in practice this approval was easy to obtain, and eventually these initial quotas were exceeded by orders of magnitude. One instance in July 23, 1938, the Omsk NKVD chief named Gorbach requested an increased quota of thousands of more executions, since his men had already fulfilled their plan; the request was approved by Stalin personally, who promoted Gorbach to a larger district. By the autumn of 1937, the pressure to achieve arrests was so great that the NKVD interrogators began picking out names from the telephone directory or preselecting married men with children who, as every agent knew, were the quickest to confess. Within 1939, the system of repression was bursting at the seams‚Äîone tenth of the population might be arrested, but not half.The Forsaken, by Tim Tzouliadis pgs. 84-86; pg. 187 After this Order, the terms First/Second Category became standard abbreviations in NKVD documentation for \\"the highest measure of punishment\\" and \\"placing into corrective labor camps\\", respectively. The article III the Order of Conducting the Operation instructed to start the action for securing the anti-Soviet social elements on August 5, 1937 and finish it in four-month term. The implementation was swift. By August 15, 1937, 101,000 were arrested and 14,000 convicted. By the end of 1938, the NKVD had executed 386,798 Soviet citizens to fulfil order 00447.

He was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kampuchea led by Pol Pot and served in the 1975‚Äì79 government of Democratic Kampuchea as foreign minister and deputy prime minister. He was known as \\"Brother Number Three\\" as he was third in command after Pol Pot and Nuon Chea. His wife, Ieng Thirith (n√©e Khieu), served in the Khmer Rouge government as social affairs minister. Ieng Sary was arrested in 2007 and was charged with crimes against humanity but died of heart failure before the case against him could be brought to a verdict. Early years Ieng Sary was born in Nhan Hoa village, which is located in the subdistrict of Luong Hoa (also known as Loeung Va in Khmer), Ch√¢u Th√†nh District, Tr√† Vinh Province, southern Vietnam in 1925. His father, Kim Riem was a Khmer Krom while his mother Tran Thi Loi, was a Chinese immigrant who moved to Vietnam with her parents when she was a little girl. However, during his trial in 2011, it was stated that his mother was of mixed Vietnamese and Chinese descent.Sann Rada, Transcript of Trial Proceedings-Case File N¬∫ 002/19-09-2007-ECCC/TC, Day 4-5 December 2011, Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, retrieved 29 October 2013 Sary changed his name from the Vietnamese Kim Trang when he joined the Khmer Rouge. He was the brother-in-law by marriage of the Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot (real name: Saloth Sar). Sary and Saloth Sar studied at Phnom Penh's Lyc√©e Sisowath where their future wives, the sisters Khieu Thirith and Khieu Ponnary also studied. Before leaving Cambodia to study in Paris, Sary was engaged to Khieu Thirith. Sary and Saloth Sar also studied together in Paris. Whilst there, Sary rented an apartment in the Latin Quarter, a hotbed of student radicalism. He and Saloth Sar met with French communist intellectuals, and formed their own cell of Cambodian communists. Sary and Khieu Thirith married in the town hall of Paris' 15th arrondissement in the winter of 1951. Thirith took her husband's name, becoming Ieng Thirith. Mid-life After returning to Cambodia, he was inducted into the Central Committee of the Workers Party of Kampuchea in September 1960.Chandler, David P., Revising the Past in Democratic Kampuchea: When Was the Birthday of the Party?: Notes and Comments, in Pacific Affairs, Vol. 56, No. 2 (Summer, 1983), pp. 288‚Äì300. After the fall of the Khmer Republic on 17 April 1975, Sary made personal appeals to expatriates to help rebuild Cambodia. However, when they returned to Cambodia, they were arrested on arrival, and thrown into brutal detention centers.BBC News, Top Khmer Rouge diplomat in court. 30 June 2008 He took the nickname \\"Brother number 3\\" and, as head of diplomacy, he would be the only dignitary not to cultivate his secret identity. He welcomed foreign visitors and was also responsible for purges and arrests in the government's ministries. At the end of 1977, before the United Nations, he rejected accusations from Cambodian refugees who wanted to open a discussion with the Khmer Rouge government. Together with Pol Pot, Ieng Sary was sentenced to death in-absentia by the People's Revolutionary Tribunal after the Khmer Rouge was overthrown in 1979. King Norodom Sihanouk officially pardoned Ieng Sary in 1996 after his defection from Pol Pot. He was the founder of the Democratic National Union Movement, a split from the Cambodian National Unity Party.Peter H. Maguire. Facing Death in Cambodia.

He was taken from his holding cell at the special tribunal to a hospital on 4 March 2013 for what his lawyers said were gastrointestinal problems. Sary's body was transported to his home in Banteay Meanchey province. The body lay for seven days before being cremated. At the time of his death, Sary was on trial for his involvement in the Khmer Rouge.

The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where Corydoras is not present. Corydoras species are distributed in South America where found east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the R√≠o de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina. Species assigned to Corydoras display a broad diversity of body shapes and coloration. Corydoras are small fish, ranging from in SL., and are protected from predators by their body armor and by their sharp, typically venomous spines. Taxonomy The name Corydoras is derived from the Greek kory (helmet) and doras (skin). Corydoras is by far the largest genus of Neotropical fishes with more than 160 species. It is the sole genus in the tribe Corydoradini. C. difluviatilis is recognized as the basalmost species of Corydoradini, exhibiting several plesiomorphic features compared to the other species of Corydoras. The type species for this genus is Corydoras geoffroy. Several hundred species are not yet classified, but kept by aquarists. These species are given 'C-numbers', originally devised by Hans-Georg Evers for the German fishkeeping magazine DATZ in 1993. In 2006, 153 C-numbers had been assigned, of which 32 had been assigned appropriate scientific names. The species C. barbatus, C. macropterus and C. prionotos have been reclassified into the genus Scleromystax.Britto, M.R. (2003): Phylogeny of the subfamily Corydoradinae Hoedeman, 1952 (Siluriformes: Callichthyidae), with a definition of its genera. Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 153 (1): 119-154. Brochis had been differentiated from Corydoras due to the higher number of dorsal fin rays; however, Brochis has recently been suggested to be a synonym of Corydoras. This is contested and has not been universally accepted. The sixray corydoras belongs in Aspidoras. Ecology Corydoras are generally found in smaller-sized streams, along the margins of larger rivers, in marshes, and in ponds. They are native to slow-moving and almost still (but seldom stagnant) streams and small rivers of South America, where the water is shallow and very murky. Most species are bottom-dwellers, foraging in sand, gravel or detritus. The banks and sides of the streams are covered with a dense growth of plants and this is where the corys are found. They inhabit a wide variety of water types but tend toward soft, neutral to slightly acidic or slightly alkaline pH and 5-10 degrees of hardness. They can tolerate only a small amount of salt (some species tolerate none at all) and do not inhabit environments with tidal influences. They are often seen in shoals. Most species prefer being in groups and many species are found in schools or aggregations of hundreds or even thousands of individuals, usually of a single species, but occasionally with other species mixed in. Unlike most catfishes, which are nocturnal, these species are active during the daytime. Their main food is bottom-dwelling insects and insect larvae and various worms, as well as some vegetable matter. Although no corys are piscivorous, they will eat flesh from dead fishes. Their feeding method is to search the bottom with their sensory barbels and suck up food items with their mouth, often burying their snout up to their eyes. In several species of Corydoras, it has been observed that the fishes, after initial evasive reaction to threat, lie still; this is suggested to be a form of cryptic behavior. However, it is also argued that most species do not have cryptic coloration nor freezing behavior and continue to exist, likely due to their armor and venom. A few species of Otocinclus: (O. affinis, O. flexilis, O. mimulus and O. xakriaba) are considered to be Batesian mimics of certain Corydoras species (C. diphyes, C. garbei, C. nattereri and C. paleatus, respectively). These species have bony plates of armor and strong, frequently venomous https://www.practicalfishkeeping.co.uk/features/articles/handle- those-catfish-with-care spines as defenses, making them less palatable; by mimicking these species in size and coloration, Otocinclus avoid predation.Axenrot, T.E. & Kullander, S.O. (2003): Corydoras diphyes (Siluriformes: Callichthyidae) and Otocinclus mimulus (Siluriformes: Loricariidae), two new species of catfishes from Paraguay, a case of mimetic association. Ichthyological Exploration of Freshwaters, 14 (3): 249‚Äì272. A unique form of insemination has been described in Corydoras aeneus. When these fish reproduce, the male will present his abdomen to the female. The female will attach her mouth to the male's genital opening, creating the well-known \\"T-position\\" many Corydoras exhibit during courtship. The female will then drink the sperm. The sperm rapidly moves through her intestines and is discharged together with her eggs into a pouch formed by her pelvic fins. The female can then swim away and deposit the pouch somewhere else alone. Because the T-position is exhibited in other species than just C. aeneus, it is likely that this behavior is common in the genus. In the aquarium The genus is well known among aquarists for its many ornamental species. They are well suited to tropical freshwater community aquariums, as they get along well with other species and are not aggressive. Corydoras are quite timid and are recommended to be kept in shoals of six or more. Corys are mostly bottom feeders, so they should be offered sinking pellets as well as supplements of live and frozen foods. If flake foods are used, care should be taken to prevent all food from being eaten by faster moving fish at the higher levels of the tank. Most corys prefer soft, acidic water. They can, however, tolerate a wide range of water conditions, including temperatures that are cooler than tropical. They do not do well in fish tanks with high nitrate levels. This ion leads to the infection of the barbels, which will shorten and become useless. The barbels may also be affected by constant contact with a sharp substrate. Contrary to popular belief, these fish can be kept in a tank with gravel, as long as there are no sharp edges on the gravel without affecting their barbels, although they do prefer sand substrate. They are more likely to thrive if there is an open area of substrate on the bottom of the tank where they can obtain submerged food. It is a myth that salt cannot be used on this species of fish as a means of parasite medication. Salt can be added to the water of the Corydoras catfish in order to rid the fish of ich. These fish are fairly easy to keep, being peaceful, hardy, active and entertaining. Occasionally they will dart to the surface, sticking their snout above the water for an instant to take a \\"breath\\" of air. This behavior is perfectly normal and is not an indication that anything is wrong with the fish. However, if this is done in excess, it can indicate poor water conditions. Where investigated Corydoras sp. have been shown to be diurnal and crepuscular rather than nocturnal and activity can even peak at twilight. Corydoras are very good choices for a community aquarium and are widely kept throughout the world. Their longevity in the aquarium is noteworthy; C. aeneus is said to have lived 27 years in captivity and 20 years is not too uncommon.

It is located at the southwestern edge of the borough on Gravesend Bay. The neighborhood borders Bensonhurst and New Utrecht to the northeast across 86th Street; Dyker Beach Park and Golf Course to the northwest across 14th Avenue; and Gravesend to the east across Stillwell Avenue. History Bay 34th Street Bath Beach held one of Brooklyn's earliest African-American settlements. Freed slaves were given a parcel of land to settle in the mid-nineteenth century. The church that was once located in the heart of that community, Mount Zion Baptist, has moved to Bedford-Stuyvesant.Jackson, Kenneth T., and John B. Manbeck. The Neighborhoods of Brooklyn. New York: Citizens Committee for New York City, 1998. The term \\"Bath Beach\\" once described the beach resort specifically as part of the community of Bath, New York. Bath and Bath Beach are now more or less synonymous. The population of Bath Beach received a boost at the end of 1863 when steam dummy railroad service connected the community to the City of Brooklyn horsecar system terminal at 25th Street and 5th Avenue in Sunset Park. Bath Beach, named for the English spa, Bath, Somerset, was developed as a recreational seaside retreat for affluent families. It was part of the original Brooklyn town of New Utrecht. Although Coney Island was nearby, Bath Beach also had its own amusement park. Despite its name, the neighborhood no longer has an actual beach. The beach was paved over during the mid-twentieth century to create the Shore Parkway. On the northwestern half, a promenade was constructed to allow residents access to a sea wall. The southwestern half, filled in with land excavated from the construction of the Shore (Belt) Parkway in the early 1940s, extended Bensonhust Park,Bensonhust Park Cropsey Avenue between 21 Ave. and Bay Pkwy from Cropsey Avenue with ballfields and, later, the Ceasar's Bay shopping center. Demographics Bath Beach is primarily a working class community of semi-attached houses and small apartment houses. Bath Beach is becoming a mixed ethnic community as more recent Chinese, Middle Eastern, and former Soviet immigrants mix with the more established Italian-American population. The neighborhood contains a variety of small mom-and-pop businesses intermixed with chain stores, most of which are located at the Bay Shopping Center at the terminus of Bay Parkway, as well as on 86th Street. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Bath Beach was 29,931, an increase of 1,359 (4.8%) from the 28,572 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012.

Accessed June 14, 2016. Street grid PS 163, the Bath Beach School Streets of the neighborhood have a unique nomenclature. Four two-way thoroughfares traverse the neighborhood, running southeast/northwest, parallel to Shore Parkway: these are Cropsey Avenue, Bath Avenue, Benson Avenue, and 86th Street. Another, Harway Avenue, runs from Stillwell only as far as 24rth Avenue. The one-way northeast/southwest cross-streets are numbered, with the word \\"Bay\\" attached (to distinguish them from other numbering systems elsewhere in the borough), from Bay 7th Street in the northwest through Bay 54th Street in the southeast. Every third \\"Bay\\" numbered street is replaced with a two-way numbered avenue, from 14th Avenue in the northwest to 28th Avenue in the southeast (except for what would be 22nd Avenue, which is called Bay Parkway). These avenues (as well as 86th Street) are part of the larger grid of avenues and streets encompassing other neighborhoods to the north and west, in the former Towns of Gravesend, New Utrecht, and Brooklyn. Belt Parkway runs on the shorefront north of Bay Parkway and is close to the shorefront south of Bay Parkway. Parks Parks in Bath Beach include Bath Playground, Calvert Vaux Park, Scarangella Playground, and Anthony Catanzaro Square. Transportation Bath Beach is served by the of the New York City Subway system, along the BMT West End Line. Stations along the line serving the community are 18th Avenue, 20th Avenue, Bay Parkway, 25th Avenue, and Bay 50th Street. MTA Regional Bus Operations routes serving Bath Beach include the . Library The Brooklyn Public Library's Ulmer Park branch is located at 2602 Bath Avenue near 26th Avenue. It was founded as a subdivision of another library in 1951 before becoming a full-fledged circulation branch in 1956. The current building was opened in 1963 and was renovated in 2016.  In popular culture  During the 1970s, Bath Beach's commercial strip along 86th Street was used for scenes in the 1971 feature film The French Connection, in the opening credits to the popular television series Welcome Back, Kotter, and most famously in the opening scene of the 1977 feature film Saturday Night Fever. Tony Manero, the lead character (played by John Travolta), walks along the sidewalk, admires shoes in a storefront window, buys two (stacked) slices of pizza through a pizzeria window-counter at Lenny's Pizza, and ends up at the hardware store where he works (based on a real hardware store on Fifth Avenue in nearby Bay Ridge). The strip was used again in 2016 for the filming of Red Hot Chili Peppers - Go Robot music video. The film John Wick: Chapter 3 features the main character on horseback along 86th Street.

The River's Flow The Mara River basin covers a surface of 13,504 km2, of which approximately 65% is located in Kenya and 35% in Tanzania.Jim K. Kairu, \\"Biodiversity Action Plan for Sustainable Management: Mara River Basin\\" (WWF, 2008) From its sources in the Kenyan highlands, the river flows for about 395 km and originates from the Mau Escarpment and drains into Lake Victoria. The basin can be roughly divided into four land use and/or administrative units. The Mara's Regions The Mau Escarpment: The Mara River originates from the Napuiyapi swamp (2932 m), with the main perennial tributaries being the Amala and the Nyangores, which drain from the western Mau Escarpment. This part of the basin supports besides forests, both small-scale agriculture (less than 10 acres) and medium-size farms (often tea farms up to 40 acres). The Kenyan Rangelands: In this area, the Amala and Nyangores rivers flow out of the Mau Escarpment and converge to form the Mara River. The river then meanders further through open savannah grasslands that is mostly governed by Maasai group ranches and used as pasture for livestock and for both small ‚Äî and large-scale agriculture (more than 40 acres). The basins of four important tributaries to the Mara (the Talek, Engare, Sand and Engito rivers) are also located in this area, together with some upland areas like the Loita Hills. The Protected areas: Eventually the river flows into the world-famous Masai Mara National Reserve, where it merges with three of the four mentioned tributaries. On the Kenyan-Tanzanian border, the river flows into the Serengeti National Park and is joined by the fourth major tributary: the Sand (or Longaianiet) River. In these wildlife parks human activity is restricted to wildlife viewing. Downstream in Mara Region Tanzania: Just after the Mara River flows out of Ikorongo Game Reserve (which borders Serengeti National Park) it meanders sharply northwards. At the location where the river meanders into the southwestern direction again the main channel is lost in different streams, which feed the downstream Mara wetlands. These streams and wetlands continue for about 70 kilometres downstream. In this part of the basin human and livestock densities are high and small-scale subsistence agriculture is the main land use. The Mara River basin is one of the ten drainage basins that feed into Lake Victoria, and is therefore functionally and ecologically related to the socio-economic activities in Lake Victoria and along the River Nile. Altitudes and Ranges The altitudes in the basin range from 2,932 m around the sources in the Mau Escarpment to 1,134 m around Lake Victoria. The amount of precipitation varies according to these altitudes. The Mau Escarpment receives most rainfall with a mean annual rainfall between 1,000 and 1,750 mm. The transboundary middle savannah grasslands receive an average between 900 and 1,000 mm, and the Kenyan lower Loita hills and the area around Lake Victoria only about 700 and 850 mm rain per year. On top of this rainfall variability in space, the region is also known for its rainfall variability in time, which means that the different areas all receive variable amounts of rainfall over the year. The rainfall seasons are bi-modal, with the long rains starting in mid-March to June with a peak in April, while the short rains occur between September and December. Mara river in Narok County The Mara's Effects The river is a vital source to grazing animals within the reserve. Although during the dry season it may often appear shallow, it may swell to up to twice its normal size after heavy rainfall. This can create rapids in the river, which may lead to shortage of food for predators that cannot cross the river to hunt. Between the 1950s and 2006, the seasonal water quantities in the Mara have changed significantly in the sense that there are now higher peaks and lows in the river flow. These dynamics are associated with changes in land use in the catchments area: decreasing vegetation covers are causing a faster run-off of rainwater. Near the river mouth in Tanzania, the rapidly fluctuating water levels in Lake Victoria of the previous century have further added to discharge difficulties of the Mara River. Consequently, floods have become more common and large parts of the Tanzanian Mara Wetlands have become more permanent instead of temporary wetlands.MARA DRYLAND BECOMES WETLAND: a social-ecological and multi-scale perspective on the adaptability of the livelihood system around the Tanzanian Mara wetlands.

The Niger Coast Protectorate was a British protectorate in the Oil Rivers area of present-day Nigeria, originally established as the Oil Rivers Protectorate in 1891 and confirmed at the Berlin Conference the following year, renamed on 12 May 1893, and merged with the chartered territories of the Royal Niger Company on 1 January 1900 to form the Southern Nigeria Protectorate.  Oil Rivers Protectorate  An 1894 letter from Old Calabar in the Oil Rivers Protectorate. The main post office was established at Old Calabar in November 1891; sub-offices existed at Benin, Bonny, Brass, Opobo, and Warri. Initially the postage stamps of Britain were used; in July 1892 they were overprinted with \\"BRITISH / PROTECTORATE / OIL / RIVERS\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20180422020418/http://www.stampworldhistory.com/country- profiles-2/africa/niger-coast/ Retrieved 12 August 2018. A pressing need for halfpenny values in mid-1893 resulted in a variety of surcharges on 2d and 2d stamps. While most simply read \\"HALF / PENNY\\", with a horizontal bar to obliterate the old value, some were overprinted \\"1/2 d\\" twice, with the intent that they be bisected diagonally to produce two 1/2d stamps.  Niger Coast Protectorate  A 2 pence stamp of Niger Coast surcharged to one halfpenny and used at Old Calabar in 1894. A name change occurred just as new stamps were being prepared, and so the first issue of the Niger Coast Protectorate, featuring a 3/4 portrait of Queen Victoria, was inscribed \\"OIL RIVERS\\" but obliterated and re-engraved \\"NIGER COAST\\" in a way which makes it look like an overprint. Available in November 1893 in six denominations with various colors, they were superseded the following May by stamps in a new design and the correct inscription. This design continued for the remainder of the protectorate's existence, with a change over to use the \\"Crown & CA\\" watermark from 1897 onwards (the paper had previously been unwatermarked) and an additional three denominations.

The system is widely used in North America. The warrant is issued by the train dispatcher and delivered to the train crew via radio. The train crew copies the instructions onto a pre-printed paper form and reads back the warrant to ensure that nothing was misunderstood. Operation Track warrants are issued granting main track use between two named points (i.e. milepost sign, station, and/or any fixed physical point, such as a switch). The dispatcher may also issue time constraints (known as \\"Box 6\\" on a standard form), although the track warrants remain in effect until cleared by a member of the receiving crew. Track warrants are sometimes used in conjunction with a block signal system to provide rear-end protection against following trains.GCOR Sixth Edition Section 14 Track warrants usually allow a train to move in one direction only‚Äîa \\"Proceed\\" instruction. Sometimes a train may also be given authorizing movements in either direction, called a \\"Work between\\" instruction. However, only one train can have a section of track at one particular time if moving in the same direction. If there are two trains moving in the same direction, the leading train must give up the track before the trailing train can obtain a track warrant for that territory. For example, if Train 56 has a track warrant to proceed in the northbound direction from MP (milepost) 14 to MP 77 and there is a train following, then Train 56 must give up a portion or all of its warrant before the following train can be issued the track that Train 56 has already cleared. Many times this is accomplished by the dispatcher asking the leading train for their milepost location and then issuing a warrant up to that point to the trailing train. Continuing the previous example, if Train 56 is clear of MP 50, the dispatcher can issue a warrant to the trailing train up to MP 50, but not beyond it. Once a train has received a new track warrant or has left track warrant territory they will release the entirety of their warrant back to the dispatcher.GCOR Sixth Edition Section 14.3 Maintenance of Way crews receive track bulletins (usually called \\"Form A\\", \\"Form B\\" or \\"Form C\\") in order to perform track work that would otherwise be interrupted by passing trains. This is done by providing the maintenance crew with a form or protection, or allowing work to be done behind a passing train.GCOR Sixth Edition Section 14.5 = Comparison with Direct Traffic Control = Track Warrant Control is similar to yet distinct from the concept of Direct Traffic Control (DTC), appearing later as railroads migrated fully from older forms of Train order operation. DTC was designed to facilitate the movement of trains using concepts of blocks and sidings previously used with Train Orders. DTC is only a mechanism to transfer movement authority and can only work within an arrangement of predefined blocks.GCOR Sixth Edition Section 16 Track Warrant systems appropriate the remaining responsibility of Train Order systems to notify operating personnel of safety directives that include things like temporary speed restrictions, tracks out of service, etc. and combines them with the movement authority function of DTC. Furthermore, Track Warrants are not limited to fixed blocks and can be issued and released from almost any explicitly identified landmark along the rail line.CSX Operating Rules 2007 Edition: Rules 170-175, 180-183 Standard instructions used in track warrants Most track warrants in the U.S. follow a standard form as suggested by the General Code of Operating Rules,GCOR Sixth Edition section 14.0 consisting of several standard instructions to mark specific notes or conditions for a warrant. These vary from temporary speed restrictions to rules regarding meeting other trains. * Box 1. Void on a previous warrant. * Box 2. Proceed from point to point. * Box 3. Proceed from point to point (cont.) * Box 4. Work between certain limits. * Box 5. Not in effect until ____ . * Box 6. Authority expires at ____ . * Box 7. Not in effect until after the arrival of ____ at ____ . * Box 8. Hold main track at last named point. * Box 9. Do not foul limits ahead of ____ . * Box 10. Clear main track at last named point. * Box 11. Between ____ and ____ make all movements at restricted speed: limits occupied by train. * Box 12. Between ____ and ____ make all movements at restricted speed: limits occupied by men or equipment. * Box 13. Do not exceed ____ mph between _____ and ____ . * Box 14. Do not exceed ____ mph between _____ and ____ . * Box 15. Flag protection not required against following trains on same track. * Box 16. Track bulletins in effect. * Boxes 17 and 18: Other specific instructions. Some railroad systems, such as RailAmerica, use additional boxes: * Box 18. Joint with _____ between ____________ and _____________ . * Box 19. Expect to find the following switch(es) lined and locked in the reverse position: _________ . * Box 20. The following switch(es) may be left lined and locked in the reverse position: _________ . Non-GCOR Track Warrant systems include the NORAC Form D Control System (DCS) which was later partly adopted by CSX to supplant its older DTC system. Use of track warrants on specific railroads The BNSF Railway uses track warrants on its El Paso Subdivision which runs from Belen, New Mexico to El Paso, Texas, with the dispatcher in Fort Worth, Texas. There are no electrical signals on the route. BNSF also uses TWC (Track Warrant Control) between Williams, AZ (Seligman Subdivision)to Phoenix, AZ (Phoenix Subdivision), Forsyth Subdivision between Jones Jct. (a suburb of Billings, Montana) and Hysham, Montana. Unlike the El Paso Subdivision, ABS is used. And on the Madill Subdivision between Denison, TX and Irving, TX with an ABS signal overlay on the northern ten or so miles between Denison and Sherman, TX. Track Warrant Control is also used in many other lower to medium traffic volume sections of the BNSF system, sometimes with an automatic block signal system overlay, and on the other class one railroads as well. Some smaller Class II railroads, such as the Iowa Interstate Railroad, and many Class III railroads are dispatched completely by track warrant. Canadian railways use a similar system called Occupancy Control System (OCS), in which movements are controlled via clearances issued over the radio from the Rail Traffic Controller to the train. The system is in wide use on lines that aren't installed with centralized traffic control (CTC). Outside of North America, TasRail in Tasmania, Australia uses track warrants on its system. KiwiRail in New Zealand also uses track warrants.

The story focuses on Eurydice's choice to return to earth with Orpheus or to stay in the underworld with her father (a character created by Ruhl). Ruhl made several changes to the original myth's story-line. The most noticeable of these changes was that in the myth Orpheus succumbs to his desires and looks back at Eurydice, while in Ruhl's version Eurydice calls out to Orpheus (causing him to look back) perhaps in part because of her fear of reentering the world of the living and perhaps as a result of her desire to remain in the land of the dead with her father. Ruhl's script has been explicitly written so as to be a playground for the designer of the sets. The play was the basis for an opera, Eurydice, which premiered in 2020.

The play consists of three movements, divided into numerous scenes: 7 in the first movement, 20 in the second movement, and 3 in the third movement. The play begins with Eurydice and Orpheus, two young lovers, who are about to get married. In the underworld, Eurydice's dead father has managed to preserve his memory and his ability to read and write, and tries to send her letters. During the wedding, Eurydice goes outside to get a drink of water and she meets a man (the \\"Nasty Interesting Man\\") who tells her he has a letter from her father. Eurydice decides to go to his apartment to retrieve the letter, but as she leaves his apartment after resisting the man's attempts to seduce her, she trips and falls to her death on the stairs. At the beginning of the second movement, there is no set change, but \\"the movement to the underworld is marked by the entrance of stones\\": Little Stone, Big Stone, and Loud Stone, who serve as a chorus. Eurydice enters the underworld through an elevator, inside which it is raining. Upon arrival, she meets her father, who tries to reteach Eurydice about her past since she has lost her memory after being dipped in the river Lethe. The Stones try unsuccessfully to stop them, because the dead are not allowed to remember their past or speak in human language. Rooms are also not allowed in the underworld, but Eurydice's father creates one for her out of pieces of string. He gradually re-teaches her human language and her past. While the father is away at work, the lord of the underworld enters as a child riding a tricycle and attempts to seduce Eurydice, but fails. Meanwhile, in the land of the living, Orpheus writes a letter to Eurydice, which her father delivers and reads to her. Orpheus also sends her a copy of the Complete Works of Shakespeare by attaching it to a piece of string, and Eurydice's father reads to her from King Lear. Orpheus sends another letter, and then resolves to go to the underworld himself to find her. In the third movement, Orpheus arrives at the gates of the underworld, singing a song so powerful it makes the Stones weep. The lord of the underworld tells him that he may take Eurydice back, but only if he does not turn around to look at her. Eurydice is then faced with the decision to either stay with her father or go back with her husband. At her father's insistence, she follows Orpheus. But as she catches up to him, she calls out his name, and he turns to look at her, causing her to die a second death. Meanwhile, her father has decided that he wants to forget everything, and dips himself in the river again. When Eurydice returns, her father is lying silent on the ground, having lost all of his language and memory forever. As Eurydice mourns her father, the lord of the underworld returns, having grown from a child to superhuman height. He orders her to be his bride. Eurydice pens a letter to Orpheus and his next wife, then immerses herself in the river and lies down in forgetfulness. Finally, Orpheus too enters from the elevator, having truly died this time. He finds Eurydice's letter to him, but because he has been dipped in the river, he cannot read it. Opera Ruhl adapted the play into the libretto for an opera, Eurydice by Matthew Aucoin, which premiered at the Los Angeles Opera on February 1, 2020.

There are many causes of this symptom, including heredity and bruising. Causes =Allergies, asthma, and eczema= Any condition that causes the eyes to itch can contribute to darker circles due to rubbing or scratching the skin around them. Hay fever sufferers in particular will notice under-eye \\"smudges\\" during the height of the allergy season. Also, dark circles from allergies are caused by superficial venous congestion in the capillaries under eyes. =Medications= Any medications that cause blood vessels to dilate can cause circles under the eyes to darken. The skin under the eyes is very delicate, any increased blood flow shows through the skin. =Anemia= The lack of nutrients in the diet, or the lack of a balanced diet, can contribute to the discoloration of the area under the eyes. It is believed that iron deficiency can cause dark circles as well. Iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia and this condition is a sign that not enough oxygen is getting to the body tissues. The skin can also become more pale during pregnancy and menstruation (due to lack of iron), allowing the underlying veins under the eyes to become more visible. =Fatigue= A lack of sleep and mental fatigue can cause paleness of the skin, allowing the blood underneath the skin to become more visible and appear more blue or darker. =Age= Dark circles are likely to become more noticeable and permanent with age. This is because as people get older, their skin loses collagen, becoming thinner and more translucent. Circles may also gradually begin to appear darker in one eye than the other as a result of some habitual facial expressions, such as an uneven smile. =Sun exposure= Prompts your body to produce more melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. =Periorbital hyperpigmentation= Periorbital hyperpigmentation is the official name for when there is more melanin produced around the eyes than is usual, giving them a darker color. Treatment At one time, hydroquinone solution was often mixed in an oil- free moisturizer that acted like a skin bleach. However the use of hydroquinone for skin whitening has been banned in European countries due to health concerns. In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its approval of hydroquinone for over the counter preparations warning that it may cause cancer or have many other detrimental effects. The use of hydroquinone skin-whitening products can be toxic, harmful or lethal for humans. Modern treatments include topical creams that are marketed for the condition. Various ingredients have been researched, developed and included in these creams. For example, recently, chemical compounds called alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) have been added as a beneficial ingredient to creams for dark circles. Specialist treatments including laser and intense pulsed light skin surgery can also be used. A compounding cream of Pfaffia paniculata, Ptychopetalum olacoides and Lilium candidum has also been reported as an effective treatments. Low-level laser therapy, autologous fat transplantation and hyaluronic acid fillers are also alternative treatment options. In addition, many skin care ingredients can help in the form of eye creams. Caffeine is a potent vasoconstrictor that has been proven to improve the look of dark circles by constricting, or tightening, the dilated vessels under eyes. Vitamin C can help brighten hyperpigmentation as well as thicken the dermal layer of skin which conceals dark circles See also * Periorbital puffiness References Category:Diseases of the eye and adnexa Category:Symptoms Category:Periorbital conditions ","title":"Periorbital dark circles"},{"id":"1160590","text":"Prospect Park South is a small neighborhood in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York City, located south of Prospect Park. It is included within the Prospect Park South Historic District, which was designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1979 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The historic district is bounded by Church Avenue to the north, the BMT Brighton Line () of the New York City Subway to the east, Beverley Road to the south, and between Stratford Road and Coney Island Avenue to the west.New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission \\"Prospect Park South Historic District Map\\" Prospect Park South, along with other neighborhoods within Flatbush, is policed by the 70th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.70th Precinct, NYPD. History In 1899 developer Dean Alvord purchased about of farmland in order to create Prospect Park South, a community of substantial homes, a \\"rural park within the limitations of the conventional city block and city street.\\" Alvord characterized the development as rus in urbe, the country in the city.Gunnison, pp.86-92 The location was selected to take advantage of the train service on the Brooklyn and Brighton Beach Railroad of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT). The line, now known as the BMT Brighton Line, offered express and local train service that remains to this day. The trains emerged at Fulton Street as an elevated line and continued across the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan.Gunnison, pp.21-23 Gatepost at Church Avenue & Buckingham Road. Gateposts such as this mark many of the entrances to streets in the historic district. Once he had purchased the land, Alvord laid out all the necessary utilities and marked the entrance of most streets with brick piers with cast concrete plaques bearing the bas- relief inscription \\"PPS\\". He also hired John Aitkin, a Scottish landscape gardener, to supervise the plantings for the lawns and the Flatbush Malls, with meticulous attention given to details. Trees, for instance, were not planted only along the curb line, but also at the building line as well, to give the streets greater breadth of vision, to block out adjoining houses, and provide the illusion that each house was the only one on the block. Both Norway maples and Carolina poplars were used: the poplars for immediate shade, and the slower-growing maples for long-term shade. Alvord did all this before selling a single plot. Alvord also hired architect John J. Petit and a staff to design the houses in the development, although clients could also provide their own architect if they preferred to. Petit ended up designing many of the houses in the development, in a wide variety of styles, including Colonial Revival, Tudor Revival and Queen Anne. The houses in Prospect Park South were required to be substantial, freestanding homes exceeding and costing over US$5,000. Several other restrictions were also placed upon builders wishing to develop the lots.Garvin, Alexander. The American City: What Works, What Doesn't (McGraw-Hill Professional, 2002) pp. 308-310 While not the first attempt at suburban development in the area, Alvord's vision excited the interest of the wealthy of Brooklyn Heights and Manhattan residents. Ultimately, Alvord's restrictions not only created an exciting new design but a standard to become a blueprint for the modern suburb. Enthusiasm for his design in following years would see South Midwood, Fiske Terrace, Ditmas Park, the Beverley Squares, and many more developments spring up in the surrounding area to accommodate the demand, together forming what is now known as Victorian Flatbush. In 1972, New York's Albanian community established a mosque at 1325 Albemarle Road. Prospect Park South was designated as a historic district by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1979. Notable houses The Alvord Mansion at 1522 Albemarle Road was built by Alvord for his family. Later, it was purchased by Israel Matz, founder of the Ex-lax Company. The Alvord Mansion burned down c.1955 under mysterious conditions after its sale by the Matz family to apartment developers fell through in the face of community opposition.

Page, a civil engineer and entrepreneur, and his silent partner, millionaire industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers of Standard Oil fame. It was put together with the intention of creating an outlet to Hampton Roads, where coal mined along their older West Virginia short-line railroad, the Deepwater Railway, could be exported. In 1907, the Tidewater Railway was renamed the \\"Virginian Railway\\". A short time later, the Virginian Railway acquired its sister, the Deepwater Railway. Before the Tidewater division of the Virginian was linked to the Deepwater line, it played an important role, in conjunction with the regional Norfolk Southern Railway, in transporting thousands of people to the Jamestown Exposition of 1907, an event marking the three-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the British colony at Jamestown. It took two years to complete, but in 1909, both portions (the Tidewater portion and the Deepwater portion) were finally completed, and coal exports, from a new coal pier at Sewell's Point, began. In 1959, the Virginian Railway was merged with the Norfolk and Western Railway. This was the first major U.S. railroad merger of the last half of the twentieth century, an era of rampant mergers, acquisitions, and consolidations among the American railroads.

He was said to have been a son of Einion Yrth and Prawst ferch Deithlyn. Cadwallon's reign is believed to have run from his father's death in about 500 until his own death some time between 517 and 534. He is often credited with having driven the last Irish settlers off the island of Anglesey. According to one tradition, Cadwallon and his army padlocked their own feet to their stirrups so that they could not be tempted to flee the battle. Cadwallon's epithet, Lawhir, may possibly refer to him having longer than usual arms or might also be a metaphor, referring to the extent of his authority. The late medieval poet Iolo Goch claims that he could \\"reach a stone from the ground to kill a raven, without bending his back, because his arm was as long as his side to the ground.\\" According to Gildas, Cadwallon's son, Maelgwn Gwynedd, murdered his uncle in order to ascend the throne, which suggests that someone other than Maelgwn himself inherited the kingdom upon Cadwallon's death. No clear evidence exists as to who this \\"lost king\\" might be (assuming, of course, that Gildas's account is reliable), but some have suggested the name of Owain Ddantgwyn as the unfortunate predecessor. Caswallon's Llys There has been a longstanding association, in antiquarian writings, between Cadwallon and a possible Llys (medieval royal court building) known as Caswallon's Llys. This was indicated on the Ordnance Survey map of 1889 as within a field near Mynnydd Eilian, in the Llaneilian community, in the north-east corner of the Isle of Anglesey. With no obvious remains by the 20th century, it had been largely discredited as a Llys site until a geophysical survey in 2009 identified foundations of a rectangular building within a trapezoidal enclosure, for which an early medieval site was a strong possibility.

According to Article 48-50 of the Constitution, :::48. The President shall be entitled to propose the dissolution of the Saeima. Following this proposal, a national referendum shall be held. If in the referendum more than half of the votes are cast in favour of dissolution, the Saeima shall be considered dissolved, new elections called, and such elections held no later than two months after the date of the dissolution of the Saeima. :::49. If the Saeima has been dissolved, the mandate of the members of the Saeima shall continue in effect until the newly elected Saeima has convened, but the dissolved Saeima may only hold sittings at the request of the President. The agenda of such sittings shall be determined by the President. :::50. If in the referendum more than half of the votes are cast against the dissolution of the Saeima, then the President shall be deemed to be removed from office, and the Saeima shall elect a new President to serve for the remaining term of office of the President so removed. Since 2009, Article 14 also foresees the right for the citizens without involvement of president: :::14. Not less than one tenth of electors has the right to initiate a national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima. If the majority of voters and at least two thirds of the number of the voters who participated in the last elections of the Saeima vote in the national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima, then the Saeima shall be deemed recalled. The right to initiate a national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima may not be exercised one year after the convening of the Saeima and one year before the end of the term of office of the Saeima, during the last six months of the term of office of the President, as well as earlier than six months after the previous national referendum regarding recalling of the Saeima. :::The electors may not recall any individual member of the Saeima. Thus, the Constitution establishes one of the possible procedures to resolve a political crisis in a parliamentary republic by entitling the President, an otherwise largely ceremonial figure, to initiate the dissolution of parliament, but at the potential cost of his own office, should his initiative be rejected by popular vote. This constitutional power was used for the first time in the history of the Latvian state by the President, Valdis Zatlers, on May 28, 2011. This move was in response to the parliament's refusal to sanction a search at the home of AinƒÅrs ≈†lesers, a Saeima member and former Cabinet minister. The referendum on the dissolution of parliament has to take place no later than two months time after the President's decree. On May 30 the Central Election Commission resolved that the vote take place on July 23, 2011. Previously, following the riots in Riga on January 13, 2009, President Zatlers promised to dissolve the Saeima unless it adopted amendments to the Constitution providing for the possibility of dissolving it by popular vote.The Latvian President‚Äôs Announcement to the Mass Media on January 14, 2009 14.01.2009 These amendments were adopted by the Saeima on April 8, 2009, but on April 1, 2009, the President decided not to dissolve parliament. The Latvian parliament, the Saeima, was also dissolved unconstitutionally on May 15, 1934 following a bloodless coup organized by then-Prime Minister KƒÅrlis Ulmanis. The Cabinet declared a military state of emergency and suspended the activity of all parties which effectively put a ban on the work of the Saeima.Valdƒ´bas Vƒìstnesis: Tre≈°diena, 16. maijs, 1934 This act was in direct violation of the Constitution and led to the establishment of an authoritarian regime.

The protectorate spanned and included the states of the Sokoto Caliphate and parts of the former Bornu Empire, conquered in 1902. The first High Commissioner of the protectorate was Frederick Lugard, who suppressed slavery and tribal raiding and created a system of administration built around native authorities. The Protectorate was ended on 1 January 1914, when its area was unified with the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and the Lagos Colony, becoming the Northern Province of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. History 1914 map of the Northern & Southern Nigeria Protectorates, by John Bartholomew & Co. The Berlin Conference of 1884 and 1885 provided the area that would become the Northern Nigeria Protectorate to the British. The Royal Niger Company was formed in 1886 with George Taubman Goldie as the vice governor. The Company negotiated trade agreements and political agreements, sometimes coercive, with many of the chieftains, emirs, and the Sokoto Caliphate. In 1897, Frederick Lugard was the appointed head of the West African Frontier Force which was tasked with stopping Fulani resistance and possible French incursions in the northwest area. On 1 January 1900, the Royal Niger Company's charter was revoked and the British government took control, in a ceremony where Lugard read the proclamation. The Royal Niger Company was paid ¬£865,000 and was given the rights to half of all mining revenue in a large part of the areas for 99 years in exchange for ceding the territory to the British government. Lugard was appointed the High Commissioner of the newly created Northern Nigeria Protectorate. Lokoja was the capital from 1900, but Zungeru became the headquarters for the protectorate in 1902 because it was the most northerly city accessible by river transport. Military operations began in 1902 and continued for about five years of sporadic fighting. The remnants of the Bornu Empire were conquered in 1902 and the Sokoto Caliphate and the Kano Emirate were taken over in 1903. Fighting continued in 1904 in Bassa. In 1906 a large Mahdist revolution began outside of the city of Sokoto in the village of Satiru, a combined force of the British and the British-appointed Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Attahiru II, destroyed the town and killed most residents involved. After 1907 there were fewer revolts and use of military force by the British and the focus of the High Commissioner turned toward taxation and administration. Administration The British Administration began with Frederick Lugard as the first High Commissioner. In 1907, Lugard left Nigeria for Hong Kong and Percy Girouard became the new High Commissioner. Girouard had a long history of rail construction in Canada and Africa and was tasked with substantial railroad construction in the Protectorate. In 1909, Henry Hesketh Bell, the governor of the Uganda Protectorate was appointed high commissioner. In 1912, it was estimated that the area of Northern Nigeria was approximately and had a population of about 10 million people. Charles Lindsay Temple became the acting Head Commissioner in 1911 and 1912 and began overseeing, with close collaboration with Lugard, the creation of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria One defining characteristic of administration in Northern Nigeria Protectorate was the inclusion of chiefs and emirs as \\"native authorities\\" fitting into British administration. Taxation proved very difficult in the protectorate for the first years of British rule. Lugard's attempts to institute poll taxes were foiled by the Emirates, the need to introduce coin controversy and attempts to tax trade were opposed by powerful merchants. This created a substantial deficit in the budget of the Protectorate and public works projects had to be paid by grants from the British Empire. As a result, the British often had significant shortages of British personnel before 1907. These pragmatic concerns resulted in incorporation of the traditional authorities within the British structure. These same financial and administrative challenges resulted in discussions led by Lugard for the unification of the Lagos Colony, the Southern Nigeria Protectorate, and Northern Nigeria. The disparities between the protectorates was to be corrected by creating a central administration in Lagos, with custom revenues from the south paying for the projects in the north. The unified Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria began in 1914 and had two lieutenant governors with one responsible for the area of the southern province and another responsible for the northern province. The administration in the north remained largely separate and included and deepened the use of native authorities. These divisions have been found to persist in many respects to this day.

This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate. First stamps Postage stamps were issued specifically for the Northern Nigeria Protectorate beginning in 1900.https://web.archive.org/web/20180503063509/http://www.stampworldhistory.com/country- profiles-2/africa/northern-nigeria/ Retrieved 12 August 2018. All stamps of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate are definitive issues of a Key Plate design, differing in the sovereign depicted, type of paper, watermarks, and choice of colored or colorless numerals for the denomination. The first series consisted of nine stamps with values ranging from 1/2 pence to 10 shillings, depicting Queen Victoria. The second series, consisting of identical denominations, but in slightly different colors was issued on July 1, 1902, depicting King Edward VII. Unusually, a ¬£25 stamp was issued in April 1904. This was really intended as a revenue stamp, it being nearly impossible to invent a piece of mail needing so much postage. It was used to pay for imported liquor licences. It is the great rarity of philately with copies commanding a high price. The King Edward series was reissued in 1905 in eight denominations, and again in 1910‚Äì11 in eleven denominations.

He is considered one of the founders of modern epidemiology, in part because of his work in tracing the source of a cholera outbreak in Soho, London, in 1854, which he curtailed by removing the handle of a water pump. Snow's findings inspired the adoption of anaesthesia as well as fundamental changes in the water and waste systems of London, which led to similar changes in other cities, and a significant improvement in general public health around the world.  Early life and education  Snow was born on 15 March 1813 in York, England, the first of nine children born to William and Frances Snow in their North Street home, and was baptised at All Saints' Church, North Street, York. His father was a labourerWedding Record of William Snow and Frances Empson, Huntington All Saints, 24/05/1812 who worked at a local coal yard, by the Ouse, constantly replenished from the Yorkshire coalfield by barges, but later was a farmer in a small village to the north of York.Census 1841 The neighbourhood was one of the poorest in the city, and was frequently in danger of flooding because of its proximity to the River Ouse. Growing up, Snow experienced unsanitary conditions and contamination in his hometown. Most of the streets were unsanitary and the river was contaminated by runoff water from market squares, cemeteries and sewage. All Saints' Church, North Street, York, where Snow was baptised From a young age, Snow demonstrated an aptitude for mathematics. In 1827, when he was 14, he obtained a medical apprenticeship with William Hardcastle in the area of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1832, during his time as a surgeon-apothecary apprentice, he encountered a cholera epidemic for the first time in Killingworth, a coal-mining village. Snow treated many victims of the disease and thus gained experience. Eventually he adjusted to teetotalism and led a life characterized by abstinence, signing an abstinence pledge in 1835. Snow was also a vegetarian and tried to only drink distilled water that was ‚Äúpure‚Äù. Between 1832 and 1835 Snow worked as an assistant to a colliery surgeon, first in Burnopfield, County Durham, and then in Pateley Bridge, West Riding of Yorkshire. In October 1836 he enrolled at the Hunterian school of medicine on Great Windmill Street, London.Thomas, KB. (1973) \\"John Snow\\" in Dictionary of Scientific Biography. Vol 12. New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons; pp. 502‚Äì503.  Career  In the 1830s, Snow's colleague at the Newcastle Infirmary was surgeon Thomas Michael Greenhow. The surgeons worked together conducting research on England's cholera epidemics, both continuing to do so for many years. In 1837, Snow began working at the Westminster Hospital. Admitted as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England on 2 May 1838, he graduated from the University of London in December 1844 and was admitted to the Royal College of Physicians in 1850. Snow was a founding member of the Epidemiological Society of London which was formed in May 1850 in response to the cholera outbreak of 1849. By 1856, Snow and Greenhow's nephew, Dr. E.H. Greenhow were some of a handful of esteemed medical men of the society who held discussions on this \\"dreadful scourge, the cholera\\". In 1857, Snow made an early and often overlooked contribution to epidemiology in a pamphlet, On the adulteration of bread as a cause of rickets. Reedited in  Anaesthesia  John Snow was one of the first physicians to study and calculate dosages for the use of ether and chloroform as surgical anaesthetics, allowing patients to undergo surgical and obstetric procedures without the distress and pain they would otherwise experience. He designed the apparatus to safely administer ether to the patients and also designed a mask to administer chloroform.John Snow (1813‚Äì58). sciencemuseum.org.uk He personally administered chloroform to Queen Victoria when she gave birth to the last two of her nine children, Leopold in 1853 and Beatrice in 1857 and was still not yet knighted, leading to wider public acceptance of obstetric anaesthesia. Snow published an article on ether in 1847 entitled On the Inhalation of the Vapor of Ether.Snow, John (1847) On the Inhalation of the Vapor of Ether. ph.ucla.edu A longer version entitled On Chloroform and Other Anaesthetics and Their Action and Administration was published posthumously in 1858.Snow, John (1858) On Chloroform and Other Anaesthetics and Their Action and Administration. London: John Churchill After finishing his medical studies in the University of London, he earned his MD in 1844. Snow set up his practice at 54 Frith Street in Soho as a surgeon and general practitioner. John Snow contributed to a wide range of medical concerns including anaesthesiology. He was a member of the Westminster Medical Society, an organisation dedicated to clinical and scientific demonstrations. Snow gained prestige and recognition all the while being able to experiment and pursue many of his scientific ideas. He was a speaker multiple times at the society's meetings and he also wrote and published articles. He was especially interested in patients with respiratory diseases and tested his hypothesis through animal studies. In 1841, he wrote, On Asphyxiation, and on the Resuscitation of Still-Born Children, which is an article that discusses his discoveries on the physiology of neonatal respiration, oxygen consumption and the effects of body temperature change. Therefore, his interest in anaesthesia and breathing was evident since 1841 and beginning in 1843, Snow experimented with ether to see its effects on respiration. Only a year after ether was introduced to Britain, in 1847, he published a short work titled, On the Inhalation of the Vapor of Ether, which served as a guide for its use. At the same time, he worked on various papers that reported his clinical experience with anaesthesia, noting reactions, procedures and experiments. Though he thoroughly worked with ether as an anaesthetic, he never attempted to patent it; instead, he continued to work and publish written works on his observations and research. Within two years after ether was introduced, Snow was the most accomplished anaesthetist in Britain. London's principal surgeons suddenly wanted his assistance. John Snow studied chloroform as much as he studied ether, which was introduced in 1847 by James Young Simpson, a Scottish obstetrician. He realised that chloroform was much more potent and required more attention and precision when administering it. Snow first realised this with Hannah Greener, a 15-year-old patient who died on 28 January 1848 after a surgical procedure that required the cutting of her toenail. She was administered chloroform by covering her face with a cloth dipped in the substance. However, she quickly lost pulse and died. After investigating her death and a couple of deaths that followed, he realized that chloroform had to be administered carefully and published his findings in a letter to The Lancet. = Obstetric anaesthesia = Snow's work and findings were related to both anaesthesia and the practice of childbirth. His experience with obstetric patients was extensive and used different substances including ether, amylene and chloroform to treat his patients. However, chloroform was the easiest drug to administer. He treated 77 obstetric patients with chloroform. He would apply the chloroform at the second stage of labour and controlled the amount without completely putting the patients to sleep. Once the patient was delivering the baby, they would only feel the first half of the contraction and be on the border of unconsciousness, but not fully there. Regarding administration of the anaesthetic, Snow believed that it would be safer if another person that was not the surgeon applied it. The use of chloroform as an anaesthetic for childbirth was seen as unethical by many physicians and even the Church of England. However, on 7 April 1853, Queen Victoria asked John Snow to administer chloroform during the delivery of her eighth child. He then repeated the procedure for the delivery of her daughter three years later. Medical and religious acceptance of obstetrical anaesthesia came after in the 19th century.  Cholera  Map of a later cholera outbreak in London, in 1866Legend for the map above Snow was a skeptic of the then-dominant miasma theory that stated that diseases such as cholera and bubonic plague were caused by pollution or a noxious form of \\"bad air\\". The germ theory of disease had not yet been developed, so Snow did not understand the mechanism by which the disease was transmitted. His observation of the evidence led him to discount the theory of foul air. He first published his theory in an 1849 essay, On the Mode of Communication of Cholera, followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation of the role of the water supply in the Soho epidemic of 1854. By talking to local residents (with the help of Reverend Henry Whitehead), he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now Broadwick Street). Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the Broad Street pump did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle (force rod). This action has been commonly credited as ending the outbreak, but Snow observed that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline: clusters of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854, drawn and lithographed by Charles Cheffins. Snow later used a dot map to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that homes supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company, which was taking water from sewage- polluted sections of the Thames, had a cholera rate fourteen times that of those supplied by Lambeth Waterworks Company, which obtained water from the upriver, cleaner Seething Wells. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology. Snow wrote: John Snow memorial and public house on Broadwick Street, Soho Researchers later discovered that this public well had been dug only from an old cesspit, which had begun to leak faecal bacteria. The cloth nappy of a baby, who had contracted cholera from another source, had been washed into this cesspit. Its opening was originally under a nearby house, which had been rebuilt farther away after a fire. The city had widened the street and the cesspit was lost. It was common at the time to have a cesspit under most homes. Most families tried to have their raw sewage collected and dumped in the Thames to prevent their cesspit from filling faster than the sewage could decompose into the soil. Thomas Shapter had conducted similar studies and used a point-based map for the study of cholera in Exeter, seven years before John Snow, although this did not identify the water supply problem that was later held responsible. = Political controversy = After the cholera epidemic had subsided, government officials replaced the Broad Street pump handle. They had responded only to the urgent threat posed to the population, and afterward they rejected Snow's theory. To accept his proposal would have meant indirectly accepting the fecal-oral route of disease transmission, which was too unpleasant for most of the public to contemplate.Chapelle, Frank (2005) Wellsprings. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press. p. 82. It wasn't until 1866 that William Farr, one of Snow's chief opponents, realised the validity of his diagnosis when investigating another outbreak of cholera at Bromley by Bow and issued immediate orders that unboiled water was not to be drunk. Farr denied Snow's explanation of how exactly the contaminated water spread cholera, although he did accept that water had a role in the spread of the illness. In fact, some of the statistical data that Farr collected helped promote John Snow's views. Public health officials recognise the political struggles in which reformers have often become entangled.Donaldson, L.J. and Donaldson, R.J. (2005) Essential Public Health. Radcliffe Publishing. . p. 105 During the Annual Pumphandle Lecture in England, members of the John Snow Society remove and replace a pump handle to symbolise the continuing challenges for advances in public health.  Personal life  Snow became a vegetarian at the age of 17 and was a teetotaller.Mather, J. D. (2004). 200 Years of British Hydrogeology. London: The Geological Society. p. 48. He embraced an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet by supplementing his vegetables with dairy products and eggs. On this diet he excelled at swimming. He later became a vegan. In the mid-1840s, his health deteriorated and he suffered a renal disorder which he attributed to his vegan diet so he took up meat-eating and drinking wine. He continued drinking pure water (via boiling) throughout his adult life. He never married.Snow, Stephanie J. (2004) \\"Snow, John (1813‚Äì1858)\\" in Oxford Dictionary of Biography. In 1830, Snow became a member of the temperance movement. In 1845, he became a member of York Temperance Society. After his health declined it was only about 1845 that he consumed a little wine to aid digestion. Snow lived at 18 Sackville Street, London, from 1852 to his death in 1858.JOHN SNOW'S HOMES. UCLA Department of Epidemiology, 2014. Retrieved 6 June 2014. Snow suffered a stroke while working in his London office on 10 June 1858. He was 45 years old at the time.

The spelling \\"Motuhora\\" is also used. ( is the MƒÅori name for the southern right whale.)Southern right whales/tohora: New Zealand marine mammals History Whale Island from the Kohi Point Walkway close to Whakatane. Numerous archaeological sites of both MƒÅori and European origin have been recorded, including an extensive pa (fortified earthworks) site on Pa Hill and a number of house terraces and garden sites, middens (food refuse dumps), stone tool manufacture areas and stone walls. After permanent Maori occupation ceased in the early nineteenth century, NgƒÅti Awa and T≈´hoe continued to visit the island for sea food and muttonbirds and to collect stones for hƒÅngi (underground ovens). The first European occupation came in the 1830s with an unsuccessful attempt to establish a shore-based whaling station. The venture failed without a single whale being captured. Forty years later came attempts to make money from sulphur. It was extracted and sold to a refinery in Auckland over a number of years but was of poor quality, and the venture was abandoned in 1895. The next phase of industrial activity came in 1915, when quarrying provided rock for the construction of the Whakatane harbour wall. A total of of rock was removed over five years. Local government The island is not included in the boundaries of a territorial authority council (district council) and the Minister of Local Government is its territorial authority, with support from the Department of Internal Affairs. Ecology In 1965 Moutohora was declared as a wildlife refuge, named as Moutohora Wildlife Management Reserve,Moutohora (Whale Island) Wildlife Management Reserve: Places to go in Bay of Plenty and the island was bought by the Crown in 1984. Once the goats which had been introduced to the island were eradicated, a planting programme began and 12,000 plants covering 45 species are now established. Today Moutohora is covered with a mosaic of p≈çhutukawa, mƒÅhoe, kƒÅnuka, bracken and grassland. There are 190 native and 110 introduced plant species. The island is now completely free of the goats, rats, cats and rabbits which previously devastated native plants and animals. The most significant feature of Moutohora's current fauna is the breeding colony of grey-faced petrels. Sooty shearwaters, little blue penguins, the threatened New Zealand dotterel and variable oystercatchers also breed on the island. Threatened species which are occasional visitors are the Caspian tern, the North Island kaka and New Zealand falcon. Other species present include common forest birds, captive- bred red crowned parakeets, three lizard species and fur seals. Surrounding areas hosts rich marine ecosystem including cetaceans, oceanic birds, sharks. Most common of cetaceans are smaller species such as common and bottlenose dolphins,http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/about-doc/concessions-and- permits/concessions/moutohora-research-strategy.pdf pilot whales, and killer whales while larger migratory baleen whales (southern rights and rorquals) and toothed whales including beaked whales also appear from time to time.Department of Conservation, 2016, MoutohorƒÅ (Whale Island) Wildlife Management Reserve ecological restoration plan 2014‚Äì2024 (pdf) Whale / Moutohora Island - from the North.

Forty North Island saddleback (tieke) were transferred from Cuvier Island (Repanga), off the coast of the Coromandel Peninsula, to Moutohora. This relocation followed the traditional flight made centuries ago when the Mataatua waka (canoe) was accompanied by two tieke from Repanga to Whakatane. This flight followed the drowning of the twin sons of Muriwai, sister of Toroa, the captain of the waka. The two tieke settled briefly on Moutohora before returning to Cuvier Island.

Created in 1942 by writer Otto Binder and artist Marc Swayze, the team was created as an extension of Fawcett's Captain Marvel franchise, and included Marvel's sister Mary Marvel, their friend Captain Marvel Jr., and, at various times, a number of other characters as well. Because Marvel Comics trademarked their own Captain Marvel comic book during the interim between the demise of the Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel comics in 1953 and DC's revival in 1972, DC Comics is today unable to promote and market their Captain Marvel/Marvel Family properties under those names. Since 1972, DC has instead used the trademark Shazam! for their comic book titles with the Marvel Family characters, and the name under which they market and promote the characters. When referring to the Marvel Family on comic book covers or various merchandise, they are by this legal necessity called the \\"Shazam Family\\". In 2012, DC officially changed Captain Marvel's name to Shazam, making Shazam Family the name of the superhero's associates. In current continuity, the Shazam Family comprises the superpowered alter egos of Billy Batson (teenaged alter-ego of Shazam/Captain Marvel) and his foster siblings: Mary Bromfield (formerly Mary Marvel), Freddy Freeman (formerly Captain Marvel Jr.), Darla Dudley, Pedro Pe√±a, and Eugene Choi. The Shazam Family make their cinematic debut in the DC Extended Universe film Shazam!, released in 2019 by New Line Cinema and Warner Bros.. Publication history The Marvel Family was established in 1942 after the introductions of Captain Marvel's partners, the Lieutenant Marvels (Whiz Comics #21, September 1941), Captain Marvel Jr. (Whiz Comics #25, December 1941) and Mary Marvel (Captain Marvel Adventures #18, December 1942). With Junior and Mary's additions to his adventures, Captain Marvel became the first superhero to have a team of sidekicks who share his powers, abilities, and appearance; a concept later adapted for heroes such as Superman and Aquaman, among others. The members of the Marvel Family appeared both separately and together in many of Fawcett's comic book series, including Whiz Comics, Wow Comics, Master Comics, Captain Marvel Adventures, Captain Marvel Jr., Mary Marvel, and The Marvel Family. By the late 1940s, Marvel Family comics were among the most popular in the industry, and the Marvel Family had expanded to include both non-superpowered characters (Uncle Marvel and Freckles Marvel) and even funny animals (Hoppy the Marvel Bunny). By 1953, all of these books had ceased publication, due to Superman publisher DC Comics' lawsuit against Fawcett. In 1972, DC licensed the rights to the Marvel Family characters, and began publishing them in a comic series titled Shazam!. Fawcett sold DC the rights to the characters in 1980, by which time Shazam! had been cancelled, and the Marvels had been relegated the back- up feature of World's Finest Comics, and, later, Adventure Comics. DC retconned Captain Marvel in 1986 with their Legends miniseries, establishing him as a solo hero without a team. Writer/artist Jerry Ordway resurrected the Marvel Family in 1995 with his Power of Shazam! series, establishing the team as being made up solely of Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel, Jr. Following several attempts at relaunching the Shazam! franchise during the mid-2000s, the Marvel Family was temporarily dissolved by writers Geoff Johns and Jerry Ordway in Justice Society of America (third series) #25, with only Captain Marvel Jr., now known as Shazam, retaining his powers, but from another source. In the interim, Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel continued to appear in Billy Batson and the Magic of Shazam!, an all-ages comic book series published under DC's youth-oriented Johnny DC line which ran from 2008 to 2010. Captain Marvel Jr. joined the pair towards the end of the run of Magic of Shazam!, following a brief period serving as the sidekick of the Marvels' enemy under the name Black Adam Jr. The Shazam Family was reintroduced during DC Comics' continuity-altering Flashpoint miniseries in 2011, as six kids who all spoke \\"Shazam!\\" in unison to become one superhero, Captain Thunder. In the later company-wide \\"New 52\\" reboot that followed Flashpoint, the Captain Marvel character was renamed \\"Shazam\\" and starred in a backup segment of the Justice League series (second volume) from 2012 to 2013. These backups, by writer Geoff Johns and artist Gary Frank, introduced Billy Batson/Shazam and his new Shazam Family, consisting of Billy and his five foster siblings, with whom he shares his powers. Marvel/Shazam Family members =Primary members= Billy Batson (Captain Marvel/Shazam) The \\"World's Mightiest Mortal\\", Captain Marvel is the superpowered alter-ego of Billy Batson, an orphaned boy who speaks the name of the wizard Shazam to become an adult superhero. Billy has the powers of Solomon (wisdom), Hercules (strength), Atlas (stamina), Zeus (power), Achilles (courage), and Mercury (speed); and served as the wizard Shazam's champion and herald. In the Golden Age and Bronze Age comics, Billy chose to share his powers with his sister Mary and his friend Freddy Freeman, creating the Marvel Family. Outside of the Marvel Family, Captain Marvel served briefly as a member of both the Justice League International and the Justice Society of America. After the 2011 New 52 reboot of the Shazam! characters by Geoff Johns & Gary Frank, Billy Batson is a troubled foster child who has inherited the name, powers, and seat on the council of magic of the wizard Shazam. Becoming a hero inspired the initially brash and standoffish Billy to evolve into a noble hero and leader who embraces his new foster family. As Shazam, Billy has powers and a red- uniformed appearance similar to the traditional version of Captain Marvel with the added ability to wield magic via the \\"living lightning\\" that powers him. Mary Bromfield (Mary Marvel/Lady Shazam) In traditional Shazam! stories, Mary is Billy's once-lost twin sister Mary Batson (adopted as Mary Bromfield), who found she could say the magic word \\"Shazam!\\" and become a Marvel as well. The Golden Age Mary Marvel remained a teenager in superhero form, while the modern version is transformed into an adult like her brother. The Golden Age Mary Marvel had a different set of patrons from Captain Marvel who contributed to her powers. They were Selene (grace), Hippolyte (strength), Ariadne (skill), Zephyrus (swiftness), Aurora (beauty) and Minerva (wisdom). During the 2007 and 2008 limited series Countdown to Final Crisis and Final Crisis, Mary Marvel lost her powers and gained the powers of Marvel Family foe Black Adam. She temporarily became a villain working for Darkseid and possessed by the New God Desaad. In current DC Comics continuity from 2012 on, Mary Bromfield is Billy Batson's foster sister, having run away from an abusive home at a young age and being placed in the V√°zquez home. The oldest of the Shazam kids, Mary acts as the \\"den mother\\" and conscience of the group. She shares Billy's secret, and by saying \\"Shazam!\\" she can gain a superpowered form similar to the traditional Mary Marvel in a red uniform.Shazam! (vol. 3) #1 (February 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics Freddy Freeman (Captain Marvel Jr./Shazam Jr.) In both the Golden Age and 1990s versions of the Marvel Family, Billy's friend and classmate, Freddy Freeman, was attacked and left disabled by the supervillain Captain Nazi, and was given the power to become a Marvel to save his life. Whenever he spoke Captain Marvel's name, Freddy becomes a teenage version of Captain Marvel. This created the odd problem that he could not identify himself without changing back to his regular form. During the mid-1990s, the Freddy character went by the alias CM3 (short for \\"Captain Marvel Three\\", \\"CM1\\" being Billy and \\"CM2\\" being Mary) so that he could identify himself without transforming. He was a member of the Teen Titans during the late 1990s and later, the Outsiders in the early 2000s. The 2006‚Äì2008 Trials of Shazam! mini-series featured Freddy gaining the powers of Captain Marvel as Shazam, while Billy took over for the dead wizard Shazam as Marvel. In current DC Comics continuity from 2012 on, Freddy Freeman (now a blond teenager instead of the traditional black-haired youth, though still physically disabled) is Billy Batson's foster brother, a smart-mouthed pickpocket and trickster whose parents are in prison. He shares Billy's secret and by saying \\"Shazam!\\" can gain a form similar to an adult version of the traditional Captain Marvel, Jr., in a blue uniform. Eugene Choi Eugene Choi is Billy Batson's foster brother, an intelligent, bookish teenager about his age of Asian descent with a love of technology and video games. Eugene's bookishness is offset by a competitive and impulsive nature that causes trouble for him and the others at times.Shazam! (vol. 3) #4 (May 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics Introduced in the Flashpoint miniseries, Eugene can share Billy's power by saying \\"Shazam!\\" and become an adult Shazam-powered version of himself in a silver/gray uniform. In addition to the standard Shazam power-set, Eugene has the additional power of technopathy, which allows him to talk to and control machines and technology. Pedro Pe√±a Pedro Pe√±a is Billy Batson's foster brother, an overweight teenager of Mexican descent who is around Billy's age. Introduced in the Flashpoint miniseries, Pedro can share Billy's power by saying \\"Shazam!\\" and becoming an adult Shazam-powered version of himself in a green uniform. Pedro's adult form, resembling a tall, bearded powerlifter, is a stark contrast to his personal insecurity and shyness.Shazam! (vol. 3) #5 (June 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics While the comics have yet to make any such distinction, the 2019 live-action feature film Shazam! implies that Pedro is gay or asexual. In superhuman form, Pedro has extra amounts of super-strength compared to the rest of the Shazam Family. Darla Dudley Darla Dudley is Billy Batson's foster sister, an exuberant African-American preteen who was abandoned by her parents and adopted by Billy's foster parents, the V√°squezes. Despite her hardships growing up, Darla is very openly affectionate and loving towards her foster family and virtually anyone she meets. Introduced in the Flashpoint miniseries (as a teenager the same age as the other kids), Darla can share Billy's power by saying \\"Shazam!\\" She wears a purple uniform, and her speed abilities are amplified, making her faster than the others. She is also unable to keep secrets, which proved rather difficult to overcome. =Past members= The Lieutenant Marvels The Lieutenant Marvels are three other boys named \\"Billy Batson\\" (nicknamed \\"Tall Billy\\", \\"Fat Billy\\" and \\"Hill Billy\\" ‚Äî the latter because he was from the Appalachian Mountains ‚Äî to differentiate themselves from \\"Real Billy\\", Captain Marvel) who learned that, because they also were named Billy Batson, they could draw on the power of Shazam. They vowed only to use their power if asked by Captain Marvel, and only if all three were to say the magic word, \\"SHAZAM!\\" in unison. They did not appear in Marvel Family stories between Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1985 and Flashpoint in 2011, except for a scene in The Trials of Shazam! #2 where they briefly appeared, only to lose their powers. Following DC's 2011 New 52 reboot, the Lieutenant Marvels appear as non-superpowered allies of the Marvel Family in the 2015 one-shot comic The Multiversity: Thunderworld, where they, Mister Tawny, and Uncle Marvel help defeat the Monster Society of Evil while Captain Marvel is fighting Doctor Sivana for control of the Rock of Eternity. C.C. Batson & Marilyn Batson Clarence Charles \\"C.C.\\" Batson (named after Captain Marvel co-creator Charles Clarence \\"C.C.\\" Beck) is the biological father of Billy Batson. Billy's biological parents had been alluded to in a handful of Shazam! stories published prior to 1990 under different names. The 1994 graphic novel The Power of Shazam! by Jerry Ordway introduces C.C. and his wife, Billy's mother Marilyn, and how their deaths in that Post-Crisis continuity at the hands of Theo Adam (alter-ego of Black Adam) led to Billy gaining his powers. Much emphasis is made of Captain Marvel/Shazam's almost- identical appearance to the deceased C.C. Batson.Ordway, Jerry (1994). The Power of Shazam! New York: DC Comics. In a story arc from the subsequent Power of Shazam! ongoing series (issues 24-27, 1997), Dr. Sivana sneaks into the timestream outside of the Rock of Eternity and alters the timeline so that Theo Adam never kills the Batsons.The Power of Shazam! #24-27 (March 1997-June 1997). New York, NY: DC Comics Instead, Marilyn and C.C. themselves become the heirs to Shazam's power as the Captains Marvel, while Billy and Mary remain typical, upper-middle-class teenagers. C.C. himself is employed by the Wizard Shazam and Waverider to correct the timestream by stopping Sivana from making his changes. In current DC Rebirth continuity, C.C. Batson is still alive, resembling an older Captain Marvel/Shazam with greying hair. As a younger man, C.C. had abandoned Marilyn and Billy when Billy was a toddler and become a grifter. After spending a decade in prison, C.C. returns to Philadelphia to find Billy at the Vazquezes' foster home. When he is attacked by Black Adam and the Seven Deadly Sins, Billy shares his Shazam powers with his father, making him the prophecized seventh and final member of the Shazam Family.Shazam! (vol. 3) #9 (December 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics In superhero form, C.C. Batson wears a yellow/gold costume with red trim (an inverse of the colors of Billy's costume). However, it is revealed that C.C. Batson had been possessed by Mister Mind since his prison release, who intended to uses the Shazam powers in a plot to unite the Seven Magiclands under his rule.Shazam! (vol. 3) #11 (February 2020). Burbank, CA: DC Comics. Using a spell, Shazam shrinks himself down small enough to enter his father's ear canal and battle the worm directly. Following Mind's defeat, C.C. loses his powers and is freed from Mind's control, but reveals that he has no intentions of actually reuniting with his son.Shazam! (vol. 3) #14 (September 2020). Burbank, CA: DC Comics. =Other members= These members of the Marvel Family appear in stories set in the future. *Hoppy the Marvel Bunny is a spin- off character generally confined to his own series, the pink funny animal rabbit version of Captain Marvel periodically assisted the human Marvels in their adventures. * Thunder: The star of The Power of Shazam! 1996 Annual, Thunder is the super-powered alter-ego of a young girl from the planet Binderaan, circa 9,000 A.D., named CeCe Beck (or Beck for short). An aged Captain Marvel serves as the girl's mentor the same way Shazam served as his mentor. Whenever Beck speaks the magic words \\"Captain Marvel\\", she is transformed into Thunder, an adult super-heroine. After being lost in the timestream, Thunder briefly teamed up with the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 30th century. The names \\"CeCe Beck\\" and \\"Binderaan\\" are tributes to Marvel Family creators C.C. Beck and Otto Binder. * Tanist: A teenaged male Marvel who appeared in The Power of Shazam! #1,000,000 (November 1998, part of the DC One Million event). After his mother is killed, Tanist, a disabled resident of Mercury in the 853rd century, meets the aged Captain Marvel in the Rock of Eternity. Marvel grants the boy superpowers to save his life as he had done for Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr. =Black Marvel Family members= The Black Marvel Family, a variant of the Marvel Family concept with Captain Marvel's archvillain Black Adam as the central focus, was introduced in the pages of the weekly DC comic book 52. Black Adam An older Egyptian renegade prot√©g√© of the wizard Shazam, who was the first to be granted superpowers by the wizard. Adam eventually grew to abuse his power, and became a tyrant. Shazam returned to punish Adam with either exile into deep space (in the original Fawcett Comics) or death (in the modern DC Comics). He returns to Earth (or life) after Shazam appoints Captain Marvel his new successor, and was soon established as Captain Marvel's most powerful foe in physical abilities. In later DC continuity, Black Adam joined the Justice Society of America, claiming to have reformed, later turning on the Justice Society by using some of its younger associates to help him overthrow the government of his home country Khandaq. Adam was one of the main characters in DC's 52 weekly maxi-series, which followed his attempts to establish himself as a hero, which led him to create a \\"Marvel Family\\" of his own, which included his superpowered wife Isis and his own \\"Captain Marvel Jr.\\", Osiris. In the current \\"New 52\\" continuity, Black Adam was a former Khandaqi slave in ancient times who was granted the power of Shazam along with his young nephew, whom he kills for not sharing his taste for vengeance against their enemies. Adam kills the members of Earth's Council of Wizards save for the wizard Shazam, who imprisoned him and hid magic until Adam was freed by Doctor Sivana in modern times. Isis The superheroine Isis was originally created for live-action television to star in Filmation's The Secrets of Isis TV show, a sister series for Filmation's adaptation of Shazam!. Isis teamed up with Captain Marvel on occasion in both television and comics, and briefly starred in a licensed DC comic book in the late 1970s. In 2006, DC Comics created a new, unrelated Isis and introduced her into the DC Universe. This Isis is the alter-ego of Adrianna Tomaz, originally a slave from Egypt offered to Black Adam by the terrorist group Intergang as a token to curry his favor. Although Adam dealt harshly with the slavers and kills one of them, Adrianna becomes Adam's love interest and made him a more merciful figure, and was granted a special amulet that allowed her to become the avatar of the Egyptian goddess. Adam married Isis, but her death at the hands of the Four Horsemen of Apokolips drove him to a fit of mass murder. At the end of the Black Adam: The Dark Age mini-series in 2007, Isis was resurrected by Felix Faust. However, the ordeal of her death, and many months spent as a brainwashed slave, routinely abused by Faust, left her much colder and ruthless than before, making her even less merciful than her husband. In current \\"New 52\\" continuity, Adrianna Tomaz is a peaceful freedom fighter who helps her brother Amon resurrect Black Adam after his defeat at the hands of the superhero Shazam.Justice League of America #23.4: Black Adam (2013) Osiris The teenaged Osiris is Amon Tomaz, Adrianna's long-lost brother who was kidnapped, enslaved, and crippled by Intergang. Adam shared his powers with Amon, allowing him to transform into the superpowered Osiris by saying the name \\"Black Adam\\". Osiris was murdered by his trusted companion, Sobek the talking crocodile, revealed to be Famine, one of the Four Horsemen. During the 2009-2010 crossover event Blackest Night, Osiris was resurrected alongside other heroes, and was later resurrected as a White Lantern, for the purpose of releasing Isis, for which he joins the new Titans. In current \\"New 52\\" continuity, Amon Tomaz is a rebellious freedom fighter who helps resurrect Black Adam after his defeat at the hands of the superhero Shazam. Sobek Sobek is an intelligent humanoid crocodile, created and abandoned by the Sivana Family, who befriends the Black Marvel family during the 52 maxi-series after escaping from his cage at the Sivana compound. Despite his monstrous appearance, the character is portrayed as timid, meek, and good-natured, making him the Black Marvel Family's analogue to Tawky Tawny. Sobek reveals a more horrifying side in 52 Week 43, when he convinced a distraught Osiris to change into his mortal form, then suddenly killed and devoured him. Sobek was revealed in Week 44 to be the Fourth Horseman, Famine. He appeared to have been killed by Black Adam both in self-defense and revenge, but reappears in the 52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen mini-series reincarnated as a humanoid hyena with cybernetic parts. Marvel Family allies The cover of Whiz Comics #59 (Oct. 1944), featuring most of the Golden Age Marvel Family and supporting cast. Art by C.C. Beck and Pete Costanza. =Introduced during the Golden Age (1939-1953)= * The Wizard Shazam - Although he is killed as prophesied after giving Billy the power to become Captain Marvel, Shazam's spirit remains as the vigilant caretaker of the Rock of Eternity. His power level varies in different stories from high- level magician to godlike. In the 1990s-2000s continuity, Shazam does not die after granting Billy his powers, and was a much more active character than he was during the Golden Age Marvel Family adventures. In current continuity, Shazam - known to most as only \\"The Wizard,\\" whose true name is Mamaragan - was one of the first humans on Earth to wield magic in ancient times, and becomes the head chair of the Council of Eternity. After the betrayal of Black Adam, Shazam's compatriots on the Council are murdered, and as the remaining member, he imprisons Adam and hides magic from the world. When Adam is freed by Doctor Sivana in modern times, Shazam drafts Billy Batson as his successor. * Mr. Sterling Morris - The president of Amalgamated Broadcasting, owners of Station WHIZ, the radio (and later TV) station for which Billy Batson works. He debuts in the very first Captain Marvel story in Whiz Comics #2. * Beautia and Magnificus Sivana - Dr. Sivana's beautiful adult daughter Beautia shared her father's passion for world domination until meeting, and falling for, Captain Marvel. She has an unrequited crush on the shy Captain, not realizing that he is actually only a young boy. Beautia first appeared in Whiz Comics #3b in 1940.Because of a numbering error at Fawcett Publications, there are two issues of Whiz Comics assigned the number 3. Most Golden Age Marvel Family stories feature Beautia as Dr. Sivana's unwitting assistant, who betrays her father to assist the heroes. Her older brother, Magnificus, is also generally depicted as a Marvel Family ally, although in his only Golden Age appearance (Whiz Comics #15, 1941), Magnificus was super-strong and fought Captain Marvel hand-to-hand at his father's request. * \\"Muscles\\" McGinnis - The antagonist of a story included in Captain Marvel Adventures #3 (1941), the toughest gangster of the city possessing enormous strength. \\"Muscles\\" McGinnis promises to go straight after being defeated by Captain Marvel when he tries to take over Station WHIZ, as he feels the side opposing crime is much stronger. The character was reintroduced as a recurring character in the Power of Shazam! series of the 1990s, in which \\"Muscles\\" had indeed reformed to become an undercover cop and a frequent ally of Captain Marvel. *Steamboat - In the 1940s Fawcett stories, Steamboat is Billy Batson's African-American valet. Depicted as cowardly and subservient, Steamboat accompanied Billy and Captain Marvel on many of their adventures following his first appearance in America's Greatest Comics #3 in 1941. Drawn in a racially stereotyped manner and speaking with a stereotypical Negro dialect, Steamboat was retired from the Captain Marvel stories after the Youth Builders, a diverse group of New York City and Philadelphia area students, protested the use of the character in 1945. * Cissie Sommerly - Billy Batson's girlfriend and Sterling Morris' niece. She first appears in Captain Marvel Adventures #12 (1942). * Uncle Marvel (Uncle Dudley) - During the Golden Age, an old man named Dudley claimed that he was not only a relative of the Marvels but also a Marvel himself, although neither was true. Regardless, the Marvels took a liking to him and decided to humor his pretense, and \\"Uncle\\" Dudley became Uncle Marvel, the Marvel Family's manager. He would make his \\"transformation\\" along with one or more of the others, but not by magic; rather, by quickly removing his break- away garments (under the cover of lightning that the real Marvel(s) called down) to reveal his homemade Marvel costume underneath. He explained his lack of superpowers by claiming he suffered from \\"shazambago\\". Dudley first appeared in Wow Comics #18 in 1943. In the 1990s The Power of Shazam! comics, Dudley H. Dudley is simply a janitor at Billy's school who finds himself involved in the Marvel Family's adventures, although in one story (The Power of Shazam! #11, 1996) he was temporarily given superpowers by Shazam's ally Ibis the Invincible to help round up the escaped Seven Deadly Enemies of Man]Power of Shazam! #11 (1996) * Freckles Marvel (Mary Dudley) - Uncle Dudley's adopted niece, who was an irregular companion of Mary Marvel's in her Golden Age solo adventures. First appearing in Wow Comics #35 (1945), Freckles Marvel had no superpowers of her own, but wore her own Mary Marvel costume to help her super-powered friend fight crime. * Mister Tawky Tawny - A humanoid sapient tiger who wishes to live among the humans in civilization instead of in the wild or the zoo. As such, he is typically dressed in a tweed business suit and usually carries himself in a formal, dignified manner. Tawny first appeared in Captain Marvel Adventures #79 (1947), and became Captain Marvel's sidekick and best friend. Other variants of Tawny at DC have included a version magically animated from a stuffed tiger doll (The Power of Shazam!, 1995‚Äì99), a benevolent shapeshifter who prefers to become a tiger when appropriate (Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil, 2007), and a tiger at the local zoo who is briefly given enhanced strength and size by Shazam (Shazam! backup feature in Justice League, 2013). The Tawky Tawny of the current- continuity Shazam! comics series hails from the Wildlands, one of the Seven Magiclands connected to the Rock of Eternity, where he strives to live among the other humanoid animals of that realm despite the discrimination and segregation pitted against tigers.Shazam! (vol. 3) #4 (June 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics. =Introduced in the Bronze Age (1970-1985)= * Kid Eternity - A Golden Age hero co-created by frequent Captain Marvel writer Otto Binder for Quality Comics, first appearing in Hit Comics #25 in 1945. Kid Eternity is the alter-ego of Christopher \\"Kit\\" Freeman, a boy who is killed with his grandfather by Nazi, and, upon learning he was not meant to die, is granted the power to summon any historical or mythological figure by speaking the magic word \\"Eternity!\\" In the 1970s, Kid Eternity, acquired from Quality by DC, was integrated into the Shazam! franchise set on Earth-S, with his first appearance in a new DC story being Shazam! #28 (Feb. 1977). Kid Eternity often joined forces with the Marvels in early-1980s Shazam! adventures from World's Finest Comics and Adventure Comics. In World's Finest Comics #279-280 (May‚ÄìJune 1982), Kid Eternity and Captain Marvel, Jr. learn they are long-lost brothers (a retcon made given the characters' identical surnames and similar origin stories). =Introduced after Crisis on Infinite Earths (1986-2011)= * Miss Wormwood - In the 1990s The Power of Shazam! comics, Billy's schoolteacher (and later principal), presented as the typical \\"mean teacher\\" stereotype. She is named after Calvin's schoolteacher in Bill Watterson's comic strip Calvin and Hobbes. * Nick and Nora Bromfield - In the 1990s The Power of Shazam! comics, Mary Batson's adoptive parents, who adopted her through illegal means after their maid, Sarah Primm, brought the child to them (Primm saved Mary from her kidnapper, Primm's brother Theo Adam). Nora Bromfield was a cousin of Billy and Mary's mother, but chose not to tell Mary about her real family. The Bromfields would eventually gain the rights to legally adopt both Mary and Billy, giving the children a traditional family structure again. The couple was named after Nick and Nora Charles of the Thin Man film series. =Introduced after Flashpoint (2011-present)= * Victor and Rosa Vasquez - The foster parents of the six kids in the Shazam Family; a working-class couple who had grown up as foster children themselves. The Vasquezes debuted in Geoff Johns & Gary Frank's 2012-13 reboot of Shazam! Marvel Family enemies =Key villains= Besides the Black Marvel Family, the following are among the most prominent members of the Marvel Family's rogues gallery, in order of first appearance in the comics. Doctor Sivana Dr. Thaddeus Bodog Sivana, Sr. - \\"The World's Wickedest Scientist\\" - debuted in Whiz Comics #2 alongside Billy Batson and Captain Marvel, quickly becoming his main archenemy and most frequently recurring villain. A mad scientist who fights the Marvel Family using his genius intellect and inventions, the Golden Age Sivana had been a humanitarian scientist who bitterly fled 20th-century Europe after his inventions were ridiculed by the scientific society. Living on Venus with his four children, he became a mad scientist, bent on taking over the universe.Whiz Comics #15 (May 1941). New York: Fawcett Publications. Other versions of Sivana in later DC Comics have positioned him as Billy Batson's wicked step-uncle (Shazam!: The New Beginning), a wealthy, wicked businessman driven to ruin by his entanglements with Black Adam (The Power of Shazam!), and the wicked Attorney General of the United States (Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil). The current-continuity Doctor Sivana, following the 2011 reboot, is a rich scientist determined to prove the existence of magic, which leads him to free both Black Adam and Mister Mind. Sivana acquires the ability to both see magic and project magic lightning from his right eye.Shazam! (vol. 3) #8 (December 2019). Burbank, CA: DC Comics. During the early and mid-1940s, Dr. Sivana was often assisted, under duress, by his good-natured adult daughter Beautia (and, briefly, Sivana's oldest child, his son Magnificus). From the mid-1940s onward, his youngest children - teenaged twins Thaddeus, Jr. aka Sivana, Jr, and Georgia Sivana, both dead ringers for their father - became his henchmen as the Sivana Family. Georgia Sivana became a prominent villain for Mary Marvel, as did Sivana, Jr. for Captain Marvel, Jr. The Seven Deadly Sins Originally known as the \\"Seven Deadly Enemies of Man\\" and first appearing in the Whiz Comics #2 origin story in 1940, the sins are seven powerful demons held prisoner by the Wizard Shazam in his lair. The demons, whose forms vary by era and artist, sometimes escape and cause havoc through murder and using their powers to influence sin in humans. Based upon the seven deadly sins as enumerated in Christian legend, the original \\"Seven Deadly Enemies of Man\\" were slightly censored for suitable reading for children: Pride, Envy, Greed, Hatred, Selfishness, Laziness, and Injustice. Each demon could influence their namesake sin in human victims. Beginning with DC's JSA series in the mid-2000s, the proper Christian names/versions of the sins were used: Pride, Envy, Greed, Hatred, Sloth, Gluttony, and Lust. Captain Nazi Introduced in a three-part crossover between Master Comics and Whiz Comics in 1941 during World War II, Captain Nazi - real name Albrecht Krieger - is a genetically-altered Nazi who is Adolf Hitler's champion. Wearing a green costume with a swastika insignia, Captain Nazi has super-strength, near- invulnerability, and can use a special chemical gas to fly. Created to wreak havoc on America, Captain Nazi murders an elderly man and cripples a teenage boy during his fight with Captain Marvel in Whiz Comics #25 (December 1941). The boy, Freddy Freeman, is granted powers by Captain Marvel to save his life, becoming Captain Marvel, Jr. and declaring Captain Nazi his mortal enemy. Ibac A frail thug named \\"Stinky\\" Printwhistle who was empowered by Lucifer himself after Lucifer saved Printwhistle from a fall caused by Captain Marvel. Printwistle is imbued with the powers of four of the most evil men to walk the face of the earth (Ivan the Terrible, Borgia, Attila the Hun and Caligula). When he says the name \\"IBAC\\", he is engulfed in green fire and brimstone and becomes a large, muscular brute with super-strength.Captain Marvel Adventures #8 (August 1942). New York: Fawcett Publications. Saying his name again transforms him back into Printwhistle (therefore, like Captain Marvel, Jr., Ibac also cannot say his own name). Ibac first appeared in Captain Marvel Adventures #8 in 1942 and became a recurring Marvel Family villain through the characters' run in Fawcett and DC Comics. The 2011 rebooted version of Ibac is the descendant of a long line of evil despots, the first of whom - Ibac the Terrible - was known in ancient times as \\"the man who invented evil.\\"Justice League (vol. 3) #19 (June 2013). Burbank, CA: DC Comics. Sabbac Similar to Ibac, Timothy Karnes is granted the powers of six demons when he says the magic word \\"Sabbac\\". As opposed to fire, Sabbac transforms via black lightning cast up (rather than down) from Hades. First appearing in Captain Marvel Jr. #4 (February 1943), Sabbac's pantheon - - grant him powers similar to the Marvel Family, with the added power of pyrokenesis. A second Ibac, Ishamel Gregor, was introduced in the mid-2000s in the Outsiders comic book. While Karnes' Sabbac became a more muscular version of himself in a green cloak with demon fangs, Gregor's Sabbac is a large, muscular, horned demon with red skin and hair. In the 2011 Shazam! reboot, the Seven Deadly Sins have the power to possess a wicked human and transform him into a fifty-foot tall demon resembling the Ishamel Gregor version of Sabbac.Justice League (vol. 3) #21 (August 2013). Burbank, CA: DC Comics. Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil First appearing in Captain Marvel Adventures #22 (1943) as a disembodied voice, and later in issue #26 in his actual form, Mister Mind - \\"The World's Wickedest Worm\\" - is an evil alien caterpillar with genius intellect. Given his small stature, he wears a talkbox to communicate and is often depicted wearing eyeglasses as well. He runs the supervillain team called he Monster Society of Evil, whose membership includes most of the Marvel Family's key and recurring villains, including characters such as Doctor Sivana, King Kull, the Crocodile-Men, Captain Nazi, Mister Atom, Ibac, Jeepers, and Oggar. Mister Mind's own powers have included mind control (typically by crawling into a host's ear),The Power of Shazam! #13 (March 1996). New York, NY: DC Comics.JSA #58 (April 2004).

There have been several designs of this driver. The current one splits it in two portions: DIX (Device-Independent X) and DDX (Device-Dependent X) Glamor will simplify the X server, and could use the libDRM of the radeon open-source driver instead of the proprietary binary blob. Rendering calculations are outsourced over OpenGL to the GPU to be done in real-time. The DRI regulates access and book-keeping. The Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) is a framework for allowing direct access to graphics hardware under the X Window System in a safe, efficient way. The main use of DRI is to provide hardware acceleration for the Mesa implementation of OpenGL. DRI has also been adapted to provide OpenGL acceleration on a framebuffer console without a display server running. DRI implementation is scattered through the X Server and its associated client libraries, Mesa 3D and the Direct Rendering Manager kernel subsystem. All of its source code is free software.  Overview  In the classic X Window System architecture the X Server is the only process with exclusive access to the graphics hardware, and therefore the one which does the actual rendering on the framebuffer. All that X clients do is communicate with the X Server to dispatch rendering commands. Those commands are hardware independent, meaning that the X11 protocol provides an API that abstracts the graphics device so the X clients don't need to know or worry about the specifics of the underlying hardware. Any hardware specific code lives inside the Device Dependent X, the part of the X Server that manages each type of video card or graphics adapter and which is also often called the video or graphics driver. The rise of 3D rendering has shown the limits of this architecture. 3D graphics applications tend to produce large amounts of commands and data, all of which must be dispatched to the X Server for rendering. As the amount of inter-process communication (IPC) between the X client and X Server increased, the 3D rendering performance suffered to the point that X driver developers concluded that in order to take advantage of 3D hardware capabilities of the latest graphics cards a new IPC- less architecture was required. X clients should have direct access to graphics hardware rather than relying on a third party process to do so, saving all the IPC overhead. This approach is called \\"direct rendering\\" as opposed to the \\"indirect rendering\\" provided by the classical X architecture. The Direct Rendering Infrastructure was initially developed to allow any X client to perform 3D rendering using this \\"direct rendering\\" approach. Nothing prevents DRI from being used to implement accelerated 2D direct rendering within an X client. Simply no one has had the need to do so because the 2D indirect rendering performance was good enough.  Software architecture  The basic architecture of the Direct Rendering Infrastructure involves three main components: * the DRI client --an X client performing \\"direct rendering\\"-- needs a hardware specific \\"driver\\" able to manage the current video card or graphics adapter in order to render on it. These DRI drivers are typically provided as shared libraries to which the client is dynamically linked. Since DRI was conceived to take advantage of 3D graphics hardware, the libraries are normally presented to clients as hardware accelerated implementations of a 3D API such as OpenGL, provided by either the 3D hardware vendor itself or a third party such as the Mesa 3D free software project. * the X Server provides an X11 protocol extension --the DRI extension-- that the DRI clients use to coordinate with both the windowing system and the DDX driver. As part of the DDX driver, it's quite common that the X Server process also dynamically links to the same DRI driver that the DRI clients, but to provide hardware accelerated 3D rendering to the X clients using the GLX extension for indirect rendering (for example remote X clients that can't use direct rendering). For 2D rendering, the DDX driver must also take into account the DRI clients using the same graphics device. * the access to the video card or graphics adapter is regulated by a kernel component called the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM). Both the X Server's DDX driver and each X client's DRI driver must use DRM to access to the graphics hardware. DRM provides synchronization to the shared resources of the graphics hardware --resources such as the command queue, the card registers, the video memory, the DMA engines, ...-- ensuring that the concurrent access of all those multiple competing user space processes don't interfere with each other. DRM also serves as a basic security enforcer that doesn't allow any X client to access the hardware beyond what it needs to perform the 3D rendering.  DRI1  In the original DRI architecture, due to the memory size of video cards at that time, there was a single instance of the screen front buffer and back buffer (also of the ancillary depth buffer and stencil buffer), shared by all the DRI clients and the X Server. All of them rendered directly onto the back buffer, that was swapped with the front buffer at vertical blanking interval time. In order to render to the back buffer, a DRI process should ensure that the rendering was clipped to the area reserved for its window. The synchronization with the X Server was done through signals and a shared memory buffer called the SAREA. The access to the DRM device was exclusive, so any DRI client had to lock it at the beginning of a rendering operation. Other users of the device --including the X Server-- were blocked in the meantime, and they had to wait until the lock was released at the end of the current rendering operation, even if it wouldn't be any conflict between both operations. Another drawback was that operations didn't retain memory allocations after the current DRI process released its lock on the device, so any data uploaded to the graphics memory such as textures were lost for upcoming operations, causing a significant impact on graphics performance. Nowadays DRI1 is considered completely obsolete and must not be used.  DRI2  Due to the increasing popularity of compositing window managers like Compiz, the Direct Rendering Infrastructure had to be redesigned so that X clients could also support redirection to \\"offscreen pixmaps\\" while doing direct rendering. Regular X clients already respected the redirection to a separate pixmap provided by the X Server as a render target --the so-called offscreen pixmap--, but DRI clients continued to do the rendering directly into the shared backbuffer, effectively bypassing the compositing window manager. The ultimate solution was to change the way DRI handled the render buffers, which led to a completely different DRI extension with a new set of operations, and also major changes in the Direct Rendering Manager. The new extension was named \\"DRI2\\", although it's not a later version but a different extension not even compatible with the original DRI --in fact both have coexisted within the X Server for a long time. In DRI2, instead of a single shared (back) buffer, every DRI client gets its own private back buffer --along with their associated depth and stencil buffers-- to render its window content using the hardware acceleration. The DRI client then swaps it with a false \\"front buffer\\", which is used by the compositing window manager as one of the sources to compose (build) the final screen back buffer to be swapped at the VBLANK interval with the real front buffer. To handle all these new buffers, the Direct Rendering Manager had to incorporate new functionality, specifically a graphics memory manager. DRI2 was initially developed using the experimental TTM memory manager, but it was later rewritten to use GEM after it was chosen as the definitive DRM memory manager. The new DRI2 internal buffer management model also solved two major performance bottlenecks present in the original DRI implementation: * DRI2 clients no longer lock the entire DRM device while using it for rendering, since now each client gets a separate render buffer independent from the other processes. * DRI2 clients can allocate their own buffers (with textures, vertex lists, ...) in the video memory and keep them as long as they want, which significantly reduces video memory bandwidth consumption. In DRI2, the allocation of the private offscreen buffers (back buffer, fake front buffer, depth buffer, stencil buffer, ...) for a window is done by the X Server itself. DRI clients retrieve those buffers to do the rendering into the window by calling operations such as and available in the DRI2 extension. Internally, DRI2 uses GEM names --a type of global handle provided by the GEM API that allows two processes accessing a DRM device to refer to the same buffer-- for passing around \\"references\\" to those buffers through the X11 protocol. The reason why the X Server is in charge of the buffer allocation of the render buffers of a window is that the GLX extension allows for multiple X clients to do OpenGL rendering cooperatively in the same window. This way, the X Server manages the whole lifecycle of the render buffers along the entire rendering process and knows when it can safely recycle or discard them. When a window resize is performed, the X Server is also responsible for allocating new render buffers matching the new window size, and notifying the change to the DRI client(s) rendering into the window using an InvalidateBuffers event, so they would retrieve the GEM names of the new buffers. The DRI2 extension provides other core operations for the DRI clients, such as finding out which DRM device and driver should they use () or getting authenticated by the X Server in order to be able to use the rendering and buffer facilities of the DRM device (). The presentation of the rendered buffers in the screen is performed using the and requests. can be used to do a copy between the fake front buffer and the real front buffer, but it doesn't provide any synchronization with the vertical blanking interval, so it can cause tearing. , on the other hand, performs a VBLANK-synchronized swap between back and front buffer, if it's supported and both buffers have the same size, or a copy (blit) otherwise.  DRI3  Although DRI2 was a significant improvement over the original DRI, the new extension also introduced some new issues. In 2013, a third iteration of the Direct Rendering Infrastructure known as DRI3 was developed in order to fix those issues. The main differences of DRI3 compared to DRI2 are: * DRI3 clients allocate themselves their render buffers instead of relying on the X Server for doing the allocation --that was the method supported by DRI2. * DRI3 gets rid of the old insecure GEM buffer sharing mechanism based on GEM names (global GEM handles) for passing buffer objects between a DRI client and the X Server in favor of the one more secure and versatile based on PRIME DMA- BUFs, which uses file descriptors instead. Buffer allocation on the client side breaks GLX assumptions in the sense that it's no longer possible for multiple GLX applications to render cooperatively in the same window. On the plus side, the fact that the DRI client is in charge of its own buffers throughout their lifetime brings many advantages. For example, it is easy for the DRI3 client to ensure that the size of the render buffers always match the current size of the window, and thereby eliminate the artifacts due to the lack of synchronization of buffer sizes between client and server that plagued window resizing in DRI2. A better performance is also achieved because now DRI3 clients save the extra round trip waiting for the X Server to send the render buffers. DRI3 clients, and especially compositor window managers, can take advantage of keeping older buffers of previous frames and reusing them as the basis on which to render only the damaged parts of a window as another performance optimization. The DRI3 extension no longer needs to be modified to support new particular buffer formats, since they are now handled directly between the DRI client driver and the DRM kernel driver. The use of file descriptors, on the other hand, allows the kernel to perform a safe cleanup of any unused GEM buffer object --one with no reference to it. Technically, DRI3 consists of two different extensions, the \\"DRI3\\" extension and the \\"Present\\" extension. The main purpose of the DRI3 extension is to implement the mechanism to share direct rendered buffers between DRI clients and the X Server. DRI clients allocate and use GEM buffers objects as rendering targets, while the X Server represents these render buffers using a type of X11 object called \\"pixmap\\". DRI3 provides two operations, and , one to create a pixmap (in \\"X Server space\\") from a GEM buffer object (in \\"DRI client space\\"), and the other to do the reverse and get a GEM buffer object from an X pixmap. In these DRI3 operations GEM buffer objects are passed as DMA-BUF file descriptors instead of GEM names. DRI3 also provides a way to share synchronization objects between the DRI client and the X Server, allowing both a serialized access to the shared buffer. Unlike DRI2, the initial operation --the first every DRI client must request to know which DRM device to use-- returns an already open file descriptor to the device node instead of the device node filename, with any required authentication procedure already performed in advance by the X Server. DRI3 provides no mechanism to show the rendered buffers on the screen, but relies on another extension, the Present extension, to do so. Present is so named because its main task is to \\"present\\" buffers on the screen, meaning that it handles the update of the framebuffer using the contents of the rendered buffers delivered by client applications. Screen updates have to be done at the proper time, normally during the VBLANK interval in order to avoid display artifacts such as tearing. Present also handles the synchronization of screen updates to the VBLANK interval. It also keeps the X client informed about the instant each buffer is really shown on the screen using events, so the client can synchronize its rendering process with the current screen refresh rate. Present accepts any X pixmap as the source for a screen update. Since pixmaps are standard X objects, Present can be used not only by DRI3 clients performing direct rendering, but also by any X client rendering on a pixmap by any means. For example, most existing non-GL based GTK+ and Qt applications used to do double buffered pixmap rendering using XRender. The Present extension can also be used by these applications to achieve efficient and non-tearing screen updates. This is the reason why Present was developed as a separate standalone extension instead of being part of DRI3. Apart from allowing non-GL X clients to synchronize with VBLANK, Present brings other advantages. DRI3 graphics performance is better because Present is more efficient than DRI2 in swapping buffers. A number of OpenGL extensions that weren't available with DRI2 are now supported based on new features provided by Present. Present provides two main operations to X clients: update a region of a window using part of or all the contents of a pixmap () and set the type of presentation events related to a certain window that the client wants to be notified about (). There are three presentation events about which a window can notify an X client: when an ongoing presentation operation --normally from a call to -- has been completed (), when a pixmap used by a operation is ready to be reused () and when the window configuration --mostly window size-- changes (). Whether a operation performs a direct copy (blit) onto the front buffer or a swap of the entire back buffer with the front buffer is an internal detail of the Present extension implementation, instead of an explicit choice of the X client as it was in DRI2.  Adoption  Several open source DRI drivers have been written, including ones for ATI Mach64, ATI Rage128, ATI Radeon, 3dfx Voodoo3 through Voodoo5, Matrox G200 through G400, SiS 300-series, Intel i810 through i965, S3 Savage, VIA UniChrome graphics chipsets, and nouveau for Nvidia. Some graphics vendors have written closed-source DRI drivers, including ATI and Kyro. The various versions of DRI have been implemented by various operating systems, amongst others by the Linux kernel, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and OpenSolaris.  History  The project was started by Jens Owen and Kevin E. Martin from Precision Insight (funded by Silicon Graphics and Red Hat). It was first made widely available as part of XFree86 4.0 and is now part of the X.Org Server. It is currently maintained by the free software community. Work on DRI2 started at the 2007 X Developers' Summit from a Kristian H√∏gsberg's proposal. H√∏gsberg himself wrote the new DRI2 extension and the modifications to Mesa and GLX. In March 2008 DRI2 was mostly done, but it couldn't make into X.Org Server version 1.5 and had to wait until version 1.6 from February 2009. The DRI2 extension was officially included in the X11R7.5 release of October 2009. The first public version of the DRI2 protocol (2.0) was announced in April 2009. Since then there has been several revisions, being the most recent the version 2.8 from July 2012. Due to several limitations of DRI2, a new extension called DRI-Next was proposed by Keith Packard and Eric Anholt at the X.Org Developer's Conference 2012. The extension was proposed again as DRI3000 at Linux.conf.au 2013. DRI3 and Present extensions were developed during 2013 and merged into the X.Org Server 1.15 release from December 2013. The first and only version of the DRI3 protocol (1.0) was released in November 2013.

The village is part of Luddendenfoot Ward of Calderdale Council. History =Early days= There is evidence of human activity on the Yorkshire moors around Cragg from c. 10,000 BC. Flints, not native to West Yorkshire, have been found on Blackstone and Midgley Moors ‚Äì implying movement of peoples and long distance trade by this period at the latest. Later flint spear heads and arrow tips, hunting weapons, have been found in quantity over Manshead and Rishworth moors. So we know Mesolithic tribes hunted around both the Turvin and Cragg areas. Hunters were constrained to move across the high reaches, which were less heavily wooded, rather than the steep sided valleys ‚Äì but to cross from top to top they must descend to ford the streams and rivers of the valley bottoms. Although prehistoric and later peoples were responsible for extensive tree felling and land clearance this did not create the peat moors above Cragg Vale. Around 5000 BC the climate changed and became much wetter and remained so for over 2,000 years. Soil deteriorated as minerals were washed away, and the land around Cragg became waterlogged. The trees and plant life died away and the peat moors on the tops were created. We know from place naming and language conventions that ancient Britons (the Brigantes tribe), Anglo Saxons, Vikings, and Romans had a large input into the area of Cragg. =Romans= The Romans left little except their (disputed) road over Blackstone Edge as evidence ‚Äì but there would have been extensive forced population relocation as the engineers and troops pushed forwards. We know the Romans made a pact with the Brigantes tribe, and that this whole area of West Yorkshire ‚Äì the centre of the ancient kingdom of Elmet ‚Äì was ruled by them. Little remains of Elmet but the ancient names. Close by Cragg lies the hamlet of Warley, and not much further away to the west lies Walsden ‚Äì both names relate to the 'Walh' ‚Äì a term used for the Britons. This implies a residual British culture after the invasion and takeover by the victorious Anglo Saxons The Britons were annexed by the Romans by 100 AD, and c. 700 AD the Saxons arrived. Around 1000 AD, the Vikings gained control. They in turn were overcome by the Normans by 1100 AD. Leading into the Medieval period The primary industry was agriculture, but iron was smelted too, good timber and charcoal was produced, and grain was milled. Local craftsmen produce some cloth, make clothing, farm implements, and utensils while others provide transport services and labour. Cragg was part of a township called Cruttonstall (later called Erringden) and adjacent to the township of Sowerby (Sorebi from the Norse). All the land between Cragg and Sowerby was gradually cleared of dense forest to make way for agriculture as the population grew. The land to the West, and a large part of Cragg Vale, was soon to be partly cleared and 'impaled' as a huge deer park and royal hunting ground. =Medieval= In late Medieval times the deer park fell into disrepair and was finally dispaled. Knights no longer took the rough ride down The Withens toward Wakefield tourney. The wild boars, stags and wolves were in serious decline and sheep were now the major local industry. =18th and 19th century= During the late 18th century, the area was the home of a band of counterfeiters known as the Cragg Coiners. Having a good supply of water from the moors, Cragg was always a likely home for industry based on water power. From mid-1700 onwards, water then steam power, and combined water wheel and steam engines dominated the valley with the cloth mills. There were a number of families involved in mill ownership during this time. Sutcliffes, Greenwoods, and Hinchliffes amongst others. Yet in 1758 there were but 3 mills in Cragg. A paper mill (just up from and on the opposite side of the main roadB6138 the Robin Hood Inn),The Revd John Watson History & Antiquities of the Parish of Halifax in Yorkshire illustrations by William Williams.

At the time of first publication, Cragg Vale would have been part of the ecclesiastical Parish of Halifax. a corn mill (at Hoo Hole), and a mill for fulling woven cloth from the farms. The water driven mills that flourished at Turvin, Marshaw Village (by the Hinchliffe Arms pub) and on Elphin Brook (down Cragg Vale) posed no real threat to local farm based weavers at that time. However, from 1808 onwards things began to change alarmingly for the worse. Steam power was heavily adopted from around 1805 on. Child labour became the norm. Now began the mill owners infamous abuses. At one time or another from 1740 to the early 20th century there have existed around 11 mills in Cragg. Turvin, Victoria, and Pepper Bank mills on Turvin Brook;Also known as Cragg Brook Marshaw (opposite the Hinchliffe Arms) with New and Vale mills in Withens Clough. Next down Elphin Brook were Castle, Paper (opposite the Robin Hood Inn), Cragg, Hoo Hole, and Scar Bottom mill (Mytholmroyd). By the 1820s these were said to be no place for \\"any decent human, let alone the children of the poor\\".Often cited on websites without source. It is on record that children died at their work in the mills of Cragg. Died from long hours and harsh treatments handed out.

Current day Although Cragg Vale is a small linear village, it has two pubs The Robin Hood Inn and the Hinchliffe Arms, as well as Cragg Vale J and I school and a Caravan park. In the last few years the village has expanded with a children's nursery called The Ark, a recording studio Aspire Technology and an online fancy dress retailer Atlantis Fancy Dress being added to the village. One of the businesses to launch most recently is Preserve Shop, a retailer of jam jars, jam making equipment and kitchenware for home preserving. The main business areas in Cragg Vale are the Top Land Country Business Park, as well as the Craggs Country Business Park further up the valley. Local enterprises include The Little Valley Brewery which produces such locally named brews as Cragg Vale Bitter, Stoodley Stout, Hebdens Wheat & Tod's Blonde among others, Zikodrive Motor Controllers, Visiosound and Vocation Brewery. Today, Cragg Vale has a population of about 650. It is located at the start of arguably the longest continuous gradient in England (after perhaps Pishill in The Chilterns)- 968 feet over 5.5 milesCragg Vale Sign There is an annual bike race up it; this is a hill climb and normally run by the Yorkshire road club.

A saddle about deep separates it from the North Island, while the other side of the volcano rises from the seafloor some beneath the waves.New Zealand Hydrographic Chart Number 541: Mayor Island to Town Point (Okurei Point), Land Information New Zealand. Retrieved 29 April 2009. The island is believed to have risen from the sea about 7000 years ago. Hot springs abound, and there are two small crater lakes, Green Lake and Black Lake. These lie within two overlapping calderas formed in explosive eruptions 36,000 and 6,340 years ago. Mayor Island has exhibited a wide range of eruptive styles, including fire fountains, Strombolian explosions, extrusion of lava domes, phreatomagmatic explosions, Plinian falls and ignimbrite. The most recent lava flows have been dated at between 500 and 1,000 years old. The island is considered special by MƒÅori (the indigenous people of New Zealand) partly because of the presence of black obsidian, a volcanic glass created by the rapid cooling of silica-rich lava, prized as a cutting tool. The obsidian was called Tuhua by MƒÅori who called the island by the same name. Captain James Cook called it Mayor Island when he sighted it on 3 November 1769, in recognition of the Lord Mayor's Day to be held in London a few days later. The area of the Bay of Plenty around the island is renowned for game fishing, with marlin, mako sharks, and swordfish all inhabiting the surrounding waters. The island and the waters close to its shores, however, are now a small marine reserve. There are several tramping tracks around the island, and it is also popular with divers. Several pa sites are known on the island, which was inhabited until 1901. Mayor Island today is a wildlife refuge.

It operates along most of the length of the former Wallingford branch of the Great Western Railway (GWR), from Cholsey station, north of Reading on the Great Western Main Line, to a station on the outskirts of the nearby town of Wallingford. History Platform level at Cholsey station, with the terminus of the Cholsey and Wallingford line to the left The first proposals for the Cholsey to Wallingford line date from 1861, and envisaged an independently owned route from Cholsey to Princes Risborough via Wallingford, Benson, Watlington and Chinnor. This line would have been a through route, with junctions with the Great Western Railway at Cholsey and the Wycombe Railway at Princes Risborough. In 1862, a Bill was presented to Parliament for a short branch from Cholsey to Wallingford, but this was withdrawn early in 1863, before it had come up for consideration. It was replaced by the Wallingford and Watlington Railway Bill which was passed by Parliament in July 1864. The W&WR; opened as far as Wallingford on 2 July 1866.In An Illustrated History of the Wallingford Branch, Karau and Turner say Monday, 7 July 1866, as does Jenkins in Oxfordshire Railways Through Time, but this includes a calendar error and is contradicted by contemporary press reports in Jacksons Oxford Journal, referenced below, London Evening Standard and Oxford Times.Jacksons Oxford Journal, Saturday, 7 July 1866 Unfortunately, two months earlier, in May 1866, the Overend, Gurney & Co bank had crashed, causing the severest financial crisis of the nineteenth century. The Bank Rate was raised to 10%, making it impossible for the W&WR; to raise the capital for its planned continuation to Watlington. In 1871, Parliament consented to the railway abandoning its plans for the line beyond Wallingford. The company was sold to the GWR in 1872. The railway became popularly known as the Wallingford Bunk. The Curator of the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway Museum attributes the following story to the late Mrs Harold Gale. \\"Around the turn of the century, the loco did a 'bunk'. It left Cholsey station without its coaches. Harold and Len Gale, returning from football in Reading, had uncoupled the loco while it waited in the bay platform.\\" The line closed to passengers in 1959, and the last British Rail goods traffic into the old Wallingford Station ran in 1965. However most of the line was retained to serve the maltings adjacent to the railway to the south of Hithercroft Road, Wallingford. Rail service to this plant ceased in 1981 when BR removed the junction at Cholsey. The Cholsey and Wallingford Railway Preservation Society was then formed to conserve the line for tourist services. It first ran train rides for the public in 1985, with regular advertised services over the full available length of the line beginning in 1997. Steam traction has also been reintroduced. Services Most services on the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway are currently hauled by the resident diesel locomotives with visiting steam locomotives for special events. Trains run on weekends and bank holidays between April and September, and at Halloween and Christmas. The railway's web site has details of operating days (see External Links below). The original branch platform at Cholsey station is now used by the CWR, and trains connect there with Great Western Railway stopping services on the Great Western Main Line between Reading and Didcot stations. The original Wallingford railway station and the last segment of the line have long been built on, and the old station site is now crossed by Beeching Way. The line now terminates at a makeshift station which is the railway's headquarters on Hithercroft Road (formerly known as Old Moor Lane). The new station is adjacent to the site of the maltings that kept the line alive into the preservation era. The maltings were demolished early in the new millennium and replaced by housing, releasing some extra land to the railway. The CWR plans to build a permanent station when resources are available. Rolling stock =Locomotives= The line is the home to several diesel locomotives, including three of British Rail's ubiquitous Class 08 shunters, which are used on most trains.

Qadir is widely regarded as the best leg spinner of the 1970s and 1980s and was a role model for up and coming leg spinners. Later he was a commentator and Chief Selector of the Pakistan Cricket Board, from which he resigned due to differences of opinion with leading Pakistan cricket administrators. Qadir appeared in 67 Test and 104 One Day International (ODI) matches between 1977 and 1993, and captained the Pakistan cricket team in five ODIs. In Test cricket, his best performance for a series was 30 wickets for 437 runs, in three Test matches at home, against England in 1987. His best bowling figures for an innings were nine wickets for 56 against the same team at the Gaddafi Stadium in the same series in 1987. In ODIs, his best bowling figures were five wickets for 44 runs against Sri Lanka during the 1983 Cricket World Cup. He was a member of the Pakistani team in the 1983 and 1987 Cricket World Cups. Yahoo! Cricket described Qadir as \\"a master of the leg-spin\\" who \\"mastered the googlies, the flippers, the leg- breaks and the topspins.\\" He is widely regarded as a top spin bowler of his generation and was included in Richie Benaud's Greatest XI shortlist of an imaginary cricket team from the best players available from all countries and eras. Former English captain Graham Gooch said that \\"Qadir was even finer than Shane Warne\\". First-class career Qadir played first-class cricket for Lahore, Punjab and Habib Bank Limited cricket teams during 1975‚Äì95. During his first-class career, he achieved five or more wickets in an innings on seventy- five occasions, and ten or more wickets in a match twenty-one times. He also scored two centuries and eight half centuries in first-class cricket. Qadir made his debut for Habib Bank against United Bank Limited at the National Stadium during the 1975‚Äì76 season. He took seven wickets in the match conceding 93 runs, including six wickets for 67 runs in the first innings. Playing for Lahore C, he took six for 17 against Bahawalpur, his best bowling figures of the season. Qadir played 209 first-class matches and took 960 wickets with an average of 23.24. His best bowling figures for an innings were nine wickets for 56 runs, whereas his best performance for a match was 13 wickets for 101 runs. As a batsman, he scored 3,740 runs averaged 18.33 from 247 innings. He also scored two centuries and eight fifties. Qadir's highest score in the format was 112 runs. In November 1989, in a warm up match played before the first Test at the National Stadium, 16-year-old Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar hit four consecutive sixes over Qadir. Later on the same day, Qadir predicted that Tendulkar would become one of the greatest batsmen. Qadir played his last first-class match in 1994. International career =Test career= Natural talent combined with aggression and passion made Qadir one of the most successful spinners of his era. He had a distinct run-up, bounding in to the crease, and a great variety of deliveries: there was the orthodox leg-break, the topspinner, two googlies and the flipper. He was unique for bowling leg spin at a time when it was not only rare but considered obsolete, and he kept the torch alight for a generation of leg spinners. His fervent appeals made him a great favourite with the spectators but sometimes got him into trouble with umpires. Qadir played 67 Test matches during 1977‚Äì90 and took 236 wickets, with an average of 32.80, including 15 five-wicket hauls. His best bowling performance was against England at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore in 1987. He also scored 1,029 runs including three fifties. Qadir showed promise from his very first Test series, bowling along with left-arm spinner Iqbal Qasim, with Wisden Almanack describing him as ‚Äúthe most notable discovery of his type for some time.‚Äù He made his Test debut against England at his home ground, Gaddafi Stadium, on 14 December 1977. His leg-breaks and googlies both caused problems for the English batsmen, but he was only able to take one wicket and his length began to falter late in the innings, forcing Pakistan to take the new ball and bowl their fast bowlers instead. He was far more successful in the second Test match. He took 6 wickets for 44 runs in 24 overs, bowling around the wicket into the footmarks of English fast bowler Bob Willis, giving him the best bowling figures for a Pakistan bowler against England. After taking five wickets in the third and final Test match, he finished as the leading wicket-taker for the series with 12 wickets at an average of 25.41. Qadir's second Test series, in England in 1978, was an injury-plagued let-down, but he was a strong and established force by his return in 1982, when his six wickets in the Lord's Test played a major role in a historic Pakistani victory. He took ten wickets in the series with an average of 40.60. Qadir's first significant performance came in the 1982‚Äì83 series against Australia, taking seven wickets for 156 runs and 11 wickets for 218 runs in the first two Test matches‚Äîman of the match in both the matches. He accumulated 22 wickets‚ÄîPakistani record against Australia‚Äîconceding 562 runs and with the average of 25.54 in the three-Test series. Due to his performance with the ball, he won the man of the series award for first time in his Test career. Pakistan clean-swept the series, winning the first and the third Test by nine wickets each, and the second Test by an innings and three runs. Qadir took 19 wickets for 451 runs with the help of three five-wicket hauls in following home series against England. Pakistan recorded their first series win against England. In the 1985‚Äì86 home series against Sri Lanka, he took six wickets in the third match at Karachi. At the Kennington Oval in 1987, Qadir's ten-wicket haul ensured another series win, this time in England. Three months later, Qadir brought his art to an all new level ‚Äì in the next home series against the same team ‚Äì taking 30 wickets for 437 runs in three Tests including the best bowling figures in an innings by a Pakistani, nine wickets for 56 runs at the Gaddafi Stadium. This is also the seventh best performance for an innings in Test cricket, and the best by any bowler against England. He achieved his career best performance in an innings, 61 runs, at the National Stadium, Karachi. Qadir's tremendous performance earned him another man of the series award, and Pakistan won another series against England. During this crusade, he moved past the 200-wicket mark, becoming the first man from his country ever to do so. Qadir was ineffective against India in the 1989‚Äì90 home series, taking only six wickets from four Tests with an average above 57. He played his last Test against the West Indies in December 1990 at the Gaddafi Stadium. =One Day International career= Qadir made his ODI debut against New Zealand at Edgbaston during 1983 Cricket World Cup; he took four wickets for 21 runs in 12 overs, earning him the man of the match award. He took 12 wickets for 264 runs in the tournament with an average of 22.00, including a five-wicket haul against Sri Lanka at Headingley, Leeds. In the 1983‚Äì84 World Series Cup, Qadir played eight matches and took 15 wickets at the average of 18.13, including five wickets for 53 against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, a match Pakistan lost by 43 runs. In the 1985‚Äì86 home season, he took six wickets against Sri Lanka, and five wickets against the West Indies including four wickets for 17 runs at the Gaddafi Stadium. Qadir's eight wickets in six matches were the second highest figures against India in 1986‚Äì87. Sachin Tendulkar played him smoothly in his first Test series for India, and it may have been his attacking batting which cut short Qadir's Test career. Qadir captained the Pakistan cricket team during England's tour to Pakistan, losing all the three matches; he topped the list of highest wicket takers during the 1987‚Äì88 series between the teams, with eight wickets at the average of 13.17. He took six wickets during the 1988‚Äì89 Wills Asia Cup at the average of 17.00, including three wickets for 27 runs, against India in the fifth match at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka. During the Nehru Cup in 1989‚Äì90, he was second in the list of leading wicket takers, with 12 wicket from seven matches at the average of 21.75. His best figure in a match during the tournament were three wickets for 27 runs, against Australia at the Brabourne Stadium, Bombay. Qadir played his last ODI against Sri Lanka at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in 1993. In total, Qadir played 104 ODIs during 1977‚Äì93, taking 132 wickets and averaged 26.16. He also took two five-wicket hauls, including his best ODI performance of five wickets for 44 runs against Sri Lanka during the 1983 World Cup. He scored 641 runs in ODIs, and his highest score in this format of the game was 41 not out. Captaincy Qadir was not successful as a captain. He captained the Pakistan cricket team in five Test matches during 1987‚Äì88 and 1988‚Äì89, losing four of them. He captained Pakistan for the first time against England, in the absence of regular captain, Javed Miandad. The three matches he captained in, against the same team, were lost by Pakistan. In ODI matches, Qadir captained Pakistan against Bangladesh and India in the fourth and fifth match of the 1988 Asia Cup respectively; Pakistan defeated Bangladesh by 173 runs, and lost to India by four wickets. As chief selector Abdul Qadir replaced Saleem Jaffar, former Pakistan fast bowler, as chief selector in November 2008 for the series against India. A series of three Tests, five ODIs and three T20Is was scheduled to be hosted by Pakistan; the series could not take place due to the deterioration of both countries' diplomatic relationship after the 2008 Mumbai attacks. His next assignment was team selection for the home series against Sri Lanka; the tour was arranged as a replacement for the scheduled tour of India which was cancelled by BCCI. The series was abandoned following an attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore during the second Test between the teams. Qadir resigned from the post in June 2009 without explaining any concern. Controversy Talking with Hasan Jalil at Pakistan Television (PTV) show in 2004, Qadir said: \\"We all know the ball has always been made up [tampered with] by Pakistani fast bowlers, but with so much scrutiny on this series, this has not been possible.\\" PTV cancelled his contract stating that \\"We are a national network and we have certain codes of conduct on what can and cannot be said on air. By talking about ball-tampering and claiming that every successful Pakistani bowler had 'made' the ball, he was damaging national pride, and that is against our policy. So we dropped him.\\" Personal life Qadir was born on 15 September 1955 in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. His brother, Ali Bahadur, was also a leg-spinner who appeared in 10 first-class matches during 1986‚Äì87. Qadir's three sons‚ÄîRehman Qadir, Imran Qadir and Sulaman Qadir‚Äîalso represented different Pakistani teams in the first-class competition, while his younger son, Usman Qadir, has played in 12 List A matches.  Death  On 7 September 2019, Qadir died of cardiac arrest in Lahore.https://www.dawn.com/news/1503898 Qadir died nine days before his 64th birthday. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) paid tributes to Qadir with their Chairman, Ehsan Mani, calling him a \\"maestro with the ball\\". Wasim Khan, the PCB's Chief Executive added: \\"Abdul Qadir was one of the all-time greatest. His friendly and warm presence will forever be missed\\". Shane Warne said: \\"It's very sad news, so condolences to Abdul Qadir's family. I had the opportunity to meet him in 1994 on my first tour to Pakistan. I think a lot of people who bowled leg-spin, like I did, he was the guy who we looked up to in the eighties. He was the main leg-spinner in that era. He was a terrific bowler who bamboozled a lot of batsmen. His record is a terrific one.\\" Prime Minister Imran Khan called him \\"a genius, one of the greatest leg spinners of all time\\", adding that \\"Qadir's bowling statistics do not do justice to his genius\\".

O'Brien served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1987 through 1993, in the Massachusetts Senate from 1993 through 1995, and was the Massachusetts State Treasurer from 1999 through 2003. In that last position she became the first woman to be elected in Massachusetts to statewide office by her own accord. She was the Democratic Party nominee in the Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2002, but lost in the general election to Mitt Romney. Early life and education Four generations of O'Brien's family has served in elected office in Massachusetts government. Her great-grandfather, Michael T. O'Brien, was the proprietor of the family funeral home in Easthampton, Massachusetts, and first elected to the state legislature in 1930. Her father Edward O'Brien (1933-2004) was a lawyer who served on the Massachusetts Governor's Council from 1970 to 1975, left the post to run for Massachusetts Attorney General, losing the 1974 Democratic primary to Francis X. Belotti; Edward ran for Congress in 1976, losing to the incumbent Silvio Conte; he returned to the Governor's Council after the 1978 election and remained in office until his death in 2004. Shannon's mother is named Ann. Shannon has four siblings: Erin, a clerk at the West Roxbury District Court; Gaelan, a court officer in the Northampton District Court; Tara, a former employee at Boston City Hall; and Michael, who runs the family funeral home in Easthampton (job descriptions as of 2002).\\"O'Briens take over title of First Family in state hackarama\\", Boston Herald, August 23, 2002. Shannon O'Brien was born in Boston, Massachusetts. She graduated from Yale University in 1981, where she was captain of the Yale Bulldogs varsity women's soccer team. She graduated from the Boston University School of Law in 1985. Political career O'Brien worked for a large Boston law firm before her father alerted her to an open seat in the state legislature, which she won. O'Brien served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1987 through 1993, and in the Massachusetts Senate from 1993 through 1995. While a state legislator she authored a law that increased penalties for crimes against children such as abuse and neglect. She was the Massachusetts State Treasurer from 1999 through 2003, winning the office in the Massachusetts general election, 1998, after losing in her first attempt for that office in Massachusetts general election, 1994 and subsequently working as a vice president for external affairs at a health-care company. She was the first woman to be elected in Massachusetts to statewide office by her own accord. She came into the office after it had suffered a major embezzlement scandal, and she tightened controls over the funds involved. While serving as State Treasurer, she restructured the lottery commission and the Abandoned Properties Division in Massachusetts, gaining acclaim for returning dormant funds to the residents of the state. She also refinanced state debt and in doing so saved about $500 million. In dealing with the near- infamous Big Dig project in Boston, which became the most expensive highway project in U.S. history, she forced public disclosure of a $2 billion cost overrun. She won the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2002, defeating State Senate President Thomas Birmingham, former Democratic National Committee and American Israel Public Affairs Committee chair Steven Grossman, former United States Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, and former nominee for lieutenant governor Warren Tolman. In this action she became the first woman to win a major party nomination for governor in the Commonwealth. In the general election she garnered 45 percent of the vote to Mitt Romney's 50 percent. Subsequent career Following her defeat in 2002, O'Brien joined Boston-area local television station WLVI as a consumer advocate. She left there in 2005 to head the Boston Area Girl Scouts, and as such is the CEO of the Patriot's Trail Girl Scout Council covering Greater Boston. In January 2014 OIKOS Software appointed O'Brien to its board of directors. O'Brien lives in Massachusetts with her husband, former state representative Emmet Hayes, and children.

Within two decades of the failure of Pi≈Çsudski's grand scheme, all the countries that he had viewed as candidates for membership in the Intermarium federation had fallen to the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany, except for Finland (which suffered some territorial losses in the 1939‚Äì40 Winter War with the Soviet Union).  Precedents  Polish-Lithuanian union at its greatest extent 1386-1434 The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth at its greatest extent, 1635 = Commonwealth = A Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union and military alliance had come about as a mutual response to a common threat posed by the Teutonic Order and the Golden Horde and its successor states, including Muscovy. The alliance was first established in 1385 by the Union of Krewa, solemnized by the marriage of Poland's Queen Jadwiga and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, of the Gediminid dynasty, who became King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço of Poland. A longer-lasting federation was subsequently established via the creation of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, an arrangement that lasted until 1795, i.e., until the Third Partition of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The Polish- Lithuanian union lasted for a total of 410 years. Under the Commonwealth, proposals were advanced to establish an expanded, Polish‚ÄìLithuanian-Muscovite or Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìRuthenian, Commonwealth. These proposals were never implemented. = Czartoryski's plan = Between the November and January Uprisings, in 1832‚Äì61, the idea of resurrecting an updated Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth was advocated by Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, residing in exile at the H√¥tel Lambert in Paris.Marian Kamil Dziewanowski, \\"Polski pionier zjednoczonej Europy\\" (\\"A Polish Pioneer of a United Europe\\"), Gwiazda Polarna (Pole Star), Sept. 17, 2005, pp. 10‚Äì11. In his youth Czartoryski had fought against Russia in the Polish-Russian War of 1792 and would have done so again in the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising of 1794, had he not been arrested at Brussels on his way back to Poland. Subsequently, in 1795 he and his younger brother had been commanded to enter the Russian army, and Catherine the Great had been so favorably impressed with them that she had restored to them part of their confiscated estates. Adam Czartoryski had subsequently served Emperors Paul and Alexander I as a diplomat and foreign minister, during the Napoleonic Wars establishing an anti-French coalition. Czartoryski had been one of the leaders of the Polish November 1830 Uprising and, after its suppression by Russia, had been sentenced to death but eventually allowed to go into exile in France.

In his book, Essai sur la diplomatie (Essay on Diplomacy), completed in 1827 but published only in 1830, Czartoryski observed that, \\"Having extended her sway south and west, and being by the nature of things unreachable from the east and north, Russia becomes a source of constant threat to Europe.\\" He argued that she would have done better, cultivating \\"friends rather than slaves.\\" He also identified a future threat from Prussia and urged the incorporation of East Prussia into a resurrected Poland.Dziewanowski, Polski pionier zjednoczonej Europy, p. 10. His diplomatic efforts anticipated Pi≈Çsudski's Prometheist project in linking efforts for Polish independence with similar movements of other subjugated nations in Europe, as far east as the Caucasus Mountains, most notably in Georgia.Dziewanowski, \\"Polski pionier zjednoczonej Europy,\\" pp. 10‚Äì11. Czartoryski aspired above all to reconstitute‚Äîwith French, British and Turkish support‚Äîa Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth federated with the Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, Romanians and all the South Slavs of the future Yugoslavia.

(The latter was his Prometheist project.) Pi≈Çsudski saw an Intermarium federation as a counterweight to Russian and German imperialism. According to Dziewanowski, the plan was never expressed in systematic fashion but instead relied on Pi≈Çsudski's pragmatic instincts.Review of Joseph Pilsudski: A European Federalist, 1918‚Äì1922, by M. K. Dziewanowski. Reviewed by Kenneth F. Lewalski in the Journal of Modern History, March 1972. Accessed September 16, 2007. According to British scholar George Sanford, about the time of the Polish-Soviet War of 1920 Pi≈Çsudski recognized that the plan was not feasible.George Sanford, Democratic Government in Poland: Constitutional Politics since 1989. Palgrave Macmillan 2002. . Google Print, pp. 5‚Äì6 = Opposition = Pi≈Çsudski's plan faced opposition from virtually all quarters. The Soviets, whose sphere of influence was directly threatened, worked to thwart the Intermarium agenda. The Allied Powers assumed that Bolshevism was only a temporary threat and did not want to see their important (from the balance-of-power viewpoint) traditional ally, Russia, weakened. They resented Pi≈Çsudski's refusal to aid their White allies, viewed Pi≈Çsudski with suspicion, saw his plans as unrealistic, and urged Poland to confine itself to areas of clear-cut Polish ethnicity.Adam Bruno Ulam, Stalin: The Man and His Era, Beacon Press, 1989, , Google Print, p.185 Polish-Soviet War: Battle of Warsaw .

Sanford has described Pi≈Çsudski's policies after his resumption of power in 1926 as similarly focusing on the Polonization of the country's Eastern Slavic minorities and on the centralization of power. While some scholars accept at face value the democratic principles claimed by Pi≈Çsudski for his federative plan,Aviel Roshwald, Ethnic Nationalism and the Fall of Empires: Central Europe, the Middle East and Russia, 1914‚Äì1923, 2001, Routledge (UK), , Google Print, p.49 others view such claims with skepticism, pointing out a coup d'√©tat in 1926 when Pi≈Çsudski assumed nearly dictatorial powers.Yohanan Cohen, Small Nations in Times of Crisis and Confrontation, SUNY Press, 1989, Google Books, p.65 In particular, his project is viewed unfavorably by most Ukrainian historians, with Oleksandr Derhachov arguing that the federation would have created a greater Poland in which the interests of non-Poles, especially Ukrainians, would have received short shrift.\\"The essence of [J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's \\"federalist\\" program] was that after the overthrow of tsardom and the disintegration of the Russian empire, a large, strong and mighty Poland was to be created in Eastern Europe.

Speaking of Poland's future frontiers, Pi≈Çsudski said: \\"All that we can gain in the west depends on the Entente‚Äîon the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany,\\" while in the east \\"there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far.\\"MacMillan, Margaret, Paris 1919 : Six Months That Changed the World, Random House Trade Paperbacks, 2003, , p.212\\" In the eastern chaos, the Polish forces set out to expand as far as feasible. On the other hand, Poland had no interest in joining the western intervention in the Russian Civil War or in conquering Russia itself.JOSEPH PILSUDSKI. Interview by Dymitr Merejkowsky, 1921. Translated from the Russian by Harriet E Kennedy B.A. London & Edinburgh, Sampson Low, Marston & Co Ltd 1921. Pi≈Çsudski said: ‚ÄúPoland can have nothing to do with the restoration of old Russia. Anything rather than that‚Äìeven Bolshevism‚Äù. Quoted from this site . = Failure = Pi≈Çsudski's revised Intermarium plan J√≥zef Beck's plan for \\"Third Europe\\" alliance of Poland, Romania, Hungary In the aftermath of the Polish-Soviet War (1919‚Äì21), Pi≈Çsudski's concept of a federation of Central and Eastern European countries, based on a Polish-Ukrainian axis, lost any chance of realization.Tadeusz Marczak, \\"Miƒôdzymorze wczoraj i dzi≈õ \\" (\\"Miƒôdzymorze Yesterday and Today\\"), a Polish-language version of the paper, \\"Myezhdumorye vchera i syevodnia\\" (\\"Miƒôdzymorze Yesterday and Today\\"), published in Belarus ‚Äì Polsha: Put k sotrudnichestvu. Materialy Miezhdunarodnoy Nauchnoy Konfierientsii (Belarus and Poland: the Path toward Cooperation. Materials of an International Scholarly Conference), Minsk, Belarus, 2005. Pi≈Çsudski next contemplated a federation or alliance with the Baltic and Balkan states. This plan envisioned a Central European union including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Scandinavia, the Baltic states, Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Greece‚Äîthus stretching not only west-east from the Baltic to the Black Sea, but north-south from the Arctic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. This project also failed: Poland was distrusted by Czechoslovakia and Lithuania; and while it had relatively good relations with the other countries, they had tensions with their neighbors, making it virtually impossible to create in Central Europe a large block of countries that all had good relations with each other. In the end, in place of a large federation, only a Polish-Romanian alliance was established, beginning in 1921.Hugh Ragsdale, The Soviets, the Munich Crisis, and the Coming of World War II, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge In comparison, Czechoslovakia had more success with its Little Entente (1920‚Äì38) with Romania and Yugoslavia, supported by France. Pi≈Çsudski died in 1935. A later, much reduced version of his concept was attempted by interwar Polish Foreign Minister J√≥zef Beck, a Pi≈Çsudski prot√©g√©. His proposal, during the late 1930s, of a \\"Third Europe\\"‚Äîan alliance of Poland, Romania and Hungary‚Äîgained little ground before World War II supervened. Disregarding the 1932 Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, the Soviet Union allied itself with Nazi Germany to divide Central and Eastern Europe between them.Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, Intermarium: The Land between the Black and Baltic Seas. Transaction Publishers: New Brunswick, NJ., 2012. According to some historians, it was the failure to create a strong counterweight to Germany and the Soviet Union, as proposed by Pi≈Çsudski, that doomed Intermarium's prospective member countries to their fates in World War II.  World War II and since  Polish World War II Premier Gen. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski The concept of a \\"Central [and Eastern] European Union\\"‚Äî a triangular geopolitical entity anchored in the Baltic, Black, and Adriatic or Aegean Seas‚Äîwas revived during World War II in W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski's Polish Government in Exile. A first step toward its implementation‚Äî1942 discussions between the Greek, Yugoslav, Polish and Czechoslovak governments in exile regarding prospective Greek-Yugoslav and Polish-Czechoslovak federations‚Äîultimately foundered on Soviet opposition, which led to Czech hesitation and Allied indifference or hostility. A declaration by the Polish Underground State in that period called for the creation of a Central and Eastern European federal union undominated by any one state. P. 246 On 12 May 2011, the Visegr√°d Group countries (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary) announced the formation of a Visegr√°d Battlegroup under Poland's command. The battlegroup was in place by 2016 as an independent force, not part of the NATO command. In addition, starting in 2013, the four countries were to begin joint military exercises under the auspices of the NATO Response Force. Some scholars saw this as a first step toward close Central European regional cooperation.Visegrad: New European Military Force ., May 16, 2011. On 6 August 2015, Polish President Andrzej Duda, in his inaugural address, announced plans to build a regional alliance of Central European states, modeled on the Intermarium concept. In 2016 the Three Seas Initiative held an initial summit meeting in Dubrovnik, Croatia. The Three Seas Initiative has 12 member states along a north‚Äìsouth axis from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is the second-longest operating hotel in Denver. It is one of the first atrium-style hotels ever built. It is now operated by HEI Hotels and Resorts, and joined Marriott's Autograph Collection Hotels in 2012. The hotel is located at 321 17th Street between 17th Street, Broadway and Tremont Place in downtown Denver behind the Republic Plaza. The main entrance door is on Tremont Place. History The hotel was built in 1892 of sandstone and red granite, one year later than the Oxford Hotel. It was named for its original owner, Henry C. Brown, who had homesteaded the Capitol Hill area,Noel, ThomasJ., Buildings of Colorado, Oxford University Press, New York 1997 p.53 and was designed with its distinctive triangular shape by architect Frank Edbrooke, who also designed the Oxford Hotel. The interior and the exterior of the building are considered to be the \\"finest extant example\\" of Edbrooke's work.Morris, Langdon, Denver Landmarks, photos by Melvyn E. Schieltz, Charles W. Cleworth Publisher, Denver, Colorado 1979 pp. 310-311 Built with an iron and steel frame covered with cement and sandstone by the Whitehouse & Wirgler Stone Company, the building was \\"one of America's first fireproof structures, according to a May 21, 1892 cover story in Scientific American.\\" Upon its completion it was Denver's tallest building.Noel, ThomasJ., Buildings of Colorado, Oxford University Press, New York 1997 p. 53 In the early 1930s Colorado muralist Allen Tupper True began discussing the possibility of creating two murals for the hotel with then owner Denver financier Charles Boettcherhttp://jeffco.us/boettcher-mansion/history/charles-boettcher/ and after some delay the two works, Stage Coach and Airplane Travel were unveiled in the hotel's lobby in 1937.True, Jere and Victoria Tupper Kirby, Allen Tupper True: An American Artist, Canyon Leap, San Francisco in association with the Museum of the Rockies, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana pp.374-380 In 1935, as a celebration of the Repeal of Prohibition in the United States, Denver architect Alan Fisher designed \\"Ship Tavern\\"; one of four restaurants inside The Brown Palace.Noel, ThomasJ., Buildings of Colorado, Oxford University Press, New York 1997 p. 54 On April 7, 2020, the Brown Palace Hotel closed indefinitely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the first time in the hotel's 128-year history that it has closed its doors to guests. Annex The 22-story, 231-room tower directly across Tremont Place was built as a new wing of the hotel in 1959, known as the Brown Palace West.http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/07/prweb12850182.htm For many years it operated as a budget wing of the hotel, until the Brown Palace's owners branded the guest rooms in the annex as a Comfort Inn in 1988, and then as a Holiday Inn Express in December 2014.http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2014/12/18/brown-palace-annex- becomes-a-holiday-inn-express.html The lower levels of the tower are shared with the Brown Palace, including the Grand Ballroom and executive offices. The tower is connected to the main building by a skybridge over Tremont Place and a service tunnel running under the street. Past guests Past guests include the \\"Unsinkable\\" Molly Brown (she stayed at the hotel only a week after the Titanic disaster), infamous Denver crime boss Jefferson \\"Soapy\\" Smith, Dr. Sun Yat Sen (just before becoming the president of the new Republic of China), Queen Marie of Romania, and The Beatles. Presidential guests include William Taft, Warren Harding, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Murders of 1911 The hotel was the site of the high-profile 1911 murders in which Frank Henwood shot and killed Sylvester Louis \\"Tony\\" von Phul, and accidentally killed an innocent bystander, George Copeland, in the hotel's \\"Marble Bar.\\" Henwood and von Phul were rivals for (or shared) the affections of Denver socialite Isabel Springer, the wife of wealthy Denver businessman and political candidate John W. Springer. The murders culminated in a series of very public trials. Popular culture The hotel features in the 2017 Jane Fonda and Robert Redford film Our Souls at Night.

They speak Xitsonga, a Southern Bantu language. A very small number of Tsonga people are also found in Zimbabwe and Northern Swaziland. The Tsonga people of South Africa share some history with the Tsonga people of Southern Mozambique; however they differ culturally and linguistically from the Tonga people of Zambia and Zimbabwe. History Tsonga wooden headrest Tsonga globular pot, collected c. 1900 The Tsonga people originated from Central and East Africa somewhere between AD 200 and 500, and have been migrating in-and-out of South Africa for over a thousand (1,000) years. Initially, the Tsonga people settled on the coastal plains of Northern Mozambique but finally settled in the Transvaal Province and around parts of St Lucia Bay in South Africa from as early as the 1300s.Junod, H.A (1912), The Life of a South African Tribe: The Social Life, Imprimerie Attinger Freres, Neuchatel. One of the earliest reputable written accounts of the Tsonga people is by Henri Philipe (HP) Junod titled \\"Matimu ya Vatsonga 1498-1650\\" which was formally published in 1977, and it speaks of the earliest Tsonga kingdoms. Before this, the older Henri Alexandri (HA) Junod released his work titled \\"The life of a South African Tribe\\" which was first published under two volumes in 1912-1913 and re-published in 1927. The historical movements of the Tsonga people is dominated by separate migrations, with the Tembe people settling at the Southern parts of Swaziland around the 1350s and the Van'wanati and Vanyayi settling in the eastern Limpopo region between the late 1400s and 1650s. Separate migrations from parts of Mozambique occurred shortly thereafter and particularly during the 1800s. According to historical records acquired from the Portuguese (who are perhaps the first Europeans to ship to African soil in the 1400s) and Swiss Missionaries who arrived to Mozambique and South Africa in the 1800s, Portuguese sailors encountered Tsonga tribes near the coast of Mozambique.Junod, Henri (1977), Matimu Ya Vatsonga: 1498-1650, Braamfontein: Sasavona Publishers. Early tribes identified are names such as the Mpfumo who belong to the Rhonga clan within the wider Tsonga (Thonga) ethnicity, and further identified during the 1500-1650 are the Valenga, Vacopi, Vatonga (Nyembana), Vatshwa, and Vandzawu. The Vatsonga people from very early on were much like a confederacy where different groups settled and assimilated within a particular area and adopted a similar language that differed on the basis of geographic location (dialect). Various dialects of the Thonga/Tsonga language emerged from around the 1200s or earlier, such as Xirhonga, Xin'walungu, Xihlanganu, Xibila, Xihlengwe, and Xidjonga. They held large territorial areas in southern Mozambique and parts of South Africa and extracted tribute for those who passed through (paying tribute was to secure passage or to be spared from attack). The Tsonga tribes also operated like a confederacy in supplying regiments to different groups in the northern Transvaal region during times of Great Zimbabwe establishment and engaged in trade. The Nkuna and Valoyi tribes which supplied soldiers to help the Modjadji kingdom; and the Nkomati and Mabunda tribes for supplying regiments to the army of Joao Albasini (Xipolongo empire). The Tsonga people have an age-old custom of leading their own tribes, with a senior traditional leader at the forefront of their own tribal establishment and is seen with a status equal to that of a king. The Tsonga people have lived according to these customs for ages and they hold the belief that \\"vukosi a byi peli nambu\\" which is a metaphor meaning \\"kingship does not cross territorial or family borders\\". Within apartheid South Africa, a Tsonga \\"homeland\\", Gazankulu Bantustan, was created out of part of northern Transvaal Province (Now Limpopo Province and Mpumalanga) during the 1960s and was granted self-governing status in 1973. This bantustan's economy depended largely on gold and on a small manufacturing sector. However, only an estimated 500,000 people‚Äîless than half the Tsonga population of South Africa‚Äîever lived there. Many others joined township residents from other parts of South Africa around urban centres, especially Johannesburg and Pretoria. Many Tsonga people settled down and became bakers.(No heat was used obviously) No, the cakes weren't traditional. But they tried their best. They used bugs and dried worms as decorations. Many believe thats were the concept of caked came from. Name The Constitution of South Africa stipulates that all South Africans have a right to identify with their own language, and points out that tribal affiliations or \\"ethnicity\\" is identifiable mostly through a common language; hence the recognition of groups such as, for example the Xhosas who are united by isiXhosa; Zulus who are united by isiZulu; Vendas who are united by Tshivenda; and the Sothos who are united by Sesotho. The various groups who speak the Xitsonga language or one of its dialects are therefore also united by the language and take its name from it, hence Constitutionally they are the Tsonga people (Vatsonga). There are also other Tsonga groups in parts of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Swaziland. Other related groups outside of South Africa who are ancestral or related to the South African Tsonga people go by various tribal names (e.g., Tonga, Rhonga, Chopi, Tswa) but they are sometimes classified within the heritage and history of the Tsonga people of South Africa. Language The Tsonga people speak the Xitsonga language, which is one of the official languages of the Republic of South Africa. According to historians, the Xitsonga language had already developed during the 1500s with its predecessor the \\"Thonga language\\" identified as the main origin. It was mostly through the missionary work of the late 1800s to mid-1900s that led to a cohesive study of the Tsonga people's dialects and language features. The work carried out by Henri Junod and his father left a lasting legacy for the Tsonga people to rediscover their past history. It was however Paul Berthoud and his companion Ernest Creux who actively engaged with the Tsonga people of the Spelonken region to eventually produce the first hymn books written in the Xitsonga language at around 1878.Harries, P 1987, The Roots of Ethnicity: Discourse and the Politics of Language Construction in South-East Africa, University of the Witwatersrand. These Swiss Missionaries, however, did not understand the Xitsonga language at all and had to depend on the guidance of native speakers for the translations. The first book written in the Xitsonga language was published in 1883 by Paul Berthoud after dedicating enough time to learning the language. The Tsonga people themselves had then begun to learn to read and write in Xitsonga, however that the Tsonga people had already been well affluent in the Xitsonga language or one of its dialects long before the arrival of the Swiss Missionaries. There is evidence to indicate that the \\"language was already- spoken by the primitive occupants of the country more than 500 years\\" before the arrival of Swiss Missionaries.(Junod 1912, p. 32) Conflicts and naming conventions The name \\"Tsonga\\" or \\"Vatsonga\\" itself is properly related to the older \\"Thonga\\" (also spelled as Tonga in some instances). The Thonga people are one of the original African tribes who left Central Africa between 200AD and 500AD and gave birth to many cultural identities in Southern Africa. The name \\"Thonga\\" has various meanings in different languages. In the Shona language it means \\"people of the river\\", or \\"kingless\\"; in isiZulu it means \\"ancestral spirits\\", \\"stick\\", \\"hunter\\", or \\"the prestigious ones\\". The Thonga people settled at various parts of southern Africa and thus different cultural identities were born who still identify with a common heritage. The Tembe people of KwaZulu-Natal, for example, still praise themselves as \\"amaThonga\\" but are now a part of the Zulu language and culture after being integrated in northern KwaZulu Natal.Sowetan Live (2008), ‚ÄúTembes on a Mission to Unify Tongas‚Äù, Retrieved on 11 October 2018 The Rhonga people were identified according to the eastern direction from which they lived (Rhonga means East in the Rhonga dialect) and they included the tribes of Mpfumo of Nhlaruti, Nondwane, Vankomati, and Mabota. Another example is the Valenge and Chopi people (vaCopi) of Gunyule and Dzavana who are also related to the Tsonga people of South Africa such as the Maluleke, Shivambu, Mhinga, and Mulamula, and still regard themselves as part of the larger Thonga/Tonga group.Maluleke, V.M. (2013), \\"My Roots\\", Retrieved on September 29, 2018 The tribes often identified as the Gwamba (properly the descendants of Gwambe) such as the tribes of Baloyi, Mathebula, and Nyai, also formed the Kalanga and Rozwi tribes. Other tribes include the Hlengwe people who are descended from those who called themselves Vatswa (sometimes spelled Tshwa) and also the Khosa who identified with the Djonga and Mbai sub-group. Indeed most of the Tsonga people of South Africa are descended from breakaway groups of the Thonga which must have happened around the 1600s with the dawn of the arrival of the Portuguese in Mozambique.Mathebula, M, Nkuna, R, Mabasa, H, & Maluleke, M (2006), 'Tsonga History Perspective'. In South Africa the name \\"Shangaan\\" or \\"Machangane\\" is regularly applied to the entire Tsonga population; however, this is a common misconception and others even take offense to it with regards to tribal affiliation.Mathebula, Mandla (2002), 800 Years of Tsonga History: 1200-2000, Burgersfort: Sasavona Publishers and Booksellers Pty Ltd. What can be identified as the Shangaan tribe only forms a small fraction of the entire Tsonga ethnic group, meaning that the term \\"Shangaan\\" should only be applied to that tribe which is directly related to Soshangane ka Zikode (a Nguni general from the Ndwandwe tribe) who came to power during the 1800s, as well as those tribes which were founded or assimilated directly by him. In contrast, the Tsonga ethnic group comprises various tribal identities, some of which have been recognised and well established in Mozambique and South Africa even back around 1350 all the way through the 1600s to 1900s, namely the Varhonga, Vaxika, Vahlengwe, Van'wanati, Vacopi, Valoyi, and others. On the other hand, the double barrel term \\"Tsonga-Shangaan\\" is often applied in a way similar to Sotho and Tswana; Pedi and Lobedu; or Xhosa and Mpondo. Historical research shows that a substantial number of Tsonga tribes have been living together in South Africa during the 1400s to 1700s at a time where the name \\"Shangaan\\" had not yet existed. Back during the 1640s-1700s the Tsonga people of South Africa were already integrated and living together established under their own traditional leaderships (such as the kingdoms led by Gulukhulu, Xihlomulo of the Valozyi, Maxakadzi of the Van'wanati, and Ngomani of the Vaxika).Theal, GM (1902), The Beginning of South African History, London: T.Fisher unwin. When Soshangane (whom the name \\"Shangaan\\" is taken from) and other Nguni invaders raided Mozambique later during the 1820s, the Tsonga people who were already living prior under Dutch colonialism in South Africa did not form a part of the Nguni Shangaan empire (and were often hostile to it) and they had already been speaking the Xitsonga language through dialects such as Xin'walungu, Xihlanganu, Xidzonga, etc. within the Transvaal.Junod, HA 1913, The Life of a South African Tribe: The Psychic Life, Imprimerie Attinger Freres, Neuchatel. Such Tsonga tribes have never been subjects of the Gaza Shangaan empire and have always retained their senior traditional leadership even during the governance of the Apartheid homeland system. The misconception that they were all united by a single leader appears to be false as most of the people who organised the early Tsonga/Tonga groupings would still be integrated within South Africa even if the Mfecane Nguni wars did not happen. In addition to this, many of the Tsonga tribes who were still in Mozambique and later attacked by Soshangane and other Ndwandwes in the 1820s distanced themselves and fled to the Transvaal to re-establish themselves outside of the influence of the Gaza empire (they refused to be led by the Ngunis), while some remained and were either subjugated or enslaved. Having said that, it is well known that the Gaza Empire was vast and included areas occupied by the Tsonga. Many Tsonga identified themselves as Shangani and there is a wealth of Nguni names and words in their language which testifies of the Gaza Nguni rulership of these groups. The Copi people (Chopi) however, claim that they remained rebellious and independent throughout the lifetime of the Gaza kingdom and were never properly defeated,Henri Philippe Junod (1927) Some Notes on T‚à´opi Origins, Bantu Studies, 3:1, 57-71, DOI: 10.1080/02561751.1927.9676196, viewed 4 December 2018 and when the ruler of Gaza (Nghunghunyana) invaded their territory near the Limpopo River and attempted to subjugate them in 1888, a war ensued between the Chopi people and the Gaza forces that effectively lasted from 1889 and ended in 1895 when Nghunghunyana was defeated by the Portuguese (led by their general Mouzinho de Albuquerque) in alliance with Chopi soldiers (led by their king Xipenenyana).Afrolegends (2013), ‚ÄòGungunyane: The Lion of Gaza or the Last African King of Mozambique‚Äô, Retrieved 23 August 2018 Many of the Gaza people fled from the disintegrated Empire and its remaining leadership took asylum in South Africa where most of the Tsonga people had been living before the Mfecane wars started. In South Africa, the Gaza-Shangaan people lost their Nguni language which was prevalent within the Empire due largely to the new reality and they adopted the Xitsonga language in the Transvaal but still largely identify with Nguni customs. In modern South Africa, the integration of such tribes has led to a social cohesion drive where some of the Tsonga people believe they face an identity crisis as a result of perceived tribalism of the Ndwandwe Shangaan tribe against the original Tsonga tribes.VivLifestyle (2017), 'Why does Munghana Lonene FM insist on labeling us as ‚ÄúVatsonga- Machangani‚Äù?', accessed 11 October 2017 Another factor is the Gaza-Shangaan people's association with a history of oppression and exploitation that the inhabitants of Mozambique suffered under the rule of the Gaza Empire during the 1800s, which has been well-documented by reliable sources and is a subject of much controversy and debate.Harries, P 1981, Slavery Amongst the Gaza Nguni: Its Changing Shape and Function and its Relationship to Other Forms of Exploitation, in JB Peires (ed.), pp. 210-229.Liesegang, G. (1986). Nghunghunyani Nqumayo: Rei de Gaza 1884-1895 e o desaparecimento do seu estado. Arquivo de Patrim√≥nio Cultural. Clan structures The Tsonga ethnic group has been united by the gradual assimilation of various nearing tribes found in abundance within Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and South Africa respectively. Historical research indicates that the development of a common language (Xitsonga) as well as cultural integration within the Tsonga ethnic group has been occurring ever since the 1200s (over 800 years ago). It is possible that different conflicting groups sought to establish protection alliances and thus integrated their tribes into a common establishment or to secure trade. Language appears to be the dominant factor in uniting the Tsonga tribes, similarly to the Venda people who are also of various tribes united by the Venda language. It is distortion of Tsonga history to say that the Tsonga people have never been united by a single royal family (Hlengwe) but by various tribal kingdoms that fought for dominance over time, who were eventually overcame by internal conflicts as well as the impact of colonial rule. However there is evidence to suggest that the earliest most dominant Tsonga kingdom within South African territory from the 1600s to the late 1800s was the Hlengwe Dynasty of Mahimi Mkhumuli Mabasa/Chauke and in the late 1900s was the Mhinga Dynasty, who founded Malamulele (the Rescuer) and further formed the leadership of the Gazankulu territorial authority around the 1960s in what is today the eastern parts of the Limpopo province.Witter, R. (2010), Taking their territory with them when they go: Mobility and access in Mozambique‚Äôs Limpopo National Park, Unpublished Ph.D. thesis, University of Georgia.Bandama, F. (2013), The Archaeology and Technology of Metal Production in the Late Iron Age of the Southern Waterberg, Limpopo Province, South Africa, Doctors thesis, University of Cape Town. The Van'wanati clan according to Henry A. Junod (1912) are also the ones who re-assimilated the Baloyi and Vanyayi clans who left the Kalanga country and became Tsonga-speaking. However the Baloyi were part of the original Thonga cluster of clans (through their ancestor Gwambe) before they went to conquer parts of Zimbabwe and were nicknamed as Barozwi (\\"the destroyers\\"). The Tsonga people themselves still recognize their respective tribal origins and have also embraced the Tsonga national identity, which unites them linguistically and culturally within South Africa. The biggest factor in uniting the various Xitsonga-speaking tribes in South African territory is the role played by Sunduza II of the Mhinga Dynasty in 1961 where he mobilized all the Tsonga chiefs to form a territorial authority that enabled the Tsonga people to retain their own recognition equal to the Venda and Pedi territorial authorities (Mathebula 2002, p. 37). Sunduza II Mhinga, a descendant of Dzavana and the king of the Chopi people Gunyule, began his pursuits to unite the Tsonga clans in the 1950s when the apartheid government attempted to assimilate the Tsonga and Shangaan people into the Venda and Pedi Bantustans. Sunduza II then called a meeting for all the leading Tsonga chiefs in 1957 and made a resolution to unite and resist the impending assimilation. The leadership by Sunduza II resulted in the apartheid government engaging in diplomatic talks which unilaterally granted the Tsonga people recognition to form their own territorial authority. This greatly cemented the unity between the Tsonga and Shangaan people from the formation of the Gazankulu Homeland where Hudson Ntsanwisi (a member of the Vanwanati clan) became the first Chief Minister of the Tsonga and Shangaan people. Xitsonga-speaking communities of South Africa after 1890 (through a Xitsonga-related dialect or sub dialect): * Vatsonga (Thonga, Tsonga,Xitanga) * Amashangana (Ngoni, Ndwandwe) Population In total, there were 7, 3 million Tsonga speakers in 2011, divided mainly between South Africa and Mozambique. South Africa was home to 3,3 million Tsonga speakers in the 2011 population census, while Mozambique accounted for 4 million speakers of the language. A small insignificant number of speakers included 15 000 Tsonga speakers in Swaziland and roughly 18 000 speakers in Zimbabwe. In South Africa, Tsonga people were concentrated in the following municipal areas during the 2011 population census: Greater Giyani Local Municipality (248,000 people), Bushbuckridge Local Municipality (320,000 people), Greater Tzaneen Local Municipality (195,000 people), Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality (80,000 people), Makhado Local Municipality (170,000 people), Thulamela Local Municipality (220,000 people), City of Tshwane (280,000 people), City of Johannesburg (290,000 people), and Ekurhuleni (260,000 people). In the following municipalities, Tsonga people are present but they are not large enough or are not significant enough to form a dominant community in their shere of influence, in most cases, they are less than 50,000 people in each municipality. At the same time, they are not small enough to be ignored as they constitute the largest minority language group. They are as follows: Greater Letaba Local Municipality (28,00 people), Mbombela Local Municipality (26,000) people, Nkomazi Local Municipality (28,500) people, Mogalakwena Local Municipality (31,400 people), Madibeng Local Municipality (51,000), Moretele Local Municipality (34,000), and Rustenburg Local Municipality (30,000). The provincial breakdown of Tsonga speakers, according to the 2011 census, are as follows: Limpopo Province (1,006,000 people, Mpumalanga Province (415,000 people, Gauteng Province (800,000 people and North West Province (110,000 people. Overall, Tsonga speakers constitutes 4.4% of South Africa's total population. Economy The Tsonga traditional economy is based on mixed agriculture and pastoralism. Cassava is the staple; corn (maize), millet, sorghum, and other crops are also grown. Women do much of the agricultural work,while men and teenage boys take care of domestic animals (a herd of cows, sheep, and goats) although some men grow cash crops. Most Tsongas now have jobs in South Africa and Mozambique. Culture Tsonga women perform the xibelani dance. Tsonga men traditionally attend the initiation school for circumcision called Matlala (KaMatlala) or Ngoma (e Ngomeni) after which they are regarded as men. Young teenage girls attend an initiation school that old Vatsonga women lead called Khomba, and initiates are therefore called tikhomba (khomba- singular, tikhomba- plural). Only virgins are allowed to attend this initiation school where they will be taught more about womanhood, how to carry themselves as tikhomba in the community, and they are also readied for marriage. The Vatsonga people living along the Limpopo River in South Africa have recently gained a significant amount of attention for their high-tech, lo-fi electronic dance music Xitsonga Traditional and otherwise promoted as Tsonga Disco, electro, and Tsonga ndzhumbha. The more traditional dance music of the Tsonga people was pioneered by the likes of General MD Shirinda, Fanny Mpfumo, Matshwa Bemuda, and Thomas Chauke, while the experimental genres of Tsonga disco and Tsonga ndzhumbha have been popularized by artists such as Joe Shirimani, Penny Penny, Peta Teanet, and Benny Mayengani. The more westernized type of sound which includes a lot of English words, sampled vocals and heavy synthesizers is promoted as Shangaan electro in Europe and has been pioneered by the likes of Nozinja, the Tshetsha Boys, and DJ Khwaya. The Tsonga people are also known for a number of traditional dances such as the Makhwaya, Xighubu, Mchongolo and Xibelani dances. Traditional beliefs and healers n'angas relax and celebrate after an initiation dedicated to the Ndau spirit. Senior N'angas help a new n'agna out of the water during an initiation Like most Bantu cultures, the Tsonga people have a strong acknowledgement of their ancestors, who are believed to have a considerable effect on the lives of their descendants. The traditional healers are called n'anga. Legend has it that the first Tsonga diviners of the South African lowveld were a woman called Nkomo We Lwandle (Cow of the Ocean) and a man called Dunga Manzi (Stirring Waters). A powerful water serpent, Nzunzu (Ndhzhundzhu), allegedly captured them and submerged them in deep waters. They did not drown, but lived underwater breathing like fish. Once their kin had slaughtered a cow for Nzunzu, they were released and emerged from the water on their knees as powerful diviners with an assortment of potent herbs for healing. Nkomo We Lwandle and Dunga Manzi became famous healers and trained hundred of women and men as diviners. Among the Tsongas, symptoms such as persistent pains, infertility and bouts of aggression can be interpreted as signs that an alien spirit has entered a person's body. When this occurs, the individual will consult a n'anga to diagnose the cause of illness. If it has been ascertained that the person has been called by the ancestors to become a n'anga, they will become a client of a senior diviner who will not only heal the sickness, but also invoke the spirits and train them to become diviners themselves. The legend of the water serpent is re- enacted during the diviner's initiation, by ceremoniously submerging the initiates in water from which they emerge as diviners. The kind of spirits that inhabit a person are identified by the language they speak. There are generally the Ngoni (derived from the word Nguni), the Ndau and the Malopo. The Ndau spirit possesses the descendants of the Gaza soldiers who had slain the Ndau and taken their wives. Once the spirit has been converted from hostile to benevolent forces, the spirits bestow the powers of divination and healing on the nganga.

Origin of the concept in Karl Marx's Capital  The term superprofit (extra surplus-value) was first used by Marx in Das Kapital. It refers to above-average enterprise profits, arising in three main situations: * Technologically advanced firms operating at above average productivity in a competitive growing market. * Under conditions of declining demand, only firms with above-average productivity would obtain the previous socially average profit rate as the rest would book lower profits. * Monopolies of resources or technologies, yielding what are effectively land rents, mining rents, or technological rents. Although Marx does not discuss this in detail (beyond referring to international productivity differentials in the world economy), there could be included a fourth case, namely superprofits arising from structural unequal exchange in the world economy. In this case, superprofit arises simply through buying products cheaply in one place and selling them at a much higher price elsewhere, yielding an above- average profit margin. This type of superprofit may not be attributable to extra productivity or monopoly conditions and represent only a transfer of value from one place to another.  Leninist interpretation  According to Leninism, superprofits are extracted from the workers in colonial (or Third World) countries by the imperialist powers (in the First World). Part of these superprofits are then distributed (in the form of increased living standards) to the workers in the imperialists' home countries in order to buy their loyalty, achieve political stability and avoid a workers' revolution, usually by means of reformist labor parties. The workers who receive a large enough share of the superprofits have an interest to defend the capitalist system, so they become a labor aristocracy. Superprofit in Marxist‚ÄìLeninist theory is the result of unusually severe exploitation or superexploitation. All capitalist profit in Marxist‚ÄìLeninist theory is based on exploitation (the business owners extract surplus value from the workers), but superprofit is achieved by taking exploitation above and beyond its normal level. In Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, there are no profits that could result from an activity or transaction that did not involve exploitation, except socialist profits in a Soviet-type economy.  Criticism of Leninist interpretation  Critics of Lenin's theory (including many Marxists) hold a different view. Their argument can be summarised in the following points: * The average rate of surplus value is typically higher in rich countries because of higher labor-productivity. * High-paid skilled workers can be very militant and display class consciousness. * The existence of reformist labor parties in the Third World. * The differences in wages between rich and poor countries are far greater than the differences in wages within rich countries‚Äîso if anything, the whole working class in rich countries is a labor aristocracy from a global point of view. * It is not clear that workers in the imperialist country directly share in repatriated profits from overseas dominions. * The actual amount of repatriated profit from overseas investments that could trickle down to the working class as salary income is not large enough to sustain a labor aristocracy, if there is one. * Probably the main economic benefit that workers in rich countries obtain directly from poor countries is cheap consumer goods, but in fact the monetary value of these goods is statistically only a small part of their total budget. The big ticket foreign-made items in working class budgets are foreign computer hardware, foreign-made appliances and foreign cars (i.e. durable consumer goods), but out of that total expenditure only a small fraction represents goods from poor countries. Leninists reply that cheap consumer goods are precisely the method through which global capitalists allow workers in their home countries to share in their superprofits. The capitalists could sell those consumer goods at higher prices and obtain higher profits, but they choose to sell them cheap instead in order to make them widely available to workers in their home countries and thereby spread a consumer culture that erodes class consciousness and removes the threat of revolution. In other words, capitalists sacrifice some of their superprofit‚Äîeither consciously or unconsciously‚Äîfor the sake of increased stability at home. Once a worker owns a foreign-made fridge, car, stereo, DVD- player and vacuumcleaner, he no longer thinks of revolution and thinks capitalism is the best of all possible worlds. However, other Marxists regard this line of thinking as a vulgar economic reductionism and regard it as a fallacy to think that capitalists choose to sell goods cheaply for some political purpose. That would be only an exception to the rule, which is that goods are sold at the highest price that enables those goods to be sold.  Ernest Mandel's theory  Ernest Mandel argues in his book Late Capitalism that the frontline of capitalist development is always ruled by the search for surplus-profits (above-average returns). Mandel argues that the growth pattern of modern capitalism is shaped by the quest for surplus-profits in monopolistic and oligopolistic markets in which a few large corporations dominate supply. Thus, the extra or above-average profits do not arise so much from real productivity gains, but from corporations monopolising access to resources, technologies and markets. It is not so much that enterprises with superior productivity outsell competitors, but that competitors are blocked in various ways from competing, for example through cartelisation, mergers, fusions, take-overs, government-sanctioned licensing, exclusive production and selling rights. In that case, the extra profits have less to do with reward for entrepreneurship than with market position and market power, i.e. the ability to offload business costs onto someone else (the state, consumers and other businesses) and force consumers to pay extra for access to the goods and services they buy, based on supply monopolies. Tibor Pal√°nkai instead argues that while superprofit can be monopolistic profit, abusing monopoly position is regulated by rigorous competition policies in developed democratic countries. Superprofit coming from other sources like comparative advantages or technical innovation contribute to public welfare.

He is regarded as the pioneer to lift Sri Lankan cricket from underdog status to one of great forces in cricketing world. After retirement, he worked in many posts of Sri Lanka Cricket administration. By entering his father's stream of politics, Ranatunga started his political career in 2005, and is now the cabinet Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Full-list-of-Cabinet- ministers-160073.html Upon retirement from playing cricket he entered politics, joining the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and entered parliament, from Colombo District, in the 2001 elections. He served a tenure as deputy minister for tourism, and also served as the president of Sri Lanka Cricket until December 2008. He joined the Democratic National Alliance in 2010 and contested the 2010 elections.  Personal life  Arjuna Ranatunga is the son of Reggie Padmasena Rantunga, the third Governor of Sabaragamuwa, serving between June 2005 and February 2008. He has five siblings; cricketer Sanjeeva Ranatunga, along with Dammika Ranatunga, Nishantha Ranatunga, Prasanna Ranatunga, and Ruwan Ranatunga. He was born on 1 December 1963 in Gampaha near Colombo. He has a son Dhyan Ranatunga who is also a cricketer.http://www.espncricinfo.com/srilanka/content/player/364996.html Cricket career =Captaincy= Ranatunga went on to captain the Sri Lanka national cricket team in 1988, taking control of it for the next 11 years, transforming it from a weak, routinely defeated team into a competitive and successful unit. He led the team to win the 1996 World Cup. His innovative captaincy took a Sri Lanka team, given little chance prior to the competition, for cricket's greatest prize. His strategies were commended by many cricketing greats and followed by their teams. He was the brain behind the strategy of scoring as many runs as possible in the first 15 overs of an ODI match in which there are field restrictions. This strategy was still followed by the batsmen in the Powerplays. He was widely recognised as a belligerent leader and was famous for defending his players at all costs regardless of what they did. =Retirement= Ranatunga lost the national team captaincy in 1999 after Sri Lanka's poor showing at the World Cup in England, although he was chosen as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year for that year. In June 2000, Ranatunga played in Sri Lanka's 100th Test match, becoming the only player to represent his country in their first and hundredth Test.Shenton, p.9. He retired from playing cricket in 2001. Controversies =Fitness= Ranatunga was known for controversially calling a runner during long innings due to his level of fitness. After the second final of the One Day triangular series in Australia in the 1995/6 season, when the incident with Healy occurred, Ranatunga instructed his players not to shake the Australian players' hands. During this match, Sanath Jayasuriya and Australian paceman Glenn McGrath were also involved in physical jostling; Jayasuriya accused McGrath of racially abusing him, a claim that the bowler denied. =Defence of Muralitharan= Ranatunga is also remembered for his stand in a One Day International against England. Australian Umpire Ross Emerson called Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing. (Muralitharan was subsequently cleared by bio- mechanical experts hired by the ICC.) Ranatunga exchanged heated words with umpire Emerson and led his team to a point just inside the boundary line, halting play and giving the impression that he was about to forfeit the match, until the Sri Lankan management conferred with him and play resumed. English captain, Alec Stewart, was openly critical of Ranatunga's behaviour. In a comment caught on the stump microphone he was heard to say to Ranatunga \\"Your conduct today has been appalling for a country's captain\\". The match was bad- tempered, with instances of shoulder-bumping. =Wrangles with Warne= There has always been a grudging mutual admiration between Warne and Ranatunga. When the former visited Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami to aid Muralitharan in his \\"great work\\"Warne 2008. there, he developed an amiable rapport with his long-time foe: \\"We even wagged,\\" he confirmed later. Not long after, however, Ranatunga was lambasting him in a scathing newspaper attack. \\"You can't be mates with everyone,\\" Warne wrote in his 2008 book Shane Warne's Century, serialised by The Times in September, \\"and if there was any way I could knock him down to number 101The book details Warne's selection of the 100 greatest players of his time. Ranatunga found himself at 93. for the purposes of this book, I'd be delighted to do so. But having taken on the task, I want to do it seriously, and the fact is that Ranatunga helped to put Sri Lanka on the cricket map. And you know what? Deep down, I'll quietly admit that I rated him as a cricketer.\\" Political career He entered into politics by joining the Sri Lanka Freedom Party led by Chandrika Kumaratunga, and contested the 2001 parliamentary elections with PA from Colombo District. After the UPFA victory in 2004, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Industry, Tourism and Investment Promotion. In 2010, Ranatunga left the UPFA and joined the Democratic Party of the DNA led by Sarath Fonseka, and was made the deputy leader of the Democratic Party. In November 2012, he resigned from the Democratic Party, but continued his affiliation with DNA. He endorsed Maithripala Sirisena in the 2015 Presidential election, and after Sirisena's victory Ranatunga was appointed Minister of Highways, Ports & Shipping. Career highlights ;Tests *Ranatunga's highest Test batting score of 135 not out was made against Pakistan, Colombo, 1985‚Äì1986 *His best Test bowling effort of 2 for 17 came against New Zealand, Kandy, 1983‚Äì1984 *Ranatunga's captaincy record was as follows: 56 matches, 12 wins, 19 losses, 25 draws. ;One-day Internationals *He has the record for the most runs scored by any batsman in ODI history at number 5 position (4675 runs) and also the first to score over 4500 ODI runs when batting at no 5 position.

Use within Marxism  In Marxist theory, those workers (proletarians) in the developed countries who benefit from the superprofits extracted from the impoverished workers of developing countries form an \\"aristocracy of labor\\". The phrase was popularized by Karl Kautsky in 1901 and theorized by Vladimir Lenin in his treatise on Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. According to Lenin, companies in the developed world exploit workers in the developing world where wages are much lower. The increased profits enable these companies to pay higher wages to their employees \\"at home\\" (that is, in the developed world), thus creating a working class satisfied with their standard of living and not inclined to proletarian revolution. It is a form of exporting poverty, creating an \\"exclave\\" of lower social class. Lenin contended that imperialism had prevented increasing class polarization in the developed world and argued that a workers' revolution could only begin in one of the developing countries, such as Imperial Russia. The concept of a labor aristocracy is controversial between Marxists. While the theory is formally shared by most currents that identify positively with Lenin, including the Communist International, few organizations place the theory at the center of their work. The term is most widely used in the United States, where it was popularized in the decade prior to World War I by Eugene V. Debs's Socialist Party of America and the Industrial Workers of the World. In Britain, those who hold to this theory include the Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) and the Revolutionary Communist Group. Many Trotskyists including Leon Trotsky himself and the early congresses of the Fourth International have accepted the theory of the labor aristocracy whereas others, including Ernest Mandel and Tony Cliff, considered the theory to have mistaken arguments or \\"Third Worldist\\" implications. American revolutionary socialist Charlie Post has developed a contemporary critique of the theory.The Myth of the Labor Aristocracy. Part 1 (2006). Retrieved 18 October 2009. Albanian leader and Marxist Enver Hoxha gave the following explanation for the development of the labor aristocracy following World War II:  Criticism of unions of elite workers  The term was originally coined by Mikhail Bakunin in 1872 as a criticism of the notion that organized workers are the most radical. Bakunin wrote: \\"To me the flower of the proletariat is not, as it is to the Marxists, the upper layer, the aristocracy of labor, those who are the most cultured, who earn more and live more comfortably than all the other workers\\". In the United States and Britain, the term \\"aristocracy of labor\\" is used as an implicit criticism of labor unions that have organized high-salary workers and have no interest in unionizing middle-income and lower-income employees‚Äîeven in cases where organizing the unorganized would strengthen the unions involved. These unions, it is argued, are content to remain a \\"labor aristocracy\\". Examples might include the unions of professional athletes, which have raised the wages of a certain class of already highly paid workers‚Äîprofessional athletes‚Äîbut refuse to organize other workers, including other employees of the teams they work for. It commonly charged that the Air Line Pilots Association, International, the Screen Actors Guild and a handful of other AFL‚ÄìCIO unions conform to the labor aristocracy model of trade unionism. In defense of these unions, the AFL‚ÄìCIO's jurisdictional rules may forbid such unions from organizing workers in certain occupational classes.  Criticism of craft-based business unionism  At the beginning of the 20th century in the United States, \\"most American Federation of Labor (AFL) unions did not admit unskilled mass-production workers\\".William Cahn (1972). A Pictorial History of American Labor. p. 231. Selig Perlman wrote in 1923 that skilled workers organized into craft unions were more interested in trade separatism than in labor solidarity.Selig Perlman (1922) [2011]. A History of Trade Unionism In The United States. Forgotten Books. p. 116. The craft workers were capable of demanding more from their employers due to their skills and preferred to fight separately from unskilled or semiskilled workers.Selig Perlman (1922) [2011]. A History of Trade Unionism In The United States. Forgotten Books. p. 116. In Perlman's words, the trade unions declared that their purpose was \\"to protect the skilled trades of America from being reduced to beggary\\".Selig Perlman (1922) [2011]. A History of Trade Unionism In The United States. Forgotten Books. p. 118. In 1905, many existing unions actively lobbied for racist and anti-immigration policies through the creation of the notorious Asiatic Exclusion League. That same year, a new union called the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was formed in Chicago. The IWW, also known as the Wobblies, differed from the AFL in significant ways: * The IWW organized without regard to sex, skills, race, creed, or national origin, from the very start.Stewart Bird, Dan Georgakas and Deborah Shaffer (1985). Solidarity Forever: An Oral History of the IWW. p. 140. * The AFL was craft based while the IWW inherited the tradition of industrial unionism pioneered by the Knights of Labor, the American Railway Union and the Western Federation of Miners (WFM).Melvyn Dubofsky (1987). Big Bill' Haywood. p. 20 and 33. * The IWW promoted the concept of all workers in one big union. Ever cognizant of the common practice of AFL craft unions crossing each other's picket lines, the IWW adopted the WFM's description of the AFL as the \\"American Separation of Labor\\".William Cahn (1972). A Pictorial History of American Labor. p. 201. * The IWW believed that unions needed to build a labor movement with a structure that closely mapped the industries they sought to organize. A great merger movement had swept through corporations in the period from 1899 to 1903 and labor radicals believed that \\"the unifaction of capital represented by the rise of the new trusts needed to be countered by an equally unified organization of the entire working class\\".David Brundage (1994). The Making of Western Labor Radicalism: Denver's Organized Workers, 1878-1905. p. 139.

Columbia University. p. 87.Gibbs M. Smith (1984). Joe Hill. p. 2. Eugene V. Debs wrote that \\"seasoned old unionists\\" could see that working people could not win with the labor movement they had. Debs believed the AFL practiced \\"organized scabbery\\" of one union on another, engaged in jurisdictional squabbling, was dominated by an autocratic leadership and the relationship between union leaders and millionaires in the National Civic Federation was much too cozy. IWW leaders believed that in the AFL there was too little solidarity and too little \\"straight\\" labor education. These circumstances led to too little appreciation of what could be won, and too little will to win it.Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin (1976). The IWW: Its First Seventy Years. p. 5.

Big Bill' Haywood. p. 17. The AFL therefore preached \\"pure and simple\\" trade unionism. The AFL concerned itself with a \\"philosophy of pure wage consciousness\\", according to Selig Perlman,William Cahn (1972). A Pictorial History of American Labor. p. 137. who developed the \\"business unionism\\" theory of labor. Perlman saw craft organizing as a means of resisting the encroachment of waves of immigrants. Organization that was based upon craft skills granted control over access to the job.Daniel R. Fusefeld (1985). The Rise and Repression of Radical Labor. pp. 6‚Äì7. While craft unions provided a good defense for the privileges of membership, conventions such as time-limited contracts and pledges not to strike in solidarity with other workers severely limited the ability of craft unions to effect change in society at large, leaving only the ineffectual means granted by a business-dominated elite society, i.e. electoral politics, lobbying congress and a newly enfeebled economic weapon, the injunction- circumscribed strike. However, the AFL embraced this \\"businesslike\\" and \\"pragmatic\\" worldview, adopting the motto \\"A fair day's wage for a fair day's work\\".William Cahn (1972). A Pictorial History of American Labor. p. 137 and 139. The AFL outlived the class consciousness of its own founding Preamble, but the IWW embraced the goal of abolishing wage slavery. In 1908, the IWW responded to what it considered the AFL's class collaborationist tendencies with new wording in the IWW Preamble: > Instead of the conservative motto, \\"A fair day's wage for a fair day's > work,\\" we must inscribe upon our banner the revolutionary watchword, > \\"Abolition of the wage system.\\" [...] The army of production must be > organized, not only for the every-day struggle with capitalists, but also to > carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown.\\"Constitution > and By-Laws of the Industrial Workers of the World, Preamble\\" (1908). > Retrieved 24 June 2007. The IWW saw itself as the answer to the conservatism of the AFL. The IWW developed a variety of creative tactics in its effort to \\"build a new world within the shell of the old\\".\\"Constitution and By-Laws of the Industrial Workers of the World, Preamble\\" (1908). Retrieved 24 June 2007. Because the AFL declined to act as an ally in such a cause, the Wobblies sought to develop solidarity with all rank and file workers while criticizing or spoofing AFL union leadership. AFL union \\"bosses\\" were (and still are) referred to by the Wobblies as \\"piecards\\". To the IWW, all the union bureaucracy of the AFL functioned pretty much as a \\"labor aristocracy\\". In that regard, the IWW's views have not changed much over the years. Mainstream unions have evolved, embracing some of the principles of industrial unionism and (in many cases) opening their doors to a greater spectrum of the working class. However, there are many aspects to business unionism that solidarity unionists still find suspect‚Äì a tendency to operate as a business, rather than according to \\"union principles\\"; enthroning elite hierarchies of leadership which are not easily recalled by the membership; deriving significant income from the sale of insurance or credit cards, arguably leading to conflicts of interest; union leadership compensation levels that are closer to those of corporate executives than of rank and file workers; top-down decision making; and building relationships with the leadership of corporations or political parties that the rank and file may view with suspicion. All union movements function in some fashion to raise up workers in social/economic status and/or in union privilege. The significant difference between a union movement with a labor aristocracy and a union movement based upon class solidarity is how and to what extent the structure, bureaucracy and in particular policies and practices of that union movement function, either to leave that level of increased privilege as the status quo, or to recognize the necessity of building structural relationships, promoting education and engaging in solidarity activities with the specific intention of translating gains into an effort to enhance the status of all working people.

It ran between Clifton Junction near Penrith and Kirkby Stephen via Appleby-in- Westmorland. Passenger traffic ended in 1962 and the line was reduced to the track between the junction at Appleby station with the Settle-Carlisle Line and Kirkby Stephen which served a quarry. By 1976 all that was left was of track between Appleby in Westmorland and Flitholme. It was used by infrequent British Army services to Warcop Training Area until 1989. In 1995 the Eden Valley Railway Society was formed with the aim of reinstating services and restoring on the line. Heritage railway services resumed in 2006 between Warcop and Sandford, with an extension of being opened in 2013, giving a current running line of almost . History =Background= Prior to the construction of the Eden Valley Railway, in the 1840s, several schemes had been proposed which would have run to the Eden Valley; one was the York & Carlisle Junction Railway,The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, pp.468-469 backed by the Great North of England Railway, which would have run from Northallerton to Barnard Castle then across the Pennines to Kirkby Stephen, after which two branches would have been formed to connect with the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway; one to Tebay and the other to Clifton.The North Eastern Railway, Cecil J. Allen, p.98 Another similar scheme was the Northumberland & Lancashire Union which would have run from Gateshead near Newcastle upon Tyne to Barnard Castle, and then as the York & Carlisle line across the Pennines via Kirkby Stephen to Tebay. Additionally the Yorkshire and Glasgow Union Railway was planned to run west from Thirsk through Wensleydale to Hawes, then north through the Mallerstang Valley to Kirkby Stephen, and then through the Eden Valley to Clifton via Appleby-in-Westmorland. Both the Yorkshire & Glasgow Union and part of the York & Carlisle Junction to Tebay were empowered by acts of Parliament in 1845The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, p.480 but the end of the Railway bubble of the 1840s meant that they were not built. It was not until the late 1850s that a line through the Eden Valley was proposed again. Firstly a new trans-Pennine railway line was proposed, reviving the earlier schemes; the South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway (SD&LUR;) was to run from the Stockton and Darlington RailwayThere were two connections, one from Barnard Castle (connected by the Darlington and Barnard Castle Railway), the other at Spring Garden Junction near St Helens on the Haggerleases Branch line. to Kirkby Stephen and then to Tebay. A second line, the Eden Valley Railway would branch from the first at Kirkby Stephen and then go to Clifton via the upper Eden Valley. The main purpose of these lines was freight, not passengers; bringing higher grade iron ore from Cumberland and Lancashire to the blast furnaces of the North East, and coal and coke from the mines of Durham to the northwest of England.A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain, Vol.4, pp.133-136 The route was shorter than the alternative, the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway.The North Eastern Railway, Cecil J. Allen, pp.119-121 The act of Parliament authorising South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway was passed on 13 July 1857,The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, p.561 and that for the Eden Valley Railway came soon after on 21 May 1858.

Lawton Brothers of Newcastle, the turning of the sod ceremony took place on 4 August 1858 with Lord Brougham. Most of the stone for the railway's stations was quarried near Cliburn. Construction of the line was straightforward with only three minor rivers to cross and no tunnels in low-lying land; the maximum incline was 1 in 80, the average 1 in 150.The Eden Valley Railway, Alan Dick, Part 1 The cost of construction had been ¬£204,803 0s 8d ().

Allen, p.122 whence the line ran roughly west to Cliburn railway station north of the village of Cliburn. The line then continued west, and curved south on a chord connecting it to a north facing junction near Clifton, Cumbria connecting the line to Clifton and Lowther station on the Lancaster & Carlisle Railway. The line was built as a single track line and was worked by the Stockton and Darlington Railway from its inception, it opened for mineral trains on 8 April 1862, and for passengers on 9 June the same year. =1862 to 1923: NER= 1914 Railway Clearing House diagram showing junctions at Clifton and Appleby Soon after opening the amalgamation of the railway into the Stockton and Darlington Railway along with the South Durham and Lancashire Union Railway and Frosterley and Stanhope Railway was sanctioned by an Act of Parliament on 30 June 1862.The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, p.605 The following year the Stockton and Darlington merged into the North Eastern Railway,The North Eastern Railway; its rise and development, William Weaver Tomlinson, Appendix E \\"Railway and Dock Companies merged into the North Eastern Railway\\", pp.778-9 and the Eden Valley line too became part of that larger system. During the construction of the railway, in 1861, an act of Parliament was passed that would increase the importance of the Eden Valley Line. This was the act permitting the construction of the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway, which by 1865 had been opened. It connected to the Cockermouth and Workington Railway, and hence the ports and industrialised iron-rich regions of the west Cumbrian coast (Workington, Whitehaven) were linked to the Lancaster and Carlisle line (operated by the London and North Western Railway) near Penrith close to the Eden Valley's own junction. This made the Eden Valley line a route of choice for transport of materials between the north east and north west of England. Permission to build a connection allowing trains from the north to run directly onto the Eden Valley line was obtained in 1862, and the new section opened in 1863, along with a new station for Clifton (renamed Clifton Moor in 1927) on the chord. Eden Valley passenger trains now ran via this northern track, and had running powers on the L&CR; line, now going to Penrith. After 1874 the southern chord was abandoned.\\"A Forgotten Junction in Westmorland\\", M.D. Greville, G.O. Holt, The Railway Magazine, reproduced at The Eden Valley and Stainmore Railway - Clifton & Lowther Station, via www.cumbria-railways.co.uk During the 1870s the Settle and Carlisle Railway was being constructed, which also ran through the upper Eden Valley. West of the station in Appleby in Westmorland a junction with the Eden Valley railway was built allowing trains travelling north to cross onto the westbound Eden Valley line. Further west the Settle line crossed over the Eden Valley line.The Eden Valley Railway, \\"Warcop and Appleby\\", Alan Dick, Part 3 =1923 to 1948: LNER= Between 1923 and 1948 the line was part of the London and North Eastern Railway. =1948 to 1989: British Rail= thumb In 1948 the railways of Britain were nationalised and the line became part of British Rail.

However between 1962 and 1963 the entire line closed to passengers. At the same time the Stainmore railway also closed completely apart from a short section of track eastwards from Kirkby Stephen East railway station to Merrygill Viaduct for the quarry nearby. From then on only freight trains used the line.Appleby East, Section \\"A Brief History of the Darlington to Tebay line (Stainmore) & Kirkby Stephen to Clifton line (Eden Valley)\\", www.disused-stations.org.uk The line from Clifton to Appleby was also closed, and, from 1963 points east of Appleby could only be reached via the junction with the Settle and Carlisle railway at Appleby. Freight trains still ran from Appleby to Kirkby Stephen and then to Hartley Quarry (). In 1974 that service ended and the track was removed except for about between Appleby and Warcop. Trains for the Warcop Training Area north of Warcop village ran until 1989. =The line today= The section of line between Appleby and Warcop has been restored by the Eden Valley Railway Trust, originally known as the Eden Valley Railway Society. At the southern end of the route, the Stainmore Railway Company has reinstated a short stretch of track near Kirkby Stephen East station. Other than in the restored sections, none of the track remains in situ. Most of the trackbed remains as a feature on the landscape and as field boundaries.

The company was founded by Dr. Ederyn Williams in 1984 and operated three separate labels: Firebird, Rainbird, and Silverbird. History Telecomsoft was founded in 1984 when computer games were the fastest growing sector within the computer software market at the time. Three publishing labels were initially established within Telecomsoft, each with its own marketing strategy, although some of them would later fragment to form a number of sub-labels. The Firebird label would be Telecomsoft's primary identity. Although initially set up to publish a range of budget titles, Firebird later evolved into a full price label. As a consequence the Silverbird label was formed to continue publishing the budget range. As the Atari ST and Amiga home computers grew in popularity, the Rainbird label was established to give the more complex 16-bit titles a unique brand identity, although it was also used to publish a number of high-profile 8-bit games and application software. In 1985 Telecomsoft opened the US operation which published product under licence on IBM PC. Apple II and IIe, C64 as well as Atari and Amiga titles. The US operation published the first UK product 'Elite' to the No1 spot on the Billboard charts in May 1986. Telecomsoft was viable for only a short period of time and was acquired by MicroProse in 1989. The US-based publisher sold the Silverbird label soon after acquisition, but continued to use the Rainbird and Firebird labels for a short period. =Labels= Firebird 220px Firebird was the first computer game label to be set up at Telecomsoft. It had earlier been named Firefly Software, but was then renamed because the original name was not fully protected. Initially there were two prices: Firebird Silver would release budget titles priced at ¬£2.50 whereas Firebird Gold would release more prestigious titles at ¬£5.95. The Firebird label was aimed at a teenage market, hoping to entice young spenders to spend their pocket money on good quality, low-priced games rather than records and comics. Although there were doubts as to whether or not the market could afford to sustain a range of budget titles, the Firebird Silver releases were successful. The budget software market grew as other publishers, such as Codemasters, decided to capitalise on the successful model established by Firebird and their early rival Mastertronic. Firebird Gold established itself just as well as its budget counterpart. Although the price rose to ¬£9.95, the label became synonymous with many classic 8-bit titles, such as Elite, Revs, Druid and The Sentinel. Firebird's success allowed them to acquire a number of third party developers, see Telecomsoft acquisitions below, and they also established a deal with Ultimate Play the Game, whereby they would convert and publish a number of their successful ZX Spectrum games to the Commodore 64. Later, the entire budget range was given an overhaul and relaunched as the single Firebird Silver ¬£1.99 Range. Likewise, a new Firebird Hot label was established to reintroduce mid-price games. A final overhaul of the Firebird brand was conducted in late 1987 as the budget titles became rebranded as Silverbird and the mid to full-price games as Firebird. These brands remained until MicroProse's acquisition of Telecomsoft in 1989. Silverbird 220px Rather than attempt to juggle a number of potentially confusing budget labels with the same branding as their full price software, Telecomsoft decided to consolidate and rebrand their budget labels as a single Silverbird range. Two price points were established for 8-bit software (¬£1.99 and ¬£2.99) while a few budget 16-bit titles were priced at ¬£9.99. These various price points were differentiated between by their own particular style of packaging.http://birdsanctuary.co.uk/history-silverbird-software/ Rather than simply republish their existing range of budget software, Silverbird published a range of titles that hadn't previously been released at a budget price point. This included many original new titles as well older full-price titles acquired from other publishers. Following MicroProse's acquisition of Telecomsoft, the US publisher sold off the Silverbird label to a Tudor Enterprises, a British publisher. They published a compilation pack of old Silverbird titles and a small number of original titles before closing down their software publishing operations. Rainbird 220px The Rainbird label was established by Tony Rainbird, a former Micro-Gold employee who joined Telecomsoft to help set up the Firebird label. For legal reasons, the label's original name, Bluebird, had to be changed, although it still retained Tony Rainbird's original idea of releasing all its games in striking blue packaging. The 16-bit home computer market, largely represented by the Atari ST and Amiga, was just beginning to take off in 1986 and the Rainbird label was an ideal opportunity to capitalise on it. Rather than concentrate on the more simplistic arcade action games that had dominated the 8-bit era, Rainbird aimed to introduce cutting edge simulators, adventure games and utilities to the full-price market.http://birdsanctuary.co.uk/history-rainbird-software/ Rainbird formed partnerships with a number of developers who would produce their next range of games. Magnetic Scrolls and Argonaut Software were amongst the first developers to benefit from a publishing deal with the label. Realtime Games, a successful ZX Spectrum developer who specialised in fast 3D action games, converted Starglider to the ZX Spectrum and developed Carrier Command for Rainbird. The company republished enhanced versions of adventure games by Level 9 Computing, beginning with their Middle-earth trilogy: Colossal Adventure (itself an enhanced conversion of Adventure by Will Crowther and Don Woods), Adventure Quest and Dungeon Adventure, these last two featuring the Demon Lord Agaliarept. Rainbird published this sequence as Jewels of Darknesshttp://www.crashonline.org.uk/36/jewels.htm and references to Middle-earth were expunged. Rainbird also published Level 9's Silicon Dreams trilogy: Snowball was followed by Return to Eden and The Worm in Paradise. MicroProse continued to use the Rainbird label for a number of years, after its acquisition of Telecomsoft. =Acquisitions= Beyond Software One of Telecomsoft's earliest acquisitions was Beyond Software. Originally set up by the EMAP publishing group in 1983, Beyond published numerous titles on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC, but met with very little success until the release of Mike Singleton's Lords of Midnight in 1984. The Tolkien-esque strategy game, and allowed Beyond to establish a distribution deal with American developers First Star, as well as a publishing deal with developer Denton Designs. After being acquired by Telecomsoft in late 1985Richard Hewison: Beyond. from: The Bird Sanctuary. Accessed on 2009-12-10 for a six figure sum, Beyond continued to operate as a unique label, mostly releasing games that had already been in development for some time, as well as a number of conversions of existing titles. Telecomsoft did very little with the Beyond label beyond these releases. A number of other titles, such as Star Trek: The Rebel Universe, were released on the Firebird label.

Its elevation is above sea level. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 963. It is one of only two cities in Nevada that prohibits gambling, the other being Boulder City. History The Panaca Ward Chapel (1867‚Äì1868) is the oldest building in Lincoln County. Nevada Historical Marker #93 Panaca was the first permanent settlement by European Americans in southern Nevada. It was founded as a Mormon colony in 1864. It began as part of Washington County, Utah, but the congressional redrawing of boundaries in 1866 shifted Panaca into Nevada. It is the only community in Nevada to be \\"dry\\" (forbidding the sale of alcoholic beverages), and the only community in Nevada, besides Boulder City, that prohibits gambling. Coke ovens here once produced charcoal for the smelters in nearby Bullionville (now a ghost town), but the town's economy is predominantly agricultural. The name \\"Panaca\\" comes from the Southern Paiute word Pan-nuk-ker, which means \\"metal, money, wealth\\". William Hamblin, a Mormon missionary to the Paiutes, established the Panacker Ledge (Panaca Claim) silver mine there in 1864. Geography Panaca Elementary School, 2011 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Panaca census-designated place has an area of , all of it land. Along Nevada State Route 319 it is east to the Utah state line and from there another east to Cedar City, Utah. West from Panaca it is to U.S. Route 93, at which point it is north to Pioche and south to Caliente. Attractions Panaca is near Cathedral Gorge State Park. The following Nevada historical markers have been placed in Panaca: * Panaca (#39) * Panaca Mercantile Store (#93) * Panaca Spring (#160) * Panaca Ward Chapel (#182) Panaca celebrates Pioneer Day on the Saturday closest to July 24. Events include cannon firing at 6 A.M. , games and races, a parade, art displays, and a community dinner. This coincides with the Utah holiday commemorating the arrival of the Mormon pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley.

A negotiable instrument is a document guaranteeing the payment of a specific amount of money, either on demand, or at a set time, whose payer is usually named on the document. More specifically, it is a document contemplated by or consisting of a contract, which promises the payment of money without condition, which may be paid either on demand or at a future date. The term has different meanings depending on the use of the term as it is used in the application of different laws, and depending in which country and context it is used. Concept of negotiability William Searle Holdsworth defines the concept of negotiability as follows: #Negotiable instruments are transferable under the following circumstances: they are transferable by delivery where they are made payable to the bearer, they are transferable by delivery and endorsement where they are made payable to order. #Consideration is presumed. #The transferee acquires a good title, even though the transferor had a defective or no title. Jurisdictions In the Commonwealth of Nations almost all jurisdictions have codified the law relating to negotiable instruments in a Bills of Exchange Act, e.g. Bills of Exchange Act 1882 in the UK, Bills of Exchange Act 1908 in New Zealand, Bills of Exchange Act 1909 in Australia, the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 in India and the Bills of Exchange Act 1914 in Mauritius. Additionally most Commonwealth jurisdictions have separate Cheques Acts providing for additional protections for bankers collecting unendorsed or irregularly endorsed cheques, providing that cheques that are crossed and marked 'not negotiable' or similar are not transferable, and providing for electronic presentation of cheques in inter-bank cheque clearing systems.  History  In India, during the Mauryan period in the 3rd century BCE, an instrument called adesha was in use, which was an order on a banker desiring him to pay the money of the note to a third person, which corresponds to the definition of a bill of exchange as we understand it today. The ancient Romans are believed to have used an early form of cheque known as praescriptiones in the 1st century BCE and 2,000-year-old Roman promissory notes have been found Common prototypes of bills of exchanges and promissory notes originated in China, where special instruments called feitsyan were used to safely transfer money over long distances during the reign of the Tang Dynasty in the 8th century. In about 1150 the Knights Templar issued an early form of bank notes to departing pilgrims in exchange for a deposit of valuables at a local Templar preceptory in a European country, which could be cashed by the pilgrim concerned on arrival in the Holy land, by presenting the note to a Templar preceptory there. In the mid-13th century, the Ilkhanid rulers of Persia printed the \\"cha\\" or \\"chap\\" which was used as paper money for limited usage for transactions between the court and the merchants for about three years before it collapsed. The collapse was caused by the court accepting the \\"cha\\" only at progressive discount. Later, such documents were used for money transfer by Middle Eastern merchants, who had used the prototypes of bills of exchange (\\"suftadja\\" or \\"softa\\") from the 8th century to present. Such prototypes came to be used later by the Iberian and Italian merchants in the 12th century. In Italy in the 13‚Äì15th centuries, bills of exchange and promissory notes obtained their main features, while further phases of their development have been associated with France (16‚Äì18th centuries, where the endorsement had appeared) and Germany (19th century, formalization of Exchange Law). The first mention of the use of bills of exchange in English statutes dates from 1381, under Richard II; the statute mandates the use of such instruments in England, and prohibits the future export of gold and silver specie, in any form, to settle foreign commercial transactions.Adam Anderson, An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce: from the earliest accounts to the present time. Containing, an history of the great commercial interests of the British empire..., Vol. I, p.209‚Äì210 (1764) English exchange law was different than continental European law because of different legal systems; the English system was adopted later in the United States. The modern emphasis on negotiability may also be traced to Lord Mansfield. Germanic Lombards documents may also have some elements of negotiability.  Distinguished from other types of contracts  An 1870 Bill of Exchange payable in London with British Foreign Bill revenue stamps attached. A negotiable instrument can serve to convey value constituting at least part of the performance of a contract, albeit perhaps not obvious in contract formation, in terms inherent in and arising from the requisite offer and acceptance and conveyance of consideration. The underlying contract contemplates the right to hold the instrument as, and to negotiate the instrument to, a holder in due course, the payment on which is at least part of the performance of the contract to which the negotiable instrument is linked. The instrument, memorializing: (1) the power to demand payment; and, (2) the right to be paid, can move, for example, in the instance of a \\"bearer instrument\\", wherein the possession of the document itself attributes and ascribes the right to payment. Certain exceptions exist, such as instances of loss or theft of the instrument, wherein the possessor of the note may be a holder, but not necessarily a holder in due course. Negotiation requires a valid endorsement of the negotiable instrument. The consideration constituted by a negotiable instrument is cognizable as the value given up to acquire it (benefit) and the consequent loss of value (detriment) to the prior holder; thus, no separate consideration is required to support an accompanying contract assignment. The instrument itself is understood as memorializing the right for, and power to demand, payment, and an obligation for payment evidenced by the instrument itself with possession as a holder in due course being the touchstone for the right to, and power to demand, payment. In some instances, the negotiable instrument can serve as the writing memorializing a contract, thus satisfying any applicable statute of frauds as to that contract. = The holder in due course = The rights of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument are qualitatively, as matters of law, superior to those provided by ordinary species of contracts: * The rights to payment are not subject to set-off, and do not rely on the validity of the underlying contract giving rise to the debt (for example if a cheque was drawn for payment for goods delivered but defective, the drawer is still liable on the cheque) * No notice need be given to any party liable on the instrument for transfer of the rights under the instrument by negotiation. However, payment by the party liable to the person previously entitled to enforce the instrument \\"counts\\" as payment on the note until adequate notice has been received by the liable party that a different party is to receive payments from then on. [U.C.C. ¬ß3-602(b)] * Transfer free of equities‚Äîthe holder in due course can hold better title than the party he obtains it from (as in the instance of negotiation of the instrument from a mere holder to a holder in due course) Negotiation often enables the transferee to become the party to the contract through a contract assignment (provided for explicitly or by operation of law) and to enforce the contract in the transferee-assignee's own name. Negotiation can be effected by endorsement and delivery (order instruments), or by delivery alone (bearer instruments).  Classes  Promissory notes and bills of exchange are two primary types of negotiable instruments. = Promissory note = Although possibly non-negotiable, a promissory note may be a negotiable instrument if it is an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay on demand to the payee, or at fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money, to order or to bearer. The law applicable to the specific instrument will determine whether it is a negotiable instrument or a non-negotiable instrument. Bank notes are frequently referred to as promissory notes, a promissory note made by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. According to section 4 of India's Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, \\"a Promissory Note is a writing (not being a bank note or currency note), containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker to pay a certain sum of money only to or to the order of a certain person or the bearer of the instrument\\". = Bill of exchange = A bill of exchange or \\"draft\\" is a written order by the drawer to the drawee to pay money to the payee. A common type of bill of exchange is the cheque (check in American English), defined as a bill of exchange drawn on a banker and payable on demand. Bills of exchange are used primarily in international trade, and are written orders by one person to his bank to pay the bearer a specific sum on a specific date. Prior to the advent of paper currency, bills of exchange were a common means of exchange. They are not used as often today. Bill of exchange, 1933 A bill of exchange is essentially an order made by one person to another to pay money to a third person. A bill of exchange requires in its inception three parties‚Äîthe drawer, the drawee, and the payee. The person who draws the bill is called the drawer. He gives the order to pay money to the third party. The party upon whom the bill is drawn is called the drawee. He is the person to whom the bill is addressed and who is ordered to pay. He becomes an acceptor when he indicates his willingness to pay the bill. The party in whose favor the bill is drawn or is payable is called the payee. The parties need not all be distinct persons. Thus, the drawer may draw on himself payable to his own order. A bill of exchange may be endorsed by the payee in favour of a third party, who may in turn endorse it to a fourth, and so on indefinitely. The \\"holder in due course\\" may claim the amount of the bill against the drawee and all previous endorsers, regardless of any counterclaims that may have disabled the previous payee or endorser from doing so. This is what is meant by saying that a bill is negotiable. In some cases a bill is marked \\"not negotiable\\"‚Äîsee crossing of cheques. In that case it can still be transferred to a third party, but the third party can have no better right than the transferor.  In the United States  In the United States, Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) govern the issuance and transfer of negotiable instruments, unless the instruments are governed by Article 8 of the UCC. The various state law enactments of UCC ¬ß¬ß 3‚Äì104(a) through (d) set forth the legal definition of what is and what is not a negotiable instrument: Thus, for a writing to be a negotiable instrument under Article 3, the following requirements must be met: # The promise or order to pay must be unconditional; # The payment must be a specific sum of money, although interest may be added to the sum; # The payment must be made on demand or at a definite time; # The instrument must not require the person promising payment to perform any act other than paying the money specified; # The instrument must be payable to bearer or to order. The latter requirement is referred to as the \\"words of negotiability\\": a writing which does not contain the words \\"to the order of\\" (within the four corners of the instrument or in endorsement on the note or in allonge) or indicate that it is payable to the individual holding the contract document (analogous to the holder in due course) is not a negotiable instrument and is not governed by Article 3, even if it appears to have all of the other features of negotiability. The only exception is that if an instrument meets the definition of a cheque (a bill of exchange payable on demand and drawn on a bank) and is not payable to order (i.e. if it just reads \\"pay John Doe\\") then it is treated as a negotiable instrument. UCC Article 3 does not apply to money, to payment orders governed by Article 4A, or to securities governed by Article 8. =Negotiation and endorsement = Persons other than the original obligor and obligee can become parties to a negotiable instrument. The most common manner in which this is done is by \\"endorsing\\" (from Latin dorsum, the back + inCollins Dictionary of the English Language, 2nd Edition, London, 1986, pp.504-5; Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, & Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928, p.182), that is placing one's signature on the back of the instrument‚Äîif the person who signs does so with the intention of obtaining payment of the instrument or acquiring or transferring rights to the instrument, the signature is called an endorsement. There are five types of endorsements contemplated by the Code, covered in UCC Article 3, Sections 204‚Äì206: *An endorsement which purports to transfer the instrument to a specified person is a special endorsement ‚Äì for example, \\"Pay to the order of Amy\\"; *An endorsement by the payee or holder which does not contain any additional notation (thus purporting to make the instrument payable to bearer) is an endorsement in blank or blank endorsement; *An endorsement which purports to require that the funds be applied in a certain manner (e.g. \\"\\", \\"for collection\\") is a restrictive endorsement; and, *An endorsement purporting to disclaim retroactive liability is called a qualified endorsement (through the inscription of the words \\"without recourse\\" as part of the endorsement on the instrument or in allonge to the instrument). *An endorsement purporting to add terms and conditions is called a conditional endorsement ‚Äì for example, \\"Pay to the order of Amy, if she rakes my lawn next Thursday November 15th, 2007\\". The UCC states that these conditions may be disregarded. If a note or draft is negotiated to a person who acquires the instrument #in good faith; #for value; #without notice of any defenses to payment, the transferee is a holder in due course and can enforce the instrument without being subject to defenses which the maker of the instrument would be able to assert against the original payee, except for certain real defenses. These real defenses include (1) forgery of the instrument; (2) fraud as to the nature of the instrument being signed; (3) alteration of the instrument; (4) incapacity of the signer to contract; (5) infancy of the signer; (6) duress; (7) discharge in bankruptcy; and, (8) the running of a statute of limitations as to the validity of the instrument. The holder-in- due-course rule is a rebuttable presumption that makes the free transfer of negotiable instruments feasible in the modern economy. A person or entity purchasing an instrument in the ordinary course of business can reasonably expect that it will be paid when presented to, and not subject to dishonor by, the maker, without involving itself in a dispute between the maker and the person to whom the instrument was first issued (this can be contrasted to the lesser rights and obligations accruing to mere holders). Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in a particular State's law contemplate real defenses available to purported holders in due course. The foregoing is the theory and application presuming compliance with the relevant law. Practically, the obligor-payor on an instrument who feels he has been defrauded or otherwise unfairly dealt with by the payee may nonetheless refuse to pay even a holder in due course, requiring the latter to resort to litigation to recover on the instrument. = Usage = While bearer instruments are rarely created as such, a holder of commercial paper with the holder designated as payee can change the instrument to a bearer instrument by an endorsement. The proper holder simply signs the back of the instrument and the instrument becomes bearer paper, although in recent years, third party checks are not being honored by most banks unless the original payee has signed a notarized document stating such. Alternatively, an individual or company may write a check payable to \\"cash\\" or \\"bearer\\" and create a bearer instrument. Great care should be taken with the security of the instrument, as it is legally almost as good as cash. = Exceptions = Under the Code, the following are not negotiable instruments, although the law governing obligations with respect to such items may be similar to or derived from the law applicable to negotiable instruments: * Bills of lading and other documents of title, which are governed by Article 7 of the Code. However, under admiralty law, a bill of lading may either be a negotiable or 'order' bill of lading or a nonnegotiable or 'straight' bill of lading. * Deeds and other documents conveying interests in real estate, although a mortgage may secure a promissory note which is governed by Article 3 * IOUs * Letters of credit, which are governed by Article 5 of the Code  Modern relevance  Although often considered foundational in business law, the modern relevance of negotiability has been questioned.Mann RJ (1996). Searching for Negotiability in Payment and Credit Systems. UCLA Law Review. Negotiability can be traced back to the 1700s and Lord Mansfield, when money and liquidity was relatively scarce. The holder in due course rule has been limited by various statutes. Concerns have also been raised that the holder in due course rule does not align the incentives of the mortgage originators and the assignees efficiently.Greenlee MB, Fitzpatrck IV TJ. (2008).

When the battalion was taken over by the British Army it was officially named the 10th (Service) Battalion, The Lincolnshire Regiment. It was the only 'pals battalion' to be called 'chums'. When the call came from Lord Kitchener for volunteers, the headmaster of Wintringham Grammar School in Grimsby decided to raise a 250-strong company of former pupils which would be based at the armoury of the school's Officer Training Corps. The company was offered to the local Territorial Force unit, the 5th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment, but by then the battalion was full.Maj-Gen C. R. Simpson (ed), The History of the Lincolnshire Regiment 1914‚Äì1918, London: Medici Society, 1931//Uckfield: Naval & Military Press, 2002, , pp. 53‚Äì4. When other Grimsby men expressed a wish to join, the process was handed over to the town council which set about recruiting sufficient men to form an entire battalion for 'Kitchener's Army'.Lincolns at Long, Long Trail. Men were accepted from neighbouring towns such as Boston, Louth and Scunthorpe. In order to complete the battalion, a group was sent from Wakefield in Yorkshire. The Grimsby Chums joined the 101st Brigade of the 34th Division where they were joined by the two battalions of the Edinburgh City Pals. The division moved to France in January 1916 and first saw action in the Battle of the Somme. On 1 July 1916, the first day on the Somme, the Grimsby Chums were in the first wave attacking the fortified village of La Boisselle, just south of the Albert‚ÄìBapaume road. To aid their attack, a massive mine, known as the Lochnagar mine, was detonated beneath the German trenches at 7.28 am, two minutes before Zero hour. At 7.30 am, the Grimsby Chums rushed forward to occupy the crater. Here many were trapped for the rest of the day, harassed by both German and British artillery.Martin Middlebrook, The First Day on the Somme, 1 July 1916, London: Allen Lane 1971/Fontana, 1975, . A few of the Grimsby Chums made it into the German trenches. The only officer to make it was 2nd Lieutenant Harold P. Hendin who led five men to the German reserve trench (the third trench in the front-line system) and, gathering stragglers as the day progressed, he held off a series of German counter-attacks before having to retire. In total the Grimsby Chums suffered 502 casualties on 1 July; 15 officers and 487 other ranks. Only two of the officers came back unwounded, and only about 100 men. In February 1918 the battalion moved to the 103rd Brigade, 34th Division. The 10th Battalion was disbanded on 3 June 1919. A memorial in St James' Church, Grimsby, was erected to the memory of the 810 members of the 10th (Service) Battalion who were killed in action or died on service.

It is native to much of Sub-Saharan Africa, the Nile Delta and Madagascar. It is thought to be mainly monogamous and has monomorphic plumage. Description Illustration by Heinrich von Kittlitz, after whom the species is named Kittlitz's plover is a small shorebird weighing between 35-40 grams.Hockey, P.A.R., Dean, W.R.J. and Ryan, P. G. 2005. Roberts ‚Äì Birds of Southern Africa. The Trustees of the John Voelcker Bird Book Fund. Both male and female have a black bill, dark brown eyes with black eyelids and black legs, although sometimes the legs can appear greenish or grey. During the breeding season, the male has a white forehead, a blackish bar followed by a narrow white bar on the forecrown, whereas the rest of the crown is brown with sandy tips to the feathers. A black stripe - separated from the crown by a white superciliary stripe - runs from the bill through the eye and extends to the side of the neck forming a collar across the upper mantle. The mantle is dark grey-brown, the other upperparts are sooty brown with feathers having sandy rufous margins. The face, the chin and the upper throat are white and the rest of the underparts are yellowish, the belly is pale. Kittlitz's Plover has blackish central tail feathers that get continuously lighter towards the side of the tail; the outer one or two pairs are completely white. The female plumage is similar to the male's, only the black band across the forecrown is narrower. The non-breeding plumage does not differ much from the breeding one, the eye stripe is browner, the frontal bar is missing and the underparts are a lot paler. In general, adult wing length lies between 100‚Äì110 mm, adult bill length between 15‚Äì23 mm and adult tarsus length between 26‚Äì33 mm.Urban, E.K., C.H. Fry & S. Keith 1986: The birds of Africa, Vol. II. - Academic Press, London Juvenile Kittlitz's plovers appear similar to adults, however the black face marks are lacking, the upperparts are brown, the hindneck collar is buff and the underparts are white.Zefania S.

London, UK: Bloomsbury Publishing; 2013. pp. 395‚Äì403 Distribution, movement and habitat =Distribution= Kittlitz's plover is distributed throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa, but is also native to Madagascar and the Nile River Delta.Urban, E.K., C.H. Fry & S. Keith 1986: The birds of Africa, Vol. II. - Academic Press, London. A genetic study reported genetic differentiation between Madagascar and the mainland population. It is common in South Africa, however rarer in arid regions of Botswana and Namibia. In Namibia, it mostly inhabits coastal regions, highlands and Ovamboland.Tree AJ 1997.

It is more scarce in the southern lowveld of South Africa and patchy in the interior of KwaZulu-Natal and the eastern Cape. Usually it avoids mountains or densely wooded areas. The Malagasy population might result from a relatively recent immigration from mainland Africa, whereas the Madagascar plover (Charadrius thoracius) might have evolved from an earlier Kittlitz's plover population. The two species are clearly distinct and can not interbreed. Birds from Madagascar are in general smaller than birds from continental Africa. Kittlitz's plovers are heavier and have longer wings in South Africa compared to Madagascar, whereas Egyptian specimens have longer wings and shorter tarsi than in Madagascar.Cramp, S. (Ed.) 1983. The Handbook of the Birds of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Oxford. However, they are still regarded as the same species in the absence of apparent plumage difference.Benson, C.W., Colebrook-Robjent, J.F., Williams, J.F. 1976, Contribution √† l‚Äôornithologie de Madagascar. L‚ÄôOiseau et R.F.O., 46(1) pp. 209-242. In Madagascar, Kittlitz's plover is both a breeding resident and intra-island migrant and has been recorded mostly below 950 m,Rand, A.L. 1936. A summary of the fieldnotes of the Mission Zoologique Franco-Anglo-Am√©ricaine √† Madagascar: The distribution and habits of Madagascar birds. Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 27(1) pp. 134-499. although it has been recorded at up to 1,400 m too. =Movements= In the Maasai Mara, Kenya The African populations are partially sedentary in coastal areas, but mostly nomadic or migratory with their movements varying between years in response to rainfall.Delany, S., Scott, D., Dodman, T. & Stroud, D. (eds) 2009. An Atlas of Wader Populations in Africa and Western Eurasia. Wetlands International, Wageningen, The Netherlands. There is limited evidence for comparable variation in Madagascar. In the lower Mangoky basin for instance, they are thought to be resident, whereas at the Lake Tsimanampetsotsa, ringed adults have been recorded to have moved 113 km to Ifaty. =Habitat= Kittlitz's plover can be both found in inland and coastal regions. It favours open habitats at low elevation, often dry ground (open dry mud) with very short grass, mostly in close proximity to water. It breeds at lakes, alkaline grasslands, lagoons, rivers, tidal mudflats or inland saltmarshes and artificial water bodies including commercial salt pans, but generally avoids sandy or rocky beaches. In the eastern and western Cape, some populations move to estuarine mudflats during the winter, probably because of reduced competition from Palearctic migrants but also to avoid food shortage due to harsh interior winters. They are strictly terrestrial, feeding, nesting, preening and roosting solely on the ground. Voice The Kittlitz's Plover's calls include ‚Äòpipip‚Äô, ‚Äòtowhit‚Äô, ‚Äòtit-peep‚Äô, ‚Äòtrit-tritritritrit‚Äô, ‚Äòperrup‚Äô and ‚Äòkich-kich-kich‚Äô. They give alarm calls when in danger or when flushed, which include ‚Äòchirrt‚Äô, hard ‚Äòtrip‚Äô, ‚Äòtric‚Äô, ‚Äòprrrt‚Äô or plaintive ‚Äòpip-ip‚Äô.Hayman, P., J. Marchant and T. Prater. 1986. Shorebirds: An Identification Guide to the waders of the world. Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston. 412pp. During fights, the males give a buzzy call in aggressive or courtship chases,Snow, D.W.; Perrins, C.M. 1998. The Birds of the Western Palearctic, Volume 1: Non-Passerines. Oxford University Press, Oxford. When male or female are feigning injury, they give a ‚Äòcheep- cheep‚Äô and when a parent is inviting the young to brood, it gives a ‚Äòchip- chip‚Äô and the young are being warned with a ‚Äòtrr-trr‚Äô. The call of a young is a thin ‚Äòpeep‚Äô. Feeding Kittlitz's plover forages in a typical run-stop- search fashion, meaning it runs around, stops suddenly to peck at an item and then continues running. Sometimes, an individual stands erect with one foot vibrating on the surface (foot-trembling), then lunges forward to catch any prey that has been attracted to the surface. This behaviour has not been reported in Madagascar. They feed day and night (on moonlit nights until 11PM) often in groups of 2-5 individuals or in small mixed flocks together with other small waders like the Calidris species. When foraging, they can show an aggressive behaviour, especially towards conspecifics and species with similar diets, e.g. curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea) or common ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula). The aggression increases with density and is particularly high in the winter months before breeding. They mainly feed on insects, especially beetles, insect larvae, spiders, small crustaceans and molluscs. Most of their food is small, but they were recorded to have taken a cricket that was about 40 mm long. Behaviour Juvenile Kittlitz's plover in Madagascar Typical cryptic nest of a Kittlitz's plover in Madagascar Ringed Kittlitz's plover chick in Madagascar The species is social in the non- breeding season and stays in small flocks of about 20 individuals, however it has also been reported in larger flocks of 100-300 individuals during migratory movements.del Hoyo, J., Elliott, A., and Sargatal, J. 1996. Handbook of the Birds of the World, vol. 3: Hoatzin to Auks. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona, Spain. =Breeding and territories= Kittlitz's Plover has a flexible breeding system and shorter duration of pair bond than other plover species (ZS and TS, unpublished data). It is thought to be mainly monogamous and the pairing usually occurs around 2‚Äì4 weeks before the couple occupies their territory. Copulation and feeding both take place in the territories, which can occupy 3600-4200m¬≤. The parents are highly defensive of their territories until the chicks hatch. When intruders invade their territory representing a threat, the parents run after them, stopping shortly in front of them, taking on an upright posture with their legs almost straight and their head up. =Courtship= The initial courtship takes place on ‚Äòneutral‚Äô ground.Tree AJ. 1974. A comparative ecological study of the Kittlitz Plover and Treble-banded Plover at Lake McIlwaine. MSc thesis, University of Rhodesia, Salisbury. and consists of a scrape-ceremony, where one bird is placing its breast on the sand, then rotating around on the breast, whilst having its tail raised and kicking out sand with back- and forward movements of its legs. Usually, the male takes the initiative of making several scrapes (although sometimes both parents take turns in making them) and then the female probably chooses the final nest site.Clark, A. 1986a: Some observations on the breeding behaviour of Kittlitz‚Äôs Sandplover, Ostrich 53: pp. 120-2. Both parents pick up pebbles or break off bits of dead vegetation as nest material to line the nest with. =Nesting and incubation= The Kittlitz's Plover is a ground-nesting shorebird, that breeds throughout the whole year, although there are varying peak seasons in different geographic locations. Copulation usually occurs 6‚Äì11 days before egg-laying on or near the nest scrape. The simple nest scrape is usually made 50‚Äì100 m away from water on open, dry ground at low elevation, from where it is easy to spot intruders. It is about 10‚Äì15 cm in diameter and is lined with shells, pebbles, animal dung and fragments of vegetation. The Kittlitz's Plovers usually nest solitary or in loose flocks with their nests being mostly more than 40 m apart, however they can be sometimes as close as 8 m.Hockey P.A.R. & Douie, C. 1995. Waders of southern Africa. Struik Winchester. Cape Town. Sometimes the old scrape may be reused, probably by the same pair. Kittlitz's Plovers lays 1-3 eggs (usually 2) at 1-2 day intervals. They eggs are oval, dark grey-maroon with black speckles giving and overall sand-coloured or light brown background. Incubation starts once the clutch is completed and is carried out by both parents - usually by the male at night and by the female during the day - for a period of 21‚Äì27 days.S. Zefania, R. ffrench-Constant, P.R. Long, T. Sz√©kely: Breeding distribution and ecology of the endangered Madagascar plover Charadrius thoracicus. Ostrich, 79 (2008), pp. 43‚Äì51 When a parent leaves the nest during the day or when the nest is approached by a predator, the parent usually covers the eggs up to two thirds or completely with sand within 3-90 s by moving several times around the nest kicking its feet alternately. Newly or partly hatched chicks also get covered. Sometimes the eggs might be left unattended up to 5‚Äì7 hours. When the parent returns to the nest, it uncovers the nest before pursuing incubation. =Parental care= Once the young have hatched, both parents remove eggshells from nest site. Newly hatched young are downy, their upper parts are grey to white, their back is mottled with a dark median stripe and their underparts are white. The chicks leave the nest within a few hours of hatching or may be brooded on the nest for up to 24 hours. The chicks are precocial and can feed for themselves from 24 hours after hatching; one parent usually leads them to foraging areas up to 1 km away from the nest. Kittlitz's plovers exhibit uniparental care, where only one parent (either male or female) stays with the young and broods them in frequent intervals until they can fly at 26‚Äì32 days. The parent calls the chicks when inviting them to brood or when danger is present. The parents actively defend their young against conspecifics or intruders by a) feigning injury to attract more attention on themselves by lying flat on the ground, flapping their wings in a helpless manner, fanning their tail or running away or towards intruder, b) false brooding or c) running with head held low, tail drooped and spread wings. Chicks and juveniles obtain adult plumage after one year, and some may start breeding at that age. Conservation =Status and trends= The IUCN classifies Kittlitz's plover as Least Concern. The species is abundant in Africa and locally common in Madagascar, and it has a very wide range. Although not much is known about population trends due to difficulties in assessing the impact of habitat modifications, any declines appear to be below the threshold that would be identified as threatening. Kittlitz's Plover is locally very abundant in East, South and Central Africa, with a population size estimated at 100,000-400,000 individuals. West Africa is estimated to sustain 20,000-50,000 individuals. In Madagascar, the population is estimated at 10,000-20,000 individuals, making the species locally common. =Threats= Kittlitz's plover is mainly threatened by habitat loss due to wetland degradation.Ntiamoa-Baidu, Y. 1991. Seasonal changes in the importance of coastal wetlands in Ghana for wading birds. Biological Conservation 57: 139-158. For example, one of the key wetland sites in southern Africa, Walvis Bay in Namibia, has been subject to degradation and destruction due to the building of roads, disturbance from tourists and wetland reclamation for the development of suburbs and ports.Wearne, K.; Underhill, L. G. 2005. Walvis Bay, Namibia: a key wetland for waders and other coastal birds in southern Africa. Wader Study Group Bulletin 107: 24-30. In Ghana, wetlands are threatened by coastal erosion and developments that include drainage and wetland reclamation The fraction of the population migrating via the east Atlantic is vulnerable to avian malaria and would be greatly threatened in case of an outbreak of this disease. The same applies to avian botulism, which the Kittlitz's plover is susceptible to.Mendes, L.; Piersma, T.; Lecoq, M.; Spaans, B.; Ricklefs, E. 2005. Disease-limited distributions? Contrasts in the prevalence of avian malaria in shorebird species using marine and freshwater habitats. Oikos 109: 396-404.Blaker, D. 1967. An outbreak of Botulinus poisoning among waterbirds.

The capitulum, which has the appearance of a single flower, is actually composed of hundreds of individual flowers. The morphology of the flowers varies depending on their position in the capitulum. The flower heads can be as small as 7 cm (Gerbera mini 'Harley') in diameter or up to 12 cm (Gerbera ‚ÄòGolden Serena‚Äô). Gerbera is very popular and widely used as a decorative garden plant or as cut flowers. The domesticated cultivars are mostly a result of a cross between Gerbera jamesonii and another South African species Gerbera viridifolia. The cross is known as Gerbera hybrida. Thousands of cultivars exist. They vary greatly in shape and size. Colours include white, yellow, orange, red, and pink. The centre of the flower is sometimes black. Often the same flower can have petals of several different colours. Gerbera is also important commercially. It is the fifth most used cut flower in the world (after rose, carnation, chrysanthemum, and tulip). It is also used as a model organism in studying flower formation. Gerbera contains naturally occurring coumarin derivatives. Gerbera is a tender perennial plant. It is attractive to bees, butterflies, and birds, but resistant to deer. Small ones are called gerbrinis. ; SpeciesFlann, C (ed) 2009+ Global Compositae Checklist ; Formerly included Numerous species once considered members of Gerbera are now regarded as more suited to other genera: Chaptalia, Leibnitzia, Mairia, Perdicium, Trichocline, and Uechtritzia.

E-Plus was a mobile telecommunications operator in Germany. With more than 25 million subscribers, E-Plus was the third largest mobile operator in Germany, until the takeover from Telef√≥nica Germany in October, 2014.  Ownership  E-Plus was owned by Dutch telecommunications operator KPN since 2002. In July 2013, Telef√≥nica Germany announced a planned takeover. The deal was approved by KPN shareholders in October 2013. The merger was delayed because of concerns by the European Commission on reduced competition in the German mobile market. In July 2014, the European Commission approved the merger, conditional on E-Plus giving up some frequencies and network capacity.https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-approves-telefonicas- takeover-of-e-plus-1404295263  Network  = First GSM license = The company was awarded Germany's first DCS-1800 (later renamed GSM-1800, also known as E-Netz (de; lit. E-Network) in Germany) license in 1993. One term of the licence was that no further Mobile network operator could be started within 3 years of the start of the network. The network started operation as a \\"metropolitan\\" network, with coverage only in the biggest cities, in 1994. The coverage area was expanded rapidly, but for years the network's image was hampered by the view that its coverage was lacking. As a countermeasure, voicemail retrieval was free of charge for the first of years of operation, and calls were billed in six-second increments (in contrast to the one-minute increments of the other networks); after text messaging was introduced, it too was free for some time. E-Plus was the second network in Germany to offer prepaid tariffs to its customers (after T-Mobile's XtraCard) and later introduced HSCSD, which boosts data rates on GSM networks to analogue modem speed levels. Shortly after that, E-Plus upgraded its network to support GPRS. They now also operate a 3G UMTS network. = Developments since 2006 = In February 2006, after the EGSM900-band, which was in military use before, had become available in late 2005, the German regulation authority Bundesnetzagentur assigned two 2 x 5 MHz channels to E-Plus and O2 Germany. In return, E-Plus and O2 Germany had to give up some GSM1800 frequencies to two competitive operators T-Mobile and Vodafone. The first EGSM900-base stations (cell sites) started operation in April 2006. In March 2007 E-Plus outsourced deployment, management and maintenance of its network to Alcatel-Lucent and thereby transferred 750 employees to the latter company. E-Plus provides network access to numerous virtual operators, such as Base, Blau Mobilfunk, ALDI Talk, Simyo, VIVA, JambaSIM. It also owns and operates AY YILDIZ, a mobile brand aimed at the Turks in Germany, offering affordable calls to Turkey and roaming in Turkish networks. E-Plus was the first company to introduce i-mode in Germany. At the end of February 2014, E-Plus and ZTE announced that ZTE would take over Managed Services of E-Plus. On March 5. 2014, E-Plus started commercial LTE service in Berlin, Leipzig and Nuremberg by using 10 MHz out possible of 20 MHz bandwidth of the 1800 MHz frequency. On March 12. 2014, E-Plus announced the launch of HD Voice. On July 1. 2016, LTE was shutdown from the new owner Telef√≥nica Germany.

Chokut≈ç typically come in hira-zukuri and kiriha-zukuri tsukurikomi (blade styles) which make them very distinct from later tachi and katana which rarely use these forms. The distinctive feature of the chokut≈ç is the straight blade, similar to the ancient Chinese swords found in China around the 2nd century BCE to the 10th century CE. Though curved blades are as old as the sword itself, they did not become widespread in Asia and the Middle East until after the dominance of the Mongol Empire. Japanese warriors of the Kamakura Shogunate experienced the effectiveness and lethality of curved blades firsthand during the Mongol invasions of Japan. Rudimentary forms what would eventually become the tachi gradually began to eclipse the chokut≈ç in popularity as the curved blades demonstrated greater ease of handling and lethality in mounted combat.

The album cover features the debut appearance of the band's \\"SP\\" logo. The cover art was created by Vancouver based artist Jim Cummins. The artwork for this album and its associated singles was inspired by cosmic horror stories such as the Cthulhu Mythos. The album was recorded \\"spontaneously\\" at Mushroom Studios and mixed at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia. Though guitar is used throughout, the album takes a step back from the Ministry-inspired direction of the band's previous release, favoring instead a more chaotic, electronic sound. Two of the album's songs, \\"Tormentor\\" and \\"Spasmolytic\\", were released as singles, the latter of which was accompanied by a music video. Guest performers on the album include Canadian music producer Greg Reely and Skinny Puppy's longtime producer Dave \\"Rave\\" Ogilvie playing guitar on the songs \\"Nature's Revenge\\" and \\"T.F.W.O.\\". Since its release, Too Dark Park has received generally positive reviews from critics. The album has been commended for its haunting electronic riffs and use of sampling, though some have noted that the music's disturbing nature could be off-putting to some listeners. The group promoted the album with the Too Dark Park tour, which encompassed much of the United States and Canada. Though a live album has never been released, some live recordings from the tour have been featured on other Skinny Puppy releases, namely Brap: Back and Forth Series 3 & 4 and the \\"Spasmolytic\\" single. Background Following its production, the members of the band maintained that they were satisfied with their fifth full-length studio effort, 1989's Rabies. In 1990, keyboardist Dwayne Goettel stated the following regarding the band's attitude towards the album: \\"we all like it, and I can see the worry in people's eyes, but it doesn't worry us. We did it, and we like it, and I'm not worried about doing another just like it, you know?\\" He proclaimed Rabies to be his favorite out of all other Skinny Puppy albums and went on to say that he would not mind \\"doing another just like it\\". Goettel told Karen Woods of Alternative Press that he didn't feel \\"trapped\\" by the direction taken on Rabies and went on to say that \\"it [the album] may have been hanging around in the same territory as Ministry, but we were just crossing paths\\". These kinds of sentiments would, however, not last for long. Goettel revealed in 1991 that he had changed his position concerning Rabies, stating that while some of the material present on the album was \\"great\\", the completed product was \\"less within the Skinny Puppy vision\\". Goettel even went on to criticize the album's cover art and made mention of how the group had begun to receive fan mail inquiring as to whether Skinny Puppy was becoming a \\"hardcore\\" group. cEvin Key (drums/keyboards) claimed that he had been dubious about the album's production from the start. Key claimed that he had been \\"pissed off\\" with regards to singer/songwriter Nivek Ogre's apparent partiality for Ministry over Skinny Puppy, but stated that he acknowledged why Ogre had made this choice (it being a change of pace for Ogre). Of all the troubles with Rabies, Key was most displeased with Al Jourgensen's role in the recording process, claiming that he believed Jourgensen's intention during production was to try and break up the band. Ogre himself was unhappy with Rabies, declaring that he felt he had \\"flopped\\" during its production. Ogre went on to proclaim the following concerning his experience: \\"I was really unsure of myself and unsure of what I wanted to say and do. The work and artistic environment really weren't there at all either. It was completely negative\\". Following the completion of Rabies, the three band members began to explore various side projects. Ogre went on tour with Ministry, playing keyboard and providing vocals (Ogre can be seen and heard on the In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up video and CD). Ogre also provided vocals for the Revolting Cocks (a Ministry side project) album Beers, Steers, and Queers. Key and Goettel pursued a number of different projects during this time. The first of which was Hilt, a collaboration with Don Harrison of the Sons of Freedom and vocalist Al Nelson. Dave \\"Rave\\" Ogilvie was also a part of the project. Doubting Thomas was the second Key and Geottel project, featuring primarily instrumental compositions. The third and final project was titled Cyberaktif. Cyberaktif was a collaboration between Key and Bill Leeb from the band Front Line Assembly, with Goettel acting predominantly as a support musician. The focus on these projects led to speculation that Skinny Puppy had disbanded. Steven Gilmore, Skinny Puppy's long time art director, had claimed during an interview with Key and Ogre that Sire Records had relayed to MTV that the group was no more; Ogre asserted that \\"it's a lot of talk and talk can only be justified when it's actually seen\\". The energy and enthusiasm generated from this diverse array of side projects would ultimately culminate into what would become the Too Dark Park record, which Key described as \\"the follow up to the last pure Puppy album\\", VIVIsectVI. Production and music Nivek Ogre had been invited to join the Revolting Cocks on tour in 1990, having previously provided vocals on their 1988 tour. Ogre declined the offer, explaining his reason why to Alternative Press in 1991: With Ogre no longer committed to the Revolting Cocks tour and all side projects taken on by Key and Goettel completed, Skinny Puppy reassembled in studio to begin production on a new album. Goettel stated that the intention in making Too Dark Park was, in a way, an effort to reassess \\"everything\\" about Skinny Puppy. Key indicated that by fixing the mistakes that had been made on the previous record, there would then be the opportunity to return to the band's original aspirations. The group aimed for their first album of the 1990s to have a new sound and achieved this by taking what had worked well for them in the previous decade and incorporated it with fresh ideas. This also meant hiring a new art director, Jim Cummins, as Goettel had explained that the band's album artwork had been \\"stagnating\\". Nivek Ogre performing on the Too Dark Park tour On the origins of the album's title, Key has stated that it was meant to be a rhyme on words. He mentions that during the writing process, the band took notice to the fact that the material they were coming up with was becoming \\"really dark\\" and thus crafted the title Too Dark Park. The album explores a number of concepts, especially those pertaining to environmental degradation and the self-destruction of humanity. Ogre described the basis for the album's underlying message as the following: \\"that feeling of going down a road with the knowledge that you're breaking down. Yet you continue to travel down that road.\\" The album also explores more personal territory, particularly Ogre's dealings with heroin. Ogre revealed to Alternative Press how he had nearly been arrested for possession while working in Chicago and how that incident had nearly brought his career to an end. As is typical for the band, the music contains an array of samples from horror films, television shows, and documentaries. The song \\"Convulsion\\" contains samples from the 1967 documentary LSD-25 as well as from the Japanese erotic horror anime Legend of the Overfiend (the sound effects heard at the beginning of the song). \\"Tormentor\\" contains a line from the Bob Clark's 1987 film From the Hip. \\"Natures Revenge\\" samples the 1989 film Communion while \\"Shore Lined Poison\\" samples the 1967 film The Trip. The song \\"Morpheus Laughing\\" contains a sample of actor Bruce Willis saying the line \\"they appeared to me as if in a dream\\" from a Wayne's World skit on Saturday Night Live. The song \\"T.F.W.O.\\" features the line \\"you have to fuck life\\" from the 1973 horror film Flesh for Frankenstein and \\"Reclamation\\" contains samples from the 1988 horror film Hellbound: Hellraiser II and the 1978 animated adaptation of Watership Down. The album was produced by cEvin Key and Dave Ogilvie, and recorded at Mushroom Studios with the additional aid of Ken Marshall. The album was mixed at Little Mountain Sound Studios by Ken Marshall, Dave Ogilvie, and Greg Reely. Release Too Dark Park was released worldwide on October 30, 1990. For its initial release, the CD featured a full color fold out booklet on which the liner notes were printed. Later pressings featured a stapled booklet with only the front cover being colored in. The 1998 and 2004 reissue once again contain the full color fold out booklet, with somewhat reworked artwork and disc design. The initial pressing released in the UK had the same catalogue number as pressings released in the US; \\"printed in the U.S.A.\\" was digitally edited to read \\"printed in the U.K.\\". In the US, Capital Records promoted the album's release by distributing cardboard masks based on the monsters featured in Jim Cummins' cover artwork. The song \\"Tormentor\\" was released as a single and featured an alternative version of the song \\"Nature's Revenge\\" as well as the B-side \\"Bark\\". \\"Spasmolytic\\" was released as a single in 1991; a music video was produced for commercial airplay. A VHS version of the video was distributed for use in dance clubs and video shows. Critical reception Too Dark Park was well received upon its release in 1990, with critics like Spin magazine's Staci Bonner declaring the record to be the band's \\"return to the bloodbath\\". Bonner gave the most praise to the album's sampling, calling the technique's use \\"artful\\", and concluded that \\"you can be a 'spun web deluded of life' or a 'crushed velvet corpse' because with Skinny Puppy, everyday is Halloween.\\" Jean Carey of the Tampa Bay Times praised the album, describing it as the band's \\"watershed moment\\", and calling attention to the \\"vaguely central theme\\" of environmental destruction. Steven Perez of the Tampa Tribune also took note of the album's \\"environmental kick\\", saying Too Dark Park's \\"impressiveness lies beyond the mirage of its droning industrial instrumentation\\". Sandra A. Garcia of B-Side magazine also spoke highly of the record, calling it \\"superb\\" and a \\"step regained\\" following Rabies. Garcia described the album as \\"dark and dense\\", and declared that the band was once again in full control of their music. Alex Henderson of AllMusic gave the album four and a half stars, describing it a \\"forceful and consistently abrasive\\", but at the same time danceable. Henderson approved of the album's \\"twisted\\" sampling, distorted synth work, and use of guitar, and concluded that while the album was a must have for fans of industrial music, newcomers may be put off by its chaotic sound and would find it best to start off with the genre's more accessible offerings. Daniel Lukes of Kerrang! described the album as \\"controlled chaos at its most unsettling\\" and that it reflected Skinny Puppy at the height of their creativity. Trouser Press magazine described Too Dark Park as \\"environmentally minded\\" and likened the gloomy musical style employed on the songs \\"Nature's Revenge\\" and \\"Morpheus Laughing\\" to those of new wave acts such as Joy Division and Gary Numan. In a mixed review for The Morning Call, Diana Valois said the album was \\"harsher in parts\\" than the band's previous releases, and approved of the songs \\"Nature's Revenge\\" and \\"Rash Reflection\\" for \\"rising above the muddled, angry morass\\". Billboard also gave the album a mixed review, stating that while fans of alternative music would enjoy it, there was not much to offer that couldn't be found in other, more accessible groups such as Ministry. Not all critics were as receptive to Too Dark Park. In a negative review for the Calgary Herald, Mark Tremblay likened the band to an \\"environmental punk version of Hawkwind\\". Mitchell May of the Chicago Tribune awarded the album two out of four stars, saying that \\"not only do they apparently care very little about actually selling records, but they openly defy the listener to like them.\\" Gigen Mammoser of Vice noted that Too Dark Park was \\"the rejection of a genre headed increasingly towards mainstream acceptance.\\" Mammoser described the album as \\"frightening\\" and likened it to a mental disorder. Though he had mixed feelings towards the album, Mammoser admitted to \\"dusting it off\\" for a listen on certain occasions. In 2013, Francois Marchand of the Vancouver Sun named Too Dark Park one of the best albums to come out of Mushroom Studios, describing it as a \\"nightmarish vortex of hard-hitting electronic rock\\". In 2018, Metal Hammer placed Too Dark Park on their list of the 10 best industrial albums, describing its \\"dance-floor beats\\" and \\"raw screaming noise\\" as the antithesis of the techno scene.

A confection made from the root since ancient Egyptian times evolved into today's marshmallow treat, but most modern marshmallow treats no longer contain any marsh-mallow root. Description The stems, which die down in the autumn, typically grow , but can reach and put out only a few lateral branches.Martin Crawford, How to grow Perennial Vegetables, Green Books, 2012 The leaves are shortly petioled, roundish, ovate-cordate, long, and about 1 inch broad, entire or three to five lobed, irregularly toothed at the margin, and thick. They are soft and velvety on both sides, due to a dense covering of stellate hairs. The flowers are shaped like those of the common mallow, but are smaller and of a pale colour, and are either axillary, or in panicles, more often the latter. The stamens are united into a tube, the anthers, kidney-shaped and one-celled. The flowers are in bloom during August and September, and are followed, as in other species of this order, by the flat, round fruit which are popularly called \\"cheeses\\". The common mallow is frequently called \\"marsh mallow\\" in colloquial terms, but the true marsh mallow is distinguished from all the other mallows growing in Great Britain by the numerous divisions of the outer calyx (six to nine cleft), by the hoary down which thickly clothes the stems and foliage, and by the numerous panicles of blush-coloured flowers, paler than the common mallow. The roots are perennial, thick, long and tapering, very tough and pliant, whitish yellow outside, white and fibrous within. The generic name, Althaea, is derived from the Greek (to cure), from its supposed healing properties. The name of the family, Malvaceae, is derived from the Latin ', a generic name for the mallows and the source of the English common name mallow. Most of the mallows have been used as food, and are mentioned by early classic writers with this connection. Mallow was an edible vegetable among the Romans; a dish of marsh mallow was one of their delicacies. Prospero Alpini stated in 1592 that a plant of the mallow kind was eaten by the Egyptians. Many of the poorer inhabitants of Syria subsisted for weeks on herbs, of which marshmallow is one of the most common. When boiled first and fried with onions and butter, the roots are said to form a palatable dish,Grieve. A Modern Herbal.

It has an area of 1.35 square kilometres. The uninhabited island is a rhyolite lava dome, rising to 180 metres above the lake surface. It was formed after the Rotorua caldera collapsed and rhyolitic magma was pushed through the cracks. One of the cracks was below where Mokoia island is today. The foreshores of the island have geothermal springs with hot spring water forming the Hinemoa pool, known to locals as Waikimihia. It also has very rich volcanic soil, which was why the local MƒÅori grew kumara on it. It was also a very good strategic location, which was why it was often fought over. Mokoia Island is privately owned by local MƒÅori iwi, who run it in conjunction with the New Zealand Department of Conservation. It is a bird sanctuary and access is limited to tour parties only. It is home to several rare species, including the North Island kokako, the North Island brown kiwi, and a breeding population of the endangered North Island saddleback. The island is also the location of regular Mau rƒÅkau training camps in the Maori martial art of taiaha. Hinemoa and T≈´tƒÅnekai The island is sacred to MƒÅori of the Te Arawa iwi, and is the location of one of the most famous legends of New Zealand, that of Hinemoa and T≈´tƒÅnekai, which has parallels with the classical Greek tale of Hero and Leander. According to legend, the two lovers were forbidden to marry, and Hinemoa's father Umukaria, a chief from the shores of the lake, ordered that she not be allowed to travel by canoe to T≈´tƒÅnekai's tribal village on the island. Hinemoa decided to swim 3.2 kilometres across the lake to the island, guided by the sound of T≈´tƒÅnekai's flute-playing. For flotation she wrapped rushes (a type of reed) around her and swam her way to the island.The legend of Hinemoa and Tutanekai at RotoruaNZ.com According to another version, she made a flotation device from gourds. The Te Arawa version of the widely known traditional Maori love song \\"Pokarekare Ana\\" references the story of Hinemoa and T≈´tƒÅnekai.

History Port O'Connor was laid out in the late 19th century as a fishing settlement called \\"Alligator Head\\". As it grew in popularity with both permanent residents and tourists, the community took on more municipal characteristics, earning the formal designation finally in 1909 as the town site of Port O'Connor.

Its initial population growth spanned the years 1909 to 1919. Excursion trains ran on weekends to Port O'Connor, and an estimated 10,000 tourists came every summer. Port O'Connor has been struck by four hurricanes since it was initially settled. The 1919 Florida Keys hurricane brought the \\"good old days\\" to a halt, destroying the town. It rebuilt slowly, but the 1942 and 1945 hurricanes so close in time were hard to overcome.

Written by D. C. Fontana and directed by John Meredyth Lucas, it was first broadcast September 27, 1968. In the episode, the crew of the Enterprise are on a secret mission to steal a Romulan cloaking device. A sub-plot is a romance of sorts between Spock and a Romulan commander. Plot Captain Kirk orders the Federation starship USS Enterprise into Romulan space without any authorization from Starfleet of which the bridge crew are aware. Romulan vessels intercept the Enterprise and Kirk negotiates an hour's time to consider surrendering his ship. Kirk, along with the Vulcan First Officer Spock are then invited aboard the Romulan flagship. Once aboard the Romulan ship, Kirk and Spock are taken before a female commander who demands an explanation for their intrusion into Romulan space. Kirk claims that instrument failure caused the ship to stray off course, but Spock divulges that the captain ordered entry into Romulan space, and asserts that he is insane. Romulan guards lead Kirk to their brig. Alone with Spock in her quarters, the commander questions Spock about his career. She argues that humans may have shown their disregard for his talents and capabilities by not giving him command of a ship, but the Romulans, if he were willing, would not make that mistake. In the Romulan brig, Kirk injures himself by lunging against the force field door. Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy is summoned from the Enterprise to attend to him. The commander asks McCoy to confirm Spock's characterization of the captain as mentally incompetent and McCoy does so, whereupon the commander calls on Spock to assume command of the Enterprise. Kirk, calling Spock a traitor, attacks him, and Spock defends himself using what he calls the \\"Vulcan death grip\\". Kirk slumps to the floor, and McCoy declares him dead. Back on the Enterprise, Kirk awakens from the state of suspension brought on by the so-called death grip. His apparent insanity, the unauthorized venture into Romulan space, and Spock's betrayal have all been part of a secret Federation plan to steal the Romulan cloaking device. Kirk orders McCoy to perform plastic surgery to give him Romulan features and then transports back to the Romulan vessel disguised as one of their officers. Meanwhile, Spock and the commander dine in her quarters, and their conversation grows intimate. When the commander goes to change her attire, Spock directs Kirk, via communicator, to the location of the cloaking device. His signal is discovered and tracked, and Spock surrenders himself to the Romulan officers, but they are too late to prevent Kirk from stealing the cloaking device and returning with it to the Enterprise. Chief Engineer Scott attempts to adapt the Romulan cloaking device to the Enterprise while Ensign Chekov succeeds in distinguishing Spock's life signs from those of the Romulans. Both Spock and the Romulan commander are beamed to the Enterprise where Kirk gives the order to return to Federation space. The pursuing Romulans are ready to fire upon them as Scott successfully activates the cloak and the Enterprise vanishes before their eyes. The now- captured Romulan commander chides Spock that any advantage the Federation gains from studying the new cloaking device model will be temporary, as before too long the Romulans will simply build an even better model. Spock admits that military secrets are perhaps the most fleeting of all. She asks if what passed between them was all just a ruse, but Spock admits that he actually was tempted - though his sense of duty to Starfleet is even stronger. Production =Writing= D. C. Fontana based this story very loosely upon the Pueblo incident, in which a United States Navy ship and its crew were seized, and the crew held on charges of espionage for almost a year, after the ship allegedly strayed into North Korean waters.Sarantakes, Nicholas Evan: Cold War Pop Culture and the Image of U.S. Foreign Policy: The Perspective of the Original Star Trek Series, in: Journal of Cold War Studies, Volume 7, Number 4, Fall 2005, pp. 97-99 (74-103). The first draft of the script had Spock \\"raining kisses on every square inch above the shoulder\\" of the Romulan commander but this was changed, at Leonard Nimoy's insistence, to the more demure finger caresses. Fontana has pointed out that the \\"raining kisses\\" scene was actually an embellishment by Gene Roddenberry‚Äîone of the few he applied to third season scripts‚Äîand that the original script submitted had only an embrace and kiss, with most of the passion being delivered by the Romulan commander. Originally, both Kirk and McCoy were disguised as Romulans and went aboard the Romulan ship to steal the cloaking device. This was dropped not only due to cost concerns, but because Robert H. Justman pointed out that having McCoy doing plastic surgery on his own ears would have stretched believability, and including a character to perform the surgery on both Kirk and McCoy would have required casting an additional role, further increasing the cost. =Models= Two of the three Romulan warships are actually Klingon craft, used in addition to the Romulan bird-of-prey seen in the episode \\"Balance of Terror\\". Although in production order the model was first used (as a Klingon ship) in \\"Elaan of Troyius\\", in broadcast order it is first seen in this episode. Spock says at the start of the episode that \\"intelligence reports Romulans now using Klingon design.\\" Non-canon media * The name of the Romulan commander and her fate are not revealed in the episode. At least two different explanations are given in Trek novels‚ÄîThe Price of the Phoenix and Vulcan's Heart. (In the early days of Trek writing, many novels contradicted each other, so the commander has had a number of names and fates.) The latest explanation is given in the novel Vulcan's Heart, by Josepha Sherman and Susan Shwartz, which gives her name as Liviana Charvanek. Apparently, sometime after the events of this episode, Charvanek was returned to Romulus and resumed her military career. * D. C. Fontana co- wrote a sequel: Star Trek: Year Four‚ÄîThe Enterprise Experiment, a graphic novel published by IDW Publishing in 2008. * This episode is referenced in the video game Star Trek: Tactical Assault. During a Federation mission the player's ship is equipped with the Romulan cloaking device stolen by Kirk and ordered to launch a sneak attack on a Klingon starbase. * The Romulan commander and Subcommander Tal are central characters in the two-part series conclusion to Star Trek Continues. The part of the Romulan commander was played by Amy Rydell, daughter of Joanne Linville, who played the role in the original episode. Reception In 2014, Gizmodo ranked \\"The Enterprise Incident\\" as the 48th best episode of Star Trek, out of the over 700 made by that time (including the spin-off series). In 2016, The Hollywood Reporter rated \\"The Enterprise Incident\\" the 33rd best television episode of all Star Trek franchise television prior to Star Trek: Discovery, including live-action and the animated series but not counting the movies. They note that this episode is the favorite of the director of the 2016 film Star Trek:Beyond, Justin Lin. In 2016, Newsweek ranked \\"The Enterprise Incident\\" as one of the best episodes of the original series. They note Spock's interaction with the Romulan commander, and the Federation's desire for a science fiction technology, Star Treks \\"cloaking device\\". In 2017, Comic Book Resources ranked Spock and the Romulan commander the 11th best romantic relationship of the Star Trek franchise up to that time. In 2017, CBR ranked the Romulan commander the 7th \\"fiercest\\" female character of the Star Trek universe. In 2020, SyFy recommended watching this episode for background on Romulan aliens for Star Trek: Picard.

Advanced for its time, it was the fastest carrier-based aircraft put into service by Japan during the war. The Allied reporting name was Myrt. Development and design The C6N originated from a 1942 Imperial Japanese Navy specification for a carrier-based reconnaissance plane with a top speed of 350 knots (650 km/h) at 6,000 m and range of 2,500 nautical miles (4,960 km).Francillon 1970, p. 434. Nakajima's initial proposal, designated N-50, was for a craft with two 1,000 hp engines housed in tandem in the fuselage, driving two propellers mounted on the wings. With the development of the 2,000 hp class Nakajima Homare engine, the dual powerplant configuration was abandoned and Nakajima decided on a more conventional single-engine layout. Unfortunately the new Homare's power output was less than expected, and the design had to be optimized in other areas. The resulting aircraft was designed around a long and extremely narrow cylindrical fuselage just large enough in diameter to accommodate the engine. The crew of three sat in tandem under a single canopy, while equipment was similarly arranged in a line along the fuselage. The C6N's low-mounted laminar flow wing housed fuel tanks and was fitted with both Fowler and slit flaps and leading-edge slats which lowered the aircraft's landing speed to ease use aboard aircraft carriers.Francillon 1970, p. 435. Like Nakajima's earlier B6N Tenzan torpedo bomber, the vertical stabilizer was angled slightly forward to enable tighter packing on aircraft carrier decks. The C6N's first flight was on 15 May 1943, with the prototype demonstrating a speed of 639 km/h (345 kt, 397 mph).Francillon 1970, p. 436. Performance of the Homare engine was disappointing, especially its power at altitude, and a series of 18 further prototypes and pre-production aircraft were built before the Saiun was finally ordered into production in February 1944.Mondey 1996, p. 218. Operational history Although designed for carrier use, by the time it entered service in September 1944 there were few carriers left for it to operate from, so most C6Ns were flown from land bases. Its speed was exemplified by a telegraph sent after a successful mission: \\"No Grummans can catch us.\\" (\\"Êàë„Å´ËøΩ„ÅÑ„Å§„Åè„Ç∞„É©„Éû„É≥„Å™„Åó\\"). The top speed of the Hellcat was indeed of the same level, so overtaking a Saiun was out of the question.Francillon 1979, p. 40. A total of 463 aircraft were produced. A single prototype of a turbocharged development mounting a 4-blade propeller was built; this was called the C6N2 Saiun-kai. Several examples of a night fighter version C6N1-S with oblique-firing (Schr√§ge Musik configuration) single 30 mm (or dual 20 mm) cannon were converted from existing C6N1s. As Allied bombers came within reach of the Japanese home islands, a first class night fighter was required. This led Nakajima to develop the C6N1-S by removing the observer and replacing him with two 20 mm cannons. The C6N1-S's effectiveness was hampered by the lack of air-to-air radar, although it was fast enough to enjoy almost complete immunity from interception by Allied fighters. A torpedo carrying C6N1-B was also proposed, but was not needed after most of Japan's aircraft carriers were destroyed. Despite its speed and performance, on 15 August 1945 a C6N1 happened to be the last aircraft to be shot down in World War II. Just five minutes later, the war was over and all Japanese aircraft were grounded. Variants Nakajima C6N1-S night fighter variant. Note the obliquely mounted 30 mm cannon in the fuselage.

The situation was the following: many merchants were importing coffee from other countries, of poor quality and freshness, and passing them off as locally produced. When tourists and local consumers tasted the coffee, they complained about how bad it was, and as a result sales declined drastically and the coffee industry suffered greatly.Company History In 1928, hurricane San Felipe destroyed most of the coffee plantations on the island, and the Great Depression also affected the economy. Col√≥n becomes general manager In 1932, Col√≥n was named general manager of the cooperative and undertook the reorganization of the company during its time of crisis. The cooperative was almost bankrupt, and the first thing Col√≥n did was to obtain a loan from the Department of Agriculture and Commerce. With the money, he bought new equipment to replace the old and outdated equipment in the company. Col√≥n was able to convince the Puerto Rican legislature to pass a law against the then- rampant adulteration and contraband of coffee. \\"Cafe Rico\\" Col√≥n was credited with convincing the government to impose import tariffs on coffee, thereby ensuring the island would not be invaded by cheap coffee of poor quality, which often was advertised as locally produced. The cooperative purchased and installed a new torrefaction plant in which the local coffee was processed. Colon set out to gain access to the United States coffee market, helped the local coffee growers obtain lines of credit from local bankers, and got financial help from the federal and local government for the export of the cooperative's coffee. This coffee was named \\"Cafe Rico\\" and was well received locally and internationally, soon reestablishing the good fame of Puerto Rico's coffee worldwide. The cooperative became the first coffee manufacturer to sell its coffee in sealed cans. The quality of Cafe Rico has received numerous medals and recognition in contests celebrated all over the world. Col√≥n established the only coffee tasting laboratory in Puerto Rico. One of Cafe Rico's byproducts, \\"San Carlos Selection\\", is the official coffee of Vatican City.Coffee Growers Try to Revive a Toast of Cafe Society. Abby Goodnough. The New York Times.

Accessed 25 December 2018. Cooperative expansion Under Colon's leadership, the cooperative was able to expand and diversify. The company sells food and agricultural equipment with sales of over $5 million. It also owns and operates an egg processing company which calls its product \\"Huevos Rico\\" (Rico Eggs). The cooperative owns an insurance company, its own credit corporation that grants loans to farmers, and its own printing plant that prints and distributes an agricultural magazine worldwide. Recently, the cooperative has started to operate gasoline stations in San Juan, Mayaguez and Ponce. When Col√≥n took over the company in 1932 as a general manager the cooperative had only $284,000 in annual sales. By 1963 the cooperative had over $35,000,000 in sales. The cooperative has offices and warehouses in Ponce (main offices), San Juan, Mayag√ºez, Arecibo, Yauco, San Sebastian, Utuado, Adjuntas, Jayuya and Ciales. Legacy Col√≥n served as a senator, representing the district of Ponce in the Puerto Rican Senate and was named Administrator of the cooperative, a position he held until his retirement in 1965. In 1952 the Constitution of Puerto Rico was adopted, creating the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and Col√≥n was a member of the Constitutional Convention of Puerto Rico. He was a delegate to Republican National Convention from Puerto Rico in the years 1948, 1952 and 1956.Political Graveyard Ramiro L.
