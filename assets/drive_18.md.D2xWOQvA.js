His birth and death dates are unclear, sometimes recorded as 1804-1855 or as 1801‚Äì1872. His botanical collections are present in many European herbaria. He sold animal fossils to the British Museum and the Jardin des Plantes in France. He later had an article about the geology of Minas Gerais published through the L'Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique. He worked with Jules Paul Benjamin Delessert.Urban, I. (1906) Flora Brasiliensis, 1(1): 12-13Warming, E. (1880/1881) Botanisk Tidsskrift, 12: 125-126. Life On account of fraud he emigrated to Brazil, and with Don Pedro I's army arrived in Rio de Janeiro. He at first enlisted as a common soldier and later lived as a peddler. During Argentine's Cisplatine War with Brazil between 1825‚Äì1828, he served as a spy. Later he lived as a merchant in the province of Cachoeira do Campo, in the State of Minas Gerais, becoming the owner of a farm in the northerly neighborhood of Curvelo, some days' journey north of Lagoa Santa. On his great journey through the Brazilian countryside in 1833‚Äì35, he chanced to meet the Danish naturalist Peter Wilhelm Lund accompanied by the German botanist Ludwig Riedel in October 1834. There he used the name \\"Pedro Claudio Dinamarquez\\", and stayed on Lund's farm 'Porteirinho' for about a week. This meeting proved a turning point in both Lund's and Clausen's lives. On the farm were caves in the limestone hills, and these were exploited by the local people for fertilizer. Visits to these caves by Lund uncovered numerous fossil remains. The study of these linked Lund forever to inland Brazil. For commercial reasons Clausen's acquaintance with Lund turned him into a natural history collector, both of plants and fossil animals. In 1843 he accompanied Francis de Castelnau on his South American expedition. After returning to Europe he began to suffer from mental problems and so was taken to a hospital in Dartford, London, where he died in 1855.

It is located about from Cordisburgo and northwest of Belo Horizonte, in the State of Minas Gerais. The cave has seven huge chambers explored, amounting to (linear) and unevenness of the ground of only . Safety measures like lighting, walkways and handrails allow a multitude of visitors to enjoy safely the wonders of the grotto where the whole journey is accompanied by an experienced local guide. Description Geography Maquin√© finds itself facing north, with a portico shaped in the form of a shallow arch with width of approximately and height of only . The main direction of the cave is from north to south, being its greatest extent of . With an internal temperature ranging from , it is essentially horizontal, forming a continuous gallery with an average width of and height of . The main element of its formation is calcium carbonate, presenting also other minerals such as silica, gypsum, quartz and iron. Its galleries and halls, true architectural oddities, are the result of the formidable job of water in the persistence of millennia. Morphology The grotto features beautiful morphology due to its wide halls and aesthetic value due to their speleothematic beauty, in addition to its scientific value as it must have accommodated a considerable volume of water in the past. * First chamber, called \\"Vestibulo\\" (\\"Entrance Hall\\"), is fully illuminated by the natural light coming from the entrance of the cave. It measures in length, in width and contains numerous stalagmites that rise from the ground. The most distant of them are heaped in a single group that rises up to the upper dome, forming a back wall where two large blocks of quartz detach from the huge layer of the same mineral. * Second Chamber, called \\"Sala das Colunas\\" (\\"Room of Columns\\"), is long by width. Masses of stalagmites that rise up to the dome link this wall to that which separates the preceding chamber. Other masses have risen as the first, leaving only a descent. The layer of stalagmites here formed was punctured so that the nitrogenous component contained therein might be extracted. This layer contains a large quantity of small bones and teeth. * Third chamber, called \\"Altar\\" or \\"Trono\\" (\\"Altar\\", or \\"Throne\\"), is long, wide and high. A group of stalagmites which separates this chamber from the preceding one form a bouquet on both sides, creating a niche arranged like an amphitheater in whose entry, a high figure resembling a bear on a pedestal is displayed. * Fourth chamber, called \\"Carneiro\\" (\\"Lamb\\"), measures long, wide and high. It distinguishes itself from all the other chambers mostly because the ground is covered with gypsum powder. Noticeable also in this room, besides the figure of a lamb, is the imposing figure of a gigantic mushroom. * Fifth chamber, called \\"Sal√£o das Piscinas\\" (\\"Hall of Pools\\"), measuring in length and width and in height, forms the deepest part of the cave. In the center of this cavern is a large basin about deep whose walls are covered with delicate crystals of fluorspar limestone. Large masses of stalagmites resembling ancient statues in a Roman bath adorn the opposite edges of the basin. * Sixth chamber, called \\"Sal√£o das Fadas\\" (\\"Hall of the Fairies\\"), is long and high. In this room bones of large animals, including the remains of a mammoth have been found. In the background of this chamber there is a passage to another room and a limpid cascade which has condensed itself into bright alabaster. The whole chamber and all the figures existing in it are decorated with a delicate crust of crystals of calcium carbonate, sometimes of the purest white, sometimes differently colored. The splendid reflections produced by the light illuminating the many facets of this crystal, dazzle the eye of those who gaze at this imagery and with it, see themselves transported to a fairy-like palace. Dr. Lund said: \\"My eyes have never seen anything more beautiful and magnificent in the domains of nature and art.\\" * Seventh chamber is divided into two parts. The first one is referred to as \\"Sal√£o do Dr. Lund\\" (\\"Dr. Lund's Hall\\"), and is considered the most important of the chambers by the amount of bones that it contains. It is 42 meters long, 22 meters wide and 15 meters high. It leads downwards and forms many watersheds along the way. In the middle of the chamber there is a 60-centimeter-wide by 4.5-meter-deep coverage through which all excess of water is drained out of the cave. The second chamber is called \\"Sal√£o do Cemit√©rio\\" (\\"Cemetery Hall\\"), which is the largest of the chambers in the cave measuring 162.5 meters long by 56 meters wide. It is coated with a crumbly layer of plaster powder stalagmites which covers the ground, piling up to the ceiling. Paleontology Considered as the \\"cradle\\" of paleontology in the country, the grotto was discovered in 1825 by farmer Joaquim Maria Maquin√©, then the landowner. It is widely known for its paleontological importance detected initially by Peter Claussen and the Danish naturalist Peter Wilhelm Lund who scientifically first explored it in 1834. Dr. Lund remained inside the cave nearly two years doing his research on the Brazilian paleontology, describing all the chambers, explaining the formation of stalagmites and stalactites and examining human remains and petrifaction of animals from the Quaternary period. Among others, he found fossilized skeletons of birds with an extraordinary curvature of up to three meters and the Nothrotherium maquinense, the smallest and most emblematic of the terrestrial sloths which he found in 1835 when he first explored the cave. In 1868, after more than 30 years after the exploration of the cave, Lund wished to return to Cordisburgo and show the Duke of Saxe who visited the country, the natural beauty of this huge cave.

The Cherokees were involved because ongoing encroachment of their territory in the area had led them to take up arms. These activities prompted settlers to seek refuge at Lindley's Fort in present-day Laurens County. A joint force of Cherokee and Loyalists adorned with Indian warpaint descended on the fort one day after about 150 militiamen arrived at the stockade fort. The defenders repulsed the attackers, and when they withdrew, made a sortie and pursued them. Two Loyalists were killed and 13 taken prisoner. Background The American Revolutionary War in the southern of the Thirteen Colonies did not at first involve Native Americans directly. Conflicts between Loyalist and Patriot colonists in the backcountry of South Carolina in late 1775 had resulted in the arrest, flight, or expulsion of most of the prominent Loyalist leaders. A number of Loyalists fled to the nearby Cherokee towns (located in and around present-day western South Carolina in the southern Appalachian Mountains), where they were given refuge. By early 1776, a delegation of northern Indians had arrived in the Cherokee villages, and convinced the younger generation of warriors to \\"take up the hatchet\\" against the colonists. Although the British Indian agent John Stuart tried to keep the Cherokee neutral, he realized that war was inevitable, and sought to channel Cherokee military activities to coordinate with British efforts. Battle The Cherokee went on the warpath on July 1, 1776. Henry Laurens wrote that the Cherokee attacked \\"very suddenly, without any pretense to Provocation those treacherous Devils in various Parties headed by White Men\\", killing as many as 60 South Carolinians. The timing of this campaign was fortuitous for the Cherokee: a major British force had been anchored off Charleston, South Carolina since early June, but its attack on the city had been repulsed in the June 28 Battle of Sullivan's Island. As a result, Continental Army general Charles Lee was unable to provide any sort of relief. When the Cherokee attacks began in South Carolina, refugees began fleeing the outlying settlements for frontier fortifications. One of these was Lindley's Fort, a vestige of the Anglo-Cherokee War of the early 1760s that was rehabilitated and strengthened by the refugees. A militia company under Major Jonathan Downs arrived at the fort on July 14, raising the total number of armed defenders to about 150. The next day a force of about 190 Loyalists and Cherokee arrived. Although they attempted an assault on the fort, its stockade walls were sufficient to withstand their weaponry, which was limited to muskets and Indian weapons such as tomahawks. When the attackers began to abandon the attempt on the fort in favor of easier raiding targets nearby, Major Downs led a sortie from the fort. In a running battle he managed to capture about 10 Loyalists. Aftermath The Cherokee raids in the spring and summer of 1776 sparked a major backlash. The Carolinas, Georgia, and Virginia all devoted significant militia resources to campaign against the Cherokee. Between late July and early October 1776, militia forces numbering in the thousands entered Cherokee land, destroying crops and villages. The Cherokee themselves fled before the advance, and ended up taking refuge in lands further west and south. The site of Lindley's Fort outside Laurens, South Carolina is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

North of North with voilinist Erkki Veltheim and pianist Anthony Pateras. This ensemble tours Europe regularly and has released two albums drawing from Xenakian architextures, Carterian set theory, Carnatic music, sharp-edged pointillism and orchestrational symbiosis in chamber-oriented improvisations. He is a founding member and previous Associate Artistic Director of the Australian Art Orchestra Tinkler has done a range of projects with the composer and violinist John Rodgers, working in ensembles such as Ellision, Hydromus Krysogast and the Antripodean Collective. Notably, Rodgers composed Glass, a concerto featuring Tinkler as soloist performed with the London Sinfonietta, which premiered at the 2010 Adelaide Festival of Arts. He plays regularly in Australia in duos, trios and quartets with musicians including Marc Hannaford, Simon Barker, Paul Grabowsky, Erkki Veltheim, Ken Eadie and Carl Dewhurst. Tinkler is also involved in an ongoing solo project that uses extended and prepared techniques; his first solo trumpet album called Backwards was released by Extreme in 2007.  1990s  In the early 1990s, Tinkler performed and studied with Australian tenor saxophonist, Mark Simmonds, who had studied with George Coleman in New York. Simmonds introduced Tinkler to extended practice on the cycle of 5ths using many harmonic substitutions involving the diminished substitution theory, rhythm cycles and polyrhythms as a basis for his highly fuelled jazz-based music, which can be traced to earlier developments by John Coltrane. Throughout Tinkler's career he has been interested in not only exploring and developing improvised music stemming from jazz, but also other forms of music and the cultures they come from. This has led to musical collaborations with Indian and Korean musicians, as well as with indigenous musicians from Australia. Beginning in 1995, Tinkler's involvement with Indian Carnatic musicians (led by Guru Kaaraikkudi) has evolved into a longstanding and deep association. Tinkler has travelled to India five times for performances, as well as touring Australia and Europe with the project.  2000s  Tinkler has collaborated with a range of international artists over the past decade including Jason Moran, Tim Berne, Mark Helias, Anthony Burr, Tony Buck, Oscar Noriaga and Han Bennink. In 2003 Tinkler travelled with his longtime associate Paul Grabowsky to New York to record an album of Grabowsky's original music with Branford Marsalis, Joe Lovano, Ed Schuller and Jeff \\"Tain\\" Watts. Tales of Time and Space was released on the Warner label to stunning reviews, many highlighting Tinkler's unique contribution to Grabowsky's music. In 2006 Tinkler attended the Garma Festival, which celebrates the cultural inheritance of the Yolngu People, the indigenous Australians of Northeast Arnhem Land. The festival is held at Gulkula, near Yirrkala in the Australian outback. At this festival Tinkler collaborated with musicians from the Wagalik group, performing and workshopping.

In AD 190, Pantaenus from Alexandria visited these Christians.Church History by Eusebius. Book V Chapter X. He found that they were using the Gospel of Matthew in the Hebrew language. Around AD 522, an Egyptian monk, Cosmas Indicopleustes, visited the Malabar Coast.

Though the Saint Thomas Christians welcomed them, these bishops had not made any effort to subjugate them. Saint Thomas Christians remained as an independent group, their bishops coming from the Church of the East until the 16th century. Saint Thomas Christians were greatly affected by the arrival of the Portuguese in India in 1498.

Nasrani people Nasranis or Syriac Christians of Kerala in ancient days (from an old painting).

As a community with common cultural heritage and cultural tradition, they refer to themselves as Nasranis. However, as a religious group, they refer to themselves as Mar Thoma Khristianis or in English as Saint Thomas Christians, based on their religious tradition of Syriac Christianity.Leslie Brown, (1956) The Indian Christians of St. Thomas. An Account of the Ancient Syrian Church of Malabar, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1956, 1982 (repr.)Origin of Christianity in India - A Historiographical Critique by Dr. Benedict Vadakkekara.

However, from a religious angle, the Saint Thomas Christians of today belong to various denominations as a result of a series of developments including Portuguese persecutionClaudius Buchanan, 1811., Menachery G; 1973, 1998; Mundalan, A. M; 1984; Podipara, Placid J. 1970; Leslie Brown, 1956 (a landmark split leading to a public Oath known as Coonen Cross Oath), reformative activities during the time of the British (6,000 - 12,000 Jacobites joined the C.M.S. in 1836, after the Synod of Mavelikara; who are now within the Church of South India), doctrines and missionary zeal influence ( Malankara Church and Patriarch/Catholicos issue (division of Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and Malankara Jacobite Syriac Orthodox Church (1912)). St. Thomas Christian families who claim their descent from ancestors who were baptized by Apostle Thomas are found all over Kerala.N.M.Mathew. St. Thomas Christians of Malabar Through Ages. CSS Tiruvalla.

After the 8th century when Hindu Kingdoms came to sway, Christians were expected to strictly abide by stringent rules pertaining to caste and religion. This became a matter of survival. This is why St. Thomas Christians had such a strong sense of caste and tradition, being the oldest order of Christianity in India. The Archdeacon was the head of the Church, and Palliyogams (Parish Councils) were in charge of temporal affairs. They had a liturgy-centered life with days of fasting and abstinence. Their devotion to the Mar Thoma tradition was absolute. Their churches were modelled after Jewish synagogues. \\"The church is neat and they keep it sweetly. There are mats but no seats. Instead of images, they have some useful writing from the holy book.\\"Herberts, Some Years Travels into Asia and Afrique. 1636. Page 304. See also N.M. Mathew, St, Thomas Christians of Malabar Through Ages, 2003. p. 91. In short, the St. Thomas Christians of Kerala have blended well with the ecclesiastical world of the Eastern Churches and with the changing socio- cultural environment of their homeland. Thus, the Malabar Church was Hindu or Indian in culture, Christian in religion, and Judeo-Syriac-Oriental in terms of origin and worship. Apostolic origin According to the 1st century annals of Pliny the Elder and the author of Periplus of the Erythraean sea, Muziris in Kerala could be reached in 40 days' time from the Egyptian coast purely depending on the South West Monsoon winds.Sarayu Doshi. ‚Äò‚ÄôIndia and Egypt‚Äô‚Äô. Bombay. 1993. p. 45. The Sangam works Puranaooru and Akananooru have many lines which speak of the Roman vessels and the Roman gold that used to come to the Kerala ports of the great Chera kings in search of pepper and other spices, which had enormous demand in the West.Miller, J. Innes; (1960), Periplus Maris Erythraei The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea The lure of spices attracted traders from the Middle East and Europe to the many trading ports of Keralaputera (Kerala) ‚Äî Tyndis, (Ponnani), Muziris, near Kodungallur, Niranam, Bacare, Belitha, and Comari (Kanyakumari) long before the time of Christ.N.M.Mathew. ‚Äò‚ÄôSt. Thomas Christians of Malabar Through Ages‚Äô‚Äô.

By Kenneth Scott Latourette, page 80 Jews were living in Kerala from the time of Solomon.P.M. Jussay, The Jews of Kerala, University of Calicut, 2005. Later, large numbers of them arrived in 586 BC and 72 AD. The drawings and its captions on the wall of the only remaining Jewish Synagogue in Kerala, at Mattancherry, Kochi near Ernakulam endorse these facts. Its traditionally believed that during his stay in Kerala, the Apostle baptized the Jews and some of the wise men who adored the Infant Jesus.Bowler, Gerry. (2000). ‚Äò‚ÄôThe World Encyclopedia of Christmas‚Äô‚Äô. Page 139. The Apostle established seven \\"and a half\\" churches in Malabar at Kodungalloor (Muziris), Paravur, Palayoor, Kokkamangalam, Niranam, Nilackal, Kollam, and the Thiruvithamcode Arappally in Kanyakumari district. The Apostle also preached in other parts of India. The visit of the Apostle Thomas to these places and to Mylapore on the East coast of India can be read in the Ramban Songs of Thomas Ramban, set into 'moc', 1500.Menachery G; 1973, 1982, 1998; Leslie Brown, 1956 He was martyred in 72 at Little Mount, a little distant from St. Thomas Mount, and was buried at San Thome, near the modern city of Chennai. The body of Apostle Thomas was translated to Edessa, Iraq. It is now in Ortona, Italy. Relics of Apostle Thomas were translated to the San Thome Cathedral in Chennai and to St Thomas Church in Palayur, near Guruvayoor at Chavakkad Taluk, Thrissur District in Kerala.Eastern Christianity in India: A History of the Syro-Malabar Church - Eug√®ne Tisserant Several ancient writers mention India as the scene of St. Thomas‚Äô labours. Ephrem the Syrian (300‚Äì378) writes in the forty-second of his \\"Carmina Nisibina\\" that the Apostle was put to death in India, and that his remains were subsequently buried in Edessa, brought there by a merchant.MEDLYCOTT, India and the Apostle St. Thomas (London, 1905). St. Ephraem in a hymn about the relics of St. Thomas at Edessa depicts Satan exclaiming, \\"The Apostle whom I killed in India comes to meet me in Edessa.\\" Gregory Nazianzen, (329‚Äì389), in a homily says; \\"What! were not the Apostles foreigners? Granting that Judea was the country of Peter, what had Saul to do with the Gentiles, Luke with Achaia, Andrew with Epirus, Thomas with India, Mark with Italy?.\\" Ambrose (340‚Äì397) writes \\"When the Lord Jesus said to the Apostles, go and teach all nations, even the kingdoms that had been shut off by the barbaric mountains lay open to them as India to Thomas, as Persia to Mathew.\\" There are other passages in ancient liturgies and martyrologies which refer to the work of St. Thomas in India. These passages indicate that the tradition that St. Thomas died in India was widespread among the early churches.Menachery G; 1973, 1982, 1998; Mackenzie G.T 1905 ; Aiya Nagam 1905 ; Medlycott Dr. 1905 ; Many writers have mentioned that the Apostle established seven \\"and a half\\" churches in Malabar.Orientale Conquistado (2 vols., Indian reprint, Examiner Press, BombayThe Encyclopedia of Christianity By FAHLBUSCH, Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley page 285 They are:[Menachery G; 1973, 1998; Mundalan, A.

[Other claimants for half church status are Malayattoor and Athirappalli]. Six of the churches are preserved even now (see pictures). The church at Kollam is believed to have been submerged in the ocean, possibly following tidal waves, while the actual location of the church at Chayal has not been identified conclusively. The church at Palayoor is also, identified wrongly, as some historians conclude, that the original town Palayoor is present day Arthat. *64 Formation of the Metropolitanate of India. *72 Apostle Thomas attained martyrdom at St. Thomas Mount in Chennai and is buried on the site of San Thome Cathedral. =2nd century= *190 Pantaenus, the founder of the famous Catechetical School of Alexandria, visited India and the Nasranis.

Early history the Emperor Constantine (centre) and the bishops of the First Council of Nicaea (325) holding the Niceno‚ÄìConstantinopolitan Creed of 381. Doctrine of the Apostles states that, \\"India and all its countries . . . received the Apostle‚Äôs hand of priesthood from Judas Thomas‚Ä¶.\\" From an early period the Church of St. Thomas Christians came into a lifelong relationship with the Church of the East, which was also established by Thomas the apostle according to early Christian writings. The Primate or Metropolitan of Persia consecrated bishops for the Indian Church, which brought it indirectly under the control of Seleucia.NSC Network (2007). \\"Defining a Kerala Syrian Christian\\". Placid (1950), Mundanadan (1970), S G Pothen (1970). The Church of the East traces its origins to the See of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, said to be founded by Thomas the Apostle. Other founding figures are Saint Mari and Saint Addai as evidenced in the Doctrine of Addai and the Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari. This is the original Christian church in what was once Parthia: eastern Iraq and Iran. The See of Seleucia-Ctesiphon developing within the Persian Empire, at the east of the Christian world, rapidly took a different course from other Eastern Christians. The First Council of Nicaea, held in Nicaea in Bithynia (present- day ƒ∞znik in Turkey), convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in 325, was the first Ecumenical council of the Christian Church, and most significantly resulted in the first uniform Christian doctrine, called the Nicene Creed. It is documented that Mar John, the Bishop of Great India attended the council. The prelate signs himself as \\"John the Persian presiding over the Churches in the whole of Persia and Great India.\\" Some centuries following, the Persian Church suffered severe persecutions. The persecuted Christians and even bishops, at least on two occasions, sought an asylum in Malabar. The Rock crosses of Kerala found at St.Thomas Mount and throughout Malabar coast has inscriptions in Pahlavi and Syriac. It is dated from before the 8th Century. In 825, the arrival of two bishops are documented, Mar Sapor and Mar Prodh. Le Quien says that \\"these bishops were Chaldaeans and had come to Quilon soon after its foundation. They were men illustrious for their sanctity, and their memory was held sacred in the Malabar Church. They constructed many churches and, during their lifetime, the Christian religion flourished especially in the kingdom of Diamper.\\" The beginning of Kolla Varsham resulted in the origin of Christianity in Kerala as an individual religion outside vedic Vaishnavism The Church after Thomas In 190, Pantaenus, probably the founder of the famous Catechetical School of Alexandria, visited India and the Nasranis.Eusebius, (AD 260-341), Bishop of Caesarea.Church History in Book V, Chapter 10. The First Council of Nicaea, held in Nicaea in Bithynia (present- day ƒ∞znik in Turkey), convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in 325, was the first Ecumenical council of the Christian Church, and most significantly resulted in the first uniform Christian doctrine, called the Nicene Creed. Many historians have written that ‚Äò‚ÄôMar John, the Bishop of Great India‚Äô‚Äô attended the council. Church life bore characteristics of a church which had its origin and growth outside the Graeco-Roman world. There was no centralized administrative structure on a monarchical pattern. The territorial administrative system which developed after the diocesan pattern within the eastern and western Roman empires did not exist in the Indian Church. \\"They have the uncorrupted Testament Which they believe was translated for them by St. Thomas the apostle himself.\\"Herberts. Some years Travels Into Asia And Afrique. London, 1638. p. 300. Theophilus (ca 354) as recorded by church historian Philostorgius mentions about a church, priests, liturgy, in the immediate vicinity of the Maldives, which can only apply to a Christian church and faithful on the adjacent coast of India. The people referred to were the Christians known as a body who had their liturgy in the Syriac language and inhabited the west coast of India, i.e., Malabar. Shapur II the Great was the ninth King of the Sassanid Empire from 309 to 379. During that period, there was persecution against Christians. So in AD 345 under the leadership of Thomas of Cana 72 families landed at Muziris near Cranganore. They formed the group known as Knanaya Christians. They cooperated with the Malankara Church, attended worship services together but remained a separate identity They had regular visitors from their home land. Some of their priests and bishops visited them. But these visiting bishops had no authority over Saint Thomas Christians.Mathew, N.M. (History of the Marthoma Church. (Malayalam), Volume 1. Page 92-94and souvenirs published by Knanaya parishes in Kerala. The Church is mentioned by Cosmas Indicopleustes (about 535). He notes that, \\"There are Christians and believers in Taprobane (Sri Lanka), in Malabar where pepper grows there is a Christian church. At a place known as Kalyan, there is a bishop sent from Persia.‚Äù.Mathew, N.M. Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitram, (History of the Marthoma Church), Volume 1.(2006). Page 91.J.W. McCrindle, Christian Topography of Cosmos, an Egyption Monk (1897) Book 3, pp. 99-128. St. Gregory of Tours, before 590, reports that Theodore, a pilgrim who had gone to Gaul, told him that in that part of India where the corpus (bones) of St. Thomas had first rested, there stood a monastery and a church of striking dimensions and elaborately adorned, adding: \\"After a long interval of time these remains had been removed thence to the city of Edessa.\\" Early rituals and culture The life-style of the Saint Thomas Christians might be stated as \\"Indian in culture, Christian in faith and Oriental in worship\\". Social and culture Socially and culturally these Saint Thomas Christians remain as a part of the wider Indian community. They keep their Indian social customs, names and practices relating to birth, marriage, and death. They have Biblical names (Mar Thoma Christian names). At the same time they follow a number of Jewish customs like worship, baptism, wedding and other ceremonies which are entirely different from Western Churches. Collection of deeds The rulers of Kerala, always appreciated the contributions of St. Thomas Christians to the country and society. Thazhekad sasanam and deeds on copper plates bear witness to it. Five sheets of the three copper plates are now in the custody of St. Thomas Christians. #Thazhekad sasanam is one of the earliest surviving edicts granting special privileges to the St. Thomas Christians. The edict dating back to about 340-360 AD was written on stone and provides proof of the early existence of St. Thomas Christians in Kerala. #Iravi Corttan Deed: In the year 774 AD.

Visits from Rome to Malabar There are many accounts of visits from Rome, before the arrival of Portuguese. John of Monte Corvino, was a Franciscan missionary who traveled from Persia and moved down by sea to India, in 1291NSC Network (2007). \\"Defining a Kerala Syrian Christian\\". Odoric of Pordenone who arrived in India in 1321. He visited Malabar, landing at Pandarani (20 m. north of Calicut), at Cranganore, and at Kulam or Quilon.Odoric of Pordenone (Nendeen, Liechenstein, 1967), Henry Yule, trans. Cathy and the Way Thither vol. II. Father Jordanus, a Dominican, followed in 1321-22. He reported to Rome, apparently from somewhere on the west coast of India, that he had given Christian burial to four martyred monks. Jordanus, between 1324 and 1328 (if not earlier), probably visited Kulam and selected it as for his future work. He was appointed a bishop in 1328 and nominated by Pope John XXII in his bull Venerabili Fratri Jordano to the see of Columbum or Kulam (Quilon) on 21 August 1329. This diocese was the first in the whole of the Indies, with jurisdiction over modern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burma, and Sri Lanka.Sir Henry Yule's Jordanus, a version of the Mirabilia with a commentary (Hakluyt Society, 1863) and the same editor's Cathay, giving a version of the Epistles, with a commentary, &c.; (Hakluyt Society, 1866) pp. 184-185, 192-196, 225-230. In 1347, Giovanni de' Marignolli visited Malabar.J. G. Meinert, in Abhandl. der k. bohm. Gesellsch. der Wissenschaften, vol. vii. Another prominent Indian traveler was Joseph, priest over Cranganore. He journeyed to Babylon in 1490 and then sailed to Europe and visited Portugal, Rome, and Venice before returning to India. He helped to write a book about his travels titled The Travels of Joseph the Indian which was widely disseminated across Europe. Medieval period Prior to the Portuguese arrival in India in 1498, the Church of the East's See of Seleucia-Ctesiphon provided \\"Prelates\\" to the Saint Thomas Christians in India. This practise continued even after the arrival of the Portuguese till the Synod of Diamper (held in Udayamperoor) in 1599. There are many accounts of missionary activities before the arrival of Portuguese in and around Malabar. John of Monte Corvino was a Franciscan sent to China to become prelate of Peking about the year 1307. He traveled from Persia and moved down by sea to India in 1291, to the South India region or \\"Country of St. Thomas\\". There he preached for thirteen months and baptized about one hundred persons. From there Monte Corvino wrote home, in December 1291 (or 1292). That is one of the earliest noteworthy accounts of the Coromandel coast furnished by any Western European. Traveling by sea from Mailapur, he reached China in 1294, appearing in the capital \\"Cambaliech\\" (now Beijing)The Mongols and the West, Jackson, Peter (2005) Odoric of Pordenone arrived in India in 1321. He visited Malabar, touching at Pandarani (20 m. north of Calicut), at Cranganore, and at Kulam or Quilon, proceeding thence, apparently, to Ceylon and to the shrine of St. Thomas at Mailapur, South India. He writes he had found the place where Thomas was buried. Father Jordanus, a Dominican, followed in 1321‚Äì22. He reported to Rome, apparently from somewhere on the west coast of India, that he had given Christian burial to four martyred monks. Jordanus, between 1324 and 1328 (if not earlier), probably visited Kulam and selected it as the best centre for his future work; it would also appear that he revisited Europe about 1328, passing through Persia, and perhaps touching at the great Crimean port of Soidaia or Sudak. He was appointed a bishop in 1328 and nominated by Pope John XXII in his bull Venerabili Fratri Jordano to the see of Columbum or Kulam (Quilon) on 21 August 1329. This diocese was the first in the whole of the Indies, with jurisdiction over modern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burma, and Sri Lanka. Either before going out to Malabar as bishop, or during a later visit to the west, Jordanus probably wrote his Mirabilia, which from internal evidence can only be fixed within the period 1329‚Äì1338; in this work he furnished the best account of Indian regions, products, climate, manners, customs, fauna and flora given by any European in the Middle Ages ‚Äì superior even to Marco Polo's. In his triple division of the Indies, India Major comprises the coast from Malabar to Cochin China; while India Minor stretches from Sindh (or perhaps from Baluchistan) to Malabar; and India Tertia (evidently dominated by African conceptions in his mind) includes a vast undefined coast-region west of Baluchistan, reaching into the neighborhood of, but not including, Ethiopia and Prester John's domain. In 1347, Giovanni de' Marignolli visited the shrine of St Thomas in South India, and then proceeded to what he calls the kingdom of Saba, and identifies with the Sheba of Scripture, but which seems from various particulars to have been Java. Taking ship again for Malabar on his way to Europe, he encountered great storms. Another prominent Indian traveler was Joseph, priest over Cranganore. He journeyed to Babylon in 1490 and then sailed to Europe and visited Portugal, Rome, and Venice before returning to India. He helped to write a book about his travels titled The Travels of Joseph the Indian which was widely disseminated across Europe. When the Portuguese arrived on the Malabar Coast, the Christian communities that they found there had had longstanding traditional links with the See of Seleucia-Ctesiphonin Mesopotamia. During the subsequent period, in 1552, a split occurred within the Assyrian Church of the East forming the Chaldean Church, the latter entered into communion with Rome. After the split each church had its own patriarch; the Chaldean Church was headed by the Patriarch Mar Yohannan Sulaqa (1553‚Äì1555). Both claim to be the rightful heir to the East Syriac tradition. It is difficult to see the precise influence of this schism on the Church of Malabar as there was always overtones to Rome in earlier centuries. Apparently, both parties sent bishops to India. The last East Syriac Metropolitan before the schism, Mar Jacob (1504‚Äì1552), died in 1552. Catholicos Simeon VII Denkha sent a prelate to India, in the person of Mar Abraham, who was later to be the last Syrian Metropolitan of Malabar, after having gone over to the Chaldaean side. It is not known when he arrived in Malabar, but he must have been there already by 1556. Approximately at the same time, Chaldaean Patriarch Abdisho IV (1555‚Äì1567), the successor of Yohannan Sulaqa (murdered in 1555), sent the brother of John, Mar Joseph, to Malabar as a Chaldaean bishop; although consecrated in 1555 or 1556, Mar Joseph could not reach India before the end of 1556, nor Malabar before 1558. He was accompanied by another Chaldaean bishop, Mar Eliah. Colonialism and St Thomas Christians =Portuguese= The Portuguese erected a Latin diocese in Goa (1534) and another at Cochin (1558) in the hope of bringing the Thomas Christians under their jurisdiction. In a Goan Synod held in 1585 it was decided to introduce the Latin liturgy and practices among the Thomas Christians. Aleixo de Menezes, Archbishop of Goa from 1595 until his death in 1617 decided to bring the Kerala Christians to obedience after the death of Bishop Mar Abraham (the last Syrian Metropolitan of Malabar, laid to rest at St. Hormis church, Angamaly), an obedience that they conceived as complete conformity to the Roman or ‚ÄòLatin‚Äô customs. This meant separating the Nasranis not only from the Catholicosate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, but also from the Chaldaean Patriarchate of Babylon, and subjecting them directly to the Latin Archbishopric of Goa. The Portuguese refused to accept the legitimate authority of the Indian hierarchy and its relation with the East Syriac Christians, and in 1599 at the Synod of Diamper (held in Udayamperur), the Portuguese Archbishop of Goa imposed a large number of Latinizations. The Portuguese succeeded in appointing a Latin bishop to govern the Thomas Christians, and the local Christians‚Äô customs were officially anathematised as heretical and their manuscripts were condemned to be either corrected or burnt. The Portuguese padroado (‚Äôpatronage‚Äô) was extended over them. From 1599 up to 1896 these Christians were under the Latin Bishops who were appointed either by the Portuguese Padroado or by the Roman Congregation of Propaganda Fide. Every attempt to resist the latinization process was branded heretical by them. Under the indigenous leader, archdeacon, the Thomas Christians resisted, but the result was disastrous. The oppressive rule of the Portuguese padroado provoked a violent reaction on the part of the indigenous Christian community. The first solemn protest took place in 1653, known as the Koonan Kurishu Satyam (Coonan Cross Oath). Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thomas, a part of the Thomas Christians publicly took an oath in Matancherry, Cochin, that they would not obey the Portuguese bishops and the Jesuit missionaries. In the same year, in Alangad, Archdeacon Thomas was ordained, by the laying on of hands of twelve priests, as the first known indigenous Metropolitan of Kerala, under the name Mar Thoma I. After the Coonan Cross Oath, between 1661 and 1662, out of the 116 churches, the Catholics claimed eighty-four churches, and the Archdeacon Mar Thoma I with thirty-two churches. The eighty-four churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro Malabar Catholic Church have descended. The other thirty-two churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites and Orthodox), Thozhiyur (1772), Mar Thoma (Reformed Syrians) (1874), Syro Malankra Catholic Church have originated.Catholic Encyclopedia- \\"St. Thomas Christians\\" The Carmelite Period, Dr. Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India\\" In 1665, Mar Gregorios Abdul Jaleel, a Bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch arrived in India.Claudius Buchanan 1811 ., Menachery G; 1973, 1982, 1998; Podipara, Placid J. 1970; Leslie Brown, 1956; Tisserant, E. 1957; Michael Geddes, 1694;Dr. Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India\\" This visit resulted in the Mar Thoma faction claiming spiritual authority of the Antiochean Patriarchate and gradually introduced the West Syriac liturgy, customs and script to the Malabar Coast. The arrival of Mar Gregorios in 1665 marked the beginning of the association with the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch. Those who accepted the West Syriac theological and liturgical tradition of Mar Gregorios became known as Jacobites. Those who continued with East Syriac theological and liturgical tradition and stayed faithful to the Synod of Diamper are known as the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church in communion with the Catholic Church. They got their own Syro-Malabar Hierarchy on 21 December 1923 with the Metropolitan Mar Augustine Kandathil as the Head of their Church.Fr. George Thalian: , Mar Louis Memorial Press, 1961. (Postscript) (PDF). St. Thomas Christians by this process were divided into East Syriac and West Syriac branches. On 4 May 1493, Pope Alexander VI granted Portugal the right to develop and send missions east of a demarcation line. When India had been reached, Portugal assumed that India was theirs to develop. On 20 May 1498, Vasco de Gama landed at Kappad near Kozhikode (Calicut). In 1499, explorer Pedro √Ålvares Cabral landed at Kozhikode. In 1500, Joseph, a priest, told the Pope Alexander VI, in an audience, that Indian Christians accept the Patriarch of Babylon as their spiritual leader. On 26 November 1500, Franciscan Friars landed at Cochin. On 7 November 1502 de Gama lands at Cochin. When the Portuguese first discovered the Christians, they felt satisfied that their centuries-old dream of discovering eastern Christians had been fulfilled. They set great hopes on the St.Thomas Christians. These Christians too on their part experienced a spontaneous relief and joy at the arrival of powerful Christians from the West and desired the newcomers' help to strengthen their own privileges in India. So their arrival was enthusiastically welcomed by the local church. In fact, when Vasco da Gama arrived at Cochin on his second voyage (1502), a delegation of Thomas Christians went and met him and implored protection. In 1503, Dominican Priests, Catholic missionaries, were in Kochi. In 1503, Mar Yabella, Mar Denaha and Mar Yakoob from Persia went to Kerala. In 1503 the Portuguese commenced work on Cochin Fort and the Santa Cruz church. There were about thirty thousand St. Thomas families in Malabar in 1504.From a letter of five East Syriac bishops, written to their Patriarch in Babylon (in 1504) A letter written by East Syriac bishops announces the arrival of the Portuguese and the friendly relationship between them and the St. Thomas Christians. Cordial relations continued for two decades. However, Portuguese penetrating into the interior where they actually came face-to-face with St. Thomas Christians, realized that these Christians were neither subject to Rome, nor were they following Church traditions. To their dismay they found that these Christians were followers of the East Syriac Church, and its bishops looked after them, and the Patriarch in Babylonia was considered their ecclesiastical superior. Since the Pope had granted to the Portuguese crown sovereign rights over the eastern lands which come under their sway, the Portuguese thought, that is their right to bring the Thomas Christians under their control. To achieve this aim, the Portuguese worked among the local church for one and a half centuries. The Portuguese missionaries were ignorant of the Oriental traditions of the Indian Church. They were convinced that anything different from the Western Church was schismatic and heretical. Hence they wanted to Latinize the Syrian Christians of India. The visitors were appalled at the tolerance for other religions that was displayed by the locals. In 1514, the Portuguese Padroado began. In 1514 Jewish people migrated from Kodungalloor to Kochi. On 12 June 1514 the Portuguese colony at Funchal began their dominion over Christians in India. On 23 December 1524 de Gama was buried at St. Francis Church, Fort Cochin. In 1534 the Goa Catholic Diocese was erected. The parishes of Kannur, Cochin, Quilon, Colombo and Sao Tome (Madras) were part of it. In 1540 Franciscan Fr. Vincent De Lagos started the Cranganore Seminary to train native priests. On 6 May 1542 St. Francis Xavier, Apostolic Nuncio in the East, reached Goa. He was in Travancore between 1544 and 1545. In 1548 a Dominican Monastery was founded in Cochin. In 1549 Abuna Jacob, a Chaldean Bishop, stayed at St. Antonio Monastery, Cochin. In 1550, the first Jesuit House was erected in Kochi. Xavier died on 3 December 1552. Mar Jacob, the last East Syriac bishop, led the Church until his death in 1552. After his death, the Roman Catholics tightened their efforts to subdue the Church. They directed their energy towards terminating the arrival of bishops from Babylon. Even those who came disguised were caught and executed or tortured into embracing Roman Catholicism. Two or three bishops did arrive from the East Syriac Church after the death of Jacob and were harassed. Mar Abraham, who was among them, led the local church until 1599. During the subsequent period, in 1552, a split occurred within the Church of the East. Part of it joined Rome, so that besides the Catholicosate of the East another, Chaldean Patriarchate was founded, headed by the Patriarch Mar Yohannan Sulaqa (1553‚Äì1555). Both claim to be the rightful heir to the East Syriac tradition. It is difficult to see the precise influence of this schism on the Church of Malabar as there was always overtones to Rome in earlier centuries. Apparently, both parties sent bishops to India. The last East Syriac Metropolitan before the schism, Mar Jacob (1504‚Äì1552), died in 1552. Catholicos Simeon VII Denkha sent a prelate to India, in the person of Mar Abraham, who was later to be the last Syrian Metropolitan of Malabar, after having gone over to the Chaldaean side. It is not known when he arrived in Malabar, but he must have been there already by 1556. Approximately at the same time, Chaldaean Patriarch Abdisho IV (1555‚Äì1567) sent the brother of John, Mar Joseph, to Malabar as a Chaldaean bishop. Although consecrated in 1555 or 1556, Mar Joseph could not reach India before the end of 1556, nor Malabar before 1558. He was accompanied by another Chaldaean bishop, Mar Eliah. The Portuguese erected a Latin diocese in Goa in 1534 and another at Cochin in 1558 in the hope of bringing the Thomas Christians under their jurisdiction. In a Goan Synod held in 1585 it was decided to introduce the Latin liturgy and practices among the Thomas Christians. The Portuguese built the Mattancherry Palace for the King of Cochin in 1555. Pope Paul IV erected the Diocese of Cochin in 1557. The canonization process of Francis Xavier began at Cochin. The pope erected the 1565 Archdiocese of Angamaly in 1565. The Jesuits started the seminary at Vaippicotta in 1577. The Roman Catholic order of Augustinians reached Cochin in 1579. In 1583, Bishop Mar Abraham convoked a synod at Angamaly. Aleixo de Menezes, Archbishop of Goa from 1595 until his death in 1617 decided to bring the Kerala Christians under obedience after the death of Bishop Mar Abraham (the last Syrian Metropolitan of Malabar, laid to rest at St. Hormis church, Angamaly), an obedience that they conceived as complete conformity to the Roman or ‚ÄòLatin‚Äô customs. This meant separating the Nasranis not only from the Catholicosate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, but also from the Chaldaean Patriarchate of Babylon, and subjecting them directly to the Latin Archbishopric of Goa. In 1597, Bishop Mar Abraham, the last foreign Archbishop, died and was buried at St. Hormis church, Angamaly. The Synod of Diamper (1599) Immediately after the death of the local bishop, Mar Abraham, in 1599, Archbishop of Goa Aleixo de Menezes (1595‚Äì1617) convoked a Synod of Diamper and imposed Latinization and Western ecclesiastical traditions on the local Church of India. The Portuguese extended the Padroado Agreement in their evangelization programme over India, and therefore brought the Indian Church under Catholic jurisdiction. Menezes controlled the synod completely. He convoked it, presided over it, framed its decrees and executed them. The synod lasted for eight days. Almost all of the decrees were framed not in the synod after due discussion but 15 days or earlier prior to the meeting. Many of the decrees were framed after the Synod as the archbishop desired. The synodal decrees were passed by threats and terror methods, and autocratically as desired by the archbishop. The decrees forced conformance of the local church to the practices of Roman Catholics, in faith, polity, and discipline. It decreed submission to the pope. The Assyrian Patriarch of Babylon was condemned as a heretic and contact with him declared highly perilous inviting spiritual dangers. Additionally, The Malabar church was required to follow the norms declared by the Council of Trent. Priests must be celibate. The church had to be divided into parishes with the parish priest directly appointed by the Portuguese church authorities, replacing the native regime and bishopric. The powers and offices of the Roman bishop clashed with that of the archdeacon, so the latter's office was weakened, though there was still an incumbent. The church was required to abandon perceived \\"errors\\" which Jesuits believed had crept into its life from the Indian milieu. All Syriac books had to be handed over for burning so that no memory of those rites remained. The Catholic Church appointed Fr. Francis Roz bishop of Angamaly in 1599. In August, 1600 Padroado rule was imposed on the Nasranis. The church appointed Roz as the first Latin bishop of the St. Thomas Christians in 1601. The church erected the Diocese of Cranganore in 1609. They suppressed the Archdiocese of Angamaly. The Metropolitan of Goa limited the pastoral jurisdiction of Nasranis to Malabar in 1610. A Dominican Seminary was started at Kaduthuruthy in 1624. In 1626, Edappally Ashram was started for the religious community of St. Thomas Christians. About half of the people did not yield to Rome however, and although through this period the local church lacked adequate knowledge of theology and church history, it still maintained its Eastern character and ecclesiastical freedom. Among all the efforts that were undertaken to subdue the Thomas Christians, the efforts of the Jesuits, a religious order that had been framed in the context of reformation in Europe, were notable. They established a clergy training centre at Vaipikotta to train native clergy in Catholic style. The major architects behind the convocation, deliberations, framing and executing the decrees of the Synod, were the Vaipikotta Jesuits. Apart from these the administration of the local church was also entrusted to them. Until 1653, three Jesuit bishops ruled over the church executing the decrees of that Synod. These events immediately followed the synod: *The appointment of a Latin bishop over the Church of St.Thomas. *Suppression of the Metropolitan status of Angamali and bringing of it as a subordinate under Goa. *Padroado of the Portuguese was extended over the Thomas Christians. *The Thomas Christians‚Äô protest and Restoration of the Metropolitan status to Angamali and change of the place to Crangannore under the Latin bishop Roz. The Synod has since been criticized by modern scholars, both ecclesiastical and secular. The impact of the synod on the local church was decisive. Roman Catholicism was firmly established. The Synod was a turning point in the history of the Malabar Church. This relationship continued till the beginning of the second half of the 17th century. Francis Roz was the first Roman Catholic bishop over the Thomas Christians soon after the Synod. Because he had been the main architect behind the success of Udayamperoor, he was given the see over the local church. His rule lasted for 24 years. During that time he tried his best to Romanize the Thomas Christians in worship, administrative systems, customs, and discipline. Although the Synod had instructed the liturgy to be modified in accordance with the Roman custom, this was sternly opposed by the St.Thomas Christians. Therefore, Roz advocated a modified form of the ancient liturgy of the Saint Thomas Christians. He centralized in himself all authority reducing almost to nothing the powers of the archdeacon, palliyogams and kathanars of the St. Thomas‚Äô Church. This authority continued during the episcopates of Roz' two successors, Stephen Britto (1624‚Äì1641) and Francis Garzia (1641‚Äì1659). Archdeacon George of the Cross, who had been subordinated under Roz and Britto died in 1640. He was succeeded by his nephew, Archdeacon Thomas Parambil. Parambil did not cooperate with Garzia. Garzia used both ecclesiastical and civil powers to suppress the archdeacon. The Portuguese refused to accept the legitimate authority of the Indian hierarchy and its relation with the East Syriac Christians, and in 1599 at the Synod of Diamper (held in Udayamperur), the Portuguese Archbishop of Goa imposed a large number of Latinizations. The Portuguese succeeded in appointing a Latin bishop to govern the Thomas Christians, and the local Christians‚Äô customs were officially anathematised as heretical and their manuscripts were condemned to be either corrected or burnt. The Portuguese padroado (‚Äôpatronage‚Äô) was extended over them. From 1599 up to 1896 these Christians were under the Latin Bishops who were appointed either by the Portuguese Padroado or by the Roman Congregation of Pro da Fide. Every attempt to resist the latinization process was branded heretical by them. Under the indigenous leader, archdeacon, the Thomas Christians resisted, but the result was disastrous. In 1562, a Syrian bishop named Ahatallah arrived in India, claiming to be a new Patriarch of India sent by the Pope. Deciding he was an impostor, the Portuguese arrested him and arranged for him to be sent to Europe for his case to be decided. Archdeacon Thomas strongly protested and demanded to see Ahatallah in Chochin, but the Portuguese refused, saying that he had already been sent to Goa. Ahatallah was never heard from in India again, and the rumor soon spread that the Portuguese had murdered him, fomenting discontent in the Saint Thomas Christian community and leading directly to the Coonan Cross Oath.Frykenberg, p. 367‚Äì368. The Coonan Cross revolt The oppressive rule of the Portuguese padroado provoked a reaction on the part of the Christian community. The first protest took place in 1653, known as the Koonan Kurishu Satyam (Koonan Cross Oath). Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thomas, a part of the Thomas Christians publicly took an oath in Matancherry, Cochin, that they would not obey the Portuguese bishops and the Jesuit missionaries By the Father, Son and Holy Spirit that henceforth we would not adhere to the Franks, nor accept the faith of the Pope of Rome.. In the same year, in Alangad, Archdeacon Thomas was ordained, by the laying on of hands of twelve priests, as the first known indigenous Metropolitan of Kerala, under the name Mar Thoma I. After the Coonan Cross Oath, between 1661 and 1662, out of the 116 churches, the Catholics claimed seventy-two churches, leaving Archdeacon Mar Thoma I thirty-two churches and twelve churches being shared. The seventy-two churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro Malabar Catholic Church have descended. The other thirty-two churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites and Orthodox), Thozhiyur (1772), Mar Thoma (Reformed Syrians) (1874), Syro Malankra Catholic Church have originated. In 1665, Mar Gregorios Abdul Jaleel, a Bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch arrived in India and the group under the leadership of the Archdeacon Thomas welcomed him. This visit resulted in the Mar Thoma party claiming spiritual authority of the Antiochean Patriarchate and gradually introduced the West Syriac liturgy, customs and script to the Malabar Coast. The arrival of Mar Gregorios in 1665 marked the beginning of a formal association of the Thomas Christians with the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch. Those who accepted the West Syriac theological and liturgical tradition of Mar Gregorios became known as Jacobites. Those who continued with East Syriac theological and liturgical tradition and stayed faithful to the Synod of Diamper are known as the Syro- Malabar Catholic Church in communion with the Catholic Church. They got their own Syro-Malabar Hierarchy on 21 December 1923 with the Metropolitan Mar Augustine Kandathil as the Head of their Church. St. Thomas Christians by this process got divided into East Syriac and West Syriac branches. Further divisions St. Joseph's Monastery, Mannanam, where mortal remains Blessed Chavara are kept. St. Thomas cross is seen in the picture on the top of church. In 1772 the West Syriac Christians under the leadership of Kattumangattu Abraham Mar Koorilose, Metropolitan of Malankara, formed the Malabar Independent Syrian Church (Thozhiyur Sabha). From 1816 onward, the Anglican C.M.S. missionaries helped the Malankara Church through their Help Mission. But as a protest against the interference of the Anglican Church in the affairs of the Malankara Church, the Metropolitan, Cheppad Mar Dionysius, convened a Synod at Mavelikara on 16 January 1836. There it was declared that Malanakara Church would be subject to the Syrian traditions and Patriarch of Antioch.Cherian, Dr. C.V., Orthodox Christianity in India. Academic Publishers, College Road, Kottayam. 2003.p. 254-262. The declaration resulted in the separation of the CMS missionaries from the communion with the Malankara Church. However a minority from the Malankara Church, who were in favor of the reformed ideologies of the missionaries, stood along with them and joined the CMS. These Saint Thomas Anglicans or Anglican Syrian Christians, were the first reformed group from among the Saint Thomas Christians. They joined the missionaries in their evangelical activities among the non-Christians and worked along with the missionaries in their reformative and educational activities. In 1879, the Anglican diocese of Travancore and Cochin was established, in Kottayam. On 27 September 1947, a little over a month after the Indian independence, the Anglican Church in South India united with similar other reformed Churches in the region and formed the Church of South India;Dr.Juhanon Mar Thoma Metropolitan. Christianity in India and a Brief History of the Marthoma Syrian Church. Pub: K.M. Cherian. 1993. an autonomous Indian church within the Anglican Communion.Author:Sushil Mittal, Gene Thursby -Religions of South Asia: An Introduction Even while being in Anglican faith tradition, culturally, socially and linguistically CSI Syrian Christians have much in common with the other Syrian Christian groups.http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/2724/11/11_chapter%203.pdf In 1876, those who did not accept the authority of the Patriarch of Antioch remained with Thomas Mar Athanasious and chose the name Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church. They removed a number practices introduced at The Synod of Diamper to the liturgy, practices and observances. In 1961, there was a split in this group with the formation of St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India. In 1874 a section of Syro-Malabar Catholic Church from Thrissur came into communion with Patriarch of the Church of the East in Qochanis as a result of schism followed after the arrival of Bishop Rocos (1861) Mar Elias Melus (1874) sent by the Patriarch of Chaldean. They follow the East Syriac tradition and are known as Chaldean Syrian Church. However, in 1912 due to attempts by the Antiochean Patriarch to gain temporal powers over the Malankara Church, there was another split in the West Syriac community when a section declared itself an autocephalous church and announced the re- establishment of the ancient Catholicosate of the East in India. This was not accepted by those who remained loyal to the Patriarch. The two sides were reconciled in 1958 but again differences developed in 1975. Today the West Syriac community is divided into Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (in Oriental Orthodox Communion, autocephalous), Malankara Jacobite Syriac Orthodox Church (in Oriental Orthodox Communion, under Antioch). In 1930 a section of the Malankara Orthodox Church under the leadership of Mar Ivanios and Mar Theophilus came into communion with the Catholic Church, retaining all of the Church's rites, Liturgy, and autonomy. They are known as Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. Demography On a rough reckoning, about 70% to 75% of the Christians in Kerala belong to the St. Thomas Christianity spread across different denominations, including the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church, the Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church, Syro- Malankara Catholic Church, the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, the Chaldean Syrian Church and the Malabar Independent Syrian Church. About 5.2 percent of St. Thomas Christians are within the Diocese of Madhya Kerala of the Church of South India. India's official census data places the total Christian population in Kerala at 6.06 million in the year 2001. Accordingly, the population of St Thomas Christians in Kerala (who form 70%‚Äì75% of the total Christian population in the State as suggested above) may be in the region of 4.2 to 4.5 million. Since the 1950s a sizeable population of St Thomas Christians have settled in Malabar region of Kerala following the Malabar Migration. Many work or have settled outside the State in cities like Mumbai, as well as outside India in West Asia, Europe, North America and Australia.

The word thinkers is an important distinction because the program encourages leaders of every discipline to contribute, whether it be engineers, biologists, pharmacists, scientists, etc. The program is founded on the assumption that with increased support and funding, contemporary science and technology can contribute to the fight against diseases affecting the developing world. With the generous offering of grants for projects, proposals are welcomed as they fit one of a set of 14 challenges, categorized in groups among seven stated goals. With the targeting of specific challenges, the initiative focuses on a variety of health problems inherent in today's developing world. While the 14 challenges are direct, the scope of the project is comprehensive as it welcomes strategies of prevention, diagnosis, detection, examination, etc. The disciplines involved may include immunology, microbiology, genetics, molecular and cellular biology, entomology, agricultural sciences, clinical sciences, epidemiology, population and behavioral sciences, ecology and evolutionary biology, etc.  History  In January 2003, Bill Gates first announced the Grand Challenges in Global Health at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In partnership with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMFG) granted $200 million to the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH). The goal behind the initiative was to fund research to advance the fight against disease that disproportionately affects people in the world's poorest countries. At this time the scientific board's responsibilities were outlined: to identify scientific or technological innovations that have a global impact or show potential for feasibility. In May 2003, the scientific board requested ideas through widespread advertising and marketing strategies. These announcements welcomed innovative ideas, and more than 1,000 suggestions from scientists and institutions in 75 countries were submitted by July. The scientific board met to further discuss these proposals, which were presented orally with a statement of the problem, descriptions of obstacles to progress, the challenge itself, and a discussion of potential benefits and priority areas for study and application. The following questions raised during the meetings reflect the difficulty in defining these Grand Challenges: Does the proposal describe a difficult and discrete roadblock to progress? What is the likelihood that creative solutions are required and that grant proposals worthy of funding will be received to address it? Is there already substantial scientific activity aimed at solving the problem, which would make the intent of a grand challenge redundant? What are possible impacts on various diseases if the challenge is successfully met? Will envisioned advances be suitable for implementation in poorer parts of the world? In October 2003, the scientific board announced the 14 Grand Challenges. In August 2004, the evaluation of letters from around the world led to over 400 full proposals. Experts assessed proposals and the Executive Committee of the scientific board and staff members from FNIH and BMGF reviewed the projects to move into the negotiations for grants. In May 2005, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation gave an additional $250 million to fund research for the initiative, bringing the foundation's commitment to $450 million. In June 2005, the initiative announced grants for 43 new projects, attracting international partners. Today, the work towards revolutionary advances in global health continues. 44 separate research projects are currently being managed, and solving even one of the 14 challenges could potentially improve the lives of millions.  The Grand Challenges  Goal 1: Improve Vaccines * Grand Challenge #1: Create Effective Single-Dose Vaccines that Can be used Soon After Birth :Potential benefits of this challenge include increased effectiveness of immunization, decreased cost of immunization systems, and decreased deaths in early childhood. One project to combat this challenge that is currently underway is the development of a live recombinant attenuated salmonella anti pneumococcal vaccine for newborns, which is being investigated by Dr. Roy Curtiss III at Arizona State University. * Grand Challenge #2: Prepare Vaccines that Do Not Require Refrigeration :Potential benefits include increased efficacy of immunization systems as well as reduced cost of vaccine delivery. Dr. Abraham L. Sonenschein and his team at Tufts University School of Medicine are currently working to develop childhood vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis that can endure a wide range of temperatures with the encapsulation of heat- resistant bacterial spores. * Grand Challenge #3: Develop Needle-Free Delivery Systems for Vaccines :Potential benefits include improved access and compliance and the avoidance of infection from the re-use of needles. Dr. James R. Baker and a team at the University of Michigan are working on a way of preparing vaccines that can be given as nasal drops, eliminating the need for preservatives or refrigeration Goal 2: Create New Vaccines * Grand Challenge #4: Devise Reliable Tests in Model Systems to Evaluate Live- attenuated Vaccines :The priority areas for this challenge are viruses refractory to vaccine development, pathogenic bacteria, and complex pathogens such as protozoa and fungi. Dr. Hongkui Deng of Peking University in China is currently working with his colleagues to create mouse models with immune systems and livers that are similar enough to humans to allow testing of potential HIV and HCV vaccines. * Grand Challenge #5: Solve How to Design Antigens for Effective, Protective immunity :The priority areas for this challenge involve HIV and malaria. Dr. Ralph Steinman and his team are currently developing vaccines that stimulate the immune system's dendritic cells, which are known to help protect against infectious diseases. * Grand Challenge #6: Learn Which Immunological Responses Provide Protective immunity :A potential benefit of this challenge is the establishment of new diagnostic and prognostic tools for assessing public health. Dr. Patrick E. Duffy's team at the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute is currently attempting to identify the antibodies and other immunological responses that help protect children from death due to malaria. Goal 3: Control Insect Vectors * Grand Challenge #7: Develop a Genetic Strategy to Deplete or Incapacitate a Disease- transmitting Insect Population :The priority areas for this challenge include malaria, dengue, and other tropical arboviral diseases. Dr. Scott O'Neill of the University of Queensland in Australia is attempting to modify mosquito population age structure in order to eliminate dengue transmission. * Grand Challenge #8: Develop a Chemical Strategy to Deplete or Incapacitate a Disease-transmitting Insect Population :The hope with this challenge is that this challenge will effectively disrupt the diseases transmission cycle. At Virginia Tech University, Dr. Jeffery Bloomquist and a team are using molecular modeling and a new chemical synthesis method known as \\"click chemistry\\" to produce insecticides targeted to the primary malaria vector mosquitoes, Anopheles gambiae. Goal 4: Improve Nutrition * Grand Challenge #9: Create a Full Range of Optimal, Bioavailable Nutrients in a Single Staple Plant Species :To improve nutrition, this grand challenge focuses on iron, zinc, and selenium deficiencies. At Ohio State University, Dr. Richard Sayre is leading a team of scientists to create nutritious cassava for sub-Saharan Africa. Goal 5: Limit Drug Resistance * Grand Challenge #10: Discover Drugs and Delivery Systems that Minimize the Likelihood of Drug Resistant Micro- organisms :This challenge focuses on TB, Malaria, and HIV. Potential benefits include reduced treatment failures and simple treatment regimens. Dr. Brett Finlay and a team at the University of British Columbia are investigating new therapeutics that boost innate immunity to treat infectious diseases. Goal 6: Cure Infection * Grand Challenge #11: Create Therapies that Can Cure Latent Infection :This challenge focuses on HIV, HBV, Herpes, TB, Schistosomiasis, and Toxoplasmosis. Dr. Douglas Young of the Imperial College in London is leading researchers from the U.K, U.S., Singapore, Korea, and Mexico to further expose the biology of latency and then develop drugs against latent TB * Grand Challenge #12: Create Immunological Methods that Can Cure Latent Infection :This challenge focuses on similar priority areas as Challenge #11, and Dr. Robert Garcea and a group of researchers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine are working to identify the best protein candidate for a therapeutic vaccine that will target HPV infection. Goal 7: Measure Health Status * Grand Challenge #13: Develop Technologies that Permit Quantitative Assessment of Population Health :Potential benefits include a standardized global system for assessing the status of population health as well as accurate assessment of injury, disease prevalence, and incidence. Dr. Christopher Murray and international investigators are working to develop ways to assess and measure mortality. * Grand Challenge #14: Develop Technologies that Allow Assessment of Individuals for Multiple Conditions or Pathogens at Point of Care :A potential benefit of this challenge is the rapid detection and diagnoses of disease exposure. At Northwestern University, Dr. David Kelso's team is trying to develop rapid and affordable point-of-care systems. Today: The GCGH is launching a new Grand Challenge in Family Health. Currently, two new grant opportunities exist under this challenge: * Discover New Ways to Achieve Health Growth :A potential benefit of this challenge might lead to new methods of aiding the development of prevention of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), stunting, and wasting of newborns and infants in the developing world.\\"Grand Challenges: Achieving Healthy Growth Grant Opportunity.\\" Grand Challenges in Global Health. Web. 12 Dec. 2011. * Preventing Preterm Birth :Potential benefits of this initiate could lead to low-cost technologies that reduce the global problem of prematurity  Explorations Grand Challenges Explorations promotes invention in global health research. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has committed $100 million to support scientists across the world in increasing the span of ideas to fight our most daunting health challenges. Launched in 2008, Grand Challenge Explorations grants have already been awarded to 495 researchers from 42 countries. Currently, nearly 500 researchers from over 40 countries are using Grand Challenges Explorations grants to experiment with groundbreaking ideas. While some are pursuing radioactivity to kill infected cells, others are trying to develop a waterless toilet that is cost efficient as well as environmentally productive. The Explorations grant initiative requires two short page applications but no preliminary data. Applications are submitted online. Initial grants of $100,000 are awarded two times a year. Successful projects have the opportunity to receive a follow-on grant of up to $1 million and could eventually evolve into Grand Challenges project.\\"Explorations.\\" Grand Challenges in Global Health. Web. 12 Dec. 2011. .  ESC Program  The key challenge associated with such large-scale research projects called for by the initiative is the addressing of ethical, social, and cultural (ESC) issues related to the Grand Challenges. Dr. Peter Singer and Dr. James Lavery and a team of colleagues are employing projects to address these barriers, but for the GCGH initiative to be successful, compliance and collaboration with this concept is absolutely critical.  Project Goal  The Ethical, Social, and Cultural Program of the Grand Challenges in Global Health, launched in 2005, is targeted to address the ethical, social, and cultural issues that may arise as a result of the initiative- either in the development of the research itself, or in the implementation of knowledge and technology by the communities in need. The GCGH ESC program is the first significant science project concentrated entirely on ESC issues linked to the developing world. ESC issues can have a series of consequences that involve new technologies and approaches: rejection of safety precautions or genetically modified foods, for example, because of culture sensitivity or perceived health, environmental, or economic risks. The ESC program assumes that science and technology are essential to global health development, but the appropriate development of this technology requires attention to the accompanying ethical, social and cultural issues. The program aims to link ESC activities with the research projects and to include voices from the developing world within these projects. Its two main goals are (1) to provide an advisory service for GCGH projects and (2) to create a research program to facilitate appropriate adoption of them in the long-term. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is in compliance with this idea and granted money in November 2005 for the program to be carried out. The program is described and discussed at length in a series of four articles published in PLoS Medicine.  ESC Issues  In defining ESC issues, the program's creators underwent a process of document analysis, group discussions with investigators and program staff, and interviews with experts from the developing world. The findings include thirteen issues that include: community engagement, public engagement, cultural acceptability, gender, post-trail obligations/benefit sharing, collaboration, the involvement of civil society organizations, affordability, accessibility, regulatory issues, collection, management, and storage of tissue samples, corruption and poor governance, and unintended consequences.  Program milestones  = Advisory service = The ESC advisory service was created to address ESC issues identified at the start of GCGH research projects, as well as challenges encountered as projects progress. The aim is to work in a close, unified way with the investigators on ESC issues appearing in their projects and thus guide the achievement of their milestones. An advisory service co-leader and a lead bioethicist are assigned to each GCGH project. During the initial phase of communication, the co-leader and lead bioethicist define the issues and develop a strategy for addressing the challenge's issues based on their specific expertise. A process of consultation with the GCGH program officers has also been implemented to help identify issues within the challenges and its individual projects. The program officers often join the advisory service conference calls and offer expertise and insights that help anticipate ESC concerns. = Research program = The goal of the research program is to provide knowledge in order to facilitate the successful adoption of technology by GCGH's targeted communities. With working papers, working groups, global case studies, and demonstration projects on public engagement, research enhances the ESC expertise with respect to specific goals of the Grand Challenges.  Criticism  As is the case with most health initiatives, the GCGH have been subject to a fair degree of criticism. A very widely circulated critique was published in 2005 in The Lancet. In the column, Anne-Emanuelle Birn, Sc.D., an associate professor of Public Health Sciences at the University of Toronto, described the initiate's role as \\"weak\\" for focusing too narrowly on the power of science and neglecting the importance of economic, social, and political factors. She cites the 20th century cultural obsession with technological advancement as one that cannot ignore the need to redistribute economic and social resources within impoverished communities. She suggests that rather than trying to finance, develop and distribute new and existing vaccines, a more sustainable effort might focus on public support for a universal, accessible public health system. She references Goal #4, which involves improved nutrition, as a specific challenge that is shortsighted and \\"overlooks key distributional questions.\\" She explains that because malnutrition and famine are not the result of technical obstacles, but rather, political and economic ones, technology is not the answer. These issues are not about supply or the lack of nutritional value available in foods, but rather, poor income distribution and market shifts leading to populations unable to afford food.

The fragrance, released in December 2011 at Nordstrom, is a similar concept to her first fragrance Purr. Conception and background After the success of her previous fragrance Purr, Katy decided along with Gigantic Parfums to design her second fragrance. She said \\"It's a sister fragrance. Purr to me was a little bit more floral, and Meow is a little bit more sweet. It was probably because of the California Dreams Tour that it was more of the confectionery world, because everything I've seen for the last year has been like cotton-candy scented or huge peppermints or massive gummy bears.\\" Perry also described the perfume as \\"edible\\". Packaging and scent The scent of the perfume is known to be more \\"sweet\\" than its previous bottle. The bottle is a cat-shaped bottle which is basically the same as its previous bottle, other than that it is light pink and the collar is the letter \\"M\\". Meow's scent has ingredients including pear, honeysuckle, and vanilla. The fragrance also features small scents of musk and amber as well. Release On December 1, 2011, Katy confirmed that the launch of the perfume would be on December 13, 2011, at Nordstrom stores. However, before this date the perfume was already out for pre-order.

It was the first major conflict in South Carolina in the war, having been preceded by bloodless seizures of several military fortifications in the province. Patriot forces under the command of Major Andrew Williamson had been dispatched to the area to recover a shipment of gunpowder and ammunition intended for the Cherokees that had been seized by Loyalists. Williamson's force, numbering over 500, established a stockaded fort near Ninety Six, where it was surrounded by some 1,900 Loyalists. Because the war was in its early days and the partisan war in the southern back country had not become as brutal as it would be later in the war, the siege was conducted desultorily, and was effectively a stalemate. After two days the Loyalists withdrew, having lost four killed and 20 wounded to one Patriot killed and 12 wounded. The Patriots also withdrew toward the coast, but a major Patriot expedition not long after resulted in the arrest or flight of most of the Loyalist leadership. Background When the American Revolutionary War began in Massachusetts in April 1775, the free population of the Province of South Carolina was divided in its reaction.Alden, pp. 199‚Äì200 Many English coastal residents were either neutral or favored the rebellion, while significant numbers of back country residents, many of whom were German and Scottish immigrants, were opposed.Alden, pp. 7, 9, 199‚Äì200 Loyalist sentiment in the back country was dominated by Thomas Fletchall, a vocal and active opponent of Patriot attempts to resist King and Parliament.Krawczynski, p. 156Alden, p. 200 By August 1775 tensions between Patriot and Loyalist in the province had escalated to the point where both sides had raised sizable militia forces.Cann, p. 204 Events were largely nonviolent for some time, although there were isolated instances of tarring and feathering, but tensions were high as the sides struggled for control of munitions. The Council of Safety in early August sent William Henry Drayton and Reverend William Tennent to Ninety Six to rally Patriot support and suppress growing Loyalist support in the back country.Dunkerly and Williams, p. 21 Drayton was able to negotiate a tenuous truce with Fletchall in September.Krawczynski, pp. 186‚Äì189 On September 15, Patriot militia seized Fort Johnson, the principal fortification overlooking the Charleston harbor. Governor William Campbell dissolved the provincial assembly, and fearing for his personal safety, fled to the Royal Navy sloop of war . This left the Patriot Council of Safety in control of the provincial capital.McCrady, pp. 68‚Äì69 The council began improving and expanding Charleston's coastal defenses; eventually this culminated in a bloodless exchange of cannon fire between Patriot positions and Royal Navy ships in the harbor on November 11 and 12.McCrady, p. 77 Matters also escalated after the seizure by Loyalists in October of a shipment of gunpowder and ammunition sent by the Council of Safety and intended for the Cherokee. The council responded by organizing a large-scale expedition to recover the munitions.Cann, p. 207 On November 8 it voted to send Colonel Richard Richardson, the commander of the Camden militia, to recover the shipment and arrest Loyalist leaders. Siege While Richardson gathered his forces, Major Andrew Williamson, who had already been recruiting in the back country, learned of the gunpowder seizure. He arrived at Ninety Six early on November 19 with 560 men. Finding the small town to be not very defensible, he established a camp on John Savage's plantation, provided a field of fire for the force's three swivel guns. He began fortifying the camp, ordering the construction of an improvised stockade.Cann, p. 209 Loyalist recruiting had been more successful: Williamson had learned that Captain Patrick Cuningham and Major Joseph Robinson were leading a large Loyalist force (estimated to number about 1,900) toward Ninety Six.McCrady, p. 89Dunkerly and Williams, p. 22 In a war council that day, the Patriot leaders decided against marching out to face the Loyalists. The Loyalists arrived the next day, and surrounded the Patriot camp.McCrady, pp. 89‚Äì90 Map showing the area around Ninety Six, including Williamson's fort The leaders of the two factions were in the midst of negotiating an end to the standoff when two Patriot militiamen were seized by Loyalists outside the stockade. This set off a gunfight that lasted for about two hours. The next morning the two sides resumed firing at each other at long range. The Loyalists attempted to set fires, creating a smokescreen they could use to approach the stockade. This attempt was frustrated by the wet ground. The Loyalists next constructed a large wooden shield behind which they sought to bring incendiaries closer to the fort, but they only succeeded in \\"[setting] Fire to their own Engine themselves\\", according to one account, and it was not proof against the Patriot's guns.Cann, p. 210 On the afternoon of November 21 the Patriots held a war council, in which they decided to sortie that night. They were preparing for this action at sunset when a Loyalist approached with a parley flag. Nothing was decided in the discussion beyond an agreement to meet the next morning. In that meeting, the Loyalists agreed to withdraw across the Saluda River and the Patriots agreed to destroy the fort. Both sides were to return prisoners taken since November 2 and not interfere with each other's communications with their respective political leaders. The Patriot leaders were also required to surrender their swivel guns, although they were returned three days later.Cann, p. 211 The truce also included reinforcements for both sides, terms that the Council of Safety claimed did not apply to Colonel Richardson's force.Cann, p. 212 Aftermath The reasons why the Loyalists chose to negotiate the truce are unknown. Governor Campbell described the Loyalists as lacking in effective leadership, and historian Martin Cann speculates that it may have been caused by Colonel Richardson's preparations or approach.Krawczynski, p. 207 Richardson mobilized 2,500 men, which grew by the end of November to more than 4,000. This force scoured the back country, arresting or driving away most of the Loyalist leadership. The campaign effectively ended on December 22, when of snow fell on the area. Richardson's men, unprepared for the snow, made a difficult trek back to the lowlands.Cann, pp. 212‚Äì213 Some of the Loyalist leaders who escaped Richardson's expedition, including most notably Thomas Brown, fled to West Florida where they joined regular and irregular forces serving with the British. These events resulted in the end of large-scale Loyalist activity in the southern Appalachians, although what was in many ways a civil war became progressively more brutal in the following years.Cann, pp. 213‚Äì214 Ninety Six became a British outpost after the 1780 Siege of Charleston, and was besieged in 1781 by forces under the command of Nathanael Greene. Although Greene was forced to lift that siege by the approach of a relief force, the British abandoned Ninety Six not long afterward.Dunkerly and Williams, pp. 24‚Äì25, 69 Order of Battle Patriots: Commanding Officer - Major Andrew Williamson of the Ninety-Six District Regiment of Militia. * Ninety-Six District Regiment led by Major Andrew Williamson with the twelve known companies * Little River District Regiment detachment including five known companies * Camden District Regiment detachment including two known companies * New Acquisition District Regiment detachment led by Capt.

It runs from south to north through the Malemba-Nkulu Territory of Haut-Lomami Province and the Manono Territory of Tanganyika Province, passing the twin tin-mining towns of Kitotolo and Manono shortly before entering the Luvua. In the early 1800s, King Kumwimbe of the Luba Kingdom created a client state that united the Hemba villages of the Lukushi River valley, and that played an important role in preserving Luba dominance over other small states in the region. In 1932 Geomines was building a reservoir on the Lukushi River to contain of water to support tin mining operations at Manono. Water would be pumped from the reserve for washing operations in the dry season. A 1950 report on a campaign to eliminate malaria by spraying dwellings with DDT said the Lukushi River had been progressively silted up by tailings from mining operations. It now formed an immense swamp, with many old quarries that were excellent breeding places for malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Malaria was a serious problem at Manono. A 1981 USAID project examined agricultural activity around Manono and the Lukushi valley based on aerial photographs. It found relatively little cultivation in 1957, with about of land in use. By 1978 the agricultural activity had increased fourfold, mostly within a radius of Manono and Kitotolo and along the Lukushi to the north and south of Manono. However, by 1980 the zone of cultivation around Manono and Kitotolo had shrunk significantly. More smallholdings were being cultivated along the Luvua and upstream from Manono, and fewer downstream from Manono. Part of the change could be attributed to wetter ground in the downstream regions, but the main factor seemed to be economic problems due to deterioration of the mines in Manono.

His real identity remains a secret, and he always wears a skull mask in his appearances.  Biography  Roffe Ruff was raised in Majorna, the district in Gothenburg that receives most performing royalties from STIM‚Äîthe Swedish collecting society. He played in his first band at the age of twelve, and recorded rap songs on a DAT recorder together with a friend when he was seventeen. They made a go for it in the music business three years later and Roffe loved the feeling to be on stage, but hated the feeling after a gig, as he felt self-contempt over the fact that his stage personality‚Äîthat emanated confidence‚Äîwas a lie not reflecting the real him. His first appearance as a solo artist (under the name Roffe the Ruffler), after several years in different bands, came in 2007 when he was offered to record a single for the hit disc Mr. Gillis Reggaepropaganda vol. 2. He sent a card of himself disguised with a skull mask for the cover, the future trademark appearance of Roffe Ruff. He was fired from his job not long after, unrightfully and against Swedish labour law according to himself. His frustration and vindictiveness was vented in his first album Ormar i gr√§set that was released in 2009. The album was published on his website, downloadable free of charge. Roffe Ruff states that due to the lack of fair ways for artists to make money on their music, he chooses to \\"fool everyone including myself on the profits\\". The anonymous release of his music was a liberation, there were no expectations on him and for the first time he could look himself in the mirror without being ashamed of the music. People also seemed to concentrate more on the music and less on the person, allowing people to interpret his music more freely. As Ormar i gr√§set was released uncontrolled there are no sales statistics, but the songs from the album have been played over 450,000 times on YouTube‚Äîaround 100,000 plays more than the songs from Joakim Th√•str√∂m's K√§rlek √§r for dom, the Swedish Grammy Award album for 2009‚Äîand Roffe Ruff was observed in a much wider sphere than he anticipated. The next project, Panterparken EP, a cooperation with his friend and colleague Hofm√§starn, was originally meant to be a short four-track EP but was expanded to nine tracks in the end. It was released in 2010, and was made available free of charge by Roffe Ruff on for example The Pirate Bay. The anonymity created by the mask and the artist name‚Äîthat at first seemed to have solved his lifelong dilemma‚Äîsoon became a burden when the interest for the man behind the mask was spurred by the mysterious and withdrawn personality. Since Roffe Ruff and his childhood friend sent merchandise from the address where their secret studio was located, unthoughtful in retrospect, more and more people in his neighbourhood figured out the real identity. On New Year's Day 2010 the studio was subject to a burglary, and even one of the policemen who was sent to the crime scene had figured out that Roffe Ruff was one of the victims. A big fan of the artist that has recorded the song Snutsvin (\\"cop pig\\"), the policeman asked if he could get a hold of a Roffe Ruff shirt anywhere. Being exposed in just the way he did not want to be, Roffe Ruff's third album Barrabas released in 2011‚Äîdownloadable for free just as the previous ones. For the first time the songs are about his anonymity, stating that \\"when I made my previous album I was so naive, I though I was in control of myself and my life. I know now that I was wrong, and that is why I am quitting now. But first I have to do an album that speaks for itself.\\" 2013 the latest album called Bootlegs was released. The album contains 17 tracks recorded together with Rico Won, Snacka San, Hofm√§starn, Daltone, Tommy Tip, Organismen. The album contains new and previous released songs at YouTube.  Musical style  Roffe Ruff's albums are a mix of Swedish hip hop, reggae, ragga and dancehall. The atmosphere is mostly dark and the lyric themes include police harassment, criticism of various community institutions, old memories, alienation, depression, social class and consolation drinking. Some of his early songs were created by adding his own texts over the beat of well-known English-speaking artists' productions, such as Chamillionaire's Day dream (became Snutsvin) and Estelle's and Kanye West's American Boy (became Majornapojk), while his last album Barrabas consisted entirely of new productions.

Built in 1880‚Äì1881 mostly of oak and white pine by John Bear, who had previously built barns, the total cost to the Township of Woolwich was $3,197.50.http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/discoveringTheRegion/resources/2014_West_Montrose_Bridge_Plaque_FINAL_lores_FINAL- ACCESS.pdf The structure can still be used by pedestrians, buggy traffic and vehicles weighing less than three tonnes for crossing the Grand River.http://www.woolwich.ca/en/tourism/thingstodo_kissing_bridge.asp Since 1998, it has been owned and maintained by the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. The bridge's original design was described as a \\"two-span hybrid Howe truss\\" or as a \\"hybrid Queen Post ‚Äì Howe timber configuration\\" with two louvred windows.http://env- web2.uwaterloo.ca/hrcresearch/attachments/5101eba41b59b2.23220210.pdf (Additional windows, visible today, were added at some later date.) The entire structure was originally built of wood. Its weight was supported by 15 piles driven deep into the river bed.http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/discoveringTheRegion/West_Montrose_Covered_Bridge.asp At the time of construction, the estimated useful life of the structure was 70 to 80 years. That was significantly increased with subsequent restorations. The primary modifications during restorations added concrete and steel parts to strengthen the aging structure.http://www.raqsa.mto.gov.on.ca/techpubs/eps.nsf/9ea013f0de8096ba8525729700557ad1/7e600b5d5b55032f85257706004c574a/$FILE/Ontario%20Heritage%20Bridge%20Guidelines- Interim%20-%20Jan%2011%2008.pdf However, the current visible form of the bridge remains true to the original design.http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=8291 History Wooden trusses in the interior The first records of this bridge include a call for tender in 1880 by John L. Wideman of nearby St. Jacobs, Ontario for a covered bridge to span the Grand River. The cost would be shared by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation and Communications and the township of Woolwich. The contract was given to the Bear Bros., John and Benjamin. Drawings and five pages of specs were completed by John Bear who indicated that hardwood was used throughout, although the rafters and the sheets over the sides would be made of pine. The wood was obtained from the nearby villages of Bridgeport, Blair and Doon. The opening date of the bridge was 15 November 1881 but it was not painted (with \\"residual oil and fire proof paint\\") until May of the following year.http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/discoveringTheRegion/West_Montrose_Covered_Bridge.asp Starting in the mid 1800s, this area of Waterloo County was settled primarily by Mennonite Germans from Pennsylvania. The horse and buggy was the primary transportation and in winter, the wheels were replaced with sleigh runners. This required the township to hire an individual to shovel snow onto the bridge roadway to avoid damage to the flooring. From 1885 until 1950, coal oil lamps were lit inside the bridge overnight; they were replaced by electric bulbs.http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/discoveringTheRegion/resources/2014_West_Montrose_Bridge_Plaque_FINAL_lores_FINAL- ACCESS.pdf This was not the first covered bridge in Waterloo County. The Shingle Bridge in Blair (part of Preston, Ontario), was built before 1835 and it was the first of this type but was destroyed by flood waters in 1857.http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/discoveringTheRegion/West_Montrose_Covered_Bridge.asp By 1900, there were only five covered bridges in all of Ontario and no others in this area. Several restorations were completed over the years. The wooden abutments were replaced with concrete some time after 1900.http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/discoveringTheRegion/West_Montrose_Covered_Bridge.asp In 1904, new planks were laid over the oak floor. New wooden trusses were installed in 1933. In 1955, part of the floor was replaced and covered with crushed stone. In 1959, parts from an old Bailey truss bridge were used to replace the internal structure; metal parts were hidden by pine panels. The roof was re-shingled in 1987 and some beams were replaced in 1995 and 1996. In late 2012 to early 2013, a floor beam replacement and some roof repairs were completed.http://www.therecord.com/news-story/2619776-bridgekeepers-group- wants-better-care-of-west-montrose-bridge/http://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/west- montrose-covered-bridge-closed-for-repairs-1.966534 In 1959, the township diverted traffic onto the new Highway 86 (now Township Line 86) after constructing a new concrete bridge. This strategy minimized the number of vehicles driving through the small settlement and helped to lengthen the useful life of the covered bridge.http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/discoveringTheRegion/resources/2014_West_Montrose_Bridge_Plaque_FINAL_lores_FINAL- ACCESS.pdf The \\"Kissing Bridge\\" Locals driving their horse and buggy rigs began to call the structure the \\"kissing bridge\\": a kiss (in relative privacy inside the bridge) was required as a toll to cross it. A historical summary indicates that \\"local girls learned to be wary when their escort's horse stopped inside the bridge without any command from the driver\\".http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/discoveringTheRegion/West_Montrose_Covered_Bridge.asp This is the reason for the name of The Kissing Bridge Trailway for hikers which passes through this settlement.http://www.kissingbridgetrailway.ca/ Heritage designations The West Montrose Covered Bridge was designated as a Provincial Historic Site in August 1960. In 2007, the Township of Woolwich designated it as being of cultural heritage value or interest under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act (By-law 60-2007).http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/discoveringTheRegion/resources/2014_West_Montrose_Bridge_Plaque_FINAL_lores_FINAL- ACCESS.pdfhttp://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/cmsimages/f6/f62ecf60-60a0-476f-b838-d382841ec2aa.pdf It was listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places on 28 November 2007.http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=8291 In 2018, the structure was one of the eight recognized under the region's Heritage Bridge Recognition Program.

The company is based in Braunschweig, Germany, commonly known as Brunswick in English. Grotrian-Steinweg makes premium grand pianos and upright pianos. Grotrian-Steinweg grand piano inner mechanism Grotrian- Steinweg's history dates back to 1835 when the first Steinweg piano factory was built by Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (later known as Henry Steinway after his emigration to the US where he founded Steinway & Sons). In 1856, Friedrich Grotrian became a partner; in 1865 his son Wilhelm Grotrian and two associates bought the factory and the right to market their pianos as successors to the Steinweg brand. Ensuing generations of Grotrian family members led the company to become one of the finest piano manufacturers in Germany. Grotrian-Steinweg pianos were preferred by some famous pianists, and they received accolades at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Grotrian-Steinweg operated an orchestra and a concert hall, and established sales rooms in a half dozen major cities in Germany, and by 1920, in London as well. At its peak in the late 1920s, Grotrian-Steinweg employed 1,000 people and made 3,000 pianos per year. Economic depression in the 1930s and war in the 1940s caused Grotrian- Steinweg to decline severely and then lose its factory completely. The family rebuilt the factory and re-established its reputation for quality work. In the 1950s, an annual piano-playing competition was founded by the company, to identify promising young piano students. Grotrian-Steinweg sought to expand into the US in the mid-1960s. Steinway & Sons sued to prevent them from using the Steinweg name, resulting in a 1975 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The case set a precedent in describing \\"initial interest confusion\\": that the brand Grotrian-Steinweg could cause piano buyers to temporarily confuse its brand with the brand Steinway & Sons. The court ordered Grotrian-Steinweg to stop selling pianos in the US under the \\"Steinweg\\" name. Afterward, the company formed a business entity named Grotrian Piano Company to sell pianos in North America. 19th century On 13 January 1803, Georg Friedrich Karl Grotrian, called Friedrich, was born in Sch√∂ningen, Germany. He settled in Moscow to sell pianos, beginning around 1830. He joined a partnership in a small piano making firm based in Saint Petersburg, and included these pianos among the various instruments he sold in his successful Moscow music shop. In Germany, Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg (1797‚Äì1871) started making pianos in 1835 from his house in Seesen at the edge of the Harz mountains; a source of fine beech and spruce wood for the instruments. Among the pianos that Steinweg produced in his first year was a square piano designed by and built for Friedrick Grotrian. (This instrument is now in the Braunschweig museum.) H.E. Steinweg entered three of his pianos in a state fair in 1839, two of them square pianos, but his grand piano brought wide notice. In 1850, H.E. Steinweg took most of his large family to New York City, leaving the piano factory to his eldest son C.F. Theodor Steinweg (1825‚Äì1889) who stayed behind to run it under his own name. Meanwhile, in New York City, the Steinweg family Americanized their surname to Steinway and in 1853 they founded the piano manufacturer Steinway & Sons. An early piano branded \\"Th. Steinweg Nachf.\\", meaning \\"successor to Theodor Steinweg\\" Soon after taking ownership of his father's old factory, C.F. Theodor Steinweg moved it to Wolfenb√ºttel near Braunschweig. Here he met Friedrich Grotrian who was traveling for business. In 1854, Friedrich Grotrian received the M√ºller- M√ºhlenbein pharmacy as an inheritance from an uncle, so he moved back to Germany to manage it. He joined C.F. Theodor Steinweg's piano company as a partner in 1856. The Grotrian-Steinweg residence and piano-making workshop in Braunschweig In 1857, C.F. Theodor Steinweg and Grotrian moved the piano factory to Braunschweig, setting up shop in a former mayor's mansion at 48 Bohlweg Street in the inner, medieval part of the city. The company employed about 25 people at this time. Friedrich Grotrian died on 11 December 1860, leaving his share of the company to his son Wilhelm (1843‚Äì1917). In 1865, C.F. Theodor Steinweg was needed by his family in New York to help manage Steinway & Sons after his brothers Henry and Charles died. Wilhelm Grotrian joined with two of the piano workmen‚ÄîAdolph Helfferich and H.D.W. Schulz‚Äîto buy out C.F. Theodor Steinweg's share of the building. The new partnership paid for the right to use the trademark \\"C.F. Th. Steinweg Nachf.\\", meaning, \\"Successor to C.F. Theodor Steinweg.\\" (Nachf. is an abbreviation for Nachfolger‚ÄîGerman for successor.) The company name became \\"Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf.\\" Wilhelm Grotrian raised two sons in the 1870s: Wilhelm \\"Willi\\" Grotrian Jr (1868‚Äì1931) and Kurt Grotrian (1870‚Äì1929). In New York City, C.F. Theodor Steinweg (H.E. Steinweg's son) changed his name to C.F. Theodore Steinway, and served as the leader and chief technician of Steinway & Sons for fifteen years. He did not like living in the US, so he kept his home in Braunschweig and traveled back and forth as needed. In 1880 he stopped traveling overseas and started a new Steinway & Sons piano factory in Hamburg, competing with his father's old firm, now called Grotrian-Steinweg, in making pianos for European customers. After establishing the business, Steinway retired to Braunschweig for his last years. He died in 1889, leaving his collection of pianos to the city's museum. The Hamburg factory proved successful in competing against Grotrian-Steinweg‚Äîboth companies were known for producing premium pianos.Ratcliffe, 1989, p. 46 In the 1880s, Willi Grotrian studied piano making with Wm. Knabe & Co. in Baltimore, Maryland, and with Pleyel, Wolff et Cie in Paris, France. Kurt Grotrian also studied with piano makers in other countries. Their father Wilhelm Grotrian Sr took Willi with him to Chicago in 1893; there, at the World's Columbian Exposition, Grotrian-Steinweg won an award for fine quality. Pianists Eugen d'Albert, Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Clara Schumann expressed a preference for Grotrian- Steinweg pianos. Grotrian-Steinweg was counted among the top German piano manufacturers along with Bechstein, Bl√ºthner, Feurich, Ibach, Lipp and the Hamburg division of Steinway.Ripin, 1997, p. 61. In 1895, Wilhelm Grotrian Sr made his two sons partners in the business. He told them, \\"Lads, build good pianos and the rest will take care of itself.\\" The original German sentence is \\"Jungs, baut gute Klaviere ‚Äì dann kommt alles andere von selbst.\\" Willi Grotrian methodically set about to improve the systems and standards the Grotrian-Steinweg company used to produce pianos. The Grotrian-Steinweg brand was well known for being of the highest quality: the company was named purveyor to some 30 \\"Kaisers, Kings and royal houses\\". Part 2. The owners Franz Wilhelm Grotrian, Willi Grotrian and Kurt Grotrian were awarded an imperial and royal warrant of appointment to the court of Austria-Hungary. 20th century The Grotrian-Steinweg Concert Hall in Braunschweig In Braunschweig, Grotrian-Steinweg grew to a workforce of 550 by 1913, producing about 1,600 pianos annually. The Grotrian-Steinweg Orchestra was active in Leipzig under the baton of young conductor Hermann Scherchen. Grotrian- dedicated salesrooms were operating in Leipzig, Hanover, K√∂nigsberg, D√ºsseldorf and Berlin. During World War I, Kurt Grotrian left the factory to serve in the German Army. He was soon wounded and taken prisoner of war. The elder Wilhelm Grotrian died in 1917. Willi Grotrian, his son, led the company but it was greatly reduced in manpower and orders for pianos. After the war, the company resumed as before, expanding sales in 1920 by establishing a London shop under the brand name Grotrian-Steinweg. The workforce increased to 1,000. In 1924, Grotrian-Steinweg built an unusual piano for microtonal music composer Ivan Wyschnegradsky. The piano had three manuals, and strings tuned a quarter tone apart.Ripin, 1997, p. 71. By 1927, Grotrian-Steinweg was making about 3,000 pianos annually. This number dropped significantly in the 1930s during the Great Depression; fewer than 500 pianos were made in 1931, and the workforce was reduced to less than 200.Petersen, 2011, p. 81. Kurt Grotrian had become seriously ill in the late 1920s, and in 1928 he made his two sons Erwin (1899‚Äì1990) and Helmut (1900‚Äì1977) shareholders. In 1929, Kurt Grotrian died of complications from his old war wound. Hosted by le-clavier.com Willi Grotrian died in 1931. A Grotrian-Steinweg piano amid bombing destruction in 1945 In World War II, the Grotrian-Steinweg factory (like many others in Germany) was ordered to switch to fabricating parts for aircraft. The factory was destroyed in 1944 by the bombing of Braunschweig, as was the founder's mansion in the center of town. Afterward, Erwin and Helmut rebuilt the factory. By 1948, production had resumed; composer and pianist Wilhelm Kempff went on record as an admirer of the \\"sonority and exquisite execution\\" of the post-war work. Piano performance competition A Grotrian-Steinweg upright piano with its signature radial rear brace adding strength In 1954, Grotrian- Steinweg initiated a piano-playing competition known as Grotrian-Steinweg Klavierspielwettbewerb, featuring young pianists from music schools. The competition took place in the Braunschweig location of the Hertie department store, with audience applause used as the gauge to determine the winner. In 1968, Grotrian-Steinweg entered into talks with the German National Music Council and the Hannover University of Music to increase the scale of the competition. It increased in odd years to encompass a national and international scope. Pianists such as Ragna Schirmer and Lars Vogt gained notice as winners of the competition. Trademark conflict The first trademark friction between the two piano manufacturers occurred in 1895 when Steinway & Sons sued to stop Grotrian-Steinweg from using the name \\"Steinweg\\" on its pianos. Steinway lost the case, but in January 1919, Willi and Kurt Grotrian decided to change the family surname to Grotrian-Steinweg to protect the trademark of the family business, in the hope of preventing further lawsuits. In 1925, the company established a sales presence in the US as a Delaware corporation called Grotrian-Steinweg Company. Over the next three years, Grotrian-Steinweg sold only 15 pianos in the US, in addition to a few sold by an independent dealer in New York City. Upon discovering the sales in 1928, Steinway & Sons complained to the distributor and to Grotrian-Steinweg, but in 1929 Grotrian-Steinweg sent 47 pianos to the US. A family representative of Steinway went to Germany to discuss the problem directly with the Grotrian-Steinweg family. Arriving at a private agreement, the two family leaders smoked a \\"peace cigar\\" and Grotrian-Steinweg subsequently stopped using the names \\"Steinweg\\" and \\"Grotrian-Steinweg\\" in the US. In 1930 the Delaware corporation was dissolved, and in the next three years exports from Grotrian-Steinweg to the US decreased then halted completely. In 1950, Grotrian-Steinweg relinquished its old 1926 trademark application, which had never been published. In 1961, Knut Grotrian-Steinweg (b. 1935) joined the company. In 1966, the company formed a contract with Wurlitzer to sell Grotrian-Steinweg pianos in the US, and the Steinway company brought suit in New York. The case lasted nine years, winding its way through trial courts and district courts, presenting the litigants' counterclaims and appeals. In 1975, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard the arguments in Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf. v. Steinway & Sons. Grotrian-Steinweg, the plaintiff, argued that their brand was long established, predating Steinway's in Germany. Steinway & Sons, defendant, counterclaimed that their brand, well known and strongly positive in the US, was weakened by consumers' confusion as to whether the pianos were related. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling in favor of the defendant that piano buyers would be misled in their \\"initial interest\\" in the two piano brands; \\"a potential Steinway buyer may satisfy himself that the less expensive Grotrian-Steinweg is at least as good, if not better, than a Steinway.\\" The court felt that Grotrian-Steinweg‚Äîa brand not very well known in the US‚Äîwas unfairly given an extra measure of credibility based on the strong reputation that Steinway & Sons had built. Even though premium piano buyers were understood to be sophisticated and knowledgeable, and would not be confused at the time of purchase about which manufacturer produced which piano, the court held that a \\"subliminal confusion\\" might be present at the initial attraction to the Grotrian-Steinweg brand. The company was forbidden to sell pianos in the US under the name \\"Steinweg\\" after 1977. Accordingly, in 1976 Grotrian-Steinweg formed a subsidiary brand for selling pianos in North America: Grotrian Piano Company GmbH. The case was the first instance of a court defining the concept now known as \\"initial interest confusion\\". District Judge Lloyd Francis MacMahon wrote: \\"Misled into an initial interest, a potential Steinway buyer may satisfy himself that the less expensive Grotrian- Steinweg is at least as good, if not better, than a Steinway.\\" MacMahon's idea about the \\"initial interest\\" confusion was confirmed by Appeals Court Judge William H. Timbers, writing, \\"such initial confusion works an injury to Steinway.\\" The English-language section of Grotrian's website does not have any reference to the surname \\"Steinweg\\", unlike the French-, German- and Russian-language versions. This is likely a result of the lawsuit and a wish to minimize liability. Current operations A double instrument made for performing piano duos In 1974, the Grotrian-Steinweg family built a new factory in northwest Braunschweig on Grotrian-Steinweg Street, very near Bundesautobahn 2, a major east‚Äìwest highway. After Helmut and Erwin Grotrian- Steinweg supervised the construction they retired, leaving Helmut's son Knut in charge. This factory is the current location of Grotrian-Steinweg production. In 1999, Knut Grotrian-Steinweg stepped down from active supervision of the company, and put day-to-day control in the hands of Burkhard Stein, an industrial manager and piano builder. As of 2012, the Grotrian-Steinweg company is owned by the daughters of Erwin Grotrian, with sixth-generation Jobst Grotrian (b. 1969), Knut's son, a shareholder. Annually, the company produces about 500 upright pianos in six sizes and 100 grand pianos in five sizes. Some 20 concert grands are made per year‚Äîeach one requiring 8 months of manufacture.Knize, 2009, p. 302. In 2010, the company issued a special 175-year anniversary model, a upright called Compos√© Exclusif, of which 50 were produced. In 2011, Larry Fine opined that modern Grotrian-Steinweg pianos are among the \\"highest quality\\"‚Äîon par with Hamburg- built Steinways, Faziolis, and B√∂sendorfers and of a higher quality than New York-built Steinways.

In June 2009, the two teams working on next-generation bomber proposals were told to \\"close up shop\\".RL34406, \\"Air Force Next-Generation Bomber: Background and Issues for Congress\\" . Congressional Research Service, 18 September 2009 On 16 September 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates endorsed the concept of a new bomber but insisted that it must be affordable,\\"Gates endorses new U.S. bomber project\\". Reuters stating: \\"What we must not do is repeat what happened with our last manned bomber. By the time the research, development, and requirements processes ran their course, the aircraft, despite its great capability, turned out to be so expensive ‚Äì $2 billion each in the case of the B-2 Spirit‚Äîthat less than one-sixth of the planned fleet of 132 was ever built.\\" On 5 October 2009, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Ashton Carter said that the DoD was still deciding if the USAF needed a new bomber and that, if approved, the aircraft would need to handle reconnaissance as well as strike missions.\\"Carter: DoD, White House Crafting New Presidential Helo Specs\\". Defense News In July 2010, Carter said he intended to \\"make affordability a requirement\\" for the next-generation intelligence and strike platform. On 11 December 2009, Gates said that the QDR had shown the need for both manned and unmanned long range strike and that the 2011 budget would likely include funding for the future bomber. The USAF plans for the new bomber to be multi-role with intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.Fulghum, David A. \\"New Bomber To Focus Heavily On ISR\\". Aviation Week, 17 December 2009. As a bomber, the LRS-B will be under Air Force Global Strike Command, while ISR assets are managed by Air Combat Command's 25th Air Force. In 2010, Andrew Krepinevich, director of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, questioned a reliance on short range aircraft like the F-35 to manage China in a future conflict and promoted reducing the F-35 buy in favor of a longer range platform like the Next- Generation Bomber; then-United States Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne had rejected this plan in 2007.Clark, Colin. \\"Strategy, What Strategy?\\" dodbuzz.com, 29 June 2010.

On 6 January 2011, Secretary of Defense Gates made a speech on the U.S. defense budget for FY 2012, which announced major investment in developing a long-range, nuclear-capable bomber, also to be optionally remotely piloted. He also said the aircraft \\"will be designed and developed using proven technologies, an approach that should make it possible to deliver this capability on schedule and in quantity. It is important that we begin this project now to ensure that a new bomber can be ready before the current aging fleet goes out of service. The follow on bomber represents a key component of a joint portfolio of conventional deep-strike capabilities‚Äîan area that should be a high priority for future defense investment given the anti-access challenges our military faces.\\" In July 2011, Joint Chief Vice Chairman James Cartwright called for a large UAV instead of a manned aircraft, including for the nuclear mission.Tirpak, John A. \\"Confessions of a 'Bomber Hater'.\\" Air Force Magazine, 15 July 2011. Retired Air Force colonel and Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments analyst Mark Gunzinger has called for an optionally manned bomber, stating that purely unmanned bombers would be at a disadvantage without direct human pilot awareness and vulnerable to communication disruption. In March 2011, the USAF decided to purchase 80 to 100 aircraft.Reed, John. \\"Air Force Hopes to Buy 80 to 100 Next Gen Bombers.\\" DoD Buzz, 30 March 2011.Erwin, Sandra. \\"Air Force Chief: We Will Not 'Overdesign' the New Stealth Bomber.\\" National Defense Industrial Association. 9 February 2012.

AirForce Magazine, Daily Report, 25 June 2010. In addition to the strategic bombing, tactical bombing, and prompt global strike roles typical for a bomber, the aircraft is to be part of a family of systems responsible for ground surveillance and electronic attack. The Obama Administration in its 2012 budget request asked for $197 million and a total of $3.7 billion over five years to develop the bomber, including modular payloads for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), electronic attack (EA), and communications.Majumdar, Dave. \\"Budget shrinks; acquisition programs outlined\\" AirForce Times, 15 February 2011.Shane, Leo. \\"Budget breakdown: Air Force.\\" Stars and Stripes, 14 February 2011.

In 2011, the House Armed Services Committee added language that would require two engine programs for the bomber; Ashton Carter objected that the addition would interfere with plans to reuse an existing engine.Bedard, Paul. \\"Pentagon, Obama Bomb House Bid To Revive Jet Engine.\\" US News, 24 May 2011. Reportedly, the two most likely engines are the Pratt & Whitney PW9000 engine, which uses a combination of Pratt & Whitney F135 and commercial turbofan technology, and a derivative of the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136. In May 2011, Air Force Undersecretary Erin Conaton announced that a program office was being set up for the bomber. The USAF asked for $292 million for the program in its 2013 budget request.Munoz, Carlo. \\"DoD Fast Tracks New Bomber; 'Planning Number' is $550 Million Per Plane.\\" AOL Defense. 15 February 2012. The program has also been referred to as \\"Long-Range Strike-B\\" (LRS-B).Butler, Amy. \\"Amid Cuts USAF Cautiously Funds F-35, Bomber.\\" Aviation Week. 13 February 2012. In 2012, former Pentagon weapons tester Thomas P. Christie speculated that the bomber program had been initiated so that the Air Force would have a sacrificial program to offer during anticipated defense budget shortfalls.Axe, David. \\"Why Can't the Air Force Build an Affordable Plane?\\" The Atlantic. 26 March 2012. The USAF seems committed to the program, given a lack of other non-nuclear options to deal with \\"deeply buried and/or hardened targets,\\"\\"U.S. Air Force Is 'Committed' To Long-Range Strike Bomber.\\"\\"Air Force Wants A Bomber That Balances Cost With Capability.\\" and committed two percent of their investment budget to the project, compared to three percent to sustain existing bombers.\\"Sec. Donley: Why The Air Force Can't Delay Modernization.\\" As of August 2013, the USAF believes that the LRS-B can reach Initial Operating Capability (IOC) in 2025. Reportedly, the main risk is funding, in light of the F-35 Lightning II's acquisition difficulties and a lack of an \\"urgent threat\\". Prior bomber programs were hindered by a lack of funding, only 21 B-2 Spirits were produced out of 132 planned and fewer B-1 Lancers were built than were envisioned; both programs were scaled down due to spiraling per aircraft costs. Research funding was allocated, as stealthy technologies to counter anti-access/area- denial threats were spared from budget cuts. The USAF stated the LRS-B is a top priority as it is believed that China will overcome the B-2's low- observable features by the 2020s. Where possible, existing technologies and proven subsystems will be used in order to keep it within budget, instead of developing new and riskier ones. Components such as engines and radars may be off-the-shelf or adaptions of existing models, such as derivative technologies of the F-35. The LRS-B is intended to perform any long range mission, rather than one specialized mission, which drove up the cost of the B-2. The USAF expects it to cost $1 billion each with development costs factored in, and aims for a per-aircraft cost of $550 million, considered reasonable for a limited production run military aircraft.\\"Budget Pressures Seen as Biggest Risk to Long Range Bomber Program\\" . National Defense Magazine, September 2013. On 25 October 2013, Boeing and Lockheed Martin announced their teaming up for the LRS-B. Boeing will be the prime contractor. The two companies previously joined together for the program in 2008, but the partnership ended in 2010 when requirements shifted. Boeing believes that as the program had evolved, they can readdress their partnership to specifically address requirements. The team has Boeing's bomber experience and Lockheed Martin's stealth experience. At the time of the announcement, official details about the LRS-B were that it will likely be optionally manned and use stealth technology.Boeing, Lockheed Team on Long Range Strike Bomber ‚Äì Defensenews.com, 25 October 2013 On 30 January 2014, Northrop Grumman stated their intention to invest in developing needed technology for the bomber, such as stealth designs, mission management systems, and autonomous controls.Northrop to ‚Äòposition‚Äô for future bomber work as LRS-B progresses ‚Äì FlightGlobal, 4 February 2014 In January 2014, General Schwartz said that the Pentagon should abandon plans to outfit the F-35 with nuclear weapons in favor of the LRS-B. A 2010 Nuclear Posture Review stated that replacing the F-16 with the F-35 retains dual conventional and nuclear delivery capabilities for USAF fighters. The Congressional Budget Office determined that upgrading the F-35 for nuclear deployment would cost $350 million over the next decade. Schwartz said that without financial support from NATO, where some nuclear- capable F-35s would be deployed, those funds should be transferred to the LRS-B. At the same time, Congress cut funding for the B61 nuclear bomb, stripping $10 million from F-35 integration and $34.8 million for life extension; Schwartz stated that B61's life extension must proceed. On 20 February 2014, the USAF reasserted the bomber's need at the annual Air Force Association Air Warfare Symposium in Orlando, Fla. It was stated it will be fielded in the mid-2020s, and between 80 and 100 of the bombers will be procured. Lt. Gen. Burton Field clarified the 80 to 100 range is due to uncertainty over the price rather than a figure representing the minimum number of bombers needed to mitigate risk.USAF Defends Need for New Long-Range Bomber Defense News, 20 February 2014 Some USAF leaders expect the unit cost limit of $550 million per aircraft will be exceeded with additional equipment added to the airframe. The cost goal is to set design constraints to prevent extra requirements for capability growth desires and untested technologies that would increase the price more from being incorporated during development. Though the final cost may be greater than planned, a fixed price objective is expected to keep average procurement costs affordable.General: 'Of course' new Air Force bomber will be more than $550M per plane ‚Äì Military Times, 5 March 2014 Rather than the price ceiling being too low to meet requirements, the USAF sees this arrangement as itself and the potential contractor being disciplined about the bomber's missions and roles. Research and development expenses are likely to be \\"significant\\", but not expected to be double the cost of production aircraft.Air Force Keeps Bomber Price Tag at $550 Million ‚Äì DoDBuzz.com, 12 March 2014 The USAF intended to release a full request for proposals (RFP), a final RFP, and begin the competition for the Long-Range Strike Bomber in fall 2014. Two teams, Northrop Grumman and Boeing‚ÄìLockheed Martin, were working on pre-proposals for the competition. In June 2014, the USAF revealed that the LRS-B RFP would be released \\"soon,\\" with proposals to be submitted by fall 2014 and evaluations completed in early 2015, with a contract award after that. Some public information includes that it will be operational in the mid-2020s, based on existing technologies, have a large payload, may possibly be optionally-manned, and is being designed to work with a \\"family of systems\\" that includes ISR, electronic attack, and communication systems. Early aircraft will be designed around fixed requirements with mature technologies that will be adaptable through open architecture for future sensor and weapons capabilities.RFP for bomber coming soon, Air Force's top buyer says ‚Äì Military Times, 13 June 2014 Although the LRS-B request for proposals (RFP) was to be released by the end of June, the USAF hesitated to publicly announce it to keep the process fair and less likely to give sensitive information to \\"potential adversaries\\". Public announcements of future acquisition milestones are to be \\"released as appropriate.\\"Bomber RFP News to Stay Hidden ‚Äì AirForce Magazine, 27 June 2014 Competitive phase The USAF released its RFP for the LRS-B on 9 July 2014. By entering the competitive phase of acquisition, the USAF is limited with what it is able to release, and few details were expected to be made public until the contract is awarded in the second quarter of 2015. The LRS-B is expected to replace the B-52 fleet, possibly replace a portion of the B-1 fleet, and complement the B-2 fleet. According to an Air Force study, the Boeing B-52 Stratofortresses and Rockwell B-1 Lancers currently in inventory will reach the end of their service lives by 2045.http://www.janes.com/article/70824/us-air-force-could- substantially-increase-b-21-buy Northrop Grumman could base production in Florida if they won the contract, which would provide tax credits, while California passed a bill offering tax credits to the manufacturer if they build it in their state, which would mainly benefit the Boeing‚ÄìLockheed Martin team.Air Force sends next-gen bomber requirements to industry, few details made public - AirForcetimes.com, 10 July 2014USAF launches competition for new bomber - Flightglobal.com, 11 July 2014 On 14 August 2014, the California legislature passed a measure to apply tax benefits equally to prime and subcontractors. The previous measure only applied to subcontractors, meaning Lockheed Martin as part of the Boeing‚ÄìLockheed Martin team, placing Northrop Grumman at a near half-billion-dollar disadvantage in the bidding; the new measure levels the tax benefit field by also applying them to prime contractors, as Northrop Grumman has no subcontractor and also has operations in Palmdale.Northrop Bomber Team Relieved Over California Legislation - Aviationweek.com, 15 August 2014 With a target price of $550 million per aircraft, Defense News quoted a source with knowledge of the program predicting that the LRS-B may be smaller than the B-2, perhaps half the size, powered by two engines in the Pratt & Whitney F135 power class.Shrouded in Mystery, New Bomber Makes Waves - Defensenews.com, 19 January 2015 The target unit cost of $550 million is based on 2010 dollars and is $606 million in 2016 dollars. One of the program's main effects will be its impact on the industrial base; three of the country's five largest defense firms are competing. After the LRS-B, the USAF will not have another major attack aircraft program until the 2030s for a new fighter, with a follow-on bomber after that. With that stretch of time in between, the loser may be forced to leave the industry entirely; Northrop Grumman would likely not retain the infrastructure required for the next major undertaking, and Boeing's main aircraft field is now its commercial products. Industrial impact may cause any contract to be contested by Congress from representatives that receive campaign donations from a company whose award would create jobs for constituents. In addition to competing with other USAF priorities, budgets may put the LRS-B at odds with other services' priorities such as the Columbia- class submarine. In April 2015, Pentagon undersecretary for acquisition Frank Kendall revealed that individual technologies for the LRS-B will be competed to enhance flexibility, increase competition, and drive down costs. This means even though one team will build the aircraft, other competitors will have the chance to compete for sustainment and upgrade features.Kendall: New AF Bomber Will Compete Upgrades - Defensenews.com, 9 April 2015 Although a contract was planned to be awarded in early summer 2015, it was pushed back to September 2015 to ensure the optimal contractor was selected. Prolonging this part of the process is seen as a time and money-saver later in the acquisition to ensure the resulting bomber can be useful over a 50-year lifespan.Air Force Plans Bomber Contract for September - Military.com, 22 July 2015 In September 2015, the USAF revealed that the LRS-B's development was much further along than had been publicly acknowledged, and more than usual before a contract award. Final requirements had been finalized since May 2013. Both competitors had mature proposals with prototyping activities and wind tunnel tests along with subsystems, although no demonstrator had been built. The designs are \\"very different\\" from each other with different teams on subsystems such as engines, electronic warfare suites, and communications systems; subcontractors will likely not be announced when the winner is picked. The bomber seems similar to the B-2, but more advanced using improved materials for superior low observability, similar to or smaller in size, and will operate alone or as part of a strike package with other airborne assets. Conducting of tests and risk reduction this early in the acquisition process is in part because the program has been handled by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office since 2011, which has more freedom in how it procures technologies. To reduce risk, the aircraft's production rate will probably remain steady and fairly modest over the course of the aircraft's production.LRS-B Details Emerge: Major Testing, Risk Reduction Complete - Defensenews.com, 2 September 2015New details emerge about LRS-B as contract announcement nears - Flightglobal.com, 4 September 2015 In late September 2015, the contract award was again delayed. Contract award On 27 October 2015, the Defense Department awarded the development contract to Northrop Grumman. The initial value of the contract is $21.4 billion, but the deal could eventually be worth up to $80 billion. The deciding factor in the selection of the Northrop design was cost.http://www.janes.com/article/64991/northrop-grumman-beat-boeing- for-b-21-on-cost On 6 November 2015, Boeing and Lockheed Martin protested the decision to the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

About 97,000 left for Israel by plane and ship from Casablanca and Tangier via France and Italy. The accession of Hassan II on 26 February 1961 enabled negotiations to begin on a secret agreement between Mossad's \\"Misgeret\\" division and the Moroccan authorities (principally Prince Moulay Ali and labour minister Abdelkader Benjelloun), together with the American organisation HIAS. An economic arrangement was agreed between Israel and Morocco, with the agreement of Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and King Hassan II of Morocco, whereby $500,000 would be paid as a downpayment, plus $100 per emigrant for the first 50,000 Moroccan Jews, and then, $250 per emigrant thereafter.Frederic ABECASSIS , QUESTIONS ABOUT JEWISH MIGRATIONS FROM MOROCCO \\"OPERATION MURAL\\" (SUMMER 1961): RETURN FROM DIASPORA OR FORMATION OF A NEW DIASPORA? \\"Since 1960, indirect talks had been initiated between the Israeli authorities and the heir to the throne, and even with the leftist leader, Mehdi Ben Barka (Bin-Nun, 2008). According to Yigal Bin Nun (2009), the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs was progressively convinced to consider financial compensation to the departure of the Jews, as it had been done in Iraq and Romania. In early May 1961, Isser Harel, the Director of the Mossad, decided to entrust to Alex Gatmon, chief of the Misgeret in Morocco, the mission to contact Jewish intermediaries to start negotiations with the Moroccan authorities. By the end of July, with the collaboration of Sam Benazeraf and Dr Isaac Cohen Olivar, he was negotiating with Abdelkader Benjelloun (Minister of Labour) and Moulay Ali Alaoui (the King's cousin and brother-in-law) and came to a compromise agreement. An economic clause was planned: half a million dollars would be paid as a down payment for the emigration of 50,000 Moroccan Jews to Europe, and then, 100$ per capita (250$ after the 50,000th). A humanitarian association, The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) would be the fa√ßade for the Israeli emissaries. The Moroccan authorities demanded that the Jews leave Morocco as entire families and not as single and selected migrants, as was the case since 1953. Furthermore, Alex Gatmon refused to dissolve his network \\"Misgeret\\" in Morocco, and clandestine emigration kept on until the end of the negotiations. Rapha√´l Spanien, the HIAS representative in Morocco, negotiated with colonel Oufkir collective passports issue by the Ministry of Interior. By the end of November 1961, Operation Yakhin had begun. From then till 1964, 97,005 Jews left Morocco with the tacit agreement of the Moroccan authorities.\\"In Ishmael's House: A History of Jews in Muslim Lands, Martin Gilbert, p279 The operation also received important help from Francoist Spain.\\"In the shadow of the Holocaust and the Inquisition: Israel's relations with Francoist Spain\\", by Raanan Rein, p.197. However, some Jews settled in France, Canada and the United States instead of in Israel. Morocco received \\"indemnities\\" for the loss of the Jews.\\"The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in modern times\\", by Reeva S. Simon, Michael M. Laskier, Sara Reguer, p.502. The operation was fronted by the New York-based Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, who financed approximately $50 million of costs. Etymology The operation's name Yachin was of Biblical origin - being the name of one of the two central pillars that supported the Holy Temple built in Jerusalem by King Solomon, and since Israel regarded immigration as a major pillar that supported the existence of the Jewish state.Every spy a prince: the complete history of Israel's intelligence community, by Daniel Raviv, Yossi Melman, p.111. Background The Jewish community of Morocco spans nearly 2,000 years. During the 1948 Anti-Jewish Riots in Oujda and Jerada 44 Jews were massacred in the northeastern Moroccan towns of Oujda and Jerada. This event contributed to a dramatic upsurge in the departure of Jews from Morocco, most of them to Israel. On May 14, 1948 ‚Äì the Moroccan sultan, Mohammed V, delivered a speech in which he warned his country‚Äôs Jews not to demonstrate \\"solidarity with the Zionist aggression.\\" If before Oujda and Jereda there had been a stream of Jews departing Morocco, afterward the immigration became even more extensive. During the next year, 18,000 of Morocco‚Äôs 250,000 or so Jews left for Israel. Between 1948 and 1956, when emigration was prohibited, the number reached about 110,000.https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-this-day-44-dead-after-anti- jewish-rioting-in-morocco-1.5251018 At the time, Morocco was home to the largest Jewish community in North Africa. Fears that Moroccan independence, which appeared increasingly likely through the early 1950s, would lead to persecution of the Jewish community led to an initial wave of migrants. From 1948 to 1951, approximately 28,000 Jews emigrated from Morocco to Israel. Upon Moroccan independence from French colonial rule in 1956, full rights and status were conferred to the Jewish population under the subsequent reign of Mohammed V. Nonetheless, immigration to Israel continued. In 1959, under pressure from the Arab League and facing the specter of the Jewish population's continued decline, emigration to Israel was prohibited, narrowing Jews' options for leaving the country. Despite retention efforts, Moroccan immigration to Israel rose to approximately 95,000 Jews for the period spanning 1952-1960. The formal prohibition on emigration remained in place only through February 1961. While the formal prohibition was ended, Mohammed V maintained a clear public preference that the Jewish community remain within Morocco and barred foreign action to facilitate or encourage emigration. Beginning in 1960, Israeli authorities engaged Moroccan officials in discussions intended to negotiate the facilitation of Jewish immigration to Israel with official (or, at least semi-official) blessing. Even with the removal of the prohibition on such movement, these talks continued. Eventually, this evolved into Operation Yakhin. On 10 January 1961 a small boat called Egoz carrying 44 Jewish emigrants sank on the northern coast of Morocco.\\"King Hassan II: Morocco's messenger of peace\\", by Megan Melissa Cross, pp.66-67. This created a crisis both for the Moroccan authorities and for the foreign aid groups responsible for assisting the refugees.

Stewart began his military career as captain of a Pennsylvania infantry company at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. He served as an aide-de-camp to Horatio Gates for a year with the rank of major. Given command of the Pennsylvania State Regiment, which later became the 13th Pennsylvania Regiment, Stewart led his troops with distinction at Brandywine and Germantown in 1777. He was wounded while leading a detachment at the Battle of Monmouth in the summer of 1778. Despite Stewart's ability to cool tensions during the 1780 mutiny of the Connecticut Line, his regiment later became involved in the Pennsylvania Line Mutiny. He was married in Philadelphia in 1781 before going south with the army to fight in the decisive Siege of Yorktown. After the British surrender, Stewart was deeply involved in the Newburgh Conspiracy. Following a term as Inspector General, he retired from the army at the beginning of 1783, and became a successful Philadelphia businessman and a general in the state militia. On February 4, 1784 George Washington wrote to Captain General Luis de Unzaga y Am√©zaga 'le Conciliateur' recommending to General Walter Stewart that he needed to resolve pending economic issues on the island of Cuba. On August 26, 1784 Luis de Unzaga y Am√©zaga responded to George Washington about the attention paid to General Walter Stewart and the success he had had in his efforts in Cuba Cazorla Granados, Frank, Garcia Baena, Rosa, Polo Rubio, J.

He died on June 16, 1796 during an outbreak of yellow fever. Early life Stewart was born into a Scotch-Irish family in Ireland in 1756, probably in Londonderry. He settled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania around 1772 and worked for a relative named Conyngham.Pulgar- Thompson, General Walter Stewart Military career Early career In January 1776 he was appointed captain of Company F, 3rd Pennsylvania Battalion. The eight company strong 3rd Battalion was authorized on December 9, 1775 and organized between January and March 1776 in Philadelphia. It joined George Washington's main army on June 11, 1776 and was assigned to Thomas Mifflin's brigade.Wright, 262 However, in May Stewart was promoted to major and became aide-de-camp to Horatio Gates when that general transferred to the Northern Department. In December 1776, Gates returned to the Philadelphia area with the Northern Department's New Jersey and Pennsylvania regiments.Boatner, 412 That November, Congress voted Stewart a $100 sword as recognition of his services.Loane, Colonel Walter Stewart One Continental Army private recalled that the ladies of Philadelphia called the good-looking Stewart the \\"Irish Beauty\\". Another observer described him as, \\"of fair, florid complexion, vivacious, intelligent and well-educated, and, it was said, was the handsomest man in the American army\\". On June 17, 1777, Stewart was named commander of the Pennsylvania State Regiment, which later became the 13th Pennsylvania Regiment. Stewart, who was Gates' subordinate for over a year, took his former chief's side in the political struggle between Gates and his rival Philip Schuyler. When Gates assumed command of the Northern Department in August 1777, Stewart wrote him, \\"You can't Imagine my Dear Sir, the Satisfaction it gives me your being sent back to your proper Command. It is so great a thing, to get the better so Nobly of that petty party, for I can call them by no other Name.\\"McGuire (2006), 119 In another letter to Gates, he wrote of his fellow Pennsylvanian Anthony Wayne having to dig trenches, \\"We are throwing up a few works at Wilmington, where Wayne is like a mad bear, it falling to his brigade. I believe he heartily wishes all engineers at the devil.\\"McGuire (2006), 150 Philadelphia campaign Col. Walter Stewart in a 1781 portrait by Charles Willson Peale At the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, the Pennsylvania State Regiment fought with the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, and 14th Virginia Regiments in George Weedon's Brigade.McGuire (2006), 243 Another authority wrote that the 2nd Virginia Brigade consisted of the 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th Virginia, but it is possible that some units were attached and others detached.Wright, 283-291 That day, Washington with 11,000 men offered battle to British General Sir William Howe's 12,500 troops. While 5,000 British and Hessians under Wilhelm von Knyphausen threatened the American center, Howe took 7,500 men in a wide turning movement that crossed the Brandywine beyond the American right flank. Belatedly detecting Howe's column, Washington deployed the divisions of John Sullivan, Lord Stirling, and Adam Stephen to halt the attempted envelopment. After severe fighting, Howe's force cracked the American line. Leaving Wayne to hold off Knyphausen, Washington ordered the division of Nathanael Greene to block Howe.Boatner, 104-109 After his brigade endured a three or four-mile double-time march in 45 minutes, Weedon arranged his troops on a reverse slope behind a fence. He swung the right flank forward behind a fence and some woods so as to take any attackers in enfilade. Henry Monckton's 2nd Grenadier Battalion blundered into Weedon's trap as dusk fell. As his men came under heavy fire, Monckton asked Hessian Captain Johann von Ewald to ride and get help. The Hessian found James Agnew who brought up his 4th Brigade on Monckton's left.McGuire (2006), 255-257 One of Agnew's regiments, the 64th Foot was roughly treated, losing 47 of its 420 men in the vicious firefight that followed. The Pennsylvania State Regiment was evidently part of the thrown-forward right flank. One witness recalled the unit's colonel, \\"Stewart on foot, in its rear, animating his men.\\" An officer in the regiment wrote that, \\"Our regiment fought at one stand about an hour under incessant fire, and yet the loss was less than at Long Island; neither were we so near each other as at Princeton, our common distance being about 50 yards.\\"McGuire (2006), 258-259 With the assistance of some artillery, the British finally forced the Americans back, but the exhausted victors did not pursue in the dark.McGuire (2006), 260 Stewart led a detachment of his regiment at the Battle of Germantown on October 4, 1777. As Greene's wing advanced on the British positions, Stewart's unit covered Weedon's left flank where a gap had developed between that brigade and Alexander McDougall's Connecticut Brigade. After driving off two British light infantry companies, his men captured an earthwork near Luken's Mill. He wrote Gates, \\"I took a little redoubt with three Pieces of Cannon from them\\". He noted that, \\"It was cursed Hot work for it before they left them\\". He noted that his men started fighting from Germantown and penetrated the British lines as far as the Market House.McGuire (2007), 102-103 Another officer recalled that the Pennsylvania State Regiment had overcome all resistance in its front. When it was attacked on its left and rear, \\"Gen. Steven [Stephen] ordered Col. Stewart to evacuate the ground\\".McGuire (2007), 109 On November 12, 1777, the regiment was renamed the 13th Pennsylvania Regiment.Wright, 268 Monmouth After Sir Henry Clinton evacuated Philadelphia and marched toward New York, George Washington moved his army northeast from Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. After crossing the Delaware at Coryell's Ferry, the Americans reached Hopewell, New Jersey on June 23. From there, they moved to intercept Clinton's retreat. Washington appointed his second-in-command Charles Lee (general) to lead his advance guard.Morrissey, 40-41 Lee's division included Varnum's 300-man Brigade under John Durkee with two cannons, William Grayson's 600-strong detachment with two guns, William Maxwell's 1,000-man New Jersey Brigade with two cannons, Henry Jackson's 300-strong detachment, Charles Scott's 1,440-strong command with four guns, and Anthony Wayne's 1,000-man command with two guns. There were seven special detachments of troops averaging about 350 men each and these were probably drawn from their parent brigades and other units. Scott led four detachments while Wayne led three detachments. Wayne's command included detachments led by James Wesson of Ebenezer Learned's Massachusetts Brigade, Henry Livingston Jr. of Enoch Poor's New Hampshire and New York brigade, and Stewart.Morrissey, 85. The author lists Stewart as \\"unattached\\". Wright did not list the brigade in which the 13th Pennsylvania served. Very early on June 28, 1778, Wilhelm von Knyphausen's division set out from Monmouth Court House, followed a few hours later by Cornwallis' division. Lee neglected to scout the area and announced to his subordinates that he had no plan of battle other than to act according to circumstances. He only began moving forward at 7:00 am with 5,000 troops to bring on the Battle of Monmouth. When Lee began to threaten the British rear guard, Clinton turned back to help with powerful forces. After some tentative attacks, Lee's troops began withdrawing in confusion but not panic. Clinton rushed in pursuit.Boatner, 719-721 Washington met Lee's retreating division late in the morning and took measures to halt Clinton's advance. Washington relieved Lee of command, but later allowed him to patch together a defensive line with the available troops. Lee put Varnum's Brigade, now under the command of Jeremiah Olney behind a hedgerow. Livingston's detachment filed into line on Olney's left. On the left flank of the position, Washington asked Stewart and Nathaniel Ramsey, who took over from the wounded Wesson, to hold off the British until he could get the main army in position. The two readily agreed. Soon after, Anthony Wayne appeared and ordered the two detachments to hold a thick wood. Ramsey formed on the extreme left with Stewart to his right. Lee's chief of artillery, Eleazer Oswald placed two cannons on Olney's right and two more in support of Stewart and Ramsey.Morrissey, 65 As the 1st Guards Battalion came abreast of the woods, the Americans riddled their flank and dropped British Colonel Henry Trelawney and 40 guardsmen. But the crack Brigade of Guards and two companies of the 1st Grenadier Battalion stormed into the woods. Early in the action, Stewart went down,Morrissey, 69 shot in the groin, and was carried to the rear.Preston, 330 The outnumbered Americans were pressed back from the trees and attacked by the 16th Light Dragoons in the open. Ramsey was wounded and captured by the dragoons while the Americans made a dash for the bridge across the ravine. After another epic struggle on the other flank, Olney, Livingston, and Oswald were forced back. But the holding actions gave Washington time to deploy Lord Stirling's division athwart Clinton's advance.Morrissey, 70 Command of the 2nd Pennsylvania Regiment Detail of Surrender of Lord Cornwallis by John Trumbull, showing Colonels Alexander Hamilton, John Laurens, and Walter Stewart Stewart assumed command of the 2nd Pennsylvania Regiment on July 1, 1778, as the senior officer remaining after enlistments ran out for most of the men of the 13th and the remaining men were consolidated with the 2nd Regiment. He earned a good reputation with his soldiers by paying close attention to their needs. In Fall 1778, he traveled to Philadelphia to secure some items for his troops. He wrote his friend Anthony Wayne, perhaps with tongue in cheek, that the ladies, \\"have really got the art of throwing themselves into the most wanton and amorous postures\\", when he was around. When elements of the Connecticut Line mutinied in 1780 at Morristown, New Jersey, the \\"dependable\\" Pennsylvania regiment surrounded them and restored order.Martin & Lender, 161 At the time, Stewart and other Pennsylvanians reassured the soldiers that their problems were no worse than in other units. Stewart then spoke with the Connecticut officers on behalf of the disgruntled rank and file. Connecticut private Joseph Plumb Martin recalled that Stewart was highly regarded by his own men. Stewart's regiment joined the Pennsylvania Line Mutiny, which began on January 1, 1781 at Morristown. At the beginning of the mutiny, most of the 2nd Regiment's soldiers balked at participating; however, after being threatened by mutineers, the 2nd Regiment joined in the march on Philadelphia. Ignoring orders from their officers, soldiers had assembled under the direction of their sergeants, armed themselves, and had begun to march south toward Philadelphia. Three officers were slain. The soldiers had a number of grievances that were viewed as legitimate, and at Trenton, New Jersey, troops negotiated with representatives of Congress and won important concessions, including a new bounty.Martin & Lender, 162-163 Afterward, the Pennsylvania Line was reorganized, and Stewart was placed in charge of a new combat unit.Loane, 2nd Pennsylvania Green Spring and Yorktown On July 6, 1781, Stewart led a Pennsylvania battalion at the Battle of Green Spring. At first, his troops formed the reserve of Wayne's 500-man advance guard. After being reinforced to 900 men by the addition of one light infantry and two Pennsylvania battalions, the Americans walked into a British ambush. Outnumbered seven-to-one, Wayne ordered a counterattack. This bold action and the approach of nightfall allowed the Americans to escape with only 28 killed, 99 wounded, and 12 missing. The British suffered 75 casualties.Boatner, 451 In October 1781, Stewart participated in the Siege of Yorktown as commander of the 1st Pennsylvania Battalion in General Wayne's brigade of Von Steuben's division.Boatner, 1240 Newburgh conspiracy Stewart retired from the army on January 1, 1783. However, Washington convinced him to stay on as Inspector General of the Northern Department. Soon after, he became involved with the Newburgh Conspiracy. By the winter of 1782‚Äì1783, with the war all but won, Stewart remained in Philadelphia while much of the Continental Army camped at Newburgh, New York. Earlier in the war, the Second Continental Congress had promised officers they would receive a life pension of half-pay beginning on October 21, 1780, but had made no effort to back up this promise. As officers and soldiers at Newburgh realized that they needed to get Congress to give them their back pay before the army was disbanded, the situation there began to develop into a crisis. In January 1783, a committee of officers drew up a petition listing the army's grievances and presented it to Congress.Boatner, 780 Washington wrote to members of Congress that the officers' claims were legitimate; nevertheless, Congress defeated a measure that would have given full pay for five years as compensation for the promised pension. Although Washington was not unsympathetic to his officers' position, he was apprehensive of the consequences of a large-scale mutiny, and notified Congress that he would do all he could to stop the army from rebelling. When Walter Stewart arrived at Newburgh, a cabal of officers enlisted him to speak with Washington and to sound him out, in the hope of bringing Washington around to their view on a matter of greater importance to them than either back pay or pensions. According to Rufus King, a majority of American officers expected that after the army was disbanded, they would be considerably worse off as civilians. Lacking wealth or family influence, they would lose their respectability, facing \\"a prospect of obscurity if not of actual misery.\\" To them, \\"their military situation was more inviting and pleasant\\" than any that they could hope for in peacetime, and accordingly, their object was at least to maintain the Continental Army as a perpetual standing army. Stewart sensed that Washington did not agree with his approach, so he turned instead to the sympathetic Horatio Gates, his former superior. According to historian Mark M. Boatner III, Stewart was the real mover behind the Newburgh Conspiracy. He warned his fellow officers that Congress planned to disband the army so that it would not have to meet their demands. He urged the other officers to stand together and force Congress to pay them immediately. Matters came to a head on March 10, 1783 with the publication of the first Newburgh Address. Gates' aide-de-camp John Armstrong Jr. has been credited with writing the address, which Gates approved in advance. Alexander Hamilton also urged the army to take action against Congress. A second address appeared on March 12, attempting to co-opt Washington into the conspiracy. Washington moved quickly to quell the impending mutiny by calling an officers' meeting on March 15. He also notified Congress that it needed to act soon on the army's grievances.Wright, 178 At the officers' meeting Washington appealed to his audience not to carry out \\"any measures which, viewed in the calm light of reason, will lessen the dignity and sully the glory you have hitherto maintained.\\" At the end of his speech he took out a letter to read. Unable to read it, he took out his spectacles and said, \\"Gentlemen, you must pardon me. I have grown gray in your service and now find myself growing blind\\".Boatner, 781 Some of his officers were reduced to tears. In a unanimous vote, the officers expressed confidence in Congress and repudiated the Newburgh Addresses. On March 22 Congress voted to adopt the compensation plan, which the officers then accepted. Armstrong tried to revive the plot in April but gave it up when someone revealed the plan to Washington, and Gates quietly dropped out of the conspiracy.Boatner, pp. 781‚Äì782 Armstrong later complained that a \\"timid wretch\\" betrayed the plan \\"to the only man from whom he was to have kept it... the Commander in Chief\\", who was not to have been consulted until later. According to historian Robert K. Wright Jr., the \\"wretch\\" to whom Armstrong referred was either Colonel John Brooks or Walter Stewart. Later career and death In 1783, Stewart finally retired from the army later with the brevet rank of brigadier general. He settled in Philadelphia across the street from George and Martha Washington and became a successful businessman and major general of the state militia. On February 4, 1784 George Washington wrote to Captain General Luis de Unzaga y Am√©zaga 'le Conciliateur' recommending to General Walter Stewart that he needed to resolve pending economic issues on the island of Cuba. On August 26, 1784 Luis de Unzaga y Am√©zaga responded to George Washington about the attention paid to General Walter Stewart and the success he had had in his efforts in Cuba Cazorla Granados, Frank, Garcia Baena, Rosa, Polo Rubio, J.

Stewart died on June 16, 1796 in that year's deadly yellow fever epidemic and was interred in the burial ground of Old St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. Family Portrait of Deborah McClenachan Stewart by Charles Willson Peale, 1782 On April 11, 1781, prior to the British surrender at Yorktown, Stewart was married to Deborah McClenachan, the 17-year-old eldest daughter of a Philadelphia businessman. Stewart's father-in-law, Blair McClenachan, was known as a founder of the First City Troop, and had bought the house known as Cliveden from Benjamin Chew in September 1779. Cliveden had been badly damaged in heavy fighting during the Battle of Germantown. Stewart and his wife had eight children, including one born in Ireland, and another in England. The children were: * William Stewart (1781‚Äì1808), died at sea * Robert Stewart (1784‚Äì1806) * Ann Mathilda Stewart (1786‚Äì1865), who married Philip Church (1778‚Äì1861), son of John Barker Church and Angelica Schuyler * Walter Stewart (1787‚Äì1807) * Henry Stewart (1788‚Äì1823) * Mary Ann Stewart (1791‚Äì1844) * Caroline Stewart, who died in infancy * Washington Stewart (1796‚Äì1826)., who was born two months after his father's death.

He reigned for 10 years (according to his extant year-names and a single copy of the Sumerian King List,Sumerian King List, MS 1686. which differs from the 20 years recorded by others.)Such as WB 444, the Weld-Blundell prism. Shu-Ilishu was preceded by I≈°bi-erra. Iddin-DagƒÅn then succeeded Shu-Ilishu. Shu-Ilishu is best known for his retrieval of the cultic idol of Nanna from the Elamites and its return to Ur. Biography Shu-Ilishu's inscriptions gave him the titles: ‚ÄúMighty Man‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúKing of Ur‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúGod of His Nation‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúBeloved of the gods Anu, Enlil, and Nanna‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúKing of the Land of Sumer and Akkad‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúBeloved of the god Enlil and the goddess Ninisina‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúLord of his Land‚Äù, but not ‚ÄúKing of Isin‚Äù (a title which was not claimed by a ruler of Isin until the later reign of Ishme-Dagan). Shu-Ilishu did, however, rebuild the walls of his capital city Isin. He was a great benefactor of Ur (beginning the restoration which was to continue through his successors Iddin-DagƒÅn and I≈°me-Dagan). Shu- Ilishu built a monumental gateway and recovered an idol representing Ur's patron deity (Nanna, god of the moon) which had been expropriated by the Elamites when they sacked the city, but whether he obtained it either through diplomacy or conflict is unknown. An inscription told of the city's resettlement: ‚ÄúHe established for him when he established in Ur the people scattered as far as An≈°an in their abode.‚Äù 4.1.2.2. The ‚ÄúLamentation over the Destruction of Ur‚Äù was composed around this time to explain the catastrophe, to call for its reconstruction and to protect the restorers from the curses attached to the ruins of the √©.dub.l√°.ma·∏´. Shu-Ilishu commemorated the fashioning of a great emblem for Nanna, an exalted throne for An, a dais for Ninisin, a magur-boat for Ninurta, and a dais for Ningal in year names for Shu-Ilishu's reign. An adab (or hymn) to NergalTablets CBS 14074, Ni 2482 and N 2833. was composed in honor of Shu-Ilishu, together with an adab of An and perhaps a 3rd addressed to himself.

The tablets are records of receipts and disbursements of the leather goods, furniture, baskets, mats, and felt goods that were manufactured along with their raw materials. A 2nd archive (a receipt of cereal and issue of bread from a bakery, possibly connected to the temple of Enlil in Nippur) included an accounting recordTablet UM 55-21-125, University Museum, Philadelphia. of expenditures of bread for the provision of the king and includes entries dated to his 2nd through 9th years which was used by Steele to determine the sequence of most of this king's year-names.

Near her 12th birthday, she was hired to work as a house maid in the home of the former President of the Lahore Bar Association, Chaudhry Naeem. After eight months of employment in Naeem's home, she was found dead with marks of torture on her body. Masih's case was brought into the limelight by the cruel and unusual circumstances of her death. The case initially garnered widespread media attention in Pakistan and around the world. Allegations of rape, torture and inhuman treatment were leveled against Naeem's family based on the original autopsy report. Naeem and his family were charged with the murder. However, they were acquitted at trial because the original autopsy report was not presented. Instead a different medical report was presented that said Shazia died of a skin disease. In addition, the police presented confusing and conflicting statements from witnesses at trial. The lack of justice for Shazia Masih highlighted the plight of Pakistan's Christian minority. Background Shazia Masih was born on May 20, 1997. Her parents were Akbar Masih and Nasreen Bibi. After her father died while she was young, her mother married her step-father, Bashir Masih, who was a sweeper. She lived in a rented room with her mother, step- father and five siblings in a slum in Samanabad, Lahore. Shazia was the third child. Due to abject poverty, her mother agreed for Shazia to work as a maid in the home of a Lahore-based wealthy lawyer, Chaudhry Naeem. Neighbors have alleged that Chaudhry Naeem's family physically beat the 12-year-old girl for petty lapses. Circumstances of Death On Friday, 22 January 2010, Shazia's step-father, Bashir Masih, received a call from Chaudhry Naeem reporting that she had fallen down the stairs. She was admitted to Jinnah Hospital. Doctors at Jinnah Hospital initially told her parents and the media that Shazia was dead on arrival, and that she may have died about four days earlier based on the state of the body. Shazia's killer had broken her jaw, ribs and right arm, and she bore signs of blunt force trauma on her sensitive parts, including kidneys, neck and forehead. There were also signs of trauma on her private parts. Bashir Masih also reported in his statement to the police that Naeem offered him PKR 30,000 to stay silent and accept Shazia's body for burial. However, he refused the money and reported the case. Trial Following a media outcry, the police arrested Chaudhry Naeem, his son Yasir, sister-in-law and daughter-in-law. They were initially charged by the police with illegally employing a minor, physical torture of a child and murder. However, soon there was an outcry from members of the Lahore Bar Association (LBA), of which Naeem had earlier served as President. The LBA alleged that the police was harassing an Advocate member of the LBA. They announced a boycott of court proceedings to protest the arrest of a member of the Bar Association. Naeem in his statement to the police alleged that Shazia was misbehaving in Naeem's home. He charged her with taking food from the family's refrigerator without permission. While the first autopsy report and statements from doctors at Jinnah Hospital alleged physical torture and abuse, a subsequent autopsy report claimed that Shazia died of cardiopulmonary arrest. A toxicology reported that Shazia died of sepsis or blood poisoning. Yet another medical report presented at trial stated that Shazia died of a skin disease. Later, the media reported that Shazia's family had been paid PKR 10,000 at the time of her employment with Chaudhry Naeem's family. After Shazia's death gathered media attention, her family was offered PKR 500,000 and a house by Naeem. Chaudhry Naeem alleged that Bashir Masih filed charges against him because Naeem had refused Bashir's request for money. He further alleged that Shazia was mentally retarded. He claimed that he wanted Bashir to take his daughter back home, but Bashir had refused. As a result, Pakistan's Human Rights Activists distanced themselves from the case. Shazia's step-father was paid PKR 500,000 in compensation before the trial and did not testify. During trial, the prosecution did not present the original autopsy report from the Jinnah Hospital. Instead a different medical report was presented which said that Shazia Masih died of a skin disease. Naeem and his family was acquitted as a result, since this report indicated that she died of natural causes. Shazia's mother and step-father separated after the trial.

The film was adapted by Robert Hardy Andrews and William Jacobs from the novel The Narrow Corner by W. Somerset Maugham.Nixon, Rob, \\"Isle of Fury\\" (article)TCM.com. Accessed: April 2, 2016 Warners had filmed the tale under its original title just three years earlier. It was directed by the prolific B movie director Frank McDonald and is one of Bogart's first leading roles. It was released on October 10, 1936. Plot The film begins by displaying a map of the Pacific Ocean and the adage: \\"There still remain far from the lanes of travel, myriads of unmarked islands, the refuge of lost men.\\" On the island of Tankana in the South Pacific, a marriage is taking place between Val Stevens (Humphrey Bogart) and Lucille Gordon (Margaret Lindsay). The ceremony is interrupted by word that a ship is sinking on an offshore reef during a storm. Val hurries through the exchange of vows, and then rushes out to rescue Captain Deever (Paul Graetz) and his passenger, Eric Blake (Donald Woods). Val, who is in charge of a pearl business, hears that the natives who dive for him refuse to enter the ocean, as two of their men never surfaced. Eric joins Val and Lucille on a pearl-fishing expedition in which Val suits up in a diving outfit in order to show the natives that there is nothing to fear about. After being submerged at the spot where the natives disappeared, he gets attacked by a giant octopus, with his line loosening from the boat. Eric jumps in the water with a knife and kills the octopus, freeing Val from its tentacles. After this, a friendship grows stronger between the men. Since first meeting Lucille after being rescued, Eric has been smitten by her beauty. Feelings of love begin to appear among them. In his speeches, Hardy (E. E. Clive) slyly seems to prod Eric to follow his feelings towards Lucille. The Doctor instructs the Captain to spy on the incipient romance. Eric rescues Val a second time when two natives attempt to steal the pearls during a hold-up in his office. Val then urges Eric to stay on the island and become his partner, but Eric, who has asked Lucille to accompany him, refuses, telling Val that he must sail on to his destination. During one of their talks while drinking highballs, the Doctor tells Eric that he knows that he is a detective who was sent to the island to capture Val who is wanted in the United States for a murder. But, Eric says that he has changed his mind, as he now feels that Val is innocent. The Captain, though, believes that Eric is the wanted fugitive and tells Val that he is going to turn him in for the reward. Val angrily dismisses the accusation, but the Captain tells Val that his wife and Eric are currently making love. Val rushes home, while the Captain steals his gun. Val abruptly confronts the two who are talking, but the Doctor enters and soothes Val's anger, and Eric confesses that he came to the island to capture Val. The Captain, while spying on the group from an open window and realizing that he has been hunting the wrong man, bursts into the room and holds Val by gunpoint. Lucille's grandfather emerges from a room and shoots the Captain dead. Lucille expresses her interest in staying with Val, and Eric leaves the island to report that the wanted fugitive is dead.

It is located on the former Naval Air Station Weeksville in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, approximately 2 miles southeast of the present day Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City. Background A north-facing aerial view of the Naval Air Station Weeksville in 1944, showing the steel LTA hangar (center) and timber LTA hangar (top left). At the beginning of World War II, Naval Air Station Lakehurst, established in 1921, was the only active lighter-than-air (LTA) naval air station operated by the US Navy. In 1940, the US Navy proposed to the US Congress the development of a lighter-than-air station program for anti- submarine patrols of the coast and harbors. This program proposed, in addition to the expansion at Lakehurst and the reestablishment of Naval Air Station Moffett Field as a naval LTA station, the construction of new stations in the Boston, Cape May, Cape Hatteras, southern Florida, southern Georgia, Louisiana, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Puget Sound, and Hitchcock near Galveston, Texas areas. The original contract included a steel hangar, long, wide and high, helium storage and service, barracks for 228 men, a power plant, landing mat, and a mobile mooring mast. In June 1941, shortly before Congress completed action on the Navy's proposed LTA program, work began at NAS Lakehurst on a project which included the construction of two airship hangars. The Second Deficiency Appropriation Bill for 1941, passed July 3, 1941, authorized the construction of 8 facilities to accommodate a total of 48 airships, as requested in 1940. Due to steel rations, a total of 17 large wooden hangars were built among 10 LTA bases. As finally developed in 1943, LTA facilities (with wooden hangars built) in addition to NAS Lakehurst (2) and NAS Moffett Field (2), included NAS South Weymouth (1), NAS Weeksville (1), NAS Glynco (2), NAS Richmond (3), NAS Houma (1), NAS Hitchcock (1), NAS Santa Ana (2) and NAS Tillamook (2). In the initial program, accommodations were provided for six airships at each station. This was later increased to twelve at seven of the stations and to eighteen at NAS Richmond as a result of an increase in the authorized strength to 200 airships. Description In September 1941, work started on what was to become the NAS South Weymouth. The pattern of projects there was followed, with little modification, at the seven new stations during the ensuing year. The construction of the Weeksville hangar, which aimed to serve the Cape Hatteras area, followed and works started in October 1941. These two stations were the only new ones begun before the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. The US Navy started the construction of the Weeksville LTA air station on August 6, 1941, which lasted until 1942. It is the only remaining steel airship hangar built during World War II and is based on the Goodyear Airdock in Akron Oh designed by Karl Arnstein. Due to steel rations, an additional hangar was built out of wood, which would in following decades become known as the world's largest wooden structure http://www.blimpinfo.com/wp- content/uploads/2012/04/NASLTAWeeksville- Comm.pdfhttp://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/32442 before its destruction by fire in 1995. NAS Weeksville was operational from 1941 to 1957. NAS Weeksville's airships played a vital role in German U-boat spotting during World War II, helping to minimize losses to East Coast shipping. However, budget cuts to the Navy's LTA program in the mid-1950s resulted in the closure of NAS Weeksville as an active naval installation in 1957. In 1959 the facility was used for design testing of communications satellites as part of NASA's Project Echo. On August 3, 1995, a welder's torch started a fire in the wooden hangar. Response from numerous area fire departments was swift but all attempts to control the blaze were unsuccessful due to the hangar's southern yellow pine construction and massive size. The wooden hangar was engulfed, and burned to the ground. The remaining steel hangar was used by several manufacturing firms following the base's decommissioning in 1957, including Westinghouse and IXL Cabinetry. In 1986, an aerostat manufacturing company, TCOM Corporation, relocated to Elizabeth City, conducting temporary operations in a former Kmart while the hangar was refurbished and eventually returned to active service once again as a manufacturing and test facility. Today, TCOM is corporately head-quartered in Columbia, Maryland, while the former NAS Weeksville site is now known as the TCOM Manufacturing, Production and Test Facility for airships and aerostats and an active airfield for lighter-than- air aircraft operations.

Coupled Pattern Learner  Semi-supervised learning approaches using a small number of labeled examples with many unlabeled examples are usually unreliable as they produce an internally consistent, but incorrect set of extractions. CPL solves this problem by simultaneously learning classifiers for many different categories and relations in the presence of an ontology defining constraints that couple the training of these classifiers. It was introduced by Andrew Carlson, Justin Betteridge, Estevam R. Hruschka Jr. and Tom M. Mitchell in 2009.  CPL overview CPL is an approach to semi-supervised learning that yields more accurate results by coupling the training of many information extractors. Basic idea behind CPL is that semi-supervised training of a single type of extractor such as ‚Äòcoach‚Äô is much more difficult than simultaneously training many extractors that cover a variety of inter-related entity and relation types. Using prior knowledge about the relationships between these different entities and relations CPL makes unlabeled data as a useful constraint during training. For e.g., ‚Äòcoach(x)‚Äô implies ‚Äòperson(x)‚Äô and ‚Äònot sport(x)‚Äô.  CPL description   Coupling of predicates  CPL primarily relies on the notion of coupling the learning of multiple functions so as to constrain the semi-supervised learning problem. CPL constrains the learned function in two ways. # Sharing among same-arity predicates according to logical relations # Relation argument type-checking  Sharing among same- arity predicates  Each predicate P in the ontology has a list of other same-arity predicates with which P is mutually exclusive. If A is mutually exclusive with predicate B, A‚Äôs positive instances and patterns become negative instances and negative patterns for B. For example, if ‚Äòcity‚Äô, having an instance ‚ÄòBoston‚Äô and a pattern ‚Äòmayor of arg1‚Äô, is mutually exclusive with ‚Äòscientist‚Äô, then ‚ÄòBoston‚Äô and ‚Äòmayor of arg1‚Äô will become a negative instance and a negative pattern respectively for ‚Äòscientist.‚Äô Further, Some categories are declared to be a subset of another category. For e.g., ‚Äòathlete‚Äô is a subset of ‚Äòperson‚Äô.  Relation argument type-checking  This is a type checking information used to couple the learning of relations and categories. For example, the arguments of the ‚ÄòceoOf‚Äô relation are declared to be of the categories ‚Äòperson‚Äô and ‚Äòcompany‚Äô. CPL does not promote a pair of noun phrases as an instance of a relation unless the two noun phrases are classified as belonging to the correct argument types.  Algorithm description  Following is a quick summary of the CPL algorithm. Input: An ontology O, and a text corpus C Output: Trusted instances/patterns for each predicate for i=1,2,...,‚àû do foreach predicate p in O do EXTRACT candidate instances/contextual patterns using recently promoted patterns/instances; FILTER candidates that violate coupling; RANK candidate instances/patterns; PROMOTE top candidates; end end = Inputs = A large corpus of Part-Of- Speech tagged sentences and an initial ontology with predefined categories, relations, mutually exclusive relationships between same-arity predicates, subset relationships between some categories, seed instances for all predicates, and seed patterns for the categories. = Candidate extraction = CPL finds new candidate instances by using newly promoted patterns to extract the noun phrases that co-occur with those patterns in the text corpus. CPL extracts, * Category Instances * Category Patterns * Relation Instances * Relation Patterns = Candidate filtering = Candidate instances and patterns are filtered to maintain high precision, and to avoid extremely specific patterns. An instance is only considered for assessment if it co- occurs with at least two promoted patterns in the text corpus, and if its co- occurrence count with all promoted patterns is at least three times greater than its co-occurrence count with negative patterns. = Candidate ranking = CPL ranks candidate instances using the number of promoted patterns that they co-occur with so that candidates that occur with more patterns are ranked higher. Patterns are ranked using an estimate of the precision of each pattern. = Candidate promotion = CPL ranks the candidates according to their assessment scores and promotes at most 100 instances and 5 patterns for each predicate. Instances and patterns are only promoted if they co-occur with at least two promoted patterns or instances, respectively.  Meta-Bootstrap Learner  Meta-Bootstrap Learner (MBL) was also proposed by the authors of CPL in. Meta-Bootstrap learner couples the training of multiple extraction techniques with a multi-view constraint, which requires the extractors to agree. It makes addition of coupling constraints on top of existing extraction algorithms, while treating them as black boxes, feasible. MBL assumes that the errors made by different extraction techniques are independent. Following is a quick summary of MBL. Input: An ontology O, a set of extractors Œµ Output: Trusted instances for each predicate for i=1,2,...,‚àû do foreach predicate p in O do foreach extractor e in Œµ do Extract new candidates for p using e with recently promoted instances; end FILTER candidates that violate mutual- exclusion or type-checking constraints; PROMOTE candidates that were extracted by all extractors; end end Subordinate algorithms used with MBL do not promote any instance on their own, they report the evidence about each candidate to MBL and MBL is responsible for promoting instances.

With eyes fixed on the blue square, the center of the circle on the right appears to be lower contrast than the circle on the left, even though they are physically identical. Visual processing abnormalities in schizophrenia are commonly found, and contribute to poor social function. There is evidence that schizophrenia affects perception of contrast and motion, control of eye movements, detection of visual contours, and recognition of faces or facial expressions. The specificity of many visual processing abnormalities in schizophrenia is still an area of active debate within the scientific community.  Perception of contrast   Contrast sensitivity  Contrast is a feature of visual stimuli that characterizes the difference in brightness between dark and light regions of an image. Perception of contrast is affected by the temporal frequency and spatial frequency properties of a stimulus, and the sensitivity to contrast in sine wave stimuli is characterized by the contrast sensitivity function. Contrast sensitivity has been shown to be impaired in schizophrenia. There is evidence that these impairments may be more severe among people with predominantly negative symptoms, or those who are not medicated. Butler and colleagues have proposed that people with schizophrenia may have a specific deficit in the magnocellular visual processing pathway, and electroencephalography (EEG) data have been presented that may support this view. Results from pharmacological studies in cats have demonstrated the role of NMDA in contrast perception of magnocellular-tuned stimuli. Application of drugs that deactivate this glutamate receptor type led to reduced neural responses in the visual system of cats, and some argue this suppression is similar to the reduced behavioral responses observed among people with schizophrenia. They claim these results are consistent with the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, which proposes that dysfunction in this neurotransmitter system leads to abnormal neural activity underlying this disorder. Skottun and colleagues dispute the magnocellular deficit theory however, saying that there is not enough evidence from different research groups to support it, and that the experiments focused on this topic have shown very mixed results.  Surround suppression  The perceived contrast of a stimulus is sometimes suppressed when another stimulus is presented surrounding it, an effect known as surround suppression (see Figure 1), which is similar to the simultaneous contrast illusion. In schizophrenia, estimations of perceived contrast in surround suppression are less suppressed than for healthy adults. Further, the magnitude of this perceptual suppression effect has been shown to correlate with the concentration of Œ≥-aminobutyric acid or GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter in visual cortex. These results may illustrate the role of GABA in mechanisms that regulate the overall level of neural activity in visual cortex, and it has been suggested that such mechanisms may be disrupted in schizophrenia. Such a disruption would be consistent with the GABA hypothesis of schizophrenia, which states that dysfunctional GABAergic inhibition may disrupt neural activity in subjects with this disorder, and this in turn may lead to visual processing abnormalities. Motion processing Motion perception is an important visual function and occurs from the earliest stages of cortical visual processing, with individual neurons being tuned to a preferred direction of motion. The cortical area MT (medial temporal cortex, also known as V5) plays a significant role in motion processing, and deactivation of this region using Transcranial magnetic stimulation can affect perception of motion. Subjects with schizophrenia have shown abnormalities in perceptual judgments of motion, speed and direction, with deficits in these judgments generally being reported. It has been suggested that these findings are related to the aforementioned magnocellular deficit purported to exist in this disorder. Inhibition of motion perception by the addition of a surround stimulus has also been examined in schizophrenia, with one group finding evidence both of impaired motion perception and weaker perceptual suppression effects in schizophrenia. This agrees with the findings mentioned previously related to weaker suppression of perceived contrast in this disorder. However, another recent report has disputed this finding, instead showing evidence consistent with stronger surround influence on motion perception in schizophrenia.  Eye movements  Eye movements are important behaviors for locating and tracking objects in the visual world. Two of the major types of eye movements are saccades and smooth pursuit. Saccades are very rapid and precise eye movements between two positions, and are important in establishing fixation. Smooth pursuit on the other hand, allows the viewer to track a moving object along its trajectory within the visual field. Deficits in eye movement behavior among people with schizophrenia have been reported since the beginning of the 20th century. Genetic factors are believed to be involved in these abnormalities, as unaffected relatives show similar dysfunction. Specifically, saccade abnormalities have been observed in this disorder, with people showing changes in saccade rate, amplitude and accuracy. Such deficits have been linked to medication with lithium, as well as to damage in frontal lobe regions. Further, people with schizophrenia often exhibit errors in smooth pursuit eye movements. The neural correlates of smooth pursuit behavior in schizophrenia have been studied using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), with abnormal activation having been observed in multiple cortical regions implicated in motion processing, such as Frontal Eye Fields and area MT. Some have speculated that errors in smooth pursuit in this disorder may depend on deficits in frontal lobe processing, such as errors in anticipating the direction of stimulus motion, and that this in turn may be consistent with working memory deficits in schizophrenia. Others have disputed this claim, presenting evidence instead pointing to the aforementioned deficits in motion processing, and abnormalities in cortical area MT as a possible source of smooth pursuit errors. In this experiment, it was found that motion perception and smooth pursuit task performance were correlated, but no relationship between measures of smooth pursuit and attention was observed.  Contour detection  Detecting visual contours, edges, or boundaries is an important function in human and computer vision which facilitates figure-ground segmentation and object recognition. Contour integration depends on a subject‚Äôs ability to link representations of separate visual stimuli into a coherent percept. Subjects with schizophrenia have been shown to perform worse than healthy adults on tasks that depend on contour integration, and these deficits may be related to factors such as illness severity, chronicity, and degree of disorganized symptoms. In these experiments, subjects often viewed stimuli that could be connected to form a coherent perception of a line, like a simplified connect the dots puzzle. It is worth noting that in general, the magnitude of visual processing abnormalities (such as abnormal contour detection performance) in schizophrenia are fairly small. Therefore, it may be necessary to examine experimental data from a large number of subjects in order to observe difference between healthy adults and those with schizophrenia using statistical methods. It has been proposed that weaker lateral excitation due to deficient NMDA-receptor functioning could disrupt neural processing, and that this might underlie problems with contour integration in schizophrenia. This idea is consistent with the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, as dysfunction in this neurotransmitter system may explain the symptoms observed. Presentation of collinear stimuli flanking a target can enhance responses to the target in cortex, an effect known as flanker or collinear facilitation, which has been shown to be weaker in those with schizophrenia than in unaffected adults or those with bipolar disorder. Publications from multiple research groups indicate that those with schizophrenia perform more poorly than healthy adults when asked to identify contours composed of separated line segments embedded in backgrounds made up of randomly oriented segments. This includes evidence from an fMRI experiment indicating abnormally reduced activation in visual areas V2-4. Another group used EEG to examine illusory contour processing deficits in schizophrenia. They found decreased amplitude and altered source location for the P1 component in patients, which they claim reflects abnormal dorsal stream processing in this disorder.  Crowding phenomenon  Crowding refers to the phenomenon where recognition of visual stimuli presented in the periphery is impaired by the presence of other nearby objects (sometimes called \\"flankers\\"). Abnormal crowding has been observed in schizophrenia, with different groups reporting stronger or weaker crowding effects.  Gaze shifts  During gaze shifts, for example when an object appears in the periphery, human usually move both their eye and head to capture the object of interest. In experiments, in which participants needed to shift their gaze to detect a visual target, people with schizophrenia exhibit abnormal eye-head coordination, and no modulation of saccadic latency (the delay between onset of the stimulus in the periphery and the start of the gaze shift) occurred, which is usually task dependent in healthy controls as they adjust to different task in terms of saccadic latency.  Perception of faces and facial emotions   Faces  Face perception is a function of the visual system which is critical for social behavior. People with schizophrenia have shown abnormalities in tasks designed to probe facial processing and recognition. Specifically, performance deficits have been observed in this disorder when subjects were asked to identify degraded pictures of faces, and the deficits observed were specific to those with predominantly disorganized symptoms. Another experiment using the same stimuli during EEG found poorer performance and slower reaction times among those with schizophrenia, as well as abnormalities in beta band activity. The authors state that these results are related to deficits in long range coordination of neural activity, as described for contour detection. Another experiment using EEG and structural MRI to examine facial processing abnormalities in schizophrenia found decreased N170 component responses, and this was correlated with decreased gray matter volumes in the fusiform gyrus. There is evidence that the fusiform face area is a visual cortical region that may be specialized for detecting faces. The authors of this study conclude that their data support a specific face processing deficit in schizophrenia. However, another study using fractured images of faces found that people with schizophrenia were better than healthy adults at identifying images of famous people that had been distorted. These experiments state that this may be evidence of weaker \\"configural\\" processing in schizophrenia, who instead may rely more on local image features for face identification, as these were preserved in their image manipulation.  Facial emotions  Recognizing emotional expressions in images of human faces is a particularly important component of face perception with clear implications in human social interactions. People with schizophrenia reportedly perform poorly compared with healthy adults when asked to identify facial emotions. Some researchers have claimed that this is not a deficit specific to facial emotion perception per se, but rather evidence of a generalized deficit or overall poorer task performance in schizophrenia. However, others have argued that a review of the literature shows evidence of an additional specific deficit in processing negative emotions, such as anger and fear, among those with schizophrenia. In addition, evidence has been presented of a link between a specific emotion processing deficit in schizophrenia and the volume of temporal lobe structures, including fusiform gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, as measured using MRI.  Visual backward masking  In visual backward masking (VBM) a briefly presented target is followed by a mask, which decreases performance on the target. VBM is a powerful experiment for schizophrenia research. It allows for control over timing at millisecond level, there are well-supported theories of the underlying mechanisms, and it can be easily studied using EEG and fMRI. Not only patients but also their unaffected siblings show strong and reproducible masking deficits, thus masking masking deficits have been suggested as an endophenotype for schizophrenia.

IMO is found naturally in some foods, as well as being manufactured commercially. Although isomaltose is found in some foods, such as honey, as a disaccharide, it behaves like all other disaccharides and is easily digested. Because of a confusion over nomenclature, such disaccharides have frequently been described as IMO, however to truly be called an \\"oligosaccharide\\" the molecules must have a degree of polymerization (DP) of three or more. Historically, the best documented source of IMO was found in sourdough breads wherein proper oligosaccharides are produced. IMO is currently produced by two distinctly different methods. One is based on a conversion of starch using enzymes. The raw material used for manufacturing IMO is starch, which is enzymatically converted into a mixture of isomaltooligosaccharides. However, IMOs produced via this method result in a very high proportion of isomaltose disaccharides (approximately 50%) and a majority of panose (IMO DP3) as the end product. These IMO preparations have been shown to be highly digestible and generally do not exhibit much if any, digestion resistance. The second method uses bacterial fermentation and bio- conversion of sugar and starch to create an IMO variant maltosyl- isomaltooligosaccharide (MIMO). Typically the end product ranges in molecular complexity from DP3 (<10%) to DP9 with an average molecular weight near DP5. MIMO preparations exhibit very good digestion resistance and also intestinal microbiota selectivity.  Chemistry  The term \\"oligosaccharide\\" encompasses carbohydrates that are larger than simple di- or tri-saccharides, but smaller than polysaccharides (greater than 10 units). Isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMO) are glucose oligomers with Œ±-D-(1,6)-linkages, including isomaltose, panose, isomaltotriose, isomaltotetraose, isomaltopentaose, nigerose, kojibiose, and higher branched oligosaccharides.PDRNS. 2001. Prebiotics. in: PDR for Nutritional Supplements (1st Ed.). Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR); Demoines, Iowa/Medical Economics Data Production Company; Montvale, New Jersey, pp. 372-375 Depending on production method, the structure of the IMO molecules can vary significantly. While human intestinal enzymes readily digest Œ±(1,4)-glycosidic bonds, longer change IMO (e.g. >= DP4) with Œ±(1,6)-linkages are not easily hydrolyzed and exhibit a digestion-resistant property. Therefore, some IMO preparations are only partially digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Isomalto-oligosaccharides are a normal part of the human diet and occur naturally in fermented foods, such as fermented sourdough breads and kimchi. The disaccharide isomaltose is also present in rice miso, soy sauce, and sake.Hondo, S. & Mochizuki, T., Free Sugars in Miso. Nipon Shokuhin Kogyo Gakkaishi 26(11), (1979) 469-472Nishino, R.; Ozawa, Y.; Yasuda, A.; Sakasai, T. 1981. [Oligosaccharides in soy sauce].

Compr Rev Food Sci Food Safety 3:73-92 Isomaltose, one of the Œ±(1,6)-linked disaccharide components of IMO, has been identified as a natural constituent of honey and although chemically related, it is not and IMO .White, J.W.; Hoban, N. 1959. Composition of honey. IV. Identification of the disaccharides. Arch Biochem Biophys 80(2):386-392 IMO is a sweet-tasting, high-density syrup which could be spray-dried into powder form. Manufacturing For manufacturing IMO on a commercial scale, food industries use starch processed from cereal crops like wheat, barley, pulses (peas, beans, lentils), oats, tapioca, rice, potato and others. This variety in sources could benefit consumers who have allergies or hypersensitivity to certain cereal crops. The manufacturing process controls the degree of polymerization (dp) and the Œ±(1,6)-linkages to ensure a consistent quality of IMO from different starch sources. The starch is first converted, by means of simple enzymatic hydrolysis, into high maltose syrup with di-, tri and oligosaccharides (2, 3 or more glucose units) having Œ±(1,4)-glycosidic linkages which are readily digestible in the human intestine. These Œ±(1,4)-glycosidic linkages are further converted into digestion-resistant Œ±(1,6)-glycosidic linkages, creating \\"iso\\" linkages between glucose moieties and forming Isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMO). The majority of oligosaccharides found in IMO consist of three to six monosaccharide (glucose) units linked together. However, disaccharides, as well as longer polysaccharides (up to nine glucose units), are also present. The disaccharide fraction of IMO consists mainly of Œ±(1,6)-linked isomaltose, while maltotriose, panose, and isomaltotriose make up the trisaccharide fraction. A mixture of isomaltotetraose, isomaltopentaose, maltohexaose, maltoheptaose, and small amounts of oligomers with 8 or more degrees of polymerization, comprise the remaining oligomers in IMO. Longer oligomers do not have 100% Œ±(1,6)-linkages; the ratio of Œ±(1,4)- to Œ±(1,6)-linkages is variable. Health claims for oligosaccharides Health claims for the various classes of oligosaccharides have been investigated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and found to be insufficiently substantiated. Therefore, health claims for oligosaccharides and prebiotics are prohibited in the European Union.EU Register of nutrition and health claims made on foods, http://ec.europa.eu/nuhclaims/ Health benefits IMO is a multifunctional molecule which exerts positive effects on human digestive health; it acts as a prebiotic, decreases flatulence [this is true for the MIMO variant, however, the literature only indicated that the enzymatically produced IMO \\"induce the least amount of gas compared to other prebiotics, which should not be confused with reducing flatulence], has a low glycemic index [this is not accurate for the enzymatically produced IMO. In fact, it has been shown that these IMO preparations behave similarly to glucose syrup with respect to blood glucose absorption], and prevents dental caries in animals.Kaneko, T.; Kohmoto, T.; Fukui, F.; Akiba, T.; Suzuki, S.; Hirao, A.; Nakatsuru, S.; Kanisawa, M. 1990.

In this respect, fermentable oligosaccharides may be considered prebiotics. The oligosaccharides in IMO mixtures are, at least partially, fermented by bacteria in the colon and may, therefore, stimulate the growth of bacterial subpopulations.Ketabi, A., Dieleman, A.

This stimulates the growth of Bifidobacteria, which compete with the enteropathogens for nutrients and epithelial adhesion sites. The beneficial effects of IMO have been found in infants, children, and the elderly. Dental caries is caused by the formation of insoluble glucan (plaque) on the surface of teeth, and the production of acids by bacteria in the plaque. These acids attack the hard tissues of the teeth. Studies with animal models showed that IMO, in place of sucrose, reduces the amount of plaque formed and also reduces the amount of enamel- attacking acids formed. Therefore, IMO acts as an anti-caries agent.Minami T, et al. (1989). Caries-inducing activity of isomaltooligosugar (IMOS) in vitro and rat experiments. Shoni Shikagaku Zasshi 27(4) 1010-7) The reported Glycemic Index (GI) for IMO is 34.66¬±7.65 (on a scale of 1‚Äì100) which represents a low GI.Sheng, G. E., Dong-lian, C. A. I. & Wan, Li-li.

Effects of isomalto-oligosaccharides on bowel functions and indicators of nutritional status in constipated elderly men. J Am Coll Nutr 20(1):44-49 The American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) defines soluble fiber as \\"the edible parts of plants or similar carbohydrates resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine with complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine\\".AACC Report, March 2001, Vol. 46, No. 3, page 112 Dietary fiber consists of many plant components including oligosaccharides. For a dietary substrate to be classified as a fiber, it must be resistant to digestion and absorption in upper GI tract, and cause a bulking effect in defecation. IMO is considered a dietary fiber for the following reasons: it consists of glucose units linked together (mostly) by digestion-resistant linkages; it has a prebiotic effect; it retains moisture, producing a bulking effect and helping to move the stool forward.Tungland, B.C.; Meyer, D. 2002. Nondigestible oligo-and polysaccharides (dietary fiber): Their physiology and role in human health and food. Compr. Rev. Food Sci. Food Safety 3:73-92 Usage IMO is finding global acceptance by food manufacturers for use in a wide range of food products, especially beverages and snack/nutrition bars. In the United States, IMO is used mostly as a source of dietary fiber. However, IMO is also used as a low calorie sweetener in a variety of foods like bakery and cereal products. Since IMO is about 50% as sweet as sucrose (sugar), it cannot replace sugar in a one-to-one ratio. However, IMO has few side effects compared to other oligosaccharides of the same class.Oku, T.; Nakamura, S., 2002. Digestion, absorption, fermentation, and metabolism of functional sugar substitutes and their available energy. Pure Appl. Chem. 74(7): 1253-1261 Therefore this carbohydrate molecule is receiving growing attention by food manufacturers across North America, as well as in Europe. Side-effects Generally, all digestion-resistant oligosaccharides, including IMO, have adverse side effects when consumed in amounts greater than permissible levels. The maximum permissible dose of IMO is 1.5 g/kg body weight, which is higher than for any other sugar substitute. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recommended a maximum consumption of 30 g/day for IMO.http://www.bioneutra.ca/_pdf/FDA-GRAS_FullNotification_0209.pdf Higher dosages (greater than 40 g/day), can cause gastrointestinal symptoms like flatulence, bloating, soft stool or diarrhea. Regulatory information IMO and other oligosaccharides have long been approved in China and Japan. In Japan, IMO is on the list of Foods for Specified Health Use (FOSHU) for more than 10 years. In 2002, over 50% of the FOSHU foods in Japan incorporated oligosaccharides as the functional component.Nakakuki, T., (2003) Development of Functional Oligosaccharides in Japan. Trends in Glycoscience and Glycotechnology 15(82): 62 & 63Yamaguchi, P. & Associates, Inc. (2004) Functional Foods & FOSHU Japan, Market & Product Report The list includes many types of foods: soft drinks and other beverages, frozen yogurt, confectionery products, sweeteners, cookies, coffee drink mixes, bread, tofu, chocolate, and soup mixes. IMO has been imported into the United States for the last few years but has never been manufactured there or formally approved by the FDA. In 2009, a Canadian-based company, BioNeutra, received FDA-GRAS and Health Canada approval for IMO.https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/GenerallyRecognizedasSafeGRAS/GRASListings/ucm154409.htm The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) recently authorized xylo‚Äêoligosaccharides (XOS) as a novel food (NF) pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/2283. Commercial availability IMO is commercially manufactured mostly in China and Japan. However, most of this product is consumed locally or exported to neighboring Asian countries. In Japan, Meiji Dairies (Meiji Food Company) is one of the biggest IMO producers. IMO is marketed under several trade names like IMO-900 and IMO-800. Being a novel food ingredient, there wasn't a producer of IMO in North America and Europe until recently when BioNeutra North America, Inc. began to manufacture this product with the VitaFiber IMO trademark.

They are simultaneously \\"voiced\\" or \\"voice acted\\" from the side of the stage by a member of the company. When Dan switches off his voice and purely signs, he is simultaneously \\"voiced\\" by a company member. The company must be four hearing actors who sign. They sit on the periphery of the stage, never leaving, throughout the play. They perform three functions: to \\"voice\\" the actors who sign, to sign the actors who speak and to step forward as the supporting players. Deaf audience member experience this play signed entirely in their language. Hearing audience members - most who know nothing about sign language - have the experience of watching the play in sign language while hearing it acted at the same time. Two languages become one.\\" - Stephen Sachs Sweet Nothing in My Ear: a Play in Two Acts  Plot  Laura is a deaf teacher. Dan is her hearing husband. Adam is their deaf son. Max is Laura's father who is deaf. Sally is Laura's mother who is deaf. Dr. Walters is a deaf therapist. Dan and Laura are a married couple who have son named Adam. At age four Adam loses his hearing, which leaves Laura and Dan deciding how to handle this situation. A decision many parents face when they have a child who is born or becomes deaf, Laura and Dan are torn on whether or not to implant their child with a Cochlear Implant. They continue to be at odds over the decision, which brings about more issues dealing with Deaf pride, Deaf culture, and ethical issues of Cochlear Implants. </>  Cast  Sweet Nothing in my Ear was originally produced by Deborah Lawlor and Jesica Korbman for The Fountain Theatre in Los Angeles, June 1997.

Jennifer studied acting intensively at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. Jennifer's obsessive curiosity about art and pop culture and the two's symbiotic relationship lead her to David LaChapelle and Berlin in 2006. She acquired sponsorship for the biggest art exhibition celebration Berlin could remember seeing. The celebration hosted 4000 people in East Berlin's Rodeo Club, a 19th-century dome building with DJ Dmitry (Deee-Lite) performing before a tower of love dolls. David had for the first time premiered inside the Helmut Newton Foundation in West Berlin. Previous to her stint in Berlin, Jennifer spent three months in Brazil with the youth in the slums, researching the sex trade, and also bringing LaChapelle's social documentary Rize to the correlating communities in Brazil. Her work in Brazil brought about incredible alliances that still continue to grow ‚Äì one being an exchange with MV Bill‚Äôs (biggest rapper and social activist from City of God in Rio) youth organization CUFA and the Los Angeles-based kids from RIZE.

His most recent works focus on early LDS history: Jacob Hamblin (2008), Profiles in Mormon Courage (2007), and Critiquing the Critics of Joseph Smith (2005). Another book on early LDS history, Edward Partridge (1998), is a biography of Wixom's great-great- grandfather, the first presiding bishop of the LDS church. In 1998 Wixom gave the annual Juanita Brooks Lecture at Dixie State College in St. George, Utah on the subject of Jacob Hamblin. In 2009 Wixom was the featured speaker at the annual Jacob Hamblin Days celebration in Kanab, Utah. Hunting and fishing books by Wixom include Fishing: The Extra Edge (2006), Personalized Fishing Guide to Utah (2001), Improve the World, Go Fishing (1999), Fishing and Hunting Guide to Utah (1990), Elk and Elk Hunting (1986), and Penny Pinching Guide to Bigger Fish and Better Hunting (1980). Wixom helped organize the first chapter of Trout Unlimited in 1965, serving as its first president. Wixom co-authored the book When Angels Intervene to Save the Children (originally entitled Trial by Terror and first published in 1987; revised and updated 1994) with his wife, Judene Wixom, on the Cokeville Elementary School hostage crisis of 1986 in which their 12-year-old son Kamron was taken hostage; CBS made the television movie To Save the Children in 1994, based on that book. In 2015 the book was retitled The Cokeville Miracle: When Angels Intervene and made into the feature film The Cokeville Miracle by filmmaker T.C. Christensen. Wixom also published a work of fiction in 1998, Benjamin Lowery and authored the written portion of the graphic arts book Utah, published in 1974. Wixom graduated in 1951 from South High School (Salt Lake City), has bachelor's and master's degrees in communications from Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah, and completed some post graduate work in history at the University of Utah. Starting his career in journalism prior to 1960, Wixom served as editor-in-chief of BYU's The Daily Universe. By 1961, The Deseret News, a daily newspaper in Salt Lake City, Utah, had hired Wixom as an outdoor sports writer. In 1970, Field & Stream magazine named Wixom their Rocky Mountain field editor, a position he held for 5 years. Wixom was the founding editor of his own Utah Outdoors magazine and served as Wyoming editor for Western Outdoors magazine from 1981-86 after moving to that state in 1981. He was also a frequent contributor to the monthly periodicals Outdoor Life and Sports Afield and served as chairman of the Fish Committee, Utah Wildlife Federation. During the 1960s and 70s, Wixom's interests in hunting and fishing brought him into contact with wildlife conservationists and environmentalists working to preserve or restore clean air and water in the American West. As he became increasingly outspoken in favor of federal regulations for clean air and water, The Deseret News named him their environmental editor, the first of its kind in the Mountain States. Wixom collaborated with actor Robert Redford in 1972 to preserve the free flow of the Provo River through central Utah.

Feminist methodologies are varied, but tend to have a few common aims or characteristics, including seeking to overcome biases in research, bringing about social change, displaying human diversity, and acknowledging the position of the researcher. Questioning normal scientific reasoning is another form of the feminist method. Each of these methods must consist of different parts including: collection of evidence, testing of theories, presentation of data, and room for rebuttals. How research is scientifically backed up affects the results. Like consciousness raising, some feminist methods affect the collective emotions of women, when things like political statistics are more of a structural result When knowledge is either constructed by experiences, or discovered, it needs to both be reliable and valid. Strong feminist supporters of this are Nancy Hartsock, Hilary Rose, and finally Sandra Harding. Feminist sociologists have made important contributions to this debate as they began to criticize positivism as a philosophical framework and, more specifically, its most acute methodological instrument‚Äîthat of quantitative methods for its practice of detached and objective scientific research and the objectification of research subjects (Graham 1983b; Reinharz 1979). More recently, feminist scholars have argued that quantitative methods are compatible with a feminist approach, so long as they are attentive to feminist theory. These methodological critiques were well placed against a backdrop of feminist scholarship struggling to find a place for alternative values within the academy. Such concerns emerged from a sense of despair and anger that knowledge, both academic and popular, was based on men's lives, male ways of thinking, and directed toward the problems articulated by men. Dorothy Smith (1974) argued that \\"sociology ... has been based on and built up within the male social universe\\". Objectivity and the construction of the Other Feminist methods have, in large part, been scaffolded as a rebuttal to existing research methods that operate under imperialist, racist, and patriarchal assumptions about the research subject. By pointing out the biased perspectives and assumptions of researchers, feminist scholars work to elucidate the ways in which the idea of objectivity has operated merely as a stand-in for the white, male perspective, and how feminist methods, in contrast, work to produce knowledge in which ‚Äúthe researcher appears to us not as an invisible, anonymous voice of authority, but as a real, historical individual with concrete, specific desires and interests.‚Äù Also inherent in the traditional researcher-subject relationship is the subject-object relationship, for the researcher becomes the autonomous subject when they study other humans as objects, as in this case the ‚Äúsubject‚Äù is ironically objectified through the process of scientific investigation, which does not take into account their agency or the will of their community. Subjects are also simultaneously ‚ÄúOthered‚Äù by Western researchers who exotify their ways of life through ‚Äúa Western discourse about the Other which is supported by ‚Äòinstitutions, vocabulary, scholarship, imagery, doctrines, even colonial bureaucracies and colonial styles.‚Äô‚Äù Reinharz therefore posits that the destruction of the Other and the remodeling of the traditional subject-object relationship must occur simultaneously through explicit engagement with three different actors in feminist research: the researcher, the reader, and the people being studied. In this way, productive, feminist methods attempt to ‚Äúdemystify‚Äù and ‚Äúdecolonize‚Äù research through recognizing how traditional methods construct the Other and are cloaked in a false objectivity, and subsequently to deconstruct these narratives in order to ‚Äútalk more creatively about research with particular groups and communities ‚Äì women, the economically oppressed, ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples.‚Äù Questioning gender as a scientific construct Through questioning science Anne Fausto-Sterling came up with alternatives to the concept of having only two sexes, male and female. She argues that through biological development there is a possibility of having five sexes instead of two. She believes there are male, female, merm (male pseudohermaphrodites, i.e. when testicular tissue is present), ferm (female pseudohermaphrodites, i.e. when ovarian tissue is present), and herm (true hermaphrodites, i.e. when both testicular and ovarian tissue is present). Emotion Alison Jaggar disputes the dichotomy between reason and emotion and argues that rationality needs emotion. She states emotions are normally associated with women and rationality is associated with men. She also claims that there are many theories as to the origins of emotions, and in the long run listening to emotions might lead to better decisions.

It was made in 1619, and the choice of worthies to include was advanced for its time, featuring Copernicus and Paracelsus as well as Protestant reformers.Christopher Hill, Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution (1980), pp. 24‚Äì5. The portraits have been attributed to the London guild painter Thomas Knight; they were taken from at least ten different sources, according to current views.M. R. A. Bullard, Talking Heads: The Bodleian Frieze, its Inspiration, Sources, Designer and Significance, Bodleian Library Record, xix/6 (April 1994), pp. 461-500 Head of Tycho Brahe from the Bodleian frieze. The frieze was painted directly onto stonework (rather than by fresco technique), and its condition deteriorated despite restoration in the 18th century. It was plastered over in 1830, and rediscovered in 1949. Background What is now the Upper Reading Room, on the top storey of the Library, was referred to by contemporaries as the \\"gallery\\". It has been suggested therefore that the initial conception was similar to a long gallery.Nicholas Tyacke, Seventeenth-century Oxford (1997), p. 152; Google Books. Nowell Myres pointed out in one of his articles on the frieze that such instructive decoration by portraits in a library or museum was well known from the Giovio Series.E. Hulshoff Pol, The First Century of Leiden University Library (1975), p. 416; Google Books. Precedents from England of the 16th century were portrait series of bishops of Chichester, and founders of Peterhouse, Cambridge.Robert Tittler, Portraits, Painters, and Publics in Provincial England, 1540-1640 (2012), p. 35; Google Books. Earlier precedents included portrait series of various groups such as, above all, saints, the Ancestors of Christ in a Tree of Jesse or other arrangement, or the Kings of France sculpted on the facade of Notre Dame. The Nine Worthies usually appeared in secular contexts. The Nine Worthies of London, proposed in 1592, cannot be said to have caught on. Later British examples include the Frieze of Parnassus (1864‚Äì72) at the base of the Albert Memorial in London, and the painted processional frieze of famous Scots in the entrance hall of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery (1898). Portrait collections in books (the book of icones) became one of the recognised genres of collecting and collation for Renaissance humanists, along with the emblem book and album amicorum.Alciato's Emblems and the Album Amicorum The literary tradition of de viris illustribus found in this way its visual expression, typically known by the Italian term uomini illustri. The Bodleian heads, as in other places, served to join knowledge of the Christian and classical traditions. Mark Hengerer (editor), Macht und Memoria: Begr√§bniskultur europ√§ischer Oberschichten in der Fr√ºhen Neuzeit (2005), p. 75; Google Books. Content and layout Map of the Bodleian Library, 1919. The frieze was painted in 1619. Its content came from Thomas Bodley (who had died in 1613) and the direction of his book collecting; but also represented the views of Thomas James, the first librarian. Theologically it portrays the Church of England as a continuation of the Catholic dissidents John Wyclif, Jan Hus, Savonarola, and Erasmus. The Protestant Reformation is strongly represented, and John Rainolds, the learned Oxford conforming Puritan, is included.Gregory D. Dodds, Exploiting Erasmus: the Erasmian legacy and religious change in early modern England (2009), p. 156; Google Books. The portrait heads are located high on the walls of the U-shaped floor, running above the windows, with paintings several feet apart spaced out by images mainly of books. There is a division by the topics on which the authors wrote, corresponding to the university disciplines of the time. The theological display is on the southern flank; the northern side's authors refer to the Faculty of Arts.Centre for Early Modern Studies. List of the heads Thomas Hearne took detailed notes of the frieze in 1725. His list and copies of inscriptions were basic to the modern restoration; one head remains unidentified. Hearne listed 200 heads (the single woman being Sappho) where in fact there are 202.Thomas Hearne, A letter, containing an account of some antiquities between Windsor and Oxford: with a list of the several pictures in the school-gallery adjoyning to the Bodlejan library. Written an. Dom. MDCCVIII. (1725), p. 36; Google Books. As found in Hearne the heads are: Sources for the heads The collection was eclectic in terms of its models, but four major sources in books for the iconography of the heads have been identified. Other books were involved, according to current scholarship, and accessible English portraits in some cases. The Pourtraits et vies des hommes illustres (Paris 1584) of Andr√© Th√©vet was used for many of the Church Fathers and medieval theologians, and some of the classical authors. The Icones virorum illustrium series of volumes of 50 (Frankfurt, from 1598) of Jean-Jacques Boissard and Theodore de Bry supplied many models for the heads of humanists. The strongly Protestant collection of Jacobus Verheiden (The Hague 1602) was a source for many of the reformers, where the engraver was Hendrik Hondius I. Other classical authors and humanists were taken from the Opus chronographicum of Pieter van Opmeer (Antwerp 1611): its posthumous edition contained woodcut illustrations in the style of portrait medals.Albert Cl√©ment, From Ciconia to Sweelinck: donum natalicium Willem Elders (1994), p. 91 note 1; Google Books. The restorers of the 1950s used some other sources from the period, including Theodore Beza's Icones (Geneva 1580), and Enrico Bacco's Effigie di tutti i re che han dominato il reame di Naoli (Naples 1602) for the head of Alphonso of Aragon. The original source for the head of St. Ephrem is not known;Abba: the tradition of Orthodoxy in the West: festschrift for Bishop Kallistos (Ware) of Diokleia (2003), p. 71; Google Books. as for other heads of Church Fathers, the restorers used the 1624 work of Raphael Custos, Patrologia, id est Descriptio S.

He also served as a member of the Wisconsin State Senate.  Early life and education Alban was born in Jefferson County, Ohio, to William and Elizabeth Alban. At age 8, his family moved to Stark County, Ohio, where he worked in farming, received a common education, and read law. Wisconsin pioneer Alban married Amanda Harris in 1833 and they had five children together. Alban moved west with his young family in 1836, first stopping near Chicago, then moving into the Wisconsin Territory, in 1838. They traveled through Dane County and stopped near the site of what is now Sauk City to watch the negotiations between the United States and the Winnebago which would ultimately lead to the Winnebago ceding all land east of the Mississippi. Before the treaty went into effect, Alban took his family across the frozen Wisconsin River into what was still Winnebago territory. On December 20, 1838, the Alban family settled in the south end of the Sauk Prairie. The Albans are considered to be the first \\"white\\" family to settle in the county, and their daughter, Elizabeth, was said to be the first \\"white\\" child born in the county. In 1839, while exploring north of his family settlement, Alban discovered Devil's Lake and reported its location to explorer Eben Peck. In the winter of 1839-1840, Alban, along with the handful of other settlers in the area, petitioned the Territorial Legislature to establish their region as a new county--Sauk. His wife, Amanda, died in 1843, and Alban brought his children back to Ohio. In 1844, however, he married his second wife, Clarissa Danforth, and moved back to the Wisconsin Territory. This time he settled at Plover, in Portage County, where he opened the first law office in the area. In 1847, he became Portage County's first District Attorney, he also served as Treasurer of the county. In 1848 he entered a partnership with Luther Hanchett, who would also marry his eldest daughter, Lucinda. Wisconsin politics In 1851, Alban was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate on the Whig Party ticket, representing the vast northeastern corner of the state in the 1852 and 1853 sessions. In the Senate, Alban sat on the Committee for Incorporations and the Committee for Education, School, and University Lands. On the latter, Alban played an important role in the establishment of Milwaukee University and Racine College. In April 1854, Alban ran for Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge against assemblymember George W. Cate, in the 7th judicial circuit, but was defeated. Alban continued his law practice and remained involved in politics. In 1856, he started publishing his own newspaper, the Plover Herald, which he used to advocate for emancipation. Civil War After the outbreak of the American Civil War, Alban received a commission as colonel of the 18th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He began raising volunteers in late 1861 and, in February 1862, the regiment was organized and trained at Camp Trowbridge, in Milwaukee. The regiment mustered into service March 15, 1862, and proceeded to Tennessee, where they joined general Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Tennessee. They arrived at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, on April 5 and were immediately deployed to the left flank of the Union line, not yet even organized into a brigade. They camped that night, and in the early morning found themselves under attack from Confederate forces on two sides. The regiment eventually was able to find a defensive position with similarly disorganized volunteer regiments from Ohio and Illinois, and were able to repel subsequent Confederate attacks. But at this place, after seven hours of battle, Colonel Alban was shot off his horse by a sharp shooter. He died the next day, one of 23,746 casualties at the Battle of Shiloh.Proceedings of the State Bar Association of Wisconsin, vol. 1, State Bar Association of Wisconsin: 1905, pp. 242-243. His second in command, Lt. Colonel Samuel Beall was also wounded in the battle, and the next in command, Major Josiah W. Crane, was killed as well. He was ultimately succeeded in his command by future U.S. Representative Gabriel Bouck, who led the regiment through the next two years of the war.  Legacy  Colonel Alban's body was returned to Plover and he was interred at Plover Cemetery. Colonel Alban was survived by nine of his ten children. His brother, William, had followed him to Wisconsin and also set down roots in Plover. The town and community of Alban, Wisconsin, in Portage County, is named for him.

The organization began as an on-site program of the Chapel Hill and Carrboro Human Rights Center under the leadership of coach John Mulholland in 2010. Originally, Coach Mulholland taught soccer lessons to children living in the Abbey Court Apartments, historically an apartment complex for low-income families. Since its beginning, Play Street Soccer has now grown to host pick- up soccer games at three low-income neighborhoods in Chapel Hill and Carrboro through the efforts of UNC student, Carey Averbook. Games are held at Abbey Court Apartments, Rogers Road, and Estes Park apartments throughout the week during the fall and spring. Volunteers from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill help facilitate the games as part of various service-learning classes offered at the institution. Play Street Soccer's mission is to bring soccer to communities where most children can't travel to club teams. In addition, the organization hopes to bring together the children and parents of each community through friendly competition.

After the Helpt Hills they are the second highest points in the latter federal state. The hills get their name from the village of Ruhn, which lies northeast of Neu Drefahl. Ruhn is abandoned today, but its foundations and gardens were still recognisable in the 1980s.  Location  The Ruhn Hills are located mainly on the Mecklenburg territory in the district of Ludwigslust-Parchim. Their eastern foothills extend into the district of Prignitz on Brandenburg soil. The ridge lies around 15 kilometres south-southeast of the town of Parchim and runs in a sickle-shape around the main village in the municipality of Marnitz and about 2 kilometres from it. On the western slopes of the ridge, which is about twelve kilometres long and only a few kilometres wide, rises the L√∂cknitz, a tributary of the River Elbe. Marnitz is the largest village by the sparsely populated hill chain and lies on the northeastern slopes of the Ruhn Hills. To the north the A 24 motorway bisects the hills. To the east is the parish of Suckow.  Geology, history and landscape  The hill chain of the Ruhner Berge, which was designated a protected area in 1994, was heaped up into a terminal moraine by glacial push during the Pomeranian stage of the Weichselian glaciation; thus it is also referred to as a push moraine. Today it is mostly covered by mixed forest. An educational path illuminates the features of nature. The wooded region of the hills is called the Marnitz Beeches (Marnitzer Buchen).  Ruhner Berg  Front and reverse side of the FF Rock (FF-Stein) on the Ruhner Berg The highest summit on the ridge of the Ruhn Hills, at , is the similarly named Ruhner Berg (\\"Ruhn Hill\\"), which is the second-highest hill in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and rises clearly above the surrounding area. The summit is accessible via a footpath.  FF Rock  Next to the official survey stone on the highest point there is also a trig point from the first triangulation survey in Mecklenburg, carried out by Friedrich Paschen. It is called the FF Rock (FF-Stein) by geodesists. The name of this rock comes from the Frederick Francis II, who gave the order for the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg State Survey (Gro√üherzoglich Mecklenburgische Landvermessung) that took place from 1853 to 1860. Cyrillic letters have been subsequently inscribed on the rock, for example, on its western face are carved the letters \\"–ì–ò–ö\\" and the year \\"1945–≥\\".  Observation tower  In June 1907 the Marnitz Veterans' and Military Society (Krieger- und Milit√§rverein Marnitz) proposed the erection of a Moltke Tower. A competition for one did not take place until 1913 however. The project was finally shelved in 1916 due to a lack of materiel and the start of the First World War; and the donations collected were given to a charity for surviving dependents of those killed in the war. Almost 20 years later a similar project was begun in earnest. In 1933 an observation tower was built on the Ruhner Berg. The wooden tower was replaced in 2000-01 by a 32 metre high brick tower. From the observation deck there is a view of the wooded countryside of the Ruhn Hills, and the vista stretches as far as the Mecklenburg Lake District, the Prignitz lowlands and the River Elbe. The tower was funded by EU donations, donations from firms in the region and private individuals as well as the surrounding parishes, whose coats of arms are displayed on metal shields inside the tower. In addition to its touristic function, the tower is also used as a mobile telephone mast.  Telecommunication tower  Since 1992 there has been a telecommunication tower on the southwest slopes of the Ruhner Berg. It is 91 metres high, made of reinforced concrete and owned by Deutsche Funkturm. (location: ).

History TimeLogic was founded in 1981 by James W. (Jim) Lindelien and developed one of the first commercial hardware- accelerated tools for bioinformatics, an FPGA-accelerated version of the Smith-Waterman algorithm. TimeLogic's DeCypher systems have expanded to provide accelerated implementations of the ubiquitous bioinformatics algorithms BLAST, Smith-Waterman, and HMMER using field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology. In 2003, TimeLogic was acquired by Active Motif, a biotechnology reagent company started by Invitrogen co-founder Joseph Fernandez. In 2008, TimeLogic formed a partnership with Biomatters to integrate Geneious Pro with the accelerated algorithms on DeCypher systems. In 2011, TimeLogic formed a partnership with Bielefeld University's Center for Biotechnology (CeBiTec) to jointly develop accelerated computational tools. Selected scientific contributions Accelerated bioinformatics algorithms have played an important role in high throughput genomics, and DeCypher systems have been widely published as an enabling technology for genomic discovery in over 180 peer-reviewed scientific research articles, including the selected milestones below: In 1997, the annotation of the first complete sequence of the E. coli K12 genome used DeCypher Smith-Waterman to determine the function of new translated sequences. In 2002, the rice genome, the first completely sequenced crop, was annotated using DeCypher FrameSearch \\"to detect and guide the correction of frameshifts caused by indels.\\" In 2004, a high throughput genomic approach to the study of horizontal gene transfer in plant- parasitic nematodes was conducted using DeCypher Tera-BLAST, Timelogic's implementation of the BLAST algorithm. In 2007, HMM profiling of metagenomics sequences generated by the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS) were performed using DeCypherHMM to discover 1700 new protein families and matches to 6000 sequences previously categorized in scientific literature as ORFans. Dr. Craig Venter credited TimeLogic in his biography, noting that the DeCypher system performed \\"an order of magnitude or two more than had been achieved before. The final computation took two weeks but would have run for well more than a century on a standard computer.\\" Also in 2007, a physical map of the soybean pathogen Fusarium virguliforme was developed using exonic fragments identified with DeCypher GeneDetective. In 2011, a global assessment of the genomic variation in cattle was conducted using DeCypher Tera-BLAST \\"to accurately detect chromosomal positions of the SNP sites.\\" Products * DeCypher Server is a high performance server with the DeCypher Similarity Search Engine FPGA-based accelerator that can be reprogrammed on the fly to run all of TimeLogic's accelerated search algorithms. * Tera-BLAST is an accelerated BLAST algorithm implementation, which includes Tera-BLASTN, Tera- BLASTP, Tera-BLASTX, Tera-TBLASTN, and Tera-TBLASTX.

It is found on beaches in northwest Europe buried in the sand on the lower shore. Description Empty shell of Donax vittatus. The shells of Donax vittatus are laterally compressed and grow to long and wide. The valves are delicate and glossy and are found in a wide range of colours including white, yellow, brown, pink and violet. The interior is white, often blotched with violet. The valves are asymmetric and wedge shaped, the anterior end being rounded and longer than the obliquely truncated posterior end. They show a fine sculpturing of transverse and longitudinal grooves and the margin is finely serrated. The annual growth rings can be seen and these are often more deeply pigmented than the rest of the shell There may also be pale radial rays. On the inside of the shell, the muscle scars are indistinct and the oval pallial sinus extends to the middle of the valve. The right valve has two cardinal, one posterior and two lateral teeth. The left valve has two cardinal teeth flanked by one lateral tooth on each side. The fringed mantle and the strong muscular foot are mauve or reddish, and the pair of short, separate siphons are orange.Donax vittatus Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2011-12-12.Banded wedge shell - Donax vittatus Marine Life Information Network. Retrieved 2011-12-12. Distribution Donax vittatus occurs in the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean, from Norway and the Baltic Sea southwards to Spain and northwest Africa. It burrows in the sand on exposed beaches from the middle shore down to the shallow sublittoral. It is common in suitable habitats round the shores of the British Isles. Biology Donax vittatus lives close to the surface of sandy beaches, extending its two siphons to the surface. When the tide is in, water is drawn in through one siphon and expelled through the other. Donax vittatus is a filter feeder and, at the same time that oxygen is being extracted from the water stream by the gills, food particles are captured and passed by cilia to the mouth. If the animal is disturbed or exposed by the scouring action of the waves, it can burrow rapidly. It does this by protruding its foot downwards, enlarging it by pumping blood into it and then using it as an anchor to pull itself deeper into the sand. Under water video-recording of Donax vittatus show that it is most active around the time of low water, when the sediment is most disturbed. Individuals were shown to \\"leap\\" and to be dragged around on the surface by wave currents before reburying themselves. At this time they are at risk of being eaten by gulls, and evidence that the birds consume large numbers of the shells is provided by the \\"gobbets\\" they sometimes leave on the beach, composed of the regurgitated inedible remnants of their meal and in which many broken shells of Donax vittatus can sometimes be found.Gulls‚Äô gobbets on Rhossili seashore Jessica's Nature Blog.

Donax vittatus is dioecious, individuals being either male or female. Spawning takes place over the course of the spring and summer. Fertilisation is external and the eggs hatch into veliger larvae which become part of the zooplankton. After about 3 weeks these develop into pediveliger larvae which settle and undergo metamorphosis. The juveniles grow fast and mature within a year.

First published in 1637, it is a tragedy about a misunderstanding which leads to the honor killing of the protagonist's wife. __TOC__ Plot summary Act 1 The play opens as the Infante Enrique falls from his horse and loses consciousness. The King, Pedro, does not wish to be detained on his journey to court at Seville, and suggests that the infante's companions, Don Arias and Don Diego, take him to a nearby country house while he continues on to Seville. Arias criticizes the king for being cruel, but Diego cautions him to watch what he says. The two noblemen carry him to the country house, which is inhabited by Don Gutierre and his wife, Do√±a Menc√≠a. Menc√≠a and her slave, Jacinta, receive them. Menc√≠a is recognized as the infante's former lover by Arias, but she cautions him to keep quiet, telling him that her honor depends on it. She sends Jacinta to fetch perfumes and is left alone with Enrique and soliloquizes about her former love for him and the need for her to suppress her emotions to protect her honor. Enrique awakens and expresses his love for her. Menc√≠a explains that she is now married and that they are in the house of her husband. Enrique, overcome by his emotions, demands that he and his companions leave at once, convinced that his fall was an omen of his impending death due to grief at his lover's marriage to another. Menc√≠a explains that she never could have married Enrique, as her status was not high enough to marry an infante. Don Gutierre, Menc√≠a's husband, enters with his lackey Coqu√≠n and asks that Enrique honor his humble dwelling (compared to the palace) by staying there while he recovers. Enrique politely declines, saying he has a pressing need to leave quickly. Gutierre inquires as to the nature of this need, so Enrique reads a story about a friend who betrayed him in a matter of the heart, intended to be a message to Menc√≠a explaining his pain at the news of her marriage. Menc√≠a uses his metaphor in the made-up story to convey that she wishes to explain herself to him. Diego returns and announces that a horse has been prepared for the infante. Gutierre offers him an exceptional mare from his own stables instead. Enrique accepts the gift and lets Menc√≠a know that he will return to visit her. He leaves, along with his two attendants and Coqu√≠n. Menc√≠a mentions her jealousy of Gutierre's former lover Leonor, and Gutierre reassures her that he no longer loves her. Menc√≠a doesn't believe him and he leaves. Jacinta enters and convinces Menc√≠a to tell her about her problems. The next scene takes place at the king's court in Seville, where he is receiving petitions from his subjects. Do√±a Leonor and her maid, In√©s, enter wearing cloaks to conceal their identities. After the king deals with several petitions, Leonor approaches him and explains that she is seeking justice on a matter of honor. The king sends everyone else away, and Leonor tells the story of how Don Gutierre courted her and proposed marriage, but broke off the engagement. She claims to have filed a lawsuit against him but lost due to favoritism towards Gutierre. She asks the king to order him to support her in a convent, which she sees as her only option as a dishonored woman. The king says that he wishes to hear Gutierre's side of the story, and suggests that she hide herself behind a screen and listen while he speaks with him. She hides and Coqu√≠n enters. The king asks who he is, and Coqu√≠n explains that he is someone who makes people laugh. The king makes a wager with him: if Coqu√≠n makes him laugh, the king will pay him 100 gold coins, but if he can't, the king will have his teeth pulled. Coqu√≠n accepts the wager, mostly out of fear of the king's wrath should he refuse. He leaves and the court, including Don Gutierre, Don Diego, Don Arias, and Infante Enrique, enters. Gutierre approaches the king, who asks about what Leonor told him earlier. Gutierre denies having actually promised marriage and the judge's favoritism during the lawsuit. He hints that there is more to the story, and the king insists that he tell him, so that Leonor will hear what he has to say and can respond to it later. Gutierre reveals that one evening he discovered an unknown man sneaking out from the balcony of Leonor's house, and felt he was no longer able to trust her. At this Leonor reveals herself and begins to explain what happened that evening, but Don Arias interrupts, saying that he feels he must be the one to explain. He says that there was another woman in the house that night, whom he had been courting with the intention of marriage, who has since died. He followed the woman into the house before Leonor could stop him, and when Gutierre approached she ordered him to flee. At the time he had thought she was married and that it was her husband returning home, so he did as she said. As he now knows the truth, he declares that he wishes to publicly defend her honor, and he and Gutierre draw their swords. This violates the law against drawing a weapon in the presence of the king, and the king orders them both arrested. Enrique decides that this will give him an opportunity to sneak off and see Menc√≠a. Everyone leaves except for Leonor, who laments the loss of her honor, and curses Gutierre for causing it. Act 2 Jacinta agrees to let Enrique into the house to see Menc√≠a, because Enrique offers her her freedom in exchange. Menc√≠a is alarmed to see him, saying that he is violating the honor of herself and her husband by coming to visit her alone, but Enrique claims that he thought her contributions to his false story about his traitorous friend was an invitation. She expresses regret for having led him on, but begs him to leave her alone so that her honor will not be destroyed. As they argue, Gutierre and Coqu√≠n return home, and Menc√≠a orders Enrique to hide in her bedroom until she can get a door open for him to escape out of. He hides, and Gutierre explains that the warden of the prison, a relative and friend, let him out temporarily to come see Menc√≠a. Menc√≠a calls Jacinta to help her prepare dinner for her husband, and they leave. Gutierre reminds Coqu√≠n that they must return to the prison before daylight. Coqu√≠n suggests that they not return, and Gutierre is infuriated at the suggestion that they betray the prison warden. As they argue, Menc√≠a calls for help, claiming to have found a thief hiding in her bedroom. Gutierre, Coqu√≠n, and Menc√≠a go to investigate, and Menc√≠a puts out the candle, allowing Jacinta to guide Enrique out of the house under the cover of darkness. Gutierre goes to search the room, and Jacinta asks her mistress why she didn't just tell Gutierre the truth. Menc√≠a reveals that she feels her husband would not have believed that she was innocent. Gutierre returns, with a dagger he has found left by Enrique hidden under his cloak. He tells Menc√≠a that they must return to the prison, and they embrace, which reveals the dagger. Alarmed, Menc√≠a asks if he has the dagger to kill her, and protests that she is innocent of any offense. Gutierre lies and says that he pulled out the dagger while he was searching the house, for protection. Menc√≠a tries to cover up her guilt by claiming that his absence makes her nervous and paranoid. Gutierre leaves, though he confesses that he has some suspicions about the way Menc√≠a is acting. The next scene occurs in Seville, where the king has just returned from making his nightly incognito rounds through the city. He and Don Diego encounter Coqu√≠n, whom the king challenges to try and win the wager. Coqu√≠n tells a joke about a eunuch with a moustache protector, but the king does not laugh. Enrique enters and asks that Don Arias be released. The king pardons both lawbreakers. He leaves, and after a conversation between Enrique and Coqu√≠n, Don Arias, Don Diego, and Don Gutierre enter. Gutierre compares the dagger that he found in Menc√≠a's bedroom with the sword that Enrique is carrying. Suspicious of her infidelity, Gutierre decides to set a trap for his wife. He returns home the following night, sneaking in through the garden. In the darkness he changes his voice so that Menc√≠a does not recognise him, and when she calls him \\"My Prince\\", Gutierre realises that Menc√≠a has been seeing Enrique at night in his absence. What he is not aware of however is that Menc√≠a is not guilty of any wrongdoing with Enrique and she tried to dismiss him when he appeared at the house. Act 3 Sure that his wife has been unfaithful to him with the Prince, Gutierre appeals to the King and informs him that his honour is in jeopardy. The King confronts Enrique, hiding Gutierre behind a wall so that he himself may hear the Prince's side of the story. When Enrique confesses he loved Menc√≠a, the King tries to get him to stop talking but he continues to incriminate himself in Gutierre's hearing. When the King attempts to hand over Enrique's dagger which Gutierre found in the house, his hand is cut accidentally in the exchange of hands. The King interprets the accident as an attack and accuses his brother of treachery. Having fled the scene, to avoid further confrontation, Enrique makes plans to leave town. However Menc√≠a fears this will arouse suspicion amongst her neighbours, the court and of course her husband, so she writes to him begging him not to leave lest her reputation be endangered. Gutierre finds the letter unfinished, with merely one ambiguous line written. More certain than ever of her infidelity, Gutierre then feels he has no choice but to become the \\"m√©dico\\" (physician/surgeon) of his own honour, and makes plans to kill Menc√≠a to restore his honour. He hires Ludovico, a bloodletter, whom he blindfolds on the way to the house so he will be unable to identify his surroundings and blame Gutierre. He threatens Ludovico's life unless he complies to kill Menc√≠a by bleeding her to death. Under protest but given no choice under fear for his life, Ludovico lets her blood. Once she has been drained of life, Gutierre takes Ludovico back out onto the street, intending to kill him anyway to tie up the final loose end. But Gutierre flees when he sees the King approaching in the street. Ludovico upon seeing the King informs him what has happened, and says he left a bloodied handprint on the door of the house so that he may identify it later. The King finds the house with the handprint, and knows it to be that of Gutierre. He admires how Gutierre has set about salvaging his honour in a discreet and private way. He decides to have Gutierre marry Leonor in order to repair her honour also, but Gutierre protests that it is too soon for him to remarry. The King overrides Gutierre's opinion, and the play ends with a dark exchange about how Gutierre has been the \\"m√©dico\\" of his honour once, and that Leonor should take heed and be careful, for he could easily do so again should he feel he has cause.

The package of this product is often a small round iron box in yellow or blue. In 2008, it won the title of Famous Trademark of China. And before that, it had already won the title of Famous Trademark of Shanghai. History In 1931, a company named FuBeiKang in Shanghai introduced the formulation from Germany, and introduced Pechoin as the first generation of skin care goods in China. In the 1930s, Pechoin acquired popularity in China and sold well in Southeast Asia, too. In the 1980s, it was not only marketed on the theme of ‚Äúprotection‚Äù, but also for the themes of ‚Äúnursing‚Äù and ‚Äúnutritious‚Äù. From 2000, other related brands were developed, and Pechoin is facing fiercer competition.

Modern digital marketing involves web pages, databases, digital TV and other forms to implement activities aimed at retaining customers through multiple channels. Pechoin's brand has existed for 87 years, so the focus of the company is on brand innovation and revitalisation strategies through digital marketing. *Pechoin builds brand awareness and creates space for the brand, and the company refuses to be labelled as aging. *Pechoin started to create series of products targeted at a different target audience and has opened new channels to differentiate consumers. *The company uses advertising to establish an emotional connection with consumers and to enhance the brand's popularity. Online strategy Digital marketing has become the company's layout strategy, and it has comprehensively reformed the five dimensions of brand, product, channel, communication and public relations. Through strategic analysis, Pechoin has positioned its brand concept in young and fashionable markets, which is more suitable for information based developments. =Platform= In terms of e-commerce, Pechoin joined the Chinese e-business platform Taobao, which has been called the \\"Chinese Amazon\\" , and started to operate its e-commerce business. Additionally, the Wangchuang Technology company is the agency that operates Pechoin's Taobao e-store. For other e-commerce platforms, Pechoin will screen different types of agent operators.

In 2017, the total sales volume reached ¬•294 million, the largest sales by a cosmetics brand on Singles' Day. =Official website= Pechoin has its own official website; in comparison to the other platforms, the only difference is that the official website has an \\"Points Redemption Shop\\". It is assumed that the consumer has registered an account on the official website, and regular purchases items from this website, which means that they will be awarded the corresponding number of points for this transaction. Hence, customers can exchange these points for Pechoin's products, which demonstrates the marketing approach that company has made to attract more customers to buy products through its own website. Projects In 2001, the company collaborated with Disney company to launch a children's care product series. The product has been qualified by the Disney company in terms of product development, technical formulation and production process.

Pechoin published advertising in image format on various digital platforms to attract the attention of the audience and increase publicity. One of these advertisements depicts the story about the assassination of women in Shanghai during wartime, and the company promotes its products through this story in order to attract the readers' attention. This advertisement reached over 30 million users on the WeChat platform, and the total number of exposures including other channels exceeded 100 million readers.

Spokesperson Throughout its 80 years history prior to 2010 Pechoin, had no plans to incorporate a spokesmodel in its marketing strategy; however, as the role of the spokesperson has increased in importance, it has been determined that the brand can improve its image in this manner. Resultantly, in 2011, to mark the occasion of the company's 80th anniversary, the famous Chinese singer Karen Joy Morris (Ëé´ÊñáËîö) was invited to promote the brand. This partnership was instrumental in launching the new young fashionable image until the termination of the contract in 2015. During the campaign, Karen Joy Morris' advertisement was shown on Hunan TV and Youku's platform. In March 2016, Pechoin announced that Jay Chou(Âë®Êù∞‰º¶) would become the new spokesperson and contracted 36 Internet beauty bloggers for promotional activities.

When Peng Liyuan visited the Women and Development Foundation on March 25, 2013, she brought three gifts, including a Pechoin cosmetic gift box. Consequently, the company's products increased in popularity, leading to many customers purchasing gift sets. At the same time, the same product series became an immediate success. Charity activities In 1996, four retirees wanted to afforest the Great Wall, and they contracted 1,200 acres of wasteland at their own expense and planted more than 140,000 trees. However, as the elderly people are too old in nowadays, they could not transport water as before. In addition, in 2007, fraudsters deceived the elders‚Äô ¬•300,000 in the name of management. Hence, elders had no economic resources to manage their trees. In July 2011, after learning about the touching stories of the elders, Pechoin cooperated with the China Youth Development Foundation immediately. On 18 August 2011, at the 80th Anniversary of the brand, Pechoin launched the ‚ÄúYongQuanxiangbao\\" public welfare activities, with the spokesperson Karen Joy Morris. Besides, Pechoin also authorised the e-commerce operations team to set up a particular public welfare group called ‚ÄúYongquanXiangbao‚Äù to help the elders achieve the green dream and launched the ‚ÄúYongquanXiangbao‚Äù series of public welfare activities.

Located on the north western tip of the Lake Tyrrell lunette along an eroded water channel, the site has revealed hearth features, stone chipping debris, and butchered faunal remains of a variety of animals, including bettong, hare-wallaby, shingle-backed lizard, emu, and freshwater mussel. The site was probably a short term, late autumn-winter camp site, occupied seasonally over multiple occupations. Lake Tyrrell is the largest playa in the Murray Basin of southeast Australia. Optical dating of sediments within the transverse dune (lunette) sediments demonstrate aspects of the lakes history into the interglacial period, and show the highest lake level around 131,000 ¬± 10,000 yr ago, forming Lake Chillingollah, a megalake filled by increased winter rainfall, that persisted until around 77,000 ¬± 4000 yr ago.Stone, Tim 2006 Last glacial cycle hydrological change at Lake Tyrrell, southeast Australia. Quaternary Research 66:176‚Äì181. The remains of repeated small scale camping episodes were uncovered during excavation in the clay lunette. Five new radiocarbon dates on charcoal were obtained from the layers containing cultural material, and ranged between ca. 32,000 calBP near the bottom and ca. 26,600 calBP near the top of the deposit. These dates were supported by both conventional radiocarbon and Optically Stimulated Luminescence dates, which were obtained independently during geomorphic investigations of Box Gully. Evidence of climatic conditions and human activity at the site suggest that people at Box Gully were adapting to severe climatic stress leading up to the Last Glacial Maximum. As conditions deteriorated further after ca. 27,000 calBP, areas such as the Willandra Lakes, Lake Tandou and the Lower Darling were much less heavily frequented than previously, and at Lake Tyrrell, the site was completely abandoned. Around the same time it appears that more sustained occupation was occurring in the Murray River valley while rockshelters in the highlands of southern Victoria were becoming frequented for the first time.Richards, Thomas, Christina Pavlides, Keryn Walshe, and Harry J.

The film is a feature-length adaptation of the 2008 short film of the same name. Excision premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Excision played in the category of Park City at Midnight. Plot Pauline is a disturbed and delusional high school student, with aspirations of a career in medicine, who goes to extremes to earn the approval of her controlling mother. Pauline has a younger sister named Grace who suffers from cystic fibrosis. Pauline has vivid dreams about herself and others being mutilated with excessive amounts of blood; and after each dream wakes panting in an orgasmic state. Pauline decides to lose her virginity to a boy named Adam. Because of her fascination with blood, she arranges their meeting while she is on her period. While having an orgasm, she imagines herself choking Adam and the bed filling with blood. She asks Adam to go down on her, which he obliges. He then runs to the bathroom disgusted by the blood, as he was unaware she was on her period. During sex education class, Pauline takes a sample of her blood and puts it under a microscope to check for STDs. Later, she sees Adam with his girlfriend. She tells Adam she doesn't have any STDs and asks his girlfriend if she has any. Pauline then tells them that if the girlfriend doesn't have anything, neither will she. Adam's girlfriend deduces that he was unfaithful. Across the street from Pauline is a teenage girl who jumps rope. Pauline invites the girl to jump rope with her, but she finds Pauline weird and refuses. Grace defends her sister and storms off. Adam's now ex-girlfriend and her friend TP Pauline's house and spray paint 'cunt' and 'whore' on it. Pauline, on an angry tirade, pushes Adam to the ground and slams his ex-girlfriend's face into her locker, resulting in her being expelled from school. While in her room she overhears her parents saying Grace's doctor wants her on the lung transplant list. During dinner, her sister has a severe coughing fit, which concerns her parents. In the morning, Pauline drugs her father with tea and ties him up. She lures the jump roping girl to the backyard and knocks her out with a chemical. She then drugs Grace after talking to her affectionately, and cuts and shaves her own hair. In the garage, Pauline cuts open both girls and commences with her surgery, moving the healthy girl's lungs into her sister and placing the other lungs on ice, then sewing them both up. Pauline's mother arrives home and sees her husband tied up. She panics, frantically screaming for Grace. She finds Pauline with the bodies. Pauline explains that it is her first surgery, and although it is messy, it is wonderful. She then urges her mother to take a closer look, who grabs her, screaming hysterically. Pauline at first seems proud, but then begins to sob, and starts screaming as well.

It developed in China from the 6th century CE onwards, becoming dominant during the Tang and Song dynasties. After the Yuan dynasty, Chan more or less fused with Pure Land Buddhism. Chan is the originating tradition of Zen Buddhism (the Japanese pronunciation of the same character, which is the most commonly used name for the school in English). Chan Buddhism spread from China south to Vietnam as Thi·ªÅn and north to Korea as Seon, and, in the 13th century, east to Japan as Japanese Zen. History The historical records required for a complete, accurate account of early Chan history no longer exist. Periodisation The history of Ch√°n in China can be divided into several periods. Zen as we know it today is the result of a long history, with many changes and contingent factors. Each period had different types of Zen, some of which remained influential while others vanished. Ferguson distinguishes three periods from the 5th century into the 13th century: # The Legendary period, from Bodhidharma in the late 5th century to the An Lushan Rebellion around 765 CE, in the middle of the Tang Dynasty. Little written information is left from this period. It is the time of the Six Patriarchs, including Bodhidharma and Huineng, and the legendary \\"split\\" between the Northern and the Southern School of Ch√°n. # The Classical period, from the end of the An Lushan Rebellion around 765 CE to the beginning of the Song Dynasty around 950 CE. This is the time of the great masters of Ch√°n, such as Mazu Daoyi and Linji Yixuan, and the creation of the y√º-l√º genre, the recordings of the sayings and teachings of these great masters. # The Literary period, from around 950 to 1250, which spans the era of the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279). In this time the gongan-collections were compiled, collections of sayings and deeds by the famous masters, appended with poetry and commentary. This genre reflects the influence of literati on the development of Ch√°n. This period idealized the previous period as the \\"golden age\\" of Ch√°n, producing the literature in which the spontaneity of the celebrated masters was portrayed. Although McRae has reservations about the division of Ch√°n-history in phases or periods, he nevertheless distinguishes four phases in the history of Ch√°n: # Proto-Ch√°n (c. 500‚Äì600) (Southern and Northern Dynasties (420 to 589) and Sui Dynasty (589‚Äì618 CE)). In this phase, Ch√°n developed in multiple locations in northern China. It was based on the practice of dhyana and is connected to the figures of Bodhidharma and Huike. Its principal text is the Two Entrances and Four Practices, attributed to Bodhidharma. #Early Ch√°n (c. 600‚Äì900) (Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907 CE)). In this phase Ch√°n took its first clear contours. Prime figures are the fifth patriarch Daman Hongren (601‚Äì674), his dharma-heir Yuquan Shenxiu (606?‚Äì706), the sixth patriarch Huineng (638‚Äì713), protagonist of the quintessential Platform Sutra, and Shenhui (670‚Äì762), whose propaganda elevated Huineng to the status of sixth patriarch. Prime factions are the Northern School, Southern School and Oxhead School. # Middle Ch√°n (c. 750‚Äì1000) (from An Lushan Rebellion (755‚Äì763) till Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907‚Äì960/979)). In this phase developed the well-known Ch√°n of the iconoclastic zen-masters. Prime figures are Mazu Daoyi (709‚Äì788), Shitou Xiqian (710‚Äì790), Linji Yixuan (died 867), and Xuefeng Yicun (822‚Äì908). Prime factions are the Hongzhou school and the Hubei faction. An important text is the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall (952), which gives a great amount of \\"encounter-stories\\", and the well-known genealogy of the Ch√°n-school. # Song Dynasty Ch√°n (c. 950‚Äì1300). In this phase Ch√°n took its definitive shape including the picture of the \\"golden age\\" of the Ch√°n of the Tang-Dynasty, and the use of koans for individual study and meditation. Prime figures are Dahui Zonggao (1089‚Äì1163) who introduced the Hua Tou practice and Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091‚Äì1157) who emphasized Shikantaza. Prime factions are the Linji school and the Caodong school. The classic koan-collections, such as the Blue Cliff Record were assembled in this period, which reflect the influence of the \\"literati\\" on the development of Ch√°n. In this phase Ch√°n is transported to Japan, and exerts a great influence on Korean Seon via Jinul. Neither Ferguson nor McRae give a periodisation for Chinese Ch√°n following the Song-dynasty, though McRae mentions :[5.] \\"at least a postclassical phase or perhaps multiple phases\\". Introduction of Buddhism in China (c. 200‚Äì500) =Sinification of Buddhism and Taoist influences= When Buddhism came to China, it was adapted to the Chinese culture and understanding. Theories about the influence of other schools in the evolution of Chan vary widely and are heavily reliant upon speculative correlation rather than on written records or histories. Some scholars have argued that Chan developed from the interaction between MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Taoism, while others insist that Chan has roots in yogic practices, specifically ', the consideration of objects, and ', total fixation of the mind. A number of other conflicting theories exist. Buddhist meditation was practiced in China centuries before the rise of Ch√°n, by people such as An Shigao (c. 148‚Äì180 CE) and his school, who translated various DhyƒÅna sutras (Ch√°n-jing, Á¶™Áµå, \\"meditation treatises\\"), which were influential early meditation texts mostly based on the Yogacara meditation teachings of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda school of Kashmir circa 1st-4th centuries CE.Deleanu, Florin (1992); Mindfulness of Breathing in the DhyƒÅna S≈´tras. Transactions of the International Conference of Orientalists in Japan (TICOJ) 37, 42-57. The five main types of meditation in the Dyana sutras are anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing); pa·π≠ik≈´lamanasikƒÅra meditation, mindfulness of the impurities of the body; loving-kindness maitrƒ´ meditation; the contemplation on the twelve links of pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda; and the contemplation on the Buddha's thirty-two Characteristics.Ven. Dr. Yuanci, A Study of the Meditation Methods in the DESM and Other Early Chinese Texts , The Buddhist Academy of China. Other important translators of meditation texts were KumƒÅrajƒ´va (334‚Äì413 CE), who translated The Sutra on the Concentration of Sitting Meditation, amongst many other texts; and Buddhabhadra. These Chinese translations of mostly Indian SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Yogacara meditation manuals were the basis for the meditation techniques of Chinese Chan.Thich Hang Dat, A REAPPRAISAL OF KUMƒÄRAJƒ™VA‚ÄôS ROLE IN MEDIEVAL CHINESE BUDDHISM: AN EXAMINATION OF KUMƒÄRAJƒ™VA‚ÄôS TRANSLATION TEXT ON ‚ÄúTHE ESSENTIAL EXPLANATION OF THE METHOD OF DHYANA‚Äù Buddhism was exposed to Confucian and Taoist influences when it came to China. Goddard quotes D.T. Suzuki, calling Chan a \\"natural evolution of Buddhism under Taoist conditions\\". Buddhism was first identified to be \\"a barbarian variant of Taoism\\", and Taoist terminology was used to express Buddhist doctrines in the oldest translations of Buddhist texts, a practice termed ko-i, \\"matching the concepts\\". The first Buddhist recruits in China were Taoists. They developed high esteem for the newly introduced Buddhist meditational techniques, and blended them with Taoist meditation. Representatives of early Chinese Buddhism like Sengzhao and Tao Sheng were deeply influenced by the Taoist keystone works of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Against this background, especially the Taoist concept of naturalness was inherited by the early Chan disciples: they equated ‚Äì to some extent ‚Äì the ineffable Tao and Buddha-nature, and thus, rather than feeling bound to the abstract \\"wisdom of the s≈´tras\\", emphasized Buddha-nature to be found in \\"everyday\\" human life, just as the Tao. Neo-Taoist concepts were taken over in Chinese Buddhism as well. Concepts such as T'i-yung (È´îÁî® Essence and Function) and Li-shih (ÁêÜ‰∫ã Noumenon and Phenomenon, or Principle and Practice) were first taken over by Hua-yen Buddhism, which consequently influenced Chan deeply. On the other hand, Taoists at first misunderstood sunyata to be akin to the Taoist non-being. The emerging Chinese Buddhism nevertheless had to compete with Taoism and Confucianism: One point of confusion for this new emerging Chinese Buddhism was the two truths doctrine. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ontological truths: reality exists on two levels, a relative level and an absolute level. Taoists at first misunderstood sunyata to be akin to the Taoist non-being. In Indian Madhyamaka philosophy the two truths are two epistemological truths: two different ways to look at reality. Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha- nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths. =Divisions of training= When Buddhism came to China, there were three divisions of training: # The training in virtue and discipline in the precepts (Skt. ≈õƒ´la), # The training in mind through meditation (Skt. dhyƒÅna) to attain a luminous and non-reactive state of mind, and # The training in the recorded teachings (Skt. Dharma). It was in this context that Buddhism entered into Chinese culture. Three types of teachers with expertise in each training practice developed: # Vinaya masters specialized in all the rules of discipline for monks and nuns, # DhyƒÅna masters specialized in the practice of meditation, and # Dharma masters specialized in mastery of the Buddhist texts. Monasteries and practice centers were created that tended to focus on either the Vinaya and training of monks or the teachings focused on one scripture or a small group of texts. DhyƒÅna (Chan) masters tended to practice in solitary hermitages, or to be associated with vinaya training monasteries or the dharma teaching centers. The later naming of the Zen school has its origins in this view of the threefold division of training. McRae goes so far as to say: Legendary or Proto-Chan (c. 500‚Äì600) =MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa and the Flower Sermon= The Chan tradition ascribes the origins of Chan in India to the Flower Sermon, the earliest source for which comes from the 14th century. It is said that Gautama Buddha gathered his disciples one day for a Dharma talk. When they gathered together, the Buddha was completely silent and some speculated that perhaps the Buddha was tired or ill. The Buddha silently held up and twirled a flower and his eyes twinkled; several of his disciples tried to interpret what this meant, though none of them were correct. One of the Buddha's disciples, MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, gazed at the flower and smiled. The Buddha then acknowledged MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa's insight by saying the following: =First six patriarchs (c. 500 - early 8th century)= Traditionally the origin of Ch√°n in China is credited to Bodhidharma, an Iranian language speaking Central Asian monk or an Indian monk.The story of his life, and of the Six Patriarchs, was constructed during the Tang Dynasty to lend credibility to the growing Ch√°n-school. Only scarce historical information is available about him, but his hagiography developed when the Chan tradition grew stronger and gained prominence in the early 8th century. By this time a lineage of the six ancestral founders of Chan in China was developed. The actual origins of Ch√°n may lie in ascetic practitioners of Buddhism, who found refuge in forests and mountains. Huike, \\"a dhuta (extreme ascetic) who schooled others\\" and used the Srimala Sutra, one of the TathƒÅgatagarbha s≈´tras , figures in the stories about Bodhidharma. Huike is regarded as the second Ch√°n patriarch, appointed by Bodhidharma to succeed him. One of Huike's students, Sengcan, to whom is ascribed the Xinxin Ming, is regarded as the third patriarch. By the late 8th century, under the influence of Huineng's student Shenhui, the traditional list of patriarchs of the Chan lineage had been established: # Bodhidharma () c. 440 ‚Äì c. 528 # Dazu Huike () 487‚Äì593 # Sengcan () ?‚Äì606 # Dayi Daoxin () 580‚Äì651 # Daman Hongren () 601‚Äì674 # Huineng () 638‚Äì713 In later writings this lineage was extended to include 28 Indian patriarchs. In the Song of Enlightenment (Ë≠âÈÅìÊ≠å Zh√®ngd√†o gƒì) of Yongjia Xuanjue (Ê∞∏ÂòâÁéÑË¶∫, 665‚Äì713), one of the chief disciples of Hu√¨n√©ng, it is written that Bodhidharma was the 28th patriarch in a line of descent from MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa, a disciple of ≈öƒÅkyamuni Buddha, and the first patriarch of Chan Buddhism. =Lankavatara Sutra= In its beginnings in China, Chan primarily referred to the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras and especially to the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra. As a result, early masters of the Chan tradition were referred to as \\"La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra masters\\". As the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra teaches the doctrine of the EkayƒÅna \\"One Vehicle\\", the early Chan school was sometimes referred to as the \\"One Vehicle School\\". In other early texts, the school that would later become known as Chan is sometimes even referred to as simply the \\"La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra school\\" (Ch. Ê•û‰ºΩÂÆó, L√©ngqi√© Z≈çng). Accounts recording the history of this early period are to be found in the Records of the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra Masters (). =Bodhidharma= Bodhidharma with Dazu Huike. Painting by Sessh≈´ T≈çy≈ç, 15th century. Bodhidharma is recorded as having come into China during the time of Southern and Northern Dynasties to teach a \\"special transmission outside scriptures\\" which \\"did not stand upon words\\". Throughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian. He is referred as \\"The Blue-Eyed Barbarian\\" (Á¢ßÁúºËÉ°:B√¨y«én h√∫) in Chinese Chan texts.Soothill, William Edward; Hodous, Lewis (1995), A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms, London: RoutledgeCurzon Only scarce historical information is available about him but his hagiography developed when the Chan tradition grew stronger and gained prominence in the early 8th century. By this time a lineage of the six ancestral founders of Ch√°n in China was developed. Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend. There are three principal sources for Bodhidharma's biography: The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang by Y√°ng Xu√†nzhƒ´'s (Ê•äË°í‰πã, 547), Tan Lin's preface to the Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices (6th century CE), and Dayi Daoxin's Further Biographies of Eminent Monks (7th century CE). These sources vary in their account of Bodhidharma being either \\"from Persia\\" (547 CE), \\"a Brahman monk from South India\\" (645 CE), \\"the third son of a Brahman king of South India\\" (c. 715 CE). Some traditions specifically describe Bodhidharma to be the third son of a Pallava king from Kanchipuram. The Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices written by Tan Lin (ÊõáÊûó; 506‚Äì574), contains teachings which are attributed to Bodhidharma. The text is known from the Dunhuang manuscripts. The two entrances to enlightenment are the entrance of principle and the entrance of practice: This text was used and studied by Huike and his students. The True Nature refers to the Buddha- nature. =Huike= Bodhidharma settled in Northern Wei China. Shortly before his death, Bodhidharma appointed his disciple Dazu Huike to succeed him, making Huike the first Chinese-born ancestral founder and the second ancestral founder of Chan in China. Bodhidharma is said to have passed three items to Huike as a sign of transmission of the Dharma: a robe, a bowl, and a copy of the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra. The transmission then passed to the second ancestral founder Dazu Huike, the third Sengcan, the fourth ancestral founder Dayi Daoxin, and the fifth ancestral founder Daman Hongren. Early Chan in Tang China (c. 600‚Äì900) =East Mountain Teachings= With the fourth patriarch, Daoxin ( 580‚Äì651), Ch√°n began to take shape as a distinct school. The link between Huike and Sengcan, and the fourth patriarch Daoxin \\"is far from clear and remains tenuous\\". With Daoxin and his successor, the fifth patriarch Hongren ( 601‚Äì674), there emerged a new style of teaching, which was inspired by the Chinese text Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana. According to John R. McRae the \\"first explicit statement of the sudden and direct approach that was to become the hallmark of Ch'an religious practice\\" is associated with the East Mountain School. It is a method named \\"Maintaining the one without wavering\\" (shou-i pu i, ÂÆà‰∏Ä‰∏çÁßª), the one being the nature of mind, which is equated with Buddha-nature. In this practice, one turns the attention from the objects of experience, to the perceiving subject itself. According to McRae, this type of meditation resembles the methods of \\"virtually all schools of Mahayana Buddhism,\\" but differs in that \\"no preparatory requirements, no moral prerequisites or preliminary exercises are given,\\" and is \\"without steps or gradations. One concentrates, understands, and is enlightened, all in one undifferentiated practice.\\" Sharf notes that the notion of \\"Mind\\" came to be criticised by radical subitists, and was replaced by \\"No Mind,\\" to avoid any reifications. A large group of students gathered at a permanent residence, and extreme ascetism became outdated. The period of Daoxin and Hongren came to be called the East Mountain Teaching, due to the location of the residence of Hongren at Huangmei. The term was used by Yuquan Shenxiu (Á•ûÁßÄ 606?‚Äì706), the most important successor to Hongren. By this time the group had grown into a matured congregation which became significant enough to be reckoned with by the ruling forces. The East Mountain community was a specialized meditation training centre. Hongren was a plain meditation teacher, who taught students of \\"various religious interests\\", including \\"practitioners of the Lotus Sutra, students of Madhyamaka philosophy, or specialists in the monastic regulations of Buddhist Vinaya\\". The school was typified by a \\"loose practice,\\" aiming to make meditation accessible to a larger audience. Shenxiu used short formulas extracted from various sutras to package the teachings, a style which is also used in the Platform Sutra. The establishment of a community in one location was a change from the wandering lives of Bodhiharma and Huike and their followers. It fitted better into the Chinese society, which highly valued community-oriented behaviour, instead of solitary practice. In 701 Shenxiu was invited to the Imperial Court by Zhou Empress Wu Zetian, who paid him due imperial reverence. The first lineage documents were produced in this period: The transition from the East Mountain to the two capitals changed the character of Chan: Members of the \\"East Mountain Teaching\\" shifted the alleged scriptural basis, realizing that the Awakening of Faith is not a sutra but a sastra, commentary, and fabricated a lineage of Lankavatara Sutra masters, as being the sutra that preluded the Awakening of Faith. =Southern School ‚Äì Huineng and Shenhui= Huineng tearing sutras According to tradition, the sixth and last ancestral founder, Huineng (ÊÉ†ËÉΩ; 638‚Äì713), was one of the giants of Chan history, and all surviving schools regard him as their ancestor.Á¶ÖÂÆóÁ†îÁ©∂‰∏ÄÁôæÂπ¥ The dramatic story of Huineng's life tells that there was a controversy over his claim to the title of patriarch. After being chosen by Hongren, the fifth ancestral founder, Huineng had to flee by night to Nanhua Temple in the south to avoid the wrath of Hongren's jealous senior disciples. Modern scholarship, however, has questioned this narrative. Historic research reveals that this story was created around the middle of the 8th century, as part of a campaign to win influence at the Imperial Court in 731 by a successor to Huineng called Shenhui. He claimed Huineng to be the successor of Hongren instead of Shenxiu, the recognized successor. A dramatic story of Huineng's life was created, as narrated in the Platform Sutra, which tells that there was a contest for the transmission of the title of patriarch. After being chosen by Hongren, the fifth patriarch, Huineng had to flee by night to Nanhua Temple in the south to avoid the wrath of Hongren's jealous senior disciples. Shenhui succeeded in his campaign, and Huineng eventually came to be regarded as the Sixth Patriarch. In 745 Shenhui was invited to take up residence in the Heze Temple in the capital, Dongdu (modern Luoyang) In 753, he fell out of grace and had to leave Dongdu to go into exile. The most prominent of the successors of Shenhui's lineage was Guifeng Zongmi. According to Zongmi, Shenhui's approach was officially sanctioned in 796, when \\"an imperial commission determined that the Southern line of Ch'an represented the orthodox transmission and established Shen-hui as the seventh patriarch, placing an inscription to that effect in the Shen-lung temple\\". Doctrinally, Shenhui's \\"Southern School\\" is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is sudden while the \\"Northern\\" or East Mountain school is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is gradual. This was a polemical exaggeration since both schools were derived from the same tradition, and the so-called Southern School incorporated many teachings of the more influential Northern School. Eventually both schools died out, but the influence of Shenhui was so immense that all later Chan schools traced their origin to Huineng, and \\"sudden enlightenment\\" became a standard doctrine of Chan. Shenhui's influence is traceable in the Platform Sutra, which gives a popular account of the story of Huineng but also reconciles the antagonism created by Shenhui. Salient is that Shenhui himself does not figure in the Platform Sutra; he was effectively written out of Chan history. The Platform Sutra also reflects the growing popularity of the Diamond S≈´tra (VajracchedikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra) in 8th- century Chinese Buddhism. Thereafter, the essential texts of the Chan school were often considered to be both the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra and the Diamond S≈´tra. The La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra, which endorses the Buddha-nature, emphasized purity of mind, which can be attained in gradations. The Diamond-sutra emphasizes sunyata, which \\"must be realized totally or not at all\\". David Kalupahana associates the later Caodong school (Japanese S≈çt≈ç, gradual) and Linji school (Japanese Rinzai school, sudden) schools with the Yogacara and Madhyamaka philosophies respectively. The same comparison has been made by McRae. The Madhyamaka school elaborated on the theme of ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ, which was set forth in the prajnaparamita sutras, to which the Diamond Sutra also belongs. The shift from the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra to the Diamond Sutra also signifies a tension between Buddha-nature teachings, which imply a transcendental reality, versus ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ, which denies such a transcendental reality. Tibetan Chan Chinese Chan Buddhist teachers such as Moheyan first went to Tibet in the eighth century during the height of the Tibetan Empire.Van Schaik, Tibetan Zen, page 1. There seems to have been disputes between them and Indian Buddhists, as exemplified by the Samye debate. Many Tibetan Chan texts have been recovered from the caves at Dunhuang, where Chan and Tantric Buddhists lived side by side and this led to religious syncretism in some cases.Sam van Schaik, Where Chan and Tantra Meet: Buddhist Syncretism in Dunhuang Chan Buddhism survived in Tibet for several centuries,Zigmond, The Lost Tradition of Tibetan Zen Dan Zigmond reviews Sam van Schaik‚Äôs The Lost Tradition of Tibetan Zen, https://tricycle.org/magazine/lost-tradition-tibetan-zen/ but had mostly been replaced by the 10th century developments in Tibetan Buddhism. According to Sam Van Schaik: > After the 'dark period', all visible influences of Chan were eliminated from > Tibetan Buddhism, and Mahayoga and Chan were carefully distinguished from > each other. This trend can already be observed in the tenth-century Lamp for > the Eyes in Contemplation by the great central Tibetan scholar Gnubs chen > Sangs rgyas ye shes.

Classical or Middle Chan ‚Äì Tang dynasty (c. 750‚Äì1000) Daoxin, Hongren, Shenxiu, Huineng and Shenhui all lived during the early Tang. The later period of the Tang Dynasty is traditionally regarded as the \\"golden age\\" of Chan. This proliferation is described in a famous saying: =An Lu-shan rebellion= The An Lushan Rebellion (755‚Äì763) led to a loss of control by the Tang dynasty, and changed the Chan scene again. Metropolitan Chan began to lose its status, while \\"other schools were arising in outlying areas controlled by warlords. These are the forerunners of the Chan we know today. Their origins are obscure; the power of Shen-hui's preaching is shown by the fact that they all trace themselves to Hui-neng.\\" =Hung-chou School= Rinzai The most important of these schools is the Hongzhou school (Ê¥™Â∑ûÂÆó) of Mazu, to which also belong Shitou, Baizhang Huaihai, Huangbo and Linji (Rinzai). Linji is also regarded as the founder of one of the Five Houses. This school developed \\"shock techniques such as shouting, beating, and using irrational retorts to startle their students into realization\\". Some of these are common today, while others are found mostly in anecdotes. It is common in many Chan traditions today for Chan teachers to have a stick with them during formal ceremonies which is a symbol of authority and which can be also used to strike on the table during a talk. These shock techniques became part of the traditional and still popular image of Chan masters displaying irrational and strange behaviour to aid their students. Part of this image was due to later misinterpretations and translation errors, such as the loud belly shout known as katsu. \\"Katsu\\" means \\"to shout\\", which has traditionally been translated as \\"yelled 'katsu'\\" ‚Äì which should mean \\"yelled a yell\\".See James D. Sellmann & Hans Julius Schneider (2003), Liberating Language in Linji and Wittgenstein. Asian Philosophy, Vol. 13, Nos. 2/3, 2003. Notes 26 and 41 A well-known story depicts Mazu practicing dhyana, but being rebuked by his teacher Nanyue Huairang, comparing seated meditation with polishing a tile. According to Faure, the criticism is not about dhyana as such, but \\"the idea of \\"becoming a Buddha\\" by means of any practice, lowered to the standing of a \\"means\\" to achieve an \\"end\\"\\". The criticism of seated dhyana reflects a change in the role and position of monks in Tang society, who \\"undertook only pious works, reciting sacred texts and remaining seated in dhyana\\". Nevertheless, seated dhyana remained an important part of the Chan tradition, also due to the influence of Guifeng Zongmi, who tried to balance dhyana and insight. The Hung-chou school has been criticised for its radical subitism. Guifeng Zongmi (Âú≠Â≥∞ ÂÆóÂØÜ) (780‚Äì841), an influential teacher-scholar and patriarch of both the Chan and the Huayan school, claimed that the Hongzhou school teaching led to a radical nondualism that denies the need for spiritual cultivation and moral discipline. While Zongmi acknowledged that the essence of Buddha-nature and its functioning in the day-to-day reality are but difference aspects of the same reality, he insisted that there is a difference. =Shitou Xiqian= Traditionally Sh√≠t√≥u Xƒ´qiƒÅn (Ch. Áü≥È†≠Â∏åÈÅ∑, c. 700 ‚Äì c.790) is seen as the other great figure of this period. In the Chan lineages he is regarded as the predecessor of the Caodong (S≈çt≈ç) school. He is also regarded as the author of the Sandokai, a poem which formed the basis for the Song of the Precious Mirror Samadhi of Dongshan Liangjie (Jp. T≈çzan Ry≈çkan) and the teaching of the Five Ranks. =The Great Persecution= During 845‚Äì846 Emperor Wuzong persecuted the Buddhist schools in China: This persecution was devastating for metropolitan Chan, but the Chan school of Ma-tsu and his likes survived, and took a leading role in the Chan of the later Tang. =Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (907‚Äì960/979)= After the fall of the Tang Dynasty, China was without effective central control during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period. China was divided into several autonomous regions. Support for Buddhism was limited to a few areas. The Hua-yen and T'ient-tai schools suffered from the changing circumstances, since they had depended on imperial support. The collapse of T'ang society also deprived the aristocratic classes of wealth and influence, which meant a further drawback for Buddhism. Shenxiu's Northern School and Henshui's Southern School didn't survive the changing circumstances. Nevertheless, Chan emerged as the dominant stream within Chinese Buddhism, but with various schools developing various emphasises in their teachings, due to the regional orientation of the period. The Fayan school, named after Fa-yen Wen-i (885‚Äì958) became the dominant school in the southern kingdoms of Nan-T'ang (Jiangxi, Chiang-hsi) and Wuyue (Che-chiang). Literary Chan ‚Äì Song dynasty (c. 960-1300) The Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period was followed by the Song Dynasty, which established a strong central government. During the Song Dynasty, Chan (Á¶™) was used by the government to strengthen its control over the country, and Chan grew to become the largest sect in Chinese Buddhism. An ideal picture of the Chan of the Tang period was produced, which served the legacy of this newly acquired status: =Five Houses of Chan= During the Song the Five Houses (Ch. ‰∫îÂÆ∂) of Chan, or five \\"schools\\", were recognized. These were not originally regarded as \\"schools\\" or \\"sects\\", but based on the various Chan- genealogies. Historically they have come to be understood as \\"schools\\". The Five Houses of Chan are: * Guiyang school (ÊΩô‰ª∞ÂÆó), named after masters Guishan Lingyou (771‚Äì854) and Yangshan Huiji (813‚Äì890), dharma-descendants of Mazu Daoyi; * Linji school (Ëá®ÊøüÂÆó), named after master Linji Yixuan (died 866), whose lineage came to be traced to Mazu, establishing him as the archetypal iconoclastic Chan-master; * Caodong school (ÊõπÊ¥ûÂÆó), named after masters Dongshan Liangjie (807‚Äì869) and Caoshan Benji (840‚Äì901); * Yunmen school (Èõ≤ÈñÄÂÆó), named after master Yunmen Wenyan (died 949), a student of Xuefeng Yicun (822‚Äì908), whose lineage was traced to Shitou Xiqian: * Fayan school (Ê≥ïÁúºÂÆó), named after master Fayan Wenyi (885‚Äì958), a \\"grand-student\\" of Xuefeng Yicun. =Rise of the Linji-school= The Linji-school became the dominant school within Chan, due to support from literati and the court. Before the Song Dynasty, the Linji-school is rather obscure, and very little is known about its early history. The first mention of Linji is in the Zutang ji, compiled in 952, 86 years after Linji's death. But the Zutang ji pictures the Xuefeng Yicun lineage as heir to the legacy of Mazu and the Hongzhou-school. According to Welter, the real founder of the Linji-school was Shoushan (or Baoying) Shengnian (È¶ñÂ±±ÁúÅÂøµ) (926‚Äì993), a fourth generation dharma-heir of Linji. The Tiansheng Guangdeng lu (Â§©ËÅñÂª£ÁáàÈåÑ), \\"Tiansheng Era Expanded Lamp Record\\", compiled by the official Li Zunxu (ÊùéÈÅµÂãó) (988‚Äì1038) confirms the status of Shoushan Shengnian, but also pictures Linji as a major Chan patriarch and heir to the Mazu, displacing the prominence of the Fayan-lineage. It also established the slogan of \\"a special transmission outside the teaching\\", supporting the Linji- school claim of \\"Chan as separate from and superior to all other Buddhist teachings\\". =Dahui Zonggao= Over the course of Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279), the Guiyang, Fayan, and Yunmen schools were gradually absorbed into the Linji. Song Chan was dominated by the Linji school of Dahui Zonggao, which in turn became strongly affiliated to the Imperial Court: The Gozan system was a system of state-controlled temples, which were established by the Song government in all provinces. =Koan-system= The teaching styles and words of the classical masters were recorded in the so-called \\"encounter dialogues\\". Snippets of these encounter dialogues were collected in texts as the Blue Cliff Record (1125) of Yuanwu, The Gateless Gate (1228) of Wumen, both of the Linji lineage, and the Book of Equanimity (1223) by Wansong Xingxiu of the Caodong lineage. These texts became classic g≈çng'√†n cases, together with verse and prose commentaries, which crystallized into the systematized g≈çng'√†n (koan) practice. According to Miura and Sasaki, \\"[I]t was during the lifetime of Y√ºan-wu's successor, Dahui Zonggao (Â§ßÊÖßÂÆóÊù≤; 1089‚Äì1163) that Koan Chan entered its determinative stage.\\" G≈çng'√†n practice was prevalent in the Linji school, to which Yuanwu and Dahui belonged, but it was also employed on a more limited basis by the Caodong school. The recorded encounter dialogues, and the koan collections which derived from this genre, mark a shift from solitary practice to interaction between master and student: This mutual enquiry of the meaning of the encounters of masters and students of the past gave students a role model: There were dangers involved in such a literary approach, such as fixing specific meanings to the cases. Dahui Zonggao is even said to have burned the woodblocks of the Blue Cliff Record, for the hindrance it had become to study of Chan by his students =Silent illumination= The Caodong was the other school to survive into the Song period. Its main protagonist was Hung-chih Cheng-chueh, a contemporary of Dahui Zonggao. It put emphasis on \\"silent illumination\\", or \\"just sitting\\". This approach was attacked by Dahui as being mere passivity, and lacking emphasis on gaining insight into one's true nature. Cheng-chueh in his turn criticized the emphasis on koan study. Post-classical Chan (c. 1300‚Äìpresent) =Yuan Dynasty (1279‚Äì1368)= The Yuan dynasty was the empire established by Kublai Khan, the leader of the Borjigin clan, after the Mongol Empire conquered the Jin dynasty (1115‚Äì1234) and the Southern Song Dynasty. Chan began to be mixed with Pure Land Buddhism as in the teachings of Zhongfeng Mingben (1263‚Äì1323). =Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644)= Chan Buddhism enjoyed something of a revival in the Ming dynasty, with teachers such as Hanshan Deqing (ÊÜ®Â±±Âæ∑Ê∏Ö), who wrote and taught extensively on both Chan and Pure Land Buddhism; Miyun Yuanwu (ÂØÜÈõ≤ÂúìÊÇü), who came to be seen posthumously as the first patriarch of the ≈åbaku school of Zen; and as Yunqi Zhuhong (Èõ≤Ê£≤Á•©ÂÆè) and Ouyi Zhixu (ËïÖÁõäÊô∫Êó≠). Chan was taught alongside Pure Land Buddhism in many monasteries. In time much of the distinction between them was lost, and many masters taught both Chan and Pure Land. With the downfall of the Ming, several Chan masters fled to Japan, founding the ≈åbaku school. =Qing Dynasty (1644‚Äì1912)= In the beginning of the Qing dynasty, Chan was \\"reinvented\\", by the \\"revival of beating and shouting practices\\" by Miyun Yuanwu (1566‚Äì1642), and the publication of the Wudeng yantong (\\"The strict transmission of the five Chan schools\\") by Feiyin Tongrong's (1593‚Äì1662), a dharma heir of Miyun Yuanwu. The book placed self-proclaimed Chan monks without proper Dharma transmission in the category of \\"lineage unknown\\" (sifa weixiang), thereby excluding several prominent Caodong monks. Modernisation =19th century (late Qing Dynasty)= Around 1900, Buddhists from other Asian countries showed a growing interest in Chinese Buddhism. Anagarika Dharmapala visited Shaghai in 1893,Lewis Hodus (1923), Buddhism and Buddhists in China. Chapter IX: Present-Day Buddhism intending \\"to make a tour of China, to arouse the Chinese Buddhists to send missionaries to India to restore Buddhism there, and then to start a propaganda throughout the whole world\\", but eventually limiting his stay to Shanghai. Japanese Buddhist missionaries were active in China in the beginning of the 20th century. =Republic of China (1912‚Äì1949) ‚Äì First Buddhist Revival= Traditional Chan Buddhist Grand Master Wei Chueh in Taiwan, sitting in meditation. The modernisation of China led to the end of the Chinese Empire, and the installation of the Republic of China, which lasted on the mainland until the Communist Revolution and the installation of the People's Republic of China in 1949. After further centuries of decline during the Qing, Chan was revived again in the early 20th century by Hsu Yun (ËôõÈõ≤), a well-known figure of 20th-century Chinese Buddhism. Many Chan teachers today trace their lineage to Hsu Yun, including Sheng Yen (ËÅñÂö¥) and Hsuan Hua (ÂÆ£Âåñ), who have propagated Chan in the West where it has grown steadily through the 20th and 21st century. The Buddhist reformist Taixu propagated a Chan-influenced humanistic Buddhism, which is endorsed by Jing Hui, former abbott of Bailin Monastery. Until 1949, monasteries were built in the Southeast Asian countries, for example by monks of Guanghua Monastery, to spread Chinese Buddhism. Presently, Guanghua Monastery has seven branches in the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia.Voice of Longquan, Guanghua Monastery =People's Republic of China (1949‚Äìpresent) ‚Äì Second Buddhist Revival= Chan was repressed in China during the recent modern era in the early periods of the People's Republic, but subsequently had been re-asserting itself on the mainland, and has a significant following in Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as among Overseas Chinese. Since the Chinese economic reform of the 1970s, a new revival of Chinese Buddhism is going on.Mitch Moxley (2010), Buddhism Enjoys A RevivalErica B. Mitchell (201), A Revival of Buddhism? Ancient Buddhist temples, such as Bailin Monastery and Guanghua Monastery have been refurbished. Bailin Monastery was ruined long before 1949. In 1988, Jing Hui was persuaded to take over the Hebei Buddhist Association, and start rebuilding the Monastery. Jing Hui is a student and dharma successorThe Dharma Lineage of my Master: Grand Master Jing Hui, Abbot of Bai-lin (Cypress Forest) of Hsu Yun, but has also adopted the Humanistic Buddhism of Taixu. Guanghua Monastery was restored beginning in 1979, when a six-year restoration program began under the supervision of then 70-year-old Venerable Master Yuanzhou (ÂúÜÊãôËÄÅÊ≥ïÂ∏à). In 1983 the temple became one of the Chinese Buddhism Regional Temples (Ê±âÊóèÂú∞Âå∫ÂÖ®ÂõΩÈáçÁÇπÂØ∫Èô¢) whilst 36-year-old Master Yiran (ÊØÖÁÑ∂Ê≥ïÂ∏´) became abbot. The same year, Venerable Master Yuanzhou funded the establishment of the new Fujian Buddhism Academy (Á¶èÂª∫‰ΩõÂ≠¶Èô¢) on the site. =Taiwan= Several Chinese Buddhist teachers left China during the Communist Revolution, and settled in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Sheng Yen (1930‚Äì2009) was the founder of the Dharma Drum Mountain, a Buddhist organization based in Taiwan. During his time in Taiwan, Sheng Yen was well known as one of the progressive Buddhist teachers who sought to teach Buddhism in a modern and Western-influenced world. As such, Sheng yen published over 30 Chan texts in English.https://chancenter.org/chanctr/ddp/channews/02-1995.htmlhttps://chancenter.org/cmc/wp- content/uploads/2010/09/MindDharma1.pdf Wei Chueh (1928‚Äì2016) was born in Sichuan, China, and ordained in Taiwan. In 1982, he founded Lin Quan Temple in Taipei County and became known for his teaching on Ch'an practices by offering many lectures and seven-day Ch'an retreats. His order is called Chung Tai Shan. Two additional traditions emerged in the 1960s, based their teaching on Ch'an practices. Cheng Yen (born 1937), a Buddhist nun, founded the Tzu Chi Foundation as a charity organization with Buddhist origins on 14 May 1966 in Hualien, Taiwan. She was inspired by her master and mentor, the late Venerable Master Yin Shun (Âç∞È†ÜÂ∞éÂ∏´, Y√¨n Sh√πn d«éoshƒ´) a proponent of Humanistic Buddhism, who exhorted her to \\"work for Buddhism and for all sentient beings\\". The organisation began with a motto of \\"instructing the rich and saving the poor\\" as a group of thirty housewives who donated a small amount of money each day to care for needy families. Hsing Yun (born 1927), founded the Fo Guang Shan an international Chinese Buddhist new religious movement based in Taiwan in 1967. The order promotes Humanistic Buddhism. Fo Guang Shan also calls itself the International Buddhist Progress Society. The headquarters of Fo Guang Shan, located in Dashu District, Kaohsiung, is the largest Buddhist monastery in Taiwan. Hsing Yun's stated position within Fo Guang Shan is that it is an \\"amalgam of all Eight Schools of Chinese Buddhism\\" (), including Chan. Fo Guang Shan is the most comprehensive of the major Buddhist organizations of Taiwan, focusing extensively on both social works and religious engagement. In Taiwan, these four masters are popularly referred to as the \\"Four Heavenly Kings\\" of Taiwanese Buddhism, with their respective organizations Dharma Drum Mountain, Chung Tai Shan, Tzu Chi, and Fo Guang Shan being referred to as the \\"Four Great Mountains\\". Spread of Chan Buddhism in Asia Thi·ªÅn in Vietnam According to traditional accounts of Vietnam, in 580 an Indian monk named Vinƒ´taruci () travelled to Vietnam after completing his studies with Sengcan, the third patriarch of Chinese Chan. This, then, would be the first appearance of Thi·ªÅn Buddhism. Other early Thi·ªÅn schools included that of Wu Yantong (), which was associated with the teachings of Mazu Daoyi, and the Th·∫£o ƒê∆∞·ªùng (Caodong), which incorporated nianfo chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks. Seon in Korea Seon was gradually transmitted into Korea during the late Silla period (7th through 9th centuries) as Korean monks of predominantly Hwaeom () and East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra () background began to travel to China to learn the newly developing tradition. Seon received its most significant impetus and consolidation from the Goryeo monk Jinul (Áü•Ë®•) (1158‚Äì1210), who established a reform movement and introduced k≈çan practice to Korea. Jinul established the Songgwangsa (ÊùæÂª£ÂØ∫) as a new center of pure practice. Zen in Japan Zen was not introduced as a separate school in Japan until the 12th century when Eisai traveled to China and returned to establish a Linji lineage, which is known in Japan as the Rinzai. In 1215, D≈çgen, a younger contemporary of Eisai's, journeyed to China himself, where he became a disciple of the Caodong master Rujing. After his return, D≈çgen established the S≈çt≈ç school, the Japanese branch of Caodong. The schools of Zen that currently exist in Japan are the S≈çt≈ç, Rinzai and ≈åbaku. Of these, S≈çt≈ç is the largest and ≈åbaku the smallest. Rinzai is itself divided into several subschools based on temple affiliation, including My≈çshin-ji, Nanzen- ji, Tenry≈´-ji, Daitoku-ji, and T≈çfuku-ji. Chan in Indonesia In the 20th century, during the First Buddhist revival, missionaries were sent to Indonesia and Malaysia. Ashin Jinarakkhita, who played a central role in the revival of Indonesian Buddhism, received ordination as a Chan ≈õrƒÅma·πáera on July 29, 1953Ven. Ditthisampanno, Buddhism in Indonesia, Past and Present and received the name Ti Zheng (Te Cheng) from bhik·π£u Ben Qing. Chan in the Western world Chan has become especially popular in its Japanese form. Although it is difficult to trace when the West first became aware of Chan as a distinct form of Buddhism, the visit of Soyen Shaku, a Japanese Zen monk, to Chicago during the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions is often pointed to as an event that enhanced its profile in the Western world. It was during the late 1950s and the early 1960s that the number of Westerners pursuing a serious interest in Zen, other than the descendants of Asian immigrants, reached a significant level. Western Chan lineages Covering over 480 acres of land and located in Talmage, California, the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas was founded by Hsuan Hua. The first Chinese master to teach Westerners in North America was Hsuan Hua, who taught Chan and other traditions of Chinese Buddhism in San Francisco during the early 1960s. He went on to found the City Of Ten Thousand Buddhas, a monastery and retreat center located on a 237-acre (959,000 m¬≤) property near Ukiah, California, founding the Dharma Realm Buddhist Association. Another Chinese Chan teacher with a Western following was Sheng Yen, a master trained in both the Caodong and Linji schools. He first visited the United States in 1978 under the sponsorship of the Buddhist Association of the United States, and subsequently founded the CMC Chan Meditation Center in Queens, New York and the Dharma Drum Retreat Center in Pine Bush, New York.Dharma Drum Mountain. Who Is Master Sheng-yen. New religious movements Fo Guang Shan is a Taiwan-based new religious movement with branches worldwide. It belongs to the Chan school; its founder, Hsing Yun, is a Linji lineage holder. Doctrinal background Though Zen- narrative states that it is a \\"special transmission outside scriptures\\" which \\"did not stand upon words\\", Zen does have a rich doctrinal background. Polarities Classical Chinese Chan is characterised by a set of polarities: absolute-relative, Buddha-nature ‚Äì sunyata, sudden and gradual enlightenment, esoteric and exoteric transmission. =Absolute-relative= The Prajnaparamita sutras and Madhyamaka emphasize the non-duality of form and emptiness: \\"form is emptiness, emptiness is form\\", as the Heart sutra says. This was understood to mean that ultimate reality is not a transcendental realm, but equal to the daily world of relative reality. This idea fitted into the Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not fully explain how the absolute is present in the relative world. This question is answered in such schemata as the Five Ranks of Tozan, the Ten Bulls (\\"the Oxherding Pictures\\"), and Hakuin's Four ways of knowing. The Madhyamaka two truths doctrine and the Yogacara three natures and Trikaya doctrines also give depictions of the interplay between the absolute and the relative. =Buddha-nature and ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ= When Buddhism was introduced in China it was understood in native terms. Various sects struggled to attain an understanding of the Indian texts. The TathƒÅgatagarbha s≈´tras and the idea of the Buddha-nature were endorsed because of the perceived similarities with the Tao, which was understood as a transcendental reality underlying the world of appearances. ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ at first was understood as pointing to the Taoist wu. The doctrine of the Buddha-nature asserts that all sentient beings have Buddha- nature (Skt. BuddhadhƒÅtu, \\"Buddha Element\\", \\"Buddha-Principle\\"), the element from which awakening springs. The TathƒÅgatagarbha sutras state that every living being has the potential to realize awakening. Hence Buddhism offers salvation to every-one, not only to monks or those who have freed themselves almost completely from karma in previous lives. The Yogacara theory of the Eight Consciousnesses explains how sensory input and the mind create the world we experience, and obscure the alaya-jnana, which is equated to the Buddha- nature. When this potential is realized, and the defilements have been eliminated, the Buddha-nature manifests as the Dharmakaya, the absolute reality which pervades everything in the world. In this way, it is also the primordial reality from which phenomenal reality springs. When this understanding is idealized, it becomes a transcendental reality beneath the world of appearances. Sunyata points to the \\"emptiness\\" or no-\\"thing\\"-ness of all \\"things\\". Though we perceive a world of concrete and discrete objects, designated by names, on close analysis the \\"thingness\\" dissolves, leaving them \\"empty\\" of inherent existence. The Heart sutra, a text from the praj√±aparamita sutras, articulates this in the following saying in which the five skandhas are said to be \\"empty\\": Yogacara explains this \\"emptiness\\" in an analysis of the way we perceive \\"things\\". Everything we conceive of is the result of the working of the five skandhas‚Äîresults of perception, feeling, volition, and discrimination. The five skandhas together compose consciousness. The \\"things\\" we are conscious of are \\"mere concepts\\", not noumenon. It took Chinese Buddhism several centuries to recognize that ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ is not identical to \\"wu\\", nor does Buddhism postulate a permanent soul. The influence of those various doctrinal and textual backgrounds is still discernible in Zen. Zen teachers still refer to Buddha-nature, but the Zen tradition also emphasizes that Buddha-nature is ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ, the absence of an independent and substantial self. =Sudden and gradual enlightenment= Avalokite≈õvara sitting in meditation In Zen Buddhism two main views on the way to enlightenment are discernible, namely sudden and gradual enlightenment. Early Chan recognized the \\"transcendence of the body and mind\\", followed by \\"non-defilement [of] knowledge and perception\\", or sudden insight into the true nature (ji√†nx√¨ng) followed by gradual purification of intentions. In the 8th century Chan history was effectively refashioned by Shenhui, who created a dichotomy between the so-called East Mountain Teaching or \\"Northern School\\", led by Yuquan Shenxiu, and his own line of teaching, which he called the \\"Southern school\\". Shenhui placed Huineng into prominence as the sixth Chan-patriarch, and emphasized sudden enlightenment, as opposed to the concurrent Northern School's alleged gradual enlightenment. According to the sudden enlightenment propagated by Shenhui, insight into true nature is sudden; thereafter there can be no misunderstanding anymore about this true nature. In the Platform Sutra, the dichotomy between sudden and gradual is reconciled. Guifeng Zongmi, fifth-generation successor to Shenhui, also softened the edge between sudden and gradual. In his analysis, sudden awakening points to seeing into one's true nature, but is to be followed by a gradual cultivation to attain Buddhahood. This gradual cultivation is also recognized by Dongshan Liangjie (Japanese T≈çzan), who described the five ranks of enlightenment.The Five Ranks of Tozan =Esoteric and exoteric transmission= According to Borup the emphasis on 'mind to mind transmission' is a form of esoteric transmission, in which \\"the tradition and the enlightened mind is transmitted face to face\\". Metaphorically this can be described as the transmission from a flame from one candle to another candle, or the transmission from one vein to another. In exoteric transmission requires \\"direct access to the teaching through a personal discovery of one's self. This type of transmission and identification is symbolized by the discovery of a shining lantern, or a mirror.\\" Chan scripture Chan is deeply rooted in the teachings and doctrines of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. What the Chan tradition emphasizes is that enlightenment of the Buddha came not through intellectual reasoning, but rather through self- realization in Dharma practice and meditation. Therefore, it is held that it is primarily through Dharma practice and meditation that others may attain enlightenment and become Buddhas as well. A review of the early historical documents and literature of early Chan masters clearly reveals that they were all well versed in numerous MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhist s≈´tras. For example, in the Platform S≈´tra of the Sixth Patriarch, Huineng cites and explains the Diamond S≈´tra, the Lotus S≈´tra (Saddharma Pu·πá·∏çarƒ´ka S≈´tra), the Vimalakƒ´rti Nirde≈õa S≈´tra, the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra, and the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra. The Chan school had to develop a doctrinal tradition of its own to establish its position. Subsequently, the Chan tradition produced a rich corpus of written literature which has become a part of its practice and teaching. Among the earliest and most widely studied of the specifically Chan texts, dating to at least the 9th century CE, is the Platform S≈´tra of the Sixth Patriarch, attributed to Huineng. The most important Chan texts belong to the \\"encounter dialogue\\" genre, which developed into various collections of k≈çans. Teaching and practice :See also Zen practice Bodhisattva ideal As a school of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism, Chan draws many of its basic driving concepts from that tradition, such as the Bodhisattva ideal. Karu·πáƒÅ is the counterpart of prajna. Avalokite≈õvara embodies the striving for Karuna, compassion. Central to Chan practice is dhyana or meditation. In the Lin-ji (Rinzai) school this is supplemented with koan study. Chan meditation In meditation practice, the Chan tradition holds that the very notions of doctrine and teachings create various other notions and appearances (Skt. sa·πÉj√±ƒÅ; Ch. Áõ∏, xiƒÅng) that obscure the transcendent wisdom of each being's Buddha-nature. Thus, Chan encourages its practitioners to distrust the very scripture or text being taught to them. The process of rediscovery goes under various terms such as \\"introspection\\", \\"a backward step\\", \\"turning-about\\" or \\"turning the eye inward\\". =Sitting meditation= Sitting meditation is called zu√≤ch√°n (ÂùêÁ¶Ö), zazen in Japanese, both simply meaning \\"sitting dhyƒÅna\\". During this sitting meditation, practitioners usually assume a position such as the lotus position, half-lotus, Burmese, or seiza postures. To regulate the mind, awareness is directed towards counting or watching the breath, or put in the energy center below the navel (see also anapanasati). Often, a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is used to sit on; in some other cases, a chair may be used. At the beginning of the Song Dynasty, practice with the koan method became popular, whereas others practiced \\"silent illumination.\\" This became the source of some differences in practice between the Linji and Caodong traditions. Koan practice A koan (literally \\"public case\\") is a story or dialogue, generally related to Chan or other Buddhist history; the most typical form is an anecdote involving early Chinese Chan masters. These anecdotes involving famous Chan teachers are a practical demonstration of their wisdom, and can be used to test a student's progress in Chan practice. Koans often appear to be paradoxical or linguistically meaningless dialogues or questions. But to Chan Buddhists the koan is \\"the place and the time and the event where truth reveals itself\\" unobstructed by the oppositions and differentiations of language. Answering a koan requires a student to let go of conceptual thinking and of the logical way we order the world, so that, like creativity in art, the appropriate insight and response arises naturally and spontaneously in the mind. Chan monasticism Chan developed a distinct monastic system. Emphasizing daily life As the Chan school grew in China, the monastic discipline also became distinct, focusing on practice through all aspects of life. Temples began emphasizing labor and humility, expanding the training of Chan to include the mundane tasks of daily life. D.T. Suzuki wrote that aspects of this life are: a life of humility; a life of labor; a life of service; a life of prayer and gratitude; and a life of meditation. The Chinese Chan master Baizhang (720‚Äì814 CE) left behind a famous saying which had been the guiding principle of his life, \\"A day without work is a day without food\\"., entry \\"Baizhang Huaihai\\" Sinification of Buddhism in China It was scholar D.T. Suzuki's contention that a spiritual awakening was always the goal of Chan's training, but that part of what distinguished the tradition as it developed through the centuries in China was a way of life radically different from that of Indian Buddhists. In Indian Buddhism, the tradition of the mendicant prevailed, but Suzuki explained that in China social circumstances led to the development of a temple and training-center system in which the abbot and the monks all performed mundane tasks. These included food gardening or farming, carpentry, architecture, housekeeping, administration (or community direction), and the practice of Traditional Chinese medicine. Consequently, the enlightenment sought in Chan had to stand up well to the demands and potential frustrations of everyday life.

The pretransmission interval and incomplete lineage sorting in the phylogeny of a human-transmissible virus. The shaded tree represents a transmission chain where each region represents the pathogen population in each of three patients. The width of the shaded regions corresponds to the genetic diversity. In this scenario, A infects B with an imperfect transmission bottleneck, and then B infects C. The genealogy at the bottom is reconstructed from a sample of a single lineage from each patient at three distinct time points. When diversity exists in donor A, a pre-transmission interval will occur at each inferred transmission event (MRCA(A,B) precedes transmission from A to B), and the order of transmission events may become randomized in the virus genealogy. Note that the pre-transmission interval also is a random variable defined by the donor‚Äôs diversity at time of each transmission. Terminal branch lengths are also elongated due to these processes. Incomplete lineage sorting, also termed deep coalescence, retention of ancestral polymorphism, or trans-species polymorphism, describes a phenomenon in population genetics when ancestral gene copies fail to coalesce (looking backwards in time) into a common ancestral copy until deeper than previous speciation events. In other words, the tree produced by a single gene differs from the population or species level tree, producing a discordant tree. As a result, a generated species level tree may differ depending on the selected genes used for assessment. This is in contrast to complete lineage sorting, where the tree produced by the gene is the same as the population or species level tree. Both are common results in phylogenetic analysis, although it depends on the gene, organism, and sampling technique.  Concept  The concept of incomplete lineage sorting has some important implications for phylogenetic techniques. The concept itself is somewhat challenging and relies on persistence of polymorphisms across different speciation events. Suppose two subsequent speciation events occur where the ancient species gives rise to species A, and secondly to species B and C. When studying a single gene, it can contain multiple haplotypes (a polymorphism). A haplotype can be lost or fixed in a species by genetic drift. If the ancestral species has 2 haplotypes, species A will contain haplotype 1 and 2, and by genetic drift and divergence by further mutation it can fix haplotype 1a. the lineage between species A and species B and C still contain haplotypes 1 and 2. This lineage has thus incomplete sorting of the gene lineages. In species B haplotype 2 can become fixed, whereas haplotype 1b can become fixed in species C. If the phylogeny of these species is based on these genes, it will not represent the actual relationships between the species. In other words, the most related species will not necessarily inherit the most related haplotypes of genes. This is of course a simplified example and in real research it is usually more complex containing more genes and/or species. When studying primates, chimpanzees and bonobos are more related to each other than any other taxa and are thus sister taxa. Still, for 1.6% of the bonobo genome, sequences are more closely related to homologues of humans than to chimpanzees, which is probably a result of incomplete lineage sorting.  Implications  Incomplete lineage sorting has important implications for phylogenetic research. There is a chance that when creating a phylogenetic tree it may not resemble actual relationships because of this incomplete lineage sorting. However, gene flow between lineages by hybridization or horizontal gene transfer may produce the same conflicting phylogenetic tree. Distinguishing these different processes may seem difficult, but much research and different statistical approaches are (being) developed to gain greater insight in these evolutionary dynamics. One of the resolutions to reduce the implications of incomplete lineage sorting is to use multiple genes for creating species or population phylogenies. The more genes used, the more reliable the phylogeny becomes.  In diploid organisms  Incomplete lineage sorting commonly happens with sexual reproduction because the species cannot be traced back to a single person or breeding pair. When organism tribe populations are large (i.e. thousands) each gene has some diversity and the gene tree consists of other pre-existing lineages. If the population is bigger these ancestral lineages are going to persist longer. When you get large ancestral populations together with closely timed speciation events these different pieces of DNA retain conflicting affiliations. This makes it hard to determine a common ancestor or points of branching.  In Human Evolution  In human evolution, incomplete lineage sorting is used to diagram hominin lineages that may have failed to sort out at the same time that speciation occurred in prehistory. Due to the advent of genetic testing and genome sequencing, researchers found that the genetic relationships between hominin lineages might disagree with previous understandings of their relatedness based on physical characteristics. Moreover, divergence of the last common ancestor (LCA) may not necessarily occur at the same time as speciation. Lineage sorting is a method that allows paleoanthropologists to explore the genetic relationships and divergences that may not fit with their previous speciation models based on phylogeny alone. Incomplete lineage sorting of the human family tree is an area of great interest. There are a number of unknowns when considering both the transition from archaic humans to modern humans and divergence of the other great apes from the hominin lineage.  Ape and Hominin / Human divergence  Using genetic testing we can determine that the human and chimpanzee genome split dates further back than that of the human and gorilla split. What that means is the common ancestor of the human and chimpanzee have left traces of genetic material that can be found in the common ancestor of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. This makes the most recent common ancestor between gorilla and human. However, the genetic tree slightly differs from that of the species or phylogeny tree. In the phylogeny tree when we look at the evolutionary relationship between the human, bonobo chimpanzee, and gorilla, the results show that the separation of bonobo and chimpanzee transpired in a close proximity of time to the split of the common ancestor, the bonobo-chimpanzee ancestor, and humans. Indicating that humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor for several million years after separation from gorillas. This creates the phenomenon that is Incomplete lineage sorting. Today researchers are relying on DNA fragments in order to study the evolutionary relationships among humans and their counterparts in hopes that it provides information about speciation and ancestral processes from genomes from different types of humans.  In viruses  Incomplete lineage sorting is a common feature in viral phylodynamics, where the phylogeny represented by transmission of a disease from one person to the next, which is to say the population level tree, often doesn't correspond to the tree created from a genetic analysis due to the population bottlenecks that are an inherent feature of viral transmission of disease. Figure 1 illustrates how this can occur. This has relevance to criminal transmission of HIV where in some criminal cases, a phylogenetic analysis of one or two genes from the strains from the accused and the victim have been used to infer transmission; however, the commonality of incomplete lineage sorting means that transmission cannot be inferred solely on the basis of such a basic analysis. In linguistics Jacques and List (2019) show that the concept of incomplete lineage sorting can be applied to account for non-treelike phenomena in language evolution. Kalyan and Fran√ßois (2019), proponents of the method of Historical glottometry, a model challenging the applicability of the tree model in historical linguistics, concur that \\"Historical Glottometry does not challenge the family tree model once incomplete lineage sorting has been taken into account.\\" See also * Gibbon‚Äìhuman last common ancestor * Laggar falcon * Coalescent theory * Multispecies coalescent process * Lineage (evolution) References External links  Category:Phylogenetics ","title":"Incomplete lineage sorting"},{"id":"34044063","text":"Stanley J. \\"Dick\\" Williams (19 July 1891 ‚Äì 25 May 1966) was an Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Published during the reign of Philip III of Spain, it is a tragicomedy about a peasant named Perib√°√±ez, and a Comendador (Spanish article) (knight commander) who falls in love with his wife Casilda. Ultimately Perib√°√±ez must kill the Comendador in order to protect his wife from his advances. __TOC__ Plot summary Act 1 Perib√°√±ez and Casilda are celebrating their wedding when they learn that the Comendador of Oca√±a has fallen while trying to control a raging bull. He is brought to their house, and Casilda revives him from unconsciousness. The Comendador immediately falls in love with the beautiful Casilda, and is dismayed to learn that she is already married. Perib√°√±ez and Casilda enjoy their wedded bliss, but the Comendador's obsession with Casilda grows. The married couple decides to travel to Toledo for the Feast Day of the Assumption of Mary, and the Comendador gives them some tapestries to decorate their cart with. He secretly follows them to Toledo, where he pays a painter to sketch a picture of Casilda without her knowing, to be turned into a full-sized portrait later. Act 2 Perib√°√±ez and the other members of the Brotherhood of Saint Roch, the patron saint of Oca√±a, meet to discuss the state of disrepair that the icon of the saint has fallen into. It is decided that Perib√°√±ez should return to Toledo to commission an artist to repair it. The Comendador conspires with his assistants, Luj√°n and Leonardo, to find ways to seduce Casilda. Luj√°n tells the Comendador that the tapestries he gave the couple are hanging in their bedroom, which the Comendador takes as a sign of encouragement. Luj√°n decides to try and seduce Casilda's unwed cousin In√©s to get closer to Casilda. While Perib√°√±ez is in Toledo, various harvesters who work for him stay at his house. Luj√°n pretends to be one, and lets the Comendador into the house. The Comendador attempts to seduce Casilda, but she loves and is loyal to Perib√°√±ez and rejects him. Meanwhile, Perib√°√±ez visits the same artist who the Comendador ordered the portrait from and commissions him to repair the icon of Saint Roch. The painter shows him the portrait he is working on, and Perib√°√±ez recognizes his wife. The painter assures him that the woman in the picture had no idea about the portrait, and tells him who commissioned the work. Perib√°√±ez is overcome with jealousy. When he returns to Oca√±a he learns about what happened at his house while he was gone from some of the harvesters, and is glad to hear of Casilda's innocence. When he returns to his house he makes up a story about falling from his horse but being protected by Saint Roch. He claims that he wishes to give the tapestries as an offering of thanks, so that he can remove them from the bedroom, as they now remind him of the man who is lusting after his wife. Luj√°n arrives and tells him that he has been summoned by the Comendador. Act 3 The Comendador and Leonardo discuss his latest plan: The king, Enrique III, has called forces to battle against the Moors, and the Comendador will appoint Perib√°√±ez Captain of the peasant forces, so that he will go off to fight in the war, leaving the Comendador free to seduce Casilda. Perib√°√±ez arrives and approaches the Comendador, asking him to knight him so that he may fight with honor. The Comendador obliges, unwittingly elevating the peasant to his own level and giving him the right to do battle with him. The women give tokens to the men going off to battle, and Casilda gives her husband a black ribbon, which he protests is a bad omen. The men leave for war, and Leonardo meets with In√©s to make arrangements for her to let the Comendador into Casilda's house later. Leonardo tries to caution the Comendador about what he plans to do, but he is ignored. His attendants then fetch him a cape: black, like the ribbon given to Perib√°√±ez and similarly interpreted. The attendants explain that his custom of wearing brightly colored cloaks is well known and that wearing a black one will allow him to go unrecognized, but he demands a colored one. Meanwhile, Perib√°√±ez secretly returns, having doubled back from leading his troops, and walks down the street to his house, soliloquizing about the delicate nature of honor. He sneaks into his house, hiding in a pantry, where he gets covered in flour. The Comendador enters the house with the help of In√©s, and comes on to Casilda. She is dismayed to find herself betrayed by her cousin, and continues to resist the Comendador's advances. He orders In√©s and his men to leave so that he can try to rape her. Perib√°√±ez bursts from the pantry where he is hiding and mortally wounds the Comendador. Leonardo finds him, repentant for his actions and asking for a priest so that last rites can be performed. Perib√°√±ez kills In√©s and Luj√°n as well for their roles in the betrayal of himself and his wife. When the king hears of the death of one of his favored Comendadors by a mere peasant, he is enraged, but his wife, the Queen, councils him to hear Perib√°√±ez' side of the story. Perib√°√±ez humbles himself before the king and explains what happened. The king pardons him and grants him the title of Captain, the reward money posted for the capture of himself and his wife, and the right to bear arms. The queen gives Casilda four dresses from her own wardrobe.

Wilson. Produced by Blue Sky Studios as its first feature film, it was released by 20th Century Fox on March 15, 2002. The film features the voices of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary. Set during the days of the ice age, the film centers around three main characters - Manny (Romano), a no-nonsense woolly mammoth; Sid (Leguizamo), a loudmouthed ground sloth; and Diego (Leary), a sardonic saber-tooth tiger - who come across a human baby and work together to return it to its tribe. Additionally, the film occasionally follows Scrat, a speechless \\"saber-toothed squirrel\\" voiced by Wedge who is perpetually searching for a place in the ground to bury his acorn. Ice Age was originally intended as a 2D animated film developed by Fox Animation Studios, but eventually became the first full-length animated film for the newly- reformed Blue Sky, which had been reshaped from a VFX house to a computer animation studio. Focus shifted from making an action-adventure drama film to a more comedy-oriented one, and several writers, such as Michael Berg and Peter Ackerman, were brought on to bring out a wittier tone. Upon release, Ice Age received mostly positive reviews and was nominated at the 75th Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature, losing to Spirited Away. It was a box office success and grossed over $383 million, starting the Ice Age franchise, being followed by four sequels: Ice Age: The Meltdown in 2006, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs in 2009, Ice Age: Continental Drift in 2012, and Ice Age: Collision Course in 2016. Two holiday specials were also released: 2011's Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas (taking place between Dawn of the Dinosaurs and Continental Drift) and 2016's Ice Age: The Great Egg-Scapade (taking place between Continental Drift and Collision Course). Seven Ice Age short films were also released between 2002 and 2016. Plot A Cronopio known as Scrat attempts to find a place to store his acorn for the winter. Eventually, as he tries to stomp it into the ground, he inadvertently causes a large crack to form in the ice that extends for miles before setting off a large avalanche which nearly crushes him. He barely escapes but finds himself getting stepped on by a herd of prehistoric animals migrating south in order to escape the forthcoming ice age. Sid, a clumsy ground sloth, is left behind by his family and decides to move on by himself, but is attacked by two Brontotheres after ruining their meal and making them angry. Sid is soon rescued by Manny, a cynical woolly mammoth heading north, who fights the rhinos off and continues on his path. Sid joins Manny, not wanting to be alone and unprotected. Manny is annoyed by Sid's outgoing demeanor and wishes to migrate on his own, but Sid nonetheless continues to follow Manny. Meanwhile, Soto, the leader of a Smilodon pack, wants revenge on a neanderthal tribe for killing half of his pack by eating the chief's infant son, Roshan, alive. Soto leads a raid on the neanderthal camp, during which Roshan's mother flees with her son. Cornered by Soto‚Äôs lieutenant, Diego, she leaps down the waterfall with Roshan. As punishment for his failure to retrieve Roshan, Diego is sent to find and retrieve him while the rest of the pack waits for him at a mountain known as Half-Peak. If he fails, he will be killed in Roshan‚Äôs place. Later, Sid and Manny encounter the mother struggling out of the lake, dying from her plunge. The mother only has enough strength to entrust Roshan to Manny before she dies and disappears into the water. After much persuasion by Sid, they decide to return the baby, but when they reach the neanderthal settlement, they find it deserted. They meet up with Diego, who convinces the pair to let him help by tracking the neanderthals. The four travel on, with Diego secretly leading them to Half- Peak where his pack is waiting to ambush them. After encountering several misadventures on their way, the group reaches a cave with several cave paintings. There, Sid and Diego learn about Manny's past and his previous interactions with the neanderthal hunters, in which they slaughtered his family, consisting of his mate and child, leaving Manny a depressed loner. Later, the group almost reaches their destination, Half-Peak, only to encounter a forming river of lava. Manny and Sid, along with Roshan, make it across safely, but Diego ends up hanging on a cliff, about to fall into the lava. Manny saves him, narrowly missing certain death by falling into the lava himself. The herd takes a break for the night, and Roshan takes his first walking steps towards Diego, who starts to have a change of heart about his mission. The next day, the herd approaches the ambush, causing Diego, now full of respect for Manny for saving his life to change his mind and confess to Manny and Sid about the ambush. As the pair turn hostile towards him, Diego pleads for their trust and tries to foil the attack. The herd battles Soto's pack, but despite their efforts, Soto and his associates manage to corner Manny. As Soto closes in for the kill on Manny, Diego sacrifices himself by jumping in the way and is injured as a result. Manny then knocks a distracted Soto into a rock wall, causing several sharp icicles to fall onto Soto, impaling and instantly killing him. Horrified, the rest of the pack retreat. Manny and Sid mourn for Diego's injury, which they believe is fatal, and continue their journey without him. The two manage to successfully return Roshan to his tribe, and to their surprise, Diego manages to rejoin them, in time to see Roshan leave. The group then begin to head off to warmer climates. 20,000 years later, Scrat, frozen in a block of ice, ends up on the shores of a tropical island. As the ice slowly melts, an acorn that was also frozen in the same ice block is washed away. Scrat then finds a coconut and tries to stomp it into the ground, only to accidentally trigger a volcanic eruption. Cast The characters are all prehistoric animals. The animals can talk to and understand each other and are voiced by a variety of famous actors. Like many films of prehistoric life, the rules of time periods apply very loosely, as many of the species shown in the film never actually lived in the same time periods or the same geographic regions.

The film, originally envisioned as a traditionally animated movie with an action-oriented comedy-drama tone, was intended to be developed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman's Fox Animation Studios. Around the same time, Blue Sky Studios, a small visual effects studio in White Plains, New York, was bought out by Fox and reshaped into a full- fledged CG animation film studio. In light of this, Fox Animation head Chris Meledandri and executive producer Steve Bannerman approached Forte with the proposition of developing the film as a computer-animated movie, which Forte realized was \\"basically a no-brainer,\\" according to her. Michael J. Wilson, who had written and developed the film's original story treatments in conjunction with Forte, wrote the first draft for the script, and Chris Wedge, a co-founder of Blue Sky, was brought on to the project as the director in late 1998. Fox also opted for the movie to take a more comedy-oriented direction (albeit while still maintaining some dramatic elements), and brought writer Michael Berg to help emphasize a funnier tone. After being hired, Berg reportedly told the studio that he couldn't write a kid's film, to which the studio responded, \\"Great! Just write a good story.\\" Story development began in spring of 1999,http://www.cgw.com/Publications/CGW/2002/Volume-25-Issue-4-April-2002-/Ice- Pack.aspx and official production on the film began in June 2000, one week after the closure of Fox Animation Studios. 150 employees were hired to work on the film,https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/27/fox-animation-studios- closes-its-doors and a budget of $58 million was granted by Fox. Peter Ackerman was hired as a third writer for the film, and collaborated extensively with Berg for three years before the two eventually moved on from the project. Jon Vitti and Mike Reiss, both former writers for The Simpsons, were added later on after Berg and Ackerman left to further polish the script. For research, the film's development team took several trips to the Museum of Natural History early on in production in order to make sure that the film authentically felt like the Ice Age. Ultimately, the team translated the information that they had compiled in their research by stylizing it in order to fit with the film's story. A team of 32 animators went out and did research to figure out the movements of different animals; for instance, for the movement of Scrat, animators visited a park and observed local squirrels, taking note of their \\"twitchy\\" way of moving.  Writing and character development  Michael J. Wilson stated on his blog that his daughter Flora came up with the idea for an animal that was a mixture of both squirrel and rat, naming it Scrat, and that the animal was obsessed with pursuing his acorn.Ice Age: The Story Behind the Story (from the writer Michael J. Wilson), News from the Soo Theatre, Inc. Retrieved April 2nd, 2017. The plan to have Scrat talk was quickly dropped, as he worked better as a silent character for comedic effect. The name 'Scrat' is a combination of the words 'squirrel' and 'rat', as Scrat has characteristics of both species; Wedge has also called him \\"saber-toothed squirrel.\\" Scrat's opening adventure was inserted because, without it, the first real snow and ice sequence wouldn't take place until about 37 minutes into the film. This was the only role intended for Scrat, but he proved to be such a popular character with test audiences that he was given more scenes. The filmmakers made it so that many of the scenes with Scrat appear directly after dramatic moments in the film. In a 2012 interview with Jay Leno, Denis Leary revealed that his character, Diego the sabertooth, originally died near the end of the film. However, it was reported that kids in the test audience bursted into tears when his death was shown. Leary himself warned the producers that something like this would happen. When it was proven true, the scene was re-written to ensure Diego survived. Originally, Sid the Sloth was supposed to be a con-artist and a hustler, and there was even a finished scene of the character conning some aardvark kids. His character was later changed to a talkative-clumsy sloth because the team felt the audience would have hated him. There was also an alternate scene of Sid in the hottub with the ladies which shows him saying to them \\"Let's jump in the gene pool and see what happens.\\" One of the female sloths then kicks him in the groin. This was cut because it was not suitable for children and may have gotten the film a PG-13 rating. Other innuendos with Sid were also cut from the film. Sid was also supposed to have a female sloth named Sylvia (voiced by Kristen Johnston) chasing after him, whom he despised and kept ditching. All the removed scenes can be seen on the DVD.  Animation  The characters and environments in Ice Age were modeled and animated using WaveFront's Maya animation software. Rendering was completed using CGI Studio, an in-house ray tracing program being developed since Blue Sky's formation in 1987 and previously used for Wedge's 1998 short film, Bunny. While Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, released three months before Ice Age, became the first computer-animated film to make use of ray tracing technology, Ice Age would have received the distinction had it been released at the time Blue Sky began work on the movie. In order to keep the film at a more exciting pace, the development team took certain liberties with Sid in terms of realism; although real-life ground sloths were slow-moving and rigid, Sid was given a fast movement speed in certain scenes, as well as a more flexible range of motions. Conversely, the character‚Äôs arm movements were more restricted in order to retain a sense of laziness true to the nature of sloths. Manny was a particularly difficult character to animate due to his unique attributes as a mammoth, such as his long fur and massive trunks that covered up his face. Dealing with a creature which had seldom appeared in animation at the time, the team needed to figure out how Manny would realistically move with character designer Pete DeSeve explaining that ‚Äúa wooly mammoth isn‚Äôt simply an elephant with long fur‚Äù. According to co-director Carlos Saldanha, Diego was one of the most complexly animated characters in the movie, with some scenes showing off his high movement speed as a sabre-toothed tiger while others kept his movement more contained and focused on his facial expressions to carry the moment.http://cinema.com/articles/813/ice-age-production- notes.phtml  Voice casting  The voice cast of Ice Age was encouraged to make up their own dialogue during recording. Several lines in the film were improvised by the actors. For Manny the Mammoth, the studio was initially looking at people with big voices. James Earl Jones and Ving Rhames were considered, but they sounded too obvious and Wedge wanted more comedy. Instead, the role was given to Ray Romano because they thought his voice sounded very elephant-like. Wedge described Romano's voice as deep and slow in delivery, but also with a \\"sarcastic wit behind it.\\" John Leguizamo, who provided the voice for Sid the Sloth, experimented with over 40 voices for the character, including a slower-sounding voice to fit with the lazy nature of a giant sloth. Leguizamo came up with the final voice and trademark lateral lisp for the character after watching footage of sloths and learning that they store food in the pockets of their mouths which ferments over time. Leguizamo remarked in an interview with BBC that he had wanted to contribute to an animated project for a while, claiming that cartoon voice actor Mel Blanc was \\"one of my comedy Gods\\" and a large source of inspiration for him as a child.  Music  The official soundtrack to Ice Age was released on May 14, 2002 by Var√®se Sarabande. The soundtrack consists of the original musical score composed for the film by David Newman and performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony. The song \\"Send Me on My Way\\" by Rusted Root is also featured in the film but is absent from the album. ;Tracks *Opening Travel Music (1:17) *Angered Rhinos (2:14) *Humans/Diego (1:43) *Tigers Going for Baby (3:12) *Dodos (0:42) *Fighting Over the Melons (2:01) *Walking Through (1:25) *Baby's Wild Ride (1:56) *Checking Out the Cave (3:43) *Running from the Lava (2:27) *Baby Walks (1:34) *Tigers Try to Get the Baby (5:41) *Giving Back the Baby (6:26) Release Box office Ice Age was released on March 15, 2002, and had a $46.3 million opening weekend, a large number not usually seen until the summer season, and way ahead of Fox's most optimistic projection of about $30 million. Ice Age broke the record for a March opening (later surpassed in 2006 by its sequel, Ice Age: The Meltdown) and at the time was the third-best opening ever for an animated feature‚Äîafter Monsters, Inc. ($62.6 million) and Toy Story 2 ($57.4 million). Ice Age finished its domestic box office run with $176,387,405 and grossed $383,257,136 worldwide, being the 9th highest gross of 2002 in North America and the 8th best worldwide at the time. Critical reception Ice Age holds a 77% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 166 reviews, with an average rating of 6.85/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Even though Ice Age is treading over the same grounds as Monsters, Inc. and Shrek, it has enough wit and laughs to stand on its own.\\" Similar site Metacritic had a score of 60% out of 31 reviews, meaning \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote \\"I came to scoff and stayed to smile\\". Elvis Mitchell of the New York Times called the film a \\"blandly likeable computer-animation extravaganza\\", comparing the film's plot to the Western film 3 Godfathers. CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave Ice Age an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. Accolades Ice Age was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2003, losing to Spirited Away. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2008: AFI's 10 Top 10: ** Nominated Animation Film Home media The initial home video release for Ice Age was accompanied by an $85 million marketing campaign involving promotional partnerships with 14 different companies, including Microsoft, Pizza Hut, Carl's Jr., Dole, Langer's, Valpak, Cold Stone Creamery, and the National Hockey League. The movie was released on 2-disc DVD, VHS and D-Theater on November 26, 2002. All three releases included Gone Nutty, a short film starring Scrat and detailing his further antics as he tries to bury his acorn. Another single disc release was released February 5, 2005, and the next year a new two-disc release with extra features on March 14, 2006. The film was released on Blu-ray on March 4, 2008, and beside Gone Nutty, it included 9 minutes of deleted scenes. Ice Age was included on The Walt Disney Company's streaming service Disney+ on March 1, 2020. Video game A tie-in video game was developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and published by Ubisoft for the Game Boy Advance. A platform game, it has the player controlling Sid and Manny through 10 levels as they carry Roshan. The game holds an aggregate ranking of 46.00% on GameRankings and 47/100 on Metacritic. Sequels Since the release of Ice Age, several sequels have followed. Ice Age: The Meltdown, the first sequel, was released on March 31, 2006, following the main characters trying to escape a massive flooding due to global warming, as well as Manny's concern over whether or not his species is going extinct. A third installment, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, was released in 2009, followed by a fourth film, Ice Age: Continental Drift, in 2012. The fifth and latest installment, Ice Age: Collision Course, was released on July 22, 2016. With the release of Collision Course, the Ice Age series became the first animated movie franchise to house five theatrical installments. The sequels experienced steadily declining critical reception but were box office successes nonetheless.

Its highest mountain is Dev√≠nska Kobyla at 514 m (1,686 ft) AMSL, it is also the highest point in Bratislava. The hills are mostly forested with deciduous trees and most of the area is protected by numerous nature reserves, including two geologically important areas: Sandberg containing sands and sandstones from the Cenozoic Paratethys ocean and Jezuitsk√© Lesy containing rare granitic pegmatite bearing niobium-tantalum oxide minerals. Dev√≠n Carpathians are famous for its castles, most notably the Bratislava Castle and the ruins of Dev√≠n Castle. The mountains feature numerous cultural monuments, caves, tramping huts, an open-air geology museum and a chemical waste dump. Military structures in the mountains include an abandoned rocket base and preserved artillery fortifications from the time of Austria-Hungary. Featuring a dense network of forest trails, Dev√≠n Carpathians together with Bratislava Forest Park are frequented by citizens of the city and provide their main venue for hiking, mountain cycling, cross-country skiing and dog walking.  Location  The boundary of Dev√≠n Carpathians consists of the Slovak-Austrian border in the middle of the Morava and Danube rivers from the west, the road connecting Dev√≠nska Nov√° Ves and D√∫bravka from the north, the road connecting D√∫bravka with the crossing at Patr√≥nka from the north-west and east, and Mlynsk√° dolina from the south. The mountain range is located entirely within the administrative boundaries of Bratislava.  Division  Dev√≠n Carpathians are divided into four geomorphological areas, separated by a series of faults: * Bratislava Foothills () * Dev√≠n Gate () * Dev√≠nska Kobyla () * Lamaƒç Gate ()  Highest peaks  * Dev√≠nska Kobyla - 514 meters AMSL () * ≈†v√°bsky vrch - 360 meters AMSL () * V06040801 - 358 meters AMSL () * D√∫bravsk√° Hlavica - 357 meters AMSL () * Hrub√Ω Breh - 316 meters AMSL () * Kr√°ƒæov vrch - 284 meters AMSL () * Sitina - 264 meters AMSL () * Bri≈æite - 257 meters AMSL () * Dev√≠n Castle rock - 212 meters AMSL ()  Description   Geomorphology  Dev√≠n Carpathians consist of Paleozoic era landforms (south-eastern part), Mesozoic era landforms, Cenozoic era landforms, the latter including Quaternary period landforms. There are 5 caves in Dev√≠n Carpathians: Abr√°zna cave, J06041401 cave, J06041402 cave, Medzivrstvov√° cave (original name Zlepencov√° jasky≈àa) and ≈†tokeravsk√° v√°penka cave (original name Stockerau). Abr√°zna cave is a 10 meters long karst cave. Abr√°zna cave was created as a result of coastal modelling by a prehistoric Cenozoic sea and like all of the others, it is inaccessible to the public. It is supposedly the westernmost cave in Slovakia, although actually it is rather the J06041401 cave. None of the caves are open to the public. Notable rivers originating in the Dev√≠n Carpathians include ƒåierny potok and Mokr√Ω jarok (also called Mokr√Ω potok), the latter is a short stream originating at the Dev√≠nska Kobyla mountain, draining its south-eastern part. It flows into the Danube near the quarry at Dev√≠nska cesta Street, near island Siho≈•.  Notable areas  Sandberg mountain * Abandoned military rocket base () located at the summit of Dev√≠nska Kobyla. * Sandberg is a sandstone hill containing an important paleontological site, famous for its shark teeth, and bones of seals, whales and ancient monkeys. * Sorbus domestica of Dev√≠n is a protected tree, rare in Europe. This specimen is 80 years old and 10 meters tall. The tree is located in the vineyards above Dev√≠n castle. * Srdce () is a former quarry named after its shape. It contains a chemical dump of artificial asphalt waste from the bombed Apollo refinery, created in 1963 by the Slovnaft refinery in Bratislava.  Flora and fauna  Roe deer is abundant in the Dev√≠n Carpathians Flora and fauna is similar to that of the Little Carpathians, yet the area of Dev√≠nska Kobyla represents the edge of the thermophilic dry vegetation of the pannonian plane. According to the phytogeorgraphical division of J. Fut√°k (1964, 1972), Dev√≠nska Kobyla is grouped together with the neighboring Hundsheimer Berge in Austria, consisting of an area of xerothermic pannonian flora (Eupannonicum). Much of the area is densely forested with mostly pine-oak or oak-hornbeam trees. Humans have been shaping the environment in this area for centuries and anthropic changes included cutting and burning forests, creating meadows, establishing vineyards and orchards, grazing animals and planting new trees. Today, the area of Dev√≠n Carpathians contains a mixture of stony and grassy forest steppe, shrublands and dense forests. Some areas are more often visited and continually being changed over the course of centuries, other areas are relatively intact. There are numerous endemic species living inside the protected areas. The mountains are rich in mushroom diversity as the small area of Dev√≠nska Kobyla alone contains at least 234 species of identified mushrooms. Local flora contains approximately 1,100 species of plants, 25 species are protected in Slovakia. The area is notable for its Viola hybrids. Dominant flora includes Stipa pulcherrima, Carex humilis, Scabiosa suaveolena, Festuca valesiaca, Ranunculus illyricus and Bromus erectus. Protected plants include Adonis vernalis, Pulsatilla nigricans, Pulsatilla grandis, Anemone sylvestris, Lilium martagon, Stipa joannis, Jurinea mollis, Iris pumila, Dictamnus albus, Cornus mas, Prunus mahaleb, Fraxinus ornus, Chrysopogon gryllus, Vinca herbacea, Lathyrus pannonicus, Platanthera bifolia, Iris variegata, Himantoglossum adriaticum, Limodorum abortivum and Rhamnus saxatilis. Other plants include Ononis pusilla, Lathyrus sphaericus, Conringia austriaca, Potentilla pedata, Smyrnium perfoliatum, Bupleurum rotundifolium, Consolida orientalis ssp. paniculata and Asplenium adiantum-nigrum. Fauna of Dev√≠n Carpathians is notable especially for its large number of species of heat-loving insects. Insects include Coleophora dianthi, Coleophora adspersella, Coleophora virgatella, Pandemis dumetanz, Trachismia rigana, Mantispa styriaca, Zanclognatha tarsipennalis, Yponomeuta vigintipunctatus and Procris gerryon. Protected insects include Saga pedo, Mantis religiosa, Papilio machaon, Iphiclides podalirius, Ascalaphus macaronius, Lucanus cervus, Parnassius mnemosyne and others. Amphibians include Salamandra salamandra, Bufo bufo and Bufo viridis, reptiles include Lacerta viridis, Lacerta agilis, Podarcis muralis, Anguis fragilis, Zamenis longissimus, Natrix natrix, Natrix tessellata and Coronella austriaca. Birds known to hunt here include Common Rock Thrush and Saker Falcon, birds known to nest here include Common Buzzard. Mammals include the numerous Roe deer, also Fallow deer, Red deer only in the deep forest, Wild boar, Red fox and European badger. There are no wolves or bears in the mountains.  Protected areas  Almost the entire area of the mountain range is protected by the Little Carpathians Protected Landscape Area. A small 650 ha patch of Dev√≠n Carpathians is protected under the European Union network of protected areas Natura 2000. Additionally, Slovak law protects the following areas inside the mountain range: * National nature reserve Dev√≠nska Kobyla (NPR Dev√≠nska Kobyla) * National nature monument Dev√≠n Castle rock (NPP Dev√≠nska hradn√° skala) * National cultural monument Dev√≠n Castle (NKP Dev√≠n - Slovansk√© hradisko) * National cultural monument Villa Rustica (NKP Villa Rustica) * Natural monument Dev√≠n forest steppe (PP Dev√≠nska lesostep) * Nature reserve Fialkov√° valley (PR Fialkov√° dolina) * Nature reserve ≈†tokeravsk√° v√°penka (PR ≈†tokeravsk√° v√°penka) * Nature reserve Slovansk√Ω island (PR Slovansk√Ω ostrov) * Protected area Lesn√© diely (CHA Lesn√© diely) * Protected tree Sorbus domestica of Dev√≠n (CHS Dev√≠nska oskoru≈°a)  Tourism  The main access point to Dev√≠n Carpathians is located at the parking lot underneath Dev√≠n Castle. The mountains feature the following hiking trails: * Red trail TZT 0701a ‚Äì from Dev√≠n, parking to Slav√≠n.

History The Historical Bath of Siba public baths were built at natural hot springs, during the Sassanid Empire era (224‚Äì 651 CE). Ancient Sassanians built public baths to serve as rest centers. The baths served Sassanid government officials, the merchants from nearby sea ports and desert caravan routes, and the public. Healing baths Some of the baths had practitioners who offered healing treatments, using medicinal herbs and essential oils. These ointments were generally used for relieving joint pain and treating skin diseases.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005, and currently houses the Bergland Cultural & Heritage Center and The Bergland/Matchwood Historical Society Museum. History Sign in front of station Around 1900, Gunlek A. Bergland purchased lands in this area for their timber. At first Bergland shipped logs east to another sawmill, but around 1903 established a new mill on Lake Gogebic, and renamed the small surrounding community after himself. The mill and its successors ran in Bergland until 1958. However, by the 1920s, much of the land in the area was cut over, and the United States Forest Service purchased large swaths here and in other places in the Upper Peninsula. The Ottawa National Forest was established in 1931 to manage the lands, with a supervisory office at Munising. In 1935, the office was moved to Ironwood. However, with the introduction of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) to the forest, more localized offices were needed, and in the same year, seven district offices were established, including this one in Bergland. The first ranger assigned to the site, Joseph \\"Popcorn\\" Blake, arrived in 1935 and lived in town until the site was ready. In 1936, the CCC began work on the buildings, finishing the construction in 1937. It was one of the first administrative offices built in the Ottawa National Forest. The site originally contained a Ranger's Office and dwelling, a garage, an oil house and woodshed, a warehouse, a latrine, and a weather instrument station. The latter two structures have since been demolished. An Assistant Ranger's dwelling was added in 1957, a small woodshed was constructed in 1979, and a pole shed was added in 1985. However, when the ranger staff expanded to cover environmental monitoring and recreation, the site became obsolete. The station was closed in 1998. The Ottawa National Forest partnered with the Bergland Cultural & Heritage Center and The Bergland/Matchwood Historical Society Museum, who use the buildings on the site. In 2009, the Museum moved into the ranger house and garage. The Cultural & Heritage Center uses the office and the remainder of the buildings. Description The Bergland Administrative Site consists of six frame buildings constructed in 1936/37, and three more structures built latter which are non-contributing. The structures are located along a curved drive. Ranger Station Office: The Ranger Station Office is a -story Colonial Revival building, based on a standard Forest Service plan, measuring 26 by 30 feet. The structure is wood framed with weatherboard siding and sits on a poured concrete foundation. The entry is through a front-gable, enclosed entry porch centered in the front facade and surrounded by a wood cornice and Doric motif pilasters. On the inside, offices are located on the first and second floors, and mechanicals in the basement. Ranger's Dwelling: The Ranger's Dwelling is a two-story side-gabled Colonial Revival, also based on a standard Forest Service plan, measuring 26 by 36 feet. The structure is wood-framed with weatherboard siding and sits on a poured concrete foundation. The entry is through a front door with stoop, surrounded by a wood cornice and Doric motif pilasters. A small porch is attached to the rear, and a massive, brick-lined stone chimney stands toward the front to one side. On the inside, the living room, dining room, and second-floor bedrooms have original wood flooring, while the kitchen, bathrooms, and porch are covered in linoleum. In the living room, the fireplace has a brick hearth and surrounds with a finely crafted mantel above and built-in bookcases on either side. Garage: The garage is a single-story, two-bay, wood-framed, side-gable structure measuring 22 feet by 22 feet. It is also based on a standard Forest Service plan. Each bay has an overhead door. Warehouse: The warehouse is a 22-foot-by-60-foot side-gable structure with weatherboard siding covering wood framing. It has four garage bays with overhead doors and a pedestrian entrance at one side. The interior is partitioned into two halves. Oil Shed: The oil shed is a front-gable, one- story shed measuring 10 feet by 12 feet and covered with weatherboard siding on a poured concrete foundation. It has a single door, and is based on a standard Forest Service plan. Woodshed: The woodshed is a front-gable, one- story shed covered with weatherboard siding on a poured concrete foundation.

A second edition, with major changes, was published by Foscolo in Zurich (1816) and a third one in London (1817). The model was Goethe's novel The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774). Another influence is Rousseau's Julie, or the New Heloise (1761). Foscolo's work was also inspired by the political events that occurred in Northern Italy during the Napoleonic period, when the Treaty of Campoformio forced Foscolo to go into exile from Venice to Milan. The autobiographic elements reflect into the novel. Ortis is composed by letters written by Jacopo to his friend Lorenzo Alderani; the last chapter is the description of the young man's last hours and suicide written by Lorenzo. The plot is located in the countryside near Padua and takes place between October 1797 and March 1799. Jacopo Ortis is a patriot who must retreat in a village in Colli Euganei to escape political persecutions. Here he meets a girl, named Teresa, and her family. The two youths fall in love, but this love is impossible, since the girl is fianc√©e to Odoardo, and Jacopo is in no condition to offer her a marriage. In despair, Jacopo travels through Italy (then divided into various little states) and visits many cities, among them Florence, with the historical tombs of Santa Croce, Milan, where he meets Giuseppe Parini, Genoa, Ventimiglia. After a deep meditation about nature, history and human fate, he resolves to go back to Veneto. He visits Teresa, then his mother. Finally he commits suicide.

Cochrane played for Edinburgh Rugby from 2014 until his retirement at the end of the 2018 season having spent the early parts of his career in England. A former captain of the Scotland under 21s, he was known as a hard-hitting forward with plenty of pace and power. Background When he was fifteen he took up rugby at Boroughmuir High School after his friends convinced him to play in their team. Cochrane initially played rugby union at centre before moving to flanker. Whilst playing for Boroughmuir he was spotted by the Under 16s State School Scotland Rugby Union Team, which led to an academy place with Edinburgh Rugby. In 2003 Cochrane was called up to the Scotland Under-21s, captaining the team between 2004 and 2005. Club career Rotherham Titans In 2005 he was offered his first professional contract by RFU Championship side the Rotherham Titans. During his three years at Rotherham, Cochrane made 83 appearances at flanker scoring 70 points and was voted player of the year in his final season for them. Doncaster Knights In 2008 Cochrane signed a full-time contract with the Doncaster Knights where once again supporters voted him Player of the Year in 2010. During his three years at the Knights, Cochrane made 75 appearances scoring 60 points. Bedford Blues Bedford Blues moved in to sign Cochrane from Doncaster Knights at the beginning of the 2011‚Äì12 RFU Championship where he changed from the position of flanker to hooker. Bedford Director of Rugby Mike Rayer said \\"We are delighted that he has agreed to join us next season, you only need to have seen Doncaster in action this season to realise how important a player Neil has been to the Knights.\\" Cochrane quickly established himself as the starting hooker for the Blues, who secured second position in the 2011‚Äì12 RFU Championship table with a win over Nottingham in the last game of the season. Whilst in preparations for the semi-finals of the Championship play offs against London Welsh Bedford agreed a new 12-month deal with Cochrane to continue playing in his new position for the 2012‚Äì13 Championship season. London Wasps On 3 May 2013, Cochrane leaves Bedford Blues for London Wasps, who compete in the Aviva Premiership for the 2013‚Äì14 season. Edinburgh Rugby On 27 January 2014, Cochrane returns to Scotland to rejoin with his hometown club Edinburgh Rugby for the 2014‚Äì15 season.

It constituted the translation base for the translation of the New Testament into English by William Tyndale, the King James Version, and most other Reformation-era New Testament translations throughout Western and Central Europe. * The Majority Text represents the Byzantine text-type, which was used in Eastern Greek speaking churches and was dominant from the late middle ages onwards. It is similar to the Textus Receptus. * The modern critical text (e.g. Novum Testamentum Graece) is close to the Alexandrian text-type, which accounts for some of the earliest New Testament manuscripts; it stands behind most modern English translations of the New Testament including the American Standard Version, New International Version, Revised Standard Version, New Revised Standard Version, New American Standard Bible, Jerusalem Bible, New American Bible, English Standard Version, and others.

This image was popularized by member Elizabeth Margaret Chandler, based on Josiah Wedgwood's male equivalent for the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. The Philadelphia Female Anti- Slavery Society (PFASS) was founded in December 1833 and dissolved in March 1870 following the ratification of the 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. It was founded by eighteen women, including Mary Ann M'Clintock, Margaretta Forten, her mother Charlotte, and Forten's sisters Sarah and Harriet.Smith, Jessie Carney and Wynn, Linda T. Freedom Facts and Firsts: 400 Years of the African American Civil Rights Experience Visible Ink Press, 2009. p. 242. Christian, Charles M. and Bennett, Sari. Black Saga: The African American Experience: A Chronology Basic Civitas Book, 1998. p. 1833. . The society was a local chapter affiliated with the American Anti-Slavery Society created the same year by William Lloyd Garrison and other leading male abolitionists. The PFASS was formed as a result of the inability of women to become members of the male abolitionist organization. This predominantly white though racially mixed female abolitionist organization illustrates the important behind-the-scenes collective roles women played in the abolitionist movement. It also exemplifies the dynamics of gender and race within American patriarchal society that emphasized the cult of true womanhood (or cult of domesticity) in the nineteenth century.  Membership  Historians often cite the PFASS as one of the few racially integrated anti-slavery societies in the antebellum era, rare even among female anti-slavery societies. PFASS membership typically came from middle-class backgrounds. The best known white female abolitionist affiliated with the PFASS is Lucretia Mott. Angelina Grimk√©, a noted female abolitionist, also joined the organization. White female members were mostly Quakers; historian Jean R. Soderlund maintains thirteen of the seventeen founding white women founders were Hicksite Quakers. Free black females helped organize the society as well. Prominent individuals included Grace Bustill Douglass and Sarah Mapps Douglass, Hetty Reckless, and Charlotte Forten (wife of notable abolitionist James Forten) and her daughters, Harriet, Sarah, and Margaretta . These women represented the city's African American elite.Soderlund, pp. 69, 74 Historian Shirley Yee states that seven of the eighteen women who signed the PFASS constitution were black, and ten black women appear regularly in society records. Furthermore, many black women members consistently served in leadership roles.Yee, pp. 90, 95 Sarah Forten was a co-founder of the Society and served on its board of managers for three consecutive terms. Margaretta Forten was a co-founder of the Society and often served as recording secretary or treasurer, as well as helping to draw up its organizational charter and serving on its educational committee.Gordon, Ann D. (ed.) et al. African American Women and the Vote: 1837-1965 University of Massachusetts Press, 1997. p. 33. . She also offered the Society's last resolution, which praised the post-civil war amendments as a success for the anti-slavery cause. Through holding key offices, historian Janice Sumler-Lewis claims the efforts of the Forten women enabled this predominantly white organization to reflect a black abolitionist perspective that oftentimes was more militant. Historian Julie Winch suggests that the free black middle-class females in Philadelphia initially organized female literacy societies prior to their membership in the PFASS. She argues these literacy societies offered black middle-class females opportunities to educate themselves and their children as well as to develop the necessary skills for community activism. According to Winch, it was hardly coincidental that members of the literacy societies also enrolled in the PFASS, and these societies were an integral part of the antislavery crusade.  Abolitionist activities  In the 1830s, the PFASS largely focused on circulating antislavery petitions, holding public meetings, organizing fundraising efforts, and financially supporting community improvement for free blacks. Between 1834 and 1850, the PFASS sent numerous petitions to the Philadelphia state legislature and to Congress. The PFASS pressed the Pennsylvania legislature to allow jury trials for suspected fugitive slaves. They petitioned Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia and prohibit the interstate slave trade. Black female leaders in the PFASS served on committees that coordinated these drives. During this period when women had not yet been granted the right to vote, petition drives were one of the few forms of political expression available to women. Petition campaigns drew women out of their homes and into their neighborhoods where they conducted massive grassroots propaganda campaigns. Face-to-face communications and door-to-door efforts by women not only challenged social norms of femininity but it also \\"moved the antislavery movement from a predominantly moral to a predominantly political focus\\".Salerno, p. 68 Petitions like these eventually caused the U.S. House of Representatives to pass the gag rule. The refusal of Congress to consider these petitions as well as fear of mob violence led to a shift in strategies in the 1840s. As the society matured, it reduced efforts to circulate petitions and increasingly devoted time to fundraising. The primary PFASS fundraiser was an annual fair in which handcrafted items such as needlework with abolitionist inscriptions and antislavery publications were sold. For example, the well-known piece of abolitionist literature, The Anti-Slavery Alphabet was printed and sold at the 1846 Philadelphia Anti-Slavery Fair. PFASS meetings consisted of coordinating activities for the fair and organizing sewing circles. By the 1850s, the fairs became elaborate occasions. In addition to selling items, the fairs featured speeches by well known abolitionists that attracted large audiences willing to pay admissions fees.Soderlund, pp. 80‚Äì82 The society's successful fundraising efforts enabled it to secure power and influence in the state anti-slavery society. Throughout the entire period, the PFASS provided a large proportion of all funds donated to the state society. From 1844 to 1849, funds raised by the Philadelphia women covered approximately 20 percent of the state anti- slavery society budget and accounted for 31 to 45 percent of donations. Hence, women were able to keep a high profile and assert their authority in leadership roles within the statewide abolitionist movement.Soderlund, pp. 83-84 Financially supporting the free black community was also an aspect of the activities within the PFASS. Led primarily by its black female membership, the PFASS financially supported Sarah Douglass's school for free black girls. According to political scientist Gayle T. Tate in her book, Unknown Tongues: Black Women's Political Activism in the Antebellum Era, 1830-1860, the society continued its financial support with annual contributions throughout the 1840s.Tate, p. 192 Tate maintains the Forten women's leadership and support led to the continuous contributions to the school. This reinforces the contention that black women played in integral leadership role within the PFASS. The PFASS also raised money for clothing, shelter, and food to aid fugitive slaves. Black women members under the leadership of Hetty Reckless worked closely with the Vigilance Association of Philadelphia, an all-male benevolent society that aided fugitive slaves. Reckless \\"persuaded society members to contribute to community projects and to make donations ... to provide fugitives with room and board, clothing, medical assistance, employment, financial aid, and advice concerning their legal rights.\\"Tate, p. 212 However, white female members of the society were quite divided over whether aid to fugitive slaves counted as true antislavery work. Lucretia Mott believed this activity was not the role of the PFASS.Yee, p. 99 This division illustrates a difference in abolitionist agendas that began to emerge among the two races.Salerno, pp. 140-1 Unlike their white female counterparts, black women, in an effort that Tate labels \\"pragmatic abolitionism,\\" viewed subversive strategies like aiding fugitive slaves as compatible with the open challenges preferred by white abolitionists.Tate, p. 213 White female abolitionists, on the other hand, tended to view these actions as \\"potential distractions from the main goal of fighting slavery.\\"Salerno, p. 141  Birth of women's rights  As women played a pertinent role in the abolitionist movement, white and black members of the PFASS supported the radical idea of granting women the right to vote and to perform traditionally male roles such as speaking in public.Yee, p. 104 Writing in the late 1970s, historian Ira V. Brown identifies the women of the PFASS as playing a key role in the development of American feminism or what she labels as the \\"cradle of feminism.\\" Brown primarily focuses on the society's white female leadership and the key roles these women played in the eventual birth of the women's movement beginning at the Seneca Falls Convention. More recent additions to the historiography of female abolitionist societies incorporates the collective role of free black females. Shirley Yee asserts that black female community activists like those in the PFASS helped shape black women's community activism for later generations, especially in the modern civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.Yee, p. 157 In popular culture *Ain Gordon's 2013 play If She Stood, commissioned by the Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia, takes place at a fictional meeting of the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society.Salisbury, Stephen. \\"Painted Bride productions on 19th century women touch familiar issues\\" Philadelphia Inquirer (April 26, 2013)  References  Notes Bibliography   External links  * \\"Our Sphere of Influence: Women Activists and the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society\\" Historical Society of Pennsylvania * \\"Cradle of Feminism, The Philadelphia Anti-Slavery Society, 1833-1840\\" Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography (April 1978) * \\"Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society Historical Marker\\" on ExplorePAhistory.com * \\"The Anti-Slavery Alphabet.

The culture is known mainly from excavation of burial sites, starting in 1959, which yielded a large collection of artefacts.  Discovery  The majority of the artifacts presently located at the Abkhaz Federal Museum in Sukhumi were found in 1959 by local schoolboy (Yuri Voronov), who later became a prominent archaeologist and Caucasiologist. He collected and saved from destruction over a thousand objects of Tsebelda culture, including spears, axes, jewelry, glass, and clay vessels. The findings of the young archaeologist interested scientists, and systematic archaeological excavations of the monuments and treasures of Tsebelda culture began as early as 1960. An archaeological expedition led by M. M. Trapsh produced the first excavations of the necropolis of this culture at one of fortresses, referred to as the \\"Hat\\". The first reasonably complete publications appeared in 1970‚Äì1971. Scientific reports were prepared by archaeologists IN.L. Lekvinadze, M.M. Trapsh, Str.T.O. Shamba, M.M. Gunba, and YU.N. Raven, giving a full picture of the Tsebelda culture of the ancient Apsilae.  Dating  On the basis of the artifacts found, the necropoles in the Tsebelda culture are attributed mainly to the first to fifth centuries CE. Voronov identifies the ethnicity of the population that used the necropoles as members of the ancient Abkhazian tribes Apsilae and Abasci. Materials found at Raskopannoye (), a rich burial site with Byzantine coins of Justinian I (reigned 527‚Äì565), have contradicted previous erroneous dating. Tsebelda burial grounds ceased to function at the end of seventh to the beginning of eighth centuries, as a consequence of the Arab invasions of the first half of the eighth century. One layer of the site was dated to the first through third centuries via the examination of one- and two-part brooches, small glass beads, Roman silver coins with the image of the emperors Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius, and other items. A second burial site contains artifacts dating to the fourth and fifth centuries, including glass vials, amphorae, Roman silver coins with the image of the emperor Julia Domna, fibulae, a brooch, a cross bow, and a jug with an ovoid shape adorned with a cross in the early Christian style.  Burials  Between 1960 and 1962, archaeologists unearthed more than 100 graves, six of which were of horses. Monuments were also unearthed dating from the beginning of the sixth century BCE. The graves were differentiated into two types. The majority, some 82 per cent of cases, have an elongated rectangular burial pit. The dead were laid on their backs with their heads to the northwest or the southwest. In the remaining eighteen per cent of the burials, the dead were cremated, along with their ornaments. The cremation was performed off-site, and the ashes were placed in red clay urns with two looped handles.  Weapons  A large number of weapons were found in the excavations, including single- and double-bladed swords, many daggers, unique axes, arrowheads, and shields. The axes, dated from the first through nineteenth centuries, are considered particularly characteristic of the Tsebelda culture.  See also  * K.I. Berdzenishvili. \\"Pottery from the Late Tsebelda.

He was the fourth son of Edward John Nettlefold (the son of John Sutton Nettlefold, 1792‚Äì1866) and was born in London in 1866. In 1878, he came to Birmingham and after leaving school entered the Broad Street offices of Messrs. Nettlefold and Co. (later GKN). Subsequently, he resigned his post and became managing director of Kynoch Ltd, a position he retained for many years. He was also chairman of Thomas Smith's Stampings Ltd, and a director of Henry Hope and Sons Ltd for a considerable period. Memorial plaque to John Sutton Nettlefold within Moorpool Hall In 1898 he entered the City Council as a representative of Edgbaston and Harborne Ward, and remained a Councillor until 1911. In addition to his work for social reform Nettlefold was interested in charitable and philanthropic movements. For several years he was honorary secretary, and afterwards chairman of the Women's Hospital, and a liberal subscriber to its funds. He was also at one time honorary treasurer of the Graham Street Charity School, and took a keen interest in the work of the Fazeley Street Mission. Nettlefold was a Justice of the Peace for Worcestershire, and also a magistrate for the city of Birmingham. Whilst living in Birmingham, Nettlefold commissioned a home for his family from the architect Joseph Lancaster Ball. The resulting Arts and Crafts style house was called Winterbourne and it and its grounds are open to the public, the latter forming the University of Birminghams' Winterbourne Botanic Garden. Nettlefold's most notable contribution was to the improvement of public housing in Birmingham for the working classes. In 1901, as the chairman of Birmingham's new Housing Committee he extended the city's slum clearance works. In 1907 when the majority of inner city housing was of a crowded back-to-back design, Nettlefold established the garden suburb Moor Pool in Harborne to provide low density affordable housing with many interspersed green spaces, centred around a community hall. His publications on urban planning included \\"Slum Reform and Town Planning\\", and \\"Practical Housing\\".

Mar intended the building for the principal residence of the Erskine family in Stirling, whose chief had become hereditary keeper of the nearby royal Stirling Castle where the princes of Scotland were schooled. Wark is a Scots language word for work, and here it means building. The house is also called \\"Mar's Lodging.\\" Description The building fronts the kirk yard of the Holy Rude Church and sits at the head of the processional route to Stirling Castle above the town's tollbooth. The windowless front fa√ßade survives lacking its upper storey, access is possible to the first floor. The basement vaults have doors and windows to the street and may have been intended for shops. The fa√ßade is nearly symmetrical around a gatehouse frontispiece with two polygonal towers. Liberal carved stone decoration is based on European print- sources or decorative arts with royal and Erskine heraldry, and wry inscriptions. A motif of the letter \\"A\\" with the earl's coronet points to a variant version of the family name, as \\"Areskine,\\" or possibly the initial of Mar's countess, Annabella Murray. Traditionally it has been alleged that the carvings include stones re-cycled from Cambuskenneth Abbey. The general articulation and architectural mouldings closely reflect royal buildings, especially the palace at Stirling Castle. The Earl of Mar may well have called upon the skills of the royal Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland of the time, William MacDowall.Miles Glendinning, Ranald MacInnes, Aonghus MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architure, EUP, (1996), pp.60-61. The Wark is now protected by the Scottish Government as a scheduled monument. Inscriptions The middle Scots inscriptions carved on the gatehouse centrepiece refer to the onlooker's appreciation of the architecture and the eminence of the Regent himself in the building's own voice: > South tower > I pray all luikaris on this luging > With gentile E to gif thair juging > I pray all lookers on this lodging, > With gentle eye to give their judging. > North tower > The moir I stand on oppin hitht > My faultis moir subject ar to sitht > The more I stand on open height, > My faults more subject are to sight. > (As I am so prominent, so my faults are more obvious) > Internal (exit) arch > Esspy speik furth and spair nocht > Considder veil I cair notht > See, speak forth and spare not (or possibly; question not), > Consider well, I care not.Fleming, J. S., (1905), 167. History It is often said that the building was never finished, but there is little evidence for this, although it was probably unfinished at the death of Regent Mar in October 1572. It seems from the records of Stirling burgh that his widow Countess Annabella continued to use the building. In April 1584 supporters of the Earl of Angus were ordered to surrender the castle and the town gates of Stirling with the \\"lodging of Annabell, Countess of Mar, and other places of fortification.\\"David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1578-1585, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), p. 657.

As the lodging commands Broad Street and the town it was later used to mount artillery during civil unrest.

Two variants were offered in 2010.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al.: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015‚Äì16, page 50. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. Design and development The Fascination F100 is an advanced version of the ultralight/VLA airplane which was based on the all composite VLA layout of the Fascination (D4BK) by Wolfgang Dallach. During and after his collaboration with Wolfgang Dallach, Jaroslav Sedl√°ƒâek from UL-Jih in the Czech Republic made own contributions to the design which finally led to today's UL-Jih F-100. The Fascination was marketed by WD Flugzeugleichtbau of Germany as the Dallach D.4 Fascination. This was an aircraft of mixed construction, including wood, composites and steel components with fabric covering. It first flew in 1996. An all- composites version, the Dallach D.4 BK Fascination was flown in 1999. UL-Jih fabricated these models and claimed sole production and marketing rights both to the D.4 and D.5 when WD Flugzeugliechtbau ceased trading in 2005, though those rights are challenged by Swiss Light Aircraft AG, who build their own versions. Current Fascinations are all-composite aircraft, with a low wing of trapezoidal planform. The ailerons have external balance trim tabs and sealed nosegaps. Inboard, there are electrically operated Fowler flaps. The fuselage becomes slender towards the tail, where the trapezoidal tailplane is set at mid-height, the elevators having a small cutout for rudder movement. The fin is swept but the rudder has vertical edges; it extends to the bottom of the fuselage. The cockpit seats two in side-by-side configuration under a one- piece bubble canopy, lever hinged from the rear; behind the seat backs there is luggage space. Until 2008, all Fascinations had a retractable tricycle undercarriage. The main wheels, mounted from the fuselage on cantilever spring legs, retract electrically outward into the wing and the nosewheel retracts rearwards. The fixed wheel option has wheel fairings. The main wheels have brakes and the nosewheel power steering. A Stratos Magnum 501 ballistic recovery parachute is fitted. The Fascination may be powered either by a 73.5 kW (98.6 hp) Rotax 912ULS or a 59.6 kW (79.9 hp) Rotax 912UL. Operational history The Fascination has been marketed both complete and in kit form. More than 200 had been sold by 2006 and 183 appeared on the mid-2010 civil registers of European countries, excluding Russia. It was reported that Fascination-airplanes (various versions) were flying in countries as remote as Brazil, Australia, and the Philippines.

During the Korean War, individuals such as former Philippine guerrilla commanders Col. Wendell Fertig and Lt. Col. Russell W. Volckmann used their wartime experience to formulate the doctrine of unconventional warfare that became the cornerstone of the Special Forces.Department of the Army (COL Russell W. Volckmann), FM 31-21, Organization and Conduct of Guerrilla Warfare (Washington, DC: GPO, October 1951) In 1951, Major General Robert A. McClure chose former OSS member Colonel Aaron Bank as Operations Branch Chief of the Special Operations Division of the Psychological Warfare Staff (OCPW) in the Pentagon.Officer Efficiency Report, Bank, Aaron, 11 May 1952, Aaron Bank Service Record, National Military Personnel Records Center, St. Louis, Missouri In June 1952, the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was formed under Col. Aaron Bank, soon after the establishment of the Psychological Warfare School, which ultimately became today's John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School. The 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was split, with the cadre that kept the designation 10th SFG deployed to Bad T√∂lz, Germany, in September 1953. The remaining cadre at Fort Bragg formed the 77th Special Forces Group, which in May 1960 was reorganized and designated as today's 7th Special Forces Group. Since their establishment in 1952, Special Forces soldiers have operated in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, North Vietnam, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Colombia, Panama, Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, 1st Gulf War, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Philippines, Syria, Yemen, Niger and, in an FID role, East Africa. Creation Some of the Office of Strategic Services have much more similarity in terms of the mission with the original U.S. Army Special Forces function, unconventional warfare (UW), acting as cadre to train and lead guerrillas in occupied countries. The Special Forces motto, De oppresso liber (Latin: \\"to free the oppressed\\") reflects this historical mission of guerrilla warfare against an occupying power. Specifically, the three-man Jedburgh teams provided leadership to French Resistance units. The larger Office of Strategic Services \\"OSS\\" Operational Groups (OG) were more associated with Strategic Reconnaissance/Direct Action (SR/DA) missions, although they did work with resistance units. Colonel Aaron Bank, considered the founding commander of the first Special Forces Group created, served in OSS during World War II. Another unit widely associated with the origins of the Army Special Forces was the First Special Service Force, a joint Canadian-American unit formed in 1942 and disbanded in 1944. Members of the First Special Service Force were retroactively awarded the Special Forces Tab upon its creation in 1983 for their part in Special Forces' history. Each year, a joint 1st Special Forces Group-Canadian Special Operations Regiment exercise, known as Menton Week is held to commemorate the historical link that both units share in the First Special Service Force. While Filipino American guerrilla operations in the Japanese-occupied Philippines are not part of the direct lineage of Army Special Forces, some of the early Special Forces leadership were involved in advising and creating the modern organization. They would use what they have learned fighting as a guerilla unit in the doctrine of unconventional warfare in the Special Forces.Keats, John. (1965). They Fought Alone. Pocket Books, Inc. OCLC 251563972 p.445 They included Russell Volckmann, who commanded guerrillas in Northern Luzon and in Korea, Donald Blackburn, who also served with the Northern Luzon force, and Colonel Wendell Fertig, who developed a division- sized force on Mindanao. During the Korean War, United Nations Partisan Forces Korea operated on islands and behind enemy lines. These forces were also known as the 8086th Army Unit, and later as the Far East Command Liaison Detachment, Korea, FECLD-K 8240th AU. These troops directed North Korean partisans in raids, harassment of supply lines, and the rescue of downed pilots. Since the initial Special Forces unit, the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was activated on 19 June 1952, and the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950, U.S. Army Special Forces did not operate as a unit in that war. Experience gained in the Korean War, however, influenced the development of U.S. Army Special Forces doctrine. The \\"U.S. 6th Army Special Reconnaissance Unit\\" aka the Alamo Scouts included in the lineage of the U.S. Special Forces Their lineage dates back to include more than 200 years of unconventional warfare history, with notable predecessors including the American Revolutionary War \\"Swamp Fox\\" Francis Marion, the WWII OSS Jedburgh Teams, OSS Detachment 101 in Burma, and the Alamo Scouts. Since their establishment in 1952, Special Forces soldiers have operated in Vietnam, El Salvador, Panama, Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Philippines, and, in an FID role, Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa, which was transferred to Africa Command in 2008. Special Forces were formed in 1952, initially under the U.S. Army Psychological Warfare Division headed by then Brigadier General Robert A. McClure. Special Operations Command was formed by the U.S. Army Psychological Warfare Center which was activated in May 1952. The initial 10th Special Forces Group was formed in June 1952, and was commanded by Colonel Aaron Bank. The first Executive Officer was LTC William C. Martin, Jr. The 10th SFG's formation coincided with the establishment of the Psychological Warfare School, which is now known as the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School. Bank served with various Office of Strategic Services (OSS) units, including Jedburgh teams advising and leading French Resistance units before the Battle of Normandy, or the \\"D-Day\\" invasion of 6 June 1944. Bank is known as the father of the Special Forces. LTC Martin was a Mustang having enlisted at age 17, he was promoted to second lieutenant during WWII. Before being commissioned he was the US VIIth Army's Boxing Champion for his weight class. He served as a company commander with the 82 Airborne, and saw action in North Africa, Sicily, Market Garden, and the Battle of the Bulge. He received his third combat jump star in Korea while serving with the 187th Regimental Combat Team. He retired as a LTC at age 37 while serving in Bad T√∂lz with the 10th Special Forces Group. The 10th SFG deployed to Bad T√∂lz, Germany the following September, the remaining cadre at Fort Bragg, North Carolina formed the 77th Special Forces Group, which in May 1960 became 7th Special Forces Group. The Special Forces branch was established as a basic branch of the United States Army on 9 April 1987, by Army General Order No. 35. Brigadier General William P. Yarborough (left) meets with President John F. Kennedy at Fort Bragg, N.C., 12 Oct. 1961 First deployment in Cold War-era Europe 10th Special Forces Group was responsible, among other missions, to operate a stay-behind guerrilla operation after a presumed Soviet overrunning of Western Europe, in conjunction with the program that later became controversially known as Operation Gladio. Through the Lodge-Philbin Act, it acquired a large number of Eastern European immigrants who brought much area and language skills. Green Light Teams were Special Forces units during the height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. These Green Light Teams, also referred to as Atomic Demolition Munitions Specialists, were trained to advance, arm, and deploy Special Atomic Demolition Munitions behind enemy lines.https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/01/30/the-littlest-boy/ As well as preparing for the Warsaw Pact invasion that never came, Vietnam and other areas of South Vietnam, El Salvador, Colombia, Panama and Afghanistan are the major modern conflicts that have defined the Special Forces. Southeast Asia (Indochina Wars) Special Forces Group organization in the Vietnam Era The Vietnam era saw the testing and shaping of Special Forces policy and action for the United States. The mission of the Special Forces changed rapidly in the first years from a force which had initially been used like its WWII predecessors as an internal strike force into a training force which helped develop unconventional warfare and counterinsurgency tactics. The period between 1961‚Äì1965 were especially formative. The first U.S. Special Forces operations in Vietnam were in 1957, when soldiers from the 1st Special Forces Group trained fifty eight Vietnamese Army soldiers at the Commando Training Center in Nha Trang. Special Forces units deployed to Laos as \\"Mobile Training Teams\\" (MTTs) in 1961, Project White Star (later named Project 404), and they were among the first U.S. troops committed to the Vietnam War. Beginning in the early 1950s, Special Forces teams deployed from the United States and Okinawa to serve as advisers for the fledgling South Vietnamese Army. As the United States escalated its involvement in the war, the missions of the Special Forces expanded as well. Since Special Forces were trained to lead guerrillas, it seemed logical that they would have a deep understanding of counter-guerrilla actions, which became the Foreign Internal Defense (FID) mission. The 5th Special Forces Group mixed the UW and FID missions, often leading Vietnamese units such as Montagnards and lowland Civilian Irregular Defense Groups. The deep raid on Son Tay, attempting to recover U.S. prisoners of war, had a ground element completely made up of Special Forces soldiers. B. R. Lang, wearing 6th SFG flash, 1970. (TDY Laos Project 404; 1971 Studies and Observations Group). The main SF unit in South Vietnam was the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne). SF soldiers assigned to the 5th Group earned sixteen Medals of Honor in Vietnam, making it the most prominently decorated unit for its size in that conflict. The unit was also awarded the coveted Presidential Unit Citation for extraordinary heroism during the Vietnam War from 1 November 1966 ‚Äì 31 January 1968. Army Special Forces personnel also played predominant roles in the highly secret, covert, multi-service Military Assistance Command Vietnam Studies and Observation Group (MACV-SOG), with an extraordinarily large number of covert U.S. military personnel killed or lost MIA while operating on Studies and Observations Group (SOG) reconnaissance missions in Laos and Cambodia. During the prolonged conflict the Army Special Forces trained regular and paramilitary units of several Allied nations as well as US reconnaissance members; supervised the indigenous Civilian Irregular Defense Group stationed throughout Vietnam in fortified camps and as backup reserves; monitored the border region and infiltration routes; conducted strategic intelligence missions and fielded numerous elements engaged in special operational tasks.Stanton, Shelby, Green Berets at War: U.S. Army Special Forces in Southeast Asia 1956‚Äì1975, Presidio Press, 1985 and Stanton, Shelby, Special Forces at War: An Illustrated History, Southeast Asia 1957‚Äì1975, Zenith Press, 2008 From 1957 to 1973, 882 Special Forces Soldiers died, killed in action or missing in Southeast Asia (including 121 in Laos and 32 in Cambodia). The \\"Green Beret Affair\\": U. S. Special Forces received a severe damage to its reputation when in July 1969 Colonel Robert Rheault, Commander of 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), six subordinate Green Beret officers, including his headquarters staff intelligence officer, and a sergeant first class (SFC) were arrested for the murderJeff Stein, Murder in Wartime: The Untold Spy Story that Changed the Course of the Vietnam War. (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1992) 60‚Äì62 of Thai Khac Chuyen, a suspected North Vietnamese double agent. It was suspected that Chuyen was providing the North Vietnamese Army information about Project GAMMA and the indigenous agents used by the 5th Special Forces Group. Thai Khac Chuyen's name was found on captured documents recovered from a MACV-SOG recon mission in Laos. An attempted cover-up was uncovered when the SFC became concerned that he might be a 'fall guy' and contacted the local Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) office chief. In September 1969 Secretary of the Army Stanley Resor announced that all charges would be dropped since the CIA, in the interests of national security, had refused to make its personnel available as witnesses; implying some sort of involvement.Seals, Bob (2007) The \\"Green Beret Affair\\": A Brief Introduction, http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thCentury/articles/greenberets.aspx El Salvador In the 1980s, U.S. Army Special Forces trainers were deployed to El Salvador. Their mission was to train the Salvadoran Military, who at the time were fighting a civil war against the left-wing guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). In 1992, the FMLN reached a ceasefire agreement with the government of El Salvador. Following the success of SF in El Salvador, the 3rd Special Forces Group was reactivated in 1990. Colombia In the late 1980s, major narcotics trafficking and terrorist problems within the region covered by the Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) worsened. USSOUTHCOM was (and remains) responsible for all of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean (CARIBCOM). The 7th Special Forces Group deployed detachments, trainers and advisers in conjunction with teams from the 1st Psychological Operations Battalion to assist Host Nation (HN) forces. During the late 1990s, 7 SFG(A) also deployed to Colombia and trained three Counter Narcotics Battalions and assisted in the establishment of a Brigade Headquarters. These were the first units of their kind in Colombia and each is known as \\"Batall√≥n Contra Narcotraficantes\\" or BACNA. These elements continue to be very successful against the narcotics industry which thrives in Colombia. U.S. Army Special Forces detachments still rotate among various locations within Colombia, training HN units in counter-guerrilla and counter- narcotics roles, and SF detachments routinely deploy to other countries within the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility. Invasion of Panama In late 1988, tensions between the United States and Panama were extremely high with the Panamanian leader, Manuel Noriega, calling for the dissolution of the agreement that allowed the United States to have bases in his country. In December 1989 President George H. W. Bush activated the planning section for Operation Just Cause/Promote Liberty. Just Cause was the portion of the mission to depose Noriega and return Panama to democracy. Originally scheduled to begin at 0200 hrs. on 20 December, it actually kicked off at 2315 hrs when part of a Special Forces detachment that was waiting for the signal to begin was discovered above a gate above a Panamanian checkpoint. Just Cause was the first mission to have a very large contingent of Special Operations Forces on the ground. The units that were involved with the mission were as follows: Task Force Green (Delta Force), Task Force Black (7th SFG, 5th SFG, 3rd SFG, 4th PSYOP Group, the reinforced 1st Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division, and all three battalions of the 75th Rangers, and numerous other units from other forces such as the Navy SEALs, Marine Force Recon, and Air Force Combat Control Teams. Of the 23 US troops who died in the invasion four were Navy SEALs. The invasion was successful at deposing Noriega, but led to widespread looting and lawlessness in the following weeks.Panama Companies Sue U.S. for Damages. The New York Times. 21 July 1990. Persian Gulf War On August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded its neighbor Kuwait, The US and other nations around the world sent its forces to Saudi Arabia to protect the country and eventually liberate Kuwait. In October 1990, the 5th Special Forces Group was the first Special Forces unit into action. They deployed along the Saudi-Kuwait border with a Saudi Special Forces, they patrolled the border, setting up bases in border forts and had several firefights with Iraqi forces. They were the eyes and ears of the coalition force, they also provided outposts where Iraqi deserters could surrender, be interrogated and provided valuable intelligence. The 5th Special Forces continued their border activities until 10 February 1991 when they were replaced by lead elements from regular units. US Special forces also played a vital role in acting as liaison with Arab members of the coalition, every Arab unit went into action with Special Forces team with them, where displaying valor and courage on many occasions. They continued to play a role up to the war's end, carrying out missions behind enemy lines.Cawthorne, Nigel, The Mammoth Book of Inside the Elite Forces, Robinson, 2008 War on Terror War in Afghanistan =Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Afghanistan= U.S. Air Force Combat Controllers with Northern Alliance troops on horseback during the invasion of Afghanistan, 12 November 2001. Immediately after the September 11 attack on the United States, President George W. Bush instructed Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to come up with a plan to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan who harbored Al Qaeda. General Tommy Franks, then-commanding general of Central Command, initially proposed a conventional force invasion of Afghanistan with 60,000 troops. He told Bush and Rumsfeld that it would take six months to launch the campaign. Rumsfeld heatedly rejected this plan, demanding that troops be sent in immediately. Franks returned the next day with a plan to utilize special forces, which Bush approved. For the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, Task Force Dagger was established on 10 October 2001, the unit was built around the 5th SFG with helicopter support from the 160th SOAR, TF Dagger was assigned to northern Afghanistan and tasked with infiltrating ODA teams into Afghanistan to advise and support the commanders of the Northern Alliance. Task Force K-Bar was also established around a Naval Special Warfare Group consisting of SEAL Teams 2, 3, 8 and Green Berets from 1st Battalion 3rd SFG, the task force would primarily conduct special reconnaissance and site exploitation missions ‚Äì intelligence gathering at former enemy locations, some 3rd SFG ODAs were also given the Foreign Internal Defence and Unconventional Warfare role. The TFs were part of the CJSOTF (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force) under the overall leadership of General Tommy Franks, Coalition Forces Commander (CENTCOM) p. 25, p. 27 The Northern Alliance was outnumbered, outgunned, and undersupplied. It controlled only about 15 percent of Afghanistan. Senior U.S. commanders hoped at best that the Green Berets would boost Northern Alliance morale and help prevent the better-equipped Taliban forces from a further offensive until larger American forces could arrive. During the night of 18‚Äì19 October 2001, Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 595, a 12-man Green Beret team, plus two Air Force Combat Controllers, were airlifted from Karshi-Khanabad Air Base in Uzbekistan page 127ff more than across the Hindu Kush mountains in zero-visibility conditions. They rode aboard two SOAR MH-47E Chinook helicopters and were escorted by two MH-60L DAPs (Direct Action Penetrators). The Chinooks were refueled in-flight three times during the 11-hour mission, establishing a new world record for combat rotorcraft missions at the time. They linked up with the CIA and the Northern Alliance. They were greeted by CIA paramilitary officers from the Special Activities Division who had arrived only 10 days before. At about the same time, ODA 555 landed hundreds of miles south in the Panjshir Valley, and linked up with another Northern Alliance force. Within a few weeks the Northern Alliance, with assistance from the U.S. ground and air forces, captured several key cities from the Taliban.Berntsen and Pezzulla (2005), Jawbreaker On 20 October 2001, an element of ODA 595 guided in the first JDAM bomb from a B-52, impressing General Dostum and his Northern Alliance forces who soon used it for Psychological warfare ‚Äì taunted the Taliban over their radio frequencies. On 9 November 2001, ODA 595 and ODA 534 and the seven members of the CIA's Special Activities Division\\"Frontlines\\", 2 August 2002 assisted about 2000 members of the Northern Alliance who attacked and liberated Mazari Sharif on horseback, foot, pickup trucks, and BMP armored personnel carriers. On November 11, in the central north of Afghanistan, ODA 586 was advising General Daoud Khan outside the city of Taloqan and coordinating a batch of preparatory airstrikes when the General surprised everyone by launching an impromptu massed infantry assault on the Taliban holding the city. Before the first bomb could be dropped, the city fell. On 12 and 13 November, ODA 555 assisted the Northern Alliance forces in the capture of Kabul. On November 14, 2001, ODA 574 and Hamid Karzai inserted into Uruzgan Province via 4 MH-60K helicopters and later fought the Battle of Tarwinkot with a small force of guerrillas. On 23 November, ODA 586 assisted General Daoud Khan forces in the taking Kunduz. On 25 November, a headquarters element from 3rd Battalion, 5th SFG, along with British SBS and other US forces took part in the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi, on 27 November, during a CAS mission, 5 Green Berets were wounded by a misdirected JDAM. Various ODA's took part in the taking of Kandahar. On 5 December 2001, a 2,000lb GPS-guided bomb landed among the Green Berets from ODA 574, killing 3 members and wounding the rest of the team, over 20 of Karzai's militia were also killed and Karzai himself slightly wounded. ODB 570 and ODA 524 were immediately dispatched by helicopter to assist with the wounded and to eventually replace the fallen operators of ODA 574. ODA 572 and a CIA Jawbreaker team (small group of CIA SAD ground branch operators) were dispatched to eastern Afghanistan where they recruited some 2,500 to 3,000 into the Afghan Militia Force to take part in the Battle of Tora Bora. On December 20, following the battle, ODA 561 were inserted into the White Mountains to support ODA 572 in conducting sensitive site exploitation of the caves and to assist with recovering DNA samples from terrorist bodies. Time reported that on 4 January 2002, Green Beret SFC Scott Neil jumped out the back of an MH-53 half a mile from a suspected al-Qaeda compound, 140 miles south of Kabul. With just one-hour on scene time due to limited helicopter fuel, Neil rushed through AK-47 fire and overcame the al- Qaeda fighters; intelligence from the compound proved it to be an al-Qaeda way station, containing hundreds of fake passports to give terrorists new identities, and multiple computers, powered by car batteries and linked to satellite phones for internet connection. In March 2002, as part of Task Force K-Bar, ODAs from 3rd SFG took part in Operation Anaconda, at around midnight on March 2, Task Force Hammer (consisting of Special Forces A-teams Texas 14/ODA 594 and 450 Afghan Militia Fighters led by Commander Zia Lodin) left their base at Gardez to take part in the operation. They were to enter the Shahikot valley from the north, then they would assault through the villages of Serkhankheyl and Marzak, where intelligence indicated that the enemy was concentrated, and channel fleeing enemy into the Task Force Rakkasan blocking positions Several soldiers were injured when their truck overturned due to the poor condition of the road, they decided to use their headlights, even though they would lose the element of surprise. An AC-130 Gunship, callsign Grim 31, that was providing fire support and reconnaissance for the operation, spotted the convoy; and due to a problem with the aircraft's inertial navigation system the aircraft failed to identify the Column as friendly unit. Grim 31 engaged the convoy killing CWO Stanley Harriman and wounding two other Green Berets and Afghan militia. The main body of TF Hammer reached the startline at 0615 and waited for the preplanned aerial bombardment of previously identified terrorist positions that would last 55 minutes, however only 6 bombs were dropped because the second B-1B on its bombing run had a bomb stuck in the launch bay, while the third bomber waited for the B-1B to get permission to jettison the bomb and go around again, both planes and two F-15Es received orders to cease the bombardment, an order that may have been intended for Grim 31. Already demoralized from the lack of air support TF Hammer were raked with mortar fire from al-Qaeda fighters that had been registered in advance of the operation, causing the Afghan militia to suffer over 40 casualties. TF Hammer attack stalled before it even entered the valley, due to heavy small arms fire and mortar fire, they also lacked close air support, which had been assigned to TF Anvil on the other side of the ridge; CIA intelligence also revealed that the al-Qaeda terrorists were in the peaks of the mountains rather than in the villages TF Hammer was supposed to assault. These setbacks caused the AMF to scatter and refuse to advance any further, however TF Hammers did distract the enemy forces from TF Rakkasan deployment. TF Rakkasan and the Green Berets of TF Hammer fought all day with the AFO teams calling in continuous airstrikes on al-Qaeda positions. The valley was eventually cleared by March 12.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.52, p.55-57 US Special Forces in Gayan Valley, eastern Afghanistan, 19 July 2003. Also in March 2002, CJTF-180 took over command and control of SOF forces in Afghanistan. On May 19, a Green Beret from Support Company, 2nd Battalion, 19th SFG, was killed while on patrol in Paktita. Later in 2002, CJSOFT became a single integrated command under the broader CJTF-180 that commanded all US forces assigned to OEF-A, it was built around an Army Special Forces Group (often manned by National Guard units) and SEAL teams, in September 2002, the 20th SFG and 2nd Battalion 7th SFG has assumed the role of CJSOTF-Afghanistan allowing the 3rd SFG to be part of the invasion of Iraq. Until the arrival of General Stanley McChrystal in 2009, counterinsurgency was focused on Direct Action against insurgents on a localised level and often led by Green Beret teams, who were also recruiting and training Afghan Militia Forces to provide security in their area of operations. The ODAs were assigned either an offensive or Direct Action role which would have them operation in far-flung provinces with locally recruited militia, or they would be assigned to an FID (Foreign Internal Defence) detail which saw them partnered with Afghan Army battalions in a training and mentoring role. In 2007, the Green Berets FID role succeeded in creating the first two Afghan Commando units. Green Beret ODAs often worked closely with the Romanian special forces, they took part in joint patrols, deploying hybrid ODAs of both Romanian and American soldiers. On January 25, 2008, a small element of U.S. and Afghan National Army soldiers led by SSG Robert James Miller was conducting a combat reconnaissance patrol through the Gowardesh Valley, Kunar Province, when they engaged a force of 15‚Äì20 insurgents occupying prepared fighting positions. After calling in close air support, Staff Sergeant Miller led a small squad forward to conduct battle damage assessment when over 100 insurgents ambushed the squad, Miller displayed extraordinary valour by drawing fire away from his squad, killing 10 insurgents in the process. His actions cost him his life, but he saved the lives of 7 members of his team and 15 Afghan National Army soldiers, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. In September 2008, a Green Beret ODA conducted a joint operation with 1 Troop 3 Squadron SASR in northwest Uruzgan Province, the operation was designed to lure insurgents into a trap using a ground convoy of five special forces GMV trucks as bait. SASR sniper teams, who inserted on foot the night before as part of two cut-off groups to overwatch the patrol. The plan worked, a small group of insurgents approached the vehicles, intent on ambushing the convoy, they were engaged by the SASR snipers. Minutes later a Toyota Hilux appeared carrying a number of armed insurgents, they were engaged and killed and a second vehicle, a van, arrived carrying 3 insurgents were engaged by the sniper teams until they spotted a female non-combatant who was used as a human shield by the surviving insurgent, the insurgent was eventually killed with no harm to the woman, a total of 13 insurgents were killed. In the mid-afternoon on September 2, in the Ana Kalay Valley, following a similar ruse that killed 7 insurgents, 39 Green Berets, SASR soldiers and Afghan Police on five GMVs were returning to an American patrol base when they were engaged by small arms and RPG fire from four firing points, starting the Battle of Khaz Oruzgan. One Green Beret was seriously wounded, a U.S JTAC called in a flight of F/A-18 Hornets that conducted gun runs against the insurgents and returned to drop JDAMs on a group of insurgents, as the patrol moved with their vehicles more troops were hit, they eventually arrived at the patrol base, of the 13 wounded- 7 were SASR soldiers and a Green Beret was killed; one SASR soldier was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle. Afghan commandos of the 6th Commando Kandak in Wardak Province,Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.147 October 9, 2011. In early 2010, Brigadier General Scott Miller took command of CJSOTF- Afghanistan and assigned virtually all SOF in the theatre to a new counterinsurgency role that would become known as the ALP/VSO Program (Afghan Local Police/Village Stability Operations), the SOF in Afghanistan were organised into battalion level SOTF (Special Operations Task Forces) each with a geographic area of responsibility. 1st SFG would have responsibility for southwestern Afghanistan, other Green Berets would have responsibilities in southern and eastern Afghanistan; In March 2012, Green Beret ODA teams suffered several casualties to Green on Blue attacks. On 13 September 2011 an ODA team from 1st Battalion 10th SFG, partnered with Hungarian Special Operations and Afghan National Police, carried out an operation to apprehend known insurgents in Maiden Shahr District, Wardak Province ‚Äì an area traditionally used by insurgents to move undetected by opposing coalition forces. The main body of the force patrolled through a village from the north- east, whilst the ODA's team sergeant, MSG Danial Adams, led a small element, which convoyed through the mountainous area on the outskirts of a village via ATVs to provide necessary over watch and to facilitate radio communications from the high ground to the west. After approximately three hours of searching, they were unable to locate their target, so they began to withdraw from the village; it was at that time that they lost their aerial reconnaissance assets, which were pulled away to assist coalition forces in other parts of the country. Once the main body was clear of the village, Adams and the rest of his over-watch element began moving south on their ATVs to the designated link-up point. Adams led the way, followed by SFC Richard Harris and three other team members. Just as they passed a small cluster of buildings at the edge of the village, they ran into a well-planned and emplaced ambush consisting of more than 25 insurgents armed with AK-47's, light machine guns, PKM heavy machine guns, and RPG-7 rocket propelled grenades. The insurgents were in staggered positions along the ambush line across approximately 180 meters. MSG Danial Adams was killed during the initial moments of the ambush whilst attempting to accelerate through the kill zone with his team, SFC Richard Harris spent the rest of the battle aggressively attacking the insurgents whilst guarding the body of his team sergeant at significant risk to his own life; reinforcements were brought into the battle and F-16 strafing runs were carried out, after the dropping of a 500lb bomb, the combined force left the battle. For his actions during the battle, Harris was eventually awarded the Silver Star. =Operation Freedom's Sentinel= Following the Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan at the end of 2014, the War in Afghanistan continued with 12,000 U.S. and NATO troops are deployed in Afghanistan as part of NATOs Resolute Support Mission whose purpose is to train, advise and assist Afghan government forces against anti-government forces and to conduct counter-terrorist missions. US forces in Afghanistan are deployed under Operation Freedom's SentineL. The Green Berets took part in the Battle of Kunduz, helping Afghan forces retake the city by October 2015 after it fell to Taliban insurgents. Green Berets have also been assisting Afghan forces in Helmand Province, where on the January 5, 2016, during a major operation aimed at reclaiming territory held by the Taliban, Staff Seargent Matthew McClintock of A Company, 1st Battalion, 19th SFG was killed by small arms fire during an hours long battle in the Marjah district. Two other U.S. troops and four Afghan soldiers were injured. The coalition conducted 12 airstrikes in the area with a variety of aircraft, including F-16 fighter jets and an AC-130 gunship. Two HH-60 Pave Hawk medevac helicopters responded to evacuate casualties, one was waved off and left the scene safely, but the second landed and its main rotor blade was damaged when the helicopter hit a wall. Green Berets of the 10th SFG memorialize two comrades who were killed in action during the Battle of Boz Qandahari on November 2‚Äì3, 2016, during a memorial held at Kunduz Airfield in Afghanistan on November 7, 2016. On May 26, 2016, Green Berets supported about 80 soldiers of the Afghan 3rd Special Operations Battalion whose mission was to clear insurgents from Elbak, Kandahar province. The goal was to clear the road from Kandahar through Elbak to Tarin Kowt and allow an 800-man Afghan army convoy to deliver troops and supplies to Tarin Kowt. Green Berets called in three airstrikes by U.S. drones on Taliban insurgents near the landing zone, killing seven and wounding others. The mission had mixed results. The Taliban reoccupied the area and the convoy barely made any progress, however the operation interrupted the Taliban's nightly routine of bomb-planting. A week later, the Afghan commandos removed 18 booby-trap bombs from the road and made their way slowly through Elbak and further north. On August 23, a US soldier from A Company, 3rd battalion, 1st SFG, was killed by an IED while another was wounded along with six Afghans during a foot patrol near Lashkar Gah, Helmand Province. On October 4, 2016, a US soldier from B Company, 2nd Battalion, 10th SFG was killed by a roadside bomb blast in Achin, Nangarhar province. He was on a patrol with Afghan forces during an operation against ISIL-KP militants. This marked the first time a U.S. serviceman was killed in combat against IS militants in the country. On October 17, DEA agents, supported by a US Army Green Beret A-team and Afghan counter-narcotic units conducted a warranted search in a remote village in Farah province. After a brief gunfight with insurgents near the compound outside the remote village, they discovered a \\"superlab\\" belonging to the Hadimama drug trafficking network that was led by two suspected Taliban commanders and facilitators. The team seized of drugs (12.5 tons of morphine base, 6.4 tons of heroin base, 134 kilograms of opium, 129 kilograms of crystal heroin and 12 kilograms of hashish). They also seized nine motorcycles and five AK-47 rifles. It was reported that the superlab was apparently a first of its kind seen by DEA agents in Afghanistan. Officials said it was the \\"largest known seizure of heroin in Afghanistan, if not the world.\\" In the early hours of November 3, 2016, a joint raid with Afghan and NATO troops that targeted top Taliban commanders took place in Kunduz Province. After they were surrounded and came under enemy fire, the Afghans requested foreign airstrikes ‚Äì despite Afghan forces providing initial air support, U.S. aircraft carried out the airstrikes. Two Green Berets from 2nd Battalion, 10th SFG were killed and 4 others wounded and 4 Afghan special forces troops were also killed and 7 were wounded. A Kunduz provincial police spokesman said that as of Friday morning (November 4), there were 24 civilian fatalities, including women and children, as many as 10 others were injured during the operation, which occurred in the village of Buze Kandahari, a Taliban-dominated area. A Kunduz police chief said the two senior Taliban commanders who were the target of the raid were killed in the fighting along with 63 other insurgents. Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Philippines OEF-P was established in 2002 to conduct what SOCOM history terms \\"full spectrum embedding and engagement\\"-focusing on long-term partnered operations with Philippine police and Army special operations and intelligence units as well as local units with the necessary skills to counter ASG and JI. Much of this work has fallen to 1st SFG. SOCPAC deployed a Joint Task Force-510 (JTF-510) to Zamboanga City on Mindanao, Philippines in January 2002 to prepare for the introduction of forces onto Basilan. From February to July 2002, 10 ODAs and 3 ODBs (Operational Detachment Bravos) of 1st SFG provided training, advice, and assistance to 15 Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Infantry Battalions. Their mission on Basilan was to work through, with, and by AFP units to destroy the ASG organization on the island. The ODAs were prohibited from conducting combat operations and performing advisory tasks below the battalion level, the ODAs focused on denying ASG sanctuary by preparing the AFP to improve security operations by controlling lines of communication, improving the infrastructure for the local populace through Civil Affairs, and bolstering the government in the eyes of citizens through information operations. After completing operations by late summer 2002, JTF-510 departed Zamboanga. On 2 October 2002, a bombing at an open-air market outside the gate of Camp Enrile Malagutay in Zamboanga City killed a U.S. Special Forces soldier from A Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st SFG. In 2003‚Äì04, SOCPAC supported the AFP by training a larger number of Filipino forces. Again, 1st SFG deployed two successive force packages, consisting of one ODB and 5 ODAs, to conduct Security Assistance during 2003, and a third force package in 2004 of one ODB and 3 ODAs. In total the ODAs trained 5 AFP army and one AFP marine battalions. During the same period, 1st Battalion of 1st SFG continued training the Filipino Counterterrorist force, preparing and outfitting an additional two Light Reaction Companies (LRCs). ODAs from 1st Battalion of 1st SFG also assisted in the design of a Joint Special Operations Group (JSOG), including AFP air force rotary wing lift assets. On 30 June 2004, a U.S. Special Forces soldier from 2nd Battalion, 1st SFG, was killed in a non- hostile incident in Manila. SOCPAC also introduced Operations/Intelligence Fusion Teams (O/IFTs) to work with various organizations in AFP's Southern Command. The O/IFTs provided advice and assistance on collection priorities and force employment at division and brigade. Beginning in 2004, 1st Battalion 1st SFG provided two ODAs continuously to serve as O/IFTs, both to the newly created JSOG and to Filipino 6th Infantry Division in Mindanao. In the summer of 2005, terrorists from the ASG and JI had moved from Mindanao to Sulu where they sought refuge. SOCPAC and Southern Command pushed for a significant expansion of American assistance to the Filipino Counterterrorist effort, but being that Sulu was predominantly inhabited by Muslims and was the site where Islam was introduced to the Philippines, many members of both the Philippine and US governments believed that introducing American forces onto Sulu would have been met with intense resistance. Based on a PACOM assessment recommending such a deployment, the Secretary of Defense approved a second iteration of OEF-P to combat terrorism in the Southern Command Area of Responsibility, specifically on Sulu. SOCPAC established a larger JSOTF in Zamboanga and deployed aforce package to the island of Sulu, conducting operations based on the Basilan model. Using that template, SOCPAC deployed one ODB, 5 ODAs to Sulu to advise and assist AFP units in their effort to capture key terrorists. From October 2005 to July 2006, JSOTF-P units assisted Task Force (TF) Comet-the AFP command on Sulu-in setting conditions to deny terrorist sanctuary. ODAs advised their partner army and marine infantry battalions en route and area security to facilitate Filipino sponsored medical, veterinary, and engineer civilian action programs, along with various population engagement activities. These combined efforts succeeded in separating the terrorists from the population. On 27 October 2007, a U.S. Special Forces soldier from 2nd Battalion, 1st SFG was killed in an accidental drowning incident at Lake Seit in the southern Philippines. On 29 September 2009, a roadside bomb killed two U.S. Special Forces soldiers from 3rd battalion, 1st SFG and a Philippine Marine on Jolo island. Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Horn of Africa During December 2002 and January 2003, Special Operation Detachment ‚Äì Central (SOD-C) arrived to augment Joint Special Operations Task Force ‚Äì Horn of Africa (JSOTF-HOA). The SOD concept was new and consisted of experienced National Guard Special Forces Officers and NCOs who served as the JSOTF's core staff. Besides the SOD-C, JSOTF-HOA included Air Force Special Operations Detachment-Alpha (AFSOD-A), an SF detachment, a SEAL platoon, and a Naval Special Warfare (NSW) rigid inflatable boat (RIB) detachment. In November 2006, 20th SFG Headquarters deployed to round out the Special Operations Command and Control Element ‚Äì Horn of Africa (SOCCE-HOA) staff for two years. This initiative allowed SOCCE-HOA to better accomplish its missions. Iraq War =Invasion of Iraq= Planning for the Operation Iraqi Freedom began in December 2001; in 2002 several teams of 10th SFG and CIA SAD operatives were infiltrated into Iraqi Kurdistan in advance of hostilities. They were based in the Harir valley outside Irbil and tasked to develop ground truth intelligence while organising and training the Peshmerga; they were also there to monitor Ansar al-Islam and plan for a future operation against them. For the 2003 invasion of Iraq, CJSOTF-West (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-West/Task Force Dagger) was formed around the 5th SFG, their ODAs were tasked with two core missions: the first ‚Äì to counter the SCUD TELs and by denying the Iraqi military the use of potential launch sites and the second ‚Äì provide both intelligence-gathering and screening function in support of conventional forces to build up an accurate picture of Iraqi force dispositions in western Iraq. The Green Beret ODAs were deployed under the command and control of ODBs (Operational Detachment Bravo) which operated as roving AOBs (Advanced Operating Bases), these AOBs provided a mobile resupply function using their modified M1078 Light Medium Transport Vehicles which meant that the ODA patrols could operate for extended periods in enemy territory before linking up with a fighting patrol that would be escorting the AOBs for combat resupply. The 5th SFG was assigned responsibility for two sectors of western Iraq-the western and southern JSOAs (Joint Special Operations Areas-also known as Ops Boxes), one element termed FOB 51 (Operating Base 51) and commanded by AOB 520 and AOB 530, was composed of ODAs from 1st Battalion 5th SFG, they were stationed out of H-5 Air Base and were responsible for western Iraq. 2nd and 3rd Battalions deployed from Ali Al Salem Air Base as FOB 52 and 53 and were assigned to southern Iraq; attached to all teams were Special Tactics airmen from the 23rd Special Tactics Squadron to guide in close air support and manage the airspace above the ODA teams. A company element from the 19th SFG was attached to TF Dagger as were several regular and National Guard infantry companies to provide FOB security and to act as a QRF. As the prospect of war grew A company, 1st Battalion, 19th SFG, were tasked with liaison roles supporting conventional forces: ODA 911 and ODA 913 were to support the I MEF; ODA 914 was divided into two elements, one supporting the 3rd Infantry Division with ODA 916 and the other supporting British Forces; ODA 915 was attached to the 101st Airborne Division; and ODA 912 was tasked with providing PSD for General Harrell, the commander of CFSOCC (Combined Forces Special Operations Component Command). Responsibility for special operations in northern Iraq was assigned to CJSOTF-North (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-North/Task Force Viking) was formed around the 10th SFG, working alongside them would 3rd Battalion 3rd SFG. They were supported by the 123rd Special Tactics Squadron, 173rd Airborne Brigade and several companies of 2nd Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division. The original plan called for TF Viking to support the 4th Infantry Division advance from Turkey towards Baghdad but the mission was cancelled when Turkey denied staging rights to the US. Viking was assigned the task of keeping 13 Iraqi armoured and infantry divisions in the north from reinforcing Baghdad, the 10th SFG was to organise the Kurdish Peshmerga to support them. Just as in Afghanistan, SF were the first military units in Iraq after the initial entry of JSOC (Joint Special Operations Command) and the CIA.Bob Woodward, Plan of Attack, Simon and Schuster, 2004.Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War inside Iraq, Mike Tucker, Charles Faddis, 2008, The Lyons Press At H-Hour, Bravo and Charlie companies of 1st Battalion, 5th SFG, crossed the Kuwait border began carrying out operations in western Iraq ‚Äì joining up with the British and Australian SAS and Delta Force elements to secure H-3 Air Base, as well as securing Ar Rutbah; the 5th SFG also carried out operations in support of forces moving on Karbala Nasiriyah and Al Diwaniyah. On 21 March, ODA 554 of Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion 5th SFG entered Iraq and began carrying out operations in southern Iraq ‚Äì mainly supporting British forces in the seizure of Basra and surrounding locations, until relieved by G squadron, 22 SAS Regiment. Bravo company carried out reconnaissance operations around Najaf On March 22, 2003, after a number of delays, the majority of 2nd and 3rd battalions, 10th SFG, were airlifted into northern Iraq, with the rest arriving the following day, marking the beginning of operations in northern Iraq ‚Äì On March 28, 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG, with Kurdish Peshmerga elements, took part in Operation Viking Hammer against the terrorist group Ansar al-Islam, killing 300 terrorists-largely and discovering evidence of al-Qaeda trying to produce chemical weapons. On 6 April 2003, ODA 391 and ODA 392 from the 3rd SFG and ODA 044 from 10th SFG with about 150 Kurdish fighters were the main force involved in the Battle of Debecka Pass, whilst other ODAs 051, 055, 056 and other ODAs from both groups with Kurdish forces took the town of Ayn Sifni ‚Äì opening the road to Mosul. On 9 April, nine ODAs from FOB 103 encircled Kirkuk after fierce fighting to capture the ridges overlooking the approaches to the city, the earlier capture of the nearby city of Tuz had largely broken the will of the Iraqi Army and only the Fedayeen remained in Kirkuk, a week later the 173rd Airborne took over responsibility for the city and secured it. After several days of heavy airstrikes, FOB 102 and their Peshmerga allies took Mosul unopposed and were relieved by 3rd Battalion, 3rd SFG, conventional Army and Marine forces. Along with CIA/SAD officers, the Green Berets led one of the most successful campaigns in Iraq, particularly the 10th SFG along with its Kurdish allies defeated six Iraqi Army Divisions with limited air support and no SF soldiers were killed. The joint Kurdish-Special Forces units killed over one-thousand Iraqi Army soldiers and captured hundreds more.All Necessary Means: Employing CIA operatives in a Warfighting Role Alongside Special Operations Forces, Colonel Kathryn Stone, Professor Anthony R. Williams (Project Advisor), United States Army War College (USAWC), 7 April 2003 =Post-invasion= In May 2003, CJSOTF-AP (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Arabian Peninsula) was established to replace Task Forces Dagger, Viking and the Naval Special Operations Task Group that had commanded the SOF in the invasion. Since 2003, CJSOTF-AP was based around the 5th SFG and 10th SFG which deployed for 7-month rotations, much of CJSOTF-AP was focused on the core special forces skill set of training and advising local Iraqi forces, these units included the ICTF (Iraqi Counterrorism Force) and the ISOF. When foreign fighters and al-Qaeda terrorists began to filter into the country from Syria and Iran, the Iraqi police was fragmented and poorly supported were to be the frontline against the insurgency, police training was carried out by contractors whilst ODAs were paired with local Iraqi SWAT units to teach them tactical skills. Other Iraqi SOF were established with the assistance of the Green Berets including a SOCOM-style command. The 1st ISOF Brigade would eventually be formed to command the ICTF, 36th Commando Battalion, Reece Battalion, Iraqi Special Warfare School and a support battalion. Similarly, an Iraqi Police special operations command and the Emergency Response Brigade was raised from local Iraqi police SWAT elements, consisting of six SWAT battalions. Special Forces along with Iraqi Army forces conduct an air assault in-route to their mission objective to capture terrorists of a known insurgent force, September 2007. In 2004, prior to the Second Battle of Fallujah, the 5th SFG with JSOC elements, SEALs and Marine Force Recon were heavily involved in shaping operations prior to the November 7 D-DAY when coalition forces entered the city. The SOF shaping included sophisticated feints to mislead the insurgents as to the direction of the final assault, close target reconnaissance and direct-action missions where a logistics node or IED factory was targeted. In addition, Green Berets from the 5th SFG and Delta Force operators were deployed in small teams (most consisting of just three or four operators), to embed with Marine and Army infantry units. These teams followed the earlier model established during the First Battle of Fallujah ‚Äì by providing advanced communications, sniping and assault experience and mentoring the soldiers and Marines fighting house to house through the city. The ICTF was under CJSOTF-AP command until 2006 when it was handed over to the Iraqis under the newly established CTS (Iraqi Counterrorism Service). In the years after the invasion, the Green berets mentored the elite units in the Iraqi Army. Following George W. Bush sanctioning a new directive in November 2006, to allow US forces in Iraq to kill or capture Iranian nationals if they engaged in targeting coalition forces, US commanders formed Task Force 17, based around a Green Berets headquarters group, whose missions were called CII (Counter Iranian Influence); and Green Beret ODA's were selected to be part of it. The Green Berets would become actively involved against the Iranian-backed Special Groups, TF-17 relied a good deal on the Green Berets mentoring teams with the ISOF, the Green Berets placed ODA's in outfits such as the INIS and the Iraqi commando brigade. The ODA's consisted of 20 men and became ‚Äî during the course of 2007 ‚Äî the key to coalition operations in provinces such as Dhi Ghar or Maysan, the teams ensured that operations in the Shia militant strongholds had an Iraqi face to them ‚Äî something of great symbolic importance to the US relationship with the Iraqi government. Green Berets and Polish GROM conducted Operation Jackal against insurgents in Diwaniyah in 2007. During May and June 2007, many Shia arrest operations were conducted by the British SAS and TF-17s Green Berets and Iraqi commandos led to Muqtada al-Sadr to initially flee to Iran, and in August he declared a Mahdi Army ceasefire with the coalition.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 , p.205-207, p.213, p.227-228, p.250 Insurgency in the Maghreb and Sahel Green Berets have been deployed throughout the Sahara/Sahel region and western Africa, particularly on FID missions. =Pan Sahel Initiative= In 2002, the United States created the Pan Sahel Initiative (PSI) which was aimed at counter- terrorism and enhancing regional peace and security in Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad. Green Berets from the 10th SFG attached to Special Operations Command Europe (SOCEUR) of the United States European Command (EUCOM) deployed to Niger and Mali and supervised anti-terror exercises in the Sahara Desert.Gegout, Catherine, Why Europe Intervenes in Africa: Security Prestige and the Legacy of Colonialism, C Hurst & Co Publishers Ltd, 2017, by Alexander, Yonah, Richardson Tyler B., Terror on the High Seas: From Piracy to Strategic Challenge, Praeger, 2009, =Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Trans Sahara= In June 2005, the United States replaced the PSIReveron, Derek S., Murer, Jeffery StevensonFlashpoints in the War on Terrorism, Routledge, 2013, with the launch of the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative (TSCTI/TSCTP) for Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Chad, Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Senegal and Nigeria,Morgan, M. Woolsey, R. James, The Impact of 9/11 on Politics and War: The Day that Changed Everything?, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009, with the support from the Department of Defense's Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Trans Sahara (OEF-TS). The principle SOF unit for the TSCTP/TSCTI was the 10th SFG, which was joined by the 20th SFG, as the 3rd SFG (who had regional responsibility for Africa) was assigned to Iraq. This meant the Green Berets in the region lacked the cultural and language prerequisites that the 3rd SFG had, and so the Green Berets were forced into a mission that they, like the targeted countries were \\"learning on the job\\".Davis, John, Terrorism in Africa: The Evolving Front in the War on Terror Lexington Books, 2010, In 2005 and 2007, US Army Special Forces and US Army Rangers, along with contingents from other units participated in the JCET's Flintlock Exercises, where they provided training experience both for American troops and for troops of African countries. Small numbers of European troops were also involved in these exercises.Francis, David J, US Strategy in Africa: AFRICOM, Terrorism and Security Challenges (Routledge Global Security Studies) , Routledge Global Security Studies, 2010, The first test of the TSCTI, which \\"kicked off\\" the Saharan counterterrorism initiative was Flintlock 2005, lasted from 6‚Äì26 June 2005, and was designated by the Bush administration as the largest American military exercise in Africa since World War II. 700 special forces participants, supported by an additional 2,100 troops from 9 North and West African states. The opening phase provided a terrorist scenario in order to train 3,000 ill-equipped Saharan troops in counterterrorist techniques designed to share intelligence, prevent terrorist interdiction, and protect/patrol the borders. In April 2007, Green Berets went to Niger for the first part of Flintlock 2007; The TSCTP also involved smaller, regular training exercises conducted by US Army Special Forces personnel throughout the region. =Operation Juniper Shield= At some point in 2013, Operation Enduring Freedom ‚Äì Trans Sahara was rebadged as Operation Juniper Shield.Shaw, Ian G. R. Predator Empire: Drone Warfare and Full Spectrum Dominance Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2016, ABC News reported that the Green Berets are also advising and assisting Niger's military to build up their fighting capability to counter the terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS. In September 2014, the Huffington post reported that members of the 19th SFG were deployed to Camp Ram Ram in Morocco as part of Operation Juniper Shield. On July 1, 2015, Army Times reported that the 3rd SFG will begin shifting its area of operations to Africa, with its focus primarily on northern and western Africa, the group expects to complete its transition out of the Middle East and Central Asia by summer 2016, as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down. Colonel Robert Wilson, the group commander, said his group \\"will gradually replace 10th [SFG] mission on the continent.\\" On February 2, 2017, during a ‚Äúroutine administrative movement,‚Äù a Green Beret from 1st Battalion, 3rd SFG was killed and another soldier injured in a vehicle accident in Niger; according to the Stars and Stripes report Niger is a hub for special operations forces to train partner nations in north and west Africa to counter extremist groups and militants such as Boko Haram in Nigeria. On October 4, 2017, Green Berets of the 3rd SFG were ambushed. Time reported that a joint team of 12 Green Berets and 30 Nigerien troops were conducting a two-day reconnaissance mission along the Niger-Mali border. The target of their operation was Ibrahim Dondou Chefou, who had attended a high-level meeting of regional leaders from the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) days earlier. After searching a deserted campsite and speaking with elders from the village of Tongo Tongo, seeking intelligence on the terrorist operative, they began a drive back to base. Travelling in mostly unarmored pick-up trucks, they were ambushed by around 50 ISGS terrorists. During the engagement, four Green Berets were killed and two were wounded, and five Nigeriens were killed and eight wounded. Twenty-one terrorists were killed. Operation Inherent Resolve Deir ez- Zor campaign in Syria, October 11, 2018 Since Operation Inherent Resolve began, U.S. airstrikes have been supported by Green Beret adviser teams, helping stop the advances of ISIL. Green Berets from the 5th SFG deployed to Jordan in support of OIR, several news outlets reported they were at the Prince Faisal Air Base in Al-Jafr working for a CIA program to train moderate Syrian fighters. On November 4, 2016, a small convoy of carrying Green Berets were returning to the base after a training exercise when a Jordanian guard, after waving the first vehicle through the entry control point at the base, then opened fire on the second vehicle killing 2 Green Berets, U.S. troops from the vehicle behind opened fire, another Green Beret was killed but a fourth, who was wounded, shot the Jordanian, severely wounding him. On January 8, 2017, a Green Beret assigned to 2nd Battalion 5th SFG, was killed in a non- combat-related incident in Jordan. Lord's Resistance Army insurgency The United States had been involved clandestinely in the Lord's Resistance Army insurgency since at least 2008; President Barack Obama deployed forces here in October 2011, the deployment is known as Operation Observant Compass. In March 2017, NBC News reported that Green Berets have been ordered to \\"apprehend or remove\\" Joseph Kony, one of the world's most notorious warlords from the battlefield, along with his top commanders. With about 80 military personnel and several dozen support personnel they were tasked with finding around 150 LRA fighters in an area of operations the size of California; carrying out missions (specifically patrols) in the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Uganda. The cooperation between U.S. special forces and the UPDF has led to notable successes: In January 2015, Green Berets were present after Dominic Ongwen turned himself in to authorities; previously in October 2012, an Invisible Children, Inc. program that encourages defections from the group and the rehabilitation of former fighters and escaped abductees resulted in notable defections, including several bodyguards; the LRA's \\"chief intelligence officer\\" who walked for four days from Sudan into CAR, was handed over to the UPDF with U.S. special forces present. LtCol Matt Maybouer, the commander of the operation said that \\"U.S. soldiers are not engaged in direct combat;\\" Green Beret teams conducting patrols carryout zone reconnaissance: a coordinated search for recent LRA activity. When they find it, the teams follow the trails, tracking the fighters for days across miles of uninhabited wilderness until they make contact. Matching these generic terrain-feature descriptions to specific GPS markers enabled SOCAFRICA to build a map of the area. The results enable the Green Berets to anticipate LRA movements. Commanders have used this knowledge to carry out operations that have sharply reduced the remnants of the LRA. Operation Atlantic Resolve On 29 March 2017, the Department of Defence reported that Green Berets from 1st Battalion 10th SFG were deployed to Europe to take part in exercise Allied Spirit VI-a multinational training exercise involving military personnel from Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Germany, Italy, Macedonia, Kosovo, Latvia, the Netherlands, Slovenia, UK and US at the JMRC in Germany, the exercise involved special operations and conventional forces with the aim to increase their effectiveness and/particularly to increase the effectiveness of special operations forces in working together while bolstering the capabilities of partner nations within US European Command's area of responsibility. The Green Berets provided their advise and assist training/skills, whilst working with Estonian Special Operations Task Group troops and Macedonian special operations troops. US Army Major Robert Temple, the special operations force cell planner at the JMRC said that ‚ÄúThe primary purpose of this exercise is providing a venue for the 1st Latvian Brigade to train in a Joint Task Force environment and increase their interoperability with both U.S. units as well as other multinational forces.‚Äù The exercise is being conducted as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve. Women in the Green Berets In 1981 Capt. Kathleen Wilder became the first woman to qualify for the Green Berets. She was told she had failed a field exercise just before graduation, but she filed a sex discrimination complaint, and it was determined that she \\"had been wrongly denied graduation.\\" In 2020 the first woman actually joined the Green Berets.https://www.upi.com/amp/Defense-News/2020/07/09/First-female-Green- Beret-graduates-Army-Special-Forces-course/2091594314705/ References External links * Category:History of the United States Army Category:Special forces units and formations in the United States Army ","title":"History of the United States Army Special Forces"},{"id":"34045015","text":"As long as humans have experienced pain, they have given explanations for its existence and sought soothing agents to dull or cease the painful sensation. Archaeologists have uncovered clay tablets dating back as far as 5,000 BC which reference the cultivation and use of the opium poppy to bring joy and cease pain. In 800 BC, the Greek writer Homer wrote in his epic, The Odyssey, of Telemachus, a man who used opium to soothe his pain and forget his worries.Booth, Martin. Opium a History. London: Simon & Schuster, 1996. Print. While some cultures researched analgesics and allowed or encouraged their use, others perceived pain to be a necessary, integral sensation. Physicians of the 19th century used pain as a diagnostic tool, theorizing that a greater amount of personally perceived pain was correlated to a greater internal vitality, and as a treatment in and of itself, inflicting pain on their patients to rid the patient of evil and unbalanced humors.Meldrum, Marcia. \\"A History of Pain Management.\\" Opioids : Past, Present and Future. Journal of the American Medical Association. Web. 08 Nov. 2011. This article focuses both on the history of how pain has been perceived across time and culture, but also how malleable an individual's perception of pain can be due to factors like situation, their visual perception of the pain, and previous history with pain.  Historical theories   Early theories  Bust of Aristotle Because of the only relatively recent discovery of neurons and how they conduct and interpret signals, including sensations such as pain, within the body, various theories have been proposed as to the causes of pain and its role or function. Even within seemingly limited groups, such as the ancient Greeks, there were competing theories as to the root cause of pain. Aristotle did not include a sense of pain when he enumerated the five senses; he, like Plato before him, saw pain and pleasure not as sensations but as emotions (\\"passions of the soul\\"). Alternatively, Hippocrates believed that pain was caused by an imbalance in the vital fluids of a human. At this time, neither Aristotle nor Hippocrates believed that the brain had any role to play in pain processing but rather implicated the heart as the central organ for the sensation of pain.Linton. Models of Pain Perception. Elsevier Health, 2005. Print.  Middle ages  In the 11th century, Avicenna theorized that there were a number of feeling senses including touch, pain and titillation.  Pain during the Renaissance  Portrait of Ren√© Descartes Even just prior to the scientific Renaissance in Europe, pain was not well understood and it was theorized that pain existed outside of the body, perhaps as a punishment from God, with the only management treatment being prayer. Again, even within the confined group of religious, practicing Christians, more than one theory arose. Alternatively, pain was also theorized to exist as a test or trial on a person. In this case, pain was inflicted by God onto person to reaffirm their faith, or in the example of Jesus, to lend legitimacy and purpose to a trial through suffering. In his 1664 Treatise of Man, Ren√© Descartes theorized that the body was more similar to a machine, and that pain was a disturbance that passed down along nerve fibers until the disturbance reached the brain. This theory transformed the perception of pain from a spiritual, mystical experience to a physical, mechanical sensation meaning that a cure for such pain could be found by researching and locating pain fibers within the bodies rather than searching for an appeasement for god. This also moved the center of pain sensation and perception from the heart to the brain. Descartes proposed his theory by presenting an image of a man's hand being struck by a hammer. In between the hand and the brain, Descartes described a hollow tube with a cord beginning at the hand and ending at a bell located in the brain. The blow of the hammer would induce pain in the hand, which would pull the cord in the hand and cause the bell located in the brain to ring, indicating that the brain had received the painful message. Researchers began to pursue physical treatments such as cutting specific pain fibers to prevent the painful signal from cascading to the brain.  Specificity theory  animal spirits to flow from a cavity (F) into the muscles causing them to flinch from the stimulus, turn the head and eyes toward the affected body part, and move the hand and turn the body protectively. The specificity theory, which states that pain is \\"a specific sensation, with its own sensory apparatus independent of touch and other senses,\\" emerged in the nineteenth century, but had been prefigured by the work of Avicenna and Descartes. Scottish anatomist Charles Bell proposed in 1811 that there exist different kinds of sensory receptor, each adapted to respond to only one stimulus type. Online reprint: In 1839 Johannes M√ºller, having established that a single stimulus type (e.g., a blow, electric current) can produce different sensations depending on the type of nerve stimulated, hypothesized that there is a specific energy, peculiar to each of five nerve types that serve Aristotle's five senses, and that it is the type of energy that determines the type of sensation each nerve produces. He considered feelings such as itching, pleasure, pain, heat, cold and touch to be varieties of the single sense he called \\"feeling and touch.\\" M√ºller's doctrine killed off the ancient idea that nerves carry actual properties or incorporeal copies of the perceived object, marking the beginning of the modern era of sensory psychology, and prompted others to ask, do the nerves that evoke the different qualities of touch and feeling have specific characteristics? Filippo Pacini had isolated receptors in the nervous system which detect pressure and vibrations in 1831. Georg Meissner and Rudolf Wagner described receptors sensitive to light touch in 1852; and Wilhelm Krause found a receptor that responds to gentle vibration in 1860. Moritz Schiff was first to definitively formulate the specificity theory of pain when, in 1858, he demonstrated that touch and pain sensations traveled to the brain along separate spinal cord pathways. In 1882 Magnus Blix reported that specific spots on the skin elicit sensations of either cold or heat when stimulated, and proposed that \\"the different sensations of cool and warm are caused by stimulation of different, specific receptors in the skin.\\" Max von Frey found and described these heat and cold receptors and, in 1896, reported finding \\"pain spots\\" on the skin of human subjects. Von Frey proposed there are low threshold cutaneous spots that elicit the feeling of touch, and high threshold spots that elicit pain, and that pain is a distinct cutaneous sensation, independent of touch, heat and cold, and associated with free nerve endings.  Intensive theory  In the first volume of his 1794 Zoonomia; or the Laws of Organic Life,Darwin E. Section XIV, 8 Zoonomia; or the Laws of Organic Life 1796 edition. Project Gutenberg text. Erasmus Darwin supported the idea advanced in Plato's Timaeus, that pain is not a unique sensory modality, but an emotional state produced by stronger than normal stimuli such as intense light, pressure or temperature. Wilhelm Erb, in 1874, also argued that pain can be generated by any sensory stimulus, provided it is intense enough, and his formulation of the hypothesis became known as the intensive theory. Alfred Goldscheider (1884) confirmed the existence of distinct heat and cold sensors, by evoking heat and cold sensations using a fine needle to penetrate to and electrically stimulate different nerve trunks, bypassing their receptors. Though he failed to find specific pain sensitive spots on the skin, Goldscheider concluded in 1895 that the available evidence supported pain specificity, and held the view until a series of experiments were conducted in 1889 by Bernhard Naunyn. Naunyn had rapidly (60‚Äì600 times/second) prodded the skin of tabes dorsalis patients, below their touch threshold (e.g., with a hair), and in 6‚Äì20 seconds produced unbearable pain. He obtained similar results using other stimuli including electricity to produce rapid, sub-threshold stimulation, and concluded pain is the product of summation. In 1894 Goldscheider extended the intensive theory, proposing that each tactile nerve fiber can evoke three distinct qualities of sensation ‚Äì tickle, touch and pain ‚Äì the quality depending on the intensity of stimulation; and extended Naunyn's summation idea, proposing that, over time, activity from peripheral fibers may accumulate in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and \\"spill over\\" from the peripheral fiber to a pain-signalling spinal cord fiber once a threshold of activity has been crossed. The British psychologist, Edward Titchener, pronounced in his 1896 textbook, \\"excessive stimulation of any sense organ or direct injury to any sensory nerve occasions the common sensation of pain.\\"  Competing theories  By the mid-1890s, specificity was mainly backed by physiologists (prominently by von Frey) and clinicians; and the intensive theory received most support from psychologists. But after Henry Head in England published a series of clinical observations between 1893 and 1896, and von Frey's experiments between 1894 and 1897, the psychologists migrated to specificity almost en masse, and by century's end, most textbooks on physiology and psychology were presenting pain specificity as fact, with Titchener in 1898 now placing \\"the sensation of pain\\" alongside that of pressure, heat and cold. Though the intensive theory no longer featured prominently in textbooks, Goldscheider's elaboration of it nevertheless stood its ground in opposition to von Frey's specificity at the frontiers of research, and was supported by some influential theorists well into the mid- twentieth century. William Kenneth Livingston advanced a summation theory in 1943, proposing that high intensity signals, arriving at the spinal cord from damage to nerve or tissue, set up a reverberating, self-exciting loop of activity in a pool of interneurons, and once a threshold of activity is crossed, these interneurons then activate \\"transmission\\" cells which carry the signal to the brain's pain mechanism; that the reverberating interneuron activity also spreads to other spinal cord cells that trigger a sympathetic nervous system and somatic motor system response; and these responses, as well as fear and other emotions elicited by pain, feed into and perpetuate the reverberating interneuron activity. A similar proposal was made by RW Gerard in 1951, who proposed also that intense peripheral nerve signalling may cause temporary failure of inhibition in spinal cord neurons, allowing them to fire as synchronized pools, with signal volleys strong enough to activate the pain mechanism.  Pattern theory  Building on John Paul Nafe's 1934 suggestion that different cutaneous qualities are the product of different temporal and spatial patterns of stimulation, and ignoring a large body of strong evidence for receptor fiber specificity, DC Sinclair and G Weddell's 1955 \\"peripheral pattern theory\\" proposed that all skin fiber endings (with the exception of those innervating hair cells) are identical, and that pain is produced by intense stimulation of these fibers. In 1953, Willem Noordenbos had observed that a signal carried from the area of injury along large diameter \\"touch, pressure or vibration\\" fibers may inhibit the signal carried by the thinner \\"pain\\" fibers ‚Äî the ratio of large fiber signal to thin fiber signal determining pain intensity; hence, we rub a smack. This was taken as a demonstration that pattern of stimulation (of large and thin fibers in this instance) modulates pain intensity.  Gate control theory  Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall introduced their \\"gate control\\" theory of pain in the 1965 Science article \\"Pain Mechanisms: A New Theory\\". The authors proposed that both thin (pain) and large diameter (touch, pressure, vibration) nerve fibers carry information from the site of injury to two destinations in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord: transmission cells that carry the pain signal up to the brain, and inhibitory interneurons that impede transmission cell activity. Activity in both thin and large diameter fibers excites transmission cells. Thin fiber activity impedes the inhibitory cells (tending to allow the transmission cell to fire) and large diameter fiber activity excites the inhibitory cells (tending to inhibit transmission cell activity). So, the more large fiber (touch, pressure, vibration) activity relative to thin fiber activity at the inhibitory cell, the less pain is felt. The authors had drawn a neural \\"circuit diagram\\" to explain why we rub a smack. They pictured not only a signal traveling from the site of injury to the inhibitory and transmission cells and up the spinal cord to the brain, but also a signal traveling from the site of injury directly up the cord to the brain (bypassing the inhibitory and transmission cells) where, depending on the state of the brain, it may trigger a signal back down the spinal cord to modulate inhibitory cell activity (and so pain intensity). The theory offered a physiological explanation for the previously observed effect of psychology on pain perception.  Modern theories   A biopsychosocial phenomenon  In 1975, well after the time of Descartes, the International Association for the Study of Pain sought a consensus definition for pain, finalizing \\"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage\\" as the final definition.\\"IASP Taxonomy.\\" International Association for the Study of Pain  Welcome to IASP. International Association for the Study of Pain, 14 July 2011. Web. 06 Nov. 2011. . It is clear from this definition that while it is understood that pain is a physical phenomenon, the emotional state of a person, as well as the context or situation associated with the pain also impacts the perception of the nociceptive or noxious event. Sun Dance of the Shoshone Indians Modern research has gathered considerable amounts of evidence that support the theory that pain is not only a physical phenomenon but rather a biopsychosocial phenomenon, encompassing culture, nociceptive stimuli, and the environment in the experience and perception of pain. For example, the Sun Dance is a ritual performed by traditional groups of Native Americans. In this ritual, cuts are made into the chest of a young man. Strips of leather are slipped through the cuts, and poles are tied to the leather. This ritual lasts for hours and undoubtedly generates large amounts of nociceptive signaling, however the pain may not be perceived as noxious or even perceived at all. The ritual is designed around overcoming and transcending the effects of pain, where pain is either welcomed or simply not perceived.  Visual input and pain perception  Additional research has shown that the experience of pain is shaped by a plethora of contextual factors, including vision. Researchers have found that when a subject views the area of their body that is being stimulated, the subject will report a lowered amount of perceived pain.Mancini, Flavia. \\"Visual Distortion of Body Size Modulates Pain Perception.\\" Psychological Science. (2010): n. page. Web. 9 Dec. 2011. . For example, one research study used a heat stimulation on their subjects' hands. When the subject was directed to look at their hand when the painful heat stimulus was applied, the subject experienced an analgesic effect and reported a higher temperature pain threshold. Additionally, when the view of their hand was increased, the analgesic effect also increased and vice versa. This research demonstrated how the perception of pain relies on visual input. The use of fMRI to study brain activity confirms the link between visual perception and pain perception. It has been found that the brain regions that convey the perception of pain are the same regions that encode the size of visual inputs.Baliki, M. N. . \\"Parsing Pain Perception Between Nociceptive Representation and Magnitude Estimation.\\" Journal of Neurophysiology. 101.2 (2008): 875-87. Print. One specific area, the magnitude-related insula of the insular cortex, functions to perceive the size of a visual stimulation and integrate the concept of that size across various sensory systems, including the perception of pain. This area also overlaps with the nociceptive-specific insula, part of the insula that selectively processes nociception, leading to the conclusion that there is an interaction and interface between the two areas. This interaction tells the individual how much relative pain they are experiencing, leading to the subjective perception of pain based on the current visual stimulus. Humans have always sought to understand why they experience pain and how that pain comes about. While pain was previously thought to be the work of evil spirits, it is now understood to be a neurological signal. However, the perception of pain is not absolute and can be impacted by various factors in including the context surrounding the painful stimulus, the visual perception of the stimulus, and an individual's personal history with pain.

All the tourist attraction in Kalahandi region comes under Bhawanipatna jurisdiction. Though tourist potential of Kalahandi has not been exploited optimally due to poor marketing, political negligence and infrastructure development, the land is very rich in terms of water fall, forest and wild life, natural and scenic beauty, tribal life, mountains, agriculture field, historical sites and handicrafts. The best time to visit Kalahandi region is from October to March. April‚ÄìJune is hard Summer and the mercury may rise to 45 degree C and June to August is the Monsoon Season. It occasionally rains in September, but do not miss the great festival like Nuakhai in September and Dassara in end of September or early October. Beginning of Dessara marks the pleasant weather condition till the celebration of Chaitra in February/March. Introduction  History  The history of Kalahandi goes back to the primitive period where a well-civilized, urbanized and cultured people inhabited on this land mass around 2000 years ago. The world's largest celt of Stone Age and the largest cemetery of the megalithic age have been discovered in Kalahandi ‚Äì this shows the region had cradle of civilization since the pre-historic era. Asurgarh near Narla in Kalahandi was one of the oldest metropolises in Odisha whereas the other one was Sisupalgarh near Bhubaneswar. Some other historical forts in the region includes Budhigarh (ancient period), Amthagarh (ancient period), Belkhandi (ancient to medieval period) and Dadpur-Jajjaldeypur (medieval period). In ancient history this kingdom was serving as salt route to link between ancient Kalinga and South Kosala. This land was unconquered by the great Ashoka, who fought the great Kalinga War, as per Ashokan record.B. Mishra, op.cit., 2003-2004 In medieval period the region had played a prominent role to link South India, Eastern India and Central India region and witnessed the battle ground for Somavamsi, Chola, Kalachuris of Kalyani and Eastern Ganga dynasty. Kalahandi region was the main route for Chola to attack Subarnapur of South Kosal. The history of Kalahandi is rich in terms of contribution towards the Indian culture and temple architecture. Temple of Goddess Stambeswari at Asurgarh, built during 500 AD, is a perfect example where the first brick Temple in Eastern India was built. Sanskritization in Odisha was first started from Kalahandi, Koraput region, ancient Mahakantara region. Earliest flat- roofed stone temple of Odisha was built at Mohangiri in Kalahandi during 600 AD. Temple architecture achieved perfection at Belkhandi in Kalahandi and then traversed to Ekamra, present Bhubaneswar, along with the political expansion of the Somavamsis during the 1000‚Äì1100 AD. The distribution and occurrence of precious and semi-precious gemstones and other commercial commodities of Kalahandi region have found place in accounts of Panini (5th century BC), Kautilya (3rd century BC), Ptolemy (2nd century AD), Wuang Chuang (7th century AD) and Travenier (19th century). Present name Kalahandi finds mention for the first time in the Junagarh Dadhivaman temple inscription issued from Kalahandinagara by Maharaja Jugasai Dev in A. D. 1718...Ramesh Prasad Mohapatra, Archaeology in Odisha, Vol-II, p.233, 1986, Delhi The region was known as various names in different period of time such as Kantara, Mahakantara, Titilaka Janapada, Atavi Land, Chakrakota Mandala, Kamala Mandala and Karonda Mandal. It was also part of South Kosal and Trikalinga. It was a feudatory under Eastern Ganga dynasty, Gadajat under Maratha and Princely State under British rule in India. After independence of India, in 1948, Kalahandi joined Indian Union and became a part of Odisha state. However, in post independence period the name Kalahandi got associated with backwardness despite its rich history, culture, art, craft and agriculture & forest resources.  Topography and culture  The topography of Kalahandi consists of plain land, hills & mountains. Kalahandi is surrounded by hills with its border with other districts in the South and East, whereas large part of its land in North and West is primarily agricultural and plain land. Over one third of tKalahandi is covered with dense jungle forest and one third of the population is tribal. Thus, Kalahandi is a rich land in terms of culture and festivals.Kalahandi: Loka Anusthan, Edited by Jayanta Kumar Behera, Dr Dolagobinda Bisi, Parameswar Mund, Mahabir Sanskrutika Anusthan, 1998 Since it is a melting point of South Odisha and Western Odisha with a substantial tribal population, those living in hills as well as plain land, their different culture, tradition, languages and belief along with mainstream Hindu culture have made Kalahandi region rich with culture and festivals. In pre- independence period Kalahandi was largely inspired to Saivaism, Vaishanivism and Shakti puja. Shakti Puja is largely accepted among tribal, perhaps due to which Kalahandi was well known for celebrating Shati Puja. However, affect induction of Kalahandi as part of Odisha state, dominance of coastal Odisha culture in the state is increasingly influencing the local culture. Celebration of Rathajatra and construction of Jaggannath temple in Kalahandi has been increasingly realized unlike in old days of Radha Krishna temple.  Transportation and hospitality  For transportation to Kalahandi, the nearest airport is located in Raipur (200‚Äì250 km) having daily flights to majority of the cities in India. Kalahandi can be reached from Raipur via Nuapada or Dharamgarh. Vishakhapatnam airport is located in 300 km and Bhubaneswar airport in 450 km. Kesinga is the gateway of Kalahandi for rail connectivity. It is directly linked with most of the major cities in India, such as Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ranchi, Bhubaneswar, Visakhapatnam, Raipur, Nagpur, Ahemadabad etc. by rail. The train connection to Bhawanipatna and Junagarh is getting operational via Lanjigarh road. National Highway 26 and 27 pass through Kalahandi. Luxury night buses are available to Bhubaneswar, Katak, Raipur, Visakhapatnam, Sambalpur and Rourkela from Bhawanipatna, Dharamgarh, Jaipatna, Junagarh, Kesinga, Koksara, etc. Accommodation and hotels are available in Bhawanipatna, Dharamgarh, Junagarh and Kesinga.

A public meeting in 1992 drew support from the local population and, one year later, Verulam Community Radio Limited (VCRL) was incorporated.Companies House Web Site In 1993, as a result of lobbying by VCRL, the Radio Authority decided to advertise a commercial radio licence for St Albans, adding Watford to the area served by the proposed license. The license was awarded to the largest commercial radio operator in the area at the time, Chiltern Radio.  Telecential  After being declined for the commercial radio licence, VCRL were offered the opportunity to launch Radio Verulam as a cable radio station alongside the existing Community Television service 'West Herts TV' on the local cable system based in Hemel Hempstead. A team of presenters began broadcasting as Radio Verulam on the Telecential cable system on Saturday 24 February 1996, initially for just three hours a day. Changes at the Telecential cable company meant that the station had to relocate around Easter 1997. The station moved to premises in Apsley in November 1997 where the station remained for the next eight years.  Apsley  By 2000, Radio Verulam was broadcasting 24 hours a day from Apsley on cable and now also online via the station website with a team of twenty presenters. Radio Verulam was awarded a three-week Restricted Service Licence in 2004, allowing the station to broadcast live throughout that year's St Albans Carnival. OFCOM subsequently announced the opportunity for the first time for applications to be made for Community Radio broadcasting licences. On 16 March 2006, Radio Verulam was granted a full broadcasting licence. Radio Verulam ran another Restricted Service Licence from the town hall during the St Albans Festival in the Summer of 2006. Following negotiations, the station began transmissions from the new premises in Victoria Street on 7 July 2007.  Broadcasting  Radio Verulam now broadcasts 24 hours a day from its studios in central St Albans on 92.6 MHz FM and via an online stream, although FM reception is subject to interference from local pirate radio stations in some areas.

These are garments and accessories that rarely find their way into museum collections, making this an unusual and interesting resource for the study of everyday clothing. Background In 1920 Edith Hodson established a small shop in the front room of her family home at 54 New Road, Willenhall. Catering for a local clientele, the shop sold women's and children's clothing, haberdashery and household goods. Edith was joined at the shop by her sister, Flora, in 1927, but business declined in the late 1950s. Edith died in 1966 and Flora, finding it difficult to manage alone, shut up shop in 1971. Rather than getting rid of the stock, she simply closed the door. After her death in 1983 the collection was discovered and transferred into the ownership of Walsall Museum. In 2003, the Black Country Living Museum took over the running of the premises, turning 54 New Road into a museum known as the Locksmith's House. The Collection The collection contains around 3,000 items dating from the 1920s to the 1960s; including outerwear garments and underwear for women and children, plus accessories, dress patterns, magazines, haberdashery, cosmetics and domestic items. There is a small collection of clothing and accessories for men. The clothing is almost entirely machine-sewn, generally inexpensively made, and was purchased from a range of ready-to-wear manufacturers particularly in Birmingham and Leicester. Fabrics The introduction of man-made fabrics facilitated the development of cheap mass-produced clothing from the 1920s onwards, making fashion and a choice of clothing affordable to many women for the first time. There are a large number of artificial silk and rayon garments that date from the 1920s in the Hodson Shop Collection, with nylon, Orlon, Courtelle, Tricel and terylene being used from the 1950s. Archive The archival material relating to the running of the shop includes order books, invoices, a credit or 'club' book, trade catalogues and advertising material. Many of the garments still have their original price tags attached, giving an insight into the purchasing power of consumers at the lower end of the market and the compromises made by working-class people between quality and affordability. The Utility Scheme The Utility Scheme was introduced in the United Kingdom during World War II as a response to the growing shortage of materials in the country. Designers were challenged to create styles using the minimum amounts of fabric, and trimmings were restricted. The general clothing collection of Walsall Museum Service includes a large selection of Utility garments, with 278 items in the Hodson Shop Collection alone.

An externology permits to introduce a notion of end point, to study the divergence of nets in terms of convergence to end points and it is a useful tool for the study and classification of some families of non compact topological spaces. It can also be used to approach a topological space as the limit of other topological spaces: the externologies are very useful when a compact metric space embedded in a Hilbert space is approached by its open neighbourhoods.  Definition  Let (X,œÑ) be a topological space. An externology on (X,œÑ) is a non-empty collection Œµ of open subsets satisfying: * If E1, E2 ‚àà Œµ, then E1 ‚à© E2 ‚àà Œµ; * if E ‚àà Œµ, U ‚àà œÑ and E ‚äÜ U, then U ‚àà Œµ. An exterior space (X,œÑ,Œµ) consists of a topological space (X,œÑ) together with an externology Œµ. An open E which is in Œµ is said to be an exterior-open subset. A map f:(X,œÑ,Œµ) ‚Üí (X',œÑ',Œµ') is said to be an exterior map if it is continuous and f‚àí1(E) ‚àà Œµ, for all E ‚àà Œµ'. The category of exterior spaces and exterior maps will be denoted by E. It is remarkable that E is a complete and cocomplete category.  Some examples of exterior spaces  * For a space (X,œÑ) one can always consider the trivial externology Œµtr={X}, and, on the other hand, the total externology Œµtot=œÑ. Note that an externology Œµ is a topology if and only if the empty set is a member of Œµ if and only if Œµ=œÑ. * Given a space (X,œÑ), the externology ŒµXcc of the complements of closed compact subsets of X permits a connection with the theory of proper maps. * Given a space (X,œÑ) and a subset A‚äÜX the family Œµ(X,A)={U‚äÜX:A‚äÜU,U‚ààœÑ} is an externology in X. Two particular cases with important applications on shape theory and on dynamical systems, respectively, are the following: * If A is a closed subspace of the Hilbert cube X=Q the externology ŒµA=Œµ(Q,A) is a resolution of A in the sense of the shape theory. * Let X be a continuous dynamical system and P the subset of periodic points; we can consider the externology Œµ(X,P). More generally, if A is an invariant subset the externology Œµ(X,A) is useful to study the dynamical properties of the flow.  Applications of exterior spaces  * Proper homotopy theory: A continuous map f:X‚ÜíY between topological spaces is said to be proper if for every closed compact subset K of Y, f‚àí1(K) is a compact subset of X. The category of spaces and proper maps will be denoted by P. This category and the corresponding proper homotopy category are very useful for the study of non compact spaces. Nevertheless, one has the problem that this category does not have enough limits and colimits and then we can not develop the usual homotopy constructions like loops, homotopy limits and colimits, etc. An answer to this problem is the category of exterior spaces E which admits Quillen model structures and contains as a full subcategory the category of spaces and proper maps; that is, there is full and faithful functor P‚ÜíE which carries a topological space (X,œÑ) to the exterior space (X,œÑ,ŒµXcc). * Proper LS category: The problem of finding Ganea and Whitehead characterizations of this proper invariant can not be faced within the proper category because of the lack of (co)limits. Nevertheless, an extension of this invariant to the category of exterior spaces permits to find a solution to such a problem. This numerical proper invariant has been applied to the study of open 3-manifolds. * Shape theory: Many shape invariants (Borsuk groups, Quigley inward and approaching groups) of a compact metric space can be obtained as exterior homotopy groups of the exterior space determined by the open neighborhoods of a compact metric space embedded in the Hilbert cube. * Discrete and continuous dynamical systems (semi-flows and flows): There are many constructions that associate an exterior space to a dynamical system, for example: Given a continuous (discrete) flow one can consider the exterior spaces induced by the open neighborhoods of the subset of periodic points, Poisson periodic points, omega limits, etc. The constructions and properties of these associated exterior spaces are used to study the dynamical properties of the (semi-flow) flow.

It is located at Wilton Place, just off Chapel Street, Salford, Greater Manchester, England. The church was relaunched in 2016 as Saint Philips Chapel Street, described as an old church on a new journey: a church plant in partnership with New Wine. The building is recorded in the National Heritage List for England and is designated Grade II*. It was a Commissioners' church, having received a grant towards its construction from the Church Building Commission. In planning the church its architect Sir Robert Smirke re-used his design for St Mary's Church, Bryanston Square, London. The tower design was also used for St Anne's Church, Wandsworth. History The church was built between 1822 and 1824 to a design by Sir Robert Smirke. A grant of ¬£16,804 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) was given towards its construction by the Church Building Commission. The interior of the church was re-ordered in 1895 by J. Medland Taylor. In 1962 the nearby church of St Stephen closed, and the parishes merged to form the parish of St Philip with St Stephen. Architecture Exterior St Philip's is constructed in ashlar stone. Its architectural style is Greek Revival. It has an undivided plan, with a semicircular portico to the south surmounted by a bell tower. The body of the church is expressed as two storeys. The windows in the upper storey are round-headed, and those in the lower storey are straight- headed. There are nine bays along the north and south sides, and three bays along the east and west sides. The central three bays on the south side are occupied by the portico that encloses a semicircular porch. The portico is carried on an Ionic colonnade with a balustraded parapet. The bell tower has plain pilasters between which are round-arched openings that are alternately open and blind. Above this stage are four clock faces, and the summit is capped by a dome. The clock was made by Whitehurst and Company of Derby. On the west front are three doorways; the central bay projects slightly forward, and has a pediment above the doorway. Interior Inside the church are galleries on three sides. The stained glass in the east window dates from the mid to late 19th century and was designed by R .B. Edmundson of Manchester. In the southeast chapel is a memorial to the First World War by Humphries, Jackson and Ambler, also of Manchester. The two-manual organ was made by Renn and Boston in 1829. It was moved forward from a position above the west door to the west gallery in 1873 by Alex Young and Company. who also carried out modifications. The organ was cleaned and restored in 1915 by Wadsworth and Company. In 1963 Noel Mander, who respected the historical importance of the instrument, carried out a further restoration which reversed some of 1873 modifications. Present day Services and other activities Saint Philips gathers to worship at 9:30am (Common Worship Communion service), 10:45am (contemporary service, including groups for children), and 6:30pm (contemporary service, including groups for young people) each Sunday. In addition to church services on Sundays, the church is used for concerts, recitals and community activities. It is open to visitors between 10 am and 4 pm on Wednesdays. It runs many community activities, groups, and initiatives throughout the week, including Alpha for those exploring the Christian faith, Chapel Tots, KidsLife for primary school aged children, Bags of Hope, student groups, and much more. Saint Philips works closely with St Philip's Church of England Primary School, located on Barrow Street.

The premises, on New Road, consist of a house and backyard workshops, typical of the many family run lock making businesses which once thrived in the town. The house itself was built in 1840, but the period interiors date to 1904, when the Hodson lock making family first lived there. Lock making skills are demonstrated by volunteers using original tools and equipment, such as the floor press and belt driven machinery. The Lock Museum was opened to the public in 1987. Since 2003, it has been owned and managed by the Black Country Living Museum. The buildings The house and its adjoining workshops and outbuildings were awarded Grade II listed status by English Heritage in 1984 and 1986. The listed structures include the two storey workshop on the East side of the yard plus the single storey workshop (originally a stamping shop) on the West side of the yard, directly adjoining the back of the house. Richard Hodson & Sons The business of Richard Hodson & Sons was established in 1792, according to the firm's letterhead. In 1893, it was taken on by John Hodson, who later passed it to his son Edgar. The Hodsons specialised in bar padlocks and also in lighter locks - these locks would have been used to secure cargo on a lighter. Lock parts were manufactured and assembled in the two storey workshop behind the house. Completed orders would have been brought into the yard and loaded into carts. From here they could have been sent all over the world, by rail or via the extensive Midlands canal network and on to coastal ports. Hodson locks were certainly exported to South America and beyond. The Drapers' Shop From the 1920s, the front room of the Locksmith's House was run as a drapers' shop by two of Edgar Hodson's sisters, Edith and Flora. The Hodson Shop operated until 1971, and the unsold stock forms a rich resource on working class costume, now in the care of Walsall Museum.

Description Eudicella euthalia reaches about of length in the males, while the females are slightly smaller, reaching about of length. Head and pronotum are usually metallic green whilst the elytra are a pale to strong yellow with four dark black spots on each corner. The six legs are dark red in coloration. The male possesses a \\"Y\\"-shaped horn pointing upwards from the forehead, used in fighting other males for females and in defense of territory. This varies in size due to conditions and quality of habitat in the larval stage and hereditary genetics. The horn, like the legs. Is a ruddy red in coloration. Females lay eggs into a substrate of rotting leaf litter and wood, eggs that require about ten days to hatch in optimum habitat conditions. The development of larvae takes about five months, feeding on the substrate they are laid in. The larvae pupate in pupal cells constructed of this substrate and solidified saliva, the pupal stage lasts for about two months whilst metamorphosed adults will undergo a teneral phase within the pupal cell for a period of 2‚Äì3 days prior to emergence. Adult beetles feed on the nectar and pollen of flowers as well as overripe fruits. Distribution This species can be found in tropical East Africa, mainly in Tanzania, Rwanda, Malawi and Zimbabwe.

Over the years, with research done at the Department of Informatics of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, it evolved into a semiotic theory of human-computer interaction (HCI).de Souza, C.S. (2005) The Semiotic Engineering of Human-Computer Interaction. The MIT Press. Semiotic Engineering views HCI as computer-mediated communication between designers and users at interaction time. The system speaks for its designers in various types of conversations specified at design time. These conversations communicate the designers' understanding of who the users are, what they know the users want or need to do, in which preferred ways, and why. The designers' message to users includes even the interactive language in which users will have to communicate back with the system in order to achieve their specific goals. So, the process is in fact one of communication about communication, or metacommunication. Semiotic engineering has two methods to evaluate the quality of metacommunication in HCI: the semiotic inspection method (SIM) and the communicability evaluation method (CEM). In the 2009 book Semiotic Engineering Methods for Scientific Research in HCI, Clarisse de Souza and Carla Leit√£o discuss how SIM and CEM, which are both qualitative methods, can also be used in scientific contexts to generate new knowledge about HCI.de Souza, C.S.; Leit√£o, C.F. (2009) Semiotic Engineering Methods for Scientific Research in HCI. Morgan Claypool. To illustrate their points, the authors present an extensive case study with a free open-source digital audio editor called Audacity. They show how the results obtained with a triangulation of SIM and CEM point at new research avenues not only for semiotic engineering and HCI but also for other areas of computer science such as software engineering and programming. Ren√© Jorna and Clarisse de Souza independently developed two different kinds of ‚Äòsemiotic engineering.‚Äô Jorna's was originally closer to Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science. His ideas were later developed and applied to decision support systems and organizational semiotics rather than HCI. The authors were introduced to each other (and to each other's version of 'semiotic engineering') only in 1996, in a Dagstuhl Seminar on Informatics and Semiotics organized by Peter B.

The force entered the Taliban-controlled Chora District and Balochistan region, both of which are located north-east of the provincial capital, Tarin Kowt. The offensive's goal was to protect Tarin Kowt, the site of a soon-to-be base, from a potential Taliban attack. Battle Surk Murgab The first action of the offensive occurred in late April, when Lieutenant Marco Kroon led a platoon consisting of twenty-nine Dutch Commando Corps (KCT) soldiers from \\"Task Force Viper\\", alongside twenty-nine Australian Special Air Service Regiment (SAS) soldiers, into the village of Surk Murgab ( from Tarin Kowt). With the objective to ascertain the presence of an enemy force, the coalition troops entered the village. Upon their arrival they encountered intense fire. Threatened with being pinned down by the weight of the fire and unable to move, the contingent was forced to call in air support to enable them to break contact and withdraw. A second attempt to secure the village was initiated four days later and, again, heavy fire forced the coalition force to withdraw. An Australian vehicle was unable to leave (the exact cause is unclear) and was a target for the Taliban. Using an armed diversion, the Dutch managed to distract the insurgents long enough to allow the Australians to repair their vehicle and pull back. Chora Valley The Dutch-Australian offensive moved north into the Chora Valley a month later. While moving through an open area devoid of cover, the joint force came under attack by the Taliban, who fired at them with mortars, RPGs and 107-millimetre rockets. At a tactical disadvantage, Kroon decided to call a halt to the advance, but the Australians, having suffered a casualty, were unable to break contact immediately and the Dutch troops were forced to move forward again to help them. Acting once again as a decoy force, the Dutch drew the attention of the Taliban while the Australians evacuated their wounded soldier. In response, the Taliban focused their fire more intensely upon the Dutch. The fire was of such weight that the Australians later claimed that at the time \\"they had not thought Kroon's platoon would make it\\". The Dutch force were nevertheless able to make good their withdrawal and two weeks later the coalition troops re-entered the Chora Valley. As per their previous attempt, the Taliban reacted strongly and the Australian SAS members were soon placed under intense fire. Kroon sought to aid the Australian contingent, but the vehicle he was traveling in rolled over due to the rough terrain; the crew inside the upturned vehicle only narrowly escaped the mortars and shells that subsequently exploded in close proximity as the Taliban targeted their stricken vehicle. As the Australians and Dutch attempted to interrupt a Taliban supply route, they were attacked again at short range in country that provided good cover for ambushes. Attempting to extricate his men from the trap, Kroon led them in a dangerous passage of lines manoeuvre that took them through the Australian positions, where the SAS troopers were returning fire. Moving back to higher ground, one of the Dutch vehicles was hit by an RPG, but it was able to continue on. The coalition force then established itself in a defensive position in preparation for further attacks; these came throughout the course of eight hours as, amidst 50 degree Celsius heat, they fought off the Taliban. By the end of the fighting a total of 13 Taliban soldiers had been killed. Operation Perth and Operation Chitag In mid-July, the Australians launched Operation Perth in an effort to remove the Taliban presence from the Chora Valley. As a part of this offensive, the Dutch were again involved, launching their own operation known as Operation Chitag. The operations occurred as part of a multi-national coalition operation to clear the Chora Valley, north-east of Tarin Kowt, involving more than 500 troops from six nations. Units involved included elements of the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment and the Special Air Service Regiment and the Netherlands Korps Commandotroepen. Heavy fighting with Taliban insurgents resulted, and during the intense combat the Australians fought their way through the valley, clearing it in a series of synchronised and closely coordinated operations. Despite meeting stiff resistance from several hundred insurgents, the operation was ultimately successful with the Taliban sustaining heavy casualties and eventually fleeing the valley. On the night of 12/13 July, a combined Dutch and Australian force, became surrounded by a larger Taliban force during an engagement north-east of Tarin Kowt. Running low on ammunition, their situation became desperate and air support from a US Air Force AC-130 gunship was called in.Coulthard-Clark 2001, p. 298. Armed with a \\"105-millimetre howitzer, 40-millimetre cannon and Gatling guns\\", the aircraft could deliver intense indirect fire support that could regain the initiative for the coalition troops and push the Taliban back from their position. By the time the gunship arrived over battle, the Taliban had advanced to within of the coalition position. Despite the risk of collateral damage, Kroon proceeded to call down the gunship's fire. The incident was later described in an official Dutch report. \\"The air around the two platoons was thick with shrapnel but the 40-millimetre and 105-millimetre shells launched by the aircraft had a devastating effect on the Taliban\\". Following the fighting, the Dutch and Australian units were able to continue their advance over the next four days, before the operation was successfully concluded. One Dutch soldier was killed during the offensive and at least 13 coalition soldiers were wounded, including six Australians. Aftermath The joint offensive in the Chora and Baluchi areas was deemed a great success by the Dutch. Despite initial set backs, the \\"pass entering the valley was opened\\" and the coalition forces were eventually able to gain freedom of movement throughout the area. Casualties on the coalition side were light, with only one coalition soldier being killed and another being wounded; Taliban casualties were estimated by an official Dutch report as being \\"up to 300 killed\\". For his actions during the offensive, Kroon was later awarded the Military Order of William, the Netherlands' highest military decoration.

Biography Kwee Tek Hoay, the youngest son of Tjiam Kwee Hong and Tan Ay Nio, often played truant during his early school years because he could not understand the language of instruction, Hokkien. He started learning the textile business from his father, and during this period began taking interest in reading books. Kwee began his writing career as a journalist. He served on the editorial board for magazines and newspapers, such as Ho Po Li Po (Bogor), and Sin Po (Batavia, Jakarta). In 1926, Kwee ventured into publishing his own magazine, called Panorama, but could not sustain it; he eventually sold it to the jurist, politician and newspaper proprietor Phoa Liong Gie in 1931. His most famous paper on the history and background of the founding association Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan, \\"The Origins of the Modern Chinese Movement in Indonesia\\", came out in series from August 1936 to January 1939. As a journalist Kwee attained much success, but he achieved yet another mark as a novelist and playwright. His first story in drama form that received acclaim was Allah jang Palsoe (Counterfeit God). Published in 1919 the story condemns those people who are driven by money. Another of his works, Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Tjikembang), was inspired by William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Kwee adapted the story to reflect Indonesian circumstances, but also used the book to open discussion on the issue of the nyai, a concubine often kept by young unmarried men. The novel has been adapted for a play and twice for a screenplay, in 1931 and 1975. A recent staging of the play drew many people to see it for the sake of nostalgia. His drama The Victim Yi Yong Toan was staged in 1928. It was a criticism of the removal of young men to China to fight the Japanese army. Most of his works were inspired by real-life incidents and political issues. The drama Digoel was based on the life of a Communist Party leader and his daughter. Another of his works, titled Drama in Boven Digul, was based on the events of the PKI rebellion against the Dutch government. In 2011, this drama was also selected as Kwee's magnum opus by the Gerakan Indonesia Membaca Sastra (GIMS) or the Indonesia Reads Literature Movement as their first work of Indonesian literature to be read. Another of Kwee's works, Nonton Cap Go Meh, was honoured by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, in November 2011, along with eight others with the Bintang Budaya Parama Dharma award for contributing to the cultural heritage of the country. Set in the 1930s, the drama is a reflection of Kwee's progressive philosophy. It revolves around the life of a married couple, Thomas and Lies, who wanted to watch 'Cap Go Meh', a celebration of the 15th day after the New Year. However, they were not allowed to go out together, because of the restrictive old-school social rule that allowed them only the company of the members of the same gender. The couple not only expressed their dislike for such restrictive thinking, but also set an example for the youth to adopt more modern thinking. During the 1920s, Kwee became actively engaged in the Tri Dharma. He ensured that the Buddhist temple in Jakarta also served as an institution for lessons on Buddhism. He is credited with the publication of the first Indonesian-language magazine on the teachings of Buddhism, Dharma Moestika (1932‚Äì1934). Recognizing the contributions of Kwee and other major writers to Indonesian literature, Gramedia released a series of ten volumes, titled \\"Kesastraan Melayu Tionghoa dan Kebangsaan Indonesia\\", (Chinese-Malay Literature and Indonesian Nationhood). Many of Kwee's writings that document the life and culture of the 19th and 20th century Indonesia are included in the publication. Kwee's works have been performed by many theatres, such as Theatre Bejana that started with Bunga Roos dari Cikembang in February 2004, an adaptation of Kwee's Pencuri (The Thief) in 2010, Zonder Lentera (Without Light) in 2011 and Nonton Cap Go Meh in 2012.

They are located at the SW corner of Shan State and in Kayah State, a mountainous region where the only relatively flat area is Loikaw, the capital. The southern end runs into Kayin State. One of the first all-weather roads in Burma was across the Karen Hills connecting Taungoo with Loilem. Lawpita Falls, Myanmar's largest hydropower plant, built by the Japanese as war reparation, is located in these mountains.Lawpita Hydropower Project The name of the range is derived from the Karen people who occupy the highland area.

Human activity and ecology The Karen Hills are covered with dense montane rain forest. Local villages used to be far up in the hills and as much off the main roads as possible and villagers used to cultivate upland rice in forest clearings. Owing to the activity of the Tatmadaw in the area many local people have moved across the border into Thailand where they live in refugee camps.Karen Cultural Profile - Geography These mountains are geologically and ecologically homogeneous with the neighboring Dawna Range and the head of the Tenasserim Hills, so that frequently the whole mountainous area is considered as a whole under the name \\"Kayah-Karen/Tenasserim\\".Global 200 ecoregion: Kayah-Karen / Tenasserim Moist Forests They are covered with tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, the Kayah-Karen montane rain forests; these are part of the Kayah-Karen/Tenasserim moist forests ecoregionKayah Karen Tenasserim Ecoregion which is included in the Global 200 list of ecoregions identified by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) as priorities for conservation.

Amrani then committed suicide by shooting himself with a revolver. Earlier that day, he had also murdered a woman in his house. The attack occurred on the same day and at the same hour as the 2011 Florence shootings.  Attack  The attack took place on 13 December 2011, at 12:33 local time (11:33 UTC) in Saint-Lambert Square, home to the town's courthouse. It was a busy day with many shoppers in the nearby Christmas market. Witnesses reported four explosions and gunfire. At first, it was believed that there were two or more assailants, who threw stun grenades into the courthouse while another hurled them at a bus shelter. The gunman then fired shots with a 7.62√ó51mm NATO FN FAL from the rooftop of a bakery shop, located across the square. Police were on the scene quickly and sealed off the square. Amrani killed five people in the attack and wounded 125 others, seven seriously. After that, Amrani committed suicide by shooting himself with a Smith & Wesson M57 .41 Magnum revolver. Two of the dead were teenage boys aged 15 and 17. A 17-month-old boy died later in a hospital. A 75-year-old woman died from her injuries two days after the attack. A fifth victim, who had been in an induced coma since the attack, died of head injuries on 23 December.Zesde slachtoffer van Nordine Amrani overleden, De Standaard (23 December 2011) Victims *Antonietta Racano, 45, died at Amrani's apartment on 13 December *Mehdi Belhadj, 15, died at Saint-Lambert Square on 13 December *Pierre G√©rouville, 17, died at Saint- Lambert Square on 13 December *Gabri√´l Leblond, 1, died at a hospital on 13 December *Claudette Putzeys, 75, died at a hospital on 15 December *Laurent Kremer, 20, died at a hospital on 23 December  Perpetrator  Nordine Amrani Nordine Amrani (15 November 1978 ‚Äì 13 December 2011) was born in Ixelles/Elsene in Brussels, Belgium. He was a French-speaking Belgian of Moroccan origin and a welder by trade. According to Amrani's lawyer, he could not speak Arabic nor was he Muslim. Amrani was known to have an interest in guns, with a history of convictions for possession of weapons. He grew up near Brussels, and was living with his fianc√©e, a home care nurse. Orphaned early, he was raised in foster homes.Belgian Gunman, Long in Trouble With Law, Killed Before Rampage Amrani had been released from prison in October 2010. He had been convicted to a 58-month (4 years, 10 months) sentence he received from a Li√®ge court in 2008. The conviction was for possession of thousands of weapons parts, almost 10,000 rounds of ammunition, dozens of weapons, including a rocket launcher, assault and sniper rifles, as well as 2,800 cannabis plants, in the context of a criminal conspiracy (association de malfaiteurs). He also had convictions for handling stolen goods and sex offences but had no known links to terror groups. On the day of the attack, Amrani had been summoned for an interview with the police to answer questions about a sexual abuse case. Before the attack, Amrani transferred money from his account to that of his girlfriend. On the morning of the attack, Amrani killed a 45-year-old woman in his apartment. The victim was working as a cleaner for Amrani's neighbour. He possibly lured her into his flat under the pretext of offering her work. After the murder, he hid her body in his shed, then left his flat for the city centre, equipped with a backpack containing the weapons.  Reaction  Domestic Recently appointed Prime Minister of Belgium Elio Di Rupo visited the location of the attack later in the day and described the attack as \\"horrible\\". He added, \\"The whole country shares the pain of the families affected. We share the shock of the population.\\" Albert II, King of the Belgians, was shocked and visited Li√®ge on the same day, along with Queen Paola. They were received by the Governor, the Prime Minister and the Lord Mayor of Li√®ge. Prince Philippe, the Duke of Brabant, honoured the victims in a public ceremony later. In the Chamber of Representatives of Belgium a minute of silence was held in honour of the victims. Willy Demeyer, the mayor of Li√®ge, condemned the attack and said the attack had \\"sown sorrow in the heart of the city\\".  International  Condolences were expressed by the governments of Australia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Singapore and the United Kingdom.

It emphasizes importance of the culturally valuable building legacy and the boulevards and other parkland. The most prominent monuments are the industrial buildings on the north bank of the Kokem√§enjoki, the neo-gothic Central church of Pori and neo-renaissance building, the Junnelius palace which is currently used as the City Hall. The National Urban Park also contains the Pori bridge; the Old Courthouse; the unique collection of stone buildings, \\"stone Pori\\"; the Juselius Mausoleum, and Kirjurinluoto island, made famous by the Pori Jazz Festival. Green corridor through the town The Pori National Urban Park forms a single green corridor dissecting the city and you can move along it from the Kokem√§enjoki river delta with its famous birdlife, through the city centre to the Isom√§ki open-air sports complex and then on to the countryside surrounding the town. The urban park counterbalances the built-up sections of the city and saves the natural part of the town, the parks that have been built, and the cultural landscape, to form a unified area of recreation for the citizens of Pori. Small islands are part of the history Pori was founded in 1558 by Duke John, John III of Sweden, at which time the mouth of the Kokem√§enjoki was at the site of the present town centre. As time passed, as a result of the rise of the land and the decomposition of river silt, small islands, or islets, were formed just off the shore. The names of the islets come from the historical recreation areas of the city officials. The special thing about the islets is the idyllic villa community of early twentieth- century workers \\"summer homes\\". An example of an English-style park, Kirjurinluoto has been the recreational area for Pori people for over a century. The historical park oasis was complemented by the beach added in 1996, and the Pelle Hermanni children‚Äôs playground. Kirjurinluoto has been the concert venue for the Pori Jazz festival since 1966. The park complex is being expanded towards the Kirjurinluoto Arena on Raatimiehenluoto. Kirjurinluoto is connected to the city centre by the pontoon bridge Taavi. The Pormestari bridge completed in the summer of 2001 connects Kirjurinluoto to the Pormestarinluoto and Isosanta districts of Pori. Nature a strong presence The Kokem√§enjoki river flows through the middle of the Pori national urban park, and from its northern side the river fans out towards the sea into the widest river delta of the Nordic countries. The unspoiled nature of the riverbank groves reaches right up to the town centre. In the centre of town, nature is present in the crisscross boulevards, which are famous for providing a nesting place for rooks. To the south, the urban park is connected directly with the surrounding countryside. Industrial history of the North bank Industrialisation gave rise to a heritage of buildings along the riverbank, which have been well preserved. The north bank of the Kokem√§enjoki is dominated by the redbrick building of the cotton mill. Large-scale industry has, however, partly given way after the period of industrialisation, to make room for a thriving centre of excellence, containing the university centre of Pori. Pearl of the urban park - the south bank of the river, Etel√§ranta The stone buildings on the south bank of the river Kokem√§enjoki with their administrative buildings and the boulevards that dissect the centre tell of numerous fires in the city and of the set of values of that time. \\"Kivi-Pori\\" (stone Pori), built in the spirit of the neo-renaissance, is a cultural environment of national significance. Avenues a part of the townscape The key features of the urban park ‚Äì the tree-lined avenues, which criss-cross the centre of Pori ‚Äì have featured in the city structure since the last town fire of 1852. Pori's national urban park is an integral part of the inhabitants' everyday life with the opportunities it brings for recreation. The pedestrianised area in the town centre, Promenadi-Pori, which has been developed since the 1970s, is now complemented by the national urban park of Pori. Portal that connects Railway buildings have brought their own theme to the national urban park of Pori. The old wooden railway station of Pori is located at the end of L√§nsipuisto (West Avenue) and the present railway station built in the functional style lies to the south. The Portal, an underpass going under the railway station, was completed in 1998 and connects the southern and northern areas of the urban park. The length of the zone is 11 km and at the point of the central avenues the zone measures almost 3 km in the east-west direction. The width of the urban park varies from a good kilometre at the islands and the forest of Pori to only a hundred metres at the central avenues. The narrowest point of the urban park is as it passes below the railway and highway 2 along the Portal. The total surface area of the park is about 9.5 km¬≤.

THE DIGITAL GAME) is a tabletop electro-mechanical game marketed by Tomy starting in 1977 in the USA. The system can only play one two-player game that is very similar to Atari's video game Pong. In Germany, the system was sold under the name Blip-o-Mat. In Japan, the game was marketed as World Tennis. Gameplay For a two-player game, the game's selector switch was set to position 2 (for two players). The game was then turned on and the red LED ball lit up. Whichever side the ball was on served first. The server's score counter was set to \\"0\\" while the receiver's counter was set to \\"R\\". The timer was then turned. A push of the \\"serve\\" button began the game. The players must anticipate where the ball would land in one of three spaces on the \\"playing field\\" marked 1, 2, and 3. The player must then push the corresponding button before the ball \\"lands\\" on the space. If the player was successful in anticipating the ball's space and pushed the button in time, the ball was then \\"returned\\" to the opposing player. If the player anticipated wrongly, the ball would stop and that player must then serve the ball, giving the opposing player 1 point. Game play continued until either the timer stopped or 10 points was earned by one of the players. Blip was also capable of being played by a single person when the selector switch was set to position 1. Development and history The Blip shown with original box Blip was designed by Hikoo Usami for the Tomy Kogyo Co., the patent being filed in 1976 and awarded on December 19, 1977. The game was housed in a plastic case with a translucent screen. On the screen was a hash line dividing the screen in half (and simulating a net) and contained the three positions for the ball to land for both sides. The upper portion of the case also contained the 1, 2, and 3 position buttons, the serve buttons, the player selector, and the timer dial. The underside contained the wheels to turn the score counters and the battery compartment. It was the timer which provided the motor function to the game. Upon the timer dial being turned, this wound a spring which then, via several gears, drove the arm upon which the LED light (the ball) was mounted. Movement of the LED was ostensibly random but a player was capable of memorizing the movements of the LED and recognize patterns which would enable the player to better anticipate where the \\"ball\\" would land. Power for the LED was provided by two AA batteries. However, because the game was mechanical, in the right light conditions, it was possible to play Blip without batteries as one could see the unlit LED under the screen. Tomy marketed Blip in the U.S. starting in 1977. In Japan, Blip was marketed as World Tennis and differed from the U.S. game by having the words \\"World Tennis\\" emblazoned on the screen and replacing the 1, 2, and 3 on the screen with silhouettes of tennis players. The Blip name remained on the Japanese version. In France, the game was marketed by Meccatronic. The German version was called Blip-o-Matic, although the Blip name remained on the case.

According to its own statute, the main objective of the Academy was to raise the quality level of Poland's publishing, while working in conjunction with the government efforts and NGO endeavors focused on the advancement of Polish culture and art in general. The century of foreign Partitions of Poland, ending in 1918, was marked by the forcible suppression of Polish education, language and religion under Prussian (and later German rule, see Kulturkampf),Maciej Janowski, Frederick's \\"Iroquois of Europe\\" in Polish liberal thought before 1918; Central European University Press, 2004, . and outright Russification in the territories occupied by the Tsarist Empire,Liudmila Gatagova, \\"The Crystallization of Ethnic Identity in the Process of Mass Ethnophobias in the Russian Empire.

It resulted in staggering levels of illiteracy on Polish lands, as noted by Stefan ≈ªeromski in 1923. #Stefan ≈ªeromski, Proposal for the Creation of the Academy of Polish Literature (Projekt Akademii Literatury Polskiej). 1918.

Wikisource. #Rada Ministr√≥w RP, Wawrzyn akademicki (Academic laurel), 1934. Decree of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Poland. Wikisource. PAL was called forth to reinforce the historic standards of quality, exalt the honor of Poland's literary tradition and explore the intricacies of her heritage. It was proposed for the first time by ≈ªeromski in 1920 already, but accepted as an idea only nine years later (and five years after his death), in 1929. Organization and the awards for contributions to literature The structure of the Academy was modeled on the corresponding French Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. It consisted of 15 members chosen for life, seven of whom were selected by the Minister of Religion and Public Education. The remaining eight were proposed by the members of the first group. Notably, socialist writer and Freemason, Andrzej Strug declined the offer, upset by voices of official criticism of the movement. See also: Google translation from Polish. The Academy awarded two highest national honors for contribution to the development of Polish literature: the Gold and the Silver Laurel (Z≈Çoty, and Srebrny Wawrzyn). Another prize, also widely regarded, was the Young Writer's Award, a door-opener for new and emerging talent. The honorary members included also the Academy's main promoters: President of Poland Ignacy Mo≈õcicki and Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. Among the members of the Academy were the luminaries of Poland's literary life including its own president Wac≈Çaw Sieroszewski, vicepresident Leopold Staff, secretary general Juliusz Kaden- Bandrowski, and popular writers such as Wac≈Çaw Berent, Piotr Choynowski, Zofia Na≈Çkowska, Zenon Przesmycki, Karol Irzykowski, Juliusz Kleiner, Boles≈Çaw Le≈õmian, Karol Hubert Rostworowski, Wincenty Rzymowski, Tadeusz Boy-≈ªele≈Ñski, Jerzy Szaniawski, and Tadeusz Zieli≈Ñski. The composition changed after the death Choynowski (1935) and Le≈õmian (1937) and after the withdrawal from PAL by Rzymowski accused of plagiarism (1937), and by Rostworowski (1937) protesting against the change of government. The new members were soon appointed, including writers Ferdynand Goetel, Kornel Makuszy≈Ñski, Jan Lorentowicz, and Kazimierz Wierzy≈Ñski. The Academy ceased to exist following the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. Epilogue In 1947 following World War II, in the Soviet-controlled People's Republic of Poland, there was a discussion among some communist writers about whether to reinstate the Academy. The leading proponent of Polish Stalinism from Ku≈∫nica, Jan Kott, summarized the subject in the following way: \\"The Academy is like the monarchy; if it has existed for some time, one can get used to it, just as one can get accustomed to progressive bulbar palsy. But to start it afresh ‚Äì that leads to trouble.\\" Notes and references Category:Learned societies of Poland Category:Arts organizations established in 1933 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1939 Category:1933 establishments in Poland ","title":"Polish Academy of Literature"},{"id":"34045703","text":"Quote Roller is a software as a service that helps to create, send and track business proposals online with built-in analytics and electronic signatures.

He was best known for walking around the world.  Around the world  In 1908, the Touring club de France announced a contest for walking around the world, with an offered prize of 100,000 francs.PresƒÉ de calitate: aventura celor patru rom√¢ni reconstituitƒÉ de Gazeta Sporturilor \\"(16 August 2011). Gazeta Sporturilor. Dumitru Dan and his countrymen Paul P√¢rvu, George Negreanu and Alexandru Pascu were all students in Paris at the time, and they decided to take up the challenge, using their own money and resources. The group returned to Romania to prepare, learning additional languages, studying cartography, and doing weight training and exercises for two hours a day. They walked 45 km per day, travelling through plains, hills and mountains in all seasons. They learned Romanian folk songs and dances and how to play the flute and accordion so that they could support their endeavor along the way by performing their native folklore. In 1910, the group set out on their voyage with a dog, Harap, wearing native garb and walking in sandals. Much of the route was covered between 1910 and 1916, but Dan's companions did not survive until the trip's completion in 1923.  Death of fellow travelers  On 17 July 1911, in India, the group were invited to the palace of the Rajah of Bombay. After sharing a meal there, the walkers went in group to purchase supplies for their journey in town. Alexandru Pascu remained to tell the Rajah about their adventures to that point. His companions returned to find Pascu and their hosts had indulged in and passed out from opium. Although their hosts felt Pascu would likely recover, he never woke. He died as a result of opium poisoning and was buried in India. George Negreanu died two years into the voyage, when the then trio were crossing a narrow mountain pass in the Nanling Mountains in China. In a brief rain during which they were forced to feel their way with canes, Negreanu - at the head of the group - fell onto rocks from a sharp precipice. Dan and P√¢rvu carried him to a local settlement and then to a hospital but there was no doctor available there to assist. By the time medical care was found, Negreanu was dead. P√¢rvu found himself unable to continue in Jacksonville, Florida. Several years earlier, he had wounded his legs during the more than 2600 km walk across Alaska (coming from China and Siberian Russia) on the route Kotzebue, Fairbanks, Anchorage, Yakutat, Gustavus, Skagway and Juneau, and he developed gangrene. Advised by doctors to stop, he remained in Florida with the dog Harap. Subsequently, both of his legs were amputated, but it was not sufficient to save him. In May 1915, he died. Delay Dumitru Dan was forced to put his trip on hold due to the outbreak of World War I, but he completed his voyage by 1923. The value of the prize was substantially diminished, given inflation over 15 years and from the War. According to a 2011 Romanian news article, it had been worth about 500,000 Euros in 1908, but was only worth 40,000 at the time it was awarded. He crossed five continents over three oceans, through 76 countries and over 1,500 cities, wearing out 497 pairs of shoes. Controversy Drumitu Dan‚Äôs version of his walk told late in life during the 1960s and 1970s did not match the account he told to newspapers in 1914 while he was walking in the United States. He instead said he started his walk in 1912, not 1910, with no mention of a race. He said he had only walked in Europe thus far and said in 1913 he served in the Balkan War where he was seriously wounded. He had not been to Africa, Asia, South and Central America, Australia, Russia, and Alaska as he claimed later in life. He instead said in 1914 that he took up the walk again that year after recovering. This was the first year with proof of photographs, newspaper articles, and certificates. In 1914-15 he walked in England and Scotland, America, the Caribbean, and finally in Spain. Paul Parvu did not walk with him 60,000 miles from Romania. Parvu was from Cleveland, Ohio, where Dan met him for the first time in 1914. They walked together for only three months. Parvu did not wound his legs in Alaska, and did not die in Florida, After Washington D.C. Parvu returned to Ohio and lived on. In 1914-15, Dan never mentioned to reporters a race involving the Touring Club of France. No evidence has ever been found about a race involving 200 international participants. Dan said in 1914 he was walking on wager. It is estimated that Dan actually only walked about 5,000 miles, but for some reason added to his story later in life.Races Around the World on Foot ‚Äì Dumitru Dan Legacy and later life Dan died in BuzƒÉu, Romania in 1978. He is buried in the Heroes' Cemetery. In 1985, his record was entered into the Guinness Book. References  Further reading  * Proiectul Ocolul lumii pe jos.

Its length measures 3.6 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are very obliquely deeply immersed in the first of the succeeding turns, above which only the tilted edge of the last volution projects, which gives the spire a decidedly truncated aspect. The six whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded, slightly shouldered at the summit. They are marked by a raised spiral thread at the decidedly angulated periphery. The summits of the whorls fall a little anterior to the periphery, and cause the sutures to appear subchanneled. The base of the shell is short and well rounded. The entire surface of base and spire are marked by strongly retractive lines of growth and numerous closely spaced spiral striations. The aperture is oval. The posterior angle is acute.

Research Together with Christoph Adami, he defined the quantum version of conditional and mutual entropies, which are basic notions of Shannon's information theory, and discovered that quantum information can be negative (a pair of entangled particles was coined a qubit-antiqubit pair). This has led to important results in quantum information sciences, for example quantum state merging. He is best known today for his work on quantum information with continuous variables. He found a Gaussian quantum cloning transformation (see no-cloning theorem) and invented a Gaussian quantum key distribution protocol, which is the continuous counterpart of the so-called BB84 protocol, making a link with Shannon's theory of Gaussian channels. This has led to the first experimental demonstration of continuous-variable quantum key distribution with optical coherent states and homodyne detection. Honors He received the Caltech President‚Äôs Fund Award in 1997, and the Marie Curie Excellence Award in 2006.

Accounts and fees Although it is free to make a caregiver account on the site, there are limitations in not having a paid membership. For example, after one sends out an application for a job, one will be prompted, thereafter, to \\"triple [one's] chances\\" of being hired, by sending the potential employer a personal message. If one does not have a paid membership, one will be immediately redirected to the \\"purchase membership\\" page, upon clicking. If one chooses to go back in one's browser, the application page will still say \\"You sent a message to [employer name] on [present date].\\" Additionally, if one is redirected here through, as an example, indeed and clicks the \\"apply\\" prompt beside the job posting, one will be redirected to the \\"create an account\\" page (with an account this prompt reads, instead, as \\"I'm interested.\\" Regardless, the prompt below it will read \\"I'm not interested\\"). This first page asks one for one's full name, one's postal code, one's gender, one's date of birth, and one's caregiving-of-interest (animals, children, elderly, etc.). Upon completing this page, one will be requested to supply an email. Following this, one can choose to submit a photograph. This step is optional. Then, as before, one will be sent to the \\"purchase membership\\" page, in this case a fourth option is present: \\"limited\\". Hereafter, however, this final option is gone. After the membership page, one will be prompted to create a user profile for the specified caregiving-of- interest. One can choose to apply for a premium membership at any point upon completion of account creation. Prices are as follows: *1 month for $39 *3 months for $78 (effectively paying $26 per month) *12 months for $156 (effectively paying only $13 per month) The fineprint reads that all payments are automatically renewed unless one's subscription is cancelled, but all prices also include GST/HST. Additionally, there are discount coupons for membership payments. Controversies Founding Immediately prior to founding Care.com Marcelo was an Entrepreneur in residence at Matrix Partners. While there, she and Matrix partner Nick Beim met with the founders of Sittercity.com and Sitters.com, two existing websites for finding caregivers which had been founded years earlier. The purpose of the meetings were to discuss a potential investment and bringing Marcelo in as CEO. Matrix Partners did not invest in either firm and, months later, Marcelo would found Care.com and receive $3.5 million in Series A funding from Matrix Partners, with Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn also participating in that round. The situation has been cited as a noted example of VCs misleading entrepreneurs they meet with and using the information for their own benefit against the entrepreneurs. Mike Cravens, founder of Sitters.com, is quoted as saying that the meetings Marcelo and Beim had with him \\"were more than just a couple of meetings... the reality is that they did a deep dive into my company and then used that information to jump-start Care.com\\". Cravens furnished the Boston Globe with emails from Marcelo in which she tells Craven that she would not entertain starting her own business which would compete with Sitters.com. Anne Raimondi, a spokesperson for Matrix, responded that: ‚ÄúWe can appreciate that the companies in question do not like competition, but we do not believe that their claims of unfair treatment are at all merited because both Sheila and we said from the earliest discussions with these companies that we were considering competitive options and not to share any information with us that they were not comfortable sharing.‚ÄùScott Kirsner, \\"The Backstory: On Care.com, Sittercity, Entrepreneurs, and Entrepreneurs-in-Residence,\\" Boston.com, November 23, 2009. Allegations of insufficient background checks In 2015 The Boston Globe reported on the case of a local couple who found that the woman they had hired through Care.com as a nanny had stolen almost $300,000 over the year she worked for them by forging checks on the couple's personal accounts. The couple had paid $79 for a \\"preferred plus\\" background check that came back clean, despite the woman's lengthy history of fraud and theft arrests around the Boston area, a record the newspaper had been able to find using resources available to the public. While background checks in Massachusetts are more difficult to run than those in other states since court records are not available online, the Globe found other instances elsewhere in the U.S. where families were suing Care.com alleging negligence in properly conducting background checks, including two where the sitter hired was facing criminal charges over the death of the child they were hired to watch. Three years later a Medium writer, Edwin Dorsey, found three additional cases where sitters hired through Care.com, with prior criminal records, had faced charges and lawsuits in the deaths of children under their care, as well as other cases of abuse. He tested the site by setting up a profile himself as Harvey Weinstein, a movie producer then facing many allegations of sexual assault and rape; not only was it approved but he was offered the chance to sign up for CareForce, meaning the listing would turn up in search engine results from off the site. His claim to be certified in CPR and first aid were also accepted without any requests for verification. In March 2019 The Wall Street Journal reported that claims by many day care providers listed on the site as licensed in their state were, in fact, not; at one in Tennessee a woman's twins had drowned, and other children had been abused, physically and sexually. Overbilling claims and scams onsite Dorsey found from public records request filed with various states' attorneys general (AG) that complaints alleging overbilling were widespread. Both families seeking caregivers and those offering such services told the AGs that they had found that their accounts, initially free, had been set to renew automatically every month. Some were unable to cancel their accounts through Care.com's website, and even those that did, through it or contacts with the company's customer service department, reported that their credit cards continued to be billed even after they had disputed the charge with their credit card companies. Some users reported that they found the charges were continued on cards they, or family members, had never used on the site. Other Care.com users claimed they had been taken by scammers exploiting the site. A common scheme was for someone to say they were moving to the mark's area and send them a bad check with instructions to deposit it into their account and send a check on their account to a third party; the intent is for the scammers to receive a good check and cash it before the mark's bank finds the first check is no good. Some victims reported receiving death threats from the scammers if they did not comply; Care.com was, complainants said, indifferent to their complaints. Customer Service On the review site trustpilot.com the company has a 1 star rating for their customer service. Several consumers have complained that they were unable to log in after paying, getting charged more than once, customer service ignoring their emails, etc. Trust Pilot \\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/care.com\\" Care.com Reviews.

It was described by The Scotsman critic, Kate Copstick, as a \\"powerful comedy voice\\" and \\"stunningly hard-hitting\\". and was a Critics' Choice in The Times. Clark's next show, The Jim Davidson Guide to Equality, was based upon comparisons between Jim Davidson's stand-up and Tony Blair's manifesto speeches. A teenage experience of appearing on Jim'll Fix It with Jimmy Savile provided the basis for Jim Fixed It for Me, performed at the 2006 Edinburgh Festival. Clark's show at the 2007 Edinburgh Festival, 12% Evil, used video clips and Powerpoint slides to ridicule common clich√©s and stereotypes about disabled people. Spastic Fantastic (2008), charted Clark's mission, as someone who has cerebral palsy, to rescue the word ‚Äòspastic‚Äô through various means, including the use of secret cameras. Health Hazard (2011), focused on the dangers of privatising the British National Health Service. He won a commission from the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad to produce a new show in that year. Clark also occasionally performs as part of the comedy group \\"Abnormally Funny People\\", with Steve Best, Liz Carr, Tanyalee Davis, Chris McCausland, Steve Day and Simon Minty. Television Clark has appeared on \\"Are You Having A Laugh? TV and Disability\\" (BBC2); The Heaven and Earth Show (BBC 1); Embarrassing Bodies (Channel 4); The London Programme (ITV); The Shooting Party (Channel 4) and I'm With Stupid (BBC 3). In October 2004 he was a reporter on Newsnight (BBC 2), presenting a short film about disability and the UK Abortion Act. Clark and his family are the subject of a documentary film as part of BBC 1's Beyond Disability season called ‚ÄòWe Won't Drop the Baby‚Äô to be screened on 25 March 2012 on BBC 1, narrated by David Tennant. Stage On stage Clark has acted with Graeae Theatre Company, playing Richard in their forum theatre play The Trouble with Richard. He also appeared in David Thacker‚Äôs A Midsummer Night's Dream at Bolton's Octagon Theatre, about which the Guardian said \\"his wheelchair-assisted Wall is indeed ‚Äòthe wittiest partition that I ever heard discourse.‚Äô\\" Personal life Laurence Clark lives in Liverpool with his wife and two children.

Generally found in wetlands in northern latitudes, it bears yellow flowers in summer, which are pollinated by insects. Taxonomy Ranunculus allenii was first described by American botanist Benjamin Lincoln Robinson in 1905, who noted collections in Quebec and Labrador, the first being by one John Alpheus Allen on 23 July 1881 on Mount Albert in the Gasp√© Peninsula. Previously it had been treated as R. affinis or R. pedatifidis, or a larger form of R. pygmaeus. Robinson named the species in honour of its first collector.  Description  Ranunculus allenii grows to about in length, and is a perennial herb that is caespitose (grows in dense clumps). The roots are filiform (very thin in diameter), approximately 0.2 to 0.8 mm thick. Ranunculus allenii grows from a caudex (a thick short stem at ground level), with trichomes that either lay flat or spread out. Its basal leaves are mostly reniform (kidney shaped) and marcescent, while the cauline leaves (leaves of the stem) are linear and are positioned alternately. The petioles connecting the leaf blade to the stem are about 50 to 80 mm long. Leaf blades are flat, about 14 to 21 mm in length and 17 to 28 mm in width, and have a smooth surface on top but are pubescent beneath. The leaf veins are palmate, meaning several veins arise from a single point near the petiole attachment. The flowers can be either solitary or in an inflorescence of 2 to 4 medium-sized flowers. Each flower has 5 sepals that are about 2 to 3 mm long and 4 to 6 mm wide, the calyx is covered with small, white or translucent hairs, and has 5 yellow, obovate, petals that are about 4 to 5 mm long and 2 to 4 mm wide. Each flower has about 20‚Äì30 stamens with filaments that are smooth. Further, it has ovate nectaries, a hairy receptacle that is 3 to 5 mm long, about 60 to 80 apocarpous (free) carpels. There is only one ovule and stigma per ovary, the styles are straight, and the fruit stalk, 4 to 7 mm long, is dry.  Distribution and habitat  Allen's buttercup lives in North America, primarily in low-arctic areas. Its distribution in Canada is limited to Labrador, Nunavut, Quebec and the Arctic Archipelago. Unfortunately, its range is decreasing at this time. Ranunculus allenii is a perennial plant that grows mainly in wet environments, for example, wet meadows, marshes, and streams. However, it occasionally inhabits gravelly and sandy sites with little organic soil.  Importance to humans  There is little-to-no information on human use of Allen's buttercup, perhaps because it is poisonous and may cause skin irritations, as is characteristic of several other members of the genus Ranunculus. Other members of the Ranunculaceae are also known to cause chemical burns by acting as DNA polymerase inhibitors. Aside from these potentially harmful effects, this plant may have been used as a traditional medicine. Aboriginal peoples of British Columbia used buttercup leaves and juice for treating for boils, skin sores, muscular pain, colds and respiratory ailments. The leaves and juice of Bulbous buttercup, which is also a member of the Ranunculaceae, have similarly been used for medical purposes and the root is edible after it is boiled.  Importance to ecosystem (family Ranunculaceae)  Due to the structure of the buttercup flowers, they are often pollinated by insects. Their petals have lines that direct insect pollinators to the nectar, while directing them across the sticky pollen grains The time of year that they bloom also plays a role in which insects will pollinate them; other members of the Ranunculaceae flower in mid-July. The Ranunculaceae also reproduce by agamospermy, the production of seeds asexually, which ensures that these plants can quickly fill habitats if a single parent plant colonizes.  Conservation  Ranunculus allenii is listed on the Natureserve Global Conservation Status as G3 or vulnerable. This means it is at moderate risk of extinction owing to its restricted range, relatively few populations (<80), recent and widespread declines, or other factors. Allen's Buttercup is also listed as a candidate by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). This plant grows primarily in a protected area. Allen's Buttercup is in the GAP 1 and GAP 2 categories of lands, which means that lands are explicitly protected for biodiversity, which will be beneficial for future survival of this plant.

Born in Trenggalek, East Java, Soeprapto studied law in Jakarta, finding work in the legal system soon after graduating in 1920. After transferring often, in the early 1940s he had reached Pekalongan and become the head of the court for Native Indonesians. Escaping Pekalongan during Operatie Product with the help of a prisoner he had just sentenced, Soeprapto made his way to Yogyakarta and began to work as a prosecutor. When the government moved to Jakarta in 1950, Soeprapto went with it. In January 1951, he was selected to be Prosecutor General of Indonesia, serving until 1 April 1959. As prosecutor general, Soeprapto was noted for trying state ministers and generals despite them outranking him, a quality which Amir Hasan Ketaren of the Prosecutors' Commission finds lacking from subsequent officeholders. He was declared \\"Father of the Prosecutor's Office\\" on 22 July 1967, with a bust of him erected outside the Prosecutor General's Office.  Early life and career  Soeprapto was born in Trenggalek, East Java, Dutch East Indies on 27 March 1894 to Hadiwiloyo, a tax collector, and his wife. He took his elementary studies at a Europesche Lagere School, then considered better than schools for Native Indonesians, eventually graduating in 1914. He then moved to Batavia (modern day Jakarta), where he studied at Rechtschool with future state minister Wongsonegoro. After graduating from the Rechtschool in 1920, Soeprapto went directly to working at the Landraad (court for Native Indonesians) in his hometown. For fifteen years he worked at Landraad in various locations, including in Surabaya, Semarang, Bandung, and Denpasar. He eventually rose to Head of the Landraad in Cirebon and Kuningan, serving from 1937 to 1941. From there, he transferred to the Landraad for Salatiga and Boyolali, then to Besuki, before settling as head of the landraad in Pekalongan. While in Pekalongan, Soeprapto befriended a local prosecutor Soekarjo Kario Hatmodjo, father of Hoegeng. Although Soeprapto was able to lead the court peacefully during the Japanese occupation, after the start of the Indonesian National Revolution the situation in Pekalongan became unstable. Although the nascent army was able to hold the peace during riots at the end of 1945, when the Dutch began a major assault on Java, Soeprapto was forced to flee south to Indonesian-held areas with his family. In this, Soeprapto was assisted by Kutil, a man whom he had only recently sentenced to death, and Kutil's other captive accomplices. Soeprapto's wife later remembered that Kutil and his men had \\"carried briefcases containing paperwork related to their cases ... and even [Soeprapto's] children, without showing any vengeance.\\" Although Kutil and his men escaped after evacuating, they were later recaptured, with Soeprapto serving as a witness against them. After his escape from Pekalongan, Soeprapto and his family first went to Cirebon. They then went to Yogyakarta, where Soeprapto became a judge at the high court. He later began work as a prosecutor, rising quickly through the ranks; several of his coworkers attributed it to the Kutil case, where Soeprapto demonstrated that he believed in the supremacy of law. Prosecutor general and later career In 1950, Soeprapto returned to Jakarta and continued his work as a prosecutor. In January 1951, he was chosen to replace Tirtawinata as Prosecutor General of Indonesia. At the time, the prosecutor general's office was a division of the Ministry of Justice, and as such Soeprapto was under the Minister of Justice. During his time as prosecutor general, Soeprapto handled several high-profile cases, going after ministers and generals that outranked him politically. In 1953, he brought Sultan Hamid II, then a minister without portfolio, to trial for his involvement in the APRA Coup d'√©tat; Hamid was sentenced to 10 years in prison by Supreme Court Justice Wirjono Prodjodikoro on 8 April 1953. Soeprapto also investigated Head of the Armed Forces Abdul Haris Nasution for his involvement in the affair. Other cases included the trials of revolutionary groups and foreigners accused of undermining the Indonesian government. He also oversaw an increasing number of prosecutors, drawn from Indonesian law schools. However, Soeprapto also came into conflict with Minister of Justice Moeljatno over the role of the prosecution. Moeljatno took the traditional view that the prosecutor general's office, under the control of the Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period, was in a similar station after independence; on the other hand, Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor general was half executive and half judicial and as such demanded to be accountable only to the cabinet. This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general subservient to the Minister of Justice, which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors and police officers. However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957. After eight years, Soeprapto was honourably dismissed on 1 April 1959. the dismissal has been reported in several sources to be related to the acquittal of/dropping of charges against two foreigners, Junschlager and Schmidt, who had been accused of undermining the government; Junschlager died in prison, and Schmidt was freed on basis of time served in a high court decision which the prosecution did not appeal. As he had not been given prior warning he was unable to go to Merdeka Palace for the related formalities; at the time he was visiting his parents in Yogyakarta. His wife later noted that this led to him becoming disillusioned in President Sukarno's regime. Soeprapto married three times. He first married Soeratinah of Purworejo, with whom he had a son. He then married Djenab Oetari of Bogor, with whom he had a daughter. His last marriage was to Soekarti, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. He died on 2 December 1964, and was buried at Kalibata Heroes Cemetery in Jakarta.  Legacy  Soeprapto was posthumously declared the \\"Father of the Prosecutor's Office\\" on 22 July 1967 by Prosecutor General Soegiharto, which was formally recognized by Letter of Recommendation Number KEP-061/D.A/1967. That same year, a bust of him was placed in front of the prosecutor general's office in Jakarta. Several streets are named after Soeprapto, including in Gresik, Malang, and Surabaya. Amir Hasan Ketaren of the Prosecutors' Commission stated in 2010 that Soeprapto was an example of what a prosecutor general should be: firm, knowledgeable, and unwilling to allow outside intervention in his investigations - even from the president. This quality, he said, was lacking in subsequent officeholders. The following year, Asvi Warman Adam of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences stated that there had yet to be another prosecutor general like Soeprapto, for - rather than investigating cases of corruption and keeping politics out of the position - subsequent holders of the office had often been corrupt themselves.

Biography View of Andrarum Church He was born in the Stora Tuna Parish of Dalarna, Sweden. He was the son of Johan Fahlcrantz and Gustafva De Brenner. His father was a vicar in Kungs√•ra parish. His brothers were the sculptor, Axel Magnus Fahlcrantz (1780‚Äì1854), and the theologian, Christian Eric Fahlcrantz (1780‚Äì1866). His great-grandfather Elias Brenner (1647‚Äì1717) was an artist and draftsman. His great-grandmother Sophia Elisabet Brenner (1659‚Äì1730) was a writer and poet. In 1791, he went to Stockholm and secured an apprenticeship as a decorative painter with at the Royal Dramatic Theatre. After one year, he became a student of Emanuel Limnell and lived with his family until around 1800. He also received guidance from Elias Martin and studied landscape painting with Louis Belanger, who had immigrated from France in 1798. Soon, he began to receive numerous orders for landscapes and vedute, often composed with atmospheric lighting.Konstn√§rslexikonett Amanda - Carl Johan Fahlcrantz He was especially influenced by Martin, who had made study trips to England. Despite his initial success, he had to make ends meet by taking students and selling some paintings at a discount. In 1802, he was named a member candidate (agr√©) at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts and became a member the following year. In 1805, he and Gustaf Erik Hasselgren received stipends from the Academy for a period of four years. He intended to visit Italy but postponed the trip until 1807, when he asked for permission to spend his money within Sweden. This was agreed to on condition that he submit two landscapes to the Academy each year, to show his progress. He continued to receive the stipend as a travel subsidy for foreign trips to Norway (1827) and Denmark (1829). In 1815, he had become a Professor at the Academy. He was also an honorary member of several academies in Europe and the United States. In addition to orders from the Swedish Royal Family, he received several commissions from Tsar Nicholas I.

The Lisbon Strategy After her role of Minister of Employment, Rodrigues was appointed by Prime Minister Ant√≥nio Guterres special advisor and Head of the Prime Minister's Forward Studies Unit in 1998. In this capacity, she played a dramatic role during the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union, in the first semester of 2000. The Portuguese Presidency notably succeeded in securing a compromise on the so-called Lisbon Strategy, a comprehensive plan that was aimed at boosting growth, competitiveness and employment level in the EU building on innovation. The strategy was adopted at an extraordinary European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, a meeting in which Maria Jo√£o Rodrigues acted as a sherpa for the Prime Minister.Magone, Jos√© Mar√≠a. \\"The developing place of Portugal in the European Union\\" Transaction Publishers, 2004, p.34 She notably contributed to build a compromise between the delegations of the British and French governments, by resorting to the open method of coordination. Maria Jo√£o Rodrigues continued to monitor closely the developments of the Lisbon Strategy, in particular as Special Advisor to the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Union for the Mid-term Review of the Lisbon Strategy (2005) and special advisor to the European Commission and Jean-Claude Juncker on the Lisbon strategy. Looking back on this experience in 2010, Rodrigues wrote \\"Even if there were clear failures, the implementation of the Lisbon strategy should not be considered a failure.\\".Lisbon Agenda Group. \\"On the EU2020 agenda: contributions after the Lisbon agenda experience\\" Notre Europe, 2010, p.25 The Lisbon strategy is largely considered to have failures but also some achievements. In 2007, the EU average GR was 2.7% and 16 million jobs have been created. Most of all, it changed the governance of the European Union with higher coordination of economic and social policies, involving around 400 measures. In 2007, Rodrigues was appointed by Prime Minister Jos√© Socrates as special advisor for the European Union Presidency dealing with the Lisbon Treaty, the Lisbon strategy and EU Summits with international partners China, India, Brazil, Russia and Africa. This mission, which achieved the negotiation of the Lisbon Treaty, came to end on 1 January 2008, when the rotating presidency of the European Union was handed to Slovenia. Rodrigues has also started a process of \\"Dialogues for Sustainable Development\\" with these international partners, sponsored by Gulbenkian Foundation. In 2010, the Lisbon Strategy was succeeded by the Europe 2020 strategy, a new EU plan for \\"smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth\\". Although not acting in any official capacity anymore, Rodrigues' previous experiences with the Lisbon strategy meant that her viewpoint on the Europe 2020 was highly valued all across the political spectrum and in many European capitals. Until 2014, Rodrigues was also a Professor at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles and the University of Lisbon. Member of the European Parliament, 2014‚Äì2019 In the 2014 European elections, Rodrigues became a Member of the European Parliament and Vice- President of Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats group, the second most important parliamentary group, along with other nine MEPs. . She also joined the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. In December 2015 Rodrigues was one of the candidates for the Portuguese Council of State (an advisory council to the President of the Republic) in the list put forward by the left-wing parties in the Portuguese parliament, as substitute member. Also in 2015, Rodrigues led the S&D; Group in the European Parliament to adopt detailed positions on the Greek government-debt crisis and on the reform of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union. She was then appointed to chair this debate with the Social Democratic leaders in Europe. In 2017, she obtained a large majority of five political groups in the European Parliament to back her report on \\"The European Pillar of Social Rights\\" and was appointed to the final negotiations; it was proclaimed in the Gothenburg Summit on 17 November 2017. Political positions Rodrigues has also been developing a policy response to the Eurozone crisis, notably with respect to the European Financial Stability Facility and the economic governance of the European Union. In October 2010, she published in European current affairs online newspaper EurActiv a \\"short theatre piece\\" summing up her thoughts on the issue of European Economic Governance, and several other policy papers, reports and books followed. In December 2011, Rodrigues argued for the use of a \\"big bazooka\\" to address the eurozone crisis, in the form of a large scale government debt purchase by the European Central Bank.

() is a clinical-stage publicly traded predictive drug discovery and development company headquartered in Israel, with shares traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Compugen was established as computational drug discovery service provider in 1993. Compugen originally acted as service provider for pharma companies, supplying its software and computational services to predict different types of biological phenomena. It had arrangements with big pharmas such as Novartis AG, Abbot Laboratories and Pfizer Inc.Spotlight on Israel: Compugen Comes Forth, Script Magazine, April 24, 2018 Subsequently, Compugen made a decision to become a drug development company with its own internal pipeline, and in 2010, decided to a focus on oncology and immunology.BioWorld Today, Compugen Rockets on $540M Bayer Immunotherapy Alliance, August 6, 2013 OncoMed Pharmaceuticals and Five Prime Therapeutics are among Compugen's competitors.  History Compugen was founded by Eli Mintz, Simchon Faigler and Amir Natan. Mintz conceived of the idea for the company in 1991 while accompanying his wife, Liat Mintz, to a genomics engagement at the Pasteur Institute in France. She commented that the quantities of data being produced by scientists involved in DNA sequencing exceeded what computers could process at reasonable speeds. Eli Mintz partnered with colleagues Faigler and Natan from the IDF's elite Talpiot program to develop a more powerful specialized processor for sequence similarity searches; and the company's first product, dubbed the \\"Bioccelerator\\", had speeds up to one thousand times faster than other platforms being used at the time. In 1997, the company followed this success by introducing LEADS, an EST clustering and assembly platform. By around 2001, Compugen had effected a shift in its business model from a company whose almost exclusive focus was marketing computer programs and applications to one whose operations extended into the diagnostics and therapeutics fields. In 2010, under Dr. Cogen-Dayag‚Äôs new leadership, the company shifted its business model to become a fully integrated biopharma company using its developed computational biology discovery technology to identify novel targets and develop its own pipeline of immuno-oncology drugs.Globes, ◊ì\\"◊® ◊¢◊†◊™ ◊õ◊î◊ü-◊ì◊ô◊ô◊í ◊û◊°◊§◊®◊™ ◊ê◊ô◊ö ◊î◊ó◊ñ◊ô◊®◊î ◊ê◊™ ◊ß◊ï◊û◊§◊ô◊ï◊í'◊ü ◊û◊î◊™◊î◊ï◊ù ,22.11.2015 Compugen began trading on the Nasdaq in 2000 and on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2002.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Chorley, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It was a Commissioners' church, having received a grant towards its construction from the Church Building Commission. History The church was built between 1822 and 1825 to a design by Thomas Rickman. A grant of ¬£12,387 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) was given towards its construction by the Church Building Commission. It was originally a chapel of ease to the mother church of St Laurence, and became a separate parish in 1856. Later three more parishes were created within its boundaries, St Peter, which had earlier been a district within the parish, St James in 1879, and All Saints in the 1950s. Architecture Exterior St George's is constructed in ashlar stone with a slate roof. Its architectural style is Early English. The plan consists of a nave and chancel in one cell with a clerestory, north and south aisles, and a west tower. The tower is in four stages with angle buttresses rising to octagonal pinnacles. It has a west doorway under a crocketed gable above which is a tall lancet window. In three sides of the third stage are clock faces. In the top stage are arcades of tall lancets, the outer ones being blind. The parapet is embattled. The nave and aisles are in seven bays. The bays of the aisles are separated by buttresses rising to pinnacles, and each bay contains a pair of lancet windows. Each bay of the clerestory also contains a pair of lancets. The east window consists of five stepped lancets. Interior Inside the church the arcades are carried on eight thin piers. There are galleries on three sides carried on cast iron pillars, their fronts being decorated with tracery. The ceiling is flat, carried on cast iron, decorated hammerbeams. At the west end of the north aisle is a baptistry containing a white marble font consisting of an angel carrying a scalloped bowl. The octagonal sculpted pulpit was made by Thomas Rawcliffe of Chorley. The eagle lectern is a memorial to the church's first vicar. The stained glass in the east window is also to the first vicar's memory and is dated 1875. There is a window in the south chancel wall dated 1877, and windows in the north chancel wall dated 1914 and 1920. The glass in the west window is by Stephen Adam, and depicts the Resurrection. The chandeliers were installed in 1977, having previously been in St Mary's Church, Ulverston. The clock in the tower was installed in 1920. The three-manual organ was made in about 1870 by Kirtland and Jardine, with modifications by E. Walklet in 1934. The bells consist of an Ellacombe Chime, made by Mears and Stainbank at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, and installed in 1919.

The station was established in 1983 as \\"WJED\\", and changed to \\"WSTN\\" in 1986. Since 2002 its broadcast license has been held by Jimmy Swaggart's Family Worship Center Church, Inc. The station went silent on October 25, 2006. Programming Before falling silent, WSTN broadcast a Gospel music format to Fayette County and Memphis, Tennessee, as an affiliate of Jimmy Swaggart's SonLife Radio Network. History Launch In September 1979, Fayette County Broadcasting Company applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit for a new class B broadcast radio station to operate with 500 watts of power on a frequency of 1410 kHz. The FCC granted this permit on June 19, 1981, with a scheduled expiration date of June 19, 1982. The new station was assigned call sign \\"WJED\\" on December 1, 1981. After construction and testing were completed, the station was granted its broadcast license on February 25, 1983. WJED era In May 1984, Fayette County Broadcasting Company applied to the FCC to transfer the WJED license to the similarly named Fayette County Broadcasting Company, Inc. The FCC approved the move on May 31, 1984, and the transaction was formally consummated on August 29, 1984. Almost immediately, Fayette County Broadcasting Company, Inc., made a deal to sell WJED to Floyd Broadcasting, Inc., but this request was ultimately dismissed on December 6, 1984, at the request of Floyd Broadcasting. Fayette County Broadcasting Company, Inc., made another bid to sell the station in May 1986, this time to Fayette County Broadcasting Service. The FCC approved the deal on July 8, 1986, and the transaction was formally consummated on August 8, 1986. The new owners had the FCC assign the station new call sign \\"WSTN\\" on September 22, 1986. WSTN era In June 1989, Fayette County Broadcasting sold the station to C.I.T.A. Broadcasters, Inc. The sale received FCC approval on August 24, 1989, and the deal was formally consummated on October 23, 1989. In April 1995, C.I.T.A. Broadcasting, Inc., made a deal to transfer the WSTN broadcast license to Fayette County Broadcasting. The move was approved by the FCC on June 13, 1995, and consummated on August 21, 1995. In November 1996, Fayette County Broadcasting made a deal to sell WSTN to Patria Communications, Inc., but even though the deal gained FCC acceptance on March 12, 1997, the transaction was never consummated and control of WSTN remained with Fayette County Broadcasting. On May 3, 2002, Fayette County Broadcasting's Pat Roberson signed a contract to sell WSTN and its assets to the Jimmy Swaggart-owned Family Worship Center Church, Inc., for a total of $50,000. As part of the deal, Family Worship Center Church immediately took over operation of the station under a local marketing agreement while the sale was pending. WSTN became an affiliate of Jimmy Swaggart's SonLife Radio Network. The FCC approved the sale on September 5, 2002, and the transaction was consummated on December 4, 2002. Falling silent WSTN went temporarily dark on October 25, 2006, after license holder Family Worship Center Church, Inc., got into a dispute with the leaseholder of the station's broadcast tower site that made it, in the licensee's words, \\"impossible to operate the radio station\\". The FCC granted the station special temporary authority to remain silent on October 30, 2006, with a scheduled expiration on January 30, 2007. In January 2007, the dispute was not resolved so the station requested an extension which was granted on January 18, 2007, with a new expiration date on April 30, 2007. In April 2007, the station reported that the dispute was not yet resolved and that they were seeking alternative transmitter sites in case no resolution could be reached. The FCC granted them an additional extension on May 1, 2007, with an expiration of August 1, 2007. Normally, under the provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, any broadcast station that fails to operate for one full year is subject to automatic forfeiture and cancellation of their broadcast license. At the licensee's request, WSTN's license was cancelled on April 5, 2012.

Aftenposten called the group's 23 November 1944 ship sabotage \\"the largest Norwegian sabotage attack during World War Two\\", which included the blowing up of 6 ships and one crane at two ship yards. The attack possibly significantly decreased the number of soldiers from the retreating Lapland Army who were made available at the Battle of the Ardennes, according to Lars Borgersrud. 16 operations have been attributed to the group. 7 of its members were executed in 1945. The leader was Ragnar \\"Pelle\\" Sollie,I skyggen av tungtvannet - Pelle-gruppa gjennomf√∏rte en av krigens dristigste sabotasjeaksjoner p√• to verft p√• Aker brygge. ‚Äì Dette anslaget hadde st√∏rre praktisk betydning for utfallet av krigen enn tungtvannsaksjonen. [In the shadow of the heavy water - the Pelle Group pulled off one of the war's most daring sabotage attacks at two shipyards at Aker Brygge. - This attack had greater practical significance for the outcome of the war, than the attack on the heavy water production facility] the only one in the group who was a member of Communist Party of Norway.NRK Gulls side om Ragnar Sollie og Pellegruppa A 2015 Klassekampen article said that the group‚Äîalongside the Osvald Group‚Äîwere \\"not ¬´communist¬ª but they were led by\\" the communists Ragnar Sollie and [in the case of the Osvald Group,] Asbj√∏rn ¬´Osvald¬ª Sunde\\". History In the summer of 1944 the group attacked a mechanics factory at Fetsund; one member was killed when dynamite ignited ahead of schedule. The group's finances were provided by robbing an office that was responsible for paying salaries to company employees‚ÄîOslo Sporveiers l√∏nnskontor. The take was Norwegian kroner 125 000. 23 November 1944 attack The 23 November 1944 sabotage attack resulted in the blowing up of 6 ships, one crane, two drydocks‚Äîat two ship yards (Nylands VerkstedNylands Verksted and Akers Mekaniske Verksted). The explosions were preceded by two tons of dynamite being smuggled from Sollih√∏gda into Oslo, after the dynamite was stolen by Leif Kjemperud and others. (Responsibility for the smuggling, was had by a subdivision of the Pelle Group‚Äîthe Ullev√•l Hageby Gang. Sverre Kokkin and others bicycled, with dynamite, from H√∏nefoss to Oslo. Dynamite was also transported to Oslo by lorry, hidden in potato sacks. \\"When the lorry was stopped at check point, they only saw potatoes. During transfer and reloading, one of the sacks opened\\" and dynamite spilled onto the sidewalk, and the driver did not know what he had been a part of.) The dynamite was stored at Kampen, Oslo by a different subdivision of the group. Shipyard employees smuggled the dynamite into their workplace, where it was stored under one of the \\"boats\\". At the shipyard, workers and foremen brought the explosives onto the ship, in pockets, lunch boxes and tool boxes. The six ships destroyed included one war ship‚Äî\\"Bolivar\\", and M/S Troma (owned by a Norwegian firm). \\"... var i n√¶rheten da aksjonen ble utf√∏rt. - Det var derimot de fem skipsbyggerne Ellef Baastad, Osvald Kristiansen, Gunnar Andersen, Johan Gr√∏nholdt og Erik Marcussen, alle oppl√¶rt av Ragnar 'Pelle' Sollie. ... Etter krigen byttet tre av de fem navn.\\" The workers at the shipyards who smuggled the dynamite, were able to escape to Sweden. Of five shipwrights who participated after being trained by Sollie, three changed their name after the war. (The five shipwrights were Ellef Baastad, Osvald Kristiansen, Gunnar Andersen, Johan Gr√∏nholdt and Erik Marcussen.) After the 23 November 1944 attack During late winter of 1945, a woman who had an affair with one of the group's members reported to authorities that the man had a gunshot wound to the stomach. The man and his brother were arrested by the Gestapo. The brothers \\"were not able to take the torture. Within an hour and a half, Gestapo were on their way to our home\\", said Sverre Kokkin. 11 of its members were sentenced to death ‚Äî 7 were executed in February and March 1945. Several members were executed at the Akershus Fortress and their bodies thrown into the Oslofjord. Organization The group had about 100 saboteurs. Subdivisions of the group included the Ullev√•l Hageby Gang and the Losby Gang. After the war Recognition No member has ever received medals for their actions during World War II, from Norway's government. In 2013 one of the two members who is still alive, Sverre Kokkin said that if he gets a medal, it probably will be post mortem. In a 2013 article on NRK, √òystein Rakkenes and Morten Conradi (directors of a 2013 film about the Pelle Group) said \\"... why [Max] Manus has been credited for the big ship sabotage action (skipssabotasjeaksjonen ) in 1944 at the port of Oslo?\\"Uverdig behandling av hvem, Moland? Hjemmefrontmuseets leder bommer fullstendig p√• m√•let i sin kritikk av v√•r film om Pellegruppa. Det er ikke Max Manus som har blitt uverdig behandlet. The directors also said \\"It was first when the members of Pelle Group‚ÄîSverre Kokkin and Leif Kjemperud‚Äîprotested in 2010, that the monument [of Max Manus] at last was moved to Akershus festning\\"‚Äî[from the site of the 1944 ship sabotage at present day Aker Brygge]. Later in 2013 Ronald Bye‚Äîa former Party Secretary of the Labour Party‚Äîwrote in Norwegian daily Aftenposten that \\"It is not about the content of an obituary, a lunch with the defence minister who presented a tray as a gift, and that now (November 22) there will be unveiled a monument to commemorate the Pelle Group. It is about the 'retouching' of the group's members in regards to an official recognition for the efforts on behalf of the Resistance. The reason; the members were stigmatized and many of them were put under surveillance as communists‚Äîin lee of the hunt for fifth columnists during the Cold War... But my point is to front the criticism of the bad treatment that the Pelle Group officially got from Norwegian authorities. For example this was expressed by not being granted honors such as Den norsk deltakermedaljen, War Cross, Forsvarsmedaljen, Forsvarets hederskors, and Haakon VIIs 70-√•rsmedalje. - These are honours that‚Äîwith a generous hand‚Äîhas been awarded to others who participated in the Resistance fight during the war.\\" A 30 October 2013 Dagsavisen article quoted from a speech (honoring the group) by the former minister of defence: \\"Who chose to follow the narrow path of courage ... And here were people from the entire political spectrum. Still, the cold relationship between East and West came to make life difficult for some. We know that some in the Pelle Group were inflicted with unreasonably great strain. In the clear light of hindsight, this is something that we today can confirm.\\" \\"Som valgte √• f√∏lge motets smale sti ... Og her var mennesker fra hele det politisk spekter. Likevel kom det kalde forholdet mellom √∏st og vest til √• gj√∏re livet vanskeligere for noen. Vi vet at flere i Pelle-gruppen ble p√•f√∏rt urimelig stor belastning. Det er noe vi i dag i ettertidens klare lys kan fastsl√•.\\" In 2015 Lars Borgersrud said that \\"Norwegian war history has focused on sabotage attacks performed and planned from England\\" [...] They were trained by professional soldiers, by the British. The saboteurs of the Pelle Group and the Osvald Group, were ordinary people who had no access to weapons and equipment, other than what they were able to get their hands on. Their effort can not be evaluated in the same manner. [...] To compare with those who operated in Norway, independently from Milorg, becomes difficult. Usually this was workers who sabotaged their own firms\\". =Monument in Oslo= In 2010, the city council of Oslo passed a resolution to build a monument to honor the Pelle group. In December 2011, 3 members of the Pelle group criticized the council's Finance committee for not allocating the \\"originally proposed Norwegian kroner 1.75 million\\" in the proposed budget for 2012. In 2013 Aftenposten said that three years ago Max Manus was honored with a monument at Aker Brygge, and that the \\"Placement led to protest, since it was the Pelle Group that performed the sabotage of ships here. The monument was therefore moved to below Akershus Fortress, where Max Manus led the sabotage attack on [steamship] Donau. - But the commotion regarding the placement, put the Pelle Group on the map. The city council decided that the Pelle Group also would receive a monument, and that it was to be placed at Aker Brygge.\\" It was financed by a Norwegian firm‚ÄîSamlerhuset. After completion On 22 November 2013 the monument was unveiled, after a ceremony in the city hall of Oslo with crown prince Haakon and Oslo's mayor sitting alongside Reidar Formo and Sverre Kokkin (the two last surviving member of the Pelle Group). The names of 63 persons are listed on the monument, including saboteurs of the group and facilitators. Klassekampen has highlighted tireless effort, regarding the monument, by Erling Folkvord, historian Lars Borgersrud, Morten Conradi and √òystein Rakkenes, and mentioning Gunnar S√∏nsteby as an ally to the project. A description of the monument says that it \\"... shows two young men running with banner and rifle; and a women carrying a handbag with illegal newspapers\\". Members The group had only one who was a member of Norges Kommunistiske Parti ‚Äî Ragnar Sollie. Leif Kjemperud was also a member of Osvald Group. Ludvig Hansen was the group's youngest, around 18 years old.  Hageby Gang Members of the Hageby Gang, also known as the Ullev√•l Hageby Gang included Sverre Kokkin Reidar Formoe was the designated executioner of group members who were wounded and supposedly would not be able to escape the scene of attack.

The novel received mostly positive reviews. Plot Yuji Takano is a writer in 1940s Tokyo. The story focuses on Takano's exploration and discovery of \\"Western\\" culture, exemplified in the meetings of the \\"club\\" which he forms with his French- speaking friends. The novel examines the effects on Takano's life and relationships of the impending events of World War II, and the possibility of conscription. Reception The novel received mostly positive acclaim, with reviewers praising Millers evocation of the Eastern world and its intricacies; and Millers \\"delicate\\" prose. Detractors of the novel cited two-dimensional characters and some confusing moments as the main faults. In a review for Pop Matters, David Pullar stated the novel was \\"clever, responsible and just plain well-written\\"; that it is an \\"imaginative and profound reflection on Japanese identity in the early days of the Second World War\\"; stating of the novel as a whole \\"Miller‚Äôs depiction of a Japanese world that largely passed with the American occupation is vivid and enticing\\" and awarding it a score of eight out of ten. Reviewing for The Daily Telegraph, Helen Brown felt the novel was \\"convincingly Japanese\\", stating \\"there are moments of beauty, truth and irony\\" and \\"Miller places his words and plot developments carefully\\". She did, however, find the \\"distillation of things down to their universal essence can slow the pace\\" and found that she \\"got a bit bored following Yuji about the city\\". Peter Carty, reviewing for The Independent, stated \\"Miller's trademark is silken prose which gleams with acutely rendered detail\\" and that \\"when this stylistic fluency is brought to bear on Yuji, the result is a character so well realised as to engage all of our sympathies\\". He does temper this somewhat, however, stating, of the novel as a whole, \\"mostly, he is supremely successful, although his massings of humanity can be confusing, and there is a sense of a frustrating compression\\". In another review for The Telegraph, reviewer Harriet Paterson viewed the novel in a more critical light. She stated that \\"Yuji remains an unremarkable figure\\", that \\"Miller does quite a line in tortured males, but in this case Yuji's self-absorbed ennui is not interesting enough to carry the narrative\\" and that the plot continues \\"without [him] ever fleshing out into a three-dimensional character\\". Paterson did find that parts of the novel were written in a \\"delicate prose\\", however found that \\"they are too sporadic to create an overall texture\\". In conclusion she states \\"The obvious enjoyment with which Miller brought the 18th century to life for his books Casanova and Ingenious Pain is missing. The drama of the historical setting gets lost along the way, having promised a more compelling novel than ultimately emerges\\".

Southfield Village was torn down following the 1993 shooting of a little 7-year-old girl attending her friends' birthday party. During the party, in which the participants were out in the back yard, the girl was shot during crossfire from members of The Nation gang. Although there had been past violence in Southfield Village, this shooting signalled the beginning of the end of the housing complex. Southfield Village existed well before 1954 as a series of two-story buildings housing low-income people.

Jaleco published Goal! and Super Goal! for the Super NES (SNES) in December 1992, shortly after Goal Two! for the NES. The cover model is John Brady, an amateur soccer player from London who was living in Chicago. For the French release of the NES version, Jaleco secured an endorsement from French international footballer Eric Cantona, who had just transferred to Manchester United F.C.. The French packaging bears the name and likeness of Cantona, with the prefixed title Eric Cantona Football Challenge: Goal! 2. The SNES title Eric Cantona Football Challenge, however, is an internationalization of Striker (Rage Software 1992). Goal! Two is Tose's first sequel to the NES title Goal! (1989). Goal! for NES is a localization of Moero 5!! Pro Soccer (1988), the fifth installment in the long-running Moero!! sports game series. The Goal! video game series is a spin-off of the Japanese Moero!! series. Jaleco followed [Super] Goal! with Super Goal! 2 (1994), a localization of Takeda Nobuhiro no Super Cup Soccer (1993). An additional Super Famicom installment, Takeda Nobuhiro no Super League Soccer (1994) was published only in Japan. Gameplay Players choose a national men's team from a list of 25 countries (a net increase of eight compared with Goal! for NES). Like Goal! for NES, Goal! Two is not endorsed by any football team or federation, so kit colors are inauthentic. In addition to a \\"Super Cup\\" tournament mode, the game allows for exhibition matches for a single-player, or for two players playing either competitively or cooperatively. However, whereas Goal! for NES has a shoot-out mode, Goal! Two and [Super] Goal! do not. In this sequel, Tose made several presentational changes: They adjusted the perspective of the football pitch; increased the size of the football player sprites and goals; enlivened the interstitial animation; and improved the game music and sound effects. Among the functional changes to the game are a choice of team formations and the ability to choose the team's 11 members from a roster of 15.

He was a catholic priest, co-founder and general of the Resurrectionists, where he was the creator of the main spiritual ideas of the Congregation (Resurrectionist School of Spirituality). As a philosopher and theologian, he was regarded as one of the most scholarly Polish members of the Roman Catholic Church in the second half of the 19th century. He was the author of many philosophical and theological works, as well as on the interior life. He left a massive correspondence, as well as a personal diary. Biography Peter Semenenko was born into a Ruthenian familyBilenky, Serhiy. Romantic Nationalism in Eastern Europe: Russian, Polish, and Ukrainian Political Imaginations, Stanford University Press, 2012, p. 153, on June 29, 1814 in Dziƒôcio≈Çowo in north-east Poland. In 1830, he started his studies at the University of Wilno in the Department of Philosophy, but soon interrupted them because he decided to join the November Uprising against Russian invaders. He emigrated to France in 1832. While in Paris, he met Bogdan Ja≈Ñski in 1833, who soon became his spiritual director and master. Under his influence, Semenenko returned to the Catholic faith and became the first member of the ‚ÄúJa≈Ñski House‚Äù in 1836, which was the beginning of the Congregation of the Resurrection. After the early death of Ja≈Ñski in 1840 in Rome, Semenenko was elected the first superior and spiritual leader of the new community. When he finished his theological studies at the Collegium Romanum (1837‚Äì41), he was ordained to the priesthood on December 5, 1841. Congregation of the Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ As a co-founder of the order, he wrote the rule of 1842 and was the principal editor of the (1850 - 1880) rule.

Between 1865-1938, many alumni of the college accepted and adopted Resurrectionist spirituality. Many also went on to become outstanding priests, bishops, archbishops, and cardinals, some of whom have been beatified or canonized. E.g. J√≥zef DƒÖbrowski, St. J√≥zef Sebastian Pelczar, St. J√≥zef Bilczewski. Collaboration with the Holy See Fr. Peter Semenenko collaborated actively with the Holy See. He was an expert on Polish and Eastern matters and, because of his knowledge, he was held in high esteem by popes Gregory XVI, Pio IX and Leo XIII. He worked as a consultant for the Sacred Congregations: #of the Index (since 1857) #and the Holy Office (since 1873) [now: Doctrine of Faith]. His work was highly praised, and his statements were taken as definitive on a regular basis. He was a member of the following prestigious Papal Academies: #Accademia della Religione Cattolica (since 1859), #and Accademia degli Arcadi (since 1874). He was an outstanding erudite and freely able to discuss even the most subtle problems.

Biography James Brown discovered Tony Cook playing at a block party for the WRDW-AM radio station Brown owned in his childhood hometown of Augusta, Georgia. Cook was an Augusta native who began drumming in his early teens, learning full albums by the likes of Brown, Al Green, Rufus Thomas, Wilson Pickett and Kool & the Gang, and playing in backing bands for touring artists such as Geater Davis and Z.Z. Hill. ‚ÄúHe sat in with us and he took for granted that we knew the songs,‚Äù Cook says of his first encounter with the legendary Godfather of Soul. ‚ÄúSo we played, and from his expression [it seemed] he was a little bit surprised that we could play so well. We were just a bunch of kids. Maybe the oldest one of us was 17. I think I was 15.‚Äù Cook finished high school and was gigging in and around Augusta with a local group called the Liberty Band when Brown and running partner Bobby Byrd were in attendance for a bill the group shared with comedian Clay Tyson. The Godfather had heard that Cook and company were the best outfit in town, and on the strength of their performance that night, hired the crew as his opening act in December 1975. In the early part of 1976, Brown began to retool the JBs and brought Cook aboard as his new drummer, a position the 18-year-old would hold off and on for the next thirty years.http://www.tonycookmusic.com/tcookhistory.htm The hiring came when Brown‚Äôs career was in decline. As work slowed, Cook joined Etta James‚Äôs band, opening for the Rolling Stones and supporting Taj Mahal, James Booker, and Willie Mabon at the 1978 Montreux Jazz Festival before returning to Brown later that year. He stayed with Brown for the next two years until receiving an offer from producer Frank Farian to bring his band Sky Train to Germany and back Jamaican-born vocalist Precious Wilson. After working with Farian, Cook moved to London and went independent, scoring a deal in 1981 with Osceola Records and producing the first Tony Cook and the Party People singles. The next year, he began working with the Halfmoon label, releasing ‚ÄúDo What You Wanna Do‚Äù and later, the seminal ‚ÄúOn the Floor‚Äù and ‚ÄúOn the Floor (Rock-It)‚Äù mixes by WBLS-FM DJs Timmy Regisford and Boyd Jarvis. Cook‚Äôs initial tenure with James Brown came to an end in 1993, although he would return in 2005 and stay until Brown‚Äôs death on Christmas Day in 2006. Cook still performs with his band, Trunk-O-Funk. In June 2014 Tony Cook produced and recorded drums on a song \\"Robo-friend\\" by Russian alternative rock band 208 Talks of Angels. The granddaddy of all house records ‚ÄúOn the Floor‚Äù found Cook successfully merging funk and disco, although that was not the original intent. The drummer-turned-producer was admittedly trying to score a hit, and to do so, chose to ride the other emerging genre of the day. ‚Äú‚ÄòOn the Floor‚Äô was a rap record at first,‚Äù he reveals. ‚ÄúWe put the tracks down in Atlanta, Georgia, then the record company struck a deal and got Timmy Regisford and Boyd Jarvis to mix it. They took the master and re-recorded a few things, added a few things, and came up with the mix that we ended up with. It was quite a bit different from what we put down in the beginning, but I was pleased with the results.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know what to call it, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt a rap record anymore. It had more of a dance kind of thing going through it. And it had a little bit of techno to it. When we released it in 1984, the phrase ‚Äògarage‚Äô came out, then ‚Äòhouse‚Äô came out, and someone called it ‚ÄòThe Granddaddy of all House Records‚Äô, so we knew we had something different and new.‚Äù James Brown, Michael Jackson and Prince Cook was Brown‚Äôs drummer during the historic 1983 concert with B.B. King at the Beverly Theater in Los Angeles, during which Prince and Michael Jackson made impromptu appearances on stage.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHaFj7gOWh4 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he really knew who Prince was at the time,‚Äù Cook says of Brown, who first learned that Jackson was in attendance and called him up onstage. ‚ÄúHe might have known Prince‚Äôs name, but he just didn‚Äôt put a face with it, or didn‚Äôt understand what Michael was talking about.‚Äù ‚ÄúMichael said ‚ÄòPrince‚Äô and Brown probably thought he was talking about another prince‚Ä¶a real prince. That wasn‚Äôt unusual. We‚Äôd go to gigs and anybody might show up.‚Äù Back to Reality In 2010, Stones Throw Records released Cook‚Äôs Back to Reality anthology, a collection of rare and unreleased funk, boogie, and proto-rap from the immediate post-disco era.http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2010/11/tony-cook-back-to-reality Stones Throw founder, Chris ‚ÄúPeanut Butter Wolf‚Äù Manak, first learned of Cook when he found the \\"On the Floor\\" single in a New York City record store in the early 2000s. \\"I was excited because it sounded like the missing link between funk and house music,\\" Manak says. \\"For being released in 1984, to me, it seemed like the first house record.

Background  Azar Gat, argues that this \\"United States Factor\\" is both widely overlooked and the reason for democracy's victory over totalitarianism in the 20th century. According to the United States factor notion, \\"if it were not for the existence of the USA the liberal democracies would most probably have lost the great struggles of the twentieth century.\\"  United States factor in history  The 20th century did appear to witness what many theorists have seen as the end of the battles of political ideology, with the political model of liberal democracy coming out on top. Indeed, political scientists, including Francis Fukuyama, hailed the fall of the Soviet Union as the \\"end of history\\" in which the ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy [becomes] the final form of human government.\\" (See End of History and the Last Man) In the view of the United States factor, this \\"end of history\\" is made possible only because the US was in a unique space economically, geographically, politically, and militarily throughout the 20th century that made it possible for the United States to \\"rescue\\" the Old World powers from the threat of totalitarianism. These menaces included both right wing totalitarian regimes, such as Nazism, as well as left wing totalitarianism‚Äîbetter known as Soviet- era Communism. (See State ideology of the Soviet Union.) Though Gat acknowledges that the victory of democracy over totalitarianism was not necessarily \\"preordained\\" at the outset of either World War, he goes on to remark that the sheer fact that the US existed gave liberal democracies their \\"edge\\" in the battle against totalitarian regimes. This was achieved mainly by the US's contributions to the European Allies' war efforts from a distant location that was geographically large and politically united.  American exceptionalism  This is a view of modern history that fits within the political theory of American exceptionalism. American exceptionalism, as defined by Jentleson, is a theory that holds that the United States possesses an inherent uniqueness and \\"special virtue\\" that is rooted in American principles and can be traced throughout American history. The idea that the United States is exceptional, or extraordinary, simply because it is the United States is a political philosophy that has been in existence for several decades and is a leading contributor to contemporary American political culture. (See Politics of the United States.)  Competing views  There are many other ideas as to the behaviors of states and how they react and interact in the world. Such views that provide alternate theories to American exceptionalism and the United States factor include realism, constructivism, and idealism, just to name a few. These are some of the popular theories used in today's discussions about international relations. They put emphasis on states' behaviors and how to forecast potential outcomes of the entire spectrum of international affairs, from militarized conflict to diplomacy.

The two men wished to honor their benefactor, Jean Bellande Joseph, who died on September 15, 2007. Joseph Jean Bellande Joseph was born on October 23, 1944. He married and had seven children while working professionally as a tailor. He lived his life with the profound sense that he should share his successes with the disadvantaged. To that end, he supported several generations of rural children in their educations. Rural issues Families and households in the rural region of Cayes-Jacmel, Haiti face countless difficulties. The parents of disadvantaged children often practice subsistence agriculture on leased land. The deforestation of rural Haiti makes it increasingly difficult to make ends meet by farming, and parents are frequently unable to provide basic needs for their children, like adequate food, medicine and education. Of primary concern to us are the great numbers of rural children who are not able to go to school. These children are at risk of delinquency, but they are often undernourished and go without basic supports. Although several initiatives have been undertaken, the predicament of destitute rural children is too often ignored. This situation compelled us to found and operate an institution able to help the children that live in these onerous conditions. Mission Their mission is a social one, and their motto ‚ÄúS‚Äôunir pour sauver les enfants d√©favoris√©s‚Äù translates, ‚ÄúUnited to save disadvantaged children.‚Äù Jean Bellande Joseph Foundation is blind to the religion or sex of children. They are a social organization offering a non- profit service to society. Objectives Their objectives are to: improve the quality of life of disadvantaged children and provide them with adequate supports such as food and medicines, support and strengthen the education of the child, so that she becomes a good citizen, capable of helping her country, empower rural children by helping them integrate socially in the broader society, combat juvenile delinquency, defend the rights of children, support and encourage the development of children at the social, economic, cultural, and artistic levels, achieve the elimination of all forms of discrimination against rural children. The Foundation has many donors who sponsor a few children who cannot go to school or have a square meal every day. They seek to provide a hot meal seven days a week for the children that frequent the foundation. They seek to provide a vitamin program for the children to ensure that they are receiving the proper nutrients. They seek to immunize these children and ensure that there is a medical safety net for them in the instance of their sickness. They seek to support the educations of these children, paying their school fees and providing them with scholarly materials such as books, backpacks and other school supplies, and the appropriate clothes and shoes for school. They seek to support the social integration of rural children by providing a place for them to come and socialize, learn and engage with their peers, while contributing to their local community through service projects. History They began their organization with the aforementioned goals and initiatives. Because of the economic difficulties of the recent past and the devastating earthquake of January 12, 2010, that destroyed everything that they had, it was necessary for them to start anew. They have been struggling, ever since the earthquake to raise balance sheets to the level needed to sustain their work. This situation leaves them tremendously vulnerable. Their primary initiatives highlight the support and provision of education, nutrition and health for 35+ children in the rural areas of Cayes-Jacmel. The calculations for their budget are based on anticipated expenses for each child during the year. Their annual budget is $22,100 USD. The food budget is for one meal per day for each child. This includes the food itself and the cost for preparing it. School starts in October and it is important to us that children are properly enrolled in schools at this time. The allowance for school includes scholarly materials and the appropriate clothes. The medical allowance provides for immunizations and emergency medications and doctor visits as well as a vitamin program. It is necessary that they provide support to the staff that work with the children each day. They have budgeted an allowance for the teacher and assistants at the foundation and for the facilities themselves.

The missionary Frederick Stanley Arnot relates that a copper trader named Kalasa became a close friend of the old chief of Sanga. At one point Kalasa's son Msidi (Msiri) visited the Sanga country instead of his father, where he found the people at war with the Baluba people, who were invading from the north. Msiri's party had four guns, unknown weapons in the area at that time, and a few shots from the guns put the Baluba to flight. The old chief was grateful, gave Msiri increasing power, end eventually made him his successor. Mziri founded the state of Geranganze with its capital at Bunkeya and took the title of king in 1870. Shortly after this the Sanga people revolted against Msiri's rule, led by their chief Mpande. In the 1890s the Sanga put up a strong resistance to the colonial Force Publique of King Leopold II of Belgium. In one notorious incident, rebels led by a chief called Mulume Niama killed a Belgian officer. The rebels were pursued by Congo Free State troops and trapped in a large chalk cave. When they refused to surrender, despite attempts to smoke them out, the cave was blocked up. Three months later, troops entered the cave and found 178 bodies. The soldiers triggered landslides to cover the cave and destroy all evidence of what could come to be seen as a martyrdom. In the 1950s many of the Sanga people obtained work in the mines of the Katanga copperbelt. Mwenda Jean Bosco was the leading guitarist in Congo in the 1950s. His other name is Mwenda wa Bayeke, based on a claim of descent from the Sanga noble clan of Bayeke. His music draws on various sources including the traditional music of his Luba/Sanga people. In 1991 the estimated population of Sanga people was about 431,000, scattered through the Lubudi, Mitwaba, and Pweto territories. The Tumbwe people, a small group of about 100,000 people whose homeland is in the Kalemie Territory on the west shore of Lake Tanganyika, take their name from a hereditary chief of the Sanga people.

Bildts [bilts] is a Dutch-West Frisian hybrid language spoken in the largest part of the former municipality Het Bildt (ca. 1505‚Äì2017) in the Dutch province of Friesland. The dialect evolved from the early sixteenth century onwards, from around 1505, when the area was reclaimed from the sea as ordered by George, Duke of Saxony. In order to achieve this task, workers from Holland, Zeeland, and Brabant moved to Friesland, and their Low-Franconian dialects mixed with West Frisian. There has been debate on whether the former changed the latter or the other way around, but the dialect has also been called a creole language. Bildts is spoken in the towns of Sint Annaparochie (Bildts: Sint-Anne), Sint Jacobiparochie (Sint-Jabik), Vrouwenparochie (Froubuurt), Oudebildtzijl (Ouwe-Syl), Westhoek (De Westhoek) and Nij Altoenae.

Career Military Bayle began his military career in 1932 when he entered the √âcole Navale. After promotion he sailed on various ships and conducted campaigns to China and Africa. After attending further marine school training in Lorient, Bayle completed two missions, one in 1948 the other in 1949, to Ad√©lie Land on the Commandant Charcot for which he became the on-board photographer, historian, and official painter. He commanded the French Navy in Polynesia from 1956 to 1958. In 1975 he was elected to the Acad√©mie de Marine. Museum and historical work In 1954 Bayle created a large model aircraft carrier on the Seine in order to demonstrate the complexity of the equipment and electronics involved. He was the director of the Mus√©e national de la Marine in Paris from 1972 to 1980 and created the concept of a \\"port-museum\\", especially in Port- Louis, near Lorient. He was particularly interested in historic ships such as the Gro√üherzogin Elisabeth, a three-masted war-damaged ship which was brought back to Brest in 1946 and renamed the Duchesse Anne. After serving in the Navy the ship sank into neglect. After an initial restoration project funded by the Port-Louis museum, Bayle launched a new call for the rescue of the Duchess Anne in February 1979, deeming her condition to be critical. It was ultimately Dunkirk that restored the ship in 1980/81, where it remains on display. Bayle founded the French maritime heritage preservation association \\"AMERAMI\\" in 1975. Artistry Bayle drew and painted, mostly in watercolors, beginning with his first expedition to China where he developed his talent in this discipline. Other locations included in this collection are Tahiti, Moorea, Bora Bora and Mangareva, as well as the less frequented √éle Saint-Paul, Macquarie Island, Kerguelen Islands, and the Balleny Islands. His works are complemented by rag sewn tapestries, posters, and advertisements. He also illustrated many books. Bayle was appointed Peintre de la Marine in 1944. After the war ended he received an order for a tapestry for the officers of the Rue Royale. Due to his lack of funds, the Naval police provided him with a bundle of material and a team of seamstresses to perform the work. In the 1948 mission to Ad√©lie Land, Commander Max Jacques Henri Douguet accepted Bayle on board with the prevision that he learn how to use a film camera. During the three months of travel Bayle not only learned how to film, he also composed a tapestry commemorating the arrival of Jules Dumont d'Urville to the territory in 1840. In addition to writing a diary covering the first two Ad√©lie Land expeditions, Bayle wrote Le Voyage de la Nouvelle Incomprise recounting the same events. From 1960 to 1972, with Herv√© Baille Bayle, he created a publishing company (B & B). After designing the logo for the legendary ship Calypso, he conceived and designed the crystal sword used for Jacques Cousteau's official Acad√©mie fran√ßaise reception in 1989. Legacy On 1 January 2003, the Universal Postal Union issued a stamp in his honour.

The plant also occurs in a small area of south-western Ontario from Lake Huron. Buchnera americana is mostly found along the edges of wet depressions, in limestone glades, prairies, moist sandy soils, and open woods. It sometimes forms a hemiparasitic relationship with a tree (any of several species), by attaching itself to the root system. Conservation In Canada, Buchnera americana is only found in \\"a stretch of the shoreline of Lake Huron in South-western Ontario\\". Only six populations exist, and they are considered Endangered provincially and nationally. In the United States, bluehearts are found in 11 states, from Ohio and Indiana to Georgia and Missouri. They are state ranked from S1 to S5 according to their degree of occurrence: S1 is extremely rare and S5 is secure. In Georgia and Virginia bluehearts are listed as S1; they are listed as S2 in Ohio and Texas; they are listed as S3 in Illinois, Kansas, Tennessee and parts of Kentucky; they are listed as S4 in Arkansas, Missouri and parts of Kentucky. In Ontario their natural interdunal habitats are threatened by development for housing, cottages and recreational areas, such as parks where the flowers are stepped on or picked. In the United States, bluehearts live in prairie habitats where fire is a necessary disturbance for seed germination and growth of other plants, but detrimental to bluehearts. Since burning occurs in a rotational 3‚Äì4 year cycle in Indiana, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, Bluehearts are greatly affected by habitat loss in these areas of the United States. Ecological importance Bluehearts are hemiparasitic, meaning they are able to grow independently without a host but grow more strongly with a host. They attach to their host plant by parasitic roots called haustoria. During stressful conditions (such as drought), bluehearts may heighten their parasitic effects to the point where a large group of them may damage small trees. Common host trees of bluehearts are white oak (Quercus alba), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and cottonwood (Populus deltoides). Caterpillars of the common buckeye (Junonia coenia) feed on the blueheart. Uses Buchnera americana has no known medicinal uses. In the garden, this plant is highly attractive to bees, butterflies, and birds.

The Presbyterian Historical Society is governed by a Board of Directors, which sets strategic directions for the Society, provides oversight, ensures financial stability and advocates and promotes the work of the Society within the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).  History  The Presbyterian Historical Society was organized on May 20, 1852, at the General Assembly meeting of the (Old School) Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. in Charleston, South Carolina. Concerned over the permanent loss of historical records, Old School Board of Education Secretary Cortland Van Rensselaer helped to orchestrate the Society‚Äôs creation.Smylie, James H. 1985. American Presbyterians: A Pictoral History. Philadelphia: Presbyterian Historical Society. The Society‚Äôs original mission was to ‚Äúcollect and preserve materials, and to promote the knowledge of the history of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.‚Äù Photograph of Cortlandt Van Rensselaer The first president of the Society was Van Rensselaer. The Society was located in Philadelphia, which is where the first presbytery in America was formed in 1706. Local businessman Samuel Agnew served as the Society's first librarian and treasurer. From the start, the Society took an ecumenical approach to collecting, inviting all branches of the Presbyterian and Reformed traditions to participate. At its 1853 General Assembly meeting, the Old School denomination approved transfer of the historical documents in its possession to the newly formed Presbyterian Historical Society.Rainey, Virginia. Stewards of our Heritage: A History of the Presbyterian Historical Society. Louisville, Ky: Geneva Press, 2002. The Society's first location was 821 Chestnut Street at the denomination's Board of Publication building. By 1864, the Society's collections had grown to 3,000 volumes, 8,000 pamphlets and 300 portraits. In 1870, the library moved up the street to the corner of Eleventh and Chestnut Streets. It now had 20,000 pamphlets and 500 portraits in its collection. In addition, the society received 600 church histories in 1876 as part of the denomination's wider efforts to celebrate the centennial.Presbyterian Historical Society, \\"The Centennial and the Society: A Church Discovers Its History.\\" Accessed July 11, 2018. https://www.history.pcusa.org/blog/2017/06/centennial-and-society- church-discovers-its-history. In 1879, the society moved again, this time to Race Street.\\"The Presbyterian Historical Society: One Hundred Forty Years.\\" American Presbyterians: Journal of Presbyterian History. 70. no. 1 (1992): 3-10. Mr. Agnew, the society's first librarian and an avid collector of Presbyterian documents, died before he could see the new building. In 1890, William C. Cattell, formerly of Lafayette College, was named the new president of the Society. The Society moved from Race Street to the Witherspoon Building in April 1897. The Witherspoon Building, at Walnut and Juniper Streets, was built by the Board of Publication for its own needs as well as a space for a ‚ÄúNew Presbyterian House.‚Äù The Society now had a library space, storage area, librarian's office and a conference room. It was also during Cattell's tenure in 1893 that the Society hired its first support staff person, a female clerk to assist in cataloging the holdings. Cattell was replaced in 1898 by Dr. Henry McCook. McCook was a Presbyterian Pastor, a noted entomologist, a writer of historical novels, a scholar of architecture and heraldry, and a member of the ‚ÄúFighting McCooks of Ohio‚Äù who served the Union during the Civil War. In 1901, McCook helped to establish a publication for the Society called The Presbyterian Journal. It was later renamed The Journal of the Presbyterian Historical Society and it is the oldest denominational, historical publication in the country. By 1911, the collection size had grown to 20,000 volumes and 50,000 pamphlets. The Society at that time was maintained by annual dues from its members. Despite a constant push for new membership, this did not prove a sustainable form of finance for the Society. Dr. Henry C. McCook in his study (1890) In 1925, thanks to the support of the PCUSA Stated Clerk Lewis S. Mudge, the Society was designated the Department of History of the Office of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. After years of poor financing, this move ensured a steady stream of income for the society to continue its work of collection and preservation. It was also through Mudge's involvement that the Historical Society began to use its archives to answer reference questions for the larger denomination and promote itself to the academic community. During the 1950s, the Society began a publication program to share its collections with the academic world. The first Society publication was Presbyterian Enterprise: Sources of American Presbyterian History edited by Maurice Armstrong, Lefferts A. Loetscher and Charles A. Anderson. Since then, the Society has published other books including American Presbyterians: A Pictorial History by James H. Smylie and All Black Governing Bodies: The History and Contributions of All-Black Governing Bodies in the Predecessor Denominations of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Sculpture of John Witherspoon by Alexander Stirling Calder In 1960, William B. Miller became the manager for the Society. Under his leadership, the minutes of the General Assembly were microfilmed and made available for sale. With the help and assistance of Stated Clerk Eugene Carson Blake, Alexander Mackie and the Friends of Old Pine Street Church, a new building for the Historical Society was planned. The society moved to this building, its current home, in 1967. In front of the building are large stone statues designed by Alexander Stirling Calder that were originally part of the fa√ßade of the Witherspoon Building. They represent prominent figures in American Presbyterianism: John Witherspoon, James Caldwell, Samuel Davies, Francis Makemie, John McMillan and Marcus Whitman. In 1983, the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. and the Presbyterian Church in the U.S. combined to form the current Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). The Presbyterian Historical Society and the PCUS Historical Foundation in Montreat, North Carolina, merged in 1988. In 2006, the Montreat office closed and many of the collections stored in Montreat moved to Philadelphia, while others were transferred to Columbia Theological Seminary and other archival institutions. Some of the noteworthy collections the Presbyterian Historical Society possesses include the personal library and correspondence of Sheldon Jackson, a pioneering missionary in Alaska and the West during the late nineteenth century. The society also owns the personal library of Rev. John D. Shane which includes invaluable information about pioneer life in Kentucky and the Mississippi Valley before the Civil War. Another noteworthy collection is the American Indian Correspondence: the Presbyterian Historical Society Collection of Missionaries Letters, 1833‚Äì1893, which includes correspondence from Presbyterian missionaries who served Native Americans. The Society also holds a manuscript of the sermon delivered by Phineas Densmore Gurley in the East Room of the White House during Abraham Lincoln's Funeral. Recent collections of note at the Society include records of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. The NCC is an ecumenical organization made up of 29 Protestant, Anglican and Orthodox denominations. In 1989, Miller retired and was succeeded by Dr. Frederick J. Heuser, Jr. Dr. Heuser retired as director in 2013, to be succeeded by the Rev. Dr. Beth Hessel. The Historical Society has an annual intake of 500 cubic feet of archival material each year. 2010 Annual Report of the Presbyterian Historical Society. Philadelphia: Presbyterian Historical Society, 2010. The Society also answered over 3,600 reference inquiries on holdings and services in 2015.  Current services  The Presbyterian Historical Society is a department of the Office of the General Assembly of the PC(USA) and fulfills the recordkeeping responsibilities of all General Assembly entities. It achieves this goal by housing and servicing valuable records of the denomination. The Society also provides step-by-step records management programs for all levels of the denomination, including synods, presbyteries and congregations. The Historical Society also provides information on how to protect vital records from disaster and improve filing systems through its records management program. The program provides retention schedules and advice on managing and preserving electronic records. The Society can provide a step by step guide to forming a records management program for various levels of the denomination. The Historical Society also publishes The Journal of Presbyterian History twice a year with articles that document and explore the Presbyterian experience. Many of the articles and book reviews are written by scholars. The Historical Society staff writes the ‚ÄúOur Documentary Heritage‚Äù section of the Journal, which illustrates an aspect of Presbyterian history through artifacts and photographs. The staff also produces ‚ÄúOn Holy Ground‚Äù, which highlights churches, cemeteries or other locations that were awarded a place on the American Presbyterian/Reformed Historic Sites Registry. The Society's website contains information about some of its holdings through the online catalog, CALVIN, which includes records for over 75,000 books, periodicals, and other archival materials. The website also includes online guides that describe contents of processed archival collections. The society's website also has a searchable database for its Foreign Missionary Personnel Files, Congregation Vertical Files and Biographical Vertical Files. Also available on the website is Hall's Index of American Presbyterian Congregations, which is a compilation and summary of information on Presbyterian congregations pulled from various sources. The index contains the organization and dissolution dates of churches as well as denomination and location changes, mergers, and other actions. The Historical Society also supports an extensive digital reformatting program. In 2014, the historical society ended its 60-year-microfilming program to target its resources towards digital preservation. Presbyterian Historical Society, \\"PHS Goes Digital.\\" Accessed July 15, 2016. http://www.history.pcusa.org/blog/2014/04/phs-goes- digital. In 2015, the historical society's digital preservation lab took 158,000 scans; which includes 88,842 scans of images and paper records and over 68,000 frames of microfilm. In order to help preserve important denominational records, a discounted rate is available to all PC(USA) entities for digitization. In addition, annual Heritage Preservation Grants that cover up to $500 towards the cost of digital reformatting are available for congregations that are at least 50 years old and have fewer than 250 members. In 2015, the historical society launched its digital repository, Pearl, in honor of Pearl S. Buck, who was the child of Presbyterian missionaries. Research Fellowship Grants for scholars, students and independent researchers who need to use the Society's holdings for research are also available. Applicants must demonstrate a need to work in the society's collection for a minimum of one week and a maximum of one month. Applications are accepted from persons whose normal place of residence is farther than a seventy-five mile radius from Philadelphia. Exhibits are on display in the front lobby that contain materials from the Society's holdings. The Society's website also hosts several online exhibits. An additional exhibit option is traveling displays that may be used at any level of the denomination for special events.

It is native to northern North America, where it occurs throughout the southern half of Canada and the western and central United States. There are two subspecies; Carex inops subsp. inops is limited to the west coast from British Columbia to California, while Carex inops subsp. heliophila (sun sedge), is more widespread and is more common east of the Rocky Mountains.Fryer, Janet L. 2009. Carex inops. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. Description This sedge produces a loose clump of stems up to 50 centimeters tall. The stiff, narrow leaves persist, with dead ones remaining around the base of the plant. The inflorescence usually has pistillate spikes below staminate spikes.Carex inops. Flora of North America. The plant grows from rhizomes and fibrous roots; despite its common name, it does not usually form stolons. Ecology This plant, particularly sun sedge (C. inops subsp. heliophila), is a dominant species in a number of ecosystems, such as many grasslands. On the prairies of the northern Great Plains it is codominant with grasses such as western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii) and other wheatgrasses, big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi) and other bluestems, needle-and-thread grass (Hesperostipa comata) and other needlegrasses, and/or blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) and other gramas. It is common on the tallgrass prairies of Kansas alongside bluestems and prairie sandreed (Calamovilfa longifolia). It can be a dominant species in Rocky Mountain meadows, woodlands in Nebraska, the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming, and the plains of Saskatchewan. It can be found in each stage of ecological succession on grasslands. It can colonize blowouts, anthills, and prairie dog towns. Many types of animals consume this plant, particularly C. inops subsp. heliophila. It is considered a good forage for livestock because it is one of the first green plants to appear in the spring and animals such as cattle find it palatable.

Background For centuries classical ballet has been seen as an elitist art form and has rarely been identified as a form of dance ordinarily performed by African Americans or other minorities. In 1984, Frederic Franklin restaged the traditional European Giselle for the Dance Theatre of Harlem. To many, this restaging was seen as inappropriate and inferior to those based on the 1841 original choreographers, Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot.Gaiser, ‚ÄúCaught Dancing: Hybridity, Stability, and Subversion in Dance Theatre if Harlem‚Äôs Creole ‚ÄúGiselle,‚Äù 269. To others, Creole Giselle was a ground-breaking achievement. Dance Theatre of Harlem and Arthur Mitchell The Dance Theatre of Harlem was founded by Arthur Mitchell and Karel Shook in 1969, shortly after the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Arthur Mitchell was the first African-American soloist for the New York City Ballet. In 1955, he was chosen by George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein to join the company. Mitchell‚Äôs career boomed during the pre-civil rights era and set the precedent for African Americans in concert dance, specifically classical ballet. Mitchell and Shook were influenced by the ‚Äúoptimism and idealism of the Civil Rights Era‚Äù when they founded the school in the community where Mitchell spent his adolescent years, Harlem, New York.Schulman, ‚ÄúDance Diary: The Boundless Dance Theatre of Harlem,‚Äù 11. Mitchell‚Äôs plan was to give underprivileged children the same opportunities that he had as a teenager. The mission statement of the company is to ‚Äúpresent a ballet company of African-American and other racially diverse artists who perform the most demanding repertory at the highest level of quality.‚ÄùDance Theatre of Harlem: Mission Statement. This statement stays true to what Mitchell has done throughout the years, either through touring the company or community outreach. Frederic Franklin Frederic Franklin was born in Liverpool, England, in 1914 and at the age of six his mother took him to his first dance class.Dorris, ‚ÄúBook Review: The Fascinating Life of Frederic Franklin,‚Äù 270. From an early age, Franklin was noticed for his innate capacity for remembering dance steps. When Franklin moved to Paris, he dabbled in cabaret and then moved to London to continue performing in numerous cabarets and vaudeville with the Vic-Wells Ballet, now known as the Royal Ballet. In 1935, Franklin joined the Markova-Dolin Ballet, and it was through his dancing with this company that he was seen and asked by L√©onide Massine to join the new Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo. Franklin signed a four-year contract with the company, which proved to be the most significant opportunity in his career. In 1952, he founded the Slavenska/Franklin Ballet with Mia Slavenska.Sims, ‚ÄúThe Classic,‚Äù 55. After touring Japan and the Philippines, the company folded due to management and financial problems. He returned to the Ballet Russe shortly afterwards and restaged the repertory that had been lost when Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo folded. Through his work with The George Balanchine Foundation, he became the artistic advisor of the Dance Theatre of Harlem. Traditional staging of Giselle The award-winning ballet Giselle was set in the Rhineland of the Middle Ages during the grape harvest. Giselle, a peasant girl, falls in love with her neighbor Loys, the man whom Count Albrecht disguises himself as. A forester, Hilarion, loves Giselle, but she pays him no mind. During Giselle‚Äôs celebration of the end of the grape harvest, Hilarion discovers Loy‚Äôs real identity. The Duke of Courland and his daughter, Bathilde, Albrecht‚Äôs future wife, arrive and are welcomed by the peasants. Hilarion tells Giselle the truth about Loys, just as she is being crowned Queen of the Village. In shock, Giselle tries to kill herself with Albrecht‚Äôs sword, but dies from a weak heart. The Wilis are the ghosts of young girls who die before their wedding day, and who avenge themselves by making men who come to their graveyard dance themselves to death. One night, Hilarion visits Giselle‚Äôs grave and the Wilis kill him. Albrecht brings lilies to Giselle‚Äôs grave and she appears to him. As the Wilis attempt to kill Albrecht, Giselle asks Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis, to save him. Albrecht is spared, but Giselle must return to her grave. Reconstruction of Giselle The adaptation by the Dance Theatre of Harlem (DTH) of this traditional version of Giselle is very similar to the original, except for a few changes in the storyline and variations in the choreography. The narrative, the choreography, and the music by French composer Adolphe Charles Adam are kept the same as the original Giselle. The ballet is also set in Louisiana during the 1840s, and consists of an all-African American cast. The dancers wear costumes similar to the daily dress of African Americans in the 1840s. During this time social status among freed blacks was measured by how far removed one‚Äôs family was from slavery. Giselle‚Äôs character is kept the same; her greatest joy is to dance. Albrecht is now Albert and the Wilis are the ghosts of young girls who adore dancing and die of a broken heart. References Notes Sources * Adam, Rudolf. Nureyev in Giselle.

Spear joined the Royal Navy during the American War of Independence and soon saw action at several of the largest fleet actions of the war. He was with Rodney's fleet at the relief of Gibraltar, fighting at the capture of the Caracas convoy, the Battle of Cape St. Vincent and then at the capture of a French warship and her convoy. His ship was again in action with a Dutch ship in the Channel, before Spear went out to the West Indies and saw action at the Battle of the Saintes. It was the start of an enduring connection with the Caribbean, where Spear spent the most active part of his career. Continuing in active service during the years of peace, Spear rose to lieutenant and served on a number of ships during the French Revolutionary Wars. He was promoted to commander late in the wars, and was assigned to the West Indies on the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars. He commanded several sloops and unrated vessels with distinction, alternating with active service in command of larger ships of the line and frigates during the West Indies Campaign. He fought a particularly fierce action with a superior French force, for which he received plaudits from his commanding officer, and supported the Invasion of Martinique. His reward was to carry despatches to Britain, for which he was promoted to post-captain. Service with the Mediterranean Fleet followed, commanding ships of the line and blockading the French in Toulon. Ill health brought an end to his active service, and he returned to Britain in 1812. He did not live long enough to receive a promotion to flag rank and died in 1837, still a post-captain.  Early life  Spear was born in Weymouth, Dorset and entered the Royal Navy in 1779, joining the 74-gun as a midshipman. The Marlborough was commanded at this time by Captain Taylor Penny, also from Weymouth, and a previous acquaintance was probably responsible for Spear obtaining a position on the ship. Marlborough was one of the ships assigned to the fleet under Sir George Brydges Rodney and sent to relieve Gibraltar in early 1780. Spear's ship was in action several times within a few months, firstly at the interception and capture of a convoy of Spanish ships of the Caracas Company on 8 January, and then at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent on 16 January. Marlborough was then detached with a small squadron under Admiral Robert Digby and ordered to escort a convoy to Menorca. While returning to Britain from Gibraltar, Digby's squadron came across the French 64-gun Prot√©e, escorting a fleet of transports bound for Mauritius. The Prot√©e and three transports were duly captured. The Battle of the Saintes, 12 April 1782: surrender of the Ville de Paris by Thomas Whitcombe, painted 1783, shows Hood's , centre, attacking the French flagship Ville de Paris, right. Spear then served in the Western Approaches for the rest of 1780, where Marlborough was again in action at the end of the year, capturing the Dutch 64-gun Prinses Carolina on 30 December 1780. 1781 was spent with the Western squadron, and in January 1782 Spear sailed with his ship for the West Indies with Rodney's fleet. Marlborough was in action at the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782, sustaining casualties of three killed and sixteen wounded. Following the British victory at the Saintes, Marlborough sailed to North America with Admiral Hugh Pigot in July, and spent between September and October at New York. She was then active in the blockade of Cap-Fran√ßois for the remainder of the war. Following the signing and ratification of the Treaty of Paris, the war came to an end and Marlborough sailed back to Britain to be paid off. Spear left the ship and managed to find further employment in the navy. Spear served first aboard the sloop , later transferring to the 64-gun and then to the 74-gun . It was while serving on Bellona that Spear received his promotion to lieutenant, on 15 October 1790. He went on to serve on the East Indies station as first-lieutenant of the sloop .  French Revolutionary Wars  Spear returned to Britain after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, and received postings to a number of ships. He was first aboard the 74-gun , but later transferred to the 28-gun . His later ships were the 74-gun and the 50-gun . Spear was serving aboard the latter vessel when she was used to carry Caroline of Brunswick from Cuxhaven to Greenwich in March 1795 for her marriage to the Prince of Wales. He then served aboard the 64-gun , the flagship of Vice-Admiral George Vandeput at Halifax. Vandeput promoted Spear to his first command, making him master and commander of the sloop HMS Lily in March 1799. He remained in command of Lily until 1802, when he transferred to , a former 44-gun frigate, now armed en fl√ªte, and sailed her back to Britain in February 1803. Britain had been temporarily at peace with France after the signing of the Treaty of Amiens, but with the outbreak of war in March 1803, Spear was ordered back to the West Indies, transporting the second battalion of the Royal Scots from Portsmouth to Barbados in June 1803. He landed the troops successfully in Carlisle Bay, and happened to notice a brig passing by flying Dutch colours. Anticipating that war with the Batavian Republic was imminent, Spear sent his boats out and detained the Dutch ship. Two days later Commodore Samuel Hood arrived with despatches announcing that all Dutch ships were to be seized. Hood thanked Spear for his timely action, and the brig, Vrow Elizabeth, and her cargo of coffee and cotton, were sold for ¬£20,000 in prize money.  Napoleonic Wars  With the resumption of the wars, Spear took an active part in the campaign against French and Dutch possessions in the West Indies. He supported the reductions of Saint Lucia, Tobago, Demerara, Essequibo and Berbice, and afterwards escorted a convoy from Tortola to Britain. After refitting Chichester, Spear returned to the Leeward Islands to serve under the station commander, Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane. Cochrane appointed him to several temporary acting commands, at first to the 36-gun . While commanding the Ethalion he recaptured the British ship Eliza, which had been captured while carrying provisions from Cork to Antigua. Spear was appointed to command the experimental sloop in January 1806. Spear's command of Dart was briefly interrupted by a further acting commission, this time as captain of Cochrane's flagship, the 74-gun . Spear took part in the pursuit of a French squadron in June 1806 which had recently arrived in the Caribbean under Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez, and was again moved from his ship, this time to become acting captain of the 74-gun . Returning to command Dart during the second half of 1806, Spear captured the 8-gun schooner privateer Jeune Gabriella on 9 November 1806, and also recaptured a brig bound from Halifax to Trinidad with a cargo of fish. Dart was sailing in company with the sloop during these events. Spear was transferred to take command of the sloop in 1807, and continued to operate with success against privateers, capturing the 5-gun Nouvelle Entreprise on 27 December 1807. He also captured the Spanish packet ship Firmeza during his time with Nimrod.  Goree vs Pylade and Palinure  In early 1808 Spear was transferred to take command of the sloop HMS Goree, aboard which he continued in the West Indies. While lying at anchor off Marie-Galante on 22 April 1808, two brigs were spotted sailing northwards. Spear determined that they were enemies after they made no response to his private signal, and set off in pursuit. The two brigs, mounting 16 guns each and so constituting the superior force, hauled up and fired on Goree, badly damaging her sails and rigging, and disabling her. They were then forced to flee when another British ship, the 14-gun arrived on the scene. Goree had one man killed and four wounded in the brief engagement, while the two brigs had combined losses of eight killed and twenty-one wounded. The brigs were later discovered to be the French Pylade and Palinure. The Palinure was later captured, causing Sir Alexander Cochrane to write in his report \\"the last of the two [Palinure] which were so gallantly beaten by His Majesty's sloop Goree.\\" On his return to Marie-Galante Spear came ashore to be received by the entire garrison drawn up presenting arms, drums playing a march and fifes playing Rule, Britannia!. Cochrane wrote a personal letter to Spear saying \\"I am sorry that the spirit and gallantry displayed by yourself, officers, and crew, did not meet with the success which you all so evidently deserved\\". Though the action was unsuccessful and therefore not gazetted, the Admiralty acknowledged Spear's deed by confirming the appointment of his acting second-lieutenant Thomas Clack. Spear was then to have transferred from Goree to the sloop , pursuant to orders brought out by Commander George Alfred Crofton. Crofton was to supersede Spear in command of Goree, but Crofton observed that \\"as a battle often caused officers and men to become more strongly attached to each other, Captain Spear would probably wish to continue in the Goree; in which case he himself had no objection whatever to take the Fawn\\". Cochrane approved the gesture, writing out two commissions for Spear and Crofton, leaving the names of the ships blank to allow them to come to a mutual agreement. Spear chose to remain with Goree and Crofton instead took command of Fawn. Goree, with Spear still in command, made one more important capture in 1808, taking the 8-gun privateer General Villaret on 24 November. General Villaret was carrying a cargo of sugar, coffee and cotton at the time of her capture. Spear then assisted in the Invasion of Martinique in early 1809, and was given the honour of carrying Cochrane's despatches back to London, with Cochrane's instructions to the Lords of the Admiralty to apply to Spear for more information, describing him as \\"an old and deserving commander\\". He arrived on 12 April 1809 and was promptly promoted to post- captain the following day.  Captaincy  Spear received his first appointment as a post-captain in April 1810, when he was given command of the 100-gun . He commanded her in the Mediterranean Fleet under Admiral Sir Charles Cotton, maintaining the blockade of Toulon. In March 1811 he was appointed to command the 98-gun , the flagship of Rear-Admiral Francis Pickmore, and for the most part the blockade was uneventful. Though possessing a powerful fleet, the French commander avoided any contact with the blockading force and stayed in port, or else made very short voyages, returning to the harbour when the British appeared. The Mediterranean Fleet blockading Toulon, an 1830 painting by Thomas Luny Temeraires one brush with the French during this period came on 13 August 1811. Having received orders to sail to Menorca, Spear attempted to tack out of Hy√®res Bay. As he tried to do so, the wind fell away, leaving Temeraire becalmed and caught in a current which caused her to drift towards land. She came under fire from a shore battery on Pointe des Medes, which wounded several of her crew. The most serious casualty was her master, Robert Duncan, who had one of his legs shot off as he stood talking to Spear. Temeraires boats were quickly manned, and together with boats sent from the squadron, she was towed out of range of the French guns. She then sailed to Menorca and underwent repairs. During this period an epidemic of yellow fever broke out, infecting nearly the entire crew and killing around a hundred crewmen. Spear was one of those badly affected, and the commander in chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Sir Edward Pellew, ordered him back to Britain with his ship. Health gradually improved as she sailed through the Atlantic. Spear was to have commanded Temeraires replacement in the Mediterranean, the 100-gun , but his ill health prevented this.  Family and later life  Despite his eventful career, his low position on the seniority lists meant that Spear never lived to be promoted to flag rank. He died in 1837, still a post- captain. He had been twice married, marrying his first wife Grace Grant, a descendant of Charles Gordon, 2nd Earl of Aboyne, in 1809. After her death he married Grace Grant, a cousin of his first wife.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. It was a Commissioners' church, having received a grant towards its construction from the Church Building Commission. The building also housed radio station Rock FM from 1981-2020. https://www.lancs.live/news/lancashire-news/end-era-rock-fm- presenters-17637649 History St Paul's was built between 1823 and 1825, and was designed by Thomas Rickman and Henry Hutchinson. A grant of ¬£6,221 () was given towards its construction by the Church Building Commission. In 1882 a chancel was added to the church, and a baptistery was created within the church, by T. H. Myers. The church was declared redundant on 1 January 1979. In 1981 it was bought for ¬£35,000 by Red Rose Radio who spent ¬£780,000 to convert it into a radio station. The conversion was carried out by Sandy Brown Associates. Two radio stations, 97.4 Rock FM and Greatest Hits Lancashire, used to broadcast from the building until 2020. Architecture The former church is constructed in sandstone with a tiled roof. Its architectural style is Early English. The plan consists of a seven-bay nave with full-height aisles, a two-bay chancel and offices. It has a three-span roof. The west end is in three sections; the central section is gabled, and the side sections are smaller with angle buttresses. Octagonal turrets rise at the junctions of the sections. In the lower part of the central section is a three-bay arcade, each arch containing a window. Above the arcade are three stepped lancet windows, over which is a small circular window. The turrets are slim and contain open arcading, and an embattled cap over which is a tall pinnacle with a quatrefoil finial. Each side section contains a tall lancet window. Along the side of the church, the bays are divided by buttresses. The first bays contain a doorway with a window above it, and all the other bays have pairs of lancet windows. At the east end of the church are three stepped lancet windows and pinnacles similar to those at the west end. War Memorial The parish war memorial stands in the northern corner of the former church's grounds having been relocated there from its original location nearby due to vandalism. It takes the form of a slim hexagonal column of sandstone, similar to the church, on a small stepped base surmounted by six grouped columns with a Celtic-style cross on the top. Originally it bore metal plates commemorating the men of the parish who lost their lives in World War One (and World War Two?) but these have been removed at some point and their location is unknown.

It is located about one kilometre south of Villenbach. The \\"Hausener M√ºhle\\", which is now a sawmill, also belongs to the village. Name origin The name \\"Hausen\\" originated from the expression Husen or Hvsen. If translated into literal German, it means zu den H√§usern (\\"to the houses\\"). Alternative spellings and associations of the name exist‚Äîin earlier times people referred to as Housen bey Vilibach or Husen an der Zussm. Population The population of Hausen is 145 (as of January 1, 2010) in about 60 dwellings.  History  Hausen was probably founded in the 9th century when the first people settled there. The first official mention is attributed to February 7, 1272. On that date, the abbot of Fultenbach, Otto von Gies, gave Ritter Albert von Villenbach a deed for the \\"Hausener M√ºhle\\" at the Zusam. This led to the settlement of Hausen. One important event in the history of Hausen was during the year 1637, in which over a short period of time, Hausen had no inhabitants, because all citizens of Hausen perished either in the Thirty Years' War or from the Plague or Hunger. Modern times Since 1818, Hausen has been an official part of Villenbach. Amongst its small number of local businesses there is a tyre service, a carpenter's workshop, a feed trade and a business for electrical installations. Controversy amongst the town people exists about the creation of a bypass, which divides local opinion.  Alpenrose Hausen  Marksmen's Inn, Hausen A weekly gathering takes place at the only clubhouse in Hausen, called Alpenrose Hausen, built mostly by the community between 1998 and 2002. It is a very important part of village life, as most of the citizens attend and meet there socially. Also weekly shooting practices take place and occasional competitions against other shooting clubs. Every year the club organises a Maypole festival, a summer festival, a Christmas celebration, a Carnival ball and a Schafkopf tournament.  Chapel  St. Nicholas' Chapel Altar of the chapel A chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas is located very centrally in Hausen. Every five weeks there is a service in the chapel. The first chapel was built in 1592 and demolished in the 19th century. The existing chapel was built in 1853. The citizens contributed financially and helped build the chapel.

The Free Syrian Army had been targeting Syrian Army military patrols in the governorate since October 2011. Protests had still continued in this governorate, but they were often dispersed with gunfire by security forces. On 19 December, it became clear that \\"Army defectors have taken control over some towns and villages, almost as though they have created some sort of safe area, where protesters from other regions were seeking a safe haven and where defectors were able to operate from\\", and Syrian Army forces launched an offensive on one area, massacring a large number of civilians in one village. Hundreds of troops have been filmed after switching sides in one village in the province's countryside, prompting residents to hoist a flag of independence.  Background  On 29 June, Syrian troops killed at least four civilians as army tanks and helicopters attacked a village in the northwestern province of Idlib, activists said, \\"The four died in random firing on the village of Rameh from tank machine guns, which has become customary in these unjustified assaults. The tanks started firing on surrounding woods then directed their fire on the village,\\" Ammar Qarabi, president of the Syrian National Human Rights Organisation, told Reuters news agency from exile in Cairo. On 2 July, Alarabiya reported of larger deployment of Syrian troops in the Idlib province, where some 16 civilians were killed on 1 July. Tanks were first reported to be moving toward Idlib city on 4 July, after massive anti- Government protests took place at the province.Syria unrest: 'Arrests in Hama as tanks move on Idlib ' Yet, nightly protests still continued despite the siege.  Armed clashes  September 2011 On 8 September, Security forces abducted the 74-year-old brother of army defector Lieutenant Colonel Hussein Harmoush, one of the first defecting officers. Muhammad Harmoush was abducted and his body was later returned to his family when the soldiers raided his home in the village of Ibleen. It was also reported that three military defectors were killed in the raid and SANA, Syrian state television, reported that six of their soldiers were killed in the operation. On 29 September, the Harmoush Battalion of the Free Syrian Army claimed responsibility for an attack on security forces in the Jabal Zawiya area, killing a number of security personnel. October 2011 Around 5 October, security forces raided villages close to the Turkish border, five villagers and seven soldiers were said to have died in clashes there. Suspected deserters killed eight soldiers in simultaneous attacks on three army posts in the northern province of Idlib on 10 October. One of the first reported engagements in the Province was on 18 October, when \\"Gunmen suspected of being army defectors blew up a bomb by remote control as an army vehicle passed by Ehssem in the countryside of the (northwestern province of Idlib), killing an officer and three soldiers, and wounding others,\\" said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (S.O.H.R.) On 25 October, army defectors who defected during a military assault in the central province of Homs gathered and launched an assault on a road block, where many armored vehicles were said to have parked. The battle took place on the edge of Maarat al-Numaan, up to ten security agents were killed with an unknown number of defector casualties. One of the earliest engagements in the province was on 30 October 2011, when a transporting security agents between the villages of al-Habit and Kafr Nabudah in Idlib province, close to the Turkish border was attacked \\"by armed men, probably deserters\\", the resulting battle leaving 10 security agents and one deserter dead. November 2011 Five soldiers were killed in ambushes near Maarat al-Numaan on 10 November. The Free Syrian Army (FSA), operated on 26 November 2011, when they killed eight regular Syrian Army soldiers and members of the security forces and wounded 40 more in an attack in Idlib in northwest Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said: > A group of deserters attacked a squad of soldiers and security agents in a > convoy of seven vehicles, including three all-terrain vehicles, on the road > from Ghadka to Maaret Numan. The Britain-based watchdog said: > Eight were killed and at least 40 more were wounded. The deserters were able > to withdraw without suffering any casualties. The Free Syrian Army said in a statement it was behind the attack. On 27 November, a person was killed in the Kafr Nabl area of Idlib province in the northwest after being arrested by security forces \\"for selling fuel to militants,\\" the Syrian observatory for human rights claimed. On 29 November, the FSA launched an attack that killed three government soldiers and captured two others, and then government forces later shot dead a civilian. At least six anti-government demonstrators were shot dead when security forces broke up an anti-government demonstration in the city of Idlib on 30 November. \\"They have not blocked protests in Idlib for weeks. Today they fired at a crowd thousands who were marching from a roundabout to the main Mohafaza Square,\\" said Fares, an activist. December 2011 On 1 December, FSA troops launched a raid on an intelligence building in Idlib, leading to a three-hour fire fight in which eight loyalists were killed.https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/02/us-syria-defectors- idUSTRE7B10UH20111202Reutersname=Syrian army deserters target Assad's military convoys date = 2 December 2011 On 3 December, seven members of the security forces, five army rebels and three civilians were killed in a three- hour night-time battle in Idlib, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. On 5 December, at least a dozen Syrian secret police defected from an intelligence compound, in what appeared to be the first major desertion from a service that acted as a pillar of President Assad's rule.

Ten people were killed or wounded on both sides, the activists said, according to Reuters. On 8 December, in Idlib, military forces raided houses and arrested three militants, in the vicinity of Saraqib, while some 50 armoured vehicles, including tanks and troop carriers, came under attack in the village of al- Rami.

According to Syrian state media, three rebels died planting a bomb and were buried in a park. This could not be verified. On 12 December two protesters and five soldiers were reported killed. On 13 December, violence flared in the province. Firstly, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that army defectors in Idlib's Bab al-Hawa road killed seven members of Syria's security forces in retaliation for an attack that cost the lives of 11 civilians. On the same day, five more civilians were shot dead by security forces while official Syrian state media SANA stated that \\"armed terrorists\\" ‚Äì its usual tn. On 19 December, the FSA suffered its largest loss of life when new defectors tried to abandon their positions and bases between the villages of Kansafra and Kafr Oweid in Idlib province. Activist groups, specifically the Syrian Observatory for Human rights, reported that 72 defectors were killed as they were gunned down during their attempted escape. The Syrian Army lost three soldiers during the clashes. The next day, S.O.H.R. stated that in all 100 defectors were killed or wounded. Also, the same day, the Syrian Observatory for human rights reported the killing by government security forces of at least 111 civilians in the province. It had been called a \\"massacre\\", 37 civilians had also been killed the previous day. Alaa El Din Al Youssef, a Syrian opposition member in Idlib, described the government's attack on the area of Idlib and Jabal al-Zawiya as a massacre. \\"Civilians were surrounded by security forces who killed 100 of us. The corpses of those killed were left in the streets and the mosques and we are not allowed to bury any of them.\\" \\"Some of those killed cannot be recognised. Some were burnt and some beheaded with their hands tied. We are really scared because the area might be stormed once again.\\" The clashes continued into the next day, and another report, by Lebanese human rights activist Wissam Tarif, put the death toll even higher with 163 defectors, 97 government troops and nine civilians killed on the second day alone as the military tracked down the soldiers and civilian that managed to initially escape. On 21 December, it was reported that the FSA had taken control over large swathes of Idlib province including some towns and villages.

Plot A van arrives at a gas station, where a nearby newspaper announces an \\"unidentified girl found dead in forest\\". The van belongs to a group of seven friends ‚Äì Michael, Lyla, TJ, Claire, Lex, Rose, and Guy ‚Äì who are traveling to a mutual friend's cabin in the woods for a vacation. Michael, who is driving, gets lost in the dark and swerves to avoid a waving figure in the road. The van crashes, which forces them to travel on foot. They arrive at a well-furnished cabin where Rose finds a written note telling \\"TJ, Lex, Claire\\" to wait there for them, so they assume that this is the house. The group enjoys themselves in the comfortable cabin, with the exception of Michael, who sleeps early and has nightmares. The next morning, TJ discovers an abandoned mine nearby and takes the group inside to explore. TJ and Guy, as a joke, briefly lock Michael inside an enclosed cell, which causes him to panic. Rose, who is a psychic, is uneasy about the mine and at one point feels someone grab her leg, though it cannot be one of her friends. Michael and his girlfriend Lyla return to the van to collect Michael's anti-psychotic medication and confirm that the van is unusable. They find blood on the van's fender and assume that they hit an animal the previous night. Upon returning to the house, the group collectively agrees to stay one more day to wait for the owners of the house. Over the day, Rose has fits and visions of her friends in various stages of death and injury. While exploring the mines again, TJ and Lex discover three dead bodies that appear identical to theirs and Guy's. They inform the others, and the group reluctantly agrees that something supernatural is occurring. TJ and Lex return to the mine in search of answers and find a traumatized Claire locked inside a cell; she claims that it is Michael's doing. TJ and Lex refuse to save her, knowing that \\"their\\" Claire is still in the house, a decision that Claire later supports. Despite Lyla's protests, the others debate whether Michael needs to be locked up overnight for their protection. Unnerved by his passive acceptance of his fate, they put him inside one of the mine's cells. Michael escapes from the cell, which leads to a chase inside the mines, during which Michael causes TJ's and Lex's deaths and locks Claire up inside a cell, where she meets the alternate version of herself. Inside the house, Rose succumbs to poisoning and dies. Guy and Lyla agree to flee, leaving behind in the house a written note for \\"TJ, Lex, Claire\\" to wait there for them. Upon reaching the main road, Guy tries to wave down an oncoming van, causing it to swerve and hit Lyla. Guy recognizes the occupants of the van as \\"them\\" from the night before and realizes that they are inside a causality loop. He promises the seriously injured Lyla that he will break the cycle. Guy rushes back to the house to warn the others but is stopped by Michael, who kills him. Michael continues the cycle by warning his past self that his friends will try to kill him, and that when they lock him inside a cell for the second time, he has to defend himself. Michael gives his past self the key to the cell and forces his past self to burn his anti-psychotic medication. The cycle restarts as the group's van arrives at the gas station at the beginning of the film. However this time Lyla from the previous cycle is still alive, and she hobbles towards her counterpart in the hopes of warning her and breaking the cycle. Cast *Joseph Cross as Michael *Briana Evigan as Lyla *Ethan Peck as Guy *Julianna Guill as Claire *Rafi Gavron as Lex *Alex Meraz as TJ *Rebecca Da Costa as Rose Production The original story was written by Ross McQueen and was set in Australia. Director Richard Gray, who was living in Australia at the time, worked with McQueen to adapt it to a setting in the US. Gray said that he was more influenced by Lord of the Flies than slasher films. In July 2011, Cross and Peck joined the cast, and the film was reported to begin shooting. The film was shot at Ape Cave in Gifford Pinchot National Forest and locations outside of Seattle, Washington. It went into post production in Los Angeles, California for an anticipated 2012 release. The film's crew consisted of a mixture of Australians and Americans, and the project was shot using the Red Epic camera. Release The film premiered in August 2012 at the Melbourne International Film Festival. Although originally set to be released in May 2014 in the US, it was renamed to The Evil Within, renamed back to Mine Games, and delayed until September 2014. The delay was in part due to re-shooting the ending. Reception Kwenton Bellette of Twitch Film wrote, \\"With such a great time travel horror thriller narrative that was advertised, Mine Games sadly comes off as nothing more than a poorly rehashed version of the masterful film Time Crimes or even Australian produced Triangle before it.\\" Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting rated it 1.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"Time loops have been done better before (masterful even, in the case of Time Crimes). Mine Games wastes the perpetually interesting concept and delivers flat thrills and flaccid characters.\\" Debi Moore of Dread Central rated it 3 out of 5 stars and wrote that the film starts off predictable but presents \\"a mind-bending series of twists and turns\\" that make it recommended.

Biography He was a pupil of Isaak Fisches, an historical painter, took Bourguignon, Lembke, and Tempesta for his models, but formed his style more especially through the study of the various phases of the military profession, from real life. He continued his studies for two years in Vienna, and in 1692 under Antonio Molinari in Venice, thence went to Rome. During the siege and pillage of Augsburg in 1703, he exposed himself to great danger by drawing, in the midst of the engagements, the scenes around him. The six etchings resulting from this are perhaps the most meritorious part of his work. His oil paintings may best be studied in the Brunswick Gallery, which contains nine battle pieces by him.

It was discussed in sessions of Congress for two years. On September 22, 1992, it was referred to the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. The bill was proposed as a time when the U.S. Congress had considerable interest in the NWS Modernization Program which would impact upon local weather offices. The bill was finally enacted on October 29, 1992 and signed by President George H. Bush. Background and general effect The Weather Service Modernization Act of 1992 came at a time when \\"a new framework was needed to implement research advances in in-situ technology, radar and satellite to real time, meso-scale observations of weather, water, and climate.\\" The bill was proposed to ensure to that Congress made it compulsory of the Secretary of Commerce to \\"certify that the modernization process will not degrade local weather services.\\" It effectively ensured that basic weathers services of surface, upper air and radar operations, public forecasts, statements and warnings, hydrologic, marine, fire, and weather forecasts and warnings, agricultural forecasts and advisories, climatological services, emergency management support and services wouldn't be affected by the plan of modernization at a local level. The Modernization Act effectively made it law that the network should provide complete coverage over the CONUS at a height of 3.05 km (10000 ft.) above ground level (AGL) without affecting the quality of service. The act required an increase in local staff and for many staff to relocate to areas where weather services were considered weak. Objectives The Weather Service Modernization Act of 1992 was put forward as part of the Department of Commerce's annual budget with a 10‚Äìyear National Implementation Plan under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act. The objectives of the proposal were as follows: *1. Contract with the National Research Council (NRC) for a review of the scientific and technical modernization criteria by which the Secretary proposes to certify action to close, consolidate, automate, or relocate NWS field offices. *2. Publish in the Federal Register final modernization criteria based on such NRC review. Changes requirements for certification that the closing, consolidation, automation, or relocation of any field office will not result in service degradation. To prohibit the Secretary of Commerce from: *1. Changing operations at an NWS field office pursuant to implementation of the Strategic Plan unless the Secretary has provided appropriate notification. *2. Removing or permanently decommissioning any NWS radar until the Secretary has prepared radar commissioning and decommissioning reports documenting that such action would be consistent with the final modernization criteria established above. *3. Commissioning an automated surface observing system located at an airport unless the weather services provided after commissioning will continue to be in full compliance with applicable flight aviation rules. *4 Closing, before January 1, 1996, any NWS field office pursuant to implementation of the Strategic Plan. *5. Losing or relocating any NWS field office located at an airport unless the Secretary determines that such action will not result in degradation of service that affects aircraft safety. *6. Losing or relocating any NWS field office which is the only office in a State unless the Secretary determines that a comparable level of weather services provided to in-State users will remain. *7. Losing, consolidating, automating, or relocating a NWS field office until arrangements have been made to maintain at least one person in the service area to act as a liaison officer with area weather service users with respect to the provision of information regarding NWS modernization and restructuring activities and weather warnings and forecasts.

Focusing on voter registration, lobbying politicians and mentoring schemes, OBV aims to inspire black and minority ethnic communities to engage with public institutions to address the perceived race inequalities in areas including education, health and employment.\\"Black voters urged to take part in election by church\\", BBC News ‚Äì Politics, 13 October 2012. Background Between 1994 and 1996 Black communities were subject to severe social and political pressure. The New York-based Human Rights Watch identified Britain as the country with the highest incidence of racial attacks in Europe. Research at Southampton University by law professor Lawrence Lustgarden showed that Britain jails more Black people per head of population than the USA.Kjartan P√°ll Sveinsson (ed.), \\"Ethnic Profiling: The Use of 'Race' in UK Law Enforcement\\", Runnymede Perspectives, May 2010. In early 1996, with the last date for a General Election 18 months away - Black volunteers at Charter88 and activists at The 1990 Trust began exploring ways of using the most important event in Britain's political calendar to raise the concerns of the Black community. OBV began by collating political and demographic data in marginal constituencies - and soon OBV realised that the Black vote was potentially immensely powerful. In over 50 seats the number of African, Asian and Caribbean voters was greater than its marginality. In another 50, Black numbers were such that OBV had the potential to play a significant role in any closely fought contest. A call to action would have a solid base and an immediate focus - the power of the Black vote at the coming General Election. The challenge was to persuade the Black community to recognise that power and inspire them to participate - and to serve notice on the political parties that they ignored the Black electorate at their peril. Operation Black Vote was launched in July 1996. In just ten months OBV held over 100 meetings at schools, colleges, community centres, local party offices and town halls up and down the country. OBV distributed over 250,000 voter registration cards; 500,000 leaflets in six different languages, and 50,000 posters. In comparison to any election before 1997, the positive attention the Black electorate received from the major parties was unprecedented. And the party leaders led from the front. In a speech that he would later make a point of sending to OBV, the then Prime Minister John Major said, \\"I don't pretend that the prospect for the young Black man in Brixton is yet as open as it is to the young white man in the Home Counties. It clearly isn't. But OBV must try and make it so.\\" Liberal Democrats leader Paddy Ashdown pledged to make the House of Commons more representatives, and described it as \\"a white, male, middle-class club.\\" And Tony Blair emphasised his lifetime commitment \\"to fight against racism.\\" At constituency level, MPs and candidates across the country took part in OBV Question Time meetings. For the first time in British political history, every candidate OBV invited came to listen to the Black electorate and argue their case. OBV's work Operation Black Vote‚Äôs work covers four main areas: * Political education: to raise awareness and understanding of democratic and civic society through citizenship projects. * Political participation: to improve general civic society engagement through local and national voter registration and other civic participation campaigns. * Political representation: to increase political representation of Black and minority ethnic communities, through encouraging engagement; undertaking ground-breaking mentoring schemes; lobbying political parties and civic institutions on the benefits of representative bodies. * Equality promotion and Political representation: to increase political representation of Black and ethnic minorities in Britain through empowering individuals to engage in both democratic and civic society, lobbying political parties to increase BME political representations and addressing issues of race equality.

EDC was privatized and acquired by the Lopez Group as part of its energy and power supply utility business units. History EDC used to be a subsidiary of Philippine National Oil Company. It was privatized and sold to First Philippine Holdings Corporation, a Lopez-owned and controlled corporation involved in energy and power supply generation business. In 2013, the company registered consolidated net income attributable to equity holders of the parent of P4.740 billion, lower by 47% than P9.002 billion in 2012. Consolidated revenues decreased by 10% year-on-year to P25.656 billion from P28.369 billion. The attributable net income in 2013 represented 18.5% of total revenue, compared to 31.7% in 2012. Recurring net income attributable to equity holders of the parent decreased by 23% to P6.565 billion from P8.522 billion.

Family Born about 1508, Edmund Knyvet was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Knyvet (c. 1485 ‚Äì 1512) and Muriel Howard (died 1512), the daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, by his first wife, Elizabeth Tilney. By her first marriage to John Grey, 2nd Viscount Lisle,. Muriel Howard had a daughter, Elizabeth Grey, Viscountess Lisle. Knyvet's father was slain in a naval battle near Brest on 10 August 1512, and four months later Knyvet's mother died in childbirth between 13 and 21 December 1512. According to Gunn, Knyvet and his two brothers and two sisters, Ferdinand, Henry (died c. 1546), Katherine and Anne, were at first entrusted to the care of their grandmother, Eleanor Knyvet.. In 1516 Knyvet's wardship was sold for ¬£400 to his father's friend, Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who had earlier been betrothed to Knyvet's half-sister, Elizabeth Grey. It appears that Suffolk resold the wardship to Sir Thomas Wyndham of Felbrigg, another friend and colleague of Knyvet's father. Wyndham died in 1522, and directed his executors to sell the wardship to Sir Anthony Wingfield.; . Career Although Knyvet reached the age of majority about 1529, he did not come into his entire inheritance at that time. Knyvet's great-grandfather, Sir William Knyvet (died 1515), had married, as his second wife Joan Stafford, daughter of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, by Anne Neville (1414‚Äì1480), daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland,. and had partly disinherited Sir Edmund Knyvet (died 1504),Sir Edmund Knyvet married Eleanor Tyrrell (died 1514), the daughter of Sir William Tyrrell of Gipping, Suffolk, and sister of Sir James Tyrrell. They had six sons and three daughters, including Edmund Knyvet (died 1 May 1539), esquire, who married Joan Bourchier, the only surviving child of John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners. Sir Edmund Knyvet was drowned at sea in 1504; . his eldest son by his first marriage, by leaving Buckenham Castle and other properties to Sir Edward Knyvet (died 1528), the eldest son of his second marriage to Joan Stafford.Sir Edward Knyvet married Anne Calthorpe, widow of John Cressner, and daughter of Sir John Calthorpe by Elizabeth, daughter of Roger Wentworth, esquire. Sir Edward Knyvet died without issue in 1528. His heir was his nephew, Robert Knyvet, son of his brother, Charles Knyvet (died before 22 October 1528). Robert Knyvet was slain during the suppression of Kett's Rebellion in 1549. Sir Edward Knyvet died childless in 1528, and Sir William Knyvet's lands then reverted to Sir William Knyvet's rightful heir, Edmund Knyvet, who had livery of his lands in 1533.; . By 1527 Knyvet had married Anne Shelton, the daughter of Sir John Shelton of Carrow, Norfolk, and his wife, Anne Boleyn. Knyvet's wife was a sister of Mary Shelton, and a first cousin of Queen Anne Boleyn. Sir Edmund Knyvet and Anne Shelton had two sons,; . the elder of whom, Sir Thomas Knyvett (c. 1528 ‚Äì 22 September 1569), married Catherine Stanley, daughter of Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby,. and Margaret Barlow. Through his marriage Knyvet was closely connected to the Shelton, Boleyn and Howard families. Knyvet joined his uncle, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, in suppressing the uprising in Yorkshire in 1536 known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. He was knighted in 1538 or 1539, and was made sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in November 1539.; . At times Knyvet's relationship with the Duke of Norfolk was strained. According to Virgoe, Norfolk 'always wrote about Knyvet in terms which revealed small sympathy for his hotheaded, conceited and clever young kinsman'.. In 1539 Knyvet's hotheadedness led to an altercation over the election of Edmund Wyndham and Richard Southwell as knights of the shire for Norfolk, as a result of which the Duke bound both Knyvet and Southwell in ¬£2000 to keep the peace and appear in the Star Chamber. In April 1541 Knyvet struck Thomas Clere, a servant of the Duke's son and heir, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, in the King's tennis court. In accordance with a recent statute enacted to curb violence at court, Knyvet was sentenced to have his right hand struck off, a sentence he only narrowly escaped by a last-minute royal pardon. In February 1542 Knyvet was also bound in 500 marks to attend daily before the Privy Council, although for what reason is unknown. Knyvet contributed to the downfall of the Howards in 1546, and testified against Surrey at his treason trial in December of that year. He was rewarded with a lease of the manor of Wymondham and other Howard lands.; . He was appointed High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk for 1539‚Äì40 and took his place on the bench as Justice of the Peace for Norfolk from 1543 to his death. The fall of the Howards paved the way for Knyvet's election as a knight of the shire (MP) for Norfolk in 1547. However, according to Virgoe, he remained 'a thorn in the flesh of authority', being bound in ¬£1000 in February 1548 to attend before the Protector Somerset and the Privy Council to answer charges which may have been related to his alleged adultery with the Countess of Sussex.; . During Kett's Rebellion in the summer of 1549, Knyvet 'led his servants in a spirited attack against the Norfolk rebels', was one of those sent to parley with Kett, and served under John Dudley, Earl of Warwick in the final battle at Mousehold Heath on 27 August 1549. Two years later Knyvet died in London on 1 May 1551.; . It has been suggested that Knyvet was the 'E.K.' who contributed verses to an anthology compiled by his sister-in-law, Mary Shelton.. Knyvet has sometimes been confused with his uncle and namesake, Edmund Knyvet, serjeant porter to King Henry VIII, who died 1 May 1539..

The next year, in 2004, he became the Austrian mountain bike champion and competed in the 2004 Summer Olympic's mountain bike race where he placed 32nd with a time 2:30:14. After failing to qualify for 2008 Olympics in Beijing, Weiss eventually turned to triathlon. Triathlon Weiss took his skill in mountain biking and applied them to the XTERRA Triathlon series. He has had success at the championships in Maui placing second in 2008, third in 2009 and 2010 before winning the championship in 2011.

Doping ban In November 2011, Weiss was given a two‚Äìyear ban for a blood doping infringement in 2005 while competing in mountain biking. An independent commission of Austria's anti-doping agency (Nationale Anti-Doping Agentur Austria, NADA), said that it had found Weiss to be guilty of having his blood taken for enrichment at a blood lab in Vienna in 2005. NADA initially cleared Weiss in September 2010, but that decision was reversed a year later and subsequently issued the ban from competition. Weiss declared his innocence but chose not to appeal the ban, citing the time and expense that would be required to do so.

His discoveries led to the establishment of the German East Africa Protectorate. Early years Paul Reichard was born on 2 December 1854 in Neuwied on the Rhine. He studied in Munich and in 1873 joined the Corps Rheno-Palatia, a student organization. After graduation he was employed for some time as an engineer in Kaiserslautern. In 1880 he volunteered as a member of an expedition of the German African society to establish a scientific station in East Africa. He prepared and equipped himself, taking Swahili lessons, and contributed 50,000 marks of his own money to the cost of the expedition. African exploration At first the leader of the expedition was Captain von Schoeler, and other members were the zoologist Richard Boehm and the topographer Edward Kaiser. In July 1880 they marched into the interior of what is now Tanzania from the port of Bagamoyo. In November, they founded the Kakoma station in Unjamwesi, and stayed there for nine months. Captain von Scholer returned to Europe via Zanzibar after founding the station at Kakama. In 1881 Boehm and Reichard explored the Wala River, to the west of Gondo, as far as its mouth. Boehm and Kaiser made a three-month expedition to Lake Tanganyika, returning to the Gondo station at the end of 1881. Later a station was established at Igonda. Reichard said of the Ufipa of the Rukwa region to the east of Lake Tanganyika that \\"calm, peace and order\\" reigned within the Fipa state. He described the rule of King Kapuufi as \\"generally energetic, but nevertheless mild\\". In October 1882 Eduard Kaiser died on an expedition to Lake Rukwa. In December 1882, Reichard and B√∂hm left Igonda and traveled to Lake Tanganyika, exploring Karema in Tanzania and Mpala to the west of the lake in the Congo Free State. Boehm and Reichard left the Belgian station of Mpala on the Tanganyika on 1 September 1883. They managed to cross the Luapala into a country then called \\"Urua\\". Reichard crossed the Luapula twice, finding it was only wide, with many waterfalls and rapids as it drops down through the Konde Irunde and Mitumba mountains. Boehm died on 27 March 1884. Reichard observed that the Lualaba River was between and wide and appeared to be the true source of the Congo based on volume of water. He found that the Lualaba flows through Lake Upemba and then through Kikonja Lake further to the north. Reichard travelled up the Lufira River to the copper mines of Katanga, of which the Europeans were already aware. He reported that the Katanga region was subject to the powerful chief Msiri. The discoveries forced a number of revisions of the map of central Africa. He struggled back to the east, reaching Zanzibar on the Indian Ocean coast in November 1884. Later career In 1889 Reichard criticized the German government for making the mistake of treating the Sultan Seyid Bargash of Zanzibar in the same way as a European monarch. He said that when the German fleet visited it should have simply occupied the sultanate. Reichard and B√∂hm had made significant land acquisitions in the territories they explored, and Reichard called for a German protectorate, which came into formal existence with the signature of an agreement between Germany and Britain on 1 July 1890. He wrote numerous reports on the expedition that appeared in the Communications of the German African society. In 1888 Reichard published observations on African slavery, saying that the trade is mainly conducted by Africans rather than Arabs. He said that 80% to 98% of Africans were slaves, with only the chiefs and their relatives being free. The owner had to treat his slaves well or they would simply run away to become a slave elsewhere. A comment on these assertions in the Journal of the American Geographical and Statistical Society said \\"Mr. Reichard's reasoning shows he has kept his nature unspotted from the world, and is more guileless than any one but a slave owner or a chief\\". In 1889 Reichard published an exhaustive account of African ivory and the ivory trade. The accompanying map showed the range of elephants extending throughout sub-Saharan Africa, but showed that already in most regions they had been driven back from the coastal lands. He distinguished between the more valuable soft ivory from elephants that live in open woodlands and short-grass savannahs, and the less valuable hard ivory from elephants of the jungles and long-grassed savannahs. The trade at that time was dominated by Arabs based on Zanzibar in the east and by Portuguese in Angola in the west. After his return to Europe, Reichard lived in Nice for a while, then moved to Berlin-Charlottenburg, where he died on 19 September 1938 and was buried in the Southwest Stahnsdorf churchyard.

The third edition of the Best Practices builds on the foundation established in the first and second editions which were published in 2005 and 2008, respectively.  Current Best Practices  ISBER Best Practices For Repositories: Collection, Storage, Retrieval and Distribution of Biological Materials for Research provides repository professionals with standardized guidelines for the management of biobank specimen collections and repositories. The most current version of the ISBER Best Practices was published in Biopreservation and Biobanking (BIO), April 2012 issue.  Self- Assessment Tool (SAT)  = SAT Information = The tool contains 158 questions which may be answered in a single or multiple sessions. Each page of the survey corresponds to a section of the ISBER Best Practices. Results from pilot tests indicated that the SAT takes a little over an hour to complete if all required information is available at the time of completing the survey. The tool is free to ISBER members, and non-members may participate for a fee. After completion of the SAT, a personalized e-mail is sent to the participant which includes a \\"risk-balanced assessment score\\" and notification of top deviation areas to help the participant evaluate how their current practices conform to the ISBER Best Practices. The score is based on possible risk to the specimens, frequency of implementation of each practice, and the ease with which deviations can be detected. Biorepository Proficiency Testing Program Developed in collaboration with the Integrated Biobank of Luxembourg (IBBL), the Biorepository Proficiency Testing Program is designed to allow biorepositories to assess the accuracy of their quality control assays and characterization of biospecimens. Participants can compare their results with those obtained in other laboratories and can identify testing issues that may be related to individual staff performance or calibration of instrumentation used in biospecimen quality control. The program provides guidance to biorepositories so they can take appropriate remedial action to be in compliance with ISO/IEC 17043:2010, providing a necessary External Quality Assessment tool for biorepositories who wish to seek accreditation (ISO 17025, CLIA or equivalent).

Ideologically this group shares many similar beliefs with other Old Order Mennonites groups, but also with Conservative Mennonites though differing in not having Sunday Schools or revival meetings. They identify more with the values of the Old Order groups but share common core values or distinctives.  History  In the early 20th century, some of the Old Order Mennonites in Ontario and Pennsylvania began to use automobiles instead of horses and buggies, which resulted in a great deal of tension within the Old Order congregations. Because of this, \\"The Old Orders of Waterloo had ceased to affiliate with Markham in 1930 because of the automobile issue.\\"Martin, Donald. Old Order Mennonites of Ontario: Gelassenheit, Discipleship, Brotherhood; Pandora Press, Kitchener, Ontario, 2003; p.236. From 1931 the MWMC had been known as the Markham Mennonite Conference. When a significant group of Old Order Mennonites from the Waterloo County area of Ontario joined with the Markham church in the 1930s, the new MWMC church was formed in 1939.Martin, Donald.

Thiessen. (October 2010). Weaverland Mennonite Conference. Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online. Retrieved 13 December 2011 In 2003, MWMC layman Donald Martin (ordained deacon in 2004) published a book entitled \\"Old Order Mennonites of Ontario: Gelassenheit, Discipleship, and Brotherhood\\" (Pandora Press, Kitchener, Ontario). His book is a detailed study of the history of most of the Old Order groups in Ontario, including the MWMC, the Old Order Mennonite Conference, the David Martin Mennonites, and the Orthodox Mennonites. This book also contains a primer on basic Old Order Mennonite beliefs. A more detailed study of Old Order Mennonite beliefs was published by the same author in 2007 called Distinctive Teachings of the Old Order People (Vineyard Publications, Wallenstein, Ontario). It explains Old Order Mennonite beliefs on issues such as 'Salvation', 'Discipleship', 'The Church', and 'Separation from the World'.  Doctrine and practice  The MWMC \\"Statement of Faith\\"Markham Waterloo Mennonite Conference Report and General Recommendations, January 2010, edited 2011 in brief indicates that \\"The Word of God, as revealed in the Scriptures, is the basis for the faith and practice of the Church. Salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ; the Apostolic Confession of Faith and the Dordrecht Eighteen Articles of Faith are taught and supported.\\" Of the three historic creeds then, the MWMC supports the Apostles' Creed, but rejects the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed. The full text of the Dordrecht Confession of Faith of 1632 is reprinted in the church's booklet \\"Origin and Doctrine of the Mennonites\\" (shared by the Old Order Mennonite Conference), published in 1999. Within this booklet, the text of one of the writings of Menno Simons clarifies the MWMC belief of their view of the Trinity: \\"And thus we believe and confess ... that these three names, operations and powers, namely, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are one incomprehensible, indescribable, almighty, holy, only, eternal and sovereign God,\\".Origin and Doctrine of the Mennonites, Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference, 1999, p. 51. Simons continues, \\"And although they are three, yet in godliness, will, power and operation they are one, and can no more be separated from each other than the sun, brightness, and warmth;\\".Origin and Doctrine of the Mennonites, Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference, 1999, p. 51. This view is re-affirmed in the first article of the Dordrecht Confession of Faith, \\"Of God and the Creation of All Things\\", where it states, \\"Therefore we ... believe ... according to Holy Scripture, in one eternal, Almighty, and incomprehensible God - Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,\\".Origin and Doctrine of the Mennonites, Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference, 1999, p. 106. The MWMC regards salvation as \\"a life process that (calls) for perseverance to the end.\\"Martin, Donald. Distinctive Teachings of the Old Order People; Vineyard Publications, Wallenstein, Ontario, 2007; p. 33. In his second book, Deacon Donald Martin states clearly that, for Anabaptists, \\"obedience and discipleship (are) also part of one's salvation\\".Martin, Donald. Distinctive Teachings of the Old Order People; Vineyard Publications, Wallenstein, Ontario, 2007; p. 30. Martin reminds the reader that, \\"The Sixth Article (of the Dordrecht Confession) states that we become justified children of God ... after we have repented and amended our lives.\\"Martin, Donald. Distinctive Teachings of the Old Order People; Vineyard Publications, Wallenstein, Ontario, 2007; pp. 33-34 The MWMC Conference Report and General Recommendations briefly spells out the agreed upon expectations for membership in the church. Articles include the \\"Holy Life\\", \\"Courtship and Marriage\\", \\"Nonresistance\\", \\"Separation from the State\\", \\"Types and Places of Employment\\", \\"Uniformity Within the Church\\" and \\"Nonconformity to the world\\".Markham Waterloo Mennonite Conference Report and General Recommendations, January 2010, edited 2011 It is also expected that members primarily drive black vehicles. Members cautiously use technologies like mobile phones, computers, and the Internet, but do not own televisions or radios. The MWMC has its own parochial school system, which began in 1973. It shares some of its schools with the Ontario Old Order Mennonite Conference.Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference Parochial Schools: Constitution, April 2009  Members and congregations  In 1957 the Markham- Waterloo Mennonite Conference had 748 baptized members.Old Order Mennonites at Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online. In 2011 membership had risen to 1,500 baptized members in 17 congregations.Directory of the Markham- Waterloo Mennonite Congregation 2011 There are 15 congregations in Southwestern Ontario, 1 in Eastern Ontario, and 1 in Northeastern Ontario.

Ministry  The Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference ordains deacons, ministers, and bishops from within their congregations by a process called \\"the lot\\". As of July 2012, there were 3 bishops, 19 ministers, and 18 deacons. Of the bishops, the longest-serving is Ernie Wideman, ordained as a minister in 1976, and as a bishop in 1986. Among the ministers, the longest-serving is Emerson Bauman, ordained in 1959; and among the deacons, Ralph Reibel is the longest-serving, ordained in 1983.Mennonite Calendar of Appointments 2012 Eighty First Edition, Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference The ministry is unpaid, and are self-employed as farmers or work in other related occupations.  Succession of bishops  The Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference Succession of Bishops descends from the Weaverland Old Order Mennonite Conference. The Weaverland Old Order Bishops Moses Horning and Joseph Hostetter ordained Abraham Smith as a bishop in 1936 (ordained minister in 1927; died 1980). Bishops Abraham Smith, Joseph Hostetter (Pennsylvania), Moses Horst (Ohio), and William Ramer (Indiana) ordained Amsey Martin as a bishop in 1941 (minister in 1940; died 1985). Orvie Brubacher (minister 1976; died 1986) was ordained in 1979 by Bishops Abraham Smith, Amsey Martin, Luke Good (Pennsylvania), and Willis Martin (Pennsylvania).

Traditionally, one candle is lit each Sunday until four candles are lit on the 24th. At 6:00 pm Church bells ring to start the Christmas celebration. The religiously observant and/or traditional Icelanders will attend mass at this time while the secular Icelanders will begin their holiday meal immediately. After the meal is finished, they open gifts and spend the evening together. In Iceland people over the Yule holidays most often eat smoked lamb, ptarmigan and turkey. Pork is also very popular. Thirteen days before December 24, children will leave their shoes by the window so that the 13 Yule Lads (j√≥lasveinarnir) can leave small gifts in their shoes. Yule Lads are the sons of two trolls, Gr√Ωla and Leppal√∫√∞i, living in the Icelandic mountains. Each of the Yule Lads is known for a different kind of mischief (for example slamming doors, stealing meat, stealing milk or eating the candles). Yule Lads traditionally wear early Icelandic wool clothing but are now known for the more recognizable red and white suit. Each home typically sets up a Christmas tree indoors in the living room with most decorating it on December 11. In addition to the decorations, presents are put underneath the tree. It is also a tradition in many homes to boil fish (skate) on the 23rd. The day is known as Saint Thorlak mass (√ûorl√°ksmessa). During the holiday season, it is traditional for families to work together to bake small cookies to serve or give to guests. Most common are thin gingerbread cookies which are decorated in many different colors of glaze. Many families also follow the tradition of making laufabrau√∞, a flat thin bread that is cut out using a special tool and folding technique. The end of year is divided between two days ‚Äì the Old Year's Day (Gaml√°rsdagur) and the New Year's Day (N√Ω√°rsdagur). At the night of the former and morning of the latter Icelanders shoot up fireworks blowing the old year away and welcoming the new one. Thirteen days after the 24th, Icelanders say goodbye to the Yule Lads and other mystical creatures such as elves and trolls. There are bonfires held throughout the country while the elves, Yule Lads, and Icelanders dance together before saying goodbye until the next Christmas. This celebration is known elsewhere as Epiphany Day.

Description Fungia sp. Corals of Fungia fungites are mostly solitary, some attaining in diameter. The juveniles attach themselves to rock but larger individuals detach themselves and become free living. They are found in various bright colours including white, pink, red, purple, blue and yellow and are popular with keepers of reef aquariums. The discs are either round or oval and the central mouth, which is surrounded by tentacles, may be a slit. The polyp sits in a calcareous cup, the corallite. The septa are vertical skeletal elements inside the corallite wall and the costae join the septae and continue outside the corallite wall and underneath the coral. Both the septae and costae are robust. Fungia fungites may be confused with specimens of the related genus Cycloseris but the latter are always free living, even as juveniles, while the former bear a scar showing where they were attached when young. Fungia corals, like other large polyp stony corals, have developed several feeding strategies. They also capture planktonic organisms, food particles from the water column, and can absorb dissolved organic matter. Feeding tentacles are usually visible at night. Fungia also reproduce asexually. Daughter colonies / polyps may form and they will form offspring from broken pieces. they show regeneration.

The vehicle was displayed for the first time in 2007, during the International Defence Exhibition and Conference in Abu Dhabi. The Matador was officially launched the following year, at the 2008 African Aerospace and Defence exhibition in Cape Town, South Africa. Vehicle specs With a curb weight of 10,800 kg and a payload weight of 4,500 kg, the Matador has a maximum crew capacity of fourteen, including a driver and co-driver. The vehicle has a cruise speed of 100 km/h and a maximum range of 700 km. Although it can be used for military and peacekeeping operations in urban areas, it was originally designed for missions in less built-up areas. It therefore has a larger turning circle compared to its sister vehicle, the Marauder, which was specifically developed for urban areas. The Matador is either equipped with a militarised MAN engine integrated with a 12-speed semi-automatic transmission, or a Cummins engine integrated with a fully automated 6-speed transmission. Both technologies are common around the world, allowing the vehicle to be repaired and serviced in most countries, without requiring an independent logistic system. Armour The Matador is fitted with a double-skin monocoque hull, which gives it a modern look and a smooth finish while protecting its occupants against blasts up to STANAG 4569 Level III, the highest level of tested protection. The V-shaped hull comprises three self-jigging plates. This system, developed in South Africa, enables the Matador to withstand the blast of a double anti-tank mine (14 kg of TNT) at any point beneath the hull, and a triple anti-tank mine (21 kg of TNT) under any wheel. Armament The vehicle can be equipped with light and medium-calibre machine guns and cannon weapon installations, as well as mortar firing platforms, missile launchers, combat turret, and command, surveillance and control systems. Functions The Matador can be converted to serve various purposes and roles, such as armoured ambulance, command-post vehicle, or utility mine-protected vehicle. Production In 2008, for the manufacturing and production of the Matador, the Paramount Group liaised with King Abdullah II of Jordan and the Design and Development Bureau (KADDB), Jordan‚Äôs primary governmental military institute for the possible development and manufacturing of defence systems.

The copper is then taken to the concentrator. There are three types of mining methods currently in use at Mufulira mine site. The first is the original drill and blast underground mining method (MCR ‚Äì Mechanised Continuous Retreat or modified Sub Level Caving) used in Mufulira main, secondly Room and Pillar with waste rock backfill employed at Mufulira East Portal, and thirdly Insitu Leaching of old stopes.  Mufulira Concentrator  The Concentrator operates in a conventional manner, and has a capacity of 8,500 tonnes of ore per day. Primary stage crushing of ore is done underground while the secondary and tertiary stage crushing take place at the Concentrator. Ball mills grind the crushed ore for subsequent flotation to produce a copper concentrate grade of 40-43%. Concentrator recovery is approximately 94.5%.

Mufulira Refinery (including agitation leach, heap leach, SX & EW plants) In the refinery, copper anodes coming from the smelter are electro-refined to produce cathodes having 99.99% Cu and conforming to LME grade A. This is done by putting anodes and cathodes alternately in a cell, in which copper sulphate electrolyte solution is circulated and current is passed. Copper ions thus generated from anodes move towards cathode and get deposited on starter plates [cathodes]. The cathode plates are taken out from the cells at a certain interval. The cathodes thus produced are bundled and are mostly exported. During electrolysis precious metals like gold, silver, platinum, selenium, palladium etc. settle down along with other impurities at the bottom of the cells. This is removed and collected at the end of anode cycle. This product known as anode slime is washed, dried packed and exported for recovering precious metals. At the refinery there are also three SX plants and one electrowinning plant. PLS from the Agitation Leach, Mufulira West heap leach and In-Situ Leach operations are first treated at SX Plants and then taken to the electrowinning plant for the production of copper cathodes.  Mine Collapse  Overnight on 25 September 1970, the bottom of Tailings Pond #3 failed, causing approximately 1 million tons of tailings and mud to drain into the mine. This facility was positioned directly above the underground workings. 89 mine workers from the night shift were killed, and a sinkhole at the bottom of the drained pond remained, allowing surface water to continue to pour into the workings. Two years prior to this, a series of sinkholes had started to develop within the #3 Tailings Pond as the result of underground hanging wall collapse, and two instances of mud ingress had been recorded. Nkana Mine Nkana mine is one of the largest in Africa,Nkana Mine Mindat.org a copper mine located 1 km south-west of Kitwe.

In the 1931 census, more than 450,000 registered themselves as members of the new indigenous faith called Ad Dharam (or Original Religion). But this faith and movement vanished after India's independence because of major concentration of its leader into state politics and govt.'s reservation policy only for low-caste from Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist communities.

Judge Davis was appointed to the Utah Court of Appeals in 1993 by Governor Michael O. Leavitt. He served a two-year term as presiding judge in January 1999 and is currently serving as presiding judge.  Judicial career  Judge Davis was certified by the Utah Judicial Council to stand for retention in 2008 and was successfully retained in office by the Utah voters for the third time.  Selected Cases   State of Utah v Duhaime 2011 UT App 209  On January 14, 2009, a highway patrolman out looking for drug activity observed a Lincoln Town Car with Texas license plates, driven by Duhaime, traveling eastbound on Interstate 80 in Summit County. The patrolman ran a check on the car's license plate number and discovered that it was a rental car. The patrolman claimed that the rear license plate light was not working. He also observed the driver make what the patrolman claimed to be an illegal lane change. At approximately 11:06 p.m., on the pretext of the foregoing violations, the patrolman pulled the car over. The encounter with Duhaime and his wife (Wife) was recorded by a camera in the patrolman's vehicle. The patrolman began to question Duhaime about travel plans and concluded that the driver's answers were inconsistent and nervously spoken. After returning to his car the patrolman called another patrolman and ordered him to bring a dog to sniff the car for drugs. Duhaime and his wife were retained at the sight until the dog came. When the dog arrived, it alerted on the trunk of the car, where the officers subsequently found seventy-six one-pound vacuum-sealed bags of marijuana. Duhaime was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, a third-degree felony. Duhaime filed a motion to suppress the marijuana evidence, arguing that the patrolman lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him for an equipment or traffic violation and that the detention was longer than necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop. The trial court found that the patrolman's testimony regarding the license plate light was credible, that no contrary testimony was presented, and that it was unclear from the video whether the light was functioning. On appeal, Judge Davis authored the opinion of the court and concluded: \\"The trial court did not err in concluding that the stop in this case was justified at its inception, and the patrolman's testimony about the stop was not so implausible as to justify our reassessing his credibility on appeal. However, the totality of the circumstances did not support a reasonable suspicion that Duhaime was transporting drugs, and Duhaime was illegally seized when he was detained to await the drug detection dog. We therefore reverse the trial court's denial of Duhaime's motion to suppress, and we remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\"  State of Utah v Watkins 2011 UT App 96  In September 2008, Watkins accepted a job with his niece's husband (Father). Watkins temporarily moved in with his niece (Stepmother) and Father until he could afford to get a place of his own. Three of the Father and Stepmother's children lived with them during the time Watkins stayed at their home. Additionally, the Father's ten-year-old child from a previous relationship (Child) visited the Father and Stepmother \\"regularly\\" while Watkins was living with them. Three years prior, Watkins had lost his son and stepdaughter in a tragic accident. Following the accident, his marriage suffered and he and his wife were eventually divorced. On approximately October 15, 2008, Watkins's ex-wife remarried. That same day, the Child stayed at the Father's home overnight. Upset about his ex-wife's remarriage, Watkins drank a significant amount of alcohol while the other three children were all sleeping in her room. After the Child had fallen asleep she woke up to find Watkins in bed with her kissing her on the side of her head. She asked him to stop and to leave, but then he began \\"pinching\\" or \\"rubbing\\" her buttocks with his hand. Child also testified at trial and in her interview that he \\"spanker her butt.\\" Watkins finally left after Child told him to leave a second time, but he then returned and gave her a $100 bill, telling her not to tell anyone about the money. Following the incident the Child no longer wished to visit the Father's home while Watkins was there and after a couple weeks the Stepmother asked what was wrong. The Child disclosed the details of the incident to her mother, Stepmother, and Father. The incident was reported and Watkins was arrested. Watkins was charged with aggravated sexual abuse of a child, a first degree felony. At trial, after the State rested its case, Watkins moved to dismiss, arguing that the State had failed to prove that he was in a position of special trust with respect to the child that he had acted with the \\"intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\\" The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. The jury convicted Watkins and he was sentenced to ten years to life in prison. On appeal, Judge Davis authored the opinion of the court and concluded: \\"The trial court did not err by denying Watkins's motion to dismiss because there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found both that he was in a position of special trust with the respect to the Child and that he had the requisite intent to arouse or gratify his sexual desires. Furthermore, the trial court did not err in denying Watkins's motion for a new trial because the text messages between Stepmother and Sister did not support any theory advanced by the defense at trial, did not demonstrate that Stepmother had lied in her testimony, where cumulative of evidence already presented at trial, and were not probative of sexual intent. We therefore affirm.\\"  Commonwealth Property v Mortgage Electric 2011 UT App 232  A home buyer (Home Buyer) executed a promissory note (the Note) in favor of her lending bank (Lender) for $417,000 secured under the terms of a Deed of Trust describing property in Eagle Mountain, Utah, as collateral for the debt. The Deed of Trust identified MERS as the \\"nominee for Lender and Lender's successors and assigns\\" and as the \\"beneficiary under this Security Instrument.\\" In the original Note, Lender assigned its servicing rights to Citi, which at all relevant times remained the servicer of the Note and to which Home Buyer made payments. Home Buyer defaulted on the Note, and on approximately December 8, 2009, the Successor Trustee to the Deed of Trust recorded a Notice of Default and Election to Sell.1 On December 6, 2009, MERS assigned its \\"beneficial interest\\" to Citi, which was recorded on January 6, 2010. On December 31, 2009, a quitclaim deed was recorded by which Home Buyer transferred her interest in the Eagle Mountain property to CPA. CPA filed a complaint in February 2010 that stated four causes of action based upon its assertion that the Deed of Trust was separated from the Note shortly after being executed and therefore is and \\"has been unenforceable by defendant[s]\\" for quite some time. MERS and Citi moved to dismiss CPA's complaint, stating that CPA's argument \\"that transferring a note secured by a trust deed as part of a securities transaction renders the note an unsecured obligation . . . is without legal support and fails as a matter of law.\\" In its memorandum decision, the district court converted the motion to dismiss to one for summary judgment because of what it determined to be extraneous document evidence attached to both parties' pleadings. (\\"[A] motion to dismiss 'shall be converted into one for summary judgment if matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court.'\\" (quoting Utah R. Civ. P. 12(b))). The district court subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of MERS and Citi. In rendering its decision, the district court ruled that \\"[t]he premise underlying each of [CPA's] causes of action is an assertion that Defendants lost the right to initiate foreclosure proceedings on the property when the Note was 'securitized.'\\" The district court then characterized this underlying principle as a \\"mere conclusory allegation,\\" and found that \\"the express terms of the Trust Deed unassailably provide that MERS has the right to foreclose upon the Property, even if [Lender] sold the Note.\\" CPA moved to reconsider on the ground that the conversion of the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment was improper. The district court denied CPA's motion to reconsider. CPA now appeals from the final summary judgment order, arguing again that the district court's conversion of the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment was improper. CPA requests that we reverse and remand with instructions for the district court to deny MERS and Citi's motion to dismiss based on its assertion that its \\"underlying principle\\"‚Äê‚Äêthat securitization stripped MERS and Citi of the right to initiate foreclosure proceedings on the Eagle Mountain property‚Äê‚Äêis a factual statement. Judge Davis offered the opinion of the court: CPA's \\"underlying principle\\" that securitization nullified MERS's and Citi's rights as expressly set forth in the Deed of Trust is an incorrect legal assertion. Thus, even if the district court had not converted Defendants' motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, its ruling on the motion to dismiss would have produced the same result‚Äê‚Äêa dismissal of CPA's case. In other words, any presumed error in converting the motion was harmless. Therefore, we affirm the district court's order dismissing CPA's complaint.

The Bank's counsel later informed Bud Bailey and the trial court that the Bank had placed a lien on the funds and that it would thereafter provide the court with a \\"proper response to the garnishment.\\" On the day of the hearing on the order of show cause, the Bank filed its Response to the Garnishment and Order to show cause in re Contempt, claiming a right to offset the funds to satisfy over $300,000 in outstanding loans made by the Bank to Construction Associates and providing documents evidencing its security interest in the checking account. The court continued the hearing to April 2, 2007. Bud Bailey subsequently discovered that Construction Associates had deposited additional funds into its checking account after the writ of garnishment was issued and that the Bank had permitted Construction Associates to draw on those funds. In an order issued May 9, 2007, the trial court found that the Bank was no in compliance with the garnishment statute and that it failed to provide any notice of an offset of right to offset within the required time period. The court further found that the Bank violated an order of the court contained in the writ by allowing checks drawn on funds deposited after the writ of garnishment was issued to clear rather than using them to pay the garnishment. As a result, the trial court ordered the Bank to pay the entire sum remaining on the garnishment, $38,769.71, as well as Bud Bailey's attorney fees. The bank appealed, conceding that it had erred by failing to claim the offset in its response to the interrogatories but arguing that the writ of garnishment did not apply to the after-deposited funds. This court agreed, holding that \\"the Writ of Garnishment only had effect with regard to the funds that were held by the Bank at the time the Write was served. However, we remanded with instructions for the trial court to make \\"a determination for what amount, if any, Bank should be required to pay solely for its failure to answer adequately the interrogatory served with the Writ.\\" On remand, the trial court found that the Bank had \\"failed to provide any adequate justification for its failure to properly respond to Bud Bailey's garnishment interrogatory regarding the offsets.\\" The trial court found that the just amount to assess against the bank for its failures is the full amount that it held for Construction Associates at the time Bud Bailey served its writ of garnishment plus his attorney fees. The bank appeals. Judge Davis offered the opinion of the court and concluded: The trial court erred in assessing a penalty against the Bank for its failure to correctly answer the interrogatory. Furthermore, the trial court made no factual findings to support an assessment of liability against the Bank for any amount beyond the attorney fees incurred as a result of the Bank's error. Finally, an appropriate award of attorney fees to Bud Bailey was no limited to fees incurred before the Bank informed Bud Bailey of its error. We reverse and remand for the trial court to conduct a new evidentiary hearing to determine the amount of damages, if any; to reassess the award of attorney fees; and to determine the appropriate amount of attorney fees to which Bud Bailey is entitled on appeal.\\"  References  Category:1943 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Politicians from Ogden, Utah Category:Politicians from Salt Lake City Category:University of Utah alumni Category:S.J.

She played a significant role in the preservation and development of Ukrainian folklore. During her life, she collected and published more than 100 Ukrainian folk tales and over 1200 folk proverbs. She also authored research and memoirs on Opanas Markovych, Leonid Hlibov, Ivan Franko, and Borys Hrinchenko, among others. Biography She was born in 1863 as Maria Gladilina near Bohodukhiv, a daughter of a minor official in the local government. Her family's status afforded her a good education; she studied history, literature and several foreign languages. She married Borys Hrinchenko, who, together with her father, was instrumental in the foundation of Kharkiv University. She was a member of Kharkiv academy. Her last years at academy were considered as her most active ones. She met her lifelong friends and later correspondents during this part of her education life. She also became close to the new young principal during her last days in the academy. After leaving academy, she attended female seminary for a brief period of ten months, cut short most likely due to poor health. Career Hrinchenko wrote her first works in German, beginning in 1880. Besides a proficiency in German she spoke Ukrainian as well as Polish. Taras Shevchenko and Ivan Franko were the main inspiration of her early poetry. It was associated with the poet's loneliness, social isolation and by an adoration of Ukrainian nation‚Äôs freedom. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1898. In 1887-1893 she worked as a teacher in a people school of Khrystyna Alchevska that today is located in Luhansk Oblast. Influences In addition to Shevchenko and Franko, Hrinchenko's work was influenced by Henrik Ibsen, Edmondo De Amicis and Leo Tolstoy. External links * Skrypnyk, P.

They are found in the Indo-Pacific. They inhabit the lower reef slopes, and the areas between reefs with soft sediments. They tolerate turbid waters.  Description  Corals in the genus Cycloseris are mostly solitary and free living, some attaining in diameter. The discs are either round or oval and the central mouth, which is surrounded by tentacles, may be a slit. The polyp sits in a calcareous cup, the corallite, and only extends its tentacles to feed at night. The septa are vertical skeletal elements inside the corallite wall and the costae unite the septae at the base of the coral. In the genus Cycloseris, both are thick but have fine teeth and are characteristic of the different species. Cycloseris can be confused with specimens of the related genus Fungia but the former are free living, even as juveniles, while the latter bear a scar showing where they were attached when young. The genus was reclassified in 2012, to include some species that had previously been classified in the genus Coscinaraea, that are colonial with multiple mouths, in addition to the original species that are free living, with a single central mouth.

The full title of the book is: Race Against the Machine: How the Digital Revolution Is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy. Contents The main thesis of the book is that we are in the midst of a technological revolution that is radically redefining what work is, how value is created, and how the economy distributes that value. In particular, the authors observe that after the Great Recession of 2007‚Äì2008, many measures of economic health (such as GDP, corporate profits, and investment in equipment and software) rebounded quickly, while unemployment lagged behind, which they attribute to technology eliminating the need for many forms of human labor. Examples of technology they point to are robotics, numerically controlled machines, computerized inventory management software, speech recognition, speaker recognition, language translation, self-driving vehicles, pattern recognition and online commerce. The authors write that businesses are increasingly substituting machines for people, and that rate at which digital technologies are advancing is exponentially higher than that of the organizations, institutions, and individuals within our economy. Additionally, the corporate use of equipment and software is increasing faster than the rate of employment.Steve Lohr, More Jobs Predicted for Machines, Not People, book review in The New York Times, 2011.10.23Andrew Keen, Keen On How The Internet Is Making Us Both Richer and More Unequal (TCTV), interview with Andrew McAfee and Erik Brynjolfsson, TechCrunch, 2011.11.15JILL KRASNY, MIT Professors: The 99% Should Shake Their Fists At The Tech Boom, Business Insider, 2011.11.25Ascher Schechter, After the Working Class, Technology is Eliminating the Middle Class, TheMarker, 2013.01.11. Quotations and citations in this Wikipedia article are based on the translation from Hebrew to English of the TheMarker article.Scott Timberg, The Clerk, RIP, Salon.com, 2011.12.18 Brynjolfsson and McAfee write that advanced digital technologies are making people more innovative, productive and richer, both in the short- and long-term, but potentially at the cost of increasing wealth inequality in society. In the authors' view, one of the main in-egalitarian consequences of digital technological developments is its potentially negative impact on some types of employment, such as routine information processing work. The authors appear to advocate for a collaborative partnership between computers and humans as the road to future job creation. \\"In medicine, law, finance, retailing, manufacturing and even scientific discovery,\\" they write, \\"the key to winning the race is not to compete against machines but to compete with machines.\\" Recommendations Given the advancement of technology, the authors have several recommendations for policymakers in the United States to increase economic prosperity, including:http://ebusiness.mit.edu/erik/ma2012_brynjolfsson_mcafee.pdf * Investing more in education, starting with increasing teacher salaries * More accountability for teachers on performance metrics, possibly including the elimination of tenure * Focus education on useful outcomes and less on signaling prestige, time, or effort, by separating instruction from certification and testing * More instructional hours per year for K-12 students * Expand immigration of entrepreneurs and skilled workers, including both permanent residents and H1-B * Teach entrepreneurship skills in higher education (outside of business schools) * Speed the creation of startups with franchise opportunities, online guides, and clearinghouses * Reduce regulatory barriers to new business creation * Invest more in communication and transportation infrastructure improvements * Invest more in government funding for basic research * Maintain labor market fluidity and the ability to hire and fire * Reduce payroll taxes (to make it more attractive to hire a person rather than a machine) and increase taxes on congestion and pollution * De- couple health insurance from employment * Keep crowdsourcing businesses like Amazon Mechanical Turk lightly regulated to allow experimentation * Eliminate tax breaks for home mortgages and reallocate the proceeds to education and research * Reduce government subsidies for the financial services industry, to free talent for other industries * Reform the patent system, and speed up patent adjudication * Reduce the length of copyright terms and expand fair use Criticism Like Jeremy Rifkin's book The End of Work, The Race against the Machine has been criticized for lacking credible evidence in making predictions about future job loss.E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away?

Church, Nashville; built in 1925 Morris Memorial Building, Nashville; built in 1925 St. John's Baptist Church, Miami; built in 1940 McKissack & McKissack is an American architecture and engineering firm based for many years in Nashville, Tennessee, and now based in New York City and Washington, D.C. Founded in 1905, it was the first African-American-owned architectural firm in the United States and is the oldest African American-owned architecture and engineering firm in the country. History The firm was founded by brothers Moses McKissack III (May 8, 1879 ‚Äì December 12, 1952) and Calvin Lunsford McKissack (February 23, 1890 ‚Äì March 2, 1968), natives of Pulaski, Tennessee. Their father and grandfather were trained builders. Moses McKissack entered the architecture trade by working as an apprentice to a builder in Pulaski who hired him in 1890 to assist with architectural designs, drawings and construction work. His formal education was obtained at the Pulaski Colored High School. Calvin McKissack was educated at Barrows School in Springfield, Massachusetts, and Fisk University in Nashville, which he attended from 1905 to 1909. Both brothers obtained architectural degrees through a correspondence course. Early projects Between 1895 and 1905, Moses McKissack built houses in Decatur, Alabama, and Mount Pleasant and Columbia, Tennessee. In 1905, he received a commission to build a new house for the dean of architecture and engineering at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. He opened his first architectural office in Nashville and quickly picked up additional jobs designing and building other homes in the West End. The firm's first major project was design of the Carnegie Library on the Fisk University campus. This is a two-story Classic Revival building constructed from brick with a stone columned porch, featuring an interior light well; its cornerstone was laid in 1908 by William Howard Taft, then the U.S. Secretary of War. Major projects designed by Moses McKissack during the 1910s included the main campus building for the Turner Normal and Industrial School for Negroes in Shelbyville, Tennessee and dormitories for Roger Williams University in Nashville and Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee. By 1920, Moses McKissack had acquired design clients throughout Nashville. Between 1918 and 1922 he designed more than one dozen residences in Nashville and Belle Meade, largely in the Colonial Revival style. Calvin McKissack, who had worked with his older brother in Nashville, started an independent practice in Dallas, Texas, in 1912, specializing in the design and construction of dormitories and churches. In 1915, he returned to Tennessee, becoming superintendent of industries and a teacher of architectural drawing at the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State Normal School. Three years later, he joined the faculty of Pearl High School as director of the industrial arts department, and later became first executive secretary of the Tennessee State Association of Teachers in Colored Schools. After Tennessee instituted a registration law for architects in 1921, the McKissack brothers became two of the first registered architects in the state. Moses' granddaughter Cheryl said in an interview that state licensing authorities were reluctant to let the brothers take the licensing exam, but decided to allow it based on the expectation that they would fail. After they passed easily, the state authorities balked at giving them licenses, but relented after reports of the situation were published in national news media. Establishment of partnership In 1922, Calvin McKissack resigned his job with the teachers organization and the brothers established the partnership of McKissack & McKissack. In 1924, the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A, Inc., hired the firm to design the Morris Memorial Building to house the Nashville offices of the denomination's Sunday School Publishing Board. After the building was completed in 1925, the McKissack firm moved its offices into that building, where they remained for many years. In 1927 the McKissacks designed the main library of Tennessee State University in Nashville. During the 1930s they received Works Progress Administration contracts for design of several public school buildings in the city, including Washington Junior High School on Nineteenth Avenue North (demolished), Pearl High School, and Ford Green School. Around 1940, the firm began to expand outside Tennessee. Architectural licensing boards in some other states were skeptical of the qualifications of black architects. Tennessee authorities responded to their concerns with a statement that McKissack and McKissack was \\"...somewhat unique in the fact that it is one of the few Negro architectural firms in the country\\" and had \\"done some creditable work in Nashville, including several large school buildings running into a total cost of several hundred thousand dollars\\". The firm received licenses from Alabama in 1941 and from Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, and Mississippi in 1943. In 1942, the McKissack won a $5.7 million U.S. federal government contract to design and build Tuskegee Army Airfield, home to the Tuskegee Airmen's 99th Pursuit Squadron, in Tuskegee, Alabama. At the time, this was the largest federal contract ever awarded to a black-owned company. The successful on-time completion of the project brought positive attention to the company, including one writer's observation that \\"no racial friction occurred\\" in the work force of 1,600, of whom about three-fourths were black and one-fourth white. During the 1940s the firm also designed several public housing projects around the country, and Moses McKissack was appointed to President Franklin Roosevelt's White House Conference on Housing Problems. In 1942 the brothers were awarded the Spaulding Medal, recognizing the outstanding Negro business firm in the U.S. Moses McKissack III died on December 12, 1952; McKissack Middle School in Nashville was named in his honor in 1954. Calvin McKissack remained with the firm until his death in 1968. William DeBerry McKissack, the youngest son of Moses III, then succeeded his uncle as president of the firm. After suffering a stroke, he retired due to illness, and his wife, Leatrice Buchanan McKissack, became chief executive officer.Sources disagree on the date of his retirement. The AT&T; Tennessee African-American History Calendar gives it as 1975, while the National Visionary Leadership Project gives it as 1983. Under her leadership, the firm won major contracts for new buildings and renovations at the Fisk University, Tennessee State University and Meharry Medical College campuses in Nashville, as well as a $50 million renovation project for Howard University in Washington, D.C., and design of the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis. National expansion and move from Nashville McKissack & McKissack opened an office in Washington, D.C. in 1990, headed by Deryl McKissack, one of the three daughters of William and Leatrice McKissack.

It was originally formed in 2011 to develop a new air-launched space transportation system, with its corporate headquarters located in Seattle, Washington. The company and development project were officially announced in December 2011 by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Scaled Composites founder Burt Rutan, who had previously collaborated on the creation of SpaceShipOne. thumbupright=1.2Comparison between five of the largest aircraft: The project originally had three primary components: a carrier aircraft being built by Scaled Composites (called the Stratolaunch), a multi-stage payload launch vehicle which was to have been launched at high altitude into space from under the carrier aircraft, plus a mating and integration system by Dynetics. Ultimately, only the carrier aircraft was fully developed by the time of Paul Allen's death in late 2018. The carrier aircraft first flew in April 2019, at the Mojave Air and Space Port, reaching and 165 kn (305 km/h) in a 2 h 29 min flight. Stratolaunch underwent a change of ownership and major change of direction in mid-2019 as the assets of the company were put up for sale, and some sources suggested that Stratolaunch could cease operations completely. The new owner was identified in December 2019 to be Cerberus Capital Management. CEO Jean Floyd announced that Stratolaunch reacquired staff in the fourth quarter of 2019, growing to 87 employees by mid-December and forecasting a \\"great year\\" in 2020 providing high-speed flight test services. History The project was started in 2010, almost a year before the public announcement was made. Development costs were initially projected to be US$300 million in 2011. Dynetics actually began work in early 2010 and had approximately 40 employees working on the project . Dynetics was cited as \\"responsible for the total systems engineering, integration and testing, which includes aerodynamics, loads, and interfaces\\". It was announced in 2011 that SpaceX was also already working on the design for the rocket-powered space vehicle components of the system, the Falcon 9 Air. Stratolaunch logo from 2011‚Äì2019 The collaboration with SpaceX ended by 2012. In a 2015 interview, former president Chuck Beames (2014‚Äì2016) explained, \\"SpaceX was a partner, and like a lot of partnerships, it was just determined that it was best we went our separate ways ‚Äì different ambitions. We were interested in their engines, but Elon and his team, they're about going to Mars, and we're just in a different place, and so I think it was a parting of the ways that was amicable\\". Stratolaunch Systems completed its first composites production building in October 2012. In February 2013, the company completed construction of its carrier assembly hangar and operations facilities at the Mojave Air and Space Port. The carrier aircraft was originally projected to make its first test flight in 2015. By October 2013, the first flight of the carrier aircraft was pushed back until 2018 at the earliest, with the first flight of the air- launched rocket expected in 2019 at the earliest. In 2014, Stratolaunch announced that it was considering multiple launch vehicle options over a range of satellite sizes, and that some development work on the orbital launch vehicle has been slowed down to focus on completion of the carrier aircraft. In 2015, Stratolaunch Systems was placed under the supervision of Paul Allen's new aerospace company Vulcan Aerospace, a subsidiary of Vulcan Inc. Beames stated, \\"Vulcan Aerospace is the company within Vulcan that plans and executes projects to shift how the world conceptualizes space travel through cost reduction and on‚Äêdemand access. Vulcan Aerospace has its heritage in SpaceShipOne and oversees the Stratolaunch Systems project\\" Later in the year, in November 2015, Gary Wentz \\"stepped down as president and CEO of Stratolaunch Systems to join United Launch Alliance to lead human launch services\\" for ULA. Vulcan ended its contract with Orbital ATK in mid-2015 and indicated that a decision on a new rocket for the Stratolaunch Carrier Aircraft would be made in late 2015.Stratolaunch's Plans Up in the Air, Jeff Foust, SpaceNews, 18 November 2015, accessed 28 November 2015. In 2017, Fast Company named the Stratolaunch one of the world's most innovative companies citing the air-launch system's size and ability to fly in inclement weather. In April 2017, Stratolaunch formally transitioned its name from Vulcan Aerospace to Stratolaunch Systems Corporation. In May 2017, the Stratolaunch was rolled out for the first time to begin fueling tests, the first of many ground tests. In December 2017, the Stratolaunch was rolled out for the first taxi test on the runway at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California. In January 2019, Stratolaunch announced it was halting development of its own air-launched family of launch vehicles. This followed the death of Stratolaunch founder Paul Allen in October 2018, who had been the source of funds for the capital intensive development program since its founding in 2011. In April 2019, Jean Floyd remained CEO of Stratolaunch.Stratolaunch Aircraft First Flight Press Briefing, 13 April 2019, accessed 19 September 2019. On 31 May 2019, it was reported that the company would cease operations and that sale of its assets was being explored. In the event, the company remained in operation and posted job openings, including listings for test pilots, in September 2019. In October 2019, the company announced continuing regular operation and change of ownership, but did not disclose the identity of the new owner as Cerberus Capital Management, a specialist in the purchase of distressed companies, until December 2019. Stratolaunch began to rapidly reacquire staff in the fourth quarter of 2019, growing from just 13 employees in October 2019 to 87 employees by mid-December 2019. The company redirected its mission to providing high-speed flight test services. Carrier aircraft Allen and Rutan stated that Stratolaunch's carrier aircraft would have a wingspan of or about wider than the length of an Apollo-era Saturn V and about half as long as the Hindenburg class airships. This would make it the largest airplane, by wingspan, ever to fly. It will weigh in at over including the fully fueled launch vehicle and will require a runway at least long. It can carry over of payload. The carrier plane will be powered by six Pratt & Whitney PW4000, thrust-range jet engines, sourced from two used 747-400s that were cannibalized for engines, avionics, flight deck, landing gear and other proven systems to reduce initial development costs. The carrier is designed to have a range of when flying an air launch mission. In August 2015, Vulcan Aerospace then-president Chuck Beames said, \\"In 2016, I think, we'll have the aircraft flying... 80% is fabricated now... about 40% assembled... we should have final assembly done the end of this year or early next year. For the next few years, we'll do all of our test flights out of Mojave... There's already an air corridor that's established by the Air Force for this kind of stuff anyway, and we'll fly out over the Pacific\\". In the event, the first Stratolaunch carrier aircraft was not towed out of the Stratolaunch Mojave building to start ground testing until May 2017, at which time the company suggested they were planning for a first \\"launch demonstration\\" in 2019. Over the course of 2018, the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft performed taxi tests of increasing speed at the Mojave airport. On 9 January 2019, the Stratolaunch carrier aircraft completed a 110 knot () taxi test, and released an accompanying photo of the nose landing gear lifted off the ground during the test. The first successful flight test was performed on Saturday, 13 April 2019. The aircraft flew for 2.5 hours, achieving a speed of 304 km/h and altitudes up to . Launch vehicle Launch rocket Originally SpaceX was intended to provide a liquid-fueled rocket to serve as the means of lifting the Stratolaunch payload delivery vehicle into space by launching it at high altitude from under the carrier aircraft, but collaboration with SpaceX was abandoned in late 2012. In November 2012, Stratolaunch retained Orbital ATK on a \\"study contract\\" to develop and evaluate \\"several alternative configurations\\" for the vehicle to be launched from the carrier aircraft. By early 2013, Orbital ATK was under contract to develop the Pegasus II for the Stratolaunch space vehicle launch component: The Pegasus II was expected to be able to deliver up to to low Earth orbit. In May 2014, it was announced that the Pegasus II solid-fuel rocket was not achieving design economic goals and that Stratolaunch had contracted with Aerojet Rocketdyne to build the RL10C-1 dual-motor liquid fuel engines for the launch vehicle. In October 2016, it was announced that \\"multiple\\" Pegasus XL rockets would be used by Stratolaunch. It was announced, on 13 September 2017, that Stratolaunch had signed an agreement with NASA to providing testing services to support propulsion for a vehicle. It was noted that Stratolaunch hired Jeff Thornburg as vice president of propulsion. Thornberg had worked both on the J-2X engine for NASA and helped develop the Raptor rocket engine at SpaceX. The implication is Stratolaunch has decided to go its own way in developing a launch vehicle. The NASA agreement stated that Stratolaunch plans to deliver the test device for \\"testing of its propulsion system test article element 1\\" at NASA's Stennis E1 test stand by the end of May 2018. The test series is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018. On 2 November 2018, Stratolaunch completed the first hot-fire test of the \\"pre-burner\\" portion of its engine at NASA's Stennis Space Center. All Stratolaunch development work on its own family of launch vehicles ended in January 2019, but at that time, the company stated it continued to plan to launch the Pegasus XL rocket from the carrier aircraft.  Spaceplanes  =Crewed Dream Chaser study= Shortly after losing a NASA contract competition to SpaceX and Boeing in September 2014, Sierra Nevada Corporation announced it had conceptualized a launch system that combined a scaled-down version of the company's Dream Chaser space plane with the Stratolaunch Systems high altitude air-launch system. In November 2014, Vulcan Aerospace released the results of the SNC/Stratolaunch space transportation architecture, which indicated that a reduced-size Dream Chaser in conjunction with the Stratolaunch-based launch system could provide a number of unique mission capabilities. The proposed system concept would have an outbound range of away from the departure airport, which would allow launches to any given orbital plane for rendezvous with another object in low Earth orbit on a daily basis. The launch vehicle in the study was a modified air-launched Orbital ATK rocket that is approximately in length. The crewed space plane payload would be a 75% sized version of the Dream Chaser vehicle previously proposed to NASA ‚Äî while maintaining the relative outer mold line- in length with a wingspan of , which could carry 2 to 3 crewmembers plus a variety of scientific and research payloads. The concept did not advance into development and was never built. =Black Ice= An internal Stratolaunch concept, the Black Ice spaceplane was revealed in early 2018, as a possible payload for the Stratolaunch system. It would be a fully reusable rocketplane the size of the NASA Space Shuttle orbiter, and initially be robotic, with possible future crewed variant. It is currently in development. =Talon-A= Stratolaunch is developing a reusable, rocket-powered, hypersonic flight vehicle called Talon-A (formerly named Hyper-A testbed vehicle, as originally proposed in late 2018) that would be capable of flying at speeds of . , the vehicle is planned to go into operation in 2022. The aircraft is in length, with a wingspan of , and is intended to have a launch mass of approximately . The company reportedly has sufficient funding in place to complete early development through the first hypersonic test flight. Stratolaunch also has a concept in place, , for a much larger Talon-Z that would be capable of carrying cargo payloads, and perhaps people as well, to orbit. Facilities In 2011, Stratolaunch Systems signed a 20-year lease agreement with the Kern County Airport Authority, Mojave, California, for the lease of at the Mojave Air and Space Port to build production and launch facilities. By 2015, Stratolaunch had built a fabrication hangar and a assembly hangar located near Scaled Composites. The first of two manufacturing buildings, the \\"88,000 square foot facility [to] be used to construct the composite sections of the wing and fuselage sections\\", was opened for production in October 2012, two months ahead of schedule and on budget. Stratolaunch completed their second Mojave building, the very large hangar facility for the Stratolaunch Carrier Aircraft, in February 2013. On 31 May 2017, the first Stratolaunch carrier aircraft was towed from the Stratolaunch Mojave hangar to begin ground testing. By late 2017, the plan was to have the first rocket air launch in 2019. This was not achieved.

Biography Vivian Stannett with his wife, Flora Susanne Sulzbacher Vivian Stannett receiving an award Early life Vivian was born on September 1, 1917 in Langley, England, to Ernest and Dorothy Grace (Rustell) Stannett. He was raised in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, England. His father was a dairy farmer and the proprietor of Berry Farm, Vivian's childhood home. Vivian showed interest in chemistry at an early age and conducted experiments in an abandoned railway car on the family property. World War II In 1936, Vivian enrolled in London Polytechnic to study chemistry and graduated with a B.S. in 1939. Afterwards, from 1939-1947, he worked for the British government at a cellulose-acetate film plant of the British Celansese Corporation whose products had military applications such as gas masks. In 1941, he was moved to Woolwich Arsenal where he worked on detonator inspection and research at the army laboratories. The arsenal lab was damaged by bombs and eventually destroyed by a V-2 rocket; Vivian was transferred to Liverpool, the site of a large ordnance plant and laboratories. On May 30, 1946, Vivian married Flora Susanne Sulzbacher of Nuremberg, Germany who graduated with a degree in textile chemistry from Queen's University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Professional life After World War II, Vivian began his graduate studies in 1947 under Professor Herman Francis Mark at the Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn (now Polytechnic Institute of New York University). Three years later, in 1950, he received his Ph.D. in physical chemistry. In 1951, Vivian became a research associate at the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and accepted a position as a research chemist at Koppers. His United States citizenship was granted in 1957. In 1952, Vivian accepted a position at the College of Forestry in Syracuse, New York as an assistant professor in forest chemistry. In 1957, he became a full professor. In 1958, during a sabbatical, he partnered with Professors Adolphe Chapiro and Michel Magat at the University of Paris who worked in the field radiation grafting and radiation chemistry of polymers. In 1961, Vivian was appointed to associate director of the Camille- Dreyfus Laboratory for Polymer Research, established by a grant from the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, at the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina. There, he became an adjunct professor of chemistry at Duke University and North Carolina State University. In 1967 he became a full-time professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at NCSU and later became named Camille Dreyfus Professor. Vivian served as vice provost and dean of NCSU's Graduate School from 1975-1982 and helped establish the nation's first doctoral program in textile chemistry. From 1982-1984 he worked in London as Liaison Scientist for the Office of Naval Research, Europe.

He was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent in 2011. He played college football at Southern Arkansas University. Early years Thornton attended Star City High School, where he practiced football, baseball and basketball. In football, he played as a running back and wide receiver. Thornton walked on to Division II Southern Arkansas University to join his brother. He was converted into a defensive end and became a starter as a junior, recording 80 tackles (first on the team), 23 tackles for loss (ranked first in college football), 8.5 sacks, 2 forced fumbles and 2 blocked kicks. The next year, he had 52 tackles (third on the team), 13 tackles for loss, 1.5 sacks, 5 quarterback hurries (led the team) and one forced fumble. Professional career Philadelphia Eagles Thornton signed by the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent following the 2011 NFL Draft and NFL lockout. He initially made the 53-man roster after training camp to open the season, but was waived to make room for offensive lineman Kyle DeVan on September 4. He was re-signed to the team's practice squad the next day, where he spent the first thirteen weeks of the season. On December 12, he was promoted to the active roster and was declared inactive for the last three games. In 2012, Thornton's playing time increased as a backup on the defensive line rotation, while registering 47 tackles, 2 tackles for loss and one sack. His best game came against the Atlanta Falcons, when he had 8 tackles and one sack. In 2013, he became the starting defensive end in the Eagles 3-4 defense, posting 78 tackles, 5 tackles for loss (third on the team) and one sack. The next year, he missed 3 games with a hand injury, but still had 61 tackles, 3 tackles for loss, one sack and 3 fumble recoveries. Dallas Cowboys On March 10, 2016, Thornton signed a four-year contract with the Dallas Cowboys worth more than $18 million and $6 million guaranteed, with the intention of moving him from defensive end to defensive tackle. His season was seen as something of a disappointment, because he couldn't supplant Terrell McClain or rookie Maliek Collins in the starting lineup and was relegated to a backup role as part of the defensive tackle rotation. He missed the last 3 games against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Detroit Lions and Philadelphia Eagles with a high ankle sprain. He finished with 22 tackles, 1.5 sacks, one forced fumble and a fumble recovery. After undergoing offseason shoulder surgery, he entered the 2017 organized team activities as the leading candidate to replace McClain, who had left in free agency. He injured his hamstring after being off to a good start, which forced him to miss several weeks of training camp. He was eventually passed on the depth chart by free agent acquisition Stephen Paea. Although his $3 million base salary was guaranteed for the season, the Cowboys released him on September 3, after claiming defensive tackle Brian Price off waivers. Buffalo Bills On September 5, 2017, Thornton signed with the Buffalo Bills. He appeared in 15 games with 3 starts. San Francisco 49ers On July 25, 2018, Thornton signed with the San Francisco 49ers. On August 22, 2018, Thornton announced his retirement from the NFL after six seasons. On April 15, 2019, Thornton came out of retirement after sitting out 2018, and was added to the 49ers active roster. He was released on July 26, 2019.

Their visual identities therefore have been a result of this aim. BBC Knowledge Ladders of Learning (1999‚Äì2000) A ladders of learning ident BBC Knowledge was launched on 1 June 1999 with the intent of creating a multimedia learning channel. The idea was that computers, interactive TV via the Red Button and television could come together to make a new, factual, learning channel for kids and adults alike. The launch identity consisted of cartoon characters climbing 'ladders of learning' between clouds against an orange background. All the idents featured the station logo, which followed the BBC style design of the time by having the station name follow the BBC logo in upper case. This white logo would appear at the end of ident. The idents all featured characters, drawn by Michael Sheehy, shown with items such as a magnifying glass, telescope or rolls of paper. Several variations of the ident were made featuring different characters prominent on the ladders of learning. The ident was also used as the background to programme menus with characters seen climbing the ladders of learning in the background with programme information overlaid and centred to accommodate widescreen. These characters could also been seen as stills on launch promotional material and on the BBC Knowledge website. The channel launched with a Digital on-screen graphic (DOG), in line with the BBC practice at the time. However, different from the other channels which used the station logo, BBC Knowledge used the URL of their website 'www.bbc.co.uk/knowledge'. The use of this promoted the website tie in with the channel. The channel also used credit promotions where additional content or information is promoted over a programmes end credits, by reducing the credits to a smaller size and filling the information in the remaining space. Another style of presentation utilised was that of viewer videos, shown either as part of the shrinking credits, or between programmes. The presentation for the channel as a whole was in 16:9 widescreen from launch, however all information was kept in a 4:3 safe area, so no information was lost to viewers watching on a 'full screen' television. Information included the logo, promotions and the DOG. Circles (2000‚Äì2002) In December 2000, following the approval of the new BBC Four, BBC Knowledge's programming was realigned to better reflect the new channel. A single ident was utilised instead featuring a circle made out of different materials which would move forward and off the screen at the viewer. These could be made with a variety of objects. The musical accompaniment followed the choral and instrumental style. This sequence lasted until the station went off air. Promotional style remained the same with the BBC Knowledge logo seen at the bottom. The DOG also changed to the BBC Knowledge logo. Stranded idents The channel had always utilised a stranded layout to make genres of programmes easy to find on the new channel. However, special idents began to appear for each strand from c.2000. These featured an object, before a fact about it related to the strand appears and ends on an image with the strand name shown clearly on screen, with a letter encircled at the centre of the screen. It is unclear whether these idents were replacements of the normal idents, or complementary to them, however it appears they complemented them, with these idents being used in the stranded sections, with the animated idents used for general interest programming. Following the relaunch in 2000 and 2001, all different idents were dropped in favour of a single ident, featuring numerous circles made out of different structures reflecting the new strands. BBC Four Improvised (2002‚Äì2005) One of the improvised idents, used between 2002 and 2005 The BBC's \\"cultural\\" channel BBC Four was launched on 2 March 2002 as a successor to BBC Knowledge. As a result, the channel was to show a broad variety of programming. To show this, Lambie Nairn devised the idea of an improvised ident that reacted to the frequencies of continuity announcers' voices or the background music of the ident. Contains videos of the idents. As a result, no idents were ever the same, however variations were produced featuring different visualisations, such as semicircles, vibrating lines or shafts extending from the bottom surface. The channel logo featured the new style of logo with the channel name 'Four' located in upper case inside a black box with the BBC logo above it. This logo was present in the bottom right corner of idents and promotions for the entire duration. The launch slogan of the channel 'Everybody needs a place to think' was present on all launch promotions. Promotional style featured the BBC Four logo present throughout the promotion with the details appearing in white in the top right corner of the screen, aligned right. If the background image was too light, a translucent black box was placed over the top third of the screen. The channel also used a DOG, however this was not the new logo, but a one line style used by the previous channel with the BBC logo and 'FOUR' to the right of it in the same size. Four sections (2005‚Äìpresent) Swimming Pool ident introduced in 2005 (retired in 2016) BBC Four's identity changed on 10 September 2005. These new idents, designed by Red Bee Media, featured an image made up of four parts but undistinguishable until something interacts within the scene. Idents included: *Seagulls: Seagulls which fly between the pictures, often getting closer or further away than previous. (retired in 2016) *Library: A girl climbs a ladder against a bookcase. As the ladder is moved, the ladder section in a different segment moves differently. Equally the girl may climb off the bottom of the screen to reappear at the top. In addition, whenever she replaced a book, another fell out in a different segment. Used from September 2005 to 2016, but later it returned in May 2020 *Lake: A mountain scene against a lake where a drop of water causes ripples in more than one segment, before a drop rises from the sky/lake in another segment. Used since September 2005 *Swimming Pool: A child in a swimming pool swimming with a ring. The views are from different angles, for example looking down from the air and underwater looking up at the surface. (retired in 2016) *Flowers: Bees collecting nectar that appear elsewhere when flying across borders. Used since September 2005 *Office: Staff are seen having an argument in an office; as an employee leaves one quarter of the screen, they appear in another section. (retired in 2016) These are the some of the idents that were launched since 2016 which it was used to introduce special programming: *Cherry Blossom: Initially used during \\"Japan Season\\" and \\"Inner Peace\\", both in 2017. Now already in use as a regular ident.https://theident.gallery/play.php?id=BBC4-2017-ID-CHERRYBLOSSOM-1.mp4 *Home: Shows a rooftop of a house which it is divided into four when it was zoomed out. Initially used for the \\"Homes Season\\" in May 2016, but later used as a regular ident.https://theident.gallery/play.php?id=BBC4-2016-ID- HOMES-1.mp4 *Space: Shows the BBC Four logo steady & the background spinning in the outer space.

Used since April 2017.https://theident.gallery/play.php?id=BBC4-2017-ID- TELEVISION-1.mp4 *Born Digital: Used to introduce programs related to the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web from March 2019. There are 5 idents that are currently on air. *Saturday Night Drama: Currently used to introduce dramas on Saturday nights from 6 April 2019. The black box logo was retained from the previous look but moved to the centre of the screen to divide the four segments. Promotional style also changed. The BBC Four logo would remain in the bottom corner of the screen throughout the promotion, but would be overlaid by the programme information in an opaque coloured box in the lower right segment of the screen, with the BBC Four logo in the centre. This was altered in 2008 to a BBC Four box appears in the middle of the screen from which the video is wiped out anticlockwise round the logo from the right revealing the programme information to the right of the logo. In July 2013, they updated trailer graphics. This includes centralizing the channel logo unifying trailer styles from BBC One and BBC Two. In February 2018, the channel updated its trailer graphics and holding animation shown during the channel's downtime hours. BBC Four is the first channel to use the new corporate font of the BBC, which is the BBC Reith. The DOG for the channel remained the same in the 4:3 screen size safe zone; this was only changed in 2011 when it was switched to widescreen 16:9. As of 2020, these idents have had the longest lifespan of any on a BBC channel.

Preliminary scattering theory  The following description follows the canonical way of introducing elementary scattering theory. A steady beam of particles scatters off a spherically symmetric potential V(r), which is short ranged so that for large distances r\\\\to\\\\infty, the particles behave like free particles. In principle, any particle should be described by a wave packet but we describe the scattering of a plane wave traveling along the z-axis \\\\exp(ikz) instead, because wave packets are expanded in terms of plane waves and this is mathematically simpler. Because the beam is switched on for times long compared to the time of interaction of the particles with the scattering potential, a steady state is assumed. This means that the stationary Schr√∂dinger equation for the wave function \\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf r) representing the particle beam should be solved: :\\\\left[-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2 + V(r)\\\\right]\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf r) = E\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf r) We make the following ansatz: :\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf r) = \\\\Psi_0(\\\\mathbf r) + \\\\Psi_{\\\\mathrm{s}}(\\\\mathbf r) where \\\\Psi_0(\\\\mathbf r) \\\\propto \\\\exp(ikz) is the incoming plane wave and \\\\Psi_{\\\\mathrm{s}}(\\\\mathbf r) is a scattered part perturbing the original wave function. It is the asymptotic form of \\\\Psi_{\\\\mathrm{s}}(\\\\mathbf r) that is of interest, because observations near the scattering center (e.g. an atomic nucleus) are mostly not feasible and detection of particles takes place far away from the origin. At large distances, the particles should behave like free particles and \\\\Psi_{\\\\mathrm{s}}(\\\\mathbf r) should therefore be a solution to the free Schr√∂dinger equation. This suggests that it should have a similar form to a plane wave, omitting any physically meaningless parts. We therefore investigate the plane wave expansion: :e^{i k z} = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell = 0}^\\\\infty (2 \\\\ell + 1) i^\\\\ell j_\\\\ell(k r) P_\\\\ell(\\\\cos \\\\theta). The spherical Bessel function j_\\\\ell(kr) asymptotically behaves like : j_\\\\ell(kr) \\\\to \\\\frac 1 {2ikr} \\\\left(\\\\exp(i(kr-l\\\\pi/2)) - \\\\exp(-i(kr-l\\\\pi/2))\\\\right). This corresponds to an outgoing and an incoming spherical wave. For the scattered wave function, only outgoing parts are expected. We therefore expect \\\\Psi_{\\\\mathrm{s}}(\\\\mathbf r)\\\\propto \\\\exp(ikr) / r at large distances and set the asymptotic form of the scattered wave to :\\\\Psi_{\\\\mathrm{s}}(\\\\mathbf r)\\\\to f(\\\\theta, k)\\\\frac{\\\\exp(ikr)}{r} where f(\\\\theta, k) is the so-called scattering amplitude, which is in this case only dependent on the elevation angle \\\\theta and the energy. In conclusion, this gives the following asymptotic expression for the entire wave function: :\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf r)\\\\to \\\\Psi^{(+)}(\\\\mathbf r) = \\\\exp(ikz) + f(\\\\theta, k)\\\\frac{\\\\exp(ikr)}{r}.  Partial wave expansion  In case of a spherically symmetric potential V(\\\\mathbf r) = V(r), the scattering wave function may be expanded in spherical harmonics which reduce to Legendre polynomials because of azimuthal symmetry (no dependence on \\\\phi): :\\\\Psi(\\\\mathbf r) = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{u_\\\\ell(r)}{r}P_\\\\ell(\\\\cos\\\\theta). In the standard scattering problem, the incoming beam is assumed to take the form of a plane wave of wave number , which can be decomposed into partial waves using the plane wave expansion in terms of spherical Bessel functions and Legendre polynomials: :\\\\psi_{\\\\text{in}}(\\\\mathbf r) = e^{i k z} = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell = 0}^\\\\infty (2 \\\\ell + 1) i^\\\\ell j_\\\\ell(k r) P_\\\\ell(\\\\cos \\\\theta) Here, we have assumed a spherical coordinate system in which the -axis is aligned with the beam direction. The radial part of this wave function consists solely of the spherical Bessel function, which can be rewritten as a sum of two spherical Hankel functions: :j_\\\\ell(k r) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(h_\\\\ell^{(1)}(k r) + h_\\\\ell^{(2)}(k r)\\\\right) This has physical significance: asymptotically (i.e. for large ) behaves as and is thus an outgoing wave, whereas asymptotically behaves as and is thus an incoming wave. The incoming wave is unaffected by the scattering, while the outgoing wave is modified by a factor known as the partial wave S-matrix element : :\\\\frac{u_\\\\ell(r)}{r} \\\\stackrel{r \\\\to \\\\infty}{\\\\longrightarrow} \\\\frac{i^\\\\ell k}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi}} \\\\left(h_\\\\ell^{(1)}(k r) + S_\\\\ell h_\\\\ell^{(2)}(k r)\\\\right) where is the radial component of the actual wave function. The scattering phase shift is defined as half of the phase of : :S_\\\\ell = e^{2 i \\\\delta_\\\\ell} If flux is not lost, then and thus the phase shift is real. This is typically the case unless the potential has an imaginary absorptive component, which is often used in phenomenological models to simulate loss due to other reaction channels. Therefore, the full wave function is, asymptotically, :\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf r) \\\\stackrel{r \\\\to \\\\infty}{\\\\longrightarrow} \\\\sum_{\\\\ell = 0}^\\\\infty (2 \\\\ell + 1) i^\\\\ell \\\\frac{h_\\\\ell^{(1)}(k r) + S_\\\\ell h_\\\\ell^{(2)}(k r)}{2} P_\\\\ell(\\\\cos \\\\theta) Subtracting yields the asymptotic outgoing wave function: :\\\\psi_{\\\\text{out}}(\\\\mathbf r) \\\\stackrel{r \\\\to \\\\infty}{\\\\longrightarrow} \\\\sum_{\\\\ell = 0}^\\\\infty (2 \\\\ell + 1) i^\\\\ell \\\\frac{S_\\\\ell - 1}{2} h_\\\\ell^{(2)}(k r) P_\\\\ell(\\\\cos \\\\theta) Making use of the asymptotic behavior of the spherical Hankel functions, one obtains: :\\\\psi_{\\\\text{out}}(\\\\mathbf r) \\\\stackrel{r \\\\to \\\\infty}{\\\\longrightarrow} \\\\frac{e^{i k r}}{r} \\\\sum_{\\\\ell = 0}^\\\\infty (2 \\\\ell + 1) \\\\frac{S_\\\\ell - 1}{2 i k} P_\\\\ell(\\\\cos \\\\theta) Since the scattering amplitude is defined via: :\\\\psi_{\\\\text{out}}(\\\\mathbf r) \\\\stackrel{r \\\\to \\\\infty}{\\\\longrightarrow} \\\\frac{e^{i k r}}{r} f(\\\\theta, k) It follows that :f(\\\\theta, k) = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell = 0}^\\\\infty (2 \\\\ell + 1) \\\\frac{S_\\\\ell - 1}{2 i k} P_\\\\ell(\\\\cos \\\\theta) = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell = 0}^\\\\infty (2 \\\\ell + 1) \\\\frac{e^{i \\\\delta_\\\\ell} \\\\sin\\\\delta_\\\\ell}{k} P_\\\\ell(\\\\cos \\\\theta) and thus the differential cross section is given by :\\\\frac{d\\\\sigma}{d\\\\Omega} = f(\\\\theta, k)^2 = \\\\frac{1}{k^2} \\\\left \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^\\\\infty (2\\\\ell+1) e^{i\\\\delta_\\\\ell} \\\\sin \\\\delta_\\\\ell P_\\\\ell(\\\\cos \\\\theta) \\\\right^2 This works for any short-ranged interaction. For long-ranged interactions (such as the Coulomb interaction), the summation over may not converge. The general approach for such problems consist in treating the Coulomb interaction separately from the short-ranged interaction, as the Coulomb problem can be solved exactly in terms of Coulomb functions, which take on the role of the Hankel functions in this problem.

It belongs to the Acer section Parviflora. Description and range Acer nipponicum is a medium-sized deciduous tree, growing to between Oregon State University Department of Horticulture accessed 12 December 2011 and averaging tall. The branches and trunk have a smooth grey bark, while young twigs are a smooth, slightly lustrous dark green. The flowers of A. nipponicum are generally andromonoecious, but some trees in groves occasionally are androecious, having only male flowers. Wild specimens flower from about Late June and continue through late July depending on elevation, with trees growing at lower elevation starting to bloom in mid June, and some trees flowering through to early August. The species is found in mountainous regions on the islands of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu in Japan at elevations ranging from . The northernmost groves are near Mount Hachimantai and Mount Iwate in Iwate Prefecture on Honshu. The southernmost groves are in the southeast corner of Kumamoto Prefecture on Kyushu. Classification A ribosomal DNA study of Acer species in 2006 placed A. nipponicum along with the related A.caudatum near the base of the phylogenetic trees recovered. A. nipponicum is suggested to be closely related to two of the extinct species of Acer placed in the section Parviflora by paleobotanists Jack Wolfe and Toshimasa Tanai. The species A. browni and A. smileyi were both described by Wolfe and Tanai in 1987 from groups of fossils found in western North America. The slightly older species A. smileyi is suggested by Wolfe and Tanai to have been closer in relation to A. nipponicum than A. browni based on the leaf morphology. History The species was first described by Adrien Ren√© Franchet and Paul Amed√©e Ludovic Savatier as Acer parviflorum in 1877. This name was already taken, having been used in the earlier description of Acer parviflorum by Jakob Friedrich Ehrhart, which in turn is a synonym of Acer spicatum. Noting this situation, in 1938 Hermann Albrecht Hesse renamed the species to Acer brevilobum, but because this renaming was published thirteen days after Hiroshi Hara published his renaming of the species to Acer nipponicum, the A. nipponicum name has priority.

She was one of the founders of modern nursing with Florence Nightingale. Mikhailova was born in a village near Klyuchischi in the Kazan Governorate. Her father, a sailor in the Russian navy, was killed in the Battle of Sinope in 1853. She was a 17-year-old orphan when the Crimean War broke out in 1853. Before the war, she worked as a laundress and needlewoman for the personnel of the Russian navy in the Korabelnaya district of Sevastopol, near Sevastopol Shipyard. She left her home when the war broke out to help take care of wounded Russian soldiers on the battlefield during the Battle of Alma. She set up a nursing station, using vinegar and strips of her clothing to clean and dress the soldiers' wounds. She was the first Russian army sisters of charity during the Crimean War.

She was also given a reward of 500 silver rubles, and promised a further gift of 1,000 silver rubles on her marriage, when she married, which she received when she married Private Maksim Khvorostov in 1855. The couple ran an inn in a village, then moved to Nikolaev, but Dasha eventually returned to Sevastopol where she ran a tavern and worked in a hospital. When she retired, she was presented with an icon of Christ bought with donations from her patients. She died in Shelanga, near her home village, in 1892.

The game is a parody of the scandal surrounding the Spycatcher book. Gameplay Acorn Electron screenshot showing the opening screen in Blackhall (the game's version of Whitehall) Spycat is loosely based on the then current scandal surrounding the release of Spycatcher, the memoirs of former MI5 officer and Assistant Director Peter Wright. The player takes the role of the Spycat, Peter Correct, who has worked for M.I.4 for fifty years but finds out he is to be forced to retire with a low pension. The player must collect classified research documents (among other items), then flee to Greenland to write his memoirs. Other characters found in the game include Sir Clive Amstrad (an amalgamation of Clive Sinclair and Alan Sugar) as technical expert \\"Q\\" and the Prime Minister Margo Thatch (Margaret Thatcher).Original instructions, Superior Software The game takes the form of an arcade adventure with the player moving through a series of locations and rooms, collecting and using items to progress. The player must avoid CCTV cameras and \\"Q\\"'s electronic devices that will drain Spycat's energy.

Baker, produced and distributed by Goldwyn Pictures. It was based on the novel La Peau de chagrin by Honor√© de Balzac, first published in 1831. The Balzac novel had previously been filmed in 1909 as The Wild Ass's Skin, which was more faithful to the original novel. The picture stars George Walsh, Bessie Love, and Carmel Myers. A print of the film is preserved in the collection of Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise.  Plot  In Paris, when failed poet Raphael, Marquis de Valentin (Walsh) meets the glamorous Countess Fedora (Myers), who promotes Raphael as a poet. He falls in love with her, but she rejects him. When he is about to commit suicide by jumping into the Seine, Raphael enters an antique shop where he gets a magic piece of leather that can grant wishes. As it grants wishes, the leather becomes smaller. Raphael selfishly uses the wishes for himself, but uses the final wish benevolently, which enables him to be reunited with his true love, Pauline (Love). Countess Fedora is buried under an avalanche.  Cast   Reception  The film received mixed reviews, with many reviewers noted the fanciful plot and subject matter as a hindrance to the film's success. Carmel Myers's performance was especially highly praised, as were the visuals, especially Myers's wardrobe.

The species is known from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene sediments exposed in the states of Alaska, Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon, USA. It is one of several extinct species placed in the living section Parviflora. History and classification The eight leaf specimens used to describe Acer smileyi were recovered from six different sites. The oldest group of specimens was recovered from the late Oligocene age Kukak Bay flora exposed on the Katmai National Park and Preserve along the Shelikof Strait in Alaska. Another paratype leaf was recovered from outcrops of the Langhian age Capps Glacier flora northwest of Kukak Bay in Kenai Peninsula County. A younger paratype of Middle Miocene age was recovered from the Trout Creek Formation in Harney County of southeastern Oregon. The southernmost occurrence of the species is at 49 camp in northwestern Washoe County, Nevada where the Burdigalian Upper Cedarville Formation is exposed. The youngest and easternmost of the known occurrences is near Clarkia, Idaho, where sediments of the Langhian age Lake Clarkia is exposed. One additional Langhian paratype is known from the Moose Mountain Flora, formerly known as the Cascadia flora exposed near the former town of Cascadia in western Oregon. In addition to the leaf specimens a series of paratype specimens were described for the associated samaras recovered at the Clarkia site and the '49 camp site. The type specimens for Acer smileyi are placed into three different repositories. The holotype leaf, three of the paratype leaves and all five of the paratype samaras are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed at the University of California Museum of Paleontology, in Berkeley, California. Two other paratype leaves are housed in the National Museum of Natural History, Washington, a part of the Smithsonian, while the last paratype leaf is part of the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology collections in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. smileyi in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name smileyi is in recognition of Charles J. Smiley for his extensive efforts studying the Clarkia sites and their flora. Description Leaves of Acer smileyi are simple in structure, with perfectly actinodromus vein structure and are generally orbiculate to suborbiculate in shape. The leaves are five-lobed with the basal two lobes small while the upper lateral lobes are almost as long as the median lobe and all lobes being triangular in outline. The leaves have five primary veins and range between long by wide in overall dimensions. A. smileyi has small teeth while the lobes have a distinct and complex bracing of veins formed by the joining of two external secondary veins. The combination of morphological features is not found in any modern species besides A. nipponicum and so A. smileyi, along with the extinct A. browni, is placed into the section Parviflora. The samaras of A. smileyi have a notably inflated nutlet and acutely diverging veins which rarely reconnect (anastomise). The overall shape of the nutlet is circular to elliptic with the average length of the samara up to and a wing width of . The paired samaras of the species have a 25¬∞ to 30¬∞ attachment angle and the distal region of the nutlet and wing forming distinct u-shaped shallow sulcus. A. smileyi is similar to A. browni but the two can be distinguished from each other by the size of the basal lobes which are larger in A. smileyi. The more attenuated teeth of A. smileyi are very similar in morphology to A. nipponicum indicating the two to be closer in relation to each other than to A. browi.

Locata has invented a local positioning system that can either replace or augment Global Positioning System (GPS) signals when they are blocked, jammed or unreliable. Government, commercial and other organizations use Locata to determine accurate positioning as a local backup to GPS. History David Small and Nunzio Gambale started work on the initial Locata concepts in 1994 and founded Locata as a company in 1997. As of December 2013, the company has been granted 122 patents around their positioning technology. Products LocataNet A LocataNet is a ground-based local positioning system that provides positioning information which is indistinguishable from GPS to an appropriately configured receiver. Inside GNSS The LocataNet achieves this without the satellites, atomic clocks or ground support structure required by traditional GPS satellite-based systems. To create a LocataNet, LocataLite radio transceivers are deployed around a defined area. These devices collectively function like MIT Technology Review a grounded version of a GPS satellite constellation, transmitting radiolocation signals that Locata receivers use to generate a positioning solution, outputting latitude, longitude and altitude, using trilateration in the same way as a traditional GPS receiver. LocataLites can be designed to transmit at any practical frequency or power level. The first commercially deployed designs operate in the same ISM band as Wi-Fi, and each LocataLite generally covers an area of up to 10 kilometers in radius in open environments. LocataNets provide all of the Position, Navigation and Time (PNT) functions provided by a GPS satellite constellation, but in a local area, such as an open-cut mine, harbor, military range or other area. This allows operators to set up controlled positioning networks to locate, automate and direct objects with centimeter-level accuracy. GPS World Locata‚Äôs duplication of PNT is made possible by the company's patented nanosecond-accurate TimeLoc synchronization technology. Inside GNSS VRay The VRay is an 80-element spherical antenna that provides precise positioning in dense urban environments and indoors where traditional GNSS receivers are susceptible to large multipath errors. MIT Technology Review By switching on each element for just over one microsecond, the VRay correlator design in a Locata receiver creates virtual beams which mitigate multipath effects by focusing on the direct received signal and filtering out multipath bounces. Because the VRay can sweep many beams simultaneously around an area it also determines the angle and strength of received signals and this information is used to derive the precise 3D attitude of the receiver platform as well. In a partnership with the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), the VRay is being developed for use with GPS receivers as part of a Co-operative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) signed in April 2013. GPS World AFIT will design and test several GPS-based variants of Locata- patented antenna and correlator technology to develop the VRay for military GPS use cases. Spatial Source Partners Hexagon, provider of design, measurement and visualization technologies, is the first company to integrate Locata's terrestrial technology within their Leica Geosystems subsidiary's GPS-GLONASS-Galileo-BeiDou receivers. American Surveyor Deployments Military Locata has been awarded a multi-year sole-source contract Inside GNSS with the United States Air Force 746th Test Squadron (746 TS) to deploy a LocataNet and provide positioning information when GPS is jammed across a 2,500 square mile area of the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. TMC Design, a certified Locata Technology Integrator (LTI) has been let the contract to design, integrate, install and test Locata‚Äôs Non-GPS Based Positioning System (NGBPS) at the White Sands Missile Range location. The Wall Street Journal Before the contract was granted, the USAF proved through independent testing that the LocataNet delivers accuracy of eight inches or less to aircraft up to 35 miles away. New Scientist Locata's NGBPS system will provide the 746 TS with enhanced validation capabilities in GPS denied environments while operating mobile and airborne position, navigation and timing (PNT) equipment and navigation warfare (NAVWAR) systems. Airforce Technology Locata is the core component for the USAF's Ultra High Accuracy Reference System (UHARS) which will be deployed at White Sands in 2014 to improve performance of military systems in GPS-denied environments. UHARS is described by the USAF as the new \\"gold standard truth system for the increasingly demanding test and evaluation of future navigation and navigation warfare systems for the U.S. Department of Defense\\". Inside GNSS Mining In partnership with Leica Geosystems, the first commercial LocataNet is deployed at Newmont‚Äôs Boddington Gold Mine (BGM) in Western Australia. MIT Technology Review In this environment, Locata‚Äôs technology provides positioning for automation of mining machines as the pit gets deeper and traditional satellite-based GPS coverage becomes unreliable because fewer satellites are in view in the pit, particularly near the mine‚Äôs pit walls. Automotive The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), in partnership with Perrone Robotics, GPS World in December 2013 completed the installation of phase 1 of a two-stage Locata network as the first portion of a $30 million upgrade to the Vehicle Research Center (VRC). Locata is the sole-source of positioning information for the precision robotics control required by the VRC for the U.S. testing of next-generation vehicle collision avoidance systems. Inside GNSS As part of the upgrade, VRC researchers are installing new robotic and high-precision positioning technology for both their outdoor track and 300-by-700 foot indoor testing area.

Early years Heschong was born in Cincinnati in 1919. His father, Albert Heschong, designed and made clothing. As a boy, he enjoyed building model boats and airplanes, drawing, and building things with Erector Sets. He attended Walnut Hills High School in Cincinnati, graduated cum laude, and was voted \\"most all-around boy in the class.\\" He was also in drama club, where he both acted and designed sets. After graduating high school, his high school drama teacher contacted the drama department at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Institute of Technology and secured a scholarship for Heschong. In the second half of his sophomore year, he transferred to the architecture department to develop his technical drawing skills. He left Carnegie Tech after two years to work at a playhouse in Chautauqua, New York. He next worked for a year at a theatrical company in Cincinnati and then for the Baltimore Museum of Art, where he designed and built sets and exhibits. During World War II, he was drafted into the United States Army. He was assigned to a camouflage design unit at Richmond Air Force Base, where he worked with Broadway designer Jo Mielziner. He was later assigned to interpret aerial reconnaissance photographs. He spent 18 months in India, supervising photographic reconnaissance in the China Burma India Theater. After the war, Heschong returned to Carnegie Tech to finish his degree. He was then hired to assist in teaching scenic design at Carnegie Tech. He also did design work for stage productions, including scenic design for The Woodstock Playhouse. Television career ABC In 1949, he was hired by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) as an art director. His early works included futuristic settings for ABC's Buck Rogers television show, including the interior of Buck Rogers' spaceship and the use of sparkler for the blastoff of rockets. In 1950, he was assigned to create all the settings for ABC's live drama Pulitzer Prize Playhouse. For the first episode, You Can't Take It with You, he built a large Victorian house set for $15,000.Television Academy interview, tape 2. While at ABC, he also worked with Alex Segal on the live drama series Celanese Theatre, including productions of Abe Lincoln in Illinois (1950) with Raymond Burr, Winterset (1951) with Burgess Meredith, Ah Wilderness (1951), Anna Christie (1952), and The Street Scene (1952). In the early 1950s, the ABC art department in New York worked out of a building that had previously been horse stables. They built sets using quarter-inch plywood on one-by-three framing. United States Steel Hour In 1954, he began working on the United States Steel Hour, which aired on NBC. His work at the Steel Hour included P.O.W. (1953), The Last Notch (1954), Hedda Gabler (1954), A Garden in the Sea (1954), No Time for Sergeants (1955), and Freighter (1955). No Time for Sergeants featured highly stylized sets and was the first dramatic show that was aired with an audience. For The Last Notch, the first Western done for television, he designed an entire Western street scene.Television Academy interview, tape 3. For A Garden in the Sea, he designed a villa in Venice, including a gondola approaching the villa.Television Academy interview, tape 4. First stint at CBS In the fall of 1955, he moved to Los Angeles to work for CBS. His first series for CBS was Climax! with Martin Manulis. His work for Climax! included Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1955) and The Circular Staircase (1956). Heschong also worked on the Meet Millie sitcom, the Red Skelton Hour, and an early-summer replacement show starring Johnny Carson. On the Skelton show, he was asked to design numerous trick shots. When Manulis left Climax! in 1956, Heschong followed him to Playhouse 90. Heschong won an Emmy Award for his art direction on the Rod Serling boxing drama Requiem for a Heavyweight (1956). For Requiem, his notable designs included sets at the boxing venue and a railroad car. Heschong's other notable Playhouse 90 productions included The Miracle Worker (1957), Helen Morgan (1957), Seven Against the Wall (1958), The Velvet Alley (1959), and Judgment at Nuremberg (1959). He designed the courtroom for Judgment at Nuremberg. 20th Century Fox In 1959, he was hired by 20th Century Fox to work on the series Adventures in Paradise, a South Pacific adventure series created by James Michener. He did not stay at Fox for very long. Return to CBS Have Gun, Will Travel Cara Williams The Wild, Wild West After leaving Fox, he returned to CBS and worked on the sitcom Pete and Gladys, the Western Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel, and later another sitcom The Cara Williams Show. In 1961, Heschong became the production designer on the Western series Gunsmoke. When the series moved from Hollywood to Studio City, he had to restore and redesign the sets. The sets were built along one long street with multiple buildings and interiors, including the sheriff's office, a livery stable, a hotel lobby, and a doctor's office. He worked on about 140 episodes of Gunsmoke.Television Academy interview, tape 5. During the 1963‚Äì64 season, he also worked on The Great Adventure. The first episode of that series was \\"The Hunley\\", a story about a Civil War submarine. He prepared a full-size submarine (full-size exterior and interiors and miniatures) and docks for that production. In addition to his regular art directing work, Heschong became the head of the CBS art department in 1964. From 1965 to 1967, he also worked on another Western series, The Wild Wild West. He worked on that show from the start and designed all the sets. The writers came up with many strange concepts and effects that were a challenge, including a steam-driven wheel chair, a steam engine that spit flames, and other unusual vehicles. He did 48 episodes on Wild Wild West. He left Gunsmoke during the 1968‚Äì69 season to work on Hawaii Five-O. He also covered a few episodes of the The Bob Newhart Show in the 1970s. Television movies During the 1970s and 1980s, he worked on numerous television movies, including Steven Spielberg's Something Evil (1972). One of his favorites was the television movie Visions (1972), for which he designed a large rubble scene to show the aftermath from the explosion of a water treatment plant. He received an Emmy nomination for his art direction on Rascals and Robbers: The Secret Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn (1982). Much of his work on that project involved selecting locations in Natchez, Mississippi. He received his final Emmy nomination for My Wicked, Wicked Ways: The Legend of Errol Flynn (1985). Heschong recalled that the number of sets was enormous, and executives became very nervous about the budget. As a result, he had to cut many corners.Television Academy interview, tape 6.

Chargeback  The need to understand the components of the costs of IT, and to fund the IT organization in the face of unexpected demands from user departments, led to the development of chargeback mechanisms, in which a requesting department gets an internal bill (or \\"cross-charge\\") for the costs that are directly associated to the infrastructure, data transfer, application licenses, training, etc., which they generate. The purpose of chargeback includes: * Making departments responsible in their usage, e.g., refrain from asking for resources they are not going to use * Providing visibility to the head of IT and to senior management on the reasons behind the costs of IT * Allowing the IT department to respond to unexpected customer demand by saying \\"yes, we can do it, but you will have to pay for it\\" instead of saying \\"no, we cannot do this because it's not in the budget.\\" As of 2011, the chargeback mechanisms are often controversial in organizations. Departments rarely pay directly for their own electricity bill, janitorial services, etc. -- these are allocated to departments on the basis of the number of employees or the square footage they occupy. Similarly, departments may expect to pay a fixed allocation for IT and get a flexible set of services that meet their needs in return. While the discussion on such an allocation are always difficult, seeing actual variable charges arrive on a monthly basis for specific levels of usage can create conflict both between IT and its internal customers, and between a department manager and the users who caused resource consumption to increase and therefore costs to rise. The rise of subscription-based computing services (cloud computing) may make chargeback mechanisms more palatable.  Showback  Around 2010, the concept of IT showback emerged to keep the advantages of chargeback without some of its drawbacks. Showback consists of providing IT management, departments, and corporate management with an analysis of the IT costs due to each department, without actually cross-charging those costs. The pressure on the departments to limit their usage is less direct, but awareness of the costs usually causes department heads and senior management to question why a department is \\"spending\\" more than another in IT.

Background In 2006, Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), the federal department in charge of contracting information technology (IT) services, issued a request for proposal for an Engineering and Technical Services (ETS) contract. The contract would involve the right to manage and maintain PWGSC's main computer systems and networks.http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=3562432&Language;=E&Mode;=1&Parl;=39&Ses;=2 From 1999 to 2006, the firm that had been providing those services was TPG Technology Consulting Ltd (TPG), an Ottawa-based IT professional services company. After initially being ruled ineligible for bidding on the new ETS contract based on its size, TPG was finally ruled eligible after partnering with another organization. However, in the new request for proposals, the government officials overseeing the evaluation decided not to use certain standard government procurement practices, such as requiring a fairness monitor to review the evaluation process and providing a debrief once the contract was awarded.http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=3412493&Language;=E&Mode;=1&Parl;=39&Ses;=2 On October 31, 2007, the $400 million contract was awarded to Montreal-based CGI Group. However, there were some inconsistencies in the scoring. Before the award of the contract, TPG raised concerns about the scoring of the technical evaluation in a press conference. Believing the process had been conducted unfairly, TPG launched a lawsuit in March 2008, raising concerns about the procurement process as well as possible political intervention, particularly from PWGSC Minister, the Honourable Michael Fortier. In his previous role as Credit Suisse First Boston‚Äôs key Montreal executive in 2004, Fortier had helped to underwrite CGI's $858 million acquisition of AMS Inc. Based on this apparent conflict of interest, opposition parties and the media called for a public inquiry. These calls were denied by the Conservative government. On June 10, 2008, Don Powell, President of TPG, testified at a Parliamentary Committee about the irregularities in the ETS procurement.http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=3562432&Language;=E&Mode;=1&Parl;=39&Ses;=2 In early 2009, TPG and 17 other defendants were charged with bid-rigging by a newly appointed Crown Prosecutor, who had run for the Progressive Conservatives in the 1997 election. This charge has been presented by the media as retribution by the government against TPG and Powell for alleging unfairness in the procurement process and a political cover-up. Since 2009, the legal battle has continued, with more information coming out to indicate political intervention.https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Businessman+files+complaint+about+judge/5808643/story.html Oddities As a result of the many unusual circumstances surrounding the award of the ETS contract and its aftermath, many members of the media, politicians and judges (amongst others) have raised concerns in relation to this scandal. These include: * No fairness monitor was appointed to oversee the ETS procurement process ‚Äì it is highly unusual that the government should decide not to include one on a contract of that size. * During the evaluation process, scores given by individual evaluators did not coincide with the scores obtained by the same evaluators in a consensus process. * An outside consultant hired by PWGSC advised the evaluation team to destroy all records related to the evaluation. * The government refused to debrief the companies that had lost the award. * Even the Canadian International Trade Tribunal ruled against the government regarding some of the ways the proposals were evaluated.http://www.nomus.ca/en/nomus/raw?nodeId=21028 * Government officials refused to provide information about the evaluation. This resulted in numerous Access to Information requests and Federal Court proceedings to obtain the requested documents. Government response When asked in the House of Commons about any potential conflict of interest, the government's initial response was to deny angrily any conflict of interest.http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode;=1&Parl;=39&Ses;=1&DocId;=2832972 However, many of the questions raised in the House Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates remain unanswered. Members of the opposition parties (New Democratic Party, Bloc Qu√©b√©cois and Liberal) continue to ask about the issue but get no response from the government. In February 2009, following press conferences and an appearance by TPG's owner Don Powell to a parliamentary committee,http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=3562432&Language;=E&Mode;=1&Parl;=39&Ses;=2 a newly appointed federal Crown Prosecutor charged TPG, Powell and 17 other defendants with an as-yet-unproven allegation of bid-rigging. In April 2015 the first jury trial ended with not guilty on all counts verdicts for Marina Durward, Sue Laycock, Phil McDonald, Don Powell, Tom Townsend, Ron Walker, Devon Group, Spearhead Management and TPG Technology, with David Watts being acquitted in February by directed verdict.https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/not-guilty-times-60-jury- clears-all-accused-in-federal-bid-rigging-trial In May 2015 an official with the federal Public Prosecution Service of Canada confirmed that \\"There will be no appeal on any aspect of the trial. The case is complete\\".https://ottawacitizen.com/business/local-business/crown-wont-appeal- bid-rigging-trial-verdict Having chosen a trial in front of a judge instead of a jury, the remaining defendants, Barry Dowdall, David Gelineau, Perry Henningsen, Donna Cona Inc. and Brainhunter, still face trial on the same information and set of facts.https://ottawacitizen.com/business/local- business/crown-wont-appeal-bid-rigging-trial-verdict Conservative Party connections This scandal involves a number of present or former Conservative officials: * The Honourable Michael Fortier, a former Senator and PWGSC Minister when the contract was awarded. In his prior role as Credit Suisse First Boston's key Montreal executive in 2004, Fortier had helped to underwrite CGI's $858 million acquisition of AMS Inc. In 2003, Fortier was the co-chair of now-Prime Minister Stephen Harper‚Äôs leadership campaign, and in 2006 he was co-chair of the Conservative campaign. * Denis Pilon, a Crown Prosecutor having joined the government in late 2008. He charged TPG and its owner with bid-rigging (under the Competition Act). Pilon had been a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1997 federal election. * Justice David Near, who issued a controversial ruling on the ETS case.https://ottawacitizen.com/business/Judge+orders+trial+government+rigging+case/5506360/story.html Only 18 months prior to hearing an important motion on this case, he had been working in the office of the Conservative Minister of Justice. He was also Chief of Staff to a former Conservative Minister‚Äôs Office. Continuing controversy The cases, particularly the lawsuit by TPG and the government‚Äôs bid-rigging charges against TPG, continue to be heard in Canadian courts. TPG has also filed a lawsuit against the Government of Canada and three officials of the Competition Bureau for defamation and abuse of public office stemming from statements published by the government on the Competition Bureau website. The statements claim that there was evidence that TPG and other companies had a plan to defraud the government and to inflate prices. Initially, in July 2011, Superior Court Justice Stanley Kershman dismissed the claim on the grounds that the allegedly defamatory words were not capable of bearing defamatory meaning. However, upon TPG's appeal, the Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled in February 2012 that the dismissal of the defamation claim brought by TPG was in error, and TPG‚Äôs claim should be allowed to proceed to trial. The court ruled that Justice Kershman had erred, and it could not be determined, based solely on a Crown motion, whether or not statements made about TPG on the Government of Canada‚Äôs Competition Bureau website were defamatory. The ruling states, \\"The determination of that issue is better left to trial on a full factual record.\\" This trial is also ongoing.

Life He had participated in every one of the Belmonts' recording sessions dating back 54 years.Thedeadrockstarsclub.com - accessed January 2, 2012 Dion DiMucci said of his death; \\"I was shocked, obviously, because it was so sudden. It was already in stage four when he found out there was anything wrong with him. It hit hard because a relationship like we had, it‚Äôs ingrained in you. We knew each other from our teenage boyhoods; even though we weren‚Äôt close and didn‚Äôt talk in later years, what we went through together made us like family. He and the Belmonts ‚Äî they were the very best. Freddie was almost like a genius with vocal harmony. I was humbled to sing with Freddie, Carlo and Angelo.\\" In 2000, Dion and the Belmonts were inducted in the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. Milano died on January 1, 2012, from lung cancer in New York, at the age of 72.

It will produce hyperspectral surface images of comparable resolution to Landsat satellites. The Flora Hiperspectral is a joint project between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of NASA and the National Institute for Space Research of Brazil. Objective This mission will produce the first time in orbit, hyperspectral images with a spatial resolution and global coverage comparable to that of the Landsat satellite and CBERS program. Data will study the biochemical and biophysical properties of soil cover and the action of man (for example, deforestation and fires) on ecosystem functioning. Hyperspectral data are obtained in narrow strips, contiguous and in sufficient number to build spectra similar to the laboratory. Indicate biochemical characteristics (e.g., nutrient levels, moisture) and biophysical plants. Detect water stress, diseases, or difficulties in adapting to the ground culture. They measure of mineral absorption in exposed surfaces of rocks. In coastal and inland waters, measure chlorophyll and suspended sediment. The satellite monitoring currently only allows to observe if there is forest or not. The Plant will be able to check the chemical and physical characteristics of the vegetation, which today no satellite can do. According to reports, it will be 10 times more advanced than any satellite of the same type. JPL will provide an instrument, which cost 150 million dollars and Brazil come with providing about US$110 million, concerning a part of the satellite and part of the launch. Instruments High spectral resolution camera (200 bands between 400 and 2500 nm along a 150 km swath. Spatial resolution is 30 meters, with 14 bits quantization.

The sculpture for this memorial square was selected in a city-sponsored competition as part of a larger urban renewal project started in 2003 to revitalize the public spaces between buildings built in the 1930s along the quay. The sculpture was unveiled on June 23, 2011.http://www.archiscene.net/art/lafenice-sculpture- architecture-vision/ Site and Design Church of the Annunciation of the Catalans with its geometric patterned stonework The sculpture is situated at the intersection of several important axises, connecting the busy port to the city, tracing the boulevard flanking the waterfront, and ultimately, between the earth and sky. Its polished surface reflects the activity of people in the square as well as the surrounding civic and natural environment. The monolith consists of three and a half slightly skewed double pyramids stacked on each other. Between each pyramid, glass panels house lighting that produces a program of effects at night. The shape is integrated into the patterned stone and etched glass ‚Äòtime capsule‚Äô base that reveals strata from the 1908 earthquake below the elevated square. The sculpture also takes inspiration from the geometric patterns in the multi-colored stonework in the Norman-Arab- Byzantine architecture of the nearby Church of the Annunciation of the Catalans (Annunziata dei Catalani), built during the 12th Century on the site of a pagan temple to Neptune. Artistic influences include Anish Kapoor (Cloud Gate) and Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi (Endless Column).  Theme  The sculpture's upward thrust commemorates the collective memory of the citizens that have tenaciously rebuilt their city each time it has been devastated by war or natural disaster, most famously, the December 1908 earthquake. Nearly every building was leveled and thousands died. The mythological Phoenix bird, magically ascending from its own ashes, is a symbol of hope and renewal. The mythological Phoenix is a symbol of hope and renewal  Construction  A central column provides structure over which the highly polished, prefabricated stainless shapes are stacked. Blue glass panels protect DMX controlled LED lighting between each pyramid element. Engineering services were provided by RFR Paris. The sculpture measures 0.5 x 1 meter, 4.1 meters high and weighs 800 kilograms.  References   Sources  * p. 164-5, Encyclopedia of Earthquakes and Volcanoes; David Ritchie, Alexander E.
