It is \\"solid\\" in the sense of being composed of one piece; the shape can vary widely, including partially hollowed shapes. The term is occasionally applied to bullets (just the projectile, never the cartridge as a whole), but is most commonly applied to one-piece shotgun projectiles, to differentiate them from shotshells containing shots. Slugs are commonly fired from choked smoothbore barrels, but some specially-designed slug barrels have riflings that can impart gyroscopic spin required for in-flight stability. An airgun slug is a new type of pellet recently developed for pre-charged pneumatic airguns. Unlike the conventional diabolo-shaped pellet, which is aerodynamically poor and relies heavily on drag-stabilisation to maintain accuracy, the slug pellet is cylindro- conoidally shaped like a Mini√© ball and relies predominantly on spin- stabilisation from a rifled barrel. Because of the greater contact area with the barrel bore, these pellets require more power from the gun to overcome the frictional resistance, and therefore are mainly used in PCP airguns, which generally have much higher muzzle energy ratings than other types of airguns such as spring-piston, pump pneumatic or HPA/CO2 airguns. A water-slug refers to operating a submarine's torpedo tube that has been filled with water rather than a torpedo, thus shooting a \\"slug of water.\\" In simulated naval battles and exercises this is to represent the dispatch of an actual torpedo as, to sonar detectors, the sounds are very alike.

It ripens much later than the other varieties in Bordeaux, often too late, so it fell out of favour in its home region. When it does ripen it adds tannin, colour and flavour, in small amounts, to the blend. Petit verdot has attracted attention among winemakers in the New World, where it ripens more reliably and has been made into single varietal wine. It is also useful in 'stiffening' the mid palate of Cabernet Sauvignon blends. When young its aromas have been likened to banana and pencil shavings. Strong tones of violet and leather develop as it matures. History A glass of Petit Verdot Petit Verdot probably predates Cabernet Sauvignon in Bordeaux, but its origins are unclear. There are records of it in the eighteenth century, but its characteristics suggest an origin in much hotter climes than the Gironde. It is one parent of Tressot, the other parent being Duras, a grape from the upper Tarn valley near Toulouse.Vitis International Variety Catalogue: Tressot Noir , accessed on December 15, 2009 It's possible that both were brought to the region by the Romans as they moved inland from the Mediterranean. Distribution and wines Petit Verdot leaf =Argentina= There are some blocks of Petit Verdot in Argentina, although for many years it was labelled as Fer. =Australia= Verdot was included in James Busby's collection of 1832, and it was trialled by Sir William Macarthur in the 1840s. In 2000 there were 1600 hectares in Australia with Kingston Estate in South Australia having the largest planting, four times more than in France. It is increasingly being used to make massive, brooding, single varietal wines that will age for several years ‚Äì Pirramimma has championed this approach and Warrumbungle Wines releases only aged / cellar vintages to highlight the aging potential. =Chile= Chile had 137 ha in 2003. =France= Almost all the Petit Verdot in France is planted in Bordeaux, mostly in the M√©doc where it is used in small amounts to give structure to the classic Bordeaux blend. However the late ripening means that in some years the entire crop is lost and it only properly ripens once every four years, so it has fallen out of favour, particularly with the trend towards earlier-maturing wine. Ch√¢teau Palmer is unusual in having up to 6% Petit Verdot in its blend, which helps stiffen the high proportion of Merlot in their wines. 1‚Äì3% is more usual. =Italy= In Italy it is sometimes cultivated in Maremma (Tuscany) and Lazio. =Peru= Don Manuel by Tacama 100% Petit Verdot In Peru, Petit Verdot vines are grown in the southern Ica Region. The desert weather from Ica allows producers to make 100% varietal Petit Verdot wines. Tacama winery produces one of its high end wines, \\"Don Manuel\\", with 100% Petit Verdot grapes. =Portugal= In Portugal is sometime cultivated in Alentejo with great results due to this region's specific climatic conditions. =USA= The profusion of Meritage Bordeaux blends has seen considerable interest in the variety in California, where there was 360 ha in 2003. The more consistent, warmer climate is a big help in reliably ripening the grape, and producers are starting to experiment with single varietals. It is also planted in Arizona, Colorado, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Long Island, New York, New Mexico, and Washington. In addition to the countries above, Petit Verdot is used as 'seasoning' in Bordeaux-style blends in British Columbia, New Zealand, South Africa and Spain. Vine and viticulture The leaves have 3‚Äì5 lobes with a distinctively elongated central lobe. The small, cylindrical bunches are winged, with small black berries. The name Petit Verdot ('small green') refers to one of the main problems with the grape, that often the berries fail to develop properly without the right weather during flowering. It also refers to the late ripening which usually comes too late for the Bordeaux climate. Petit Verdot also has a peculiar characteristic in that it produces more than two clusters per shoot.

Forming on September 5, 1992, during the strong 1990‚Äì1995 El Ni√±o, Iniki was one of eleven Central Pacific tropical cyclones during that season. It attained tropical storm status on September 8 and further intensified into a hurricane the next day. After turning north, Iniki struck the island of Kauai on September 11 at peak intensity; it had winds of 145 mph and reached Category 4 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale. It had recorded wind gusts of 225 as evidenced by an anemometer that was found blown into the forest during clean up. It was the first hurricane to hit the state since Hurricane Iwa in the 1982 season, and the first major hurricane since Hurricane Dot in 1959. Iniki dissipated on September 13 about halfway between Hawaii and Alaska. Iniki caused around $3.1 billion (1992 USD) in damage and six deaths, making it the costliest natural disaster on record in the state, and the second-costliest Pacific hurricane on record. At the time, Iniki was among the costliest United States hurricanes. The storm struck just 18 days after Hurricane Andrew, the costliest tropical cyclone ever at the time, struck Florida. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches 24 hours in advance. Despite the lack of early warning, only six deaths ensued. Damage was greatest on Kauai, where the hurricane destroyed more than 1,400 houses and severely damaged more than 5,000. Though not directly in the path of the eye, Oahu experienced moderate damage from wind and storm surge. Meteorological history The origin of Iniki is unclear, but it possibly began as a tropical wave that exited the African coast on August 18. It moved westward across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and crossed Central America into the Pacific on August 28. The wave continued rapidly westward and remained disorganized. Conditions slowly became more favorable, and, as the convection concentrated around a center, the wave was classified Tropical Depression Eighteen-E on September 5. At this time, the wave was located 1700 miles (2700 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas or 1550 miles (2500 km) east-southeast of Hilo. Initially, the thunderstorm activity was not concentrated towards the center and thus the depression was not expected to intensify beyond minimal tropical storm strength. The depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until September 8, when it slowed enough to strengthen to a tropical storm. Located at the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge, Iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central Pacific; it reached hurricane status on September 9 while 470 miles (760 km) south-southeast of Hilo. The subtropical ridge, which typically keeps hurricanes well away from the Hawaiian Islands, weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed Iniki to turn to the northwest. With very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures, Iniki steadily intensified, and attained major hurricane status on September 10 while south-southwest of the island chain. Hurricane Orlene As Iniki turned to the north, it continued to strengthen, reaching a peak of 145 mph (235 km/h) winds on September 11 while 170 miles (270 km) south- southwest of Poip≈´ on the island of Kauai. It continued rapidly to the north- northeast, and made landfall on south-central Kauai early on the 11th with sustained winds of 145 mph (235 km/h), making Iniki a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The National Weather Service reported wind gusts of up to 175 mph (280 km/h). The highest recorded wind speed from Hurricane Iniki was a 227 mph (365 km/h) reading from the Navy's Makaha Ridge radar station. According to the Honolulu Advertiser, that remarkable figure was recorded at a digital weather station whose wind gauging equipment blew off after taking the measurement during the storm. After crossing the island, Iniki rapidly accelerated north-northeastward, weakened rapidly, and was absorbed by a cold front as it lost tropical characteristics and became extratropical, on September 13, about halfway between Alaska and Hawaii. Preparations The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the hurricane well in advance. For several days prior to the disaster, the CPHC and the news media forecast Iniki to remain well south of the island chain, with the only effect being some high surf conditions. Some of the standard international computer models were indicating a northward turn towards the populated Hawaiian Islands, but these were rejected by the CPHC forecasters. As late as early September 10, the CPHC suggested that Iniki would remain well to the south of the island group. It was not until a special bulletin was issued by the CPHC less than 24 hours before landfall‚Äîthat any warning was given to the public. A hurricane watch was issued for Kauai early on September 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Prior to Iniki's arrival in Kauai, 8,000 people were housed in shelters, many of whom remembered Hurricane Iwa 10 years prior. Because schools were canceled, traffic was light during the evacuation, and streets were clear by mid-morning. Rather than sending tourists to public shelters, two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storm's passage. The CPHC issued a tropical storm warning for Oahu on September 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Though not hit by the hurricane, Iniki's large wind field caused nearly 30,000 people to evacuate to 110 public shelters in Oahu. Public school buildings acted as shelters, and were for refuge only, meaning they did not provide food, cots, blankets, medications or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of Oahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went to the house of a family member or friend for shelter. The execution of the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area. For those in need, vans and buses gave emergency transportation, while police manned certain overused intersections. The two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines. Impact Hurricane Iniki was the costliest hurricane to strike the state of Hawaii, causing $3.1 billion in damage. Most damage was on the island of Kauai, where the storm destroyed thousands of homes and left a large amount of the island without power, although Oahu also suffered significant damage. Iniki also was responsible for six deaths. The hurricane nearly struck the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu. Had it hit there, Iniki, along with Hurricane Andrew and Typhoon Omar, would have struck each of the three National Weather Service offices responsible for tropical cyclone warnings within a two-month period. = Kauai = Hurricane Iniki made landfall on the south-central portion of Kauai island, bringing its dangerous inner core to the entire island. Upon making landfall the hurricane produced storm tides of 4.5‚Äì6 feet (1.4‚Äì1.8 m), with some portions of the coastlines having high-water marks of up to 18 feet (5.5 m). In addition, strong waves of up to 35 feet (10.5 m) in height crashed along the southern coastline for several hours, causing a debris line of more than 800 feet (250 m) inland. Because it moved quickly through the island, there were no reports of significant rainfall. Hurricane Iniki making landfall on Kauai Hurricane Iniki's making landfall during daylight hours, combined with the popularity of camcorders, led many Kauai residents to record much of the damage as it was occurring. The footage was later used to create an hour-long video documentary. Commercial air service was suspended. Wind damage to trees from Iniki Hurricane Iniki's high winds caused extensive damage in Kauai. 1,421 houses were destroyed, and 63 were lost from the storm surge and wave action. A total of 5,152 homes were severely damaged, while 7,178 received minor damage. On the south coast, hotels and condominiums received severe damage as well. A few were restored quickly, though some took several years to be rebuilt. One hotel‚Äîthe Coco Palms Resort famous for Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii‚Äînever reopened after the hurricane. Destroyed housing across the island left more than 7,000 people homeless after the storm's passage. Sidewalk and tree damage from Iniki Iniki's high winds also downed 26.5% of the island's transmission poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800-mile (1300 km) distribution wire system. The entire island lacked electricity and television service for an extended period of time. Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within four weeks of Iniki, while other areas were without power for up to three to four months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested, what was left was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees. Most of Iniki's damage occurred in Kauai. On the island, one person died when struck by debris, while another lost her life when a portion of her house fell on her. Offshore, two Japanese nationals died when their boat capsized. The reduced death toll was likely due to well-executed warnings and preparation. More than 100 injuries can be attributed to Iniki, though most occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane. Among those on Kauai was filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who was preparing for the final day of on-location shooting of the film Jurassic Park. He and the 130 of his cast and crew remained safely in a hotel during Iniki's passage. According to Spielberg, \\"every single structure was in shambles; roofs and walls were torn away; telephone poles and trees were down as far as the eye could see.\\" Spielberg included footage of Iniki battering the Kaua'i coastal walls as part of the completed film, where a tropical storm makes up a pivotal part of the plot. Members of the film's crew helped to clear some of the debris off of nearby roads. = Oahu = Upon passing by Oahu, Iniki produced tides of 1.7‚Äì3 feet (0.5‚Äì0.9 m) above normal. Prolonged periods of high waves severely eroded and damaged the southwestern coast of Oahu, with the areas most affected being Barbers Point through Kaena. The Waianae coastline experienced the most damage, with waves and storm surge flooding the second floor of beachside apartments. In all, Hurricane Iniki caused several million dollars in property damage, and two deaths on Oahu. =Big Island= Damage on the Island of Hawai‚Äòi was minor. Seas of were reported, along with winds. In Honok≈çhau Harbor, three or four sailboats were tossed onto the rocks and one trimaran at another harbor was sunk. A beach near Napo ªopo ªo on Kealakekua Bay lost some sand and to this day has never been the same. Aftermath Storm surge from Iniki Immediately after the storm, many were relieved to have survived the worst of the Category 4 hurricane; their complacency turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of information, as every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days. Because Iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island, communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers. Though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed, many Kauai citizens insisted on paying. In addition, entertainers from all of Hawaii, including Graham Nash (who owns a home on the north shore of Kaua ªi) and the Honolulu Symphony, provided free concerts to the victims. The film Jurassic Park was being filmed at the time; the sets used for the deleted scene where Mr. Arnold goes to the shed to turn the power on were destroyed, and the cast and crew took shelter in a hotel. Shots of Iniki made it in to the final film. Looting occurred in the aftermath of Iniki, though it was very minor. A group of Army Corps of Engineers, who experienced the looting of Hurricane Andrew just weeks before, were surprised at the overall calmness and lack of violence on the island. Although electrical power was restored to most of the island approximately six weeks following the hurricane, students returned to Kaua ªi public schools two weeks after the disaster. Kauai citizens remained hopeful for monetary aid from the government or insurance companies, though after six months they felt annoyed with the lack of help. The military effectively provided aid for their immediate needs, though, and help arrived before local officials requested aid. Amateur radio proved to be extremely helpful during the three weeks after the storm, with volunteers coming from the neighboring islands as well as from around the Pacific to assist in the recovery. There was support of local government communications in Lihue in the first week of recovery as well as a hastily organized effort by local operators to assist with the American Red Cross and their efforts to provide shelters and disaster relief centers across Kaua ªi. In the months after the storm, many insurance companies left Hawaii. To combat this, State Governor John D. Waihee III enacted the Hurricane Relief Fund in 1993 to help unprotected Hawaii residents. The fund was never needed for another Hawaii hurricane, and it was stopped in 2000 when insurance companies returned to the island. It is thought that Hurricane Iniki blew apart many chicken coops, some possibly used to house fighting chickens; this caused a dramatic increase in the numbers of feral chickens roaming Kauai. Retirement The name Iniki was retired due to this storm's impacts, and was replaced with Iolana in the Central North Pacific tropical storm list. Less than three days after Iniki struck, Hurricane Orlene struck the Big Island as a tropical depression, hampering relief efforts.

The typical alert dialog provides information in a separate box to the user, after which the user can only respond in one way: by closing it. Closing an alert dialog will provide access to the original window, which is not available while the alert dialog is presented. Alert dialogs that block the application are regarded as a bad design solution by usability practitioners, since they are prone to produce mode errors. Also when used as error dialogs, they have been shown to be ineffective in their goals to inform users about an error condition or protect from a destructive operation.  Usage  Alerts have several typical uses:Java Look and Feel Design Guidelines, second edition. * Error: informs the user than an operation could not continue or complete due to some insurmountable error. * Warning: alerts that the current course of action could be in some way dangerous or detrimental, often offering the option of not proceeding. * Info: presents a general notification about a recent event. * Question: elicits some kind of response from the user, required to complete the current process. Warning and question alerts typically offer two opposite options to close the dialog (\\"Allow/Deny\\", \\"OK/Cancel\\", \\"Yes/No\\") with the implicit assumption that one will proceed with the paused process that triggered the dialog, and the other one will interrupt the process without action. A good practice in interface design, often included in human interface guidelines, is to label each option with the precise effect that it will have on the process (for example, \\"Save/Don't save\\" in a dialog triggered while editing a document with unsaved changes). The primary reason for using an alert dialogue instead of communicating via the main program window is modality. A typical online form is non-modal. They present to a user many actions that can be performed in any sequence. By contrast an alert dialogue creates a modal state that isolates a particular element of the form and requires a user to address it before proceeding to the next step. The utility of the alert dialogue is increasing with mobile device penetration, because: * modal alerts are part of the native functionality of a mobile device, so can be deployed consistently across the device ecosystem as opposed to visual styling techniques that are prone to cross-platform inconsistency * smaller viewports (screens) make it more difficult to review the main program window looking for errors/information * smaller viewports have acclimatized users to interacting with a sequence of small screens each with a define action, rather than viewing all contextual info at once on a big screen Example \`alert()\` is the name of the method used in JavaScript to spawn an alert dialog. The argument to the method is the text to be displayed in the window. A dialog created this way will contain a yellow triangle warning symbol (similar to those found on electrical devices), the text of the warning message, and a single button saying \\"OK\\" which will close the window. Such a dialog also assumes control over the user interface, preventing the user from proceeding with any other task in the application until the dialog window is closed.  Criticism  Modal alert dialogs are prone to produce mode errors due to their unrequested nature. A study to appear at the Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society showed that when a user dialog appears, the primary goal of users is typically to get rid of them as soon as possibleFake popup study sadly confirms most users are idiots Ars Technica, 23 September 2008 even without any analysis of the causes for the dialog appearance. When asked, users dismissed any dialog box as a distraction from their assigned task. This is explained by a common complaint about the wording of the message in the alert box, which is often incomprehensible to the user. In applications without proper user-centered design, the developers decide the text of the message, including terms and concepts from the mental model of the programmer, not of the user's view of the world. Since the dialog doesn't work to accomplish the user needs, the common reaction will be to dismiss the alert without further consideration.Raymond Chen, The Old New Thing: The default answer to every dialog box is \\"Cancel\\" Dangerous actions should be undoable wherever possible; a modal dialog that appears unexpectedly or which is dismissed by habituation will not protect from the dangerous action. This problem can be avoided by providing an undo action instead of a warning,Aza Raskin, A List Apart: Never Use a Warning When you Mean Undo or showing the warning in an infobar instead of a dialog. Another recognized problem is that, as a modal window, the dialog blocks all workflow in the program until it is closed. Users may not recognize that the dialog requires their attention, leading to confusion about the main window being non- responsive, or causing loss of the user's data input. This often happens in data entry forms after an error alert produced by invalid data. The preferred design include changing a visual aspect of the input element to reflect an invalid entry (such as applying a red border), or adding a character such as an asterisk next to the input element that needs to be corrected.

This phenomenon sometimes occurs regardless of the individual's knowledge that past tasks of a similar nature have taken longer to complete than generally planned. The bias affects predictions only about one's own tasks; when outside observers predict task completion times, they show a pessimistic bias, overestimating the time needed. The planning fallacy requires that predictions of current tasks' completion times are more optimistic than the beliefs about past completion times for similar projects and that predictions of the current tasks' completion times are more optimistic than the actual time needed to complete the tasks. The planning fallacy was first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. Decision Research Technical Report PTR-1042-77-6. In In 2003, Lovallo and Kahneman proposed an expanded definition as the tendency to underestimate the time, costs, and risks of future actions and at the same time overestimate the benefits of the same actions. According to this definition, the planning fallacy results in not only time overruns, but also cost overruns and benefit shortfalls.  Empirical evidence  = For individual tasks = In a 1994 study, 37 psychology students were asked to estimate how long it would take to finish their senior theses. The average estimate was 33.9 days. They also estimated how long it would take \\"if everything went as well as it possibly could\\" (averaging 27.4 days) and \\"if everything went as poorly as it possibly could\\" (averaging 48.6 days). The average actual completion time was 55.5 days, with only about 30% of the students completing their thesis in the amount of time they predicted. Another study asked students to estimate when they would complete their personal academic projects. Specifically, the researchers asked for estimated times by which the students thought it was 50%, 75%, and 99% probable their personal projects would be done. * 13% of subjects finished their project by the time they had assigned a 50% probability level; * 19% finished by the time assigned a 75% probability level; * 45% finished by the time of their 99% probability level. A survey of Canadian tax payers, published in 1997, found that they mailed in their tax forms about a week later than they predicted. They had no misconceptions about their past record of getting forms mailed in, but expected that they would get it done more quickly next time. This illustrates a defining feature of the planning fallacy; that people recognize that their past predictions have been over-optimistic, while insisting that their current predictions are realistic. = For group tasks = Carter and colleagues conducted three studies in 2005 that demonstrate empirical support that the planning fallacy also affects predictions concerning group tasks. This research emphasizes the importance of how temporal frames and thoughts of successful completion contribute to the planning fallacy. = Additional studies = Bent Flyvbjerg and Cass Sunstein argue that Albert O. Hirschman's Hiding Hand principle is the planning fallacy writ large, and they tested the empirical validity of the principle. See also further reading below for additional studies.  Proposed explanations  * Kahneman and Tversky originally explained the fallacy by envisaging that planners focus on the most optimistic scenario for the task, rather than using their full experience of how much time similar tasks require.Buehler, Roger; Griffin, Dale, & Ross, Michael (2002). \\"Inside the planning fallacy: The causes and consequences of optimistic time predictions\\". In Thomas Gilovich, Dale Griffin, & Daniel Kahneman (Eds.), Heuristics and biases: The psychology of intuitive judgment, pp. 250‚Äì270. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. * Roger Buehler and colleagues account for the fallacy by examining wishful thinking; in other words, people think tasks will be finished quickly and easily because that is what they want to be the case. * In a different paper, Buehler and colleagues suggest an explanation in terms of the self-serving bias in how people interpret their past performance. By taking credit for tasks that went well but blaming delays on outside influences, people can discount past evidence of how long a task should take. One experiment found that when people made their predictions anonymously, they do not show the optimistic bias. This suggests that the people make optimistic estimates so as to create a favorable impression with others, which is similar to the concepts outlined in impression management theory. * Another explanation proposed by Roy and colleagues is that people do not correctly recall the amount of time that similar tasks in the past had taken to complete; instead people systematically underestimate the duration of those past events. Thus, a prediction about future event duration is biased because memory of past event duration is also biased. Roy and colleagues note that this memory bias does not rule out other mechanisms of the planning fallacy. * Sanna and colleagues examined temporal framing and thinking about success as a contributor to the planning fallacy. They found that when people were induced to think about a deadline as distant (i.e., much time remaining) vs. rapidly approaching (i.e., little time remaining), they made more optimistic predictions and had more thoughts of success. In their final study, they found that the ease of generating thoughts also caused more optimistic predictions. * One explanation, focalism, proposes that people fall victim to the planning fallacy because they only focus on the future task and do not consider similar tasks of the past that took longer to complete than expected. * As described by Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month, adding new personnel to an already- late project incurs a variety of risks and overhead costs that tend to make it even later; this is known as Brooks's law. * The \\"authorization imperative\\" offers another possible explanation: much of project planning takes place in a context which requires financial approval to proceed with the project, and the planner often has a stake in getting the project approved. This dynamic may lead to a tendency on the part of the planner to deliberately underestimate the project effort required. It is easier to get forgiveness (for overruns) than permission (to commence the project if a realistic effort estimate were provided). Such deliberate underestimation has been named by Jones and Euske \\"strategic misrepresentation\\". * Apart from psychological explanations, the phenomenon of the planning fallacy has also been explained by Taleb as resulting from natural asymmetry and from scaling issues. The asymmetry results from random events giving negative results of delay or cost, not evenly balanced between positive and negative results. The scaling difficulties relate to the observation that consequences of disruptions are not linear, that as size of effort increases the error increases much more as a natural effect of inefficiencies of larger efforts' ability to react, particularly efforts that are not divisible in increments. Additionally this is contrasted with earlier efforts being more commonly on-time (e.g. the Empire State Building, The Crystal Palace, the Golden Gate Bridge) to conclude it indicates inherent flaws in more modern planning systems and modern efforts having hidden fragility. (For example, that modern efforts ‚Äì being computerized and less localized invisibly ‚Äì have less insight and control, and more dependencies on transportation.)  Methods for counteracting  = Segmentation effect = The segmentation effect is defined as the time allocated for a task being significantly smaller than the sum of the time allocated to individual smaller sub-tasks of that task. In a study performed by Forsyth in 2008, this effect was tested to determine if it could be used to reduce the planning fallacy. In three experiments, the segmentation effect was shown to be influential. However, the segmentation effect demands a great deal of cognitive resources and is not very feasible to use in everyday situations. = Implementation intentions = Implementation intentions are concrete plans that accurately show how, when, and where one will act. It has been shown through various experiments that implementation intentions help people become more aware of the overall task and see all possible outcomes. Initially, this actually causes predictions to become even more optimistic. However, it is believed that forming implementation intentions \\"explicitly recruits willpower\\" by having the person commit themselves to the completion of the task. Those that had formed implementation intentions during the experiments began work on the task sooner, experienced fewer interruptions, and later predictions had reduced optimistic bias than those who had not. It was also found that the reduction in optimistic bias was mediated by the reduction in interruptions. = Reference class forecasting = Reference class forecasting predicts the outcome of a planned action based on actual outcomes in a reference class of similar actions to that being forecast.  Real-world examples  Sydney Opera House, still under construction in 1966, three years after its expected completion date The Sydney Opera House was expected to be completed in 1963. A scaled-down version opened in 1973, a decade later. The original cost was estimated at $7 million, but its delayed completion led to a cost of $102 million. The Eurofighter Typhoon defense project took six years longer than expected, with an overrun cost of 8 billion euros. The Boston Central Artery (also known as \\"The Big Dig\\") was completed seven years later than planned, costing another $12 billion. The Denver International Airport opened sixteen months later than scheduled, with a total cost of $4.8 billion, over $2 billion more than expected. The Berlin Brandenburg Airport is another egregious case. After 15 years of planning, construction began in 2006, with the opening planned for October 2011. There were numerous delays. It is currently estimated that this airport will be opened in 2021. The original budget was ‚Ç¨2.83 billion; current projections are close to ‚Ç¨10.0 billion.

It is useful in computer science, especially in the field of public-key cryptography. The operation of modular exponentiation calculates the remainder when an integer (the base) raised to the th power (the exponent), , is divided by a positive integer (the modulus). In symbols, given base , exponent , and modulus , the modular exponentiation is: . From the definition of , it follows that . For example, given , and , the solution is the remainder of dividing by . Modular exponentiation can be performed with a negative exponent by finding the modular multiplicative inverse of modulo using the extended Euclidean algorithm. That is: :, where and . Modular exponentiation similar to the one described above is considered easy to compute, even when the integers involved are enormous. On the other hand, computing the modular discrete logarithm ‚Äì that is, the task of finding the exponent when given , , and ‚Äì is believed to be difficult. This one-way function behavior makes modular exponentiation a candidate for use in cryptographic algorithms. .  Direct method  The most direct method of calculating a modular exponent is to calculate directly, then to take this number modulo . Consider trying to compute , given , , and : : One could use a calculator to compute 413; this comes out to 67,108,864. Taking this value modulo 497, the answer is determined to be 445. Note that is only one digit in length and that is only two digits in length, but the value is 8 digits in length. In strong cryptography, is often at least 1024 bits. Consider and , both of which are perfectly reasonable values. In this example, is 77 digits in length and is 2 digits in length, but the value is 1,304 decimal digits in length. Such calculations are possible on modern computers, but the sheer magnitude of such numbers causes the speed of calculations to slow considerably. As and increase even further to provide better security, the value becomes unwieldy. The time required to perform the exponentiation depends on the operating environment and the processor. The method described above requires multiplications to complete.  Memory-efficient method  Keeping the numbers smaller requires additional modular reduction operations, but the reduced size makes each operation faster, saving time (as well as memory) overall. This algorithm makes use of the identity : The modified algorithm is: # Set , . # Increase by 1. # Set . # If , go to step 2. Else, contains the correct solution to . Note that in every pass through step 3, the equation holds true. When step 3 has been executed times, then, contains the answer that was sought. In summary, this algorithm basically counts up by ones until reaches , doing a multiply by and a modulo operation each time it adds one (to ensure the results stay small). The example , , and is presented again. The algorithm passes through step 3 thirteen times:     * The final answer for is therefore 445, as in the first method. Like the first method, this requires multiplications to complete. However, since the numbers used in these calculations are much smaller than the numbers used in the first algorithm's calculations, the computation time decreases by a factor of at least in this method. In pseudocode, this method can be performed the following way: function modular_pow(base, exponent, modulus) is if modulus = 1 then return 0 c := 1 for e_prime = 0 to exponent-1 do c := (c * base) mod modulus return c  Right-to-left binary method  A third method drastically reduces the number of operations to perform modular exponentiation, while keeping the same memory footprint as in the previous method. It is a combination of the previous method and a more general principle called exponentiation by squaring (also known as binary exponentiation). First, it is required that the exponent be converted to binary notation. That is, can be written as: : e = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i 2^i In such notation, the length of is bits. can take the value 0 or 1 for any such that . By definition, . The value can then be written as: : b^e = b^{\\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i 2^i \\\\right)} = \\\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} b^{a_i 2^i} The solution is therefore: : c \\\\equiv \\\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} b^{a_i 2^i} \\\\pmod m = Pseudocode = The following is an example in pseudocode based on Applied Cryptography by Bruce Schneier.Schneier 1996, p. 244. The inputs base, exponent, and modulus correspond to , , and in the equations given above. function modular_pow(base, exponent, modulus) is if modulus = 1 then return 0 Assert :: (modulus - 1) * (modulus - 1) does not overflow base result := 1 base := base mod modulus while exponent > 0 do if (exponent mod 2  1) then result := (result * base) mod modulus exponent := exponent >> 1 base := (base * base) mod modulus return result Note that upon entering the loop for the first time, the code variable base is equivalent to . However, the repeated squaring in the third line of code ensures that at the completion of every loop, the variable base is equivalent to , where is the number of times the loop has been iterated. (This makes the next working bit of the binary exponent exponent, where the least-significant bit is exponent0). The first line of code simply carries out the multiplication in \\\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} b^{a_i 2^i}\\\\pmod m. If is zero, no code executes since this effectively multiplies the running total by one. If instead is one, the variable base (containing the value of the original base) is simply multiplied in. In this example, the base is raised to the exponent . The exponent is 1101 in binary. There are four binary digits, so the loop executes four times, with values , and . First, initialize the result R to 1 and preserve the value of in the variable : : R \\\\leftarrow 1 \\\\, ( = b^0) \\\\text{ and } x \\\\leftarrow b . : Step 1) bit 1 is 1, so set R \\\\leftarrow R \\\\cdot x \\\\text{ }(= b^1) ; :: set x \\\\leftarrow x^2 \\\\text{ }(= b^2) . : Step 2) bit 2 is 0, so do not reset ; :: set x \\\\leftarrow x^2 \\\\text{ }(= b^4) . : Step 3) bit 3 is 1, so set R \\\\leftarrow R \\\\cdot x \\\\text{ }(= b^5) ; :: set x \\\\leftarrow x^2 \\\\text{ }(= b^8) . : Step 4) bit 4 is 1, so set R \\\\leftarrow R \\\\cdot x \\\\text{ }(= b^{13}) ; :: This is the last step so we don't need to square . We are done: is now b^{13}. Here is the above calculation, where we compute to the power , performed modulo 497. Initialize: : R \\\\leftarrow 1 \\\\, ( = b^0) and x \\\\leftarrow b = 4 . : Step 1) bit 1 is 1, so set R \\\\leftarrow R \\\\cdot 4 \\\\equiv 4 \\\\pmod{497} ; :: set x \\\\leftarrow x^2 \\\\text{ }(= b^2) \\\\equiv 4^2 \\\\equiv 16 \\\\pmod{497} . : Step 2) bit 2 is 0, so do not reset ; :: set x \\\\leftarrow x^2 \\\\text{ }(= b^4) \\\\equiv 16^2\\\\equiv 256 \\\\pmod{497} . : Step 3) bit 3 is 1, so set R \\\\leftarrow R \\\\cdot x \\\\text{ }(= b^5) \\\\equiv 4 \\\\cdot 256 \\\\equiv 30 \\\\pmod{497} ; :: set x \\\\leftarrow x^2 \\\\text{ }(= b^8) \\\\equiv 256^2 \\\\equiv 429 \\\\pmod{497} . : Step 4) bit 4 is 1, so set R \\\\leftarrow R \\\\cdot x \\\\text{ }(= b^{13}) \\\\equiv 30 \\\\cdot 429 \\\\equiv 445 \\\\pmod{497} ; We are done: is now 4^{13} \\\\equiv 445 \\\\pmod{497}, the same result obtained in the previous algorithms. The running time of this algorithm is exponent. When working with large values of exponent, this offers a substantial speed benefit over the previous two algorithms, whose time is exponent. For example, if the exponent was 220 = 1048576, this algorithm would have 20 steps instead of 1048576 steps. = Implementation in Lua = function modPow(b,e,m) if m  1 then return 0 else local r = 1 b = b % m while e > 0 do if e % 2  1 then r = (r*b) % m end e = e >> 1 --use 'e = math.floor(e / 2)' on Lua 5.2 or older b = (b^2) % m end return r end end  Left-to-right binary method  We can also use the bits of the exponent in left to right order. In practice, we would usually want the result modulo some modulus . In that case, we would reduce each multiplication result before proceeding. For simplicity, the modulus calculation is omitted here. This example shows how to compute b^{13} using left to right binary exponentiation. The exponent is 1101 in binary; there are 4 bits, so there are 4 iterations. Initialize the result to 1: r \\\\leftarrow 1 \\\\, ( = b^0). : Step 1) r \\\\leftarrow r^2 \\\\, ( = b^0); bit 1 = 1, so compute r \\\\leftarrow r \\\\cdot b \\\\,( = b^1); : Step 2) r \\\\leftarrow r^2 \\\\, ( = b^2); bit 2 = 1, so compute r \\\\leftarrow r \\\\cdot b \\\\, ( = b^3); : Step 3) r \\\\leftarrow r^2 \\\\, ( = b^6); bit 3 = 0, so we are done with this step; : Step 4) r \\\\leftarrow r^2 \\\\, ( = b^{12}); bit 4 = 1, so compute r \\\\leftarrow r \\\\cdot b \\\\, ( = b^{13}). = Minimum multiplications = In The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 2, Seminumerical Algorithms, page 463, Donald Knuth notes that contrary to some assertions, this method does always give the minimum possible number of multiplications. The smallest counterexample is for a power of 15, when the binary method needs six multiplications. Instead, form x3 in two multiplications, then x6 by squaring x3, then x12 by squaring x6, and finally x15 by multiplying x12 and x3, thereby achieving the desired result with only five multiplications. However, many pages follow describing how such sequences might be contrived in general.  Generalizations  = Matrices = The -th term of any constant-recursive sequence (such as Fibonacci numbers or Perrin numbers) where each term is a linear function of previous terms can be computed efficiently modulo by computing , where is the corresponding companion matrix. The above methods adapt easily to this application. This can be used for primality testing of large numbers , for example. ; Pseudocode A recursive algorithm for \`ModExp(A, b, c)\` = , where is a square matrix. function Matrix_ModExp(Matrix A, int b, int c) is if b  0 then return I // The identity matrix if (b mod 2  1) then return (A * Matrix_ModExp(A, b - 1, c)) mod c Matrix D := Matrix_ModExp(A, b / 2, c) return (D * D) mod c = Finite cyclic groups = Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange uses exponentiation in finite cyclic groups. The above methods for modular matrix exponentiation clearly extend to this context. The modular matrix multiplication is simply replaced everywhere by the group multiplication . = Reversible and quantum modular exponentiation = In quantum computing, modular exponentiation appears as the bottleneck of Shor's algorithm, where it must be computed by a circuit consisting of reversible gates, which can be further broken down into quantum gates appropriate for a specific physical device. Furthermore, in Shor's algorithm it is possible to know the base and the modulus of exponentiation at every call, which enables various circuit optimizations.  Software implementations  Because modular exponentiation is an important operation in computer science, and there are efficient algorithms (see above) that are much faster than simply exponentiating and then taking the remainder, many programming languages and arbitrary-precision integer libraries have a dedicated function to perform modular exponentiation: * Python's built-in \`pow()\` (exponentiation) function takes an optional third argument, the modulus * .NET Framework's \`BigInteger\` class has a \`ModPow()\` method to perform modular exponentiation * Java's \`java.math.BigInteger\` class has a method to perform modular exponentiation *Wolfram Language has the PowerMod function * Perl's \`Math::BigInt\` module has a \`bmodpow()\` method to perform modular exponentiation * Raku has a built-in routine \`expmod\`. * Go's \`big.Int\` type contains an \`Exp()\` (exponentiation) method whose third parameter, if non-nil, is the modulus * PHP's BC Math library has a \`bcpowmod()\` function to perform modular exponentiation * The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP) library contains a \`mpz_powm()\` function to perform modular exponentiation * Custom Function \`@PowerMod()\` for FileMaker Pro (with 1024-bit RSA encryption example) * Ruby's \`openssl\` package has the \`OpenSSL::BN#mod_exp\` method to perform modular exponentiation. * The HP Prime Calculator has the CAS.powmod() function to perform modular exponentiation. For a^b mod c, a can be no larger than 1 EE 12. This is the maximum precision of most HP calculators including the Prime.

He was born in Quebec City in 1906. From the age of fourteen until his graduation in 1926 he studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Qu√©bec. His early canvases, from his first visit to Paris, show a marked fauvist tendency. Biography Alfred Pelland was born in Quebec City on 16 May 1906. His mother, R√©gina Damphousse, died when he was young, and his father, Alfred Pelland, a locomotive engineer, raised their three children. In school, Pellan filled the margins of his notebooks with drawings and excelled at his art classes, with little interest in other subjects. He later changed his surname to \\"Pellan\\". In 1920, Pellan enrolled at the School of Fine Arts of Quebec. He won first prizes in advanced courses and earned medals in painting, drawing, sculpture, sketching, anatomy and advertising. He sold his first painting at the age of 17 to the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa. In 1926 Pellan received the first fine arts scholarship in Quebec, which allowed him to spend several years in Paris and visit Venice. He studied at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris (1926‚Äì1930), where he received a first prize in painting in 1928 (Lucien Simon's studio). When his scholarship ended he prolonged his stay in Paris till 1940 with the help of his father, often working alone while attending the Grande Chaumi√®re, Colarossi and Ranson art academies. He won first prize at the exhibition of mural art in 1935 in Paris and rubbed elbows with the most famous artists of the time. Traveling Europe, he became \\"permeated by the mainstream art of the era\\". Returning to Quebec in 1936 hoping to be appointed professor at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in his hometown, he was rejected by the jury, who found him too \\"modern\\". With the outbreak of war he again returned to Quebec in 1940 and settled in Montreal. Works he brought back with him were praised in exhibitions in Quebec and Montreal but the cubist and surrealist works were considered too avant-garde and most did not find a buyer. From 1943 to 1952 he taught at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Montreal. His active opposition to the theories of Charles Maillard, the school's director, succeeded in pressuring Maillard to resign in 1944. The school then became more liberal in its approach. Pellan committed himself to an independent art, more open to universality and evolution. During the 1940s, Pellan illustrated poetry books and designed costumes and sets for the theatre. His style matured and developed during this period. Surrealism began to attract him more strongly: his imagery became more erotic and his paintings, always vivid and striking, became larger, more complex and more textured. No longer believing in art schools, in early 1948 he co-signed Prism of Eyes, a manifesto written by Jacques de Tonnancour advocating freedom of expression in art, speaking for a group that called for art free of any ideology. Later that year, an even more radical group was formed, which produced the manifesto Refus global first set out by Borduas, which completely overshadowed the earlier manifesto. Pellan received a scholarship in 1952 from the Royal Society of Canada and returned to Paris until 1955, with his wife Madeleine, whom he had married in 1949. During his stay, the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de Paris in Paris organized an exhibition of 181 of his works, sponsored by the governments of France and Canada. Pellan was the first Canadian to be given a solo exhibition in Paris in the museum. Works by Pellan along with those of David Milne, Goodridge Roberts and Emily Carr represented Canada at the Venice Biennale in 1952. Back in Quebec for two years, he resumed his painting classes in 1957 as a professor at the Art Centre of Sainte-Ad√®le while living in his house in Auteuil, Laval, where he took up residence in 1950. His reputation continued to grow among Canadian art experts, he became more widely known through various exhibitions, both solo and group, and he received commissions for murals, which established his fame throughout the country. In 1971, he received an honorary doctorate from Sir George Williams University, which later became Concordia University. Death In 1978, Pellan was diagnosed with leukemia and produced only five works during his last ten years with the aid of his assistant Michel Vermeulen. He died in Montreal on 31 October 1988, aged 82; he was interred in the Parc du Souvenir in Auteuil. His wife died in 2010. Recognition and legacy Several monographs and documentaries were devoted to him during his lifetime. He received a number of awards and honours, notably Companion of the Order of Canada. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. On 21 April 1995 Canada Post issued 'Blossoming, c. 1950, Alfred Pellan' in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on a painting \\"Blossoming\\", circa 1950 by Alfred Pellan in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario. The 88¬¢ stamps are perforated 13 X 13.5 and were printed by Canadian Bank Note Company, Limited.Canada Post stamp, collectionscanada.gc.ca; accessed 22 June 2015.

It travels diagonally across southern Georgia (but is signed as north‚Äìsouth) from Brunswick at US 17/SR 25 to Barnesville at US 41/SR 7/SR 18\\\\. It is a spur route of US 41 and has two intersections with it: in Perry and at its northern terminus in Barnesville. Route description The following portions of US 341 are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: *From its southern terminus in Brunswick to the US 41 intersection in Perry *From just south-southeast of Fort Valley to just north- northwest of Fort Valley. =Brunswick to Jesup= US 341 begins at an intersection with US 17 and SR 25 (Glynn Avenue) in the southeast corner of the city of Brunswick, a short distance north of the Sidney Lanier Bridge. US 341 and its state route companion, SR 27, head west along 4th Street, a four- lane undivided street. The highway turns north onto Newcastle Street and passes along the edge of the Port of Brunswick. Newcastle Street becomes two lanes at 1st Avenue; US 341/SR 27 turns west onto Prince Street then north onto Bay Street, which becomes a four-lane divided highway immediately to the south of the intersection. The highway parallels Norfolk Southern Railway's Brunswick District north between downtown Brunswick to the east and an industrial area along the East River. At the north end of downtown, US 341 has an oblique intersection with US 25 (Newcastle Street), whose companion route is SR 25 Connector (SR 25 Conn.) and which serves as the main street of downtown Brunswick. US 25/US 341/SR 27 continues north along Newcastle Street as a four-lane highway with center turn lane out of the city of Brunswick. The highway has a partial interchange with Norwich Street and its name changes to Norwich Street Extended. The highways cross over the paralleling rail line and have a partial interchange with Ross Road and another road that parallels the railroad. In the unincorporated community of Dock Junction, the highways intersect SR 303, which heads east as Community Road and west as Blythe Island Highway. Immediately to the south of the intersection is an acute intersection with SR 303 Conn., which serves as a cutoff between US 25/US 341/SR 27 and SR 303\\\\. The highways continue as New Jesup Highway across Yellow Bluff Creek and expand to a six-lane divided highway ahead of their partial cloverleaf interchange with I-95. US 25/US 341/SR 27 become a four-lane highway with center turn lane again, intersect CSX's Brunswick Subdivision at grade, and intersect SR 32 and SR 99 in the hamlet of Sterling. SR 99 heads east as Grants Ferry Road; SR 32 and SR 99 head west as Harrell Highway. US 25/US 341/SR 27 closely parallels the Norfolk Southern rail line northwest from Glynn County into Wayne County and to the city of Jesup. The three highways enter the city as Cherry Street between their crossing of Penholoway Creek and their intersection with US 301/SR 23; US 25 splits north to join US 301/SR 23 toward Ludowici. Just north of the US 301/SR 23 intersection, US 341/SR 27 turns north onto Pine Street, a four-lane street with center turn lane that curves northwest and parallels Cherry Street through the city. The highways cross over CSX's Nahunta Subdivision between the Jesup Amtrak station and the orthogonal intersection of the CSX and Norfolk Southern lines. North of the CSX line, US 341/SR 27 intersects US 84/SR 38 (1st Street). The highways have an oblique intersection with SR 169 (Lanes Bridge Road) and collects the western end of Cherry Street as it leaves Jesup as Odum Highway. US 341/SR 27 travels through the town of Odum as its Main Street and crosses to the north side of the Norfolk Southern rail line in an S curve at the Wayne‚ÄìAppling county line. =Jesup to Hawkinsville= US 341/SR 27 continues west as Golden Isles Parkway. The highway intersects SR 121 (Still Street) in the town of Surrency and crosses Satilla Creek. US 341/SR 27 meets US 1/SR 4/SR 15 (Main Street) in the city of Baxley, through which US 341/SR 27 follows Parker Street. US 341/SR 27 continues northwest into Jeff Davis County and the city of Hazlehurst. The two highways enter along Jarman Street and intersects and travels concurrently with US 23/US 221 Truck/SR 19/SR 135 Truck. Near the center of town, the six highways meet the northbound lanes of US 221/SR 135 (Cromartie Street). Northbound US 221/SR 135 travels concurrently with US 23/US 341/SR 19/SR 27 as they curve onto Coffee Street and have an oblique intersection with Tallahassee Street, which heads south as the southbound lanes of US 221/SR 135 and north with both directions of those highways. US 23/US 341/SR 19/SR 27 leaves town as Lumber City Highway. The four highways cross the Ocmulgee River just west of its confluence with the Little Ocmulgee River and enter Telfair County and Lumber City as Golden Isles Highway. Within the city, SR 19 splits northeast toward Glenwood and the other three highways meet the eastern terminus of SR 117 (Main Street), then intersect at grade the Norfolk Southern rail line. US 23/US 341/SR 27 enters the city of McRae as Oak Street; east of downtown, the highways split into a one-way pair, Railroad Street northbound and Oak Street southbound. The streets intersect 3rd Avenue, which carries US 280/US 441/SR 30/SR 31, before rejoining and entering the neighboring city of Helena, where US 23/US 341/SR 27 intersects a CSX rail line. The three highways follow McRae Highway when they enter Dodge County. The highway has a pair of intersections with SR 165, Chauncey‚ÄìDublin Highway and Chauncey‚ÄìRhine Highway, as it travels through the town of Chauncey. On the southern edge of Eastman, US 23/US 341 Bus./SR 27 Bus. (College Street) continue straight parallel to the Norfolk Southern rail line toward the center of town while US 341/SR 27 splits west to bypass the town. US 341/SR 27 intersects SR 87 and SR 117 (Rhine Highway) south of town and meets the northern terminus of US 341 Bus./SR 27 Bus. (Hawkinsville Highway) on the west side of town. US 341/SR 27 becomes Eastman Highway and crosses Mosquito Creek as it enters Pulaski County and approaches the city of Hawkinsville. =Hawkinsville to Barnesville= Just east of Hawkinsville, in Hartford, US 341 and SR 27 have a four-legged intersection with several highways. The south leg of the intersection is Lower River Road, which carries SR 230\\\\. The north leg of the intersection is Cochran Highway, which carries US 129 Alt./SR 26/SR 112/SR 257\\\\. The seven highways head west along Eastman Highway, whose carriageways split as they approach the Ocmulgee River. The westbound and eastbound roadways enter the city of Hawkinsville along Commerce Street and Broad Street, respectively. Immediately to the west of the river, all of the routes except SR 27 turn south from the westbound roadway onto a one-way street, which joins Broad Street as its westbound lanes. US 341 Bus. and SR 27 continue west from the turn along Commerce Street. The six-route concurrency continues to Jackson Street, where US 129 Alt. reaches its southern terminus. Jackson Street carries US 129/SR 11/SR 112 to the south and US 129 Bus./SR 11 Bus. to the north. US 129/US 341/SR 11/SR 27/SR 230/SR 257 continues west along Broad Street; SR 27 and SR 257 split southwest onto McCormick Avenue at the west end of downtown. SR 230 continues west along Broad Street while US 129/US 341/SR 11 turns north onto an unnamed street. The three highways intersect SR 26 (Commerce Street) and intersect the northern terminus of US 129 Bus./US 341 Bus./SR 11 Bus. on the northwestern edge of the city. As the highways leave the Hawkinsville area, US 129 and its companion SR 247 split northwest onto Warner Robins Highway; US 341 and SR 11 follow Perry Highway toward Houston County. At Hayneville, the highway meets the eastern terminus of SR 224 (Larry Walker Parkway), a four-lane divided highway which leads directly to I-75, while US 341/SR 11 continues northwest toward Perry as a two-lane road. The highway crosses over a Norfolk Southern rail line at Clinchfield, then crosses Big Indian Creek and meets the southern terminus of SR 247 Spur. The two highways enter the city of Perry as Main Street. US 341/SR 11 has an acute intersection with SR 127 (Houston Lake Road), with which the highways travel concurrently for five blocks. SR 11 diverges from US 341 onto Meeting Street to join US 41 to the north; two blocks to the west, US 341/SR 127 turns north onto Ball Street and intersects US 41/SR 7 (Commerce Street); the latter route becomes US 341's companion state highway. US 341/SR 7 becomes a four-lane divided highway, Sam Nunn Boulevard, at the convergence of Ball Street and Washington Street and meets I-75 at a diamond interchange. Northwest of Perry, US 341/SR 7 reduces to two lanes and closely parallels a Norfolk Southern rail line into Peach County. The highways enter the city of Fort Valley as Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. Just east of downtown, US 341/SR 7 turns onto Oakland Heights Parkway, which crosses over a second Norfolk Southern rail line before meeting and becoming concurrent with SR 96 at an acute intersection. The two highways diverge from SR 96 (Vineville Street) at its intersection with SR 49 (Camellia Boulevard), then intersects a third Norfolk Southern rail line. US 341/SR 7 intersects SR 49 Conn./SR 540 (Fall Line Freeway) as it leaves Fort Valley shortly before entering Crawford County. The highways enter the town of Roberta along Dugger Avenue, which meets the eastern terminus of SR 128 (Agency Street). US 341 also intersects US 80/SR 22 (Crusselle Street). At the same intersection, US 341/SR 7 becomes concurrent with SR 42, which follows US 80/SR 22 east to the adjacent community of Knoxville. US 341/SR 7 and SR 42 diverge at the hamlet of Musella. The two highways travel through the southwestern corner of Monroe County, where they meet SR 74 at a roundabout just north of the town of Culloden and SR 83 near the hamlet of Strouds. US 341/SR 7 continues northwest into Lamar County and reaches its northern terminus at a three-legged intersection with US 41 and SR 18 on the southeastern edge of Barnesville. SR 7 continues north from the intersection with US 41 and SR 18 toward the center of the city. Major intersections Special routes =Eastman business loop= U.S. Route 341 Business (US 341 Bus.) in Eastman, Georgia travels concurrently with SR 27 Bus. as well as part of US 23 and part of SR 46\\\\. =Hawkinsville business loop= U.S. Route 341 Business (US 341 Bus.) in Hawkinsville, Georgia begins on SR 26 (Commerce Street) and travels west until it branches off to the northwest across from Warren Street. It also travels concurrently with US 129 Bus. and SR 11 Bus. =Perry bypass route= U.S. Route 341 Bypass (US 341 Byp.) around Perry, Georgia is the northern half of an unfinished loop around the city. It also travels concurrently with SR 11 from US 341 to US 41 and SR 11 Conn. west of US 41\\\\. In March 2018, the Georgia Department of Transportation petitioned AASHTO to eliminate US 341 Byp. in favor of re-routing mainline US 341 onto the bypass route. The entire length of US 341 Byp. is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense.

It is tied by unraveling the strands of a twisted rope, knotting the strands together, then laying up the strands together again. It may also be tied using several separate cords, in which case it keeps the cords together in a bundle. The traditional use of the knot is to form a knob or \\"stopper\\" to prevent the end of the rope from passing through a hole, for instance in rigging the lanyards which tension the shrouds on older sailing ships with standing rigging of fiber cordage. It is not specifically known who Matthew Walker was, nor why this knot was named for him. However, early references from the 19th century suggest he may have been a ship's rigger in the Royal Navy. The following quote from The Ashley Book of Knots gives possible origins of the knot:Ashley, Clifford (1944). The Ashley Book of Knots, p.118. . > The FULL or DOUBLE MATTHEW WALKER KNOT. Lever in 1808 speaks of \\"MATTHEW > WALKER'S KNOT\\" and describes the knot which Alston in 1860 calls the \\"DOUBLE > MATTHEW WALKER KNOT.\\" A refinement of the original knot had in the meantime > taken over the original name , which is now generally modified to \\"a MATTHEW > WALKER.. Lever's familiar expression, \\"MATTHEW WALKER'S KNOT,\\" suggests that > he may have known the inventor, who was possibly a master rigger in one of > the British naval dockyards. Many myths have grown up around Matthew Walker, > \\"the only man ever to have a knot named for him.\\" Dr. Frederic Lucas, of the > American Museum of Natural History, once told me the following story of the > Origin of the knot, which he had heard off the Chincha Islands while loading > guano in 1869. A sailor, having been sentenced to death by a judge who in > earlier life had been a sailor himself, was reprieved by the judge because > of their common fellowship of the sea. The judge offered the sailor a full > pardon if he could show him a knot that he, the judge, could neither tie nor > untie. The sailor called for ten fathoms of rope and, having retired to the > privacy of his cell, unlaid the rope halfway, put in a MATTHEW WALKER KNOT, > and then laid up the rope again to the end. So Matthew Walker secured his > pardon, and the world gained an excellent knot. This knot is highly decorative, and was historically one of the most common and important knots. On a modern yacht, it is almost unused and unknown. It has been used in making stopper knots where lariats are used. How to tie left A Matthew Walker knot is tied in a circular bundle of any number of strands. To tie the knot, the tier takes each strand and forms a loop around the rest of the bundle, then passes the end through the newly formed loop to form an overhand knot. He then moves to the next strand over, moving around the bundle in the direction he passes the loops. Tying the first strand around the bundle is straightforward, but each subsequent end must be passed through the previously-formed loops in order to contain all of the other strands in its loop. When tightening, it may help to roll the knot along the bundle, especially when using only two strands. The final effect is a spiral knot vaguely resembling a section of a barber's pole.

The film was never released to theaters, and therefore not seen by a wide audience until 2000 (71 years later) on Cartoon Network's television special Toonheads: The Lost Cartoons. The film was produced in May 1929 and directed by Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising. Plot Rudolf Ising is thinking of ideas for a new character, until he draws a blackfaced person with an ink pen, who comes to life. Ising then talks to the character, and then asks his name. The new character introduces himself as Bosko. Ising tells Bosko to show what he can do. Bosko starts to tap dance, whistle, and sing. After dancing, Bosko looks directly to the screen. Bosko asks, \\"Who's all them folks out there in the dark?\\" Ising tells Bosko that they are the audience, and asks him if he can make them laugh; Bosko agrees to try. Bosko asks Ising if he can draw a piano; Ising does so. Bosko starts to press some piano keys. When one of the keys near the upper end of the keyboard produces a low note, Bosko removes the key and puts it in its proper place near the left end of the keyboard. Bosko hits more random notes, then plays a glissando. Bosko laughs, and then sings \\"Sonny Boy\\", accidentally sliding his tongue out. Bosko opens his hat and pulls his hair, letting his tongue out of his mouth again. He plays another song, singing, which causes his head to pop out like a slinky. After that, Bosko sings again. Ising says this is enough. He sucks Bosko, who also pulls the piano, back into his fountain pen, and then him back into the ink bottle. Bosko then pops out of the ink bottle and promises to return. Production In 1928, when Walt Disney lost control of his Oswald The Lucky Rabbit cartoon series, producer George Winkler hired away several of Disney's animators to continue producing the Oswald cartoons for Universal Studios. These animators included Hugh Harman, Rudolf Ising, Isadore \\"Friz\\" Freleng, Carman \\"Max\\" Maxwell, Norm Blackburn, Paul Smith, and Rollin \\"Ham\\" Hamilton. The Winkler Oswald shorts were not as successful and in 1929, Universal chose to directly produce the series, establishing its own in-house cartoon studio headed by Walter Lantz, leaving Winkler's animators out of work. The unemployed animators, led by Harman and Ising, decided to produce their own cartoons and made Bosko, The Talk-Ink Kid as a demonstration to show to distributors, using a character the two cartoonists had created and copyrighted in 1927‚Äì28, while still working with Disney. Rudolf Ising appeared on-screen as himself in the short and Carman Maxwell performed the voice of Bosko. Harman and Ising shopped for a distributor, but were turned down by both Paramount Pictures and Universal. Leon Schlesinger, head of Pacific Title & Art Studio took an interest in Bosko and used his connections with Warner Bros. to get a distribution deal for a cartoon series that Harman and Ising later named Looney Tunes, a play on the name of Walt Disney's Silly Symphony series. The cartoon pioneered the pre-synch technique, now standard in American animation, as Harman and Ising understood the shortcomings of recording the sound after the animation in relation to dialogue. Apparently, the entire soundtrack was filmed on the spot, with Maxwell being off-camera. According to cartoon historian Mark Kausler, a camera pointed at Maxwell's mouth to provide reference for the animation, but it was finally determined it wasn't necessary and that it looked \\"too forced\\". Availability Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid is available on disc 4 of the DVD set Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1 and disc 3 of the Blu-ray set Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 2. Preservation The short was considered lost for many decades, with only the film's Vitaphone soundtrack still in existence. By the late 1950s, when the film was being sold in a package on television, it was transferred into 16mm film by Associated Artists Productions in 1956 and was shown on television. 1957 MOVIES FROM AAP Warner Bros Features & Cartoons SALES BOOK DIRECTED AT TV Turner Entertainment Co. had a 35mm copy, but did not acknowledge its existence until 1999.

It extends from US 41 in Miami, Florida to US 25W in Rocky Top, Tennessee. Between its termini, US 441 travels through the states of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. The highway acts as a connector between several major urban areas, including Miami, Orlando, Ocala, Gainesville, Athens, and Knoxville. It also crosses the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where it meets the southwestern end of the Blue Ridge Parkway, and where no trucks or other commercial traffic are allowed. Route description Miami =Florida= US 441 begins northbound at Southwest 7th Street, which is westbound U.S. Route 41, and ends southbound on Southwest 8th Street, which is eastbound U.S. Route 41 in the eastern \\"Little Havana\\" neighborhood of downtown Miami (both are one-way streets). 441 runs along SW/NW 8th Ave. till it crosses the Miami River; then it runs along NW 7th Ave. till the Golden Glades interchange; then it runs along NW 2nd Ave. till the Miami-Dade/Broward county line. The route parallels Interstate 95 north out of Miami to western Aventura, where I-95 heads northeast to access Fort Lauderdale and the remainder of the eastern Florida coast. However, the route soon approaches the tolled Florida's Turnpike, which parallels US 441 north to West Palm Beach. In between, the route interchanges with the Turnpike at exit 62 via State Road 870 (Commercial Boulevard) in Tamarac. Additionally, US 441 meets Interstate 595 (Exits 8 and 8B) west of Fort Lauderdale and the tolled State Road 869 (the Sawgrass Expressway) in Coconut Creek. At West Palm Beach, US 441 intersects U.S. Route 98 and overlaps the highway to central Palm Beach County, where the two routes split. US 441 continues west to the eastern shore of Lake Okeechobee, where it turns north to follow the shoreline to Pahokee. Just north of Pahokee, US 98 rejoins US 441 and remains concurrent with US 441 along the eastern edge of the lake. North of Lake Okeechobee in Okeechobee, US 98 and US 441 split for the final time. US 441 continues north, meeting the Turnpike at Yeehaw Junction (via State Road 60) prior to intersecting U.S. Route 192 at Holopaw. US 441 turns west onto US 192, forming an overlap into Kissimmee. At the concurrent routes of U.S. Route 17/92, US 441 separates from US 192 and follows US 17 / US 92 north into downtown Orlando. In downtown, US 17 / US 92 turns east onto State Road 50 while US 441 continues north on the Orange Blossom Trail. North of downtown, US 441 crosses the tolled State Road 429 and western terminus of State Road 414 in Apopka before leaving the Orlando area. In Leesburg, midway between Orlando and Ocala, US 441 intersects U.S. Route 27. Here, the routes come together, creating a concurrency north to the Ocala suburb of Belleview, where US 27 and US 441 intersect U.S. Route 301. US 301 turns north onto US 27 / US 441, overlapping the routes into Ocala. Immediately north of downtown, US 27 separates from US 441; US 301 then departs the route north of the city. US 441 continues to the northwest, passing across Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park, through Gainesville and interchanging with Interstate 75(Exit 399) ahead of an intersection with US 41 in High Springs. US 441 joins US 41 north to Lake City, where the routes split south of the city. The routes remain parallel, however, past U.S. Route 90 to the northern extents of Lake City. Past Lake City, US 441 interchanges with Interstate 10 (Exit 303), then skirts the western edge of the Okefenokee Swamp as it enters Georgia. The section from Miami to West Palm Beach is paired with mostly-unsigned State Road 7; many locals in this area generally call US 441 as \\"State Road 7\\" instead of US 441\\\\. The section from Holopaw to Ocala is paired with unsigned State Road 500. From SR 121 in Gainesville to US 90 in Lake City, it is part of the DeSoto Trail. =Georgia= U.S. Route 441 north of Commerce, Georgia, near the interchange with Interstate 85 In Georgia, US 441 continues to bypass the Okefenokee Swamp to Edith, where it turns to the northwest toward the interior of the state. In Homerville, US 441 intersects U.S. Route 84, then meets and merges with U.S. Route 221 south of Pearson. The routes remain concurrent to Douglas, where US 221 and US 441 split. Farther north, US 441 intersects U.S. Route 319 south of Jacksonville. US 319 turns north onto US 441, creating an overlap north to McRae. US 319 and US 441 intersect U.S. Route 280, which joins the routes for a concurrent run through McRae. In the center of McRae, US 280, US 319 and US 441 meet the concurrent routes of U.S. Route 23 and U.S. Route 341. North of the city, US 280 splits off while US 319 and US 441 then pass Little Ocmulgee State Park before continuing concurrently to Dublin. Just south of Dublin, US 319 and US 441 interchange with Interstate 16. In Dublin, US 441 splits from US 319 onto a new bypass. On the bypass, US 441 intersects with U.S. Route 80. North of Dublin, US 441 passes through Milledgeville prior to meeting U.S. Route 129 near Eatonton. US 129 and US 441 continue concurrently through Madison (where US 129 and US 441 interchange with Interstate 20) and U.S. Route 278 to Athens, where US 129 and US 441 turn eastward onto a limited-access beltway encircling the city. On the beltway, US 129 and US 441 run concurrent with U.S. Route 29 and, for a stretch, U.S. Route 78 to an interchange northeast of the city. Here, US 29 exits the highway while US 441 remains on the beltway for two more exits before departing. The route proceeds north to Commerce, where it interchanges with Interstate 85 north of the city. Past Commerce, US 441 continues to Cornelia, where it intersects U.S. Route 23. US 441 merges with US 23, remaining concurrent with the route through Clayton (where US 23 and US 441 are concurrent with U.S. Route 76 for a short distance) into North Carolina. The portion of US 23 / US 441 from U.S. Route 123 west of Toccoa to the North Carolina state line is located within the Chattahoochee National Forest. From the Florida state line to Pearson (in Echols, Clinch and Atkinson counties), Georgia State Route 89 is concurrent with US 441\\\\. =North Carolina= Upon crossing the state line, US 23 and US 441 enter the Nantahala National Forest. The concurrent routes head north through a pair of small communities before intersecting U.S. Route 64 in Franklin. US 23 and US 441 turn east, briefly overlapping US 64 around Franklin before separating from the route and continuing to the northeast through the forest. At Dillsboro, US 23 and US 441 intersect U.S. Route 74, here a limited-access highway. US 23 and US 441 both merge onto the freeway, becoming concurrent with US 74; however, US 23 follows US 74 east toward Asheville while US 441 utilizes US 74 west. Near Qualla, the overlap with US 74 comes to an end as US 441 departs the freeway as well as the forest. US 441 heads north to Cherokee, a town located within the Eastern Cherokee Indian Reservation, where it briefly overlaps U.S. Route 19 through the town center. Past Cherokee, US 441 progresses north through the reservation to the southern extent of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, a dual-state park situated on the North Carolina-Tennessee border. From the park entrance to the Tennessee state line, the route follows a northwesterly alignment as it traverses the Great Smoky Mountains. =Tennessee= US 441 in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee US 441 enters Tennessee at Newfound Gap. The route heads north through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to Gatlinburg, along the Great Smoky Mountains Parkway, where the route meets U.S. Route 321. US 321 joins US 441 northward through Pigeon Forge before separating north of the city. US 441 continues north to Sevierville, where it intersects with U.S. Route 411. US 441 turns west onto US 411, following the route west to Seymour. Here, US 411 heads to the southwest towards Georgia while US 441 continues northwest to Knoxville. Immediately south of the city, US 441 junctions with State Route 33. SR 33 merges with US 441, following the U.S. route as it enters downtown Knoxville. Within downtown, US 441 interchanges with Interstate 40 and Interstate 640 before exiting the city limits. North of the city at Halls Crossroads, SR 33 breaks from US 441 and heads northeast toward New Tazewell. US 441, meanwhile, turns northwest, paralleling Interstate 75 for a distance before crossing the top of Norris Dam and finally interchanging with the freeway at exit 128 near Rocky Top. The route then terminates at an intersection with U.S. Route 25W just west of I-75 in Rocky Top. The route is paired with unsigned State Route 71 for most of its length in Tennessee. History A US 441 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 US 441 was one of the original 1926 US routes. Initially it ran between Orlando and Ocala, Florida. In 1935 it was extended north to High Springs, Florida, and in 1948 to Baldwin, Georgia. The following year the southern end was moved to downtown Miami. In 1952 US 441 reached its final configuration when it was extended north from Baldwin to Rocky Top, Tennessee (then known as Lake City).\\"End of US Highway 441\\" In Florida, where signs for U.S. Highways formerly had different colors for each highway (until the state was forced by the federal government to conform to standards that required consistent black-and-white signs), the shield for US 441 was brown. In 1970 signs denoting US 441 were removed from that portion of the route which runs through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, to discourage commercial vehicles (which are not allowed in the park).

(\\"She could hear the cars roll by/Out on 441/Like waves crashin' on the beach\\") Petty is from Gainesville, Florida and US 441 travels through Gainesville and is the eastern bound of the University of Florida campus. This prompted an urban legend that stated that song was based on a suicide committed on the university campus. US 441 is also mentioned in the song \\"Best of Me\\" by country singer Brantley Gilbert. He sings, \\"I remember it all too well/ Riding 441 down to Milledgeville\\". US 441 is mentioned in the song titled \\"It's Over\\" by the country artist Corey Smith. He sings, \\"Its time to show myself the door/ There's no pretending anymore/ No, it's over/ Where I'm going I don't know/ Somewhere down this dusty road/ North on 441/ Pass the rolling cattle fields, the trailer parks, and rusted cotton mills/ Lord get me out of here.\\" He also released a song in 2020 called \\"Old 441\\" about the highway.

Gigerenzer is director emeritus of the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) at the Max Planck Institute for Human DevelopmentGerd Gigerenzer  Max Planck Institute for Human Development and director of the Harding Center for Risk Literacy,https://www.harding- center.mpg.de/en/team Harding Center for Risk Literacy (Team) both in Berlin, Germany. Gigerenzer investigates how humans make inferences about their world with limited time and knowledge. He proposes that, in an uncertain world, probability theory is not sufficient; people also use smart heuristics, that is, rules of thumb. He conceptualizes rational decisions in terms of the adaptive toolbox (the repertoire of heuristics an individual or institution has) and the ability to choose a good heuristics for the task at hand. A heuristic is called ecologically rational to the degree that it is adapted to the structure of an environment. Gigerenzer argues that heuristics are not irrational or always second-best to optimization, as the accuracy-effort trade-off view assumes, in which heuristics are seen as short-cuts that trade less effort for less accuracy. In contrast, his and associated researchers' studies have identified situations in which \\"less is more\\", that is, where heuristics make more accurate decisions with less effort. This contradicts the traditional view that more information is always better or at least can never hurt if it is free. Less-is-more effects have been shown experimentally, analytically, and by computer simulations. Biography =Academic career= Gigerenzer received his PhD from the University of Munich in 1977 and became a professor of psychology there the same year. In 1984 he moved to the University of Konstanz and in 1990 to the University of Salzburg. From 1992 to 1995 he was Professor of Psychology at the University of Chicago and has been the John M. Olin Distinguished Visiting Professor, School of Law at the University of Virginia. In 1995 he became director of the Max Planck Institute for Psychological Research in Munich. Since 2009 he has been director of the Harding Center for Risk Literacy in Berlin. Gigerenzer was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Basel and the Open University of the Netherlands. He is also Batten Fellow at the Darden Business School, University of Virginia, Fellow of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, and Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. =Heuristics= With Daniel Goldstein he first theorized the recognition heuristic and the take-the-best heuristic. They proved analytically conditions under which semi-ignorance (lack of recognition) can lead to better inferences than with more knowledge. These results were experimentally confirmed in many experiments, e.g., by showing that semi-ignorant people who rely on recognition are as good as or better than the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Rankings and experts at predicting the outcomes of the Wimbledon tennis tournaments. Similarly, decisions by experienced experts (e.g., police, professional burglars, airport security) were found to follow the take-the-best heuristic rather than weight and add all information, while inexperienced students tend to do the latter. A third class of heuristics, Fast-And-Frugal trees, are designed for categorization and are used for instance in emergency units to predict heart attacks, and model bail decisions made by magistrates in London courts. In such cases, the risks are not knowable and professionals hence face uncertainty. To better understand the logic of Fast-And-Frugal trees and other heuristics, Gigerenzer and his colleagues use the strategy of mapping its concepts onto those of well- understood optimization theories, such as signal-detection theory. A critic of the work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, Gigerenzer argues that heuristics should not lead us to conceive of human thinking as riddled with irrational cognitive biases, but rather to conceive rationality as an adaptive tool that is not identical to the rules of formal logic or the probability calculus. He and his collaborators have theoretically and experimentally shown that many cognitive fallacies are better understood as adaptive responses to a world of uncertainty‚Äîsuch as the conjunction fallacy, the base rate fallacy, and overconfidence. =The adaptive toolbox= The basic idea of the adaptive toolbox is that different domains of thought require different specialized cognitive mechanisms instead of one universal strategy. The analysis of the adaptive toolbox and its evolution is descriptive research with the goal of specifying the core cognitive capacities (such as recognition memory) and the heuristics that exploit these (such as the recognition heuristic).Gigerenzer and Selten: Bounded Rationality: The Adaptive Toolbox. 2001. =Risk communication= Alongside his research on heuristics, Gigerenzer investigates risk communication in situations where risks can actually be calculated or precisely estimated. He has developed an ecological approach to risk communication where the key is the match between cognition and the presentation of the information in the environment. For instance, lay people as well as professionals often have problems making Bayesian inferences, typically committing what has been called the base-rate fallacy in the cognitive illusions literature. Gigerenzer and Ulrich Hoffrage were the first to develop and test a representation called natural frequencies, which helps people make Bayesian inferences correctly without any outside help. Later it was shown that with this method, even 4th graders were able to make correct inferences. Once again, the problem is not simply in the human mind, but in the representation of the information. Gigerenzer has taught risk literacy to some 1,000 doctors in their CMU and some 50 US federal judges, and natural frequencies has now entered the vocabulary of evidence-based medicine. In recent years, medical schools around the world have begun to teach tools such as natural frequencies to help young doctors understand test results. Intellectual background Intellectually, Gigerenzer's work is rooted in Herbert Simon's work on satisficing (as opposed to maximizing) and on ecological and evolutionary views of cognition, where adaptive function and success is central, as opposed to logical structure and consistency, although the latter can be means towards function. Gigerenzer and colleagues write of the mid-17th century \\"probabilistic revolution\\", \\"the demise of the dream of certainty and the rise of a calculus of uncertainty ‚Äì probability theory\\". Gigerenzer calls for a second revolution, \\"replacing the image of an omniscient mind computing intricate probabilities and utilities with that of a bounded mind reaching into an adaptive toolbox filled with fast and frugal heuristics\\". These heuristics would equip humans to deal more specifically with the many situations they face in which not all alternatives and probabilities are known, and surprises can happen. Personal Gigerenzer is a jazz and Dixieland musician. He was part of The Munich Beefeaters Dixieland Band which performed in a TV ad for the VW Golf around the time it came out in 1974. The ad can be viewed on YouTube, with Gigerenzer at the steering wheel and on the banjo. He is married to Lorraine Daston, director at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science and has one daughter, Thalia Gigerenzer.

He is also known as professor of Mexican composer Silvestre Revueltas at Chicago Musical College during a period between 1918-1922. Life and career Felix Borowski was of Polish descent but was born in the English village of Burton-in-Kendal, Westmorland. His father, who was quite a musician, was of distinguished Polish stock. His mother was English and very accomplished in music. His father gave him his first instruction on the piano as well as on the violin . He was educated in London and at the Cologne Conservatory. He then taught the piano and the violin for a while in Aberdeen, Scotland. At this time Borowski had begun to publish smaller compositions for piano and violin. Somewhat later his compositions won strong commendation from composers such as Edvard Grieg, Theodor Leschetizky, Sauer and other renowned masters. In 1896, Borowski moved to the USA to become Director of the Chicago Musical College. His connection with this musical college continued until 1925 when he resigned to devote himself to private teaching and to composition. During his working life in the U.S.A. he was a composer, teacher, and newspaper critic in Chicago. He was the programme annotator for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from 1908-1956, and the CSO holds a collection of his original compositions as well as arrangements by him of the works of others. In 1917, he was elected as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity. Compositions One of his compositions for piano and violin ('Adoration') was recorded on Edison Blue Amberol in 1914 (#2475) by Richard Czerwonky (1886-1949), also an American musician of Polish descent, being an outstanding violin-player and orchestra conductor at his time. Borowski wrote three large-scale and romantic Sonatas for the organ (published 1904, 1906 and 1924), and his compositions for orchestra include a poem Semiramis and 3 symphonies (c.1932, c.1933, c.1938).

It runs for from US 64 south of Clifton, Tennessee to an intersection with US 60 in Marion, Kentucky. While it is considered a spur route of U.S. Route 41, the two routes no longer connect. Route description =Tennessee= US 641 begins at an interchange with US 64 south of Clifton. North of that city, it runs concurrently with SR 69. US 641 intersects US 412 in Parsons, I-40 near Holladay, and US 70 in Camden. In Paris, US 641 intersects US 79; it also separates from SR 69 and begins a concurrency with SR 54 that it maintains until the Kentucky state line. =Kentucky= US 641 enters Kentucky at Hazel and continues north to Murray, intersecting KY 80 just north of the city limit. Near Benton, a spur route (Spur US 641) provides access to I-69 (the Purchase Parkway) while the main route travels through the city. US 641 has a concurrency with US 62 beginning near Calvert City; the routes cross I-24 / I-69 before separating in Eddyville. The route intersects KY 70 in Fredonia. The US 641 designation ends at US 60 in Marion. History U.S. Route 641 was created as a highway from Paris, Tennessee to Evansville, Indiana. In 1972, its route was truncated in the north. Its northern section from Marion, Kentucky to Evansville, which was concurrent with U.S. Route 60, was eliminated and its northern terminus has since remained Marion. In 1977, US 641 was extended southward along the path of Tennessee State Route 69 to its interchange with I-40 (Exit 126) near Holladay, Tennessee with SR 69 continuing south beyond the interchange. In November 2014, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved a southern extension of the US 641 designation along SR 69, from the former southern terminus at I-40 to the current end at US 64 in Wayne County.

It was released in North America in April 1985. The player takes the role of a paperboy who delivers a fictional newspaper called \\"The Daily Sun\\" along a suburban street on his bicycle. The arcade version of the game featured bike handlebars as the controller. The game was ported to many home systems beginning in 1986. A sequel for home computers and consoles, Paperboy 2, was released in 1991. Gameplay Based in the United States, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers along a suburban street. The player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street which is displayed in a cabinet perspective (or oblique projection) view. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers' homes and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber's house. The game begins with a choice of difficulty levels: Easy Street, Middle Road and Hard Way. The object of the game is to perfectly deliver papers to subscribers for an entire week and avoid crashing (which counts as one of the player's lives) before the week ends. The game lasts for seven in-game days, Monday through Sunday. Controlling the paperboy with the handlebar controls, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers. Each day begins by showing an overview of the street indicating subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers and non-subscribers' homes are also easy to discern in the level itself, with subscribers living in brightly colored houses, and non-subscribers living in dark houses. The player scores points for each paper delivered successfully, and more points if they throw it into the mailbox, as well as breakage points by damaging the houses of non- subscribers. A perfect delivery results in all the points being worth double for that day. At the end of each stage is a training course with various obstacles to throw papers at and to jump over, and the player scores a bonus for finishing the course. Crashing on the course ends the round, but does not cost the player a life. When a player fails to deliver a paper to a house, the resident will cancel their subscription, and the house turns dark. Doing a perfect delivery can gain back subscribers previously lost. Development The cabinet of this game is a standard upright but with custom controls. The controls consist of a bicycle handlebar (a modified Star Wars yoke) with one button on each side, used to throw papers. The handlebars can be pushed forward to accelerate and pulled back to brake. The game runs on the Atari System 2 hardware. The CPU is a 10 MHz Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) T-11. For sound and coin inputs, it uses a 2.2 MHz MOS Technology 6502. The sound chips are two POKEYs for digital sound, a Yamaha YM2151 for music, and a Texas Instruments TMS5220 for speech. The protection chip is a Slapstic model 137412-105. The game program code for the arcade version was written in BLISS. Ports and re-releases Home ports started appearing in 1986. In some of these versions, the player can assume the role of a papergirl instead of a paperboy. Paperboy was ported to the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron by Andy Williams in 1986. Versions for the Amstrad CPC, Apple II, and TRS-80 Color Computer were also released in 1986. Elite Systems produced versions for the ZX Spectrum and the Commodore 64. The ZX Spectrum version had been released in the United Kingdom by October 1986, and the Commodore 64 version was published there by February 1987. Elite created versions for the Commodore 16 and Commodore Plus/4 later that year. A version for the Apple IIGS was released in 1988. In the United States, a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version was developed by Tengen and published by Mindscape in December 1988. The NES version is particularly notable for being the first NES game developed in the United States. In October 1989, Elite released versions for the Atari ST and PC in the United Kingdom, followed by an Amiga version later that month. The game was released for the Famicom by Altron in January 1991. In the United Kingdom, a Game Boy version by Mindscape was released in October or November 1990. A Master System version, by Sega and U.S. Gold, was released in the United Kingdom in November 1990. Atari released a version of Paperboy for the Atari Lynx in 1990. By March 1991, an NES version by Mindscape had been released in the United Kingdom. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Paperboy on their November 1, 1985 issue as being the fifth most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. In 2007, Spanner Spencer of Eurogamer rated the arcade version 9 out of 10 and praised its gameplay, graphics, and music. Advanced Computer Entertainment (ACE) offered praise for the Atari ST version, awarding it a score of 850 out of 1,000, while Zero gave it a score of 86 out of 100. ACE and Zero noted that the Atari ST version looked and played like the arcade version. Computer Gamer gave the ZX Spectrum version a rating of 16 out of 20, considering it to be a faithful conversion of the arcade game, while noting that some people may find the gameplay to be repetitive. For the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC versions, ACE gave the game a rating of 5 out of 5, noting the \\"extremely well executed\\" graphics and referring to the game as a \\"budget classic.\\" U.K. magazine Computer and Video Games (CVG) gave the Commodore 64 version a 52 percent rating, criticizing its music and \\"blocky and ill-proportioned\\" sprites; the magazine gave the ZX Spectrum version an 83 percent rating. Ken McMahon of Commodore User reviewed the Commodore 16 and Commodore Plus/4 version and rated it 6 out of 10, noting that it was too easy. Crash gave the ZX Spectrum version an 88% rating with the general rating \\"Another slick, playable conversion from Elite\\", while Zzap!64 was less enthusiastic for the Commodore 64 version giving it 44%. In 1993, Zzap!64 rated the Commodore 64 version a 60 percent score, calling it repetitive. Richard Leadbetter of CVG reviewed the Lynx version and stated, \\"Looks good, but simply isn't enough fun to play.\\" STarts Clayton Walnum similarly praised the Lynx version's graphics and sound effects but deemed the game \\"just another shoot-em-up without the shooting.\\" Raze offered praise for the clear and colorful graphics of the Lynx version, but stated that the game \\"is too old and tired for the exciting and new Lynx.\\" AllGame's Kyle Knight criticized the Lynx version for its simple sound effects and music, as well as its repetitive gameplay. Leadbetter praised the Master System version, calling it \\"one of the best arcade conversions\\" available for the system, while noting that the game's only \\"slight downer\\" was the music. Mean Machines praised the Master System version for its graphics and similarities to the arcade game, while Raze wrote a mixed review for the Master System version. Mean Machines was critical of the NES version for its graphics, sound, and controls, and concluded that it was, \\"A highly offensive product which weighs in as a sadly derisive conversion of a classic coin-op.\\" Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame stated that Mindscape did a good job of porting the game to the NES. Weiss praised the controls and sound effects of the NES version, but criticized the music. Raze considered the Game Boy version to be \\"Excellent\\", while Mean Machines criticized its controls, blurry scrolling, and the lack of colorful graphics, which could not be produced by the system. ACE noted slightly difficult controls and poor sound effects for the Game Boy version. The One gave the Amiga version 80% stating that \\"it's an almost flawless conversion\\" of the arcade game. ACE gave the Amiga version a rating of 878, calling it a perfect conversion of the arcade game. Tony Dillon of Commodore User gave the Amiga version an 83 percent rating and considered it to be nearly identical to the arcade version. Gordon Houghton of CVG gave the Amiga version a 69 percent rating, stating that the sound was \\"arguably better\\" than the arcade version, but noting that the graphics were \\"jerky\\" and that the gameplay had been altered from the arcade version. Houghton concluded that it was \\"not a bad game, but it's too old and too expensive to deserve greater praise.\\" Compute! praised the music and graphics of the Amiga version, but considered the gameplay to be outdated and repetitive. Robert A. Jung of IGN reviewed the Lynx version in 1999, and considered it to be a \\"decent\\" adaptation of the arcade game. Jung noted the game's \\"average-quality\\" graphics and sound, and concluded, \\"Not a bad game, though not one of the Lynx's best.\\" IGN's Craig Harris reviewed a Game Boy Color version and stated that it \\"is definitely the worst rendition of the game, even beating out the Atari Lynx's waterdown port of the arcade game.\\" Harris criticized the game's music, the lack of speech audio from the original game, poor collision detection, and a lack of fun. Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame praised the Game Boy Color version for its colorful graphics, but noted that the game did not introduce any new changes from the original arcade version, writing, \\"Those expecting a lot of changes or additions will be disappointed.\\" =Re-releases= Versions of Paperboy were re-released for the Nintendo 64, Xbox 360 and iPhone and iPod Touch. Dean Austin of IGN criticized the retro 3D look of the Nintendo 64 version, but praised the gameplay and considered it to be a \\"great game.\\" Daniel Erickson of Daily Radar criticized the \\"bland\\" and \\"repetitive\\" gameplay of the Nintendo 64 version. Robert Amsbury of Game Revolution praised the sound effects in the Nintendo 64 version, but considered the music to be repetitive, while noting that the game \\"isn't really all that fun.\\" Weiss criticized the Nintendo 64 version for its music and sound effects, as well as poor controls, and wrote that the game had \\"some of the ugliest graphics you'll find in a Nintendo 64 cartridge.\\" Ben Stahl of GameSpot noted the outdated sound effects used in the Nintendo 64 version, and stated, \\"While a decent game on its own, Paper Boy 64 doesn't capture the magic of the original arcade game.\\" IGN's Levi Buchanan, reviewing a cell phone version, praised the controls and stated that the game looked and played like the original arcade game. According to Metacritic, the Xbox 360 version received \\"Mixed or average reviews.\\" TeamXbox gave the Xbox 360 version an overall score of 8.2, stating that \\"Paperboy \\"delivers\\" as advertised in the classifieds.\\" Greg Sewart of GamesRadar considered the Xbox 360 version to be an \\"authentic recreation\\" of the arcade version, but noted that the game, like previous versions, suffers from imprecise controls due to the absence of the arcade game's handlebar controller. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot reviewed the Xbox 360 re-release and was disappointed by the lack of new sound effects and music, as well as the lack of graphical updates. Gerstmann stated that the game would most likely appeal to people who \\"have fond memories\\" of the original arcade game. IGN's Erik Brudvig, reviewing the Xbox 360 version, considered the game to be a limited amount of fun. Brudvig noted the lack of a handlebar controller and stated that, \\"Thanks to the isometric view, this version of Paperboy suffers from the same wonky controls that every home version of the game has.\\" Kristan Reed of Eurogamer praised the Xbox 360 re-release for its controls and noted that the game \\"stands up pretty well\\" despite its age, although he stated that the game quickly becomes repetitive. Corey Cohen of Official Xbox Magazine praised the Xbox 360 version for its music and controls, and noted that it was as appealing as the arcade version. Tarryn van der Byl of Pocket Gamer criticized the iPhone version for its poor controls, and stated that the game's optional 3D graphics mode was \\"ugly and feels clumsy and inaccurate.\\" Slide to Play considered the iPhone/iPod version a \\"mixed bag\\", but praised the gameplay. Mark Langshaw of Digital Spy reviewed the iPhone version and stated that it would likely appeal most to fans of the original game. Langshaw concluded, \\"As far as nostalgic remakes go, Paperboy delivers but doesn't quite do enough to make the front page.\\" According to Metacritic, Paperboy: Special Delivery has a score of 55 out of 100, indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews.\\" Blake Patterson of TouchArcade considered Paperboy: Special Delivery to be an improvement over Elite's iPhone version, praising the improved controls and graphics. Jon Mundy of Pocket Gamer rated the game 5 out of 10, criticizing the gameplay and controls, and writing that the biggest flaw \\"is the game's technical shortcomings. The graphics are extremely basic and yet the game paused and stuttered repeatedly on my second-generation iPod touch.\\" Andrew Nesvadba of AppSpy rated the game 3 out of 5, praising the updated graphics while criticizing the controls. Nesvadba also praised the addition of a story mode, but criticized its short length. Jeremiah Leif Johnson of Gamezebo gave the game three stars out of five, praising the story mode and the 1980s-style graphics, but criticizing the poor controls. Legacy A sequel, Paperboy 2, was released in 1991 for several home systems. Paperboy, in its original arcade form, is included in the 1998 PlayStation video game Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 2. The Game Boy Color version, developed by Digital Eclipse Software and published by Midway Games, was released in the United States on May 30, 1999. By July 1997, developer High Voltage Software had begun conceptual development of the Nintendo 64 version and was searching for a game publisher, with a possible release in 1998. In August 1998, Midway Games announced that it would be publishing the Nintendo 64 game, which was still in conceptual stages and was expected for release in late 1999. The game was developed using a 3D polygonal game engine, and was released in the United States on October 26, 1999. In May 2000, Midway announced plans to release Paperboy for the PlayStation later that year, although the game was never released. Paperboy was later included in the 2003 video game Midway Arcade Treasures, a compilation of arcade games for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows. In 2005, Paperboy was included in the compilation Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable. In May 2005, Sega Mobile announced that it would release Paperboy for mobile phones. The game was released in May 2006. The Xbox 360 version of Paperboy was released on February 14, 2007 on Xbox Live Arcade; however, the game was removed by 2010. The iPhone/iPod Touch version was released through the App Store on December 18, 2009. The game was developed by Vivid Games and published by Elite Systems. Elite removed the game from the App Store in March 2010, because of a licensing conflict. Glu Mobile developed and published a new iPhone/iPod Touch version, titled Paperboy: Special Delivery, on November 4, 2010. The game included a 20-level story mode in which the paperboy is saving money from his job to buy a new game console, but he later falls in love and throws roses instead of newspapers. The game also featured an optional tilt-based control mode in which the iPhone is tilted to control the paperboy. A port of Paperboy can be accessed in the 2015 video game Lego Dimensions by using the Arcade Dock in the level \\"Painting the Town Black\\". =In other media= Along with Hyper Sports, Paperboy formed one of the computer game rounds in a children's television quiz, First Class, shown on BBC in the 1980s. The paperboy makes a cameo appearance in the 2012 Disney animated film Wreck-It Ralph. The paperboy also makes an appearance in the 2015 film Pixels.

Maintained within a park by Ohio History Connection, it has been designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Department of Interior. The Serpent Mound of Ohio was first reported from surveys by Ephraim Squire and Edwin Davis in their historic volume Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, published in 1848 by the newly founded Smithsonian Museum. The Serpent Mound is the largest serpent effigy in the world.\\"Serpent Mound\\", MNSU (dead link) Description Ohio historical marker Including all three parts, the Serpent Mound extends about , varies in height from less than a foot to more than three feet (30‚Äì100 cm), and has a width of 20 to 25 feet. Conforming to the curve of the land on which it rests, with its head approaching a cliff above a stream, the serpent winds back and forth for more than eight hundred feet and seven coils, and ends in a triple-coiled tail. The shape itself consisted mostly of a layer of yellowish clay and ash that was reinforced with a layer of rocks, and then covered with a layer of soil. The serpent head has an open mouth extending around the east end of a -long hollow oval feature that may represent the snake eating an egg,Landis, Don. \\"Monuments, Mounds, Pyramids...\\" The Genius of Ancient Man: Evolution's Nightmare. Green Forest, AR: Master, 2012. 67. Print. though some scholars posit that the oval feature symbolizes the sun, the body of a frog, or merely the remnant of a platform. The effigy's extreme western feature is a triangular mound approximately at its base and long axis. There are similar serpent effigies in Ontario and Scotland. Origin Archaeologists are still debating the origin of Serpent Mound. The mound contains no artifacts and no burials that would help establish the age of the mound. The two leading theories are that the mound was built by either Adena Culture (800 BC to 100 AD) around 320 BC, or Fort Ancient Culture (1000 to 1750 AD) around 1070 AD. Archaeologist began attributing the mound to the Fort Ancient culture (circa 1070 AD) with the publication of \\"Serpent Mound: A Fort Ancient Icon?\\" in 1996. A 2017 article, \\"Radiocarbon Dates Reveal Serpent Mound Is More than Two Thousand Years Old\\", argues for a construction by the Adena culture circa 320 BC. The academic debate continues with multiple rebutals to each theory published in the Journal of Archaeology. =Adena culture= Historically, researchers first attributed the mound to the Adena culture (1000 BC - 100 AD). William Webb, noted Adena exponent, found evidence through carbon dating for Kentucky Adena as early as 1200 BC. As there are Adena graves near the Serpent Mound, scholars thought the same people constructed the mound. The skeletal remains of the Adena type uncovered in the 1880s at Serpent Mound indicate that these people were unique among the ancient Ohio Valley peoples. An eight-member team led by archaeologist William F Romain has been published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. The team found much older charcoal samples in less- damaged sections of the mound. The investigators conjecture that the mound was originally built between 381 BC and 44 BC, with a mean date of 321 BC. They explain the more recent charcoal found in the 1990s as likely the result of a \\"repair\\" effort by indigenous people around 1070 AD, when the mound would already have been suffering from natural degradation. =Fort Ancient culture= Squier and Davis's map from Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, published by the Smithsonian Institution Press in 1848 In 1996 the team of Robert V. Fletcher and Terry L. Cameron (under the supervision of the Ohio Historical Society's Bradley T. Lepper) reopened a trench created by Frederic Ward Putnam of Harvard over 100 years before. They found a few pieces of charcoal in what was believed to be an undisturbed portion of the Serpent Mound. However, bioturbation, including burrowing animals, frost cracks, etc., can reverse the structural timeline of an earthen mound such as Serpent Mound. It can shift carbon left by a later culture on the surface to areas deep within the structure, making the earthwork appear younger. When the team conducted carbon dating studies on the charcoal pieces, two yielded a date of ca. 1070 AD, with the third piece dating to the Late Archaic period some two thousand years earlier, specifically 2920+/-65 years BP (before the present). The third date, ca. 2900 BP, was recovered from a core sample below cultural modification level. The first two dates place the Serpent Mound within the realm of the Fort Ancient culture. The third dates the mound back to very early Adena culture or before.\\"Serpent Mound: A Fort Ancient Icon?\\", Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 21, No.1, University of Iowa, 1996 The Fort Ancient people could have been the builders of the Serpent Mound. Alternatively, they may have refurbished the earthwork for their own use in the same way that people today fix up old houses to make them suitable for occupation again. The rattlesnake is significant as a symbol in the Mississippian culture, which would help explain the image of the mound. However, there is no sign or indication of a rattle. If this mound was built by the Fort Ancient people, it was uncharacteristic for that group. For example, the mound does not contain artifacts, although, like the Adena people, the Fort Ancient culture typically buried many artifacts in its mounds. In another difference, the Fort Ancient people did not usually bury their dead in the manner of the burials found in proximity to the effigy. One of the only other effigy mounds in Ohio, the Alligator Effigy Mound in Granville, was carbon dated to the Fort Ancient period. Purpose =Astronomical significance= The spiral tail at the end of the Serpent Mound In 1987 Clark and Marjorie Hardman published their finding that the oval-to-head area of the serpent is aligned to the summer solstice sunset.Clark and Marjorie Hardman, Ohio Archaeologist 37(3):34-40 (1987)Glotzhober and Lepper, Serpent Mound: Ohio's Enigmatic Effigy Mound, Ohio Historical Society, Columbus, Ohio, 1994 p. 11 William F. Romain has suggested an array of lunar alignments based on the curves in the effigy's body. Fletcher and Cameron argued convincingly for the Serpent Mound's coils being aligned to the two solstice and two equinox events each year. If the Serpent Mound were designed to sight both solar and lunar arrays, it would be significant as the consolidation of astronomical knowledge into a single symbol. The head of the serpent is aligned to the summer solstice sunset and the coils also may point to the winter solstice sunrise and the equinox sunrise. A depiction of the serpent mound that appeared in The Century periodical in April 1890, drawn by William Jacob Baer. If 1070 AD is accurate as the construction year, building the mound could theoretically have been influenced by two astronomical events: the light from the supernova that created the Crab Nebula in 1054, and the appearance of Halley's Comet in 1066. The supernova light would have been visible for two weeks after it first reached earth, even during the day. The Halley's Comet's tail has always appeared as a long, straight line and does not resemble the curves of the Serpent Mound. Halley's comet appears every 76 years. Numerous other supernovas may have occurred over the centuries that span the possible construction dates of the effigy. Serpent Mound Impact structure The mound is located on the site of a classic astrobleme, an ancient meteorite impact structure. One of the strongest clues to the impact origin of this structure is in the pattern of disruption of sedimentary strata. In the center of the structure, strata have been uplifted several hundred feet, in much the same way that the central uplifts of lunar craters such as Copernicus were formed. In 2003 geologists from Ohio State University and the University of Glasgow (Scotland) corroborated the meteorite impact origin of the structure at Serpent Mound. They had studied core samples collected at the site in the 1970s. Further analyses of the rock core samples indicated the impact occurred during the Permian Period, about 248 to 286 million years ago; thus, the topographic expression of this impact, an impact crater, has been completely erased by erosion.\\"Subsurface Geology of the Serpent Mound Disturbance of Adams, Highland, and Pike Counties, Ohio.\\" Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological Survey. PDF (accessed 10 April 2007) Recent history The Serpent Mound was first mapped by Euro-Americans as early as 1815. In 1846 it was surveyed for the Smithsonian Institution by two Chillicothe men, Ephraim G. Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis. Their book Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley (1848), published by the Smithsonian, included a detailed description and map of the serpent mound. Preservation Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley fascinated many across the country, including Frederic Ward Putnam of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University. Putnam spent much of his career lecturing and publishing on the Ohio mounds, specifically the Serpent Mound. When he visited the Midwest in 1885, he found that plowing and development were destroying many of the mounds. In 1886, with help from a group of wealthy women in Boston (such as the noted Glass Flowers' patroness Mary Lee Ware),Mary L. Ware and the Early Funding of Harvard Anthropology: Private Sources of Funding in the Nineteenth Century (Paper); D. Wes Beattie - http://eraven.franklinpierce.edu/academicshowcase/2017/marulli.htm Putnam raised funds to purchase at the Serpent Mound site for preservation. The purchase also contained three conical mounds, a village site and a burial place.Ralph W. Dexter, \\"Contributions of Frederic Ward Putnam to Ohio Archaeology\\", The Ohio Journal of Science 65(3): 110, May, 1965 Serpent Mound is listed as a \\"Great Wonder Of the Ancient World\\" by National Geographic Magazine. Originally purchased on behalf of the Trustees of the Peabody Museum, in 1900 the land and its ownership were granted to the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society (a predecessor of the present Ohio Historical Society). The Ohio Historical Society designated the Arc of Appalachia Preserves system, a project of Highlands Sanctuary, Inc., as the managing agency of Serpent Mound Following an instance of vandalism in 2015, more security cameras and protective gates were added.\\"Man who took joyride at Serpent Mound sentenced\\", Carrie Blackmore Smith. Cincinnati Enquirer. November 6, 2016. Retrieved 9 jan 2017\\"Man faces felony charges after Serpent Mound Park vandalism\\", Brian Hamrick. WLWT5. July 15, 2015. Retrieved 9 jan 2017 =Excavation= Hopewell pipe, points, and earspool on display at Serpent Mound Gorgets and points from the Adena culture, found at Serpent Mound After raising sufficient funds, in 1886 Putnam returned to the same site. He worked for four years excavating the contents and burial sequences of both the Serpent Mound and two nearby conical mounds. After his work was completed and his findings documented, Putnam worked on restoring the mounds to their original state. One of the conical mounds that was excavated by Putnam (1890) yielded a principal burial which has grave goods that associate it with the Adena period (800 BC-100 BC). He also found and excavated nine intrusive burials in the mound. Additionally, Putnam discovered an ash bed north of the conical mound that contained many prehistoric artifacts. After the excavation, the conical mound was reconstructed and is today standing south of the parking lot at Serpent Mound State Memorial. In 2011, excavations were undertaken prior to installation of utility lines at Serpent Mound State Memorial. The excavations focused on three sides of the conical mound that Putnam (1890) had excavated. In addition to concentrations of artifacts, an ashy soil horizon was excavated north of the conical mound. The ashy soil horizon had prehistoric artifacts associated with them. It is believed that the ashy deposit is a remnant of the ash bed that Putnam (1890) excavated. Wood charcoal from within the remnant ash bed was carbon dated to 1041-1211 AD, the Fort Ancient period. Because the burials in the conical mound dated to the Early Woodland period, the Fort Ancient period dating of the remnant ash bed is suggestive of ritual reuse of the circum mound area. =Serpent Mound Museum= GIS map of Ohio's Great Serpent Mound, created by Timothy A. Price and Nichole I. Stump in March 2002 In 1901 the Ohio Historical Society hired engineer Clinton Cowan to survey newly acquired lands. Cowan created a 56 by map that depicted the outline of the Serpent Mound in relation to nearby landmarks, such as rivers. Cowan also made specific geographical surveys of the area, and he discovered the unique astrobleme on which the mound is based. He found that the mound is at the convergence of three distinctly different soil types. Cowan's information, in conjunction with Putnam's archaeological discoveries, has been the basis for all modern investigations of the Serpent Mound. In 1967, the Ohio Historical Society opened the Serpent Mound Museum, built near the mound. A pathway was constructed around the base of the mound to help visitors. The museum features exhibits that include interpretations of the effigy's form, description of the processes of constructing the mound, the geographical history of the area, and an exhibit on the Adena culture, historically credited as the creators of the mound. Serpent Mound State Memorial is currently being operated on behalf of the Ohio Historical Society by the Arc of Appalachia Preserve System. It is a non-profit organization specializing in the preservation and protection of native biodiversity and prehistoric aboriginal sites in southern Ohio.

As a result, IL 39 and IL 91 were decommissioned. Not only that, IL 16, IL 80, and IL 121 were truncated. In 1954, a portion of US 150 in Peoria moved from the Franklin Street Bridge to the McClugage Bridge. As a result, US 150 City, later US 150 Bus., appeared in Peoria from 1954 to 1964. In 1976, the decision to truncate US 150 from US 67 in Rock Island to US 6 near the Quad City Airport was approved. =Indiana= Initially, US 150 ran from Shoals, Indiana to Louisville, Kentucky. In 1936, US 150 extended due northwest from Shoals to the Quad Cities in Illinois. This caused IN 46 to cut back from the Illinois state line to Terre Haute. =Kentucky= U.S. Route 168 was created in 1926 from Louisville to Mount Vernon, Kentucky, overlapping US 68 between Bardstown and Perryville.

Tourism and hospitality have always thrived, Milnthorpe being a convenient stop-off point on the A6 for coaches and cars en route to the Lake District. Just to the north is Levens Hall, famed for its topiary. The village used to be a major traffic bottleneck before the opening of the M6 motorway in 1970, and the A590/A591 Kendal link road a few years later. The nearby Dallam Deer park, part of the wider Dallam Tower Estate, is now a popular spot for walkers, particularly those en route to the Arnside and Silverdale AONB. Big Fish Internet was Britain's first Website Design Company formed in early 1996. Started in Milnthorpe and now moved to larger offices a few miles away in Sandside. Duralon Combs is the oldest Comb manufacturer in the UK has been in Milnthorpe for over 300 years. The popular children's drink Um Bongo was made in Milnthorpe by Libby's in the 1980s. Community Each August, the Friends of the Exhibition holds its annual art exhibition in the church. Milnthorpe has two steel bands, one for adults and the other based in the town's junior school. The grade I listed house Dallam Tower, with an estate known for its deer, stands near to the River Bela just south-west of Milnthorpe, whilst St Anthony's Tower may be seen on the top of St Anthony's Hill to the north-east of the town centre, overlooking the village and the housing estate of Owlet Ash Fields in nearby Ackenthwaite. It has one secondary school, called Dallam School, and one primary school, called Milnthorpe Primary School. There are three public houses in the village. People The former Leader of the Liberal Democrats (2015‚Äì17), Tim Farron (MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale) lives in Milnthorpe. John Taylor, third president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1880‚Äì87, was born in Milnthorpe and lived there until he emigrated to Canada.

It currently runs for from Richmond, Virginia to Sandusky, Ohio. It passes through the states of Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio. It goes through the cities of Richmond, Charlottesville, Staunton, and Waynesboro, Virginia; and Wheeling, West Virginia. West of Pruntytown, West Virginia, US 250 intersects and forms a short overlap with its parent US 50. In Virginia and Ohio, the route is signed east-west. In West Virginia, the route is signed north-south. Route description =Ohio= In Ohio, U.S. 250 is an important cross-state corridor linking Sandusky (on Lake Erie) to Bridgeport (on the Ohio River). From a regional/traffic perspective, the route can roughly be divided into five sections linking major regions and routes of the state: * US 6 in Sandusky to US 20 at Norwalk * US 20 at Norwalk to US 30 at Wooster * US 30 at Wooster to I-77 at Strasburg * I-77 at New Philadelphia to US 22 at Cadiz * US 22 at Cadiz to I-70 at Bridgeport =West Virginia= View north along US 250 in rural northern West Virginia U.S. 250's northern entrance into West Virginia is via the Military Order of the Purple Heart Bridge from Bridgeport, Ohio onto Wheeling Island. It is briefly co- signed with U.S. Route 40. The route additionally co-signs with Interstate 70 and crosses the Ohio River on the Fort Henry Bridge in Wheeling, West Virginia. U.S. Route 250 then exits I-70 east of the Wheeling Tunnel and joins West Virginia Route 2 one mile (1.6 km) later. In Moundsville, West Virginia, the route leaves WV 2 and departs toward Cameron, Mannington, and Fairmont. It intersects with its parent route, U.S. Route 50, two miles west of Grafton in Pruntytown and continues southward, co-signed with U.S. Route 119 for 12 miles. The route moves through Philippi, and finally through Elkins. U.S. Route 250 intersects with U.S. Route 33 and U.S. Route 219 briefly in Elkins, which is the last major hub before U.S. Route 250 winds its way through the Appalachian Mountains to the Virginia border. U.S. 250 in West Virginia includes the Philippi Covered Bridge at Philippi, the only covered bridge on the United States Numbered Highway System. Philippi truck route View south along US 250 Truck in Philippi U.S. Route 250 Truck follows Blue and Gray Expressway around the south and west sides of downtown Philippi, avoiding the covered bridge. =Virginia= US 250 runs from the West Virginia state line near Hightown east to its eastern terminus at US 360 in Richmond. US 250 is the main east-west highway of Highland County, which is known as Virginia's Little Switzerland; the highway follows the path of the 19th century Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike. From Staunton east to Richmond, the U.S. Highway serves as the local complement to Interstate 64 (I-64), roughly following the 18th century Three Notch'd Road through Waynesboro and Charlottesville on its way through the Shenandoah Valley, its crossing of the Blue Ridge Mountains at Rockfish Gap, and the Piedmont. In the Richmond metropolitan area, US 250 is known as Broad Street, a major thoroughfare through the city's West End and downtown areas. History =Earlier roads, funding conflicts= Between Short Pump and Staunton, U.S. 250 largely follows the routing of the Three Notch'd Road (or the Three Chopt Road), which had been established in the Colony of Virginia between Richmond and the Shenandoah Valley by the 1740s. Most likely, the road followed an ancient Monacan trail from Orapax (east of Richmond) to the western Shenandoah Valley. This well-planned route required only one major river crossing, the Rivanna at Charlottesville, with inns or taverns spaced about apart. The route west of Staunton was built about 100 years later as a toll road, the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike. In the second quarter of the 19th century, it became a major gateway into Virginia's \\"Trans- Allegheny\\" region, which presented much greater challenges to transportation than did less rugged portions of the state. In that region, navigable waterways were unavailable and canals impractical. Wheeled vehicles in the form of wagons, and later, motor vehicles needed to pass through with passengers and freight. It became part of the main trade route for salt and other commodities in the early 19th century. As the American Civil War broke out, the route became very important and was defended by Stonewall Jackson's troops at the Battle of McDowell in 1862. The portion of the Staunton- Parkersburg Turnpike west of Allegheny Mountain (almost all of it) became part of West Virginia in 1863. Virginia's pre-War debt became a major issue after the American Civil War, as millions of dollars of debt remained for infrastructure improvements, some of which were now located in the new state of West Virginia, including most of the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike. Political divisions in Virginia on this issue resulted in creation of a new major political group in the late 1870s, the Readjuster Party, a coalition of Democrats, Republicans, and African-Americans seeking a reduction in Virginia's prewar debt by allocating an appropriate portion to the new State of West Virginia. For several decades, Virginia and West Virginia disputed the new state's share of the Virginia government's debt. The issue was finally settled in 1915, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50. The final installment of this sum was paid off in 1939. =U.S. Highway system, numbering= U.S. Route 250 was created in 1928 and was originally routed from U.S. Route 50 in Grafton, West Virginia north/west to U.S. Route 20 in Norwalk, Ohio. In 1932, the route was expanded north/west to Sandusky, Ohio. In 1934, the route was expanded southward and eastward to Richmond, Virginia.

He began his career in his native New York City. At the age of 17 in 1945, he took a job as a copyboy for the Associated Press. After an apprenticeship of eight years, Falls moved to the Detroit bureau of the AP. In Detroit, Falls flourished. He was hired by the Detroit Times in 1956 to cover the Detroit Tigers. He continued on the Tigers' beat with the Detroit Free Press from 1960 to 1978. His final move was to the Detroit News where he was a columnist and eventually Sports Editor. During his career, Falls also had weekly columns in both The Sporting News and The Hockey News. It is said many young writers were so taken by his writing they wanted to become sportswriters. He also kept a statistic on Rocky Colavito during his years as a member of the Detroit Tigers. When Colavito stranded a runner, Falls would give him an RNBI (Run Not Batted In).The Final Season, p.35, Tom Stanton, Thomas Dunne Books, An imprint of St. Martin‚Äôs Press, New York, NY, 2001, This infuriated Colavito and created a tense relationship between the two for several years. Falls won several awards during his career. In 2001, he won the J. G. Taylor Spink Award from the Baseball Hall of Fame. After his retirement in 2003, he was named to the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. Falls died of complications from diabetes and heart failure at age 76 in Detroit.

They speak the Vietnamese language, the most widely spoken Austroasiatic language. They formed 85.32% of the population of Vietnam in the 2019 census, and are officially known as Kinh (ng∆∞·ªùi Kinh) to distinguish them from the myriad other minority ethnic groups within the country. The earliest recorded name for the ancient Vietnamese people is L·∫°c or L·∫°c Vi·ªát. Although the Vietnamese are classified as Southeast Asian, they also belong in the East Asian cultural sphere due to the historical Chinese rule of Vietnam. The Viet are one of the 4 main groups of Vietic speakers in Vietnam, the others being the Muong, Th·ªï and Ch·ª©t.  Terminology In Vietnamese, Kinh and Vi·ªát are used interchangeably to refer Vietnamese people, with Kinh used more in more official contexts; both have Sino-Vietnamese origins (‰∫¨ and Ë∂ä, respectively). Kinh (‰∫¨), meaning \\"metropolis\\", evolved to refer to those living in established population centers in the lowlands, to distinguish them from people living in the highlands. Vi·ªát (Ë∂ä) is a reference to the B√°ch Vi·ªát, a collection of non-Han peoples who lived in southern China and northern Vietnam since ancient times. Origins Written history first refers to the ancient Vietnamese people simply as the L·∫°c or L·∫°c Vi·ªát, and the country of Vietnam as VƒÉn Lang. Archaeological evidence has been found of the ƒê√¥ng S∆°n culture (also known as Lac Society), a culture that existed during the Bronze Age. The Vietnamese or Kinh people are an Austroasiatic people who lived originally in the area of present-day northern Vietnam and southeastern China. From there, several Austroasiatic tribes migrated to other parts of Vietnam, as well as the rest of Southeast Asia and parts of present-day Indonesia and eastern India. Genetic analysis shows that they are a Southern Mongoloid population closely related to other Southeast Asians. In a 2013 book, professor emeritus of history at UCLA in Los Angeles, California, United States, Damodar R. SarDesai claimed that Vietnamese people were thought for a long time to have come from Tibet, more modern hypotheses seem to indicate that today's Vietnamese people are a mixture of northern and southern mongoloid groups, being a mix of the Yue (Viet) people and some Austronesian peoples (see Cham people). According to SarDesai, in around the 3rd century BCE, Viet people moved into the Red River Delta in present-day northern Vietnam, and Tai-speaking people, arriving from the coastal areas of eastern China absorbed, assimilated and influenced the early Vietnamese people.SarDesai, Damodar R.

The Vinmec Medical System‚Äôs research group has revealed initial results of the Vietnamese genome decoding project (2019). Analysing the Vietnamese genome showed the difference of Kinh people to other populations. The interference and gene transfer from East Asian populations to Vietnamese Kinh population is negligible. About one third of the genetic variation in the Kinh population does not occur in the Han Chinese population and vice versa. The data confirms that Kinh and Thai people have high genome homology in genomes and close evolutionary relationships.

Genetic contribution to Koreans Bhak Jong-hwa, a professor in the biomedical engineering department at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), said that the ancient Vietnamese, which was a population that flourished with rapid agricultural development after 8,000 BC, slowly travelled north to ancient civilizations in the Korean Peninsula and the Russian Far East. Bhak said that Korean people were formed from the admixture of agricultural Southern Mongoloids from Vietnam who went through China, hunter-gatherer Northern Mongoloids in the Korean Peninsula and another group of Southern Mongoloids. Bhak said, \\"We believe the number of ancient dwellers who migrated north from Vietnam far exceeds the number of those occupying the peninsula,\\" making Koreans inherit more of their DNA from southerners.Choi, Eun-kyung.

Genome sequencing by Vietnamese researchers Vietnam has a complex history of thousands of years. The fine‚Äêscale genomic analyses of KHV together with populations across Asia elucidated that KHV and other SEA (Southeast Asian) populations mainly derived from the same SEA ancestry. The results from different genomic analyses are generally consistent and support the hypothesis of population migration from Africa to Asia following the South‚Äêto‚ÄêNorth route. Interestingly, they discovered that KHV (Vietnamese from Hanoi) and TAI (Thai from Northern Thailand)Geographical distribution of PanAsian & HapMap samples populations had similar genomic structures and close evolutionary relationships. The findings suggest the usefulness of KHV database for Vietnamese as well as other closely related populations in Asia. Legend and early history According to legend, the first Vietnamese descended from the dragon lord L·∫°c Long Qu√¢n and the female heavenly angel √Çu C∆°. They married and had one hundred eggs, from which hatched one hundred children. Their eldest son ruled as the H√πng king. =First Vietnamese= Historians believe that the earliest Vietnamese people gradually moved from the Indonesian archipelago through the Malay Peninsula and Thailand until they settled on the edges of the Red River in the Tonkin Delta. Archaeologists follow a path of stone tools from the Late Pleistocene across Java, Malaysia, Thailand and north to Myanmar. These stone tools are thought to be the first human tools used in Southeast Asia. Archaeologists believe that at this time the Himalayas, a chain of mountains in northern Myanmar and China, created an icy barrier which isolated the people of Southeast Asia. During the Last Glacial Maximum (25,000-18,000 BCE), ocean levels dropped significantly. This resulted in the exposure of the shallow areas surrounding the coasts and islands of Southeast Asia - today known as the Sunda Shelf. It is generally thought that the exposed Sunda Shelf looked like a giant salt plain, and that perhaps people ventured out across this area to settle on other coasts or islands. Later, when the glaciers melted, the Sunda Shelf again disappeared under water. Because it is a relatively shallow body of water, it has always provided a safe area for traders and travelers in small boats to pass safely without the threat of high or choppy seas. In this way, the geography of the area has had a lot to do with the way in which cultures developed. As the map indicates, outside the Sunda Shelf are deep ocean basins which were not often crossed until heavier and wider Chinese vessels (massive vessels from the Song dynasty (960-1279), which dwarfed later European man-of-war sailing ships) could traverse these deep and sometimes dangerous seas. As the glaciers melted and the seas near these coasts rose, traders and other travelers who wanted to migrate to other areas, or perhaps to proselytize religion, used boats as transport. For the next 4,000 years, until 8000 BCE, people also moved across the mainland of Southeast Asia towards the Tonkin Delta, some stopping and settling along the way. Eventually, the descendants of these migratory peoples entered the Neolithic Age (from around 8000-800 BCE), when humans started to use simple stone tools. Remains of these people and the Hoabinhian culture have been found in the H√≤a B√¨nh Caves along the Red River and in the Tonkin Delta. In the Middle Neolithic Period (2500‚Äì2000 BCE), more people appeared in the area of present-day Vietnam and settled at another location called B·∫Øc S∆°n, in a central area of the Tonkin Delta. These people were probably somewhat taller and lighter-skinned than the Hoabinhian negritos; they excelled in the art of basket weaving as well as in the manufacturing and use of polished double-edged stone tools. =Earlier Vietnamese groups= Map of VƒÉn Lang, 500 BC Sometime after the advent of the societies found at H√≤a B√¨nh and B·∫Øc S∆°n, another group of people developed a culture in what is modern Ngh·ªá An Province, where an aspect of their religion was manifested in large mounds of mollusk shells which had been collected from the Red River Delta. Bodies had been buried under these piles of shells in a seated position with bent knees - in the same position as many buried bodies found throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. This signifies to archaeologists that these early people had an advanced society based on fishing and that their religion was oriented toward the sea. At a location further south of the Tonkin Delta, in the central region of Vietnam's coast, remains of another culture have been found at Sa Hu·ª≥nh. The Sa Hu·ª≥nh culture existed from about 4000 to 1000 BCE. Tools, ornamental beads, and funerary jars have also been found at these archaeological sites. These jars were usually located at the water's edge and probably signified a dead person's journey out to sea. Throughout Southeast Asia, the Neolithic Period can be considered the period in which organized societies developed. During this period the Vietnamese people spread across a large area from the foothills of the Annamite Range to the eastern coast of Northern Vietnam. It is thought that they lived in small communities with groups of extended families living in a simple communal way. The growing of rice, their staple food, had developed into two distinct methods, shifting cultivation, done on a dry field, usually in upland areas, and wet rice cultivation, which involved the construction of dikes around rivers that collected water into knee-deep ponds in which the rice was grown. =Cultural and historical influences= North Before the Chinese actually annexed Vietnam, groups from present-day southern China began to move into the Tonkin Delta in order to start new lives after being forced to leave their homelands. Thus, around the 3rd century BC, changes in China began to heavily influence the ƒê√¥ng S∆°n culture which was thriving in Vietnam. One important series of changes occurred along the Yangtze River in southern China. According to historians, in 333 BC, three cultures, the Shu, the Ch'u, and the Yueh began to fight among themselves, causing the Yueh to move south in small scattered kingdoms. At the same time, the central power of northern China, the Ch'in Dynasty, began to split so that a large number of princes and members of the aristocracy also moved south to start their own small kingdoms. Sino- Vietnamese Ë∂ä gave the name \\"Viet\\". People of Tonkin, 1861-1880 The people of the Red River civilizations, also known as Lac society, began to feel the effects of these newcomers who gradually moved into their homelands. Many historians believe that it was not difficult for the Yueh to be incorporated into Lac society. However, the Au Lac lords began to fight with the Ch'in princes. While they were involved in this fighting, another group from the northwest, the Thuc (who had once been the Shu of the Yangtze River) took advantage of weakness in the area and asserted their authority. The legendary C·ªï Loa Citadel, the remains of which can still be seen today. An D∆∞∆°ng V∆∞∆°ng's arrival explains the origins of the legendary √Çu L·∫°c kingdom which is usually associated with the height of ƒê√¥ng S∆°n culture. Vietnamese language may be representative of these influences. South Vietnam today is characterized by two major river deltas, the Red River Delta in the north and the Mekong Delta in the south. In prehistoric times, before the ethnic Vietnamese moved southward, another Indianized kingdom formed along the coasts north of the Mekong Delta. It was composed of Malayo-Polynesian people and was highly influenced by Indian and Indonesian traders and religious people. This area developed into the kingdom of Champa which was similar to other Hindu- Buddhist civilizations which were being formed in Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, and Cambodia. Map of Vietnam showing the conquest of the south (the Nam ti·∫øn, 1069‚Äì1757) Champa did not become an established kingdom until 192 AD after which time it became quite advanced with walled cities, books and archives, palaces, and monuments, many of which were built by slaves. Residents of Champa were able to grow two crops of rice per year with a sophisticated system of irrigation which was overseen by a water chief, someone selected to monitor the irrigation ditches and canals. While some cities in Champa remained centers of religion and trade, this kingdom was mostly made up of small territories in river valleys and on coastal plains, each with a local ruler who was seen by his subjects as a representative of the gods. The height of Cham civilization occurred during the 6th to 8th centuries. At this time, much trading occurred between the Chams and the highlanders who needed salt as well as with coastal villages in Vietnam and with China. Important trade items included elephant and rhinoceros tusks, cardamom, bee wax, aromatic woods and betel nut. However, when times were not going well in the small coastal city- states, the people turned to looting and pirating in other coastal towns of Champa and Vietnam. After centuries of these pirate raids, the Vietnamese began to fight back and eventually conquered Champa, but not before many aspects of Cham society were incorporated into the societies of Vietnam Cham society is organized in a cluster of City-States, not very different from ancient Greece, in contrast of centralized Vietnamese society influenced by China in the north. =Prehistoric mythology= The movement and changing cultures of early Vietnam are explained through myths which give historians insight into what might have happened in the Dong Son era. The most well-known origin myth says the first Vietnamese people originated from the marriage of a dragon father and a fairy mother who had 100 sons. Because the dragon was a water creature and the fairy was a land creature, they decided they could no longer stay together. The fairy mother took 50 sons to the highlands, and the dragon father took 50 sons to the coast. One of the sons who went with the dragon father became the founder of the Hung Dynasty which is thought to have existed from as early as 2769 BC until 100 AD. The 50 sons who went to the coast are considered to be the people of the Lac Kingdom. According to historians and archaeologists, the Lac people were coastal people who had developed a sophisticated wet rice agricultural society from as early as 1500 BC. The Hungs, as depicted in the mythology, were mountain people who are believed to have had a reciprocal agreement with the Lac Kingdom so that the Hungs protected the Lacs from aggressive mountain groups in return for rice and other crops grown on the coastal plains of the Red River. These mythological stories, which in many cases can be matched with archaeological remains, tell of the joining of fire and water, or the earth people and the water people. The joining of these two elements has both historical and religious meaning.Paul Mus, \\"Vi√™t Nam. Sociologie d'une guerre\\", Seuil, Paris, 1952. Many historians believe that the original people of Vietnam came both overland and across the water bringing different cultures, languages, and types of people together in the Tonkin Delta. Some historians believe that the water god of the Dong Son people was the frog, which might explain the many frogs found on the Dong Son drums and might indicate that the first Dong Son people arrived in Vietnam by sea. Later this symbol was changed to the dragon following Chinese mythology. These origin myths were not written down by the Vietnamese people until about the 13th century AD, long after the Vietnamese had been colonized by the Chinese.Thanh H. Vuong, \\"Th√©orie des contextes et relations internationales: d√©part de la premi√®re Guerre d'Indochine\\", dans √âtudes Internationales, Vol. XVII, No. 3, pp, 571-597, septembre 1986 Rickshaw in Hanoi in the 19th century Origin myths also show how the early Vietnamese people saw themselves in terms of their environment. Since water and sun were the most important elements of nature, they were incorporated into their mythology in a way which gave the people and the elements a common origin. Much of early Vietnamese religion involved nature and human relationships with their surroundings. The early Vietnamese people compared the soil, the water, and the sun to God in animism. In these elements there was energy which benefited the people and the greater power to help or to destroy. At times this power was compared to that of a child who may cause great destruction without even realizing it. In the earliest times people believed in ghosts and spirits which were thought to dwell in every tree, stone, mountain, cloud, stream, and animal. Rocks and mountains were thought to be able to multiply. These spirits were said to be the wandering souls of the dead, the ancestors of the people who had settled nearby. This type of religion is known as an ancestor cult. Because the ancestor spirits were the medium between living people and the greater forces of nature, they had to be honored in rituals and sacrifices in order to maintain harmony between the elements, the spirits, the ancestors, and the people. Later, as the Vietnamese people were converted to Buddhism, Taoism, and then Confucianism by the Chinese, most villagers maintained these original beliefs‚Äîespecially those involving ancestor cult and incorporated them into the new religions. This is an example of \\"creative borrowing\\" by a people while their own culture remains a strong underlying force.Thanh H. Vuong, \\"colonisations du Vi√™t Nam et colonialisme vietnamien\\", dans √âtudes Internationales, Vol. XVIII, No. 3 pp. 546-571, septembre 1987 Early historical period Chinese histories refer to the early inhabitants of southern China and northern Vietnam as the Baiyue, also shortened to Yu√®,Hashimoto, Oi-kan Yue, Phonology of Cantonese, Cambridge University Press, 1972, p. 1. which is cognate to Vietnamese Vi·ªát. In 258 BCE An D∆∞∆°ng V∆∞∆°ng founded the kingdom of √Çu L·∫°c in the area of present-day northern Vietnam. In 208 BC, Zhao Tuo, a former Qin dynasty general from China, allied with the leaders of the Yue in the area of modern-day Guangdong and declared himself king of the Nanyue \\"Southern Yue\\". He defeated An D∆∞∆°ng V∆∞∆°ng and combined √Çu L·∫°c with his territories in southern China. Diaspora New Year parade, San Jose, California Originally from northern Vietnam and southern China, the Vietnamese have conquered much of the land belonging to the former Champa Kingdom and Khmer Empire over the centuries. They are the dominant ethnic group in most provinces of Vietnam, and constitute a significant portion of the population of Cambodia. Beginning around the sixteenth century, groups of Vietnamese migrated to Cambodia and China for commerce and political purposes. Descendants of Vietnamese migrants in China form the Gin ethnic group in the country and primarily reside in and around Guangxi Province. Vietnamese form the largest ethnic minority group in Cambodia, at 5% of the population.CIA - The World Factbook, Cambodia, retrieved 11 December 2012 Under the Khmer Rouge, they were heavily persecuted and survivors of the regime largely fled to Vietnam. During French colonialism, Vietnam was regarded as the most important colony in Asia by the French colonial powers, and the Vietnamese had a higher social standing than other ethnic groups in French Indochina.Carine Hahn, Le Laos, Karthala, 1999, page 77 As a result, educated Vietnamese were often trained to be placed in colonial government positions in the other Asian French colonies of Laos and Cambodia rather than locals of the respective colonies. There was also a significant representation of Vietnamese students in France during this period, primarily consisting of members of the elite class. A large number of Vietnamese also migrated to France as workers, especially during World War I and World War II, when France recruited soldiers and locals of its colonies to help with war efforts in Metropolitan France. The wave of migrants to France during World War I formed the first major presence of Vietnamese people in France and the Western world.La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier (in French) Congregation Of The Mother Coredemptrix in Carthage, MissouriWhen Vietnam gained its independence from France in 1954, a number of Vietnamese loyal to the colonial government also migrated to France. During the partition of Vietnam into North and South, a number of South Vietnamese students also arrived to study in France, along with individuals involved in commerce for trade with France, which was a principal economic partner with South Vietnam. Forced repatriation in 1970 and deaths during the Khmer Rouge era reduced the Vietnamese population in Cambodia from between 250,000 and 300,000 in 1969 to a reported 56,000 in 1984.\\"Cambodia ‚Äì Population\\". Library of Congress Country Studies. The Fall of Saigon and end of the Vietnam War prompted the start of the Vietnamese diaspora, which saw millions of Vietnamese fleeing the country from the new communist regime. Recognizing an international humanitarian crisis, many countries accepted Vietnamese refugees, primarily the United States, France, Australia and Canada. Meanwhile, under the new communist regime, tens of thousands of Vietnamese were sent to work or study in Eastern Bloc counties of Central and Eastern Europe as development aid to the Vietnamese government and for migrants to acquire skills that were to be brought home to help with development. However, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a vast majority of these overseas Vietnamese decided to remain in their host nations.

Drivers pass by Engineer Mountain and Twilight Peak before crossing Coal Bank Pass. Next is Molas Pass, which offers a panoramic view of Molas Lake, the Animas River Gorge, and Snowdon Peak. Northbound travelers then pass through the town of Silverton, elevation 9,320 feet (2841 m), surrounded by 13,000 foot (4000 m) peaks Sultan Mountain, Kendall Mountain, and Storm Peak. The highway leaves Silverton and proceeds up Mineral Creek Valley before ascending to Red Mountain Pass. The ruins of the Longfellow Mine are visible along the way. The highway then goes through a series of steep grades and hairpin turns before reaching Lookout Point, which offers a view of the town of Ouray. Looking south toward Red Mountain Pass. This section of the route passes over three mountain passes: * Coal Bank Pass, elevation . * Molas Pass, elevation . * Red Mountain Pass, elevation . \\"overpass\\" for an active avalanche chute on the Million Dollar Highway, south of Ouray. The origin of the name Million Dollar Highway is disputed. There are several legends, though, including that it cost a million dollars a mile to build in the 1920s, and that its fill dirt contains a million dollars in gold ore. There are seventy named avalanche paths that intersect Highway 550 in the between Ouray and Silverton, Colorado. U.S. 550 ends at the corner of Townsend Avenue and San Juan Avenue in Montrose, Colorado at the junction of its parent route U.S. Highway 50.  History  A view of the Million Dollar Highway pass. The original portion of the Million Dollar Highway was a toll road built by Otto Mears in 1883 to connect Ouray and Ironton. Another toll road was built over Red Mountain Pass from Ironton to Silverton. In the late 1880s Otto Mears turned to building railroads and built the Silverton Railroad north from Silverton over Red Mountain Pass to reach the lucrative mining districts around Red Mountain, terminating at Albany just eight miles (13 km) south of Ouray. The remaining eight miles (13 km) were considered too difficult and steep for a railroad. At one point a cog railroad was proposed, but it never made it beyond the planning stage. In the early 1920s, the original toll road was rebuilt at considerable cost and became the present day US 550\\\\. The Million Dollar Highway was completed in 1924. Today the entire route is part of the San Juan Skyway Scenic Byway. US 550 was part of the original 1926 federal highway system. The original highway extended 110 miles (177 km) from Montrose, Colorado at U.S. Highway 50 to U.S. Highway 450 (now U.S. Highway 160) at Durango, Colorado. In 1934, Highway 550 was extended through Farmington to Shiprock, New Mexico. In 1989, the western end of US 550 was replaced with US 64 between Farmington and Shiprock. In 2000, US 550 was extended further south from Aztec to Bernalillo to replace the newly upgraded NM 44 and NM 544, at which time all of US 550 in New Mexico was four lanes. In 2009 US 50 was re- routed onto the San Juan Avenue bypass to avoid downtown Montrose. As a result, U.S. 550 was extended approximately one mile northwest to intersect with the new U.S. 50 alignment.

It is also a critical route that connects the cities of Winston-Salem, Summerfield, and Reidsville with one another. Route description Elizabeth City US 158 is a parallel of U.S. Route 58 (which runs generally through southern Virginia). The route does not intersect its parent, instead intersecting its sibling, US 258\\\\. It currently runs for from Mocksville, at US 64/US 601 to Whalebone Junction in the town of Nags Head, North Carolina. A stretch skirts the Great Dismal Swamp. In Mocksville, it begins and heads north of the US 64/US 601 junction, through the downtown area. Out of town, it turns northeasterly, following in parallel to Interstate 40 (I-40) to Winston-Salem, where it merges with the US 421 freeway for a short concurrency through the downtown area. Just east of town, it leaves US 421 and turns roughly north, closely paralleling nearby US 311, heading into Walkertown where both routes intersect NC 66. Here, Motorists can use NC 66 to connect between US 158 and US 311 within town. It then passes through Belews Creek, taking on a northeasterly path and effectively bypassing the Kernersville area, and passes thru Stokesdale where it meets two more NC Highways, NC 65, and NC 68. Shortly after, it passes thru the north part of Summerfield, intersecting Interstate 73 (which carries U.S. Route 220 along it). It then leads further east to Reidsville, where it links to US 29 Business. From Reidsville, US 158 connects the northern counties of North Carolina, going through the cities and towns of Yanceyville, Roxboro, Oxford, Henderson, Roanoke Rapids, Murfreesboro, and Elizabeth City. From North Carolina Highway 168 (NC 168) eastward, it carries traffic from the Norfolk region to the Outer Banks. Normally, the route is a four-lane undivided highway with a speed limit of in Dare County, from its eastern terminus to the Wright Memorial Bridge. Most of the route is otherwise a four-lane divided highway with a speed limit until NC 168 (which carries traffic to Chesapeake, Virginia), where it turns left at an at-grade intersection. It then returns to being undivided. In Dare County, the highway runs in a north-south direction, although it is signed west-east. It acts as a bypass route for the Virginia Dare Trail (NC 12), which runs parallel to US 158 to the east. For the entire length of the Outer Banks, US 158 is known as Croatan Highway. History US 158 was established in 1932, as a concurrency with NC 48 from Mocksville to Murfreesboro and NC 12, from Murfreesboro to Virginia state line. US 158 also replaced US 117 routing between Murfreesboro to Franklin, Virginia. In 1934, NC 48 and NC 12 were removed from its routing. In 1937 or 1938, US 158's western terminus moved from Depot Street to Main Street in Mocksville. In 1941, US 158 swapped routes with NC 65 between Stokesdale and Reidsville. Also in the same year, US 158 was rerouted east at Murfreesboro, replacing NC 30 to Camden and NC 34 crossing the Croatan Sound and ending at NC 345, near Manteo; its old alignment north of Murfreesboro became part of US 258\\\\. Between 1945-1949, US 158's western terminus moved to its current location at Main and Lexington Streets, in Mocksville; also in same time period, US 158 was moved onto new routing through Roxboro; its old alignment along Main Street became US 501A. In 1946, US 158 bypassed north of Gatesville, with its old alignment became US 158A. Around 1951, US 158 was removed from Roanoke Island and was truncated at its current eastern terminus at Whalebone Junction, on Bodie Island; its former routing was replaced by US 64/US 264\\\\. In 1951, US 158 was placed on new bypass north of Henderson, leaving behind US 158A along its old alignment. Around 1954, US 158 was placed on one-way streets in downtown Winston-Salem: westbound via Clover Dale Street, Glade Street and fifth street; eastbound via first and fourth streets. In 1955, US 158 was bypassed north of Warrenton, leaving behind US 158A along its former alignment. In 1959, US 158 was moved onto new expressway between Stratford to Marshall and Cherry Streets, in Winston-Salem. In 1960, US 158 was moved onto its current routing in Bodie Island, leaving behind US 158 Business. By 1962, US 158 had completed its transition onto the freeway in Winston-Salem, leaving behind US 158 Business. Between 1963-1967, US 158 was routed onto one-way streets in Weldon. In 1968, US 158 was rerouted in Elizabeth City. In 1971, US 158 was placed onto the Yanceyville bypass; its old routing through the downtown area was partly replaced by NC 62, with Main Street downgraded to secondary road. In 1973, US 13/US 158 was placed on new western bypass of Winton, its old alignment became part of NC 45. In 1979, US 158 was placed on bypass north of Reidsville, via US 29 Bus. and NC 14; its old alignment became mostly secondary roads, with just part remaining as NC 87. In 1984, US 17/US 158 was rerouted again in Elizabeth City. In 1995, US 158 was rerouted onto new bypass south of Murfreesboro, leaving behind US 158 Business. In May 2016, NCDOT's applied to AASHTO to change US 158's route in the Reidsville area. Instead of following Bus. US 29 and NC 87 north to NC 14 and then South-east on NC 14 to US 29, the route would bypass the City by taking US 158 south along Bus. US 29/NC 87 to where they split and then following NC 87 South to US 29. US 158 would then run concurrent with US 29 to the NC 14 exit where it would resume its old alignment. AASHTO approved the change on May 24 at the meeting of the Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering in Waterloo, Iowa. NCDOT passed its ordinance approving the change on March 5, 2018. =U.S. Route 117= U.S. Route 117 (US 117) was established in 1926 to run for from Norlina, through the towns of Warrenton, Roanoke Rapids, and Murfreesboro; from there it went north into Virginia through Franklin, Suffolk, Portsmouth, and Norfolk to Virginia Beach. It was cut back to Franklin in 1931 or 1932, being replaced by US 58 east of there, and soon afterwards the remainder was renumbered US 158.Virginia Highways Page: US 117 Junction list Special routes =Winston-Salem business loop= U.S. Route 158 Business, was established in 1962 as a renumbering of mainline US 158 in downtown Winston-Salem.

The name refers to a general family of knots, not an individual knot. While this knot is typically made around a cylinder, the knot can also be formed into a flat, mat-like shape. Some variants can be arranged into a roughly spherical shape, akin to a monkey's fist knot. This knot is primarily used for tightening up underlying material, to overlay as a tubular covering knot, to prevent slipping, and to add a decorative element. A notable practical use for the Turk's head is to mark the \\"king spoke\\" of a ship's wheel (the spoke that is upright when the rudder is in a central position). The knot takes its name from a notional resemblance to a turban (), though a turban is wound rather than interwoven.  Leads and bights  A 3-lead, 10-bight Turk's head knot, doubled Every type of Turk's head knot is classified according to the number of leads and bights, as well as the method of construction. The number of bights is the number of crossings it makes as it goes around the circumference of the cylinder. The number of leads is the number of strands around the circumference of the cylinder, before doubling, tripling, etc. Depending on the number of leads and bights, a Turk's head may be tied using a single strand or multiple strands. Mathematically, the number of strands is the greatest common divisor of the number of leads and the number of bights. The knot may be tied with a single strand if and only if the two numbers are coprime. For example, 3 lead √ó 5 bight (3√ó5), or 5 lead √ó 7 bight (5√ó7). Turk's head knots on netting There are three groupings of Turk's head knots: # Narrow, where the number of leads is two or more less than the number of bights (3√ó5, or 3√ó7). # Long or wide where the number of leads is two or more greater than the number of bights (5√ó3, or 16√ó7). # Square, where there is a difference of one between leads and bights (7√ó8 or 8√ó7). The number of bights determines the shape found at the center. Three bights create a triangular shape, while four create a square. A two lead, 3 bight Turk's head is a double overhand knot.Shaw, George Russell (). Knots: Useful & Ornamental, p.61. . A two lead, three bight Turk's head is also a trefoil knot if the ends are joined together. (2,n) alternating torus knots are (2,n) Turk's head knots.Bozhuyuk, M. E. (1993). Topics in Knot Theory, p.3. . ((p,q) = q times around a circle in the interior of the torus, and p times around its axis of rotational symmetry.) Turk's head knots are easy to edit though hard to tie. You might find yourself in a fix trying to tie one.  Uses in culture  The World Organization of the Scout Movement uses a variation of the Turk's head knot called a woggle to affix their neckerchiefs and as a fire starting tool. The woggle is also used by some Scout Leaders who complete training courses to be awarded the Wood Badge insignia. It is an official part of the uniform.

It was originally identified in 1932 in plant alkaloid extracts and has been isolated from Dicentra cucullaria, Adlumia fungosa, and several Corydalis species (all in subfamily Fumarioideae, previously known as family Fumariaceae). Since it blocks the inhibitory action of GABA receptors, the action of bicuculline mimics epilepsy; it also causes convulsions. This property is utilized in laboratories across the world in the in vitro study of epilepsy, generally in hippocampal or cortical neurons in prepared brain slices from rodents. This compound is also routinely used to isolate glutamatergic (excitatory amino acid) receptor function. The action of bicuculline is primarily on the ionotropic GABAA receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels concerned chiefly with the passing of chloride ions across the cell membrane, thus promoting an inhibitory influence on the target neuron. These receptors are the major targets for benzodiazepines and related anxiolytic drugs. The half- maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of bicuculline on GABAA receptors is 3 ŒºM. In addition to being a potent GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline can be used to block Ca2+-activated potassium channels.

These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders. Found in many household and industrial products, endocrine disruptors \\"interfere with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the body that are responsible for development, behavior, fertility, and maintenance of homeostasis (normal cell metabolism).\\" Any system in the body controlled by hormones can be derailed by hormone disruptors. Specifically, endocrine disruptors may be associated with the development of learning disabilities, severe attention deficit disorder, cognitive and brain development problems; deformations of the body (including limbs); breast cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid and other cancers; sexual development problems such as feminizing of males or masculinizing effects on females, etc. There has been controversy over endocrine disruptors, with some groups calling for swift action by regulators to remove them from the market, and regulators and other scientists calling for further study. Some endocrine disruptors have been identified and removed from the market (for example, a drug called diethylstilbestrol), but it is uncertain whether some endocrine disruptors on the market actually harm humans and wildlife at the doses to which wildlife and humans are exposed. Additionally, a key scientific paper, published in 1996 in the journal Science, which helped launch the movement of those opposed to endocrine disruptors, was retracted and its author found to have committed scientific misconduct. Studies in cells and laboratory animals have shown that EDCs can cause adverse biological effects in animals, and low-level exposures may also cause similar effects in human beings. EDCs in the environment may also be related to reproductive and infertility problems in wildlife and bans and restrictions on their use has been associated with a reduction in health problems and the recovery of some wildlife populations. History The term endocrine disruptor was coined at the Wingspread Conference Center in Wisconsin, in 1991. One of the early papers on the phenomenon was by Theo Colborn in 1993. In this paper, she stated that environmental chemicals disrupt the development of the endocrine system, and that effects of exposure during development are often permanent. Although the endocrine disruption has been disputed by some, work sessions from 1992 to 1999 have generated consensus statements from scientists regarding the hazard from endocrine disruptors, particularly in wildlife and also in humans. The Endocrine Society released a scientific statement outlining mechanisms and effects of endocrine disruptors on ‚Äúmale and female reproduction, breast development and cancer, prostate cancer, neuroendocrinology, thyroid, metabolism and obesity, and cardiovascular endocrinology,‚Äù and showing how experimental and epidemiological studies converge with human clinical observations ‚Äúto implicate EDCs as a significant concern to public health.‚Äù The statement noted that it is difficult to show that endocrine disruptors cause human diseases, and it recommended that the precautionary principle should be followed. A concurrent statement expresses policy concerns. Endocrine disrupting compounds encompass a variety of chemical classes, including drugs, pesticides, compounds used in the plastics industry and in consumer products, industrial by-products and pollutants, and even some naturally produced botanical chemicals. Some are pervasive and widely dispersed in the environment and may bioaccumulate. Some are persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and can be transported long distances across national boundaries and have been found in virtually all regions of the world, and may even concentrate near the North Pole, due to weather patterns and cold conditions. Others are rapidly degraded in the environment or human body or may be present for only short periods of time. Health effects attributed to endocrine disrupting compounds include a range of reproductive problems (reduced fertility, male and female reproductive tract abnormalities, and skewed male/female sex ratios, loss of fetus, menstrual problems); changes in hormone levels; early puberty; brain and behavior problems; impaired immune functions; and various cancers. One example of the consequences of the exposure of developing animals, including humans, to hormonally active agents is the case of the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES), a nonsteroidal estrogen and not an environmental pollutant. Prior to its ban in the early 1970s, doctors prescribed DES to as many as five million pregnant women to block spontaneous abortion, an off-label use of this medication prior to 1947. It was discovered after the children went through puberty that DES affected the development of the reproductive system and caused vaginal cancer. The relevance of the DES saga to the risks of exposure to endocrine disruptors is questionable, as the doses involved are much higher in these individuals than in those due to environmental exposures. Aquatic life subjected to endocrine disruptors in an urban effluent have experienced decreased levels of serotonin and increased feminization. In 2013 the WHO and the United Nations Environment Programme released a study, the most comprehensive report on EDCs to date, calling for more research to fully understand the associations between EDCs and the risks to health of human and animal life. The team pointed to wide gaps in knowledge and called for more research to obtain a fuller picture of the health and environmental impacts of endocrine disruptors. To improve global knowledge the team has recommended: * Testing: known EDCs are only the 'tip of the iceberg' and more comprehensive testing methods are required to identify other possible endocrine disruptors, their sources, and routes of exposure. * Research: more scientific evidence is needed to identify the effects of mixtures of EDCs on humans and wildlife (mainly from industrial by-products) to which humans and wildlife are increasingly exposed. * Reporting: many sources of EDCs are not known because of insufficient reporting and information on chemicals in products, materials and goods. * Collaboration: more data sharing between scientists and between countries can fill gaps in data, primarily in developing countries and emerging economies.  Endocrine system  Endocrine systems are found in most varieties of animals. The endocrine system consists of glands that secrete hormones, and receptors that detect and react to the hormones. Hormones travel throughout the body and act as chemical messengers. Hormones interface with cells that contain matching receptors in or on their surfaces. The hormone binds with the receptor, much like a key would fit into a lock. The endocrine system regulates adjustments through slower internal processes, using hormones as messengers. The endocrine system secretes hormones in response to environmental stimuli and to orchestrate developmental and reproductive changes. The adjustments brought on by the endocrine system are biochemical, changing the cell's internal and external chemistry to bring about a long term change in the body. These systems work together to maintain the proper functioning of the body through its entire life cycle. Sex steroids such as estrogens and androgens, as well as thyroid hormones, are subject to feedback regulation, which tends to limit the sensitivity of these glands. Hormones work at very small doses (part per billion ranges). Endocrine disruption can thereby also occur from low-dose exposure to exogenous hormones or hormonally active chemicals such as bisphenol A. These chemical can bind to receptors for other hormonally mediated processes. Furthermore, since endogenous hormones are already present in the body in biologically active concentrations, additional exposure to relatively small amounts of exogenous hormonally active substances can disrupt the proper functioning of the body's endocrine system. Thus, an endocrine disruptor can elicit adverse effects at much lower doses than a toxicity, acting through a different mechanism. The timing of exposure is also critical. Most critical stages of development occur in utero, where the fertilized egg divides, rapidly developing every structure of a fully formed baby, including much of the wiring in the brain. Interfering with the hormonal communication in utero can have profound effects both structurally and toward brain development. Depending on the stage of reproductive development, interference with hormonal signaling can result in irreversible effects not seen in adults exposed to the same dose for the same length of time. Experiments with animals have identified critical developmental time points in utero and days after birth when exposure to chemicals that interfere with or mimic hormones have adverse effects that persist into adulthood. Disruption of thyroid function early in development may be the cause of abnormal sexual development in both males and females early motor development impairment, and learning disabilities. There are studies of cell cultures, laboratory animals, wildlife, and accidentally exposed humans that show that environmental chemicals cause a wide range of reproductive, developmental, growth, and behavior effects, and so while \\"endocrine disruption in humans by pollutant chemicals remains largely undemonstrated, the underlying science is sound and the potential for such effects is real.\\" While compounds that produce estrogenic, androgenic, antiandrogenic, and antithyroid actions have been studied, less is known about interactions with other hormones. The interrelationships between exposures to chemicals and health effects are rather complex. It is hard to definitively link a particular chemical with a specific health effect, and exposed adults may not show any ill effects. But, fetuses and embryos, whose growth and development are highly controlled by the endocrine system, are more vulnerable to exposure and may suffer overt or subtle lifelong health and/or reproductive abnormalities. Prebirth exposure, in some cases, can lead to permanent alterations and adult diseases. Some in the scientific community are concerned that exposure to endocrine disruptors in the womb or early in life may be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including reduced IQ, ADHD, and autism. Certain cancers and uterine abnormalities in women are associated with exposure to Diethylstilbestrol (DES) in the womb due to DES used as a medical treatment. In another case, phthalates in pregnant women‚Äôs urine was linked to subtle, but specific, genital changes in their male infants ‚Äì a shorter, more female-like anogenital distance and associated incomplete descent of testes and a smaller scrotum and penis. The science behind this study has been questioned by phthalate industry consultants. As of June 2008, there are only five studies of anogenital distance in humans, and one researcher has stated \\"Whether AGD measures in humans relate to clinically important outcomes, however, remains to be determined, as does its utility as a measure of androgen action in epidemiologic studies.\\" Effects on levels of the body's own hormones While the fact that there are chemical differences between endocrine disruptors and endogenous hormones have sometimes been cited as an argument for endocrine disruptors affecting only some (not all) of the traits that are affected by hormones, toxicology research shows that many of the effects of endocrine disruptors target the aspects of hormone effects that make one hormone regulate the production and/or degradation of the body's own hormones. These regulation effects are intertwined so that a hormone that is level affected by another hormone in turn affects the levels of multiple other hormones produced by the body itself, leaving no endogenous hormones or traits affected by them unaffected by endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors have the potential to mimic or antagonize natural hormones, these chemicals can exert their effects by acting through interaction with nuclear receptors, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor or membrane bound receptors. U-shaped dose-response curve Most toxicants, including endocrine disruptors, have been claimed to follow a U-shaped dose response curve. This means that very low and very high levels have more effects than mid-level exposure to a toxicant.Thomas Steeger & Joseph Tietge. White Paper on Potential Developmental Effects of Atrazine on Amphibians, 54, July 17, 2005 Endocrine disrupting effects have been noted in animals exposed to environmentally relevant levels of some chemicals. For example, a common flame retardant, BDE-47, affects the reproductive system and thyroid gland of female rats in doses of the order of those to which humans are exposed. Low concentrations of endocrine disruptors can also have synergistic effects in amphibians, but it is not clear that this is an effect mediated through the endocrine system. Critics have argued that data suggest that the amounts of chemicals in the environment are too low to cause an effect. A consensus statement by the Learning and Developmental Disabilities Initiative argued that \\"The very low-dose effects of endocrine disruptors cannot be predicted from high-dose studies, which contradicts the standard 'dose makes the poison' rule of toxicology. Nontraditional dose-response curves are referred to as nonmonotonic dose response curves.\\" The dosage objection could also be overcome if low concentrations of different endocrine disruptors are synergistic. This paper was published in Science in June 1996, and was one reason for the passage of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. The results could not be confirmed with the same and alternative methodologies, and the original paper was retracted, with Arnold found to have committed scientific misconduct by the United States Office of Research Integrity. It has been claimed that Tamoxifen and some phthalates have fundamentally different (and harmful) effects on the body at low doses than at high doses.Low Dose Makes the Poison. Living on Earth, 4 Sep 2009. Routes of exposure Food is a major mechanism by which people are exposed to pollutants. Diet is thought to account for up to 90% of a person's PCB and DDT body burden. In a study of 32 different common food products from three grocery stores in Dallas, fish and other animal products were found to be contaminated with PBDE. Since these compounds are fat soluble, it is likely they are accumulating from the environment in the fatty tissue of animals we eat. Some suspect fish consumption is a major source of many environmental contaminants. Indeed, both wild and farmed salmon from all over the world have been shown to contain a variety of man-made organic compounds. With the increase in household products containing pollutants and the decrease in the quality of building ventilation, indoor air has become a significant source of pollutant exposure. Residents living in homes with wood floors treated in the 1960s with PCB-based wood finish have a much higher body burden than the general population. A study of indoor house dust and dryer lint of 16 homes found high levels of all 22 different PBDE congeners tested for in all samples. Recent studies suggest that contaminated house dust, not food, may be the major source of PBDE in our bodies. One study estimated that ingestion of house dust accounts for up to 82% of our PBDE body burden. It has been shown that contaminated house dust is a primary source of lead in young children's bodies. It may be that babies and toddlers ingest more contaminated house dust than the adults they live with, and therefore have much higher levels of pollutants in their systems. Consumer goods are another potential source of exposure to endocrine disruptors. An analysis of the composition of 42 household cleaning and personal care products versus 43 \\"chemical free\\" products has been performed. The products contained 55 different chemical compounds: 50 were found in the 42 conventional samples representing 170 product types, while 41 were detected in 43 \\"chemical free\\" samples representing 39 product types. Parabens, a class of chemicals that has been associated with reproductive-tract issues, were detected in seven of the \\"chemical free\\" products, including three sunscreens that did not list parabens on the label. Vinyl products such as shower curtains were found to contain more than 10% by weight of the compound DEHP, which when present in dust has been associated with asthma and wheezing in children. The risk of exposure to EDCs increases as products, both conventional and \\"chemical free,\\" are used in combination. \\"If a consumer used the alternative surface cleaner, tub and tile cleaner, laundry detergent, bar soap, shampoo and conditioner, facial cleanser and lotion, and toothpaste [he or she] would potentially be exposed to at least 19 compounds: 2 parabens, 3 phthalates, MEA, DEA, 5 alkylphenols, and 7 fragrances.\\" An analysis of the endocrine disrupting chemicals in Old Order Mennonite women in mid-pregnancy determined that they have much lower levels in their systems than the general population. Mennonites eat mostly fresh, unprocessed foods, farm without pesticides, and use few or no cosmetics or personal care products. One woman who had reported using hairspray and perfume had high levels of monoethyl phthalate, while the other women all had levels below detection. Three women who reported being in a car or truck within 48 hours of providing a urine sample had higher levels of diethylhexyl phthalate which is found in polyvinyl chloride, and is used in car interiors. Additives added to plastics during manufacturing may leach into the environment after the plastic item is discarded; additives in microplastics in the ocean leach into ocean water and in plastics in landfills may escape and leach into the soil and then into groundwater. Types All people are exposed to chemicals with estrogenic effects in their everyday life, because endocrine disrupting chemicals are found in low doses in thousands of products. Chemicals commonly detected in people include DDT, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's), bisphenol A (BPA), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE's), and a variety of phthalates. In fact, almost all plastic products, including those advertised as \\"BPA free\\", have been found to leach endocrine-disrupting chemicals. In a 2011, study it was found that some \\"BPA- free\\" products released more endocrine active chemicals than the BPA- containing products. Other forms of endocrine disruptors are phytoestrogens (plant hormones). = Xenoestrogens = Xenoestrogens are a type of xenohormone that imitates estrogen. Synthetic xenoestrogens include widely used industrial compounds, such as PCBs, BPA and phthalates, which have estrogenic effects on a living organism.  Alkylphenols  Alkylphenols are xenoestrogens. The European Union has implemented sales and use restrictions on certain applications in which nonylphenols are used because of their alleged \\"toxicity, persistence, and the liability to bioaccumulate\\" but the United States Environmental Protections Agency (EPA) has taken a slower approach to make sure that action is based on \\"sound science\\". The long-chain alkylphenols are used extensively as precursors to the detergents, as additives for fuels and lubricants, polymers, and as components in phenolic resins. These compounds are also used as building block chemicals that are also used in making fragrances, thermoplastic elastomers, antioxidants, oil field chemicals and fire retardant materials. Through the downstream use in making alkylphenolic resins, alkylphenols are also found in tires, adhesives, coatings, carbonless copy paper and high performance rubber products. They have been used in industry for over 40 years. Certain alkylphenols are degradation products from nonionic detergents. Nonylphenol is considered to be a low-level endocrine disruptor owing to its tendency to mimic estrogen.  Bisphenol A (BPA)  Bisphenol A chemical structure Bisphenol A is commonly found in plastic bottles, plastic food containers, dental materials, and the linings of metal food and infant formula cans. Another exposure comes from receipt paper commonly used at grocery stores and restaurants, because today the paper is commonly coated with a BPA containing clay for printing purposes. BPA is a known endocrine disruptor, and numerous studies have found that laboratory animals exposed to low levels of it have elevated rates of diabetes, mammary and prostate cancers, decreased sperm count, reproductive problems, early puberty, obesity, and neurological problems. Early developmental stages appear to be the period of greatest sensitivity to its effects, and some studies have linked prenatal exposure to later physical and neurological difficulties. Draft Screening Assessment for The Challenge Phenol, 4,4‚Ä≤-(1-methylethylidene)bis- (Bisphenol A) Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number 80-05-7. Health Canada, 2008. Regulatory bodies have determined safety levels for humans, but those safety levels are currently being questioned or are under review as a result of new scientific studies. A 2011 cross-sectional study that investigated the number of chemicals pregnant women are exposed to in the U.S. found BPA in 96% of women. In 2010 the World Health Organization expert panel recommended no new regulations limiting or banning the use of bisphenol A, stating that \\"initiation of public health measures would be premature.\\" In August 2008, the U.S. FDA issued a draft reassessment, reconfirming their initial opinion that, based on scientific evidence, it is safe. However, in October 2008, FDA's advisory Science Board concluded that the Agency's assessment was \\"flawed\\" and hadn't proven the chemical to be safe for formula-fed infants. In January 2010, the FDA issued a report indicating that, due to findings of recent studies that used novel approaches in testing for subtle effects, both the National Toxicology Program at the National Institutes of Health as well as the FDA have some level of concern regarding the possible effects of BPA on the brain and behavior of fetuses, infants and younger children. In 2012 the FDA did ban the use of BPA in baby bottles, however the Environmental Working Group called the ban \\"purely cosmetic\\". In a statement they said, ‚ÄúIf the agency truly wants to prevent people from being exposed to this toxic chemical associated with a variety of serious and chronic conditions it should ban its use in cans of infant formula, food and beverages.\\" The Natural Resources Defense Council called the move inadequate saying, the FDA needs to ban BPA from all food packaging. In a statement a FDA spokesman said the agency's action was not based on safety concerns and that \\"the agency continues to support the safety of BPA for use in products that hold food.\\" A program initiated by NIEHS, NTP, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (named CLARITY-BPA) found no effect of chronic exposure to BPA on ratsNTP \\"CLARITY-BPA Program\\", NIH National Toxicology Program, 23 February 2018. Retrieved 5 August 2019 and the FDA considers currently authorized uses of BPA to be safe for consumers.Ostroff, Stephen. \\"Statement from Stephen Ostroff M.D., Deputy Commissioner for Foods and Veterinary Medicine, on National Toxicology Program draft report on Bisphenol A\\", FDA, 23 February 2018. Retrieved 5 August 2019. =Bisphenol S (BPS) and Bisphenol F (BPF)= Bisphenol S and Bisphenol F are analogs of bisphenol A. They are commonly found in thermal receipts, plastics, and household dust. Traces of BPS have also been found in personal care products. It is more presently being used because of the ban of BPA. BPS is used in place of BPA in ‚ÄúBPA free‚Äù items. However BPS and BPF have been shown to be as much of an endocrine disruptor as BPA. = DDT = DDT Chemical structure Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was first used as a pesticide against Colorado potato beetles on crops beginning in 1936. An increase in the incidence of malaria, epidemic typhus, dysentery, and typhoid fever led to its use against the mosquitoes, lice, and houseflies that carried these diseases. Before World War II, pyrethrum, an extract of a flower from Japan, had been used to control these insects and the diseases they can spread. During World War II, Japan stopped exporting pyrethrum, forcing the search for an alternative. Fearing an epidemic outbreak of typhus, every British and American soldier was issued DDT, who used it to routinely dust beds, tents, and barracks all over the world. DDT was approved for general, non-military use after the war ended. It became used worldwide to increase monoculture crop yields that were threatened by pest infestation, and to reduce the spread of malaria which had a high mortality rate in many parts of the world. Its use for agricultural purposes has since been prohibited by national legislation of most countries, while its use as a control against malaria vectors is permitted, as specifically stated by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants As early as 1946, the harmful effects of DDT on bird, beneficial insects, fish, and marine invertebrates were seen in the environment. The most infamous example of these effects were seen in the eggshells of large predatory birds, which did not develop to be thick enough to support the adult bird sitting on them. Further studies found DDT in high concentrations in carnivores all over the world, the result of biomagnification through the food chain. Twenty years after its widespread use, DDT was found trapped in ice samples taken from Antarctic snow, suggesting wind and water are another means of environmental transport. Recent studies show the historical record of DDT deposition on remote glaciers in the Himalayas. More than sixty years ago when biologists began to study the effects of DDT on laboratory animals, it was discovered that DDT interfered with reproductive development. Recent studies suggest DDT may inhibit the proper development of female reproductive organs that adversely affects reproduction into maturity. Additional studies suggest that a marked decrease in fertility in adult males may be due to DDT exposure. Most recently, it has been suggested that exposure to DDT in utero can increase a child's risk of childhood obesity. DDT is still used as anti-malarial insecticide in Africa and parts of Southeast Asia in limited quantities. = Polychlorinated biphenyls = Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of chlorinated compounds used as industrial coolants and lubricants. PCBs are created by heating benzene, a byproduct of gasoline refining, with chlorine. They were first manufactured commercially by the Swann Chemical Company in 1927. In 1933, the health effects of direct PCB exposure was seen in those who worked with the chemicals at the manufacturing facility in Alabama. In 1935, Monsanto acquired the company, taking over US production and licensing PCB manufacturing technology internationally. General Electric was one of the largest US companies to incorporate PCBs into manufactured equipment. Between 1952 and 1977, the New York GE plant had dumped more than 500,000 pounds of PCB waste into the Hudson River. PCBs were first discovered in the environment far from its industrial use by scientists in Sweden studying DDT. The effects of acute exposure to PCBs were well known within the companies who used Monsanto's PCB formulation who saw the effects on their workers who came into contact with it regularly. Direct skin contact results in a severe acne-like condition called chloracne. Exposure increases the risk of skin cancer, liver cancer, and brain cancer. Monsanto tried for years to downplay the health problems related to PCB exposure in order to continue sales. The detrimental health effects of PCB exposure to humans became undeniable when two separate incidents of contaminated cooking oil poisoned thousands of residents in Japan (Yush≈ç disease, 1968) and Taiwan (Yu-cheng disease, 1979), leading to a worldwide ban on PCB use in 1977. Recent studies show the endocrine interference of certain PCB congeners is toxic to the liver and thyroid, increases childhood obesity in children exposed prenatally, and may increase the risk of developing diabetes. PCBs in the environment may also be related to reproductive and infertility problems in wildlife. In Alaska it is thought that they may contribute to reproductive defects, infertility and antler malformation in some deer populations. Declines in the populations of otters and sea lions may also be partially due to their exposure to PCBs, the insecticide DDT, other persistent organic pollutants. Bans and restrictions on the use of EDCs have been associated with a reduction in health problems and the recovery of some wildlife populations. = Polybrominated diphenyl ethers = Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of compounds found in flame retardants used in plastic cases of televisions and computers, electronics, carpets, lighting, bedding, clothing, car components, foam cushions and other textiles. Potential health concern: PBDE's are structurally very similar to Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and have similar neurotoxic effects. Research has correlated halogenated hydrocarbons, such as PCBs, with neurotoxicity. PBDEs are similar in chemical structure to PCBs, and it has been suggested that PBDEs act by the same mechanism as PCBs. In the 1930s and 1940s, the plastics industry developed technologies to create a variety of plastics with broad applications. Once World War II began, the US military used these new plastic materials to improve weapons, protect equipment, and to replace heavy components in aircraft and vehicles. After WWII, manufacturers saw the potential plastics could have in many industries, and plastics were incorporated into new consumer product designs. Plastics began to replace wood and metal in existing products as well, and today plastics are the most widely used manufacturing materials. By the 1960s, all homes were wired with electricity and had numerous electrical appliances. Cotton had been the dominant textile used to produce home furnishings, but now home furnishings were composed of mostly synthetic materials. More than 500 billion cigarettes were consumed each year in the 1960s, as compared to less than 3 billion per year in the beginning of the twentieth century. When combined with high density living, the potential for home fires was higher in the 1960s than it had ever been in the US. By the late 1970s, approximately 6000 people in the US died each year in home fires. In 1972, in response to this situation, the National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control was created to study the fire problem in the US. In 1973 they published their findings in America Burning, a 192-page report that made recommendations to increase fire prevention. Most of the recommendations dealt with fire prevention education and improved building engineering, such as the installation of fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. The Commission expected that with the recommendations, a 5% reduction in fire losses could be expected each year, halving the annual losses within 14 years. Historically, treatments with alum and borax were used to reduce the flammability of fabric and wood, as far back as Roman times. Since it is a non-absorbent material once created, flame retardant chemicals are added to plastic during the polymerization reaction when it is formed. Organic compounds based on halogens like bromine and chlorine are used as the flame retardant additive in plastics, and in fabric based textiles as well. The widespread use of brominated flame retardants may be due to the push from Great Lakes Chemical Corporation (GLCC) to profit from its huge investment in bromine. In 1992, the world market consumed approximately 150,000 tonnes of bromine-based flame retardants, and GLCC produced 30% of the world supply. PBDEs have the potential to disrupt thyroid hormone balance and contribute to a variety of neurological and developmental deficits, including low intelligence and learning disabilities. Many of the most common PBDE's were banned in the European Union in 2006. Studies with rodents have suggested that even brief exposure to PBDEs can cause developmental and behavior problems in juvenile rodents and exposure interferes with proper thyroid hormone regulation. = Phthalates = Phthalates are found in some soft toys, flooring, medical equipment, cosmetics and air fresheners. They are of potential health concern because they are known to disrupt the endocrine system of animals, and some research has implicated them in the rise of birth defects of the male reproductive system. Although an expert panel has concluded that there is \\"insufficient evidence\\" that they can harm the reproductive system of infants, California,Washington state and Europe have banned them from toys. One phthalate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), used in medical tubing, catheters and blood bags, may harm sexual development in male infants. In 2002, the Food and Drug Administration released a public report which cautioned against exposing male babies to DEHP. Although there are no direct human studies the FDA report states: \\"Exposure to DEHP has produced a range of adverse effects in laboratory animals, but of greatest concern are effects on the development of the male reproductive system and production of normal sperm in young animals. In view of the available animal data, precautions should be taken to limit the exposure of the developing male to DEHP\\". Similarly, phthalates may play a causal role in disrupting masculine neurological development when exposed prenatally. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) has also disrupted insulin and glucagon signaling in animal models. = Perfluorooctanoic acid = PFOA exerts hormonal effects including alteration of thyroid hormone levels. Blood serum levels of PFOA were associated with an increased time to pregnancy ‚Äî or \\"infertility\\" ‚Äî in a 2009 study. PFOA exposure is associated with decreased semen quality. PFOA appeared to act as an endocrine disruptor by a potential mechanism on breast maturation in young girls. A C8 Science Panel status report noted an association between exposure in girls and a later onset of puberty. = Other suspected endocrine disruptors = Some other examples of putative EDCs are polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins (PCDDs) and -furans (PCDFs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phenol derivatives and a number of pesticides (most prominent being organochlorine insecticides like endosulfan, kepone (chlordecone) and DDT and its derivatives, the herbicide atrazine, and the fungicide vinclozolin), the contraceptive 17-alpha ethinylestradiol, as well as naturally occurring phytoestrogens such as genistein and mycoestrogens such as zearalenone. The molting in crustaceans is an endocrine-controlled process. In the marine penaeid shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, exposure to endosulfan resulted increased susceptibility to acute toxicity and increased mortalities in the postmolt stage of the shrimp. Many sunscreens contain oxybenzone, a chemical blocker that provides broad-spectrum UV coverage, yet is subject to a lot of controversy due its potential estrogenic effect in humans. Tributyltin (TBT) are organotin compounds that for 40 years TBT was used as a biocide in anti- fouling paint, commonly known as bottom paint. TBT has been shown to impact invertebrate and vertebrate development, disrupting the endocrine system, resulting in masculinization, lower survival rates, as well as many health problems in mammals. Temporal trends of body burden Since being banned, the average human body burdens of DDT and PCB have been declining. Since their ban in 1972, the PCB body burden in 2009 is one-hundredth of what it was in the early 1980s. On the other hand, monitoring programs of European breast milk samples have shown that PBDE levels are increasing. An analysis of PBDE content in breast milk samples from Europe, Canada, and the US shows that levels are 40 times higher for North American women than for Swedish women, and that levels in North America are doubling every two to six years. It has been discussed that the long-term slow decline in average body temperature observed since the beginning of the industrial revolution may result from disrupted thyroid hormone signalling.  Animal models  Because endocrine disruptors affect complex metabolic, reproductive, and neuroendocrine systems, they cannot be modeled in in vitro cell based assay. Consequently animal models are important for access the risk of endocrine disrupting chemicals. =Mice= There are multiple lines of genetically engineered mice used for lab studies, in this case the lines can be used as population-based genetic foundations. For instance, there is a population that is named Multi-parent and can be a Collaborative Cross (CC) or Diversity Outbred (DO). These mice while both from the same 8 founder strains, have distinct differences. The 8 founder strains, combine strains that are wild-derived (with high genetic diversity) and historically significant biomedical research bred strains. Each genetically differential line is important in EDCs response and also almost all biological processes and traits. The CC population consists of 83 inbred mouse strains that over many generations in labs came from the 8 founder strains. These inbred mice have recombinant genomes that are developed to insure every strain is equally related, this eradicates population structure and can result in false positives with qualitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. While DO mice have the identical alleles to the CC mice population. There are two major differences in these mice; 1) every individual is unique allowing for hundreds of individuals to be applied in one mapping study. Making DO mice an extremely useful tool for determining genetic relationships. 2) The catch is that DO individuals cannot be reproduced. =Transgenic= These rodents mainly mice have been bred by inserting other genes from another organism to make transgenic lines (thousands of lines) of rodents. The most recent tool used to do this is CRISPR/Cas9 which allows this process to be done more efficiently. Genes may be manipulated in a particular cell populations if done under the correct conditions. For Endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) research these rodents have become an important tool to the point where they can produce humanized mouse models. Additionally scientists use gene knockout lines of mice in order to study how certain mechanisms work when impacted by EDC‚Äôs. Transgenic rodents are an important tool for studies involving the mechanisms that are impacted by EDC but take a long time to produce and are expensive. Additionally, the genes aimed at for knockout are not always successfully targeted resulting in incomplete knockout of a gene or off-target expression. =Social Models= Experiments (gene by environment) with these relatively new rodent models may, be able to discover if there are mechanisms that EDCs could impact in the social decline in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other behavioral disorders. This is because prairie and pine voles are socially monogamous making them a better model for human social behaviors and development in relation to EDCs. Additionally the prairie vole genome has been sequenced making it feasible to do the experiments mentioned above. These voles can be compared to montane and meadow voles who are socially promiscuous and solitary, when looking at how different species have various forms of development and social brain structure. Both monogamous and promiscuous mice species have been used in these types of experiments, for more information studies can expand on this topic. More complex models that have systems that are as close as possible to humans are being looked at. Looking back at more common rodent models for instance the common ASD mouse are helpful but do not fully encompass what a model of the human social behaviors needs to. But these rodents will always just be models and this is important to keep in mind. =Zebrafish= The endocrine systems between mammals and fish are similar, because of this Danio rerio are a popular lab choice. The Danio rerio, or zebrafish work well as a model organism, part of which can be attributed to the fact that researchers are able to study them starting from the embryo, as the embryo is nearly transparent. Additionally, zebrafish have DNA sex markers, this allows the biologists to individually assign sex to fish, this is particularly important when studying endocrine disruptors as the disruptors can affect how, among other things, the sex organs work, so if by chance there is sperm in the ovaries later on through the testing it can then be pinned to the chemical without the chance of it being a genetic abnormality since the sex was determined by the researcher. Besides zebrafish being readily available, and easy to study through their different life stages, they have hugely similar genes to humans - 70% of human genes have a zebrafish counterpart and even more fascinatingly 84% of disease genes in humans have a zebrafish counterpart. Most importantly perhaps is the fact that the vast majority of endocrine disruptors end up in water ways, and so it is important to know how these disruptors affect fish, which arguably have intrinsic value and just happen to be model organisms as well. The zebrafish embryos are transparent, relatively small fish (larvae are less than a few millimeters in size). This allows scientists to view the larvae (in vivo) without killing them to study how their organs develop in particular, neuro development and transport of presumed endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC). Meaning how their development is impacted by certain chemicals. As a model, they have simple modes of endocrine disruption. Along with homologous physiological, sensory, anatomical and signal-transduction mechanism similar to mammals. Another helpful tool available to scientists is their recorded genome along with multiple transgenic lines accessible for breeding. Zebrafish and mammalian genomes when compared have prominent similarities with about 80% of human genes expressed in the fish. Additionally, this fish is also fairly inexpensive to breed and house in a lab partly due to their shorter life span and being able to house more of them, compared to mammalian models. Directions of research Research on endocrine disruptors is challenged by five complexities requiring special trial designs and sophisticated study protocols: # The dissociation of space means that, although disruptors may act by a common pathway via hormone receptors, their impact may also be mediated by effects at the levels of transport proteins, deiodinases, degradation of hormones or modified setpoints of feedback loops (i.e. allostatic load). # The dissociation of time may ensue from the fact that unwanted effects may be triggered in a small time window in the embryonal or fetal period, but consequences may ensue decades later or even in the generation of grandchildren. # The dissociation of dose implies that dose-effect relationships use to be nonlinear and sometimes even U-shaped, so that low or medium doses may have stronger effects than high doses. # The dissociation of sex reflects the fact that effects may be different depending on whether embryos or fetuses are female or male.Susan Wayland and Penelope Fenner-Crisp. ‚ÄúReducing Pesticide Risks: A Half Century of Progress.‚Äù EPA Alumni Association. March 2016. the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. The Congress of the United States has improved the evaluation and regulation process of drugs and other chemicals. The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996 simultaneously provided the first legislative direction requiring the EPA to address endocrine disruption through establishment of a program for screening and testing of chemical substances. In 1998, the EPA announced the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program by establishment of a framework for priority setting, screening and testing more than 85,000 chemicals in commerce. While the Food Quality Protection Act only required the EPA to screen pesticides for potential to produce effects similar to estrogens in humans, it also gave the EPA the authority to screen other types of chemicals and endocrine effects. Based recommendations from an advisory panel, the agency expanded the screening program to include male hormones, the thyroid system, and effects on fish and other wildlife. The basic concept behind the program is that prioritization will be based on existing information about chemical uses, production volume, structure-activity and toxicity. Screening is done by use of in vitro test systems (by examining, for instance, if an agent interacts with the estrogen receptor or the androgen receptor) and via the use of in animal models, such as development of tadpoles and uterine growth in prepubertal rodents. Full scale testing will examine effects not only in mammals (rats) but also in a number of other species (frogs, fish, birds and invertebrates). Since the theory involves the effects of these substances on a functioning system, animal testing is essential for scientific validity, but has been opposed by animal rights groups. Similarly, proof that these effects occur in humans would require human testing, and such testing also has opposition. After failing to meet several deadlines to begin testing, the EPA finally announced that they were ready to begin the process of testing dozens of chemical entities that are suspected endocrine disruptors early in 2007, eleven years after the program was announced. When the final structure of the tests was announced there was objection to their design. Critics have charged that the entire process has been compromised by chemical company interference. In 2005, the EPA appointed a panel of experts to conduct an open peer-review of the program and its orientation. Their results found that \\"the long-term goals and science questions in the EDC program are appropriate\\", however this study was conducted over a year before the EPA announced the final structure of the screening program. The EPA is still finding it difficult to execute a credible and efficient endocrine testing program. As of 2016, the EPA had estrogen screening results for 1,800 chemicals. =Europe= In 2013, a number of pesticides containing endocrine disrupting chemicals were in draft EU criteria to be banned. On the 2nd May, US TTIP negotiators insisted the EU drop the criteria. They stated that a risk-based approach should be taken on regulation. Later the same day Catherine Day wrote to Karl Falkenberg asking for the criteria to be removed. The European Commission had been to set criteria by December 2013 identifying endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in thousands of products ‚Äî including disinfectants, pesticides and toiletries ‚Äî that have been linked to cancers, birth defects and development disorders in children. However, the body delayed the process, prompting Sweden to state that it would sue the commission in May 2014 ‚Äî blaming chemical industry lobbying for the disruption. ‚ÄúThis delay is due to the European chemical lobby, which put pressure again on different commissioners. Hormone disrupters are becoming a huge problem. In some places in Sweden we see double-sexed fish. We have scientific reports on how this affects fertility of young boys and girls, and other serious effects,‚Äù Swedish Environment Minister Lena Ek told the AFP, noting that Denmark had also demanded action. In November 2014, the Copenhagen-based Nordic Council of Ministers released its own independent report that estimated the impact of environmental EDCs on male reproductive health, and the resulting cost to public health systems. It concluded that EDCs likely cost health systems across the EU anywhere from 59 million to 1.18 billion Euros a year, noting that even this represented only \\"a fraction of the endocrine related diseases\\".  Environmental and human body cleanup  There is evidence that once a pollutant is no longer in use, or once its use is heavily restricted, the human body burden of that pollutant declines. Through the efforts of several large-scale monitoring programs, the most prevalent pollutants in the human population are fairly well known. The first step in reducing the body burden of these pollutants is eliminating or phasing out their production. The second step toward lowering human body burden is awareness of and potentially labeling foods that are likely to contain high amounts of pollutants. This strategy has worked in the past - pregnant and nursing women are cautioned against eating seafood that is known to accumulate high levels of mercury. Ideally, a certification process should be in place to routinely test animal products for POP concentrations. This would help the consumer identify which foods have the highest levels of pollutants. The most challenging aspect of this problem is discovering how to eliminate these compounds from the environment and where to focus remediation efforts. Even pollutants no longer in production persist in the environment, and bio-accumulate in the food chain. An understanding of how these chemicals, once in the environment, move through ecosystems, is essential to designing ways to isolate and remove them. Working backwards through the food chain may help to identify areas to prioritize for remediation efforts. This may be extremely challenging for contaminated fish and marine mammals that have a large habitat and who consume fish from many different areas throughout their lives. Many persistent organic compounds, PCB, DDT and PBDE included, accumulate in river and marine sediments. Several processes are currently being used by the EPA to clean up heavily polluted areas, as outlined in their Green Remediation program. One of the most interesting ways is the utilization of naturally occurring microbes that degrade PCB congeners to remediate contaminated areas. There are many success stories of cleanup efforts of large heavily contaminated Superfund sites. A landfill in Austin, Texas contaminated with illegally dumped VOCs was restored in a year to a wetland and educational park. A US uranium enrichment site that was contaminated with uranium and PCBs was cleaned up with high tech equipment used to find the pollutants within the soil. The soil and water at a polluted wetlands site were cleaned of VOCs, PCBs and lead, native plants were installed as biological filters, and a community program was implemented to ensure ongoing monitoring of pollutant concentrations in the area. These case studies are encouraging due to the short amount of time needed to remediate the site and the high level of success achieved. Studies suggest that bisphenol A, certain PCBs, and phthalate compounds are preferentially eliminated from the human body through sweat.  Economic effects  Human exposure may cause some health effects, such as lower IQ and adult obesity. These effects may lead to lost productivity, disability, or premature death in some people. One source estimated that, within the European Union, this economic effect might have about twice the economic impact as the effects caused by mercury and lead contamination. The socio-economic burden of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC)-associated health effects for the European Union was estimated based on currently available literature and considering the uncertainties with respect to causality with EDCs and corresponding health-related costs to be in the range of ‚Ç¨46 billion to ‚Ç¨288 billion per year.

Early life Rick Veitch is from a large Catholic family of six children. He was raised in Bellows Falls, Vermont. Career =Early career= Veitch made his publishing debut in 1972, illustrating the underground comix horror parody Two-Fisted Zombies published by Last Gasp and written by his brother Tom Veitch,. This one-shot was excerpted in Mark Estren's History of Underground Comix. It also, according to Veitch, proved to be his ticket to admission to Joe Kubert School. Veitch then studied cartooning at The Kubert School, and was in the first class to graduate from the school in 1978, along with his future long-time collaborators Stephen R. Bissette and John Totleben. Veitch's next major project was an adaptation of the film 1941 with Bissette. During the 1980s, Veitch became known as a distinctive fantasy artist and writer for Marvel Comics' Epic Comics line, for which he created three graphic novels, Abraxas and the Earthman serialized in Epic Illustrated; Heartburst published as a standalone graphic novel; and The One originally published as a six-issue comic book limited series. Heartburst was straightforward science fiction, while The One was an ambitious and bizarre fantasy-adventure involving monstrous superheroes, the Cold War, and spiritual evolution. During this period Veitch also contributed numerous self-contained comics short stories to Epic Illustrated. =Swamp Thing= Veitch's highest-profile title was DC Comics' Swamp Thing. His friends Totleben and Bissette had both illustrated the series since Alan Moore took over as writer. Veitch joined the team for issue #37 (cover dated June 1985), in which Moore's popular character John Constantine was introduced,Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 213: John Constantine, the master magician and future star of Vertigo's John Constantine: Hellblazer, was introduced in a Swamp Thing story from writer Alan Moore, with art by Rick Veitch and John Totleben.\\" and appeared regularly after issue #50. He also worked with Moore on Miracleman, illustrating the story that graphically depicted the birth of Miracleman's child published by Eclipse Comics in Miracleman #9 (July 1986). When Moore left the Swamp Thing series after issue #64, Veitch took over as writer, dividing art duties between himself and Alfredo Alcala. His Swamp Thing stories took a similar approach to Moore's, combining horror-fantasy, ecological concerns, and an encyclopedic knowledge of DC Comics fantasy characters; he gradually turned his attention from the DC Universe to history and mythology, using time travel to introduce his hero to a variety of legendary figures. This was to conclude in issue #91. Difficulties arose after Veitch's plan for issue #88, a story in which Swamp Thing met Jesus Christ, was scrapped by DC President Jenette Kahn. Although DC had approved Veitch's initial script for the Jesus story, the topic was later deemed too inflammatory and was cancelled at the last minute. The publisher and writer were unable to reach a compromise; Veitch quit, and vowed never to work for DC until the story saw print. Though the story arc has still never been printed, Veitch eventually did return to DC. =Later work= After leaving DC, Veitch turned to the alternative comics field, where the success of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had provided the impetus for a black-and- white independent comics boom. After doing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles storyline for Mirage Studios, \\"The River\\", he began creating his own titles again, published by the Mirage spin-off Tundra Publishing. During this period, he produced the graphic novels Bratpack and The Maximortal, which were to be part of a planned cycle of books called The King Hell Heroica. After Tundra went out of business, Veitch chose to emulate the successful self-published artist Dave Sim by creating his own publishing imprint, King Hell Press. King Hell has reprinted black-and-white editions of all of his original graphic novels. Veitch was reunited with Alan Moore on two titles for Image Comics, 1963 and Supreme. He then became a regular artist on Moore's America's Best Comics line published by Wildstorm, co-creating and then illustrating the graphically innovative \\"Greyshirt\\" serial, a Spirit homage, in Tomorrow Stories, and later writing a spin-off Greyshirt series. When Wildstorm was sold, both Veitch and Moore found themselves working indirectly for DC again, despite both having long-standing conflicts with the publisher. Veitch has since begun working directly for DC again, notably on its relaunch of Aquaman and on a mini-series reimagining DC-owned Charlton Comics character The Question as a self-trained urban shaman. In 2006, Vertigo published his 352-page graphic novel, Can't Get No, a psychedelic 'road' narrative about a failed businessman finding himself after the World Trade Center attacks told without word balloons but embellished in captions with stream-of-consciousness free verse poetry loosely relating to plot developments. During the 1990s, Veitch became interested in the Internet as an alternative to traditional comics distribution. In 1998, with Steve Conley, he created the \\"online convention\\" site Comicon.com, a combination message board, news portal, and web host for comics creators. He continues to run the site, and is a vocal advocate of self-publishing in both print and digital media. He wrote and penciled the satirical Army@Love for Vertigo in 2007‚Äì2009. In September 2011, he wrote and penciled The Big Lie, a comic book in which the protagonist ‚Äì a physicist widowed on September 11, 2001 ‚Äì travels back in time to attempt to save her husband. The book takes the position that the towers' destruction was a controlled demolition. =Dream art= Veitch created a series of strips titled Roarin' Rick's Rare Bit Fiends, a reference to Winsor McCay's Dream of the Rarebit Fiend, which first appeared as backup features in his self- published titles. In 1994 he began a full-sized Rare Bit Fiends series. King Hell published 21 issues of Rare Bit Fiends and has collected the first 20 in three paperback volumes, which also include essays by Veitch speculating about the nature of dreaming. The original series also reproduced dream comics submitted by readers. Veitch had a cameo in the Cerebus the Aardvark story arc \\"Guys\\" as \\"Roaring Rick\\" where Cerebus is dreaming, and Roaring Rick appears to him and gives a surreal monologue on the nature of dreams, lucid dreaming, etc. Bibliography =Aardvark-Vanaheim= * Cerebus #126, 137, 180‚Äì182 (writer/artist) (1989‚Äì1994) =Awesome Comics= * Supreme #49‚Äì51, 52a, 52b, 54, 56 (1997‚Äì1998) * Supreme: The Return #3‚Äì6 (1999‚Äì2000) =Clifford Neal= * Dr. Wirtham's Comix & Stories #2 (1976) =DC Comics= * 9-11: The World's Finest Comic Book Writers & Artists Tell Stories to Remember, Volume Two (writer) (2002) * Aquaman vol. 6 #1‚Äì12 (writer) (2003‚Äì2004) ** Aquaman: The Waterbearer collected edition * Aquaman Secret Files and Origins 2003 #1 (writer) (2003) * DC Comics Presents #85 (Superman and Swamp Thing), #97 (Superman and the Phantom Zone criminals) (penciller) (1985‚Äì1986) * DC Special Series #13 (writer/artist) (1978) * G.I.

His style of banjo playing, as well as his singing, is considered a unique combination of Appalachian folk music and African-American blues. Contemporary folk musicians and performers consider him a seminal figure, at least in part because of the appearance of two of his recordings from the 1920s, \\"Sugar Baby\\" and \\"Country Blues\\", on Harry Smith's 1951 collection Anthology of American Folk Music. Boggs was first recorded in 1927 and again in 1929, although he worked primarily as a coal miner for most of his life. He was \\"rediscovered\\" during the folk music revival of the 1960s and spent much of his later life playing at folk music festivals and recording for Folkways Records.Marcus, Greil (1998). \\"Dock Boggs.\\" The Encyclopedia of Country Music: The Ultimate Guide to the Music. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 42‚Äì43. Biography =Early life= Boggs was born in West Norton, Virginia, in 1898, the youngest of ten children. In the late 1890s, the arrival of railroads in central Appalachia brought large-scale coal mining to the region, and by the time Dock was born, the Boggs family had made the transition from subsistence farming to working for wages and living in mining towns. Dock's father, who worked as a carpenter and blacksmith, loved singing and could read sheet music. He taught his children to sing, and several of Dock's siblings learned to play the banjo.O'Connell, Barry. \\"Down a Lonesome Road: Dock Boggs' Life in Music\\". Extended version of essay in CD liner notes for Dock Boggs: His Folkways Recordings, 1963‚Äì1968, 1998. In an interview with the folk musician Mike Seeger in the 1960s, Boggs recalled how, as a young child, he would follow an African-American guitarist named \\"Go Lightning\\" up and down the railroad tracks between Norton and Dorchester, hoping the guitarist would stop at street corners to play for change. Boggs's version of the ballad \\"John Henry\\" was based in part on the version he learned from Go Lightning during this period. He also recalled sneaking over to the African-American camps in Dorchester at night, where he first observed string bands playing at dances and parties. He was enamoured of the bands' banjo players' preference for picking, having previously been exposed only to the \\"frailing\\" style of his siblings. Around the time he began working in coal mines, Boggs began playing music more often and more seriously. He learned much of his technique during this period from his brother Roscoe and an itinerant musician named Homer Crawford, both of whom shared Dock's preference for picking. Crawford taught him \\"Hustlin' Gambler,\\" which was the basis for Boggs's \\"Country Blues.\\" He also picked up several songs (such as \\"Turkey in the Straw\\") from a local African-American musician named Jim White. Boggs probably began playing at parties around 1918. =Early career, 1927‚Äì1931= In the mid-1920s, various record companies sent representatives to southern Appalachia to hold auditions in hopes of finding new talents. Around late 1926 or early 1927, Boggs tried out at one such audition, held by Brunswick Records at the Norton Hotel. Although he played on a banjo borrowed from a local music store and needed whiskey to calm his nerves, he played well enough to gain a contract to record several sides in New York later that year. He recorded only eight sides for Brunswick, however, as he deemed their payment sufficient for only that number. Boggs's records sold moderately well, and he returned to the mining areas of southwestern Virginia and eastern Kentucky, where he began to play at parties, gatherings, and mining camps. Around this time, his brother-in-law Lee Hansucker, who was a Holiness preacher and singer, began teaching him religious songs from the Holiness and Baptist traditions. Boggs also learned a large number of songs from listening to Hansucker's vast record collection. By 1928, he was making enough money to quit working in coal mines and focus exclusively on music. He bought a new banjo and formed a band known as \\"Dock Boggs and His Cumberland Mountain Entertainers\\". At one point, he was earning three to four hundred dollars a week. While Dock was experiencing a moderate amount of success, the life of a travelling musician often left him at odds with his religious neighbors, who considered such a life sinful. His wife, Sarah, whom he had married in 1918, despised secular music and was opposed to his earning a living by playing music.Larkin, Colin, ed. (2006). \\"Dock Boggs.\\" The Encyclopedia of Popular Music. Vol. 1. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 726. The constantly moving mining camps were fraught with excess and violence, and Boggs was consistently engaging in drunken brawls that often left him or an opponent badly injured. The stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression hit southern Appalachia particularly hard, and few people had the means to pay musicians to play at gatherings or buy records. In 1929, Boggs travelled to Chicago to record four sides for Lonesome Ace Records. However, with the onset of the Great Depression, he was unable to profit from these recordings. In 1930, he travelled to Atlanta, where OKeh Records had set up a live audition on radio station WSB. Because of stage fright, however, he performed poorly. He was offered several other recording auditions over the next three years, but he could not raise enough money to cover his travel expenses. He eventually pawned his banjo and gave up hopes of making a living playing music. =Rediscovery= Boggs is buried with his wife, Sarah In June 1963, at the height of the folk music revival in the United States, the folk music scholar Mike Seeger sought out and found Boggs at his home near Needmore, Virginia. Seeger was delighted to learn that Boggs had recently repurchased a banjo and had been practicing the instrument for several months before his arrival. He persuaded Boggs to play at the American Folk Festival in Asheville, North Carolina, later that year. With Seeger's help, Boggs began recording again, eventually recording three albums for Folkways Records. Throughout the 1960s, he toured the United States, playing in clubs and at folk music festivals, including a performance before an audience of 10,000 at the Newport Folk Festival.Seeger, Mike (1998). \\"Some Personal Notes.\\" CD liner notes for Dock Boggs: His Folkways Years, 1963‚Äì1968. pp. 19‚Äì32. Smithsonian Folkways. In the early 1970s, Boggs's health began to deteriorate, and he died on his 73rd birthday. In 1968, his prot√©g√© Jack Wright started the Dock Boggs Festival, which is still held annually in Boggs's hometown of Norton. Technique and repertoire While Boggs was familiar with the clawhammer style, or \\"frailing\\", he typically played in a style known as up-picking, which involves picking upwards on the first two strings and playing one of the other three strings with the thumb. He played several songs in a lower D-modal tuning. His technique, which Seeger considered \\"a style possessed by no other recorded player,\\" was adapted to fit previously unaccompanied mountain ballads. Boggs learned a number of traditional mountain songs from his siblings, namely, \\"Sugar Baby,\\" which he learned from his brother John; \\"Danville Girl,\\" which he learned from his brother Roscoe; and \\"Little Omie Wise,\\" which he learned from his sisters. Lee Hansucker, his brother-in-law, taught him various religious songs, including \\"O Death\\", \\"Little Black Train\\", \\"Prodigal Son\\", and \\"Calvary\\". Along with \\"Turkey in the Straw\\" and \\"John Henry\\", he learned songs such as \\"Banjo Clog\\" and \\"Down South Blues\\" from African-American blues musicians. The song \\"Wise County Jail\\", written by Boggs in 1928, was inspired by an incident in which he had to flee to Kentucky after attacking a lawman who tried to break up a party at which he was playing.

History  David Wolcott Kendall was a nationally known furniture designer, during Grand Rapids' heyday as \\"Furniture City\\". The David Wolcott Memorial School was established in 1928 by the will of Helen M. Kendall, his widow. The school opened in 1931, offering a two-year program in design, with 35 students. The school was located at 145 Fountain Street, at the western edge of what is now Heritage Hill. In 1947, growing from an influx of students following World War 2, the school's name was changed to Kendall School of Design. In 1961, having outgrown the Heritage Hill site, it relocated to 1110 College Avenue NE in the Highland Park neighborhood. In 1977, Kendall began offering baccalaureate degrees, and in 1981 was accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design. It moved again, to the seven-story Manufacturer's Building at 111 Division Avenue North (on the corner of Fountain Street, a short distance from the original site) in 1984. The name of the school was changed in 1987 to Kendall College of Art and Design. As part of a merger with Ferris State University, the college bought the adjacent Interstate Building in the 1990s, constructing an atrium which became the combined structures' main entrance at 17 Fountain Street NW. In 2000 the school became formally Kendall College of Art and Design of Ferris State University, and it continued renovating the new space for studio and classroom use. After the Grand Rapids Art Museum moved out of the Federal Building to the north, the university took ownership of it and reopened it as the Woodbridge N. Ferris Building in 2012 as part of the Kendall campus. In 2013, the college merged with the Urban Institute for Contemporary Art, which had recently relocated to a new facility a few blocks to the south, and continues to operate as an arts organization.

The highway continues due north, crossing Interstate 30 in northern Morris County, and crossing into Oklahoma in northwest Bowie County. =Oklahoma= Northern terminus of US 259 in the Ouachita Mountains After crossing into McCurtain County, Oklahoma, US-259 immediately meets up with State Highway 87, and continues north through Harris. Maps indicate that US-259 and SH-87 overlap to Idabel, but officially, this is not the case, and ODOT signage does not reflect a concurrency. US-259 bypasses Idabel to the south and east, concurring with U.S. Highway 70 Bypass. East of Idabel, the bypass route ends, and US-259 begins a concurrency with mainline US-70 and SH-3. The three highways continue north to Broken Bow, where US-70 splits to the east toward DeQueen, Arkansas and SH-3 splits to the west, bound for Antlers. US-259 continues north alone, taking a winding path through the Ouachita Mountains of southeastern Oklahoma. The route passes Broken Bow Lake on its west side, with State Highway 259A serving as an access loop to the lake and Beavers Bend State Resort. Near the lake, US-259 crosses through the Ouachita National Forest for the first time. Near Smithville, the highway serves as the western terminus of State Highway 4. North of the SH-4 junction, US-259 crosses into Le Flore County. The U.S. route then serves as the eastern terminus of SH-144 near Octavia. US-259 reenters the National Forest north of this junction, and intersects SH-63 at Big Cedar. It then has a junction with SH-1, the Talimena Drive. The highway reunites with US-59 about south of Heavener, reaching its northern terminus. History In Texas, the highway was designated in 1962 and assumed the entire route of a previous iteration and alignment of State Highway 26, which was then cancelled. (The SH 26 designation has since returned, on another roadway elsewhere in the state.) Prior to 1985, US 259 between Kilgore and Longview followed the current route of Texas State Highway 31. It entered Longview from the southwest at the intersection of South St. and Spur 63. It then followed Spur 63 to US 80. US 259 then ran concurrently with US 80 to Eastman Road. At the US 80/Eastman Rd. intersection, the previous alignment of US 259 turned left to go north on Eastman. In 1985, US 259 was rerouted to its current route along Interstate 20 to Eastman Rd., then left to go north, along the eastern edge of Longview, bypassing the central business district. Major intersections Special routes =Kilgore business route= US-259 has one Business route in Texas. In 2006, a new bypass was completed around the eastern side of Kilgore. The bypass had been proposed as early as 1965, but funding did not become available until the late 1990s. The new bypass was designated as US-259, while the previous route through the Kilgore business district was designated as a business route. The new business route was approved by the AASHO in September 2006. =Idabel bypass= Formerly, US-259 continued into downtown Idabel, and the southeast portion of the Idabel bypass was double-designated as US-70 Bypass and US-259 Bypass. On 6 March 2000, the bypass route was decommissioned, and mainline US-259 was moved onto the bypass. However, , some bypass signage is still in place, including signage indicating the former terminus of Bypass US-259 at US-70/SH-3. =SH-259A= SH-259A, an Oklahoma state highway, is a loop to Broken Bow Lake and Beavers Bend Resort Park north of Broken Bow, Oklahoma. It lies partially in the Ouachita National Forest and is occasionally signed as a U.S. highway.

The U.S. Highway runs from US 58 Business, Virginia State Route 293 (SR 293), and SR 360 in Danville east to SR 644 in Reedville. US 360 connects Danville, South Boston, and Keysville in Southside Virginia with the state capital of Richmond. The U.S. Highway also connects Richmond with Tappahannock on the Middle Peninsula and the eastern Northern Neck, where the highway serves as the primary route through Northumberland County. US 360 is a four-lane divided highway for almost all of its length. Route description =Danville to Keysville= US 360 begins at a four-way intersection on the north side of the Dan River opposite downtown Danville. Main Street heads south across the river into downtown Danville as SR 293 and north as SR 293 and SR 360, the latter highway being the old alignment of US 360 from Danville to east of South Boston. The west leg of the intersection is Riverside Drive, which is followed by US 58 Business. US 360 heads east along four-lane divided River Street with US 58 Business and passes under Norfolk Southern Railway's Danville District rail line. The highway's name changes to South Boston Highway on crossing Fall Creek and veering away from the Dan River. US 360 reaches the eastern end of its concurrency with US 58 Business and joins with US 58 at the highway's cloverleaf interchange with US 29 (Danville Expressway). US 360 and US 58 leave the city of Danville after passing along the north side of Danville Regional Airport. US 360 and US 58 meet the northern end of SR 62 (Milton Highway) in eastern Pittsylvania County before entering Halifax County. The highway's name changes to Philpott Road and it crosses the Dan River. US 360 and US 58 pass through the hamlets of Delila, where the U.S. Highways meet the northern end of SR 119 (Calvary Road) and Turbeville before reaching the community of Riverdale on the south side of the Dan River opposite South Boston. The U.S. Highways have a grade crossing of Norfolk Southern's Durham District rail line and intersect US 501 (Huell Matthews Highway), where the highways begin to follow Bill Tuck Highway. A short distance east of US 501, US 360 and US 58 diverge, with the former highway turning north onto James D. Hagood Highway to cross the Dan River and Norfolk Southern's Danville-Richmond rail line. On entering the town of South Boston, US 360 follows John Randolph Boulevard and has intersections with the eastern ends of SR 304 (Seymour Drive) and SR 34 (Hodges Street). After leaving South Boston, US 360 becomes James D. Hagood Highway again, which heads northeast past South Boston Speedway and William M. Tuck Airport. The U.S. Highway crosses the Banister River at Terrys Bridge and meets the coincident termini of SR 360 (Bethel Road) and SR 344 (Scottsburg Road) near Scottsburg. US 360 crosses over the Danville-Richmond rail line and meets the western end of SR 92 (Clover Road) south of the town of Clover. The U.S. Highway crosses the Roanoke River into Charlotte County and follows Kings Highway, which intersects SR 92 (Jeb Stuart Highway) again and US 15 (Barnesville Highway) at Wylliesburg. US 360 and US 15 run concurrently north through Crafton Gate, where the highways intersect SR 47 (Craftons Gate Highway). South of Keysville, at the southern end of US 15 Business and US 360 Business (Old Kings Highway), the highway becomes a freeway. US 15 and US 360 cross over the Virginia Southern Railroad and have a partial interchange with the business routes. Just east of the town of Keysville, the U.S. Highways have a diamond interchange with SR 40 (Lunenburg County Highway). US 15 and US 360 pass under the Virginia Southern rail line before diverging at a partial cloverleaf interchange that also marks the northern end of their respective business routes. =Keysville to Richmond= US 360 briefly runs atop the Prince Edward - Lunenburg county line before fully entering Prince Edward County, where the highway parallels the Virginia Southern Railroad to the south and Norfolk Southern Railway's Blue Ridge District to the north. The U.S. Highway passes through the communities of Bruceville and Meherrin, where the highway crosses to the north side of the Blue Ridge rail line. As US 360 passes through Meherrin, the highway briefly enters into Lunenburg County before reentering Prince Edward County, although no signs mark the county line there. US 360 begins to parallel the two rail lines at Green Bay, where the road temporarily becomes undivided. The U.S. Highway parallels both rail lines to Burkeville, a town in the southwestern corner of Nottoway County where the highway's name changes to Patrick Henry Highway. US 360 crosses over the Farmville Belt Line, a part of the Blue Ridge District that serves Farmville and joins the main Blue Ridge line in Burkeville. Just north of the rail crossing, the U.S. Highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 460 (Colonial Trail Highway) and US 360 Business and US 460 Business, which parallel the rail line into town as 2nd Street. US 360 and US 460 bypass the town to the north and receive the eastern end of their respective business routes before diverging at a partial interchange. There is no direct access from westbound US 360 to eastbound US 460 or from westbound US 460 to eastbound US 360; those movements are made via SR 723 (Lewiston Plank Road) or SR 49 (Watson Wood Rd). US 360 parallels Norfolk Southern's Richmond District rail line northeast from Burkeville. The highway meets the northern end of SR 49 (Watsons Wood Road) before entering Amelia County. West of Jetersville, the highway intersects the eastern end of SR 307 (Holly Farms Road), which connects to US 460 northwest of Burkeville. US 360 continues to Amelia Court House, which is directly served by US 360 Business (Goodes Bridge Road). North of the county seat, the U.S. Highway crosses the rail line and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with its business route before receiving the northern end of the business route west of Winterham, where the highway and railroad diverge. US 360 has a junction with SR 153 (Military Road) between Winterham and the Appomattox River, where the highway enters Chesterfield County. US 360 becomes Hull Street Road and passes through the village of Skinquarter before entering the suburban area surrounding Richmond. The U.S. Highway expands to eight lanes through Woodlake and crosses Swift Creek just downstream from the dam that holds back Swift Creek Reservoir west of the highway's cloverleaf interchange with SR 288. US 360 continues northeast as a six-lane highway through more suburban areas before its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 150 (Chippenham Parkway), where the U.S. Highway enters the city of Richmond and reduces to four lanes. The U.S. Highway crosses CSX's North End Subdivision and becomes Hull Street at its intersection with SR 161 (Belt Boulevard). US 360 heads into the Manchester section of Richmond as a four-lane undivided highway that has intersections with SR 10 (Broad Rock Road), Midlothian Turnpike, and US 1 and US 301, which head south toward Petersburg as Jefferson Davis Highway and north toward their James River crossing as Cowardin Street. US 360 passes the Art Works artist colony before passing over Norfolk Southern crossing the James River on the Mayo Bridge, which crosses Mayo Island in the middle of the river. US 360 reaches the north side of the river just west of the Triple Crossing; the highway passes under the east-west viaduct of CSX's Rivanna Subdivision and has a grade crossing of Norfolk Southern's Richmond District. The U.S. Highway passes under SR 195 (Downtown Expressway) follows 14th Street into the Shockoe Bottom neighborhood, where US 360 turns east onto Main Street, which carries US 60 and the GRTC Pulse bus rapid transit line. The two highways pass under I-95 (Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike) and CSX's Bellwood Subdivision and by the Main Street Station serving Amtrak's Northeast Regional trains during their four-block concurrency. =Richmond to Reedville= View east along US 360 in Tappahannock US 360 turns northeast onto 18th Street at Mason's Hall to pass along the west edge of the Church Hill neighborhood. At Grace Street, the highway splits into a one-way pair; westbound US 360 follows 17th Street. The U.S. Highway meets the eastern end of US 250 (Broad Street), then curves north and passes under the Leigh Street Viaduct, which carries SR 33. The two directions of US 360 come together one block before the highway turns east onto Fairfield Way. The U.S. Highway turns north onto four-lane undivided Mechanicsville Turnpike and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-64 before exiting the city of Richmond as a six-lane divided highway. US 360 passes through the Henrico County community of East Highland Park, where the highway intersects Laburnum Avenue, which leads to Richmond Raceway. The U.S. Highway crosses the Chickahominy River into Hanover County, where the highway reduces to four lanes at the southern end of Mechanicsville's US 360 Business. While on the Mechanicsville Bypass, US 360 has a diamond interchange with SR 156 (Cold Harbor Road). The movement from westbound US 360 to SR 156 is provided at the northern end of the bypass, which occurs a short distance south of US 360's cloverleaf interchange with I-295. Northeast of I-295, US 360 gradually transitions from suburban to rural surroundings. The transition is complete by the time the U.S. Highway crosses the Pamunkey River into King William County, where the highway's name changes to Richmond-Tappahannock Highway. US 360 passes through Manquin and Central Garage, where the highway intersects SR 30 (King William Road). At Aylett, the site of Zoar State Forest, the U.S. Highway crosses the Mattaponi River into King and Queen County, where the highway meets the western end of SR 14 at the community of St. Stephens Church. US 360 enters Essex County at Miller's Tavern where the highway crosses the watershed divide between the York River tributaries and the Rappahannock River. The U.S. Highway is named Richmond Highway northeast past Tappahannock-Essex County Airport to Brays Fork, where the highway meets US 17 (Tidewater Trail) at a directional intersection. The U.S. Highways run concurrently into the town of Tappahannock. Within the town, US 17 and US 360 cross Hoskins Creek and become a four-lane undivided highway. On the north side of the downtown area, US 360 turns east onto two-lane Queen Street and crosses the Rappahannock River on a high-level two-lane bridge. US 360 expands to a four-lane divided highway on arriving in Richmond County. The U.S. Highway heads east as Richmond Road past the historic plantation Mount Airy to the town of Warsaw. In the center of town, through which US 360 is an undivided highway, the highway runs concurrently with SR 3 Business from Main Street to SR 3 (Historyland Highway). US 360 expands to a divided highway at the hamlet of Indian Field and passes through Haynesville before entering Northumberland County at Village. The U.S. Highway veers northeast at Luttrellville and meets the eastern end of SR 202 (Hampton Hall Road) in Callao. At SR 202, US 360 turns east onto Northumberland Highway, which is two lanes within the unincorporated village. The U.S. Highway briefly expands to a four-lane divided highway but is two lanes through Lottsburg. US 360 has another divided highway section before reducing to two lanes through Heathsville, where the highway passes St. Stephen's Episcopal Church and intersects SR 201 (Courthouse Road). The highway passes through Claraville, Horse Head, and Downings Corner before reaching its junction with SR 200 (Jesse DuPont Memorial Highway) at Burgess. US 360 has its final four-lane divided section between Folly and Lilian. At Beverlyville, the U.S. Highway curves south toward Reedville. At SR 657 (Fleeton Road), the U.S. Highway follows Main Street south to its eastern terminus at the intersection of Main Street and Reed Avenue, which are both part of SR 644. Major intersections Special routes =Keysville business route= View north along US 15 Bus. and east along US 360 Bus. northeast of SR 622 just south of Keysville U.S. Route 360 Business (US 360 Business) is a business route of US 360 in Charlotte County. The highway, which runs between junctions with US 360 and US 15 south and north of Keysville, is entirely concurrent with US 15 Business. =Burkeville business route= US 360 Bus. and US 460 Bus. at SR 716 just west of Burkeville U.S. Route 360/460 Business (US 360/460 Bus.) is a shared business route of US 360 and US 460 in Nottoway County. The highway runs between junctions with US 360 and US 460 west and east of Burkeville. US 360/460 Business begins at the partial cloverleaf interchange where the two highways begin to run concurrently west of Burkeville. There is no direct access from the westbound bypass to the eastbound business routes. The business routes pass through the town as 2nd Street before rejoining US 360 and US 460 a short distance west of their eastern divergence point. =Amelia Court House business route= US 360 Bus. at SR 1009 in Amelia Court House U.S. Route 360 Business (US 360 Business) is a business route of US 360 in Amelia County. The highway runs between junctions with US 360 west and north of Amelia Court House. US 360 Business follows Goodes Bridge Road parallel to Norfolk Southern Railway's Richmond District along the northwest side of the village center, where the highway meets the western end of SR 38 (Virginia Street). North of the village, the business route has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 360 before reaching its northern terminus at the mainline U.S. Highway. =Mechanicsville business route= View west along US 360 Bus. at SR 156 and SR 638 in Mechanicsville U.S. Route 360 Business (US 360 Business) is a business route of US 360 in Hanover County. The highway runs between junctions with US 360 west and east of Mechanicsville. The business route begins as a one-way westbound ramp to westbound US 360. US 360 Business gains an eastbound lane and heads east as Mechanicsville Turnpike to an intersection with SR 156 (Cold Harbor Road) and SR 638 (Atlee Road). The business route continues a few more blocks before again becoming a one-way westbound ramp from westbound US 360. This westbound ramp is used to access SR 156 from westbound US 360 because there is no direct ramp in US 360's diamond interchange with SR 156.

A wrestling mask is a fabric based mask that some professional wrestlers wear as part of their in-ring persona or gimmick. Professional wrestlers have been using masks as far back as 1915 and they are still widely used today, especially in Lucha Libre in Mexico. History At the 1865 World's Fair, Theobaud Bauer debuted the mask, wrestling as \\"The Masked Wrestler\\" in Paris, France. He continued wrestling using the mask throughout France as part of a circus troupe in the 1860s before moving on the United States in the early 1870s. In 1915 Mort Henderson started wrestling as the \\"Masked Marvel\\" in the New York area making him the first North American wrestler to perform with such a gimmick. In the subsequent years many wrestlers would put on a mask after they had been used in an area, or territory, that their popularity and drawing ability diminished, it would be an easy way for a wrestler to begin working in a new area as a \\"fresh face\\". Sometimes workers wore masks in one territory and unmasked in another territory in order to keep their two identities separate. =The mask in the US and Canada= Many wrestlers have had very successful careers while masked such as The Destroyer/Dr. X, Mr. Wrestling, Masked Superstar and the Spoiler. In the days where professional wrestling was more regional, with less national television coverage, it was not uncommon for more than one person or team to use the same gimmick and mask, and there have at times been several masked \\"Interns\\", \\"Assassins\\" and \\"Executioners\\" working simultaneously. Tag team wrestling has seen more masked teams, using identical masks to create unity between wrestlers. Successful masked teams include the Masked Assassins, Blue Infernos and the Grapplers. One of the best-known North American masked wrestlers was Big Van Vader, who was also known for his in- ring agility despite his large frame during the 1980s and 90s. Other notable examples are Rey Mysterio, Mankind, Kane, Edge & Christian as 'Los Conquistadores' & Owen Hart as 'Blue Blazer'. Today, masked wrestlers are not a common sight in the United States and Canada, but masked wrestlers have a long history in that region, dating back to 1915. A mask sometimes will be used by a well known wrestler in a storyline where they must get around various \\"stipulations\\" or betray a trust without revealing their true identity. For instance wrestlers who are suspended in a storyline return under a mask under another name, usually with it being very obvious who is under the mask. Examples of this include: Hulk Hogan as Mr. America, Dusty Rhodes as The Midnight Rider, Andr√© the Giant as Giant Machine, Brian Pillman as The Yellow Dog, The Miz as The Calgary Kid, Dan Marsh as Mr. X and Bo Dallas as Mr. NXT. Jimmy Valiant once returned under a mask as Charlie Brown from Outta Town after losing to Paul Jones in a \\"Loser Leaves Town\\" match (a stipulation where the loser of the match must resign from the organization for which he worked). Mickie James also revealed to be under the mask when she returned to WWE as Alexa Bliss's partner. =The mask in Lucha Libre= Mascarita Sagrada wearing a mask that covers his entire face. It is a common misconception that masks in Lucha Libre spring from the Aztec, Inca or Mayan tradition but the mask, or \\"M√°scara\\" in Spanish, was first introduced in Mexico when a promoter saw American wrestler \\"Cyclone\\" McKey working in Texas and decided to bring McKey to work for his promotion, Empresa Mexicana de la Lucha Libre (EMLL). The Mexican fanbase quickly took to the mystery of the masked man and soon after Mexican wrestlers themselves started wearing masks, becoming \\"Enmascarados\\". Early masks were simplistic with strong, basic colors designs that could be recognized even in the back row of the arena. Over the years the masks evolved to become very intricate and colorful drawing on Mexico's rich history. Unlike in other parts of North America the popularity of the masked wrestlers has not waned over the years, with souvenir masks being sold at events and online. In modern lucha libre, masks are colorfully designed to evoke the images of animals, gods, ancient heroes, and other archetypes, whose identity the luchador takes on during a performance. Most wrestlers in Mexico start their career wearing a mask, but over the span of their careers a substantial number of them will be unmasked. Sometimes, a wrestler slated for retirement will be unmasked in one of his final bouts or at the beginning of a final tour, signifying loss of identity as that character. Sometimes, losing the mask signifies the end of a gimmick with the wrestler moving on to a new gimmick and mask, often without public acknowledgement of the wrestler's previous persona. The wrestling mask is considered \\"sacred\\", so much so that the intentional removal of a mask is grounds for disqualification. If a wrestler is unmasked during the match their top priority is to cover up their face and usually gets help from people at ringside to hide his face. Most masked wrestlers wear their masks for any and all public appearances using the mask to keep their personal life separate from their professional life. Because of the mask most Mexican wrestlers also enjoy a higher degree of anonymity about their personal life. Some wrestlers become larger than life characters such as El Santo, one of the most popular cultural icons who always wore his mask in public, revealed his face only briefly in old age, and was even buried in his trademark silver mask. Luchas de Apuestas In Lucha Libre the highest achievement is not winning a championship but winning the mask of an opponent in a \\"Luchas de Apuestas\\" match, a \\"bet fight\\" where each wrestler bets their mask. The Luchas de Apuestas match is usually seen as the culmination of a long and heated storyline between two or more wrestlers with the winner getting the \\"ultimate victory‚Äù. It is customary for the loser of such a match to reveal his real name, where he's from and how long he has been a wrestler before taking the mask off to show his face. Unmasked wrestlers will wager their hair instead, risking having his or her head shaved bald in case of defeat. There can be several reasons to book a \\"Luchas de Apuestas\\" match beyond the obvious purpose of elevating the winner. If the loser is a younger wrestler then the loss of the mask can sometimes lead to a promotional push after unmasking, or the wrestler is being given a new ring persona. Older wrestlers often lose their masks during the last couple of years of their career, often for a big payday depending on how long and successful a career they've had, The more successful the wrestler that's unmasked the bigger the honor for the winner. The first luchas de apuestas match was presented on July 14, 1940 at Arena M√©xico. The defending champion Murci√©lago was so much lighter than his challenger Octavio that he requested a further condition before he would sign the contract: Octavio would have to put his hair on the line. Octavio won the match and Murci√©lago unmasked, giving birth to a tradition in lucha libre. A wrestling mask mural in Madrid, Spain. High profiled \\"Luchas de Apuestas\\" include El Santo winning the mask of Black Spirit, Los Villanos winning the masks of all three Los Brazos (El Brazo, Brazo de Oro and Brazo de Plata), Atlantis winning the mask of Villano III, La Parka unmasking both Cibern√©tico andad El Mesias, Villano V taking Blue Panther's mask and √öltimo Guerrero winning the mask of Villano V. Some wrestlers have made a career by the volume of masks they have won rather than the general quality of their opponents‚Äîwrestler Super Mu√±eco claims to have won over 100 masks, with at least 80 verifiable \\"Luchas de Apuestas\\" wins, while Estrella Blanca is said to have the most Luchas de Apuestas with over 200 masks won. =The mask in Japanese wrestling= The Destroyer, an American, was the first masked wrestler to work in Japan during the 1960s but remained a novelty with very few Japanese wrestlers choosing to wear a mask. In the 1970s Mil M√°scaras became the first Mexican Luchador to work on a regular basis and became very popular with the fans. The original Tiger Mask, Satoru Sayama was inspired by Mil M√°scaras to create the masked \\"Tiger Mask\\" persona. After the success of Tiger Mask several wrestlers have adopted the mask, mainly lighter wrestlers who like Sayama had a more high flying and flashy style. The wrestling mask is held in more regard by the Japanese fans than the North American fans but isn't as \\"sacred\\" as the Mexican mask, meaning that the wrestler can perform both masked one day and unmasked another if he so wishes. Famous Japanese masked wrestlers include Jyushin Thunder Liger, √öltimo Drag√≥n, El Samurai, The Great Sasuke, Dragon Kid and Bushi. Anatomy of the wrestling mask The mask of Blue Demon, traditional full face cover with white trim / \\"Antifaz\\" The original wrestling masks were often masks attached to a top that snapped in the groin making it very uncomfortable for the people wearing it. If the masks were not attached to the top, then they were made from uncomfortable material such as brushed pig skin, leather or suede. In the 1930s, a Mexican shoe maker called Antonio Martinez created a mask on request from Charro Aguayo that became the standard for wrestling masks created since then. The basic design consists of four pieces of fabric sewn together to create the basic shape that covers the entire head. The mask has openings for the eyes, nose and mouth with colorful trim around the open features, this trim is known as \\"Antifaz\\" in Spanish. The back of the mask is open with a \\"tongue\\" of fabric under laces to keep it tight enough to not come off accidentally during a match. The first variation in style came when the jaw and mouth area was removed from the mask to expose the skin. Other masks have solid material over the mouth, nose, eyes or all three, in the case of fabric covering the eyes a stretched fabric that is see through up-close is used. Originally being made from fabric masks have evolved and are now made from a variety of materials from cotton to nylon to various vinyls in many different colours and patterns. Several additions have been made to the mask decorations over the years with the most prevalent and visually striking being foam horns and artificial hair attached to the mask. Mock ears are also commonly used, especially if the mask has an animal motif such as a tiger.

Similarly MESS was not considered to be open source software if appraised according to the criteria of the Open Source Definition.  Challenges  Generally the emulation only includes raw hardware logic, such as for the CPU and RAM, and specialized DSPs such as tone generators or video sprites. The MESS emulator does not include any programming code stored in ROM chips from the emulated computer, since this may be copyrighted software. Obtaining the ROM data by oneself directly from the hardware being emulated can be extremely difficult, technical, and expensive, since it may require desoldering of integrated circuit chips from the circuit board of the device they own. The desoldered IC is placed into a chip reader device connected to a USB or serial port of another computer, with pin sockets on the reader specifically designed to match the chip package shape in question, to perform a memory dump of the ROM to a data file. Removal of a soldered chip is often far easier than reinstalling it, especially for extremely small surface mount technology chips, and the emulated device in question may be effectively destroyed beyond recovery after the ROM has been removed for reading. However, if one has a working system, it is far easier to dump the ROM data to tape, disk, etc. and transfer the data file to one's target machine.

It currently runs for 655 miles (1,054 km) from Norfolk, Virginia, at its parent route U.S. Route 60 at Ocean View to Frankfort, Kentucky, at its parent route once again. It passes through the states of Virginia, West Virginia, and to Frankfort, Kentucky, the state capital. It goes through the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Petersburg, Farmville, Lynchburg, Roanoke, Blacksburg, Tazewell, and Grundy, in Virginia; Princeton and Bluefield in West Virginia; and Pikeville, and Frankfort, Kentucky. The section from Interstate 81 at Christiansburg, Virginia, to U.S. Route 23 in Pikeville, Kentucky, is Corridor Q in the Appalachian Development Highway System. The portion improved under this system is unfinished between Grundy, Virginia, and Pikeville. US 460 is a major east- west highway in Virginia. It is a major thoroughfare through southern Hampton Roads and connects the area to Petersburg. US 460 connects Lynchburg to Roanoke. US 460 is paired with US 221 between Bedford and Roanoke and with US 11 between Salem and Christiansburg. It is also the primary east-west roadway in the northern part of Southwest Virginia between Christiansburg and the Kentucky border; several miles near Bluefield pass through West Virginia. Route description =Kentucky= U. S. Route 460 runs through downtown Georgetown, Kentucky. US 460 now begins when it splits from US 60 a few miles east of downtown Frankfort. It is a winding two-lane highway with no shoulders and intersects US 62 and I-75 at Georgetown. It proceeds to Paris, where it serves as the town's \\"Main Street\\" and intersects US 27 and US 68. The next major intersection is with I-64 in Mount Sterling. It proceeds through Frenchburg and West Liberty. In Salyersville, the Mountain Parkway ends by merging onto it. It is a 3-lane highway for 14 miles and then it merges with US 23 in Paintsville. US 460 East follows US-23 South through Prestonsburg and Pikeville. The route enters the southwestern part of Virginia. =Virginia and West Virginia= US 460 eastbound at WV 598 in Bluefield, West Virginia U.S. Route 460 runs east-west through the southern part of the Virginia. It has two separate pieces in Virginia, joined by a relatively short section in West Virginia. Most of US 460 is a four-lane divided highway. US 460 from Interstate 81 at Christiansburg west to Pikeville, Kentucky, including the piece in West Virginia, is Corridor Q of the Appalachian Development Highway System. From West Virginia east to I-81, US 460 is also part of the proposed Interstate 73. History The earliest origins of this road were as part of the track once known as the Trader's Path, a Virginia colonial trail dating from the 17th century that led from Augusta County to present-day Roanoke.Frazier Associates. 1992. \\"Historical Architecture Reconnaissance Survey Report. Roanoke, Virginia.\\" April 1992. Page 2. Before it was commissioned as a federally designated route in the late 1940s, US 460 was designated as Kentucky Route 4 from the western Virginia state line near Grundy to Millard, Kentucky. It was Kentucky Route 40 from Paintsville to Lexington. Fun Facts About Kentucky Highways: US 460 In the pre-Interstate era, US 460 was a major highway, passing from Frankfort through Louisville, Kentucky and Evansville, Indiana, and ending in St. Louis, Missouri, after crossing the MacArthur Bridge. Interstate 64 has supplanted most of old US 460 as a more direct route. The stretch through Indiana and Illinois was eliminated in November 1976. Old US 460 has been redesignated in these areas as parts of State Road 66 and State Road 62 in Indiana; and part of Illinois Route 15, Illinois Route 142, and Illinois Route 14 in that state. However, its parent route, US 60 has not been supplanted by I-64 and converted to a state highway in the greater Louisville area. Many years after the road's elimination in Indiana in 1977, some older residents and even businesses along what is now Indiana State Road 62 still refer to the road as \\"Highway 460.\\" Older billboards retain that designation in the St. Meinrad area. Some current telephone books also contain listings for those living on \\"Hwy 460.\\" When Fishtrap Lake was created in Pike County, Kentucky, US 460 was realigned to its current route from Salyersville to Paintsville. The former US 460 leading to the lake is now Kentucky Routes 1499 and 1789. The part between Paintsville and Millard remained U.S. Highway 23 and Kentucky Route 80.July 4 2006 Roadtrip Major intersections ;Kentucky : in Frankfort : in Georgetown : in Georgetown : in Georgetown : in Paris : in Mt.

Most of the Japanese task force was destroyed, and Japanese troop losses were heavy. The Japanese convoy was a result of a Japanese Imperial General Headquarters decision in December 1942 to reinforce their position in the South West Pacific. A plan was devised to move some 6,900 troops from Rabaul directly to Lae. The plan was understood to be risky, because Allied air power in the area was strong, but it was decided to proceed because otherwise the troops would have to be landed a considerable distance away and march through inhospitable swamp, mountain and jungle terrain without roads before reaching their destination. On 28 February 1943, the convoy ‚Äì comprising eight destroyers and eight troop transports with an escort of approximately 100 fighter aircraft ‚Äì set out from Simpson Harbour in Rabaul. The Allies had detected preparations for the convoy, and naval codebreakers in Melbourne (FRUMEL) and Washington, D.C., had decrypted and translated messages indicating the convoy's intended destination and date of arrival. The Allied Air Forces had developed new techniques they hoped would improve the chances of successful air attack on ships. They detected and shadowed the convoy, which came under sustained air attack on 2‚Äì3 March 1943. Follow-up attacks by PT boats and aircraft were made on 4 March. All eight transports and four of the escorting destroyers were sunk. Of 6,900 troops who were badly needed in New Guinea, only about 1,200 made it to Lae. Another 2,700 were rescued by destroyers and submarines and returned to Rabaul. The Japanese made no further attempts to reinforce Lae by ship, greatly hindering their ultimately unsuccessful efforts to stop Allied offensives in New Guinea. Background =Allied offensives= Six months after Imperial Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the United States won a strategic victory at the Battle of Midway in June 1942. Seizing the strategic initiative, the United States and its Allies landed on Guadalcanal in the southern Solomon Islands in August 1942, beginning the Solomon Islands Campaign. The battle for Guadalcanal ended in victory for the Allies with the withdrawal of Japanese forces from the island in early February 1943. At the same time, Australian and American forces in New Guinea repelled the Japanese land offensive along the Kokoda Track. Going on the offensive, the Allied forces captured Buna‚ÄìGona, destroying Japanese forces in that area. The ultimate goal of the Allied counter-offensives in New Guinea and the Solomons was to capture the main Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain, later codified as Operation Cartwheel, and clear the way for the eventual reconquest of the Philippines. Recognising the threat, the Japanese continued to send land, naval, and aerial reinforcements to the area in an attempt to check the Allied advances. =Japanese plans= Reviewing the progress of the Battle of Guadalcanal and the Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona in December 1942, the Japanese faced the prospect that neither could be held. Accordingly, Imperial General Headquarters decided to take steps to strengthen the Japanese position in the South West Pacific by sending Lieutenant General Jusei Aoki's 20th Division from Korea to Guadalcanal and Lieutenant General Heisuke Abe's 41st Division from China to Rabaul. Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura, the commander of the Japanese Eighth Area Army at Rabaul, ordered Lieutenant General Hataz≈ç Adachi's XVIII Army to secure Madang, Wewak and Tuluvu in New Guinea. On 29 December, Adachi ordered the 102nd Infantry Regiment and other units under the command of Major General Toru Okabe, the commander of the infantry group of the 51st Division, to move from Rabaul to Lae and advance inland to capture Wau. After deciding to evacuate Guadalcanal on 4 January, the Japanese switched priorities from the Solomon Islands to New Guinea, and opted to send the 20th and 41st Divisions to Wewak. A alt=A propellor aircraft on display in a museum. The wing tips are folded up. On 5 January 1943, the convoy, which consisted of five destroyers and five troop transports carrying Okabe's force, set out for Lae from Rabaul. Forewarned by Ultra, United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft spotted, shadowed and attacked the convoy, which was shielded by low clouds and Japanese fighters. The Allies claimed to have shot down 69 Japanese aircraft for the loss of 10 of their own. An RAAF Consolidated PBY Catalina sank the transport . Although destroyers rescued 739 of the 1,100 troops on board, the ship took with it all of Okabe's medical supplies. Another transport, , was so badly damaged at Lae by USAAF North American B-25 Mitchells that it had to be beached. Nonetheless, the convoy succeeded in reaching Lae on 7 January and landing its troops, but Okabe was defeated in the Battle of Wau. Most of the 20th Division was landed at Wewak from naval high speed transports on 19 January 1943. The bulk of the 41st Division followed on 12 February. Imamura and Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa, the commander of the South East Area Fleet, developed a plan to move the command post of the headquarters of the Japanese XVIII Army and the main body of the 51st Division from Rabaul to Lae on 3 March, followed by moving the remainder of the 20th Division to Madang on 10 March. This plan was acknowledged to be risky because Allied air power in the area was strong. The XVIII Army staff held war games that predicted losses of four out of ten transports, and between 30 and 40 aircraft. They gave the operation only a 50‚Äì50 chance of success. On the other hand, if the troops were landed at Madang, they faced a march of more than over inhospitable swamp, mountain and jungle terrain without roads. To augment the three naval and two army fighter groups in the area assigned to protect the convoy, the Imperial Japanese Navy temporarily detached 18 fighters from the aircraft carrier 's fighter group from Truk to Kavieng. =Allied intelligence= The Allies soon began detecting signs of preparations for a new convoy. A Japanese floatplane of the type normally used for anti-submarine patrols in advance of convoys was sighted on 7 February 1943. The Allied Air Forces South West Pacific Area commander ‚Äì Lieutenant General George Kenney ‚Äì ordered an increase in reconnaissance patrols over Rabaul. On 14 February, aerial photographs were taken that showed 79 vessels in port, including 45 merchant ships and six transports. It was clear that another convoy was being prepared, but its destination was unknown. On 16 February, naval codebreakers in Melbourne (FRUMEL) and Washington, D.C. finished decrypting and translating a coded message revealing the Japanese intention to land convoys at Wewak, Madang and Lae. Subsequently, codebreakers decrypted a message from the Japanese 11th Air Fleet to the effect that destroyers and six transports would reach Lae about 5 March. Another report indicated that they would reach Lae by 12 March. On 22 February, reconnaissance aircraft reported 59 merchant vessels in the harbour at Rabaul. Kenney read this Ultra intelligence in the office of the Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area ‚Äì General Douglas MacArthur ‚Äì on 25 February. The prospect of an additional 6,900 Japanese troops in the Lae area greatly disturbed MacArthur, as they might seriously affect his plans to capture and develop the area. Kenney wrote out orders, which were sent by courier, for Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead, the deputy commander of the Fifth Air Force, and the commander of its Advance Echelon (ADVON) in New Guinea. Under the Fifth Air Force's unusual command arrangements, Whitehead controlled the Allied Air Forces units of all types in New Guinea. This included the RAAF units there, which were grouped as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, under the command of Air Commodore Joe Hewitt. Kenney informed Whitehead of the proposed convoy date, and warned him about the usual Japanese pre-convoy air attack. He also urged that flying hours be cut back so as to allow for a large strike on the convoy, and instructed him to move forward as many aircraft as possible so that they could be close to the nearby captured airfields around Dobodura, where they would not be subject to the vagaries of weather over the Owen Stanley Range. Kenney flew up to Port Moresby on 26 February, where he met with Whitehead. The two generals inspected fighter and bomber units in the area, and agreed to attack the Japanese convoy in the Vitiaz Strait. Kenney returned to Brisbane on 28 February. Allied tactics In the South West Pacific, a conventional strategic bombing campaign was out of the question, as industrial targets in Japan were well beyond the range of even the largest strategic bombers operating from bases in Australia and New Guinea. Therefore, the primary mission of the Allied bomber force was interdiction of Japanese supply lines, especially the sea lanes. The results of the effort against the Japanese convoy in January were very disappointing; some 416 sorties had been flown with only two ships sunk and three damaged, so clearly, a change of tactics was in order. Group Captain Bill Garing, an RAAF officer on Kenney's staff with considerable experience in air-sea operations, including a tour of duty in Europe, recommended that Japanese convoys be subjected to simultaneous attack from different altitudes and directions. Captain Robert L. Faurot of the alt=Man standing in front of a twin-propeller aircraft Major Paul I. \\"Pappy\\" Gunn and his men at the 81st Depot Repair Squadron in Townsville, Queensland, modified some USAAF Douglas A-20 Havoc light bombers by installing four machine guns in their noses in September 1942. Two fuel tanks were added, giving the aircraft more range. An attempt was then made in December 1942 to create a longer range attack aircraft by doing the same thing to a B-25 medium bomber to convert it to a \\"commerce destroyer\\", but this proved to be somewhat more difficult. The resulting aircraft was nose-heavy despite added lead ballast in the tail, and the vibrations caused by firing the machine guns were enough to make rivets pop out of the skin of the aircraft. The tail guns and belly turrets were removed, the latter being of little use if the aircraft was flying low. The new tactic of having the B-25 strafe ships would be tried in this battle. The Allied Air Forces also adopted other innovative tactics. In February 1942, the RAAF began experimenting with skip bombing, an anti- shipping technique used by the British and Germans. Flying only a few dozen feet above the sea toward their targets, bombers would release their bombs which would then, ideally, ricochet across the surface of the water and explode at the side of the target ship, under it, or just over it. A similar technique was mast-height bombing, in which bombers would approach the target at low altitude, , at about , and then drop down to mast height, at about from the target. They would release their bombs at around , aiming directly at the side of the ship. The Battle of the Bismarck Sea would demonstrate that this was the more successful of the two tactics. The two techniques were not mutually exclusive: a bomber could drop two bombs, skipping the first and launching the second at mast height. Practice missions were carried out against the wreck of the , a liner that had run aground in 1923. The Fifth Air Force had two heavy bomber groups. The 43rd Bombardment Group was equipped with about 55 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. Most of these had seen hard war service over the previous six months and the availability rate was low. The recently arrived 90th Bombardment Group was equipped with Consolidated B-24 Liberators, but they too had maintenance problems. There were two medium groups: the 38th Bombardment Group, equipped with B-25 Mitchells, and the 22nd Bombardment Group, equipped with Martin B-26 Marauders, but two of the former's four squadrons had been diverted to the South Pacific Area, and the latter had taken so many losses that it had been withdrawn to Australia to be rebuilt. There was also a light group, the 3rd Attack Group, equipped with a mixture of Douglas A-20 Havocs and B-25 Mitchells. This group was not just short of aircraft; it was critically short of aircrew as well. To make up the numbers the USAAF turned to the RAAF for help. Australian aircrew were assigned to most of the group's aircraft, serving in every role except aircraft commander. In addition to the RAAF aircrew with the USAAF squadrons, there were RAAF units in the Port Moresby area. No. 30 Squadron RAAF, which had arrived in Port Moresby in September 1942, was equipped with the Bristol Beaufighter. Both the aircraft and the squadron proved adept at low level attacks. Also in the Port Moresby area were the 35th and 49th Fighter Groups, both equipped with Bell P-39, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters, but only the last were suitable for long range escort missions.

Guadalcanal is at the lower right, Rabaul in the upper center, and Port Moresby, Buna, and Gona in the lower left. =Order of battle= see Battle of the Bismarck Sea order of battle =First attacks= The Japanese convoy ‚Äì comprising eight destroyers and eight troop transports with an escort of approximately 100 fighters ‚Äì assembled and departed from Simpson Harbour in Rabaul on 28 February. During the January operation, a course was followed that hugged the south coast of New Britain. This had made it easy to provide air cover, but being close to the airfields also made it possible for the Allied Air Forces to attack both the convoy and the airfields at the same time. This time, a route was chosen along the north coast, in the hope that the Allies would be deceived into thinking that the convoy's objective was Madang. Allied air attacks on the convoy at this point would have to fly over New Britain, allowing interdiction from Japanese air bases there, but the final leg of the voyage would be particularly dangerous, because the convoy would have to negotiate the restricted waters of the Vitiaz Strait. The Japanese named the convoy \\"Operation 81.\\" alt=A ship under way, with splashes on both sides. The destroyers carried 958 troops while the transports took 5,954. All the ships were combat loaded to expedite unloading at Lae. The commander of the Japanese XVIII Army ‚Äì Lieutenant General Hataz≈ç Adachi ‚Äì travelled on the destroyer , while that of the 51st Division ‚Äì Lieutenant General Hidemitsu Nakano ‚Äì was on board the destroyer . The escort commander ‚Äì Rear Admiral Masatomi Kimura of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla ‚Äì flew his flag from the destroyer . The other five destroyers were , , , and . They escorted seven Army transports: (2,716 gross register tons), (950 tons), (5,493 tons), (6,494 tons), (3,793 tons), (2,883 tons) and (6,870 tons). Rounding out the force was the lone Navy transport (8,125 tons). All the ships carried troops, equipment and ammunition, except for the Kembu Maru, which carried 1,000 drums of avgas and 650 drums of other fuel. The convoy, moving at , was not detected for some time, because of two tropical storms that struck the Solomon and Bismarck Seas between 27 February and 1 March, but at about 15:00 on 1 March, the crew of a patrolling B-24 Liberator heavy bomber spotted the convoy. Eight B-17 Flying Fortresses were sent to the location but failed to locate the ships. At dawn on 2 March, a force of six RAAF A-20 Bostons attacked Lae to reduce its ability to provide support. At about 10:00, another Liberator found the convoy. Eight B-17s took off to attack the ships, followed an hour later by another 20. They found the convoy and attacked with bombs from . They claimed to have sunk up to three merchant ships. Kyokusei Maru had sunk carrying 1,200 army troops, and two other transports, Teiyo Maru and Nojima, were damaged. Eight Japanese fighters were destroyed and 13 damaged in the day's action. The destroyers Yukikaze and Asagumo plucked 950 survivors of Kyokusei Maru from the water. These two destroyers, being faster than the convoy since its speed was dictated by the slower transports, broke away from the group to disembark the survivors at Lae. The destroyers resumed their escort duties the next day. The convoy ‚Äì without the troop transport and two destroyers ‚Äì was attacked again on the evening of 2 March by 11 B-17s, with minor damage to one transport. During the night, PBY Catalina flying boats from No. 11 Squadron RAAF took over the task of shadowing the convoy. =Further attacks= By 3 March, the convoy was within range of the air base at Milne Bay, and eight Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers from No. 100 Squadron RAAF took off from there. Because of bad weather only two found the convoy, and neither scored any hits, but the weather cleared after they rounded the Huon Peninsula. A force of 90 Allied aircraft took off from Port Moresby, and headed for Cape Ward Hunt, while 22 A-20 Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF attacked the Japanese fighter base at Lae, reducing the convoy's air cover. Attacks on the base continued throughout the day. At 10:00, 13 B-17s reached the convoy and bombed from medium altitude of 7,000 feet, causing the ships to maneuver, which dispersed the convoy formation and reduced their concentrated anti-aircraft firepower. The B-17s attracted Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, which were in turn attacked by the P-38 Lightning escorts. A B-17 broke up in the air, and its crew took to their parachutes. Japanese fighter pilots machine-gunned some of the B-17 crew members as they descended and attacked others in the water after they landed. Five of the Japanese fighters strafing the B-17 aircrew were promptly engaged and shot down by three Lightnings, which were also lost. The Allied fighter pilots claimed 15 Zeros destroyed, while the B-17 crews claimed five more. Actual Japanese fighter losses for the day were seven destroyed and three damaged. B-25s arrived shortly afterward and released their 500-pound bombs between 3,000 and 6,000 feet, reportedly causing two Japanese vessels to collide. The result of the B-17 and B-25 sorties scored few hits but left the convoy ships separated making them vulnerable to strafers and masthead bombers, and with the Japanese anti- aircraft fire being focused on the medium-altitude bombers this left an opening for minimum altitude attacks. alt=Pilot in a small cockpit. He is wearing a parachute and leather helmet. This is a still from movie footage shot by Damien Parer. The 13 Beaufighters from No. 30 Squadron RAAF approached the convoy at low level to give the impression they were Beauforts making a torpedo attack.http://www.battleforaustralia.org.au/BABismarkSea.php The ships turned to face them, the standard procedure to present a smaller target to torpedo bombers, allowing the Beaufighters to maximise the damage they inflicted on the ships' anti-aircraft guns, bridges and crews in strafing runs with their four nose cannons and six wing-mounted machine guns. On board one of the Beaufighters was cameraman Damien Parer, who shot dramatic footage of the battle; it was later published in The Bismarck Convoy Smashed. Immediately afterward, seven B-25s of the 38th Bombardment Group's 71st Bombardment Squadron bombed from about , while six from the 405th Bombardment Squadron attacked at mast height. According to the official RAAF release on the Beaufighter attack, \\"enemy crews were slain beside their guns, deck cargo burst into flame, superstructures toppled and burned\\". Garrett Middlebrook, a co-pilot in one of the B-25s, described the ferocity of the strafing attacks: Shirayuki was the first ship to be hit, by a combination of strafing and bombing attacks. Almost all the men on the bridge became casualties, including Kimura, who was wounded. One bomb hit started a magazine explosion that caused the stern to break off, and the ship to sink. Her crew was transferred to Shikinami, and Shirayuki was scuttled. The destroyer Tokitsukaze was also hit and fatally damaged. Its crew was taken off by Yukikaze. The destroyer Arashio was hit, and collided with the transport Nojima, disabling her. Both the destroyer and the transport were abandoned, and Nojima was later sunk by an air attack. alt=Two aircraft fly after a ship at very low altitude Fourteen B-25s returned that afternoon, reportedly claiming 17 hits or near misses. By this time, a third of the transports were sunk or sinking. As the Beaufighters and B-25s had expended their munitions, some USAAF A-20 Havocs of the 3rd Attack Group joined in. Another five hits were claimed by B-17s of the 43rd Bombardment Group from higher altitudes. During the afternoon, further attacks from USAAF B-25s and Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF followed. All seven of the transports were hit and most were burning or sinking about south east of Finschhafen, along with the destroyers Shirayuki, Tokitsukaze and Arashio. Four of the destroyers ‚Äì Shikinami, Yukikaze, Uranami and Asagumo ‚Äì picked up as many survivors as possible and then retired to Rabaul, accompanied by the destroyer , which had come from Rabaul to assist. That night, a force of ten U.S. Navy PT boats ‚Äì under the command of Lieutenant Commander Barry Atkins ‚Äì set out to attack the convoy. Two boats struck submerged debris and were forced to return. The other eight arrived off Lae in the early hours of 4 March. Atkins spotted a fire that turned out to be the transport Oigawa Maru. PT-143 and PT-150 fired torpedoes at it, sinking the crippled vessel. In the morning, a fourth destroyer ‚Äì Asashio ‚Äì was sunk when a B-17 hit her with a bomb while she was picking up survivors from Arashio. Only one destroyer, Yukikaze, was undamaged among the four surviving destroyers. alt=A ship burning from the stern settles in the water. Some 2,700 survivors were taken to Rabaul by the destroyers. On 4 March, another 1,000 or so survivors were adrift on rafts. On the evenings of 3‚Äì5 March, PT boats and planes attacked Japanese rescue vessels, as well as the survivors from the sunken vessels on life rafts and swimming or floating in the sea. This was later justified on the grounds that rescued servicemen would have been rapidly landed at their military destination and promptly returned to active service, as well as being retaliation for the Japanese fighter planes attacking survivors of the downed B-17 bomber. While many of the Allied aircrew accepted these attacks as being necessary, others were sickened. On 6 March, the Japanese submarines and picked up 170 survivors. Two days later, I-26 found another 54 and put them ashore at Lae. Hundreds made their way to various islands. One band of 18 survivors landed on Kiriwina, where they were captured by PT-114. Another made its way to Guadalcanal, only to be killed by an American patrol. On 4 March the Japanese mounted a retaliatory raid on the Buna airfield, the site of a base that the Allies had captured back in January, though the fighters did little damage. Kenney wrote in his memoir that the Japanese reprisal occurred \\"after the horse had been stolen from the barn. It was a good thing that the Nip air commander was stupid. Those hundred airplanes would have made our job awfully hard if they had taken part in the big fight over the convoy on March 3rd.\\" On Goodenough Island, between 8 and 14 March 1943, Australian patrols from the 47th Infantry Battalion found and killed 72 Japanese, captured 42 and found another nine dead on a raft. One patrol killed eight Japanese who had landed in two flat-bottomed boats, in which were found some documents in sealed tins. On translation by the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section, one document turned out to be a copy of the Japanese Army List, with the names and postings of every officer in the Japanese Army. It therefore provided a complete order of battle of the Japanese Army, including many units that had never before been reported. A mention of any Japanese officer could now be correlated with his unit. Copies were made available to intelligence units in every theatre of war against Japan. Aftermath The battle was a disaster for the Japanese. Out of 6,900 troops who were badly needed in New Guinea, only about 1,200 made it to Lae. Another 2,700 were saved by destroyers and submarines and returned to Rabaul. About 2,890 Japanese soldiers and sailors were killed. The Allies lost 13 aircrew, 10 of whom were lost in combat while three others died in an accident. There were also eight wounded. Aircraft losses were one B-17 and three P-38s in combat, and one B-25 and one Beaufighter in accidents. MacArthur issued a communiqu√© on 7 March stating that 22 ships, including twelve transports, three cruisers and seven destroyers, had been sunk along with 12,792 troops. Army Air Force Headquarters in Washington, D.C. looked into the matter in mid-1943 and concluded that there were only 16 ships involved, but GHQ SWPA considered the original account accurate. The victory was a propaganda boon for the Allies, with one United States newsreel claiming the Japanese had lost 22 ships, 15,000 troops, and 102 aircraft.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxu2trrFhHE The Allied Air Forces had used 233,847 rounds of ammunition, and dropped 261 500-pound and 253 thousand-pound bombs. They claimed 19 hits and 42 near misses with the former, and 59 hits and 39 near misses from the latter. Of the 137 bombs dropped in low level attacks, 48, or 35 percent, were claimed to have hit, but only 29, or 7.5 percent, of the 387 bombs dropped from medium altitude. This compared favourably with efforts in August and September 1942 when only 3 percent of bombs dropped were claimed to have scored hits. It was noted that the high and medium altitude attacks scored few hits but dispersed the convoy, while the strafing runs from the Beaufighters had knocked out many of the ships' anti-aircraft defences. Aircraft attacking from multiple directions had confused and overwhelmed the Japanese defences, resulting in lower casualties and more accurate bombing. The results therefore vindicated not just the tactics of mast height attack, but of mounting coordinated attacks from multiple directions. The Japanese estimated that at least 29 bombs had hit a ship during the battle. This was a big improvement over the Battle of Wau back in January, when Allied aircraft attacked a Japanese convoy consisting of five destroyers and five troop transports travelling from Rabaul to Lae, but managed to sink just one transport and beach another. alt=Map of New Guinea showing the coastal routes taken by the Japanese from Wewak and Madang to avoid the Lae area.There was no doubt that the Japanese had suffered a major defeat. Imamura's chief of staff flew to Imperial General Headquarters to report on the disaster. It was decided that there would be no more attempts to land troops at Lae. The losses incurred in the Bismarck Sea caused grave concern for the security of Lae and Rabaul. This resulted in a change of strategy. On 25 March a joint Army-Navy Central Agreement on South West Area Operations gave operations in New Guinea priority over those in the Solomon Islands campaign. The XVIII Army was allocated additional shipping, ordnance and anti-aircraft units, which were sent to Wewak or Hansa Bay. Of the defeat, Rabaul staff officer Masatake Okumiya said, \\"Our losses for this single battle were fantastic. Not during the entire savage fighting at Guadalcanal did we suffer a single comparable blow. We knew we could no longer run cargo ships or even fast destroyer transports to any front on the north coast of New Guinea, east of Wewak.\\" The planned movement of the 20th Division to Madang was revised in the light of events in the Bismarck Sea. The operation was postponed for two days, and the destination was altered from Madang to Hansa Bay further west. To reduce the Allied air threat, the Allied airfield at Wau was bombed on 9 March, and that at Dobodura on 11 March. Three Allied aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and one P-40 was lost in the air, but the Allied fighters claimed to have shot down nine Japanese planes. The transports reached Hansa Bay unscathed on 12 March, and the troops made their way down to Madang on foot or in barges. The 20th Division then became involved in an attempt to construct a road from Madang to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys. It toiled on the road for the next few months, but its efforts were ultimately frustrated by New Guinea's weather and the rugged terrain of the Finisterre Range. Some submarines were made available for supply runs to Lae, but they did not have the capacity to support the troops there by themselves. An operation was carried out on 29 March in which four destroyers successfully delivered 800 troops to Finschhafen, but the growing threat from Allied aircraft led to the development of routes along the coast of New Guinea from Madang to Finschhafen, and along both the north and south coasts of New Britain to Finschhafen, and thence to Lae using Army landing craft. It was by this means that the remainder of the 51st Division finally made the trip to Lae in May. The necessity of delivering troops and supplies to the front in this manner caused immense difficulties for the Japanese in their attempts to halt further Allied advances. After the war, Japanese officers at Rabaul estimated that around 20,000 troops were lost in transit to New Guinea from Rabaul, a significant factor in Japan's ultimate defeat in the New Guinea campaign. In April, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto used the additional air resources allocated to Rabaul in Operation I-Go, an air offensive designed to redress the situation by destroying Allied ships and aircraft in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The operation was indecisive, and Yamamoto himself became a casualty of Allied intelligence and air power in the Solomon Islands on 18 April 1943. Game theory In 1954, O. G. Haywood, Jr., wrote an article in the Journal of the Operations Research Society of America in which game theory was used to model the decision-making in the battle. Since then, the name of the battle has been applied to this particular type of two-person zero-sum game. Notes References          Further reading  External links * Bismarck Convoy Smashed!

The southernmost of its length are within the Navajo Nation. The highway forms part of the Trail of the Ancients, a National Scenic Byway. The highway cuts through the heart of Monument Valley and has been featured in numerous movies and commercials. The highway was designated in 1970, replacing Arizona State Route 464 and Utah State Route 47 as well as a portion of the old alignment of US 160 in Utah. In 1981, US 191 was routed over the northern section of US 163, effectively truncating the northern terminus to Bluff, Utah, from Crescent Junction. The state of Utah briefly had plans for a different routing of US 163 north of Bluff. These plans were rejected, resulting in discrepancies between the signed route and the official designation by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that were not resolved until 2008. The route number does not follow the numbering convention for U.S. Highways, as the number 163 would normally be used for a spur of US 63; however, these two highways have never connected. Route description US 163 near Monument Valley, Utah =Arizona= The southern terminus of US 163 is located at a junction with US 160 south of Kayenta in Navajo County and Navajo Nation. The road continues to the south of this junction as Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Route 591. US 163 heads north from US 160 to the west of the Kayenta Airport as it passes through the town of Kayenta. The highway curves towards the northeast in Kayenta before it curves back towards the north. As it continues towards the north, the highway goes through an s-curve, resulting in a northeasterly heading. US 163 continues this heading as it heads toward Monument Valley and crosses the border into Utah. An stretch of the highway from approximately north of the US 160 junction to the Utah border has been designated as a scenic route by the state of Arizona. =Utah= The highway offers dramatic views. The Utah portion of the highway begins in Monument Valley, in San Juan County. Just after entering Utah the highway junctions with the Monument Valley Visitors center. The highway proceeds northeast until the town of Mexican Hat where the highway both crosses the San Juan River and exits the Navajo Nation. From Mexican Hat, the highway travels due east to towards its signed terminus in Bluff. Formerly, the route continued along what is now signed US 191 to I-70, however the portion north of Bluff was not signed after the creation of US 191 and was formally removed in 2008. The length of US 163 in Utah has been designated the Bluff to Monument Valley Scenic byway by the Utah State Legislature and forms part of the Trail of the Ancients National Scenic Byway. All highways in Utah are codified in law; US 163 is defined at Utah Code ¬ß72-4-122(3). History US 163 seen towards northeast. The modern routing of US 163 in Utah was initially designated as State Route 47, in 1910. SR 47 extended to Monticello at a junction with then U.S. Route 160. In Arizona, the road appeared on maps as early as 1935, but it was still an unimproved dirt road at the time. The Arizona portion was added to the state highway system in 1960 when it was designated as State Route 464. In 1970, US 163 was designated along SR 464 in Arizona and SR 47 in Utah as part of a re-alignment of U.S. highways in the Four Corners region. With the re-alignment, US 160 was re-routed into Arizona instead of Utah. US 163 also absorbed the former route of US 160 to its former terminus at Interstate 70 at Crescent Junction. In 1981, AASHTO approved a new iteration of U.S. Route 191 that absorbed much of the alignment of US 163. Utah truncated US 163 at Bluff. The truncation was made without approval from AASHTO, as the AASHTO logs placed the northern terminus of US 163 at I-70 at Crescent Junction. View of Monument Valley in Utah, looking south on US 163 The state of Utah signed a joint intent with the Navajo Nation and San Juan County in 1986 to construct a new highway to connect Bluff with Montezuma Creek. Businesses in Monument Valley asked the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) to request extensions of US 163 and US 666 using this new road. The proposal would have US 163 run from Cedar City to US 160 near Cortez, Colorado along the routes of State Route 14, U.S. Route 89, Arizona State Route 98, U.S. Route 160, the current US 163, the new road from Bluff to Montezuma Creek, and Colorado State Highway 41. The proposal for US 666 would extend to Richfield via upgrades to State Route 95 and State Route 24. UDOT submitted the proposal for US 666 to AASHTO, which was rejected. AASHTO cited that the route was not direct, and SR-24 was not built to U.S. Highway standards. UDOT did not pursue the extension of US 163, even though the Utah state legislature had already approved the new road from Bluff to Montezuma creek as route 163. With this extension the Utah definition of US 163 conflicted with the AASHTO definition. UDOT resolved this discrepancy by signing the extended portion as State Route 163. In 2004, the plan to extend US 163 was abandoned, and the extension was renumbered SR-162 to \\"make the state route numbers run synonymous with the U.S. route designation.\\" Although the state changed the definition of US 163 back to match the national definition in 2004, the portion north of Bluff remained unsigned. In October 2008, UDOT requested and obtained approval to truncate US 163 to the junction with US 191 resolving the discrepancy.

The name is pronounced \\"tar-bish\\", despite the spelling.The Centre of the world at the edge of a continent, Carol Corbin,Judith A. Rolls, pg. 58, UCCB Press 1996 It is played primarily by the people of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, in Canada, where it was brought in 1901 by a Lebanese immigrant George Shebib.The Nova Scotia genealogist, pg. 18 - Genealogical Association of Nova Scotia, Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society - 1994 Object The game is over when one or both teams accumulate 500 points or more. Points are counted at the end of each hand and both teams always count their points. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins. =The deck= A Tarabish deck consists of a normal deck of playing cards with the 2 through 5 of each suit removed. In preparation for the hand the dealer shuffles the cards in the usual manner. When finished the person to the right of the dealer cuts the cards. The cut must leave at least four cards in each portion of the deck. Once the cards have been cut, no further shuffling is allowed. The 36 Tarabish cards are dealt in groups of three beginning to the left of the dealer and proceeding clockwise until all the cards are passed out. The four players look at their first six cards; the last three, called the kitty, remain face down until after the bid is complete and a trump suit has been chosen. =Cards value= The cards have a strict point value in trumps: ::*J = 20 points ::*9 = 14 points ::*A = 11 points ::*10 = 10 points ::*K = 4 point ::*Q = 3 point ::*8 7 6 = no value The order and value in a non-trump suit are: ::*A = 11 points ::*10 = 10 points ::*K = 4 points ::*Q = 3 points ::*J = 2 points ::*9 8 7 6 = no value =The bid= The bid is the process of determining the trump suit for the hand. The player to the left of the dealer has the first option of choosing the trump suit. If they pass the decision passes to the next person and so on. In the most popular variation, if the bid passes to the dealer, the dealer is forced to choose a trump suit. The less popular variation allows the dealer to pass in which case the hand is complete and the deal passes to the next player. The team that goes must accumulate more than half of the points for that hand. If they get less than half, it is termed a bait and their points go to their opponents. If they get exactly half the points it is termed half-bait in which case they count zero while their opponents of course get to count their own. =The play= Play begins with the player to the left of the dealer and proceeds clockwise until each player has played a card. Each player must follow suit by playing a card of the same suit as the first card of each trick. If you don't have a card of the same suit you must play a trump if you have one. If you don't have a trump you can play anything. Any time you play a trump you must beat any other trumps on the trick if you can. The person with the highest card on the trick collects the cards and makes the first play for the next trick. When you collect tricks it is important to keep them neat as they may need to be referred to in the event of a mis-play. Completed tricks must be kept face down. You may suspend play at any time and ask to see the last completed trick but none before it. Once a trick is turned over it is considered complete. =Misplay= Failure to comply with the rules outlined in the preceding sections is called a ‚Äò‚Äômis-play‚Äô‚Äô. If you suspect someone has mis-played you can stop the hand and ‚Äò‚Äôcall a mis-play‚Äô‚Äô. You must then prove it by examining the over-turned tricks and identifying the trick where the mis-play occurred. As an example, consider a trick where the King of trump is lead and the second player places a 6 of trump on the trick. If later the second player plays the 9 of trump, a good tarabish player will remember that the second player didn't beat the King on the opening trick. If you are successful in proving the mis-play your team gets all of the points for the hand that have been played . However, if you cannot pick out the mis-play, your opponents get all the points. At any time a player may throw his cards and forfeit the points that have been played. =Scoring= Upon completion of each hand, teams count the points in their winning tricks to determine the scores. Base score for a hand is 162 points, before any runs or \\"Bella\\" is counted. This is derived from 62 points in trump values, 90 points in non trump values, and 10 points for taking the last trick. The calling team must be able to score at least one more than half the points available (82 by default), otherwise all points are awarded to the opposition. This is known as \\"going bait\\". The highest possible score for a team in 1 hand is 282 (2 \\"50's\\" and Bella) since only the highest straight is counted, but a single player can have more than 1 straight if their hand contains the highest straight among players. =Runs= There are two types of runs. Runs in tarabish are according to the customary card rank as in Poker (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A). So the three best trumps (J, 9, A) do not make a run. *A twenty is a run of three cards in a row of the same suit. (e.g. 6, 7, 8 of hearts or 9, 10, J of clubs) *A fifty is a run similar to a twenty however it is a run of four cards in a row. If you happen to have 5 or 6 cards in a row it is still just a fifty and the extra cards are in no way significant when comparing to other runs. *A player with a run must announce to the other players that they have a run before they play their first card. A player must show their run immediately before playing their second card. One player can have multiple runs, but only one player can count runs in a hand. If more than one player announces a run, the player with the \\"best\\" run according to the following will get to count all of their runs. If a player has multiple runs, their best run is used for the following comparison: * A fifty always beats a twenty. * When comparing two runs of the same size, the one with the highest rank is best. * A run in trumps beats a run of the same size and rank in non-trumps. * Two runs of the same size and rank in non-trumps cancel each other out. In this case no one counts their runs even if one player has multiple runs. If a player announces a run, but fails to show it before the play of their second card, the run is not counted. A popular version suggests that if a player called a fifty but forgets to show it, before the third card is played, a twenty can be shown and counted, but only other players. =Bella= Bella (or Bells) is when a player has a king and queen of the trump suit in the same hand and is worth an additional 20 points when called. The player MUST call bella when playing the last of the 2 cards to get the points. Common practice allows to instead call the first of the bells rather than the last. This is advantageous in remembering to call it, but gives others information about one's hand and may be detrimental in giving away points if going bate. * Official rules state that calling \\"first of bells\\" is table-talk and an automatic forfeiture of points since it is telling your partner of another guaranteed trump you have in your hand. In the event that bella is part of a valid run, the player has the option to announce \\"Bella\\" when they show their run or wait until played. Tarabish terms *Bait - The team which \\"calls\\" trump and fails to accumulate at least one point more than half the points available. *Half Bait - The team which \\"calls\\" trump accumulates exactly half the available points. The calling team receives a score of zero, the non-calling team receives full credit for their score (1/2 of the total score of the hand). *Bella - When a player has the King and Queen of trump in a single hand. *Run - Three or four cards in sequence in the same suit. *Twenty - A run of three cards. *Fifty - A run of four cards. *Misplay or renege - When a player doesn't follow the lead suit, or doesn't beat trump when he can. If a misplay is called against a team, all the points go to the team who called the misplay. *Last - Final trick earning an additional 10 points to the winning team. *Kitty - The three cards that are hidden to a player until after a trump is called. *Playing to beat - If at any time a player is forced to play a trump, he must beat the best trump card on the table. *Linganer - A 3-card run consisting of 6-7-8, named after the former 876 Lingan Coal Mine. *Johnny and the Nerf - The Jack and 9 of trump, respectably. *50 with the bells - Calling and showing a 3 or 4-card run that includes the king and queen of trump (bella). In more informal circumstances, can be called 50 with the nuts and sluts. *Dry Ten - When a player has only the 10 in a suit, after being dealt their cards *Forced - A popular variation. If a team has over 400 points, that team is forced to call trump. Therefore, they are not allowed to pass trump call to the dealer if the dealer is on the opposite team. If both teams are over 400 points, the team with the higher points is 'forced'.

It rises in the Berkshire Downs near its namesake village of Lambourn and is a tributary of the River Kennet, which is itself a tributary of the River Thames. The river is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest and Special Protection Area under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds. Perennial River The upper reaches of the river are seasonal, with a perennial source derived from a number of springs located upstream of the village of Great Shefford. At times when the water table in the chalk aquifer feeding the river is high (usually between November and March) the source of the river migrates upstream. Along the bourn section of the river are located the villages of Eastbury and East Garston, while along the perennial section of the river are the villages of Great Shefford, Welford, Boxford, Bagnor, Donnington and Shaw. Below Shaw is the confluence of the River Lambourn with the River Kennet, located between Newbury and Thatcham. The River Lambourn itself has a single perennial tributary, the Winterbourne Stream, which joins it at the village of Bagnor. River Lambourn between road and pavement, Upper Lambourn, Berkshire River Lambourn leaving Lambourn Lambourn Valley Way The Lambourn Valley Way from the Uffington White Horse to Newbury generally follows the River Lambourn from Lambourn to Donnington Castle, in many places using the embankments of the old Lambourn Valley Railway. Upper Lambourn and Lynch Wood The highest source of the Lambourn is on the Maddle Road in the village of Upper Lambourn, near the Wiltshire and Oxfordshire borders. It emerges from a rainwater drain and occasionally flows down a channel between the road and pavement. In the village it runs underground in a pipe until re-emerging alongside the road opposite The Malt Shovel and along Malt Shovel Lane. At this point it is usually little more than a damp, muddy ditch, and remains so until halfway through Lynch Wood. Here it is fed by several springs, two of which are close to the Goose Green road, forming a short stream that runs ten feet downhill into the river. These springs quickly fill the channel and the river swells ten to twenty feet wide and over three feet deep, submerging several fallen trees. Although bourne until Great Shefford the river was not dry below Lynch Wood in 2007‚Äì08. However, it dried up in June‚ÄìJuly 2009 and the riverbed remained dry until January 2010 due to 4-5 inches of snow melting in a thaw. It dried up again from the summer of 2010 until the spring of 2012, when increased rainfall filled the river, since when the adjacent roads in Upper Lambourn, Lambourn and Eastbury have been regularly flooded. Lambourn to Thatcham The river leaves the wood and enters Lambourn under a bridge crossed by the Goose Green Road, here it flows more quickly as the channel narrows to four to six feet across and six to eight inches deep. It is constricted by the houses built on the riverbank, which were partially flooded in July 2007 as numerous weeds clogged the river under the many small bridges (and even one garden shed) built over it. It passes by The Lamb and the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service and runs between the houses on the south side of the Newbury Road and the playing fields to the north of Bockhampton Road. There is a ford next to the Bockhampton Road bridge which is used by horses (and accidentally by a car in March 2009, which had to be pulled out) and the river leaves the town through Bockhampton Manor Farm. Bernard's Ford is found to the west of Eastbury, which is also suitable only for tractors and horses. Here the Lambourn forced its banks in July 2007 and flowed down the Newbury Road for over a hundred yards before rejoining the river. The Lambourn runs through the middle of Eastbury, and past The Plough Inn, which holds The Great Eastbury Duck Race on the river in May. In East Garston there are many houses are built on one bank with their own bridges from the front door to the road opposite. The river splits into several channels at Great Shefford, and is joined by many small streams, which join as it leaves the village under the A338 Swan Bridge and behind The Swan. From Lambourn to Newbury the river remains roughly parallel to the Newbury Road (which becomes the Lambourn Road) which crosses it many times. In Newbury it runs between Donnington and Speen and south of Shaw House until it joins the River Kennet to the south of The Nature Discovery Centre. The River Kennet joins the River Thames at Reading. Flow regime The River Lambourn is almost unique for a chalk stream in southern England in that its flow regime remains near-natural in form; not being significantly modified by groundwater abstraction. Ironically, this situation developed because of a major groundwater abstraction project. In the 1960s the long term water supply situation for London was regarded as vulnerable and one avenue investigated to rectify this was to use untapped water resources naturally stored in the chalk aquifer of low population density areas of south east England. One such area was the West Berkshire Downs, including the catchment of the River Lambourn. The plan was to abstract groundwater from the chalk aquifer during times of drought and then use the existing river system as a natural conduit to transport the water to London, via the River Kennet and the River Thames.pp81-82, Elizabeth Porter, Water Management in England and Wales, Cambridge University Press, 1979 An area in the catchment of the River Lambourn was selected as a pilot study to assess the feasibility of the project, and the Lambourn Valley Pilot Scheme was undertaken between 1967 and 1970. The final conclusion from the pilot study was that the overall scheme appeared feasible and a significant number of large abstraction boreholes and observation boreholes, together with pipelines and control equipment, were installed in the Lambourn catchment and also in other nearby river catchments. The project, named the Thames Groundwater Scheme, was completed in 1976 to coincide with the most serious drought in 50 years, but on final testing of the scheme it was found that the effective increase in river flow downstream was minimal, and essentially the project was a failure. Almost all of the infrastructure for the project (now known as the West Berkshire Groundwater Scheme) is still in place and maintained, albeit on a rather shoestring budget. But the lasting legacy of the scheme is that the catchment has been preserved as a near-natural groundwater system, almost totally unaffected by groundwater abstractions. This factor made it an ideal candidate for selection as one of the flagship research sites for the NERC LOCAR research project investigating permeable (i.e. groundwater dominated) catchments. The Second Battle of Newbury, 1644 In 1644 the Royalist Army of King Charles I of England took up a defensive position in the triangle where the River Lambourn meets the River Kennet, with fortifications at Shaw House and Speen. Here it was attacked by the Parliamentarian Armies in the Second battle of Newbury on 27 October 1644.

Route description U.S. Route 264 begins at the Raleigh Beltline (which carries US 64 and Interstate 440 or I-440) and travels to the east from a directional T interchange, concurrently with both I-87 and US 64 along with it on a freeway alignment. It meets the eastern terminus of I-540, which features several unused stub ramps. The I-87 concurrency ends at the Rolesville Road interchange in Wendell. The route curves to the northeast, paralleling North Carolina Highway 97 (NC 97), until it passes by Zebulon. At the north side of town, US 64 continues to the northeast, while the US 264 freeway continues east through a long wooded stretch. It curves to the south just before it meets I-95/I-795, just west of Wilson. As the freeway loops south of Wilson, the short concurrency of I-795 splits-off towards Goldsboro as US 264 continues east to Greenville. In Greenville, the freeway downgrades to expressway grade at the US 13/NC 11/NC 903 interchange. After completing the loop north around Greenville, it continues east, on Pactolus Highway, through a largely undeveloped area and passes through Washington and US 17. The route continues east on a two-lane road, cutting through mostly farmland. It begins to curve to the northeast after meeting NC 99, entering Pantego on Main Street. Within the town, it curves to the east again and then south toward Belhaven, where it bypasses north of town while US 264 Business goes through it. After Belhaven, US 264 continues eastward once again entering Hyde county, passing south of Lake Mattamuskeet through an area dominated by farmland and through the community of Engelhard. Turning north, US 264 goes through the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge before finally reaching Manns Harbor, where US 264 ends at intersection with US 64\\\\. =Scenic byways= Pamlico Scenic Byway is an byway from Washington to Manns Harbor. US 264 overlap several sections of the byway. The byway is noted for its history, scenic views, and the three national wildlife refuges that the route goes through. Other roads and highways that make-up the byway are: NC 32, NC 45, NC 92, and NC 94. History NC 121/Farmville I-495 and US 264, in Raleigh Established in 1932, US 264 started from US 64/NC 90, in Zebulon, to the community of Engelhard, in Hyde County. The route was overlapped entirely with NC 91 and was paved west of Swan Quarter. In 1934, NC 91 was removed along the route; in 1935, US 264 was paved from Swan Quarter to Engelhard. Sometime between 1948-'50, US 264 was moved south around Wilson, on Ward Boulevard; the old route became US 264 Alternate, which later became US 264 Business in 1960 till 1980-'84. Sometime between 1951-'52, US 264 was extended east from Engelhard to Manns Harbor, where it connected back with US 64\\\\. It continued east, overlapped with US 64, ending at Whalebone Junction with US 158 and NC 12. Sometime between 1953-'54, US 264 was bypassed Farmville and Greenville; the old routes became US 264 Alternate, eventually both were decommissioned by 1990. By 1958, US 264 was moved north around Swan Quarter, replaced by NC 45 and NC 94\\\\. In 1962-'63, US 264 was bypassed north around Belhaven, old route through town becoming US 264 Business. Between 1972-'78, US 264 was moved onto a Super-2 routing north of Sims, Bailey, and Middlesex. Much of the old route become US 264 Business, which is today part of US 264 Alternate. In 1979, the Super-2 was upgraded to freeway standards. Between 1987-'90, US 264 was moved onto new freeway south of Wilson; the old route along Ward Boulevard became part of the current US 264 Alternate route. Also during this time, US 264 was upgraded to freeway standards east of Farmville to Greenville. Between 1991-'93, US 264 was moved north onto new freeway, bypassing Farmville. Sometime between 1994 and 1999, US 264 was extended west from Zebulon, to the junction with I-440 in Raleigh. This would later change on July 8, 2005, when the Knightdale Bypass was completed. In August 2002, US 264 was truncated east at Manns Harbor. In 2004, US 264 was rerouted, between I-95 and NC 121, onto new freeway, south of Wilson. In 2007, part of this route was overlapped with I-795. In 2016, construction began on a bypass between U.S. 264 in Greenville, where it connects with the city's Stantonsburg Road, to North Carolina Highway 11 as it passes through Ayden. Future Interstate 587 In January, 2013, the mayors of Greenville, Kinston, and Ayden announced that they would push to change the designation of US 264 between Wilson and Greenville to an interstate. On September 7, 2016, Gov. Pat McCrory said he would ask for the section of US 264 between Zebulon and Greenville to be designated an interstate highway. Justification for interstate was that Greenville was the tenth largest city in the state and had no interstate connecting it. On November 14, AASHTO approved the Future I-587 designation; followed by FHWA approval on November 21. In April 2017, NCDOT began posting Future I-587 signs along the length of the route. Junction list Special routes =Middlesex-Greenville alternate route= Established around 1984, US 264 Alternate was a renumbering of the Middlesex business loop, which followed the original alignment of US 264 from Middlesex to Wilson. In 2004, it was extended east to Greenville, absorbing US 264 alternate between Farmville and Greenville. =Middlesex business loop= Established by 1978, it was a renumbering of mainline US 264, which was moved onto new routing north of Bailey, Middlesex, and Sims. Originally, US 264 business ran from NC 581 to near Interstate 95; it was extended west to NC 39 in 1979. In 1984, the entire route was redesignated to US 264 Alternate. =Wilson alternate route= Established around 1950, it was a renumbering of mainline US 264 through downtown Wilson, via Raleigh Road and Nash Street. It was renumbered in 1960 to US 264 Business. =Wilson business loop= Established in 1960 as renumbering of US 264 Alternate, it remained unchanged till 1984, when it was decommissioned. =Farmville alternate route= Established around 1954 as a renumbering of mainline US 264, it traversed through downtown Farmville, via Wilson Street and Moye-Turnage Road. It was decommissioned by 1990 when US 264 bypassed north of Farmville and its former alignment south of Farmville became its alternate route. NC 121 replaced the eastern half of the former route from US 264 Alt to Main Street. =Wilson‚ÄìGreenville alternate route= Established around 1990 as a renumbering of mainline US 264; which traversed from Farmville to Greenville. In 2002, it was extended west of Farmville to Wilson, replacing part of NC 121 and NC 91. In 2004, it was absorbed by the Middlesex- Greenville alternate route. =Greenville alternate route= Established by 1954 as a renumbering of mainline US 264, it traversed through downtown Greenville via Dickenson Avenue and East 10th Street. In 1960, it was renumbered as US 264 Business. The route of the Greenville and Raleigh Plank Road, which was established in 1853, became part of the route of US 264 between Greenville and Wilson, North Carolina. Although no longer maintained after the company went bankrupt in 1861, the route was still used as an unpaved track and Right of way by horse and motor traffic. State senator James Leonidas Fleming, who established East Carolina University in Greenville, was killed in an early automobile accident along the plank road in 1909.King, Thomas Henry. 1911. Sketches of Pitt County.

In 1960, it was renumbered as US 264 Business. =Belhaven business loop= U.S. Route 64 Business (US 64 Bus) was established in 1960, the route follows the original US 264 alignment through downtown Belhaven, via Main Street and Pamlico Street. =Manns Harbor‚ÄìManteo Bypass= U.S. Route 264 Bypass (US 264 By-pass) was established in 1999 as a new primary routing bypassing Manns Harbor and Manteo, while also providing direct access between Nags Head and the mainland. Its main feature is the Virginia Dare Memorial Bridge, which is a divided four-lane bridge crossing over the Croatan Sound. Sharing a complete concurrency with US 64 Bypass throughout its existence, it was removed in 2003 when US 264's eastern terminus was relocated further west.

In the book, published in 2003, Truss bemoans the state of punctuation in the United Kingdom and the United States and describes how rules are being relaxed in today's society. Her goal is to remind readers of the importance of punctuation in the English language by mixing humour and instruction. Truss dedicates the book \\"to the memory of the striking Bolshevik printers of St. Petersburg who, in 1905, demanded to be paid the same rate for punctuation marks as for letters, and thereby directly precipitated the first Russian Revolution\\"; she added this dedication as an afterthought after finding the factoid in a speech from a librarian. Eats, Shoots and Leaves Google Books result  Overview  There is one chapter each on apostrophes; commas; semicolons and colons; exclamation marks, question marks and quotation marks; italic type, dashes, brackets, ellipses and emoticons; and the last one on hyphens. Truss touches on varied aspects of the history of punctuation and includes many anecdotes, which add another dimension to her explanations of grammar. In the book's final chapter, she opines on the importance of maintaining punctuation rules and addresses the damaging effects of email and the Internet on punctuation. Irish American author Frank McCourt, author of Angela's Ashes, wrote the foreword to the US edition of Eats, Shoots & Leaves. In keeping with the general lighthearted tone of the book, he praises Truss for bringing life back into the art of punctuation, adding, \\"If Lynne Truss were Roman Catholic I'd nominate her for sainthood.\\" The book was a commercial success. In 2004, the US edition became a New York Times best-seller. Contrary to usual publishing practice, the US edition of the book left the original British conventions intact. Title The title of the book is a syntactic ambiguitya verbal fallacy arising from an ambiguous or erroneous grammatical constructionand derived from a joke (a variant on a \\"bar joke\\") about bad punctuation, here from the back cover of the book: The joke turns on the ambiguity of the final sentence fragment. As intended by the author, \\"eats\\" is a verb, while \\"shoots\\" and \\"leaves\\" are the verb's objects: a panda's diet comprises shoots and leaves. However, the erroneous introduction of the comma gives the mistaken impression that the sentence fragment comprises three verbs listing in sequence the panda's characteristic conduct: it eats, then it shoots, and finally it leaves.  Reception  In a 2004 review, Louis Menand of The New Yorker pointed out several dozen punctuation errors in the book, including one in the dedication, and wrote that \\"an Englishwoman lecturing Americans on semicolons is a little like an American lecturing the French on sauces. Some of Truss's departures from punctuation norms are just British laxness.\\"Bad Comma: Lynne Truss's strange grammar by Louis Menand, The New Yorker, 28 June 2004. In The Fight for English: How Language Pundits Ate, Shot and Left (Oxford University Press 2006), linguist David Crystal analyses the linguistic purism of Truss and other writers through the ages.\\"Author takes on the queen of commas\\", David Smith, The Observer, Sunday 3 September 2006. In 2006, English lecturer Nicholas Waters released Eats, Roots & Leaves, criticising the \\"grammar fascists\\" who \\"want to stop the language moving into the 21st century.\\"War of Words, Bournemouth Echo, 27 July 2007 This view was shared by dyslexic English comedian and satirist Marcus Brigstocke in a 2007 episode of Room 101, in which he blames Truss's book for starting off a trend in which people have become \\"grammar bullies\\". In her 2005 book, Talk to the Hand, Truss acknowledges some of the criticism, obliquely admitting that much of it is warranted.

CPC-Ontario leader In 1992, a majority of delegates at the Communist Party's national convention voted to abandon Marxism-Leninism and pursue a social democratic alternative. Rankin was a part of the minority group led by Miguel Figueroa that opposed the change, and continued to support traditional communist principles. The party split, and the minority group won the rights to the Communist Party name through an out-of-court settlement. Rankin was appointed as interim leader of the Communist Party of Canada - Ontario in April 1995, and led the party in the 1995 provincial election. The national party had fallen to only 500 members in this period, and the Ontario party ran a low-profile campaign with only five candidates and an $8,000 budget.John Gray, \\"Liberal numbers don't add up in attack on NDP expenditure\\", Globe and Mail, 16 May 1995, A6.

It goes through the cities of Little Rock, Arkansas, Alexandria, Louisiana, and Lafayette, Louisiana. Some of the highway's route has been combined with or parallels Interstate 49 in Louisiana. Between Junction City, AR and Ruston, LA, U.S. 167 runs concurrent with U.S. 63. Route description =Louisiana= U.S. Highway 167 in Louisiana runs in a north‚Äìsouth direction from the national southern terminus at Louisiana Highway 14 Business (LA 14 Bus.) in Abbeville to the Arkansas state line at Junction City. The route cuts through the center of Louisiana for roughly its entire length and passes through two of the state's metropolitan areas, Lafayette and Alexandria. Between those cities, US 167 ranges in character from an urban freeway to a lightly traveled two-lane collector. During this stretch, it overlaps the southern of Interstate 49 (I-49) from Lafayette through Opelousas before making a diversion through rural Evangeline Parish to serve the small city of Ville Platte. US 167 follows a combination of I-49 and the Pineville Expressway through Alexandria and Pineville, crossing the Red River via the twin-span Purple Heart Memorial Bridge. US 167 remains a surface four-lane highway through northern Louisiana and is the primary north‚Äìsouth route through Winnfield, Jonesboro, and Ruston. The northern portion of the route, beginning at the I-20 interchange in Ruston, also carries the first of US 63\\\\. On its southern end, US 167 began near Colfax, Louisiana when designated as one of the original numbered U.S. Highways in 1926. However, the route was extended to Abbeville in 1949 over a number of existing state highways, more than doubling its length within Louisiana. Since that time, US 167 has experienced several alignment shifts as freeways were constructed in its two urban areas. More recently, all but approximately of the route was widened to four lanes as part of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) TIMED program. Abbeville to Lafayette From the south, US 167 begins at an intersection with LA 14 Bus. (Port Street) in the Vermilion Parish city of Abbeville, located in southern Louisiana. The route heads north on Park Avenue, an undivided four-lane thoroughfare, and crosses mainline LA 14 (West Summers Drive). US 167 travels due north from Abbeville and becomes a divided four-lane highway on a wide right-of-way upon entering rural surroundings. The highway will repeat this pattern throughout the majority of its distance in Louisiana. Passing through Maurice, US 167 has a brief concurrency with LA 92\\\\. The highway then curves to the northeast and crosses into Lafayette Parish. US 167 enters the suburban outgrowth of Lafayette and crosses the city limits just beyond a junction with LA 733 (East Broussard Road). The highway, locally known as Johnston Street, becomes a busy commercial corridor near the Acadiana Mall and intersects several major thoroughfares on the southwest side of town, including LA 3073 (Ambassador Caffery Parkway) and LA 3025 (College Road). Nearing the downtown area, US 167 passes the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, located at a junction with US 90 Bus./LA 182 (University Avenue). The route turns northwest onto the Evangeline Thruway, a one-way pair, and overlaps US 90 for about ten blocks. This short stretch represents the only non-freeway six-lane portion of US 167 in Louisiana. On the north side of town, the highway passes through a cloverleaf interchange with I-10 at exit 103, connecting with Baton Rouge to the east and Lake Charles to the west. This interchange also marks the southern terminus of I-49. I-49 concurrency and rural two-lane US 167 utilizes the alignment of I-49 for the next . The freeway initially carries six lanes of traffic but quickly narrows to four through lanes. The highway crosses from Lafayette into Carencro at exit 2, which connects to LA 98 (Gloria Switch Road). Carencro proper is served by exit 4, connecting with LA 726\\\\. North of Carencro, I-49/US 167 intersects the parallel LA 182 before crossing into St. Landry Parish. In St. Landry Parish, the freeway cuts through the adjacent communities of Sunset and Grand Coteau, served by exit 11 to LA 93\\\\. Further north, the route skirts the eastern edge of the city of Opelousas, which is accessed by exit 18 to LA 31 (Creswell Lane) and exit 19 to US 190\\\\. US 167 departs from the alignment of I-49 at the next exit and heads west through a point known as Nuba and a junction with LA 10 and LA 182. Narrowing to an undivided two-lane highway, US 167 travels northwest, overlapping LA 10 into Evangeline Parish. Here, the highway enters the city of Ville Platte and diverges onto the one-way pair of LaSalle and Main Streets through the center of town. During this stretch, US 167 intersects and briefly overlaps LA 29\\\\. After narrowing to two lanes again, US 167 turns due north at the western edge of Ville Platte and separates from LA 10\\\\. The highway passes to the east of Millers Lake and through an area known as Bayou Chicot, where it intersects LA 106\\\\. A few miles later, US 167 reaches a T-intersection with LA 13 in Turkey Creek. US 167 turns north to continue the path of LA 13 and travels several miles through a very sparsely populated area. Alexandria metropolitan area US 167 crosses into Rapides Parish just north of Clearwater and crosses under I-49 at exit 61. Soon afterward, it reaches a T-intersection with US 71 near Meeker and departs from the last stretch of two-lane pavement along its route. US 167 turns northwest and follows the alignment of US 71 alongside the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) line for the next through Lecompte, Lamourie, and Chambers. In Chambers, the highway passes the Louisiana State University at Alexandria, located about south of the Alexandria city limits. Upon entering Alexandria, the principal city of central Louisiana, US 71 and US 167 engage into an interchange with I-49 at exit 80. (This interchange is also exit 63 on US 71.) US 167 takes the entrance ramp to begin another concurrency with I-49, while US 71 proceeds straight ahead onto MacArthur Drive co-signed as US 167 Bus.. This time, the freeway begins with four through lanes and widens to six lanes further into town. On the edge of the business district, US 167 departs from I-49 a final time via exit 84 and transitions onto the Pineville Expressway joined with LA 28\\\\. As the highway elevates to begin the approach onto the Red River bridge, ramps connect to LA 1 and LA 28 Bus. via the grade-level one-way pair of Casson and Fulton Streets. This interchange also reconnects US 167 Bus. to the parent route, though it is not signed here. US 167 proceeds over the six-lane twin-span Purple Heart Memorial Bridge and crosses from Alexandria into the smaller adjacent city of Pineville. US 167 is predominantly a grade-level four-lane freeway through the Pineville area with exits that do not utilize a numbering scheme. Tight diamond interchanges connect with LA 1250 (Shamrock Street) to Downtown Pineville and LA 107 toward Marksville. LA 28 departs to the east toward Jonesville at the next exit. US 167 curves northwest on the Pineville Expressway through Kingsville and intersects US 165, the main route connecting Alexandria with Monroe. Shortly afterward, in the community of Tioga, US 167 joins US 71 again briefly until the latter splits off toward Shreveport. Just before crossing into Grant Parish, the freeway ends as US 167 intersects LA 3225 at Creola. North Louisiana US 167 enters the Kisatchie National Forest at Prospect and remains within its boundaries throughout Grant Parish and into Winn Parish. Notable junctions along this stretch include LA 8 at Bentley, LA 123 in Dry Prong, and LA 500 at Packton. About north of Packton, US 167 curves due west onto East Lafayette Street in the city of Winnfield. The route overlaps US 84 and LA 34 through the center of town, where it crosses over the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) line and transitions onto West Court Street. With the other highways departing to the south and west, US 167 resumes its northerly course out of Winnfield, passing through Dodson and into Jackson Parish. US 167 follows the KCS Railway into the town of Jonesboro, where it travels along Old Winnsboro Road. After beginning a concurrency with LA 147, US 167 intersects LA 4 (East Main Street) in the center of town. Just north of Jonesboro, US 167 passes through the adjacent communities of Hodge and North Hodge, where LA 147 turns off to the northwest. US 167 winds its way through Quitman, Ansley, and Clay before crossing into Lincoln Parish. In Lincoln Parish, US 167 proceeds north into the city of Ruston and diverges onto the one-way pair of Vienna and Trenton Streets. The route overlaps US 80 for nine blocks and also begins a longer concurrency with LA 146 at California Avenue. Heading out of the business district, US 167 passes through an interchange with I-20, connecting with Shreveport to the west and Monroe to the east. This interchange also marks the southern terminus of US 63, and the two highways will remain paired throughout the remainder of their distance in Louisiana. North of Ruston, the rural surroundings return once again. While passing through Vienna, LA 146 departs to the west. US 167 proceeds through Unionville and Dubach before crossing into Union Parish. In Union Parish, the highway enters Bernice, where it follows another one-way pair (Cherry and Plum Streets). In this small town, LA 2 Alt. utilizes the alignment of US 167 to reconnect to its parent route, LA 2\\\\. In Lillie, US 167 intersects the northern terminus of LA 15 just west of Spearsville. The route then curves northwest toward Junction City, located on the Arkansas state line. US 167 follows Main Street through town and intersects LA 9 (West Fifth Street). At 3rd Street, the highway crosses the state line into Junction City, Arkansas and proceeds northward co-signed with US 63 toward El Dorado. Route classification and data US 167 has several different functional classifications over the course of its route, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). The route is classified as an urban principal arterial through most of the cities it serves. Outside of town, the majority of the route serves as a rural minor arterial south of Alexandria and as a rural principal arterial northward. Two notable exceptions are the portions running concurrent with I-49, which are classified as urban and rural interstates, and the portion between Ville Platte and Turkey Creek, which is a rural major collector. Daily traffic volume in 2013 peaked at 53,500 vehicles in Lafayette and 56,100 in Alexandria, both along concurrencies with I-49. The lowest count reported was 1,110 vehicles north of Turkey Creek. Several pieces of the southern half of US 167 are included in the state-designated system of tourist routes known as the Louisiana Scenic Byways. The portion between Abbeville and Lafayette is part of the Jean Lafitte Scenic Byway, and much of the route through Evangeline Parish is part of the Zydeco Cajun Prairie Scenic Byway. =Arkansas= US 167 in Sheridan Highway 167 enters Arkansas at Junction City, a twin city with Junction City, Louisiana. Entering the state, Highway 167 is paired with U.S. Highway 63. The highways runs northeast through rural Union County to a junction with Highway 7 near the historic Joel Smith House. The three highways begin a concurrency intersect U.S. Highway 82 shortly after entering El Dorado. North of this junction is a grade-separated intersection with U.S. Highway 82B and U.S. Highway 167B, leading into downtown El Dorado and the El Dorado Commercial Historic District. The next intersection is with Main Street and is also grade-separated. Highway 63 breaks from the aforementioned concurrency to the east toward Warren. Following an interchange with Champagnolle Road, Highway 167 ends its overlap with Highway 7 by exiting the freeway and heading north toward Calion. This intersection also serves as the northern terminus for Highway 167B, with Highway 7 continuing north toward Smackover. Highway 167 runs north through sparsely populated parts of southern Calhoun County prior to entering Hampton, the county seat. The highway intersects U.S. Highway 278 (Main Street) and passes by the historic Calhoun County Courthouse and the Hampton Waterworks, both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the northern part of the county, Highway 167 meets another of its three business routes in the state, which runs into downtown Thornton. Highway 167 continues northeast to a junction with U.S. Highway 79, and the two routes begin a concurrency toward Fordyce. History =Original southern terminus and extensions= US 167 was designated in November 1926 as one of the original routes of the numbered U.S. Highway system. At that time, it was a much shorter route with a southern terminus at US 71 between Aloha and Colfax, northwest of Alexandria. The entire route within Louisiana followed an auto trail organized in 1919 known as the Pershing Way. Like the more well-known and established Jefferson Highway, the Pershing Way was promoted as an international highway stretching from New Orleans to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. However, the two followed entirely different routes through Louisiana that intersected in Alexandria. While the Jefferson Highway traveled diagonally across the state, the Pershing Way made an \\"L\\" by heading west from New Orleans to Lafayette via the Old Spanish Trail (another auto trail and the predecessor of US 90) before turning north and cutting through the center of the state. When Louisiana implemented a numbering system for its state highways in 1921, the Pershing Way was designated as State Route 5. Once the state began signposting its U.S. Highways in 1928,The Morning Advocate. May 2, 1928. they remained co-signed with their respective state designations until a renumbering of the system in 1955 eliminated such concurrencies. Since its creation in 1926, the southern terminus of US 167 has been moved twice. In 1932, the highway was shifted south of Winnfield to follow State Route 99, an early addition to the state highway system that had recently been paved. This change took the highway through Dry Prong to a different junction with US 71 near Creola, slightly extending the route and allowing a more direct connection with Alexandria. The original alignment was a gravel route that followed what is now LA 471 through Verda to Atlanta and LA 34 from Atlanta to Winnfield. US 167 assumed its full length in Louisiana in 1949, when the designation was extended over existing highways southward to Abbeville. State Route 43 carried the highway from Abbeville to Lafayette with the old Pershing Way (Route 5) taking it from there as far as Nuba, a point between Opelousas and Washington. The remainder of the distance to Alexandria was primarily composed of State Route 22 to Ville Platte, State Route 23 to Bayou Chicot, State Route 218 to Turkey Creek, State Route 26 to Meeker, and the concurrent US 71/State Route 1 into the city. =Early routings and special routes in Alexandria and Lafayette= In Alexandria, US 167 initially followed a path similar to its current business route and that of US 165\\\\. I-49 and the Pineville Expressway did not yet exist, and the primary through-town route followed MacArthur Drive, Lee Street, Bolton Avenue, and Murray Street into the downtown area. The highway crossed the Red River via the Murray Street Bridge, now demolished and replaced with the parallel Jackson Street Bridge. It continued through Pineville on Main Street, Military Highway, and Jefferson Highway to the modern junction of US 71 and US 165\\\\. The route then followed US 71 to Tioga and LA 3225 to Creola. Shortly after its extension through Alexandria, a bypass route for US 167 was designated that followed MacArthur Drive (then known as the Alexandria Bypass) around the city and across the O.K. Allen Bridge upriver. Portions of this route were part of the existing US 71 Byp. and a new US 165 Byp. By 1953, mainline US 167 was routed over the O.K. Allen Bridge via Bolton Avenue, and the bypass was truncated to the intersection of Bolton Avenue and MacArthur Drive, which was a traffic circle at that time. This routing remained in effect until the early 1960s when US 167 was moved out of Downtown Alexandria altogether and absorbed the bypass route, which was then deleted. In Lafayette, the route's other urbanized area, US 167 followed Johnston Street into town as it does today. However, it originally turned north onto University Avenue (then known as College Avenue) across US 90 and followed the present route of LA 182 through Carencro, Sunset, and Opelousas. The portion along University Avenue between Johnston and Cameron Streets in Lafayette was concurrent with US 90, as the Evangeline Thruway did not yet exist. Over the years, US 90 was shifted back-and-forth from its original routing through the courthouse square (with University Avenue signed as a bypass route) to the University Avenue alignment (with the courthouse alignment signed as a business route). During one short period in the mid-1950s when the former configuration was in effect, mainline US 167 was also routed through the courthouse square with a bypass route designated along University Avenue. The courthouse square route was as follows: Johnston Street, Jefferson Street, Main Street, St. John Street, and Cameron Street to University Avenue. Major intersections Bannered and suffixed routes =Alexandria business route= U.S. Highway 167 Business (US 167 Bus.) runs in a north‚Äìsouth direction through the Rapides Parish city of Alexandria. It follows the former path of US 167 through town before it was shifted onto the newly completed I-49 in 1994. From the south, US 167 Bus. begins at an interchange with I-49 (exit 80) and US 71 (exit 63) at the southern end of Alexandria. Mainline US 167 travels concurrently with I-49 to the north of the interchange and US 71 to the south. The business route heads northwest on MacArthur Drive, a divided four-lane highway with frontage roads, co-signed with US 71\\\\. It then turns northward onto Lee Street and becomes an undivided four-lane highway. After serving as a corridor for small commercial establishments for nearly , US 167 Bus. cuts through a residential neighborhood via the one-way pair of Mason and Overton Streets. A dozen blocks later, the route reaches an intersection with Bringhurst Street. Here, US 167 Bus. proceeds straight ahead co-signed with LA 1 and LA 28 Bus. The travel lanes converge as the highway immediately heads through an underpass of the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) line and crosses under both the elevated I-49 and Pineville Expressway (US 167/LA 28). For the next four blocks, US 167 Bus. diverges again onto the one-way pair of Casson and Fulton Streets near the southeast corner of the downtown area, effectively serving as frontage roads of the Pineville Expressway. Ramps connect to southbound I-49/US 167 and to the Pineville Expressway (northbound US 167 and eastbound LA 28) as the latter increases in elevation to cross the Red River via the twin-span Purple Heart Memorial Bridge into Pineville. US 167 Bus. is classified as an urban principal arterial by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). The average daily traffic volume in 2013 ranged from 7,300 to 24,400 vehicles with the highest counts recorded near the I-49 and US 167 interchanges at either end of the route. The posted speed limit is along MacArthur Drive, reduced to otherwise. Major intersections =El Dorado business route= US Highway 167 Business (US 167B and Hwy. 167B) is a business route of US Highway 167 in Union County, Arkansas. =Thornton business route= US Highway 167 Business (US 167B and Hwy. 167B) is a business route of US Highway 167 in Calhoun County, Arkansas. The route was created following the completion of a bypass around Thornton when Highway 167 was rerouted onto the new alignment. =Sheridan business route= US Highway 167 Business (US 167B and Hwy. 167B) is a business route of US Highway 167 in Grant County, Arkansas. It was created by the Arkansas State Highway Commission on September 11, 2013 following the designation of the new Highway 167 Sheridan bypass as mainline Highway 167, leaving the former alignment in the state highway system as a business route.

Basic form Insert statements have the following form: The number of columns and values must be the same. If a column is not specified, the default value for the column is used. The values specified (or implied) by the statement must satisfy all the applicable constraints (such as primary keys, constraints, and constraints). If a syntax error occurs or if any constraints are violated, the new row is not added to the table and an error returned instead. Example: INSERT INTO phone_book (name, number) VALUES ('John Doe', '555-1212'); Shorthand may also be used, taking advantage of the order of the columns when the table was created. It is not required to specify all columns in the table since any other columns will take their default value or remain null: Example for inserting data into 2 columns in the phone_book table and ignoring any other columns which may be after the first 2 in the table. INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES ('John Doe', '555-1212'); Advanced forms =Multirow inserts= A SQL feature (since SQL-92) is the use of row value constructors to insert multiple rows at a time in a single SQL statement: INSERT INTO tablename (column-a, [column-b, ...]) VALUES ('value-1a', ['value-1b', ...]), ('value-2a', ['value-2b', ...]), ... This feature is supported by DB2, SQL Server (since version 10.0 - i.e. 2008), PostgreSQL (since version 8.2), MySQL, SQLite (since version 3.7.11) and H2. Example (assuming that 'name' and 'number' are the only columns in the 'phone_book' table): INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES ('John Doe', '555-1212'), ('Peter Doe', '555-2323'); which may be seen as a shorthand for the two statements INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES ('John Doe', '555-1212'); INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES ('Peter Doe', '555-2323'); Note that the two separate statements may have different semantics (especially with respect to statement triggers) and may not provide the same performance as a single multi-row insert. To insert multiple rows in MS SQL you can use such a construction: INSERT INTO phone_book SELECT 'John Doe', '555-1212' UNION ALL SELECT 'Peter Doe', '555-2323'; Note that this is not a valid SQL statement according to the SQL standard (SQL:2003) due to the incomplete subselect clause. To do the same in Oracle use the DUAL table, which always consists of a single row only: INSERT INTO phone_book SELECT 'John Doe', '555-1212' FROM DUAL UNION ALL SELECT 'Peter Doe','555-2323' FROM DUAL A standard-conforming implementation of this logic shows the following example, or as shown above: INSERT INTO phone_book SELECT 'John Doe', '555-1212' FROM LATERAL ( VALUES (1) ) AS t(c) UNION ALL SELECT 'Peter Doe','555-2323' FROM LATERAL ( VALUES (1) ) AS t(c) Oracle PL/SQL supports the statement, where multiple insert statements are terminated by a : INSERT ALL INTO phone_book VALUES ('John Doe', '555-1212') INTO phone_book VALUES ('Peter Doe', '555-2323') SELECT * FROM DUAL; In Firebird inserting multiple rows can be achieved like this: INSERT INTO phone_book (\\"name\\", \\"number\\") SELECT 'John Doe', '555-1212' FROM RDB$DATABASE UNION ALL SELECT 'Peter Doe', '555-2323' FROM RDB$DATABASE; Firebird, however, restricts the number of rows than can be inserted in this way, since there is a limit to the number of contexts that can be used in a single query. =Copying rows from other tables= An statement can also be used to retrieve data from other tables, modify it if necessary and insert it directly into the table. All this is done in a single SQL statement that does not involve any intermediary processing in the client application. A subselect is used instead of the clause. The subselect can contain joins, function calls, and it can even query the same table into which the data is inserted. Logically, the select is evaluated before the actual insert operation is started. An example is given below. INSERT INTO phone_book2 SELECT * FROM phone_book WHERE name IN ('John Doe', 'Peter Doe') A variation is needed when some of the data from the source table is being inserted into the new table, but not the whole record. (Or when the tables' schemas are not the same.) INSERT INTO phone_book2 ( [name], [phoneNumber] ) SELECT [name], [phoneNumber] FROM phone_book WHERE name IN ('John Doe', 'Peter Doe') The statement produces a (temporary) table, and the schema of that temporary table must match with the schema of the table where the data is inserted into. =Default Values= It is possible to insert a new row without specifying any data, using default values for all columns. However, some databases reject the statement if no data is given, such as Microsoft SQL Server, and in this case the keyword can be used. INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES ( DEFAULT ) Sometimes databases also support alternative syntax for this; for example, MySQL allows omitting the keyword, and T-SQL can use instead of . The keyword can also be used in normal insertion to explicitly fill a column using that column's default value: INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES ( DEFAULT, '555-1212' ) What happens when a column does not specify a default value is database dependent. For example, MySQL and SQLite will fill in with a blank value (except when in strict mode), while many other databases will reject the statement. Retrieving the key Database designers that use a surrogate key as the primary key for every table will run into the occasional scenario where they need to automatically retrieve the database-generated primary key from an SQL statement for use in other SQL statements. Most systems do not allow SQL statements to return row data. Therefore, it becomes necessary to implement a workaround in such scenarios. Common implementations include: * Using a database-specific stored procedure that generates the surrogate key, performs the operation, and finally returns the generated key. For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, the key is retrieved via the special function, while in SQLite the function is named . * Using a database-specific statement on a temporary table containing last inserted row(s). DB2 implements this feature in the following way: *: SELECT * FROM NEW TABLE ( INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES ( 'Peter Doe','555-2323' ) ) AS t **DB2 for z/OS implements this feature in the following way. **: SELECT EMPNO, HIRETYPE, HIREDATE FROM FINAL TABLE ( INSERT INTO EMPSAMP (NAME, SALARY, DEPTNO, LEVEL) VALUES(‚ÄôMary Smith‚Äô, 35000.00, 11, ‚ÄôAssociate‚Äô) ); * Using a statement after the statement with a database- specific function that returns the generated primary key for the most recently inserted row. For example, for MySQL. * Using a unique combination of elements from the original SQL in a subsequent statement. * Using a GUID in the SQL statement and retrieving it in a statement. * Using the clause in the SQL statement for MS-SQL Server 2005 and MS-SQL Server 2008. * Using an statement with clause for Oracle. *: INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES ( 'Peter Doe','555-2323' ) RETURNING phone_book_id INTO v_pb_id * Using an statement with clause for PostgreSQL (since 8.2). The returned list is identical to the result of a . **Firebird has the same syntax in Data Modification Language statements (DSQL); the statement may add at most one row. In stored procedures, triggers and execution blocks (PSQL) the aforementioned Oracle syntax is used. **: INSERT INTO phone_book VALUES ( 'Peter Doe','555-2323' ) RETURNING phone_book_id * Using the function in H2 returns the last identity inserted. *: SELECT IDENTITY(); Triggers If triggers are defined on the table on which the statement operates, those triggers are evaluated in the context of the operation. triggers allow the modification of the values that shall be inserted into the table. triggers cannot modify the data anymore, but can be used to initiate actions on other tables, for example, to implement auditing mechanism.

Route description =Oklahoma= US 169 is a major north‚Äìsouth highway spanning in Oklahoma. The southern terminus for US 169 is Memorial Drive. The highway connects Tulsa, Oklahoma to the south with the Kansas state border to the north at South Coffeyville, Oklahoma. US 169 travels through Tulsa, Rogers, and Nowata counties. US 169 has undergone several widening projects that have brought US 169 to freeway and expressway standards. The highway is two lanes between Talala, Oklahoma and South Coffeyville except for a short four-lane portion north of Nowata, Oklahoma and ending at State Highway 28. An Alternate US 169 passes through Nowata following the original path of US 169\\\\. The alternate route begins at the intersection of Choctaw Avenue and reconnects with US 169 south of Nowata at its intersection with Maple Street. In January 2005, Oklahoma Department of Transportation began a $16.8 million widening project on a mile-long stretch of US 169 (officially named 'Pearl Harbor Memorial Expressway', although this name is rarely used by Tulsans) from Interstate 244 (I-244) to I-44. The project widened the highway from four to six lanes, adding one lane in each direction. The project was completed in April 2006. This stretch of US 169 is traveled by approximately 106,000 vehicles per day. =Kansas= US 169 enters the state at Coffeyville as a four-lane road, and is a four-lane highway for about till the edge of the Coffeyville Industrial Park. A segment between Chanute and Iola is a freeway with fully controlled access with center concrete barrier, with two lanes in each direction. US 169 runs concurrently with US 59 and K-31 starting about south of Garnett and diverges northeast again immediately south of Garnett. The intersection immediately south of Garnett used to be a \\"braided\\" intersection with Stop and Yield signs. It was identified as a high crash location in 2001, and was rebuilt as a roundabout that opened in April 2006.Slide 1 The Kansas Department of Transportation is rebuilding or planning to rebuild several other rural intersections as roundabouts for increased safety. In Garnett, 6th Avenue (from US 169 to US 59 is also known as Business US 169\\\\. Going south, it veers off from US 169 about a mile and a half north of the US 169/US 59/K-31 roundabout intersection and travels west and south on 6th Avenue from US 169 to US 59/K-31 (Maple St.) before turning south onto US 59/K-31 and running concurrently with them, ending at the US 169/US 59/K-31 roundabout intersection.http://www.ksdot.org/burtrafficeng/Roundabouts/Roundabout_Guide/Appendix_C.pdfSlide 1 At Osawatomie the road becomes a full freeway; as well as, running concurrent with K-7. In southern Johnson County 169 becomes an expressway until its junction with I-35 in Olathe. From this point to the Missouri state line, US 169 alternates between freeways and surface streets. It follows I-35 to Shawnee Mission Parkway in Overland Park, then travels east to Rainbow Boulevard. US 169 then follows surface streets to its junction with I-70 near downtown Kansas City. US 169 and I-70 enter Missouri together just after crossing the Kansas River. =Missouri= The Buck O'Neil Bridge carries US 169 over the Missouri River in Kansas City US 169 exits I-70 shortly after both roads enter Missouri via the Lewis and Clark Viaduct. It crosses the Missouri River by the Buck O'Neil Bridge and serves Kansas City Downtown Airport. Northbound, US 169 becomes a freeway at 5th Street south of the Missouri River, however southbound it ceases being a freeway north of the airport. An at-grade private driveway exists just south of the intersection with Route 9 as well as for airport access. At the northern end of the city an intersection is being reconstructed at NE 108th Street with completion in November 2013. Once this is completed it will be a freeway through I-435. This segment is also known as Arrowhead Trafficway, although this road neither passes nor approaches Arrowhead Stadium. US 169 is a four-lane rural expressway until it reaches Smithville, where it reverts to a two-lane rural highway. In St. Joseph, it forms most of the Belt Highway, a major commercial strip on the eastern edge of town, paralleling just inside I-29. US 169 angles northeastward out of St. Joseph, passing through many rural communities before exiting Missouri north of Grant City. US 169 intersects I-29 three times in Missouri: once in Gladstone, and twice in St. Joseph. =Iowa= US 169 runs north in Kossuth County, Iowa US 169 enters Iowa just south of Redding. It intersects I-80 near De Soto. US 169 becomes an expressway at US 20, south of Fort Dodge. At Iowa Highway 7 on the northwest side of Fort Dodge it reverts to a two-lane highway again. This is changing, however, as a two-phase, $11 million project began in the spring of 2010 to widen the route to four lanes from Fort Dodge to Humboldt. US 169 passes through Humboldt and Algona before it leaves Iowa north of Lakota. =Minnesota= US 169 is a major north‚Äìsouth highway in Minnesota. It enters the state at Elmore. Shortly after, it junctions with I-90 at Blue Earth. It passes Mankato, crossing the Minnesota River. Between Mankato and the Twin Cities, US 169 is largely a rural highway. Before entering Le Sueur, US 169 crosses the Minnesota River again. At Shakopee, US 169 becomes a freeway, crossing the Minnesota River for a third time. The freeway ends in Champlin. US 169 crosses the Mississippi River at Anoka and follows concurrently with US 10 to Elk River, where US 169 splits off northbound through central Minnesota. The rest of the route in Minnesota is largely rural. The route passes the western side of Mille Lacs Lake. It terminates at US 53 in Virginia, in the Iron Range. History In Kansas, US 169 used run concurrent with US 69 from I-35 through Downtown Kansas City, Kansas and the Fairfax District across the Platte Purchase Bridge to I-635 until splitting at I-29 in Missouri. In Missouri, US 169 replaced Route 1 from Kansas City to St. Joseph, Route 4 from St. Joseph to Stanberry, and all of Route 29 from Stanberry to Iowa. The part of Route 1 north of Kansas City had been Route 33 south of, and Route 50 north of, Grayson from 1922 to 1926. Prior to 2008, US 169 traveled east on I-435 in Lenexa and Overland Park, Kansas, and then it traveled north on Metcalf Avenue. Prior to 1981, US 169 entered Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The alternate route travels through Nowata while the main highway bypasses the town. The alternate route is approximately long. Junction list =Garnett business route= U.S. 169 has one special route while in Kansas, Business Route 169. The business route northern terminus is the junction of U.S. 169 & 6th Avenue in Garnett. The main highway bypasses the town to the Southeast. The business route travels along 6th Avenue until reaching Maple Street where it intersects with U.S. 59 and K-31 until it ends at its intersection with U.S. 169 at a roundabout South of Garnett in Anderson County, Kansas. =Smithville spur= U.S. Route 169 Spur is a route in Smithville, Missouri. The spur route follows an old alignment of US 169 into the city center of Smithville ending at Main Street. =Fort Dodge business loop= U.S. Route 169 Business is a business route in Fort Dodge, Iowa. The route was established in 1990 along former sections of Iowa Highway 7 (Iowa 7) and U.S. Route 20. Iowa 7 had recently been truncated to its current eastern end at U.S. Route 169 and US 20 had been rerouted onto a new freeway south of Fort Dodge. Since both routes had viaducts over the Des Moines River, officials in Fort Dodge wanted the Iowa Department of Transportation to maintain the bridges. From its creation until 2014, the route was officially known as Iowa Highway 926, but it was only signed as Business US 169.

I think that the songs should be distributed chiefly among the Bulgarians, and this is why I have fixed a low price...\\" The first biography of the Miladinov brothers, written by their brother-in-law Kuzman Shapkarev and issued in Plovdiv, 1884.According to Shapkarev himself: \\"Until then, [1857-1859, when the Miladinovs launched their educational campaign], everyone acknowledged them to be a Bulgarian.\\" The Miladinov brothers (, Bratya Miladinovi, , Brakja Miladinovci), Dimitar Miladinov (1810‚Äì1862) and Konstantin Miladinov (1830‚Äì1862), were poets, folklorists and activists of the Bulgarian national movement in the region of Macedonia.In the announcement by the Miladinov Brothers about the subscription for their collection called Bulgarian Folk Songs, published in Belgrade by Konstantin Miladinov on February 7, 1861 in the Bulgarian newspaper Dunavski Lebed, issue ‚Ññ 20, he wrote: \\"We started collecting folk songs six years ago from all parts of Western Bulgaria, i.e. Macedonia... as well as from Eastern Bulgaria. These folk songs will be supplemented with traditional rites of betrothal and match- making from Struga and Kukush; proverbs, riddles, legends and about 2,000 words which have become obsolete or differ from other dialects\\". For more see: D. Kossev et al., Macedonia, documents and materials, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, (in English) Sofia, 1978, p. 48.On 8 January 1861, K. Miladinov wrote to the Bulgarian weakener G. Rakovski to explain his use of the term ‚Äò‚ÄòBulgarian‚Äô‚Äô in the title of his and his brother‚Äôs collection of Macedonian folk songs: ‚Äò‚ÄòIn the announcement I called Macedonia West Bulgaria (as it should be called) because in Vienna the Greeks treat us like sheep.

Another famous poem by Konstantin Miladinov is Taga za Yug, that he wrote during his stay in Russia. In North Macedonia they are also thought to have laid the foundation of the Macedonian national awakening and literary tradition.Some researchers and publicists argue that during the Ottoman period the term Bulgarian was not used to designate ethnic affiliation, rather to designate different sociocultural categories, see: The Macedonian Conflict by Loring M. Danforth. Their hometown hosts the international Struga Poetry Evenings festival in their honour including a poetry award named after them. However, today the general public there has no access to all original works of the Brothers by political reasons.  Dimitar Miladinov  Dimitar Miladinov Dimitar Miladinov was born in Struga, Ottoman Empire (in what is now the Republic of North Macedonia) in 1810. His mother was Sultana and father Hristo Miladinov. With the assistance from friends, Dimitar was sent to Ioannina, at that time, a prominent Greek educational center. He had absorbed much of the Greek culture including their classics, and became proficient in the Greek language. In 1829, he stayed in the Saint Naum monastery in Ohrid to continue his education, and in 1830 he became a teacher in Ohrid. Meanwhile, his father died, and his brother was born - Konstantin Miladinov. The Miladinov family had eight children ‚Äî six boys and two girls: Dimitar (the oldest), Atanas, Mate, Apostol, Naum, Konstantin, Ana and Krsta. In 1832, he moved to Durr√´s, working in the local trade chamber. From 1833 through 1836 he studied in Ioannina, preparing to become teacher. Eventually he returned to Ohrid and began teaching. In 1836, he introduced a new teaching method in his classroom.Freedom Or Death: The Life of Gots√© Delchev, Mercia MacDermott, Pluto Press, 1978, , p. 17. He increased the school programme with new subjects, such as philosophy, arithmetics, geography, Old Greek and Greek literature, Latin and French. Soon he became popular and respected among his students and peers. After two years, he left Ohrid and returned to Struga. From 1840 to 1842, he was a teacher in Kukush, today in Greece. He became active in the town's social life, strongly opposing the phanariotes. At the instigation of Dimitar Miladinov, and with the full approval of the city fathers, in 1858, the use of the Greek language was banished from the churches and substituted with the Old Bulgarian. In 1859 he received word that Ohrid had officially demanded, from the Turkish government, the restoration of Bulgarian Patriarchate. Dimitar Miladinov left Kukush and headed for Ohrid to help. There he translated Bible texts in the Bulgarian language (considered in the Republic of North Macedonia as Macedonian). Dimitar Miladinov tried to introduce the Bulgarian language into the Greek school in Prilep in 1856 causing an angry reaction from the local Grecomans. In a letter to \\"Tsarigradski Vestnik\\" of February 28, 1860, he reports: \\"‚Ä¶In the entire country of Ohrid, there is not a single Greek family, except three or four villages of Vlahs. All of the rest of the population is pure Bulgarian.‚Ä¶\\"–¢—Ä–∞–π–∫–æ–≤, –ù. –ë—Ä–∞—Ç—è –ú–∏–ª–∞–¥–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∏.–ü—Ä–µ–ø–∏—Å–∫–∞.1964 —Å. 43, 44 Angered by this act of the citizens of Ohrid and their leader, the Greek Bishop Miletos denounced Miladinov as a Russian agent. He was accused of spreading pan-Slavic ideas and was imprisoned in Istanbul later to be joined by his supporting brother Konstantin. In January 1862 both brothers died in prison from typhus.  Konstantin Miladinov  Konstantin Miladinov Konstantin Miladinov was the youngest son in the family of the potter Hristo Miladinov. He was born in 1830 in Struga. He studied in a few different places throughout his life but the very first teacher was his older brother Dimitar. After his graduation from the Hellenic Institute at Ioannina and the University of Athens, where he studied literature, at the instigation of his brother, Dimitar, and following the example of many young Bulgarians of that period, in 1856, Konstantin went to Russia. Reaching Odessa, and short of money, the Bulgarian Society in that city financed his trip to Moscow. Konstantin enrolled at the Moscow University to study Slavic philology. While at the University of Athens, he was exposed, exclusively, to the teachings and thinking of ancient and modern Greek scholars. In Moscow, he came in contact with prominent Slavic writers and intellectuals, scarcely mentioned in any of the Greek textbooks. But while in Moscow he could not suppress his desire to see the River Volga. At the time of his youth, the universal belief was that the Bulgars had camped on the banks of the legendary river, had crossed it on their way to the Balkans and the origin of the name Bulgarians had come from the Russian River - Volga. Reaching its shores, Konstantin stood before it in awe, fascinated, unable to utter a word, his eyes following the flowing waters. A poet at heart, he poured his exaltations in a letter to one of his friends: \\"‚Ä¶O,Volga, Volga! What memories you awake in me, how you drive me to bury myself in the past! High are your waters, Volga. I and my friend, also a Bulgarian, we dived and proudly told ourselves that, at this very moment, we received our true baptismal.‚Ä¶\\"–ü–µ—Ç—ä—Ä –î–∏–Ω–µ–∫–æ–≤, –î–µ–ª–æ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –±—Ä–∞—Ç—è –ú–∏–ª—è–¥–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∏.

While in Russia he helped his older brother Dimitar in editing the materials for the collection of Bulgarian songs, that have been collected by Dimitar in his field work. The collection was subsequently published in Croatia with the support of the bishop Josip Strosmayer, who was one of the patrons of Slavonic literature at that time. Konstantin established contact with Josip Juraj Strossmayer and early in 1860, when he heard that the Bishop would be in Vienna, he left Moscow and headed for the Austrian capital to meet his future benefactor. Very glad that he printed the book, on the way back he received the bad news that his brother was jailed. With the thought of helping his brother, he went in Tsarigrad. Denounced by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as a dangerous Russian agent, he was arrested. It is not clear whether he was placed in the same cell with his brother, or whether the two brothers saw each other. Very soon both of them became ill and in a matter of few days died.  Significance  Konstantin Miladinov (right), together with the Bulgarian national activists Lyuben Karavelov and Petar Hadzhipeev in Moscow, 1858. The two brothers' educationalist activity and deaths ensured them a worthy place in the history of the Bulgarian cultural movement and the Bulgarian national liberation struggle in the 19th century. The brothers are known also for their keen interest in Bulgarian folk poetry as a result of which the collection \\"Bulgarian Folk Songs\\" appeared. The songs were collected between 1854 and 1860 mostly by the elder brother, Dimitar, who taught in several Macedonian towns (Ohrid, Struga, Prilep, Kukush and Bitola) and was able to put into writing the greater part of the 660 folk songs. The songs from the Sofia District were supplied by the Sofia schoolmaster Sava Filaretov. Those from Panagyurishte area, were recorded by Marin Drinov and Nesho Bonchev, but were sent by Vasil Cholakov. Rayko Zhinzifov, who went to Russia with the help of D. Miladinov, was another collaborator. Dimitar and Konstantin Miladinovi were aware of the great significance of the folklore in the period of the national revival and did their best to collect the best poetic writing which the Bulgarian people had created throughout the ages. Their activity in this field is indicative of the growing interest shown towards folklore by the Bulgarian intelligentsia in the middle of the 19th century ‚Äì by Vasil Aprilov, Nayden Gerov, Georgi Rakovski, Petko Slaveykov, etc. The collecting was highly assessed by its contemporaries - Lyuben Karavelov, Nesho Bonchev, Ivan Bogorov, Kuzman Shapkarev, Rayko Zhinzifov and others. The collection was met with great interest by foreign scholars. The Russian scholar Izmail Sreznevsky pointed out in 1863: \\"‚Ä¶It can be seen by the published collection that the Bulgarians far from lagging behind other peoples in poetic abilities even surpass them with the vitality of their poetry‚Ä¶\\" Soon parts of the collection were translated in Czech, Russian and German. Elias Riggs, an American linguist in Constantinople, translated nine songs into English and sent them to the American Oriental Society in Princeton, New Jersey. In a letter from in June 1862, Riggs wrote: \\"‚Ä¶The whole present an interesting picture of the traditions and fancies prevailing among the mass of the Bulgarian people‚Ä¶\\" The collection compiled by the Miladinov brothers also played a great role in the development of the modern Bulgarian literature, because its songs as poetic models for the outstanding Bulgarian poets ‚Äì Ivan Vazov, Pencho Slaveikov, Kiril Hristov, Peyo Yavorov, etc.–õ—é–ª–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–∞ –∏ –Ω–æ–≤–∞—Ç–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –ø–∏—Å–º–µ–Ω–æ—Å—Ç. –ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏–∫ –ï–º–∏–ª –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–µ–≤, (–î—ä—Ä–∂–∞–≤–Ω–æ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Å–≤–µ—Ç–∞, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è 1980)–ü–µ—Ç—ä—Ä –î–∏–Ω–µ–∫–æ–≤. –î–µ–ª–æ—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –±—Ä–∞—Ç—è –ú–∏–ª–∞–¥–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∏.(–ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –∞–∫–¥–µ–º–∏—è –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—É–∫–∏—Ç–µ, 1961 –≥.)

At that time the Macedonian Slavs who had clear ethnic consciousness believed they were Bulgarians.\\"Until the late 19th century both outside observers and those Bulgaro-Macedonians who had an ethnic consciousness believed that their group, which is now two separate nationalities, comprised a single people, the Bulgarians. Thus the reader should ignore references to ethnic Macedonians in the Middle ages which appear in some modern works. In the Middle ages and into the 19th century, the term ‚ÄòMacedonian‚Äô was used entirely in reference to a geographical region. Anyone who lived within its confines, regardless of nationality could be called a Macedonian...Nevertheless, the absence of a national consciousness in the past is no grounds to reject the Macedonians as a nationality today.\\" \\"The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century,\\" John Van Antwerp Fine, University of Michigan Press, 1991, , pp. 36‚Äì37.

In fact Miladinovs worried that use of this name would imply identification of the local Slavs with the Greek nation and preferred Bulgarian one.Miladinov suggested that Macedonia should be called ‚ÄúWestern Bulgaria‚Äù. Obviously, he was aware that the classical designation was received via Greek schooling and culture. As the Macedonian histotrian Taskovski claims, the Macedonian Slavs initially rejected the Macedonian designation as Greek.

He published the volume with his brother Konstantin (1830-1862) and even though most of the songs were from Macedonia, the authors disliked this term as too Hellenic and preferred to refer to Macedonia as the \\"Western Bulgarian lands\\". For more see: Chris Kostov, Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, Peter Lang, 2010, , p. 72.The struggle over the historical legacy of the name ‚ÄúMacedonia‚Äù was already under way in the nineteenth century, as the Greeks contested its appropriation by the Slavs. This is reflected in a letter from Konstantin Miladinov, who published Bulgarian folk songs from Macedonia, to Georgi Rakovski, dated 31 January 1861:On my order form I have called Macedonia ‚ÄúWestern Bulgaria‚Äù, as it should be called, because the Greeks in Vienna are ordering us around like sheep. They want Macedonia to be Greek territory and still do not realize that it cannot be Greek. But what are we to do with the more than two million Bulgarians there? Shall the Bulgarians still be sheep and a few Greeks the shepherds? Those days are gone and the Greeks shall be left with no more than their sweet dream. I believe the songs will be distributed among the Bulgarians, and have therefore set a low price for them.

ISSN 2241-1674. Available at: . However, in postwar Yugoslav Macedonia the original book \\"Bulgarian Folk Songs\\" was hidden from the general public. Suitably edited textbooks were published there into the newly codified Macedonian language, to support the promulgation of a new Macedonian nation.Who Are the Macedonians? Hugh Poulton, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2000, , p. 117. In Macedonia, the Miladinov brothers were appropriated by the historians in Communist Yugoslavia as part of Macedonian National Revival. As a result generations of young people were taught at pseudo-history.The past was systematically falsified to conceal the fact that many prominent ‚ÄòMacedonians‚Äô had supposed themselves to be Bulgarians, and generations of students were taught the pseudo-history of the Macedonian nation. The mass media and education were the key to this process of national acculturation, speaking to people in a language that they came to regard as their Macedonian mothertongue, even if it was perfectly understood in Sofia.

The reference to Macedonia as Western Bulgaria in the foreword was removed, as well as every references to Bulgarian and Bulgarians were replaced with Macedonian and Macedonians.

As result the Macedonian State Archive displayed a counterfeit photocopy of the book in cooperation with the Soros Foundation and the text on the cover was simply \\"Folk Songs\\", the upper part of the page showing \\"Bulgarian\\" has been cut off. Although Miladinov brothers regarded their language Bulgarian, Macedonian researchers today proclaim their works as early literature in the Macedonian language.Michael Palairet, Macedonia: A Voyage through History (Vol. 2, From the Fifteenth Century to the Present), Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016, , p. 102. However, there was no standardized neither Bulgarian nor Macedonian language at that time with which to conform.The Bulgarian Ministry of Education officially codified a standard Bulgarian language based on the Drinov-Ivanchev orthography in 1899, while Macedonian was finally codified in 1950 in Communist Yugoslavia, that finalized the progressive split in the common Macedonian‚ÄìBulgarian pluricentric area. The Bulgarian and Macedonian Slavs then worked to create a common literary standard,Bechev, Dimitar (2009). Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia Historical Dictionaries of Europe. Scarecrow Press. p. 134. . and the publicists in the Macedonian-Bulgarian linguistic area wrote in their own local dialect called simply Bulgarian.From Rum Millet to Greek and Bulgarian Nations: Religious and National Debates in the Borderlands of the Ottoman Empire, 1870‚Äì1913. Theodora Dragostinova, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. Today in North Macedonia are schools named after the Miladinov Brothers, but the pupils there do not have the access to the works of their schools' patrons in original. There is a similar case with the national museum of North Macedonia which, apparently, refuses to display original works by the two brothers, because of the Bulgarian labels on some of them.

It travels for from Liberal, Kansas at US 54 and US 83 to White Hall, Arkansas at Interstate 530 (I-530) and US 65\\\\. It travels through the states of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. It travels through the cities of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Hot Springs, Arkansas, and McAlester, Oklahoma. Route description =Kansas= US 270 begins in Liberal, Kan., and leaves the state three miles south of there. US 270 begins in the southeast part of Liberal, Kansas, at an intersection with US 83 (running north‚Äìsouth through the intersection) and US 54. US 270 follows the south leg of this intersection, following US 83 south. US 270 only spends in Kansas before crossing into Oklahoma. Seward County is the only Kansas county that US-270 serves. =Oklahoma= US 270 concurs with many highways in northwestern Oklahoma. US 270 enters Oklahoma in Beaver County, the eastern third of the Oklahoma Panhandle. From here it continues east along US 64, then south towards Beaver, the county seat, along SH-23. South of Beaver, the road joins with US 412 (OK) and SH-3, the latter of which US 270 will overlap with through most of northwest Oklahoma. After leaving the Panhandle and picking up US 183 near Fort Supply, the highways turn southwest towards Woodward. US 412 splits away in Woodward. US 270, concurrent with US 183 and SH-3, proceed southeast toward Seiling. West of Seiling, US 183 splits off to the south, but in Seiling, it is replaced by US 281. The routes continue southwest to Watonga, where US 270/281 turn south along SH-8, while SH-3 continues due east to concur with SH-33. In Geary, US 270 splits off on an independent alignment, looping through Calumet before joining with Interstate 40. US 270 remains concurrent with I-40 from Exit 115 through Exit 181, a distance of . US 270, attached to I-40, runs through the core of the Oklahoma City Metro area, passing through the western suburbs of El Reno and Yukon into Oklahoma City proper. The partnership runs just south of Downtown and the Bricktown entertainment district on the Crosstown Expressway. Major interchanges with I-44 and I-35 (the latter involving a concurrency with the interstate and its accompanying US Highway, US 62) are found in the city. I-40/US 270 also serve two eastern suburbs of Oklahoma City, Del City and Midwest City and form the northern boundary between Midwest City's civilian areas and Tinker Air Force Base. US-270 finally exits from I-40 on the west side of Shawnee. US 270 serves most of the towns anchoring the area east of Oklahoma City, including Shawnee, Tecumseh, Seminole, Wewoka, and Holdenville. It continues southeast to the city of McAlester, a major southeastern Oklahoma city. It also serves many of the small towns east of McAlester, such as Krebs, Alderson, Bache, Haileyville, and Hartshorne. After passing through Hartshorne, the roads curves to the northeast before turning onto a due east course taking it through Wilburton, Red Oak, and Wister. In Wister, it turns south, running across Wister Lake's dam, and proceeding southeast to Heavener. There, it meets US 59, which it will follow for the rest of its time in Oklahoma. The town highways head south from Heavener, passing through the Wister Wildlife Management Area before entering the Ouachita National Forest. The route serves as the northern terminus of US 259 near Page. The road then squeezes into a valley between Black Fork Mountain and Rich Mountain. In this valley, it crosses the state line into Arkansas. =Arkansas= U.S. Route 270 in Sheridan, Arkansas. US 270 enters Arkansas with US 59, and runs east to Acorn, where it meets US 71. The route then travels 15 miles north on US 71 to Y City where it splits off and continues east. The route then meets AR 88 in Pencil Bluff and AR 27 in Mt. Ida before heading to Hot Springs. Entering the city, US 270 meets US 70 southwest of town and runs concurrent with it around Hot Springs using the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway before leaving the freeway and running along Malvern Avenue southeast of the city. US 270 intersects with I-30 just outside Malvern, running a short distance northeast on the freeway before interchanging with the George Hopkins Loop bypass and running south around the city. After meeting with US 67 east of town, the alignment then turns east-southeast meeting AR 229 in Poyen and AR 190/AR 291 in Prattsville before crossing paths with US 167 in Sheridan. The route trails east towards Pine Bluff terminating at and interchanging with I-530/US 65 in White Hall. Directly east of this interchange, the highway used to continue along Sheridan Road before terminating at AR 365/Dollarway Road in northwest Pine Bluff. This former section of the route is now signed AR 365 Spur. History In Kansas, US-270 was truncated to Liberal, Kansas on May 18, 1981. In Arkansas, US-270 was formerly Highway 6. Future In Arkansas, it has been proposed that part of AR-51 will become part of US-270. On I-30's current concurrency with US-270, going east, drivers can take exit 99 and make a right on US-270 East. If drivers make a left when they take exit 99, they must make a left to get on I-30 West/US-270 West because there is currently no outlet past that. That road has been proposed to be extended to AR-51. This will form the future northern terminus of AR-51. This means that drivers can make a left to get on AR-51 South and will have to make a right to get on US-270 West. Then, US-270 will meet the current US-270. Drivers can make a left to get on the future US-270 Business East and must make a right to get on US-270 West, just like AR-51 did.

History Grand Rapids Junior College was established on September 21, 1914, after University of Michigan faculty passed a resolution encouraging the establishment of junior colleges in Michigan. Grand Rapids Junior College was the first junior college in Michigan. The college operated out of Central High School, 421 Fountain St. NE, until 1924. The course offerings, based on University of Michigan offerings, were mathematics, history, rhetoric and composition, German, Latin, biology, and physics. All of them were focused on college transfer. The college's first graduating class numbered 49 students, who paid $60 per year for tuition. The following year, to encourage enrollment, tuition was reduced to $40 per year for Grand Rapids residents and $50 for nonresidents. In 1918 Grand Rapids Junior College received its initial accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. In 1944 the college acquired the Main Building from Grand Rapids Public Schools. Grand Rapids Public Schools Superintendent Arthur W. Krause closed Davis Technical High School to save costs and gave the building to Grand Rapids Junior College. The Main Building was renamed the Raleigh J. Finkelstein Hall in March 2019. Campuses Grand Rapids Community College has several campuses located throughout West Michigan. GRCC's main Campus in located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. GRCC's downtown learning spaces include a Main Campus and DeVos Campus. These campuses are located adjacent to Grand Rapids Medical Mile and Heritage Hill Historic District. Due to its location in Downtown Grand Rapids, GRCC is close to local festivals and art shows such as ArtPrize and Festival of the Arts. The downtown campuses are within walking distance to museums, fitness facilities, restaurants and shops. In addition to the main campus, Grand Rapids Community College has the Lakeshore campus in Holland, Michigan. The Lakeshore campus is composed of six different buildings (locations). Classes offered at the Lakeshore campus are taught at West Ottawa high school north building, Grand Valley State University's Meijer Campus, the Careerline Technical Center, the Midtown Center, Patrick A. Thompson M-TEC, and Winding Creek Golf Course. Facilities GRCC's eleven-block downtown campus includes several classroom buildings, a learning center and library, Spectrum Theater, the Applied Technology Center, a remodeled music building, a fieldhouse with natatorium, a student center (including the Diversity Learning Center), Bostwick Commons, and the state-of-the-art Calkins Science Center. An off-campus ‚ÄúLearning Corner‚Äù has been added to serve the East Hills and Eastown neighborhoods as well as the greater Grand Rapids Community. Library and Learning Commons The Library & Learning Commons (LLC) is located on a hillside in downtown Grand Rapids and offers learner-centered services with the goal of creating successful students capable of continuing their studies or joining the educated workforce of Michigan. Many professors bring their classes to the LLC both for general research and classroom instruction. The library is supported by a staff of thirteen, half of whom hold professional library degrees. Study spaces are equipped with modern computer workstations, wireless technology, and flexible seating to facilitate collaboration. Collections include extensive licensed electronic resources and are further enhanced through participation in MEL, the Michigan eLibrary. Athletics Grand Rapids Community College's athletic teams compete as the Raiders in men's baseball, basketball, golf, and tennis, and in women's basketball, softball, tennis, and volleyball.http://www.braintrack.com/college/u/grand-rapids-community-college The college's teams participate in Michigan Community College Athletic Association (MCCAA) competition with the exception of the independent men's tennis team. The school has won 70 MCCAA titles and been awarded the MCCAA All-sports Trophy 13 times. GRCC is a member of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and has won numerous NJCAA district and regional championships and has appeared in national tournaments several times. The baseball team has won five NJCAA tournaments and the school has been national runner-up five times in five different sports. In addition, the Raiders' football team was honored by the NJCAA as the non-scholarship team national champion in 2005 and 2009, has played in national championship games in 1956, 1988, and 2005, and has played in ten other bowl games. The college does not participate in the MCCAA-sponsored sports of men's and women's cross country and men's soccer. Former GRCC varsity sports include men's cross country, swimming and diving, track and field, and wrestling, and women's swimming and diving. In January 2012, GRCC discontinued its football team.

Service history =USS Fairfax= Named in honor of Rear Admiral Donald Fairfax, she was launched 15 December 1917 by Mare Island Navy Yard; sponsored by Mrs. H. George; and commissioned 6 April 1918, Lieutenant Commander Stanford Caldwell Hooper in command. Fairfax arrived at Hampton Roads 6 June 1918 for convoy escort duty out of Newport News. She guarded convoys of troop transports to midocean meeting points with escorts who had come out of English and French ports to meet them. Fairfax also guarded convoys moving between coastal ports, and patrolled off the coast until 16 October, when she stood down Hampton Roads bound for Brest, France, escorting a troop convoy. On 18 October, she left her convoy to rescue 86 survivors of torpedoed , a Naval Overseas Transport Service ship, and on 27 October, arrived at Brest for patrol and escort duty in European waters. On 3 December 1918, Fairfax arrived in the Azores to meet and escort to Brest, the transport George Washington carrying President Woodrow Wilson to the Peace Conference. She sailed for home 21 December, reaching Norfolk, Virginia 8 January 1919. Her post war operations along the east coast and in the Caribbean were broken in May 1919, when she sailed to the Azores to take up station as an observer of the historic first aerial crossing of the Atlantic made by Navy seaplanes. On 19 June 1922, she was decommissioned at Philadelphia, and placed in reserve. Recommissioned 1 May 1930, Fairfax operated primarily on training cruises for members of the Naval Reserve during the following 2 years, based at Newport, Rhode Island, and Camden, New Jersey. On 12 March 1932 she sailed from Hampton Roads for San Diego, California, arriving 26 March. On the west coast, too, her primary duty was training reservists, but she also took part in gunnery exercises and fleet problems off Mexico, Central America, and the Panama Canal Zone. Fairfax took part in the Presidential Review taken by Franklin D. Roosevelt in San Diego in March 1933, and then sailed for the East coast, where she continued her reserve training duty. She also patrolled in Cuban waters, and in the summers of 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1940 sailed out of Annapolis training midshipmen of the Naval Academy. Between October 1935 and March 1937, she served with the Special Service Squadron out of Coco Solo and Balboa, Canal Zone, operating primarily on the Atlantic side of the Canal Zone. The destroyer joined in representing the United States Navy at the opening of the New York City World's Fair in April 1939, and after World War II broke out in Europe that fall, operated on neutrality patrol along with her training duties. On 21 November 1940, she arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she was decommissioned 26 November, and transferred to Great Britain under the destroyers for-land-bases exchange agreement. =HMS Richmond= The former Fairfax was commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS Richmond, with the pennant number G88, on 5 December 1940. She arrived at Plymouth, England, on 1 February 1941, undergoing a refit to better suit her for escort work. This refit was completed in March, but Richmond ran aground at Holyhead on 23 March while on passage to Liverpool, and was under repair at Southampton until June.Hague 1988, p. 70. Following repair, Richmond joined the Newfoundland Escort Force, responsible for escorting transatlantic convoys between Newfoundland and mid-Atlantic, when British based ships took over the escort.Hague 1988, p. 19. In October 1941, the ship returned across the Atlantic for refit at Cardiff, this continuing until December that year. Richmond then joined the 27th Escort Group based at Greenock on the Clyde. On 26 March Richmond formed part of the escort for the Arctic convoy PQ 14 on the initial leg from Scotland to Iceland, but was badly damaged in collision with the merchant ship Francis Scott Key and was under repair at Liverpool until July.Hague 1988, pp. 70‚Äì71. In September 1942, Richmond joined the Halifax, Nova Scotia based Western Local Escort Force, escorting convoys from North American ports to off Newfoundland. In February 1943 Richmond was involved in another collision, this time with the merchant ship SS Reinholt, being sent to Liverpool for repair. In June 1943, she returned to Halifax, and convoy operations along the Canadian coast, serving as part of the Royal Canadian Navy from June until December 1943, when to free her crew for more modern escorts, she returned to the United Kingdom and was laid up on the Tyne. On 16 July 1944 she was transferred to the Soviet Navy.Hague 1988, p. 71. =Zhivuchiy= The former Richmond was commissioned in the Soviet Navy as Zhivuchiy (rus. –ñ–∏–≤—É—á–∏–π, \\"Survivable\\") on 24 August 1944. On 17 August 1944, Zhivuchiy, as a member of the Russian Transfer Force, sailed to meet convoy JW 59. The convoy was attacked by U-boats until the convoy reached the Soviet Union on 25 August.Rohwer, p. 350 On 22‚Äì23 November Zhivuchiy was a member of the escort of convoy BK 38 comprising six transports and three tankers sailing from Archangel to Murmansk.Rohwer, p. 374 At the beginning of December 1944, Zhivuchiy was targeted by using a T5 acoustic torpedo. The torpedo missed and in response, the submarine was hunted by Zhivuchiy and Deyatelny. On 6 December, Zhivuchiy was among the Soviet vessels sent to augment the escort of convoy JW 62. The convoy arrived in the Soviet Union on 7 December. Before the return convoy RA 62 could sail, the Soviet Navy sent out a destroyer force, of which Zhivichiy was a part of, to attack U-boats lying in wait at the entrance to Kola Inlet. During the engagement, Zhivuchiy was targeted by on 9 December, which missed. The sinking of is disputed, with Soviet sources claiming Zhivuchiy rammed and sunk the submarine while Rohwer claims that sank the submarine using depth charges.Rohwer, p. 375 Zhivuchiy underway, towing a torpedo target From 3‚Äì5 January 1945, the Soviet convoy BK 41 sailed from Archangel to Murmansk composed of 14 ships. Zhivuchiy was part of the initial escort, however on 4 January the escort was strengthened. The convoy reached port safely.Rohwer, p. 384 On 7 January, Zhivuchiy sailed with convoy JW 63 as part of its escort. Eight merchant vessels were brought from Kola Inlet to Molotovsk.Rohwer, p. 385 On 16 January, Zhivuchiy was part of the covering group for Soviet convoy KB 1 sailing from Kola Inlet to the White Sea. On 21 and 24 January Zhivuchiy was among the destroyers sent to hunt U-boats between Jokanga and Kola.Rohwer, p. 387 On 5 February Zhivuchiy was among the escort for Soviet convoy BK 2 sailing from Archangel to Murmansk. On 11 February, the destroyer joined the escort of convoy JW 64 in order to escort 15 merchant vessels traveling to the White Sea.Rohwer, p. 392 On 16 February, Zhivuchiy was among the vessels sent to drive the gathered U-boats from the entrance to Kola Inlet.Rohwer, p. 393 Zhivuchiy was among the Soviet escorts for convoy RA 65 from Archangel to the Barents Sea from 21‚Äì25 March 1945.Rohwer, p. 399 The Soviet Union returned the ship on 24 June 1949 to Britain, which sold her for scrap in July of that year.Hague 1988, p. 71.

The U.S. Highway runs from US 25 Business and North Carolina Highway 225 (NC 225) in Hendersonville, North Carolina, east to US 52 in Goose Creek, South Carolina. US 176 serves the transition region between the Blue Ridge Mountains and Foothills of Western North Carolina and the Upstate, Midlands, and Lowcountry regions of South Carolina. The highway passes through and connects Spartanburg, one of two major cities in the Upstate, and Columbia, the South Carolina state capital and central city of the Midlands. US 176 parallels and serves as a secondary highway to Interstate 26 (I-26) except for between Spartanburg and Columbia, where the U.S. Highway deviates from the I-26 corridor to serve Union. Route description US 176 spans in North Carolina and runs in South Carolina. The U.S. Highway is a part of the National Highway System in four locations in South Carolina. US 176 is part of the national system from I-85 Business near Spartanburg to South Carolina Highway 295 (SC 295) near Pacolet, during which the U.S. Highway is concurrent with either I-585 or SC 9. The highway's second stretch of National Highway System is along its concurrency with SC 72 around Whitmire. US 176 is also part of the system along its concurrencies with US 21, US 76, and US 321 on Elmwood Street and Huger Street north of SC 12 in Columbia. The highway's final section in which it is included in the National Highway System is during its concurrency with US 21 and US 321 from I-26 in Cayce to where US 321 splits from US 176 and US 21 south of Cayce. =Hendersonville to Spartanburg= Hendersonville US 176 begins at the southern end of Main Street in the city of Hendersonville. Main Street heads north into the downtown area as US 25 Business; the road also continues south as NC 225 (Greenville Highway). US 176 and US 25 Bus. head east concurrently along Spartanburg Highway, a four-lane highway with a center turn lane that heads through a commercial area and crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway's W Line. The highway leaves Hendersonville and heads southeast through the town of East Flat Rock. US 25 Bus. reaches its southern terminus at US 176's diamond interchange with US 25\\\\. US 176 reduces to two lanes and continues along a curvaceous path through the Blue Ridge Mountains, crossing the Green River. The road crosses the Henderson-Polk county line into the city of Saluda. US 176 and the railroad separate temporarily east of Saluda as they descend through the narrow valley of the North Pacolet River, with the railroad descending the inactive Saluda Grade, once the steepest standard gauge Class I railroad grade in the country. At the opening of the North Pacolet River valley, US 176 follows Trade Street through the town of Tryon, where the highway meets the western end of NC 108 (Lynn Road). Southeast of Tryon, the U.S. Highway enters South Carolina, where it clips the northeastern corner of Greenville County. US 176 continues into Spartanburg County as Asheville Highway. In the town of Landrum, US 176 follows Howard Avenue and intersects SC 14 (Rutherford Street). The highway continues southeast across the South Pacolet River and through Campobello, the site of the highway's junctions with SC 11 (Pine Street) and SC 357 (Holly Springs Road). US 176 passes through the hamlet of Gramling before passing through the town of Inman, where the highway expands to four lanes with intermittent center turn lane and intersects SC 292, which heads north as Main Street and south as Lyman Road. US 176 expands to a four-lane divided highway just west of its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-26. On the northern edge of the unincorporated community of Southern Shops, the highway has a partial directional interchange with SC 56, which continues straight as Asheville Highway into Spartanburg while US 176 follows Pine Street. There is no access from northbound SC 56 to eastbound US 176\\\\. Just east of the SC 56 interchange, US 176 has a diamond interchange with I-85. At Upper Valley Falls Road, the U.S. Highway becomes a freeway between Southern Shops to the south and Valley Falls to the north. US 176 has a diamond interchange with Valley Falls Road and a partial cloverleaf interchange with East Campus Boulevard; both roads provide access to the University of South Carolina Upstate. Just east of East Campus Boulevard is US 176's partial cloverleaf interchange with I-85 Business; there is no access to East Campus Boulevard from the ramp from southbound I-85 Business to westbound US 176. US 176 continues east concurrent with I-585, with two-way frontage roads on both sides of the freeway. Just east of I-85 Business, there are ramps from eastbound US 176 and to westbound US 176 with the frontage roads. The frontage roads connect with California Avenue, which is accessed from the other direction by a half-diamond interchange after that street's overpass. East of the California Avenue interchange, US 176 has a pair of diamond interchanges with SC 9 and US 221 as the U.S. Highway enters the city of Spartanburg. SC 9 heads north from the three-ramp partial diamond interchange as Boiling Springs Road; the roadway continues south as Church Street as SC 9 joins US 176 in a concurrency. The movement from SC 9 to westbound US 176 is made via California Avenue. The interchange with US 221 (Whitney Road) is a diamond interchange; there, I-585 reaches its southern terminus and US 176 continues as a six-lane divided highway through a commercial area. US 176 and SC 9 pass the campus of Wofford College, including Gibbs Stadium and Benjamin Johnson Arena, and the headquarters of the Southern Conference, of which Wofford is a part, and crosses Norfolk Southern Railway's Charlotte District. Southeast of the railroad, US 176 and SC 9 meet the eastern end of SC 296 (Daniel Morgan Avenue), pass along the west side of Converse College, and intersect US 29 (St. John Street) on the east side of downtown Spartanburg. =Spartanburg to Columbia= US 176 and SC 9 head east out of Spartanburg as a four-lane highway with center turn lane. Just west of the town of Pacolet, the road passes under the W Line, expands to a divided highway, and meets the eastern end of SC 295 (Southport Road). East of SC 295, SC 9 splits east as Pine Street to pass through Pacolet while US 176 bypasses the town to the south. The U.S. Highway intersects SC 150 (Glenn Springs Road) before entering Union County, where the highway's name becomes Furman L. Fendley Highway. US 176 bypasses Jonesville while SC 9 passes directly through; east of the town, SC 9 veers east while SC 18 begins to parallel US 176 southeast to Union. US 176 intersects SC 215 (Buffalo West Springs Highway) and runs concurrently with the state highway on a four-lane road with center turn lane along the west side of town. The highways run concurrently with SC 49 between Rice Avenue, which SC 49 uses to bypass downtown Union, and Main Street. As US 176 and SC 215 curve east, they intersect SC 496 (Industrial Park Road/Union Boulevard), which is signed as SC 49 Truck. The bypass ends on the southern edge of town at the southern terminus of SC 18 (Pinckney Street). SC 215 heads east on Beltline Road while US 176 turns south onto Whitmire Highway. US 176 continues south as a two-lane road, enters Sumter National Forest, and crosses the Tyger River. At the southern end of Union County, the U.S. Highway meets SC 72 and SC 121 (Carlisle Whitmire Highway) at a directional intersection. The three highways run concurrently on a four-lane undivided highway and cross the Enoree River into Newberry County and the town of Whitmire. There, SC 72 continues to the center of town on Union Street while US 176 and SC 121 follow Watson Street along the edge of town and head south as a two-lane road that crosses Duncan Creek. At Indian Creek, the U.S. Highway and state highway diverge southeasterly and southerly, respectively, shortly before US 176 exits the national forest at its junction with SC 34. US 176 has an oblique junction with SC 219 west of Pomaria, SC 773 within the town, and SC 202 east of the town. The highway meets the western end of SC 213 (Parr Road) west of the town of Peak before entering Richland County. US 176 gradually edges closer to I-26 before meeting the Interstate at a partial cloverleaf interchange on the edge of the suburban area surrounding Columbia. The highway meets US 76 (Dutch Fork Road) at an oblique intersection and the two U.S. Highways head east together into the town of Irmo. The highways expand to a four-lane road with center turn lane and diverge at their partial cloverleaf interchange with I-26 (James F. Byrnes Expressway), at which US 76 joins the Interstate to head into Columbia. US 176 drops to two lanes and continues southeast into the town of St. Andrews, where the highway has an oblique junction with SC 60 (Lake Murray Boulevard) just west of Harbison State Forest. The highway expands to a four- lane road with center turn lane, passes by the Broad River Correctional Institution, and passes through the downtown area of St. Andrews, then has a diamond interchange with I-20. US 176 enters the city of Columbia, passes the Dutch Square mall, and curves east to cross the Broad River, the Columbia Canal, and Norfolk Southern's W Line on the Broad River Bridge. US 176 continues on the east side of the river as River Drive. At its junction with Clement Avenue and SC 16 (Sunset Drive), River Drive veers southeast and becomes two lanes. US 176 crosses over a CSX rail line before reaching an oblique intersection with Main Street, where the highway begins a lengthy concurrency with US 21 and US 321. The highways follow four-lane Main Street to the Elmwood Park Historic District, where the highways gain a fourth route, US 76, when they turn west onto six-lane divided Elmwood Avenue at the northern edge of downtown Columbia. One block to the west, the four U.S. Highways meet the western end of SC 48 (Assembly Street). A few blocks further to the west, Elmwood Avenue becomes a freeway carrying I-126 and US 76 west out of downtown Columbia; US 176, US 21, and US 321 exit the freeway at a full Y interchange onto six-lane divided Huger Street. South of another crossing of the W Line, the highways intersect the westbound and eastbound directions of SC 12 at Taylor Street and Hampton Street, respectively. South of their intersection with US 1 and US 378 (Gervais Street), US 176, US 21, and US 321 pass two blocks west of the Columbia Amtrak station before they reach Blossom Street, which carries US 21 Connector and US 76 Connector east through the University of South Carolina campus. The U.S. Highways follow four-lane divided Blossom Street west across the Congaree River out of the city of Columbia into Lexington County. =Columbia to Goose Creek= US 176, US 21, and US 321 follow Knox Abbott Drive, a four-lane street with center turn lane, west through the city of Cayce, where they intersect SC 2 (State Street) and SC 35 (12th Street). The highways briefly enter the city of West Columbia when they veer southwest onto Charleston Highway. The U.S. Highways pass under a rail line and have an oblique junction with SC 302 (Edmund Road) before re- entering Cayce. US 176, US 21, and US 321 become a divided highway as they pass historic Columbia Speedway, pass over another rail line, and meet the southern end of SC 2 (Frink Street) at a directional intersection that lacks a connection from the south-heading U.S. Highways to northbound SC 2. The U.S. Highways continue south as a four-lane road plus center turn lane that crosses a pair of creeks before expanding to a six-lane divided highway and meeting I-26 at a partial cloverleaf interchange. Just south of that interchange, US 176, US 21, and US 321 meet ramps from the southern terminus of I-77 (Veterans Memorial Freeway) opposite Fish Hatchery Road. The three U.S. Highways reduce to four lanes and cross over CSX's Columbia Subdivision east of the town of Pine Ridge. US 321 continues south toward Gaston and Swansea while US 176 and US 21 head southeast along Charleston Highway, which drops to two lanes. The two U.S. Highways meet I-26 at a partial cloverleaf interchange and briefly parallel the Interstate as they enter Calhoun County, where the highway is known as Old State Road. The highways diverge at Sandy Run, where US 21 heads south on Columbia Road toward Orangeburg and US 176 continues on Old State Road. West of St. Matthews, the U.S. highway runs concurrently with SC 6 between Caw Caw Road and Bridge Street. US 176 intersects US 601 (St. Matthews Road) and crosses over Norfolk Southern's SC Line south of the county seat of Calhoun County. The highway intersects SC 33 (Cameron Road) in the town of Cameron before leaving Calhoun County. Shortly after entering Orangeburg County, US 176 intersects US 301 (Five Chop Road) just west of the latter highway's junction with SC 47. The highway intersects SC 210 (Vance Road) at the crossroads of Providence northwest of the U.S. Highway's diamond interchange with I-95. At Wells, US 176 has a five-way intersection with US 15 (Bass Drive) and SC 45 (Branchdale Highway). The highway meets the eastern end of SC 314 (Bunch Ford Road) west of the town of Holly Hill and SC 310 (Camden Road) just inside the town limits. In the center of town, US 176 has a pair of intersections with SC 453, Eutaw Road and Gardner Boulevard, on either side of a grade crossing of CSX's Charleston Subdivision. US 176 enters Berkeley County by crossing the Dean Swamp, a tributary of the Four Hole Swamp. The U.S. Highway, which is named State Road, intersects SC 27 (Old Gilliard Road) and SC 311 shortly after entering the highway. US 176 heads southeast through a mixture of swamp and forest with occasional farmland before entering the suburban area around Charleston at its junction with US 17 Alternate (Live Oak Drive) on the edge of the city of Goose Creek. The highway continues as St. James Avenue, a four-lane road with center turn lane. US 176 expands to six lanes shortly before reaching its eastern terminus at an oblique intersection with US 52 (Goose Creek Boulevard). There is no direct access from eastbound US 176 to northbound US 52; that movement is made via Thomason Boulevard a few blocks to the northwest. Major intersections Special routes =Spartanburg alternate route= U.S. Route 176 Alternate (US 176 Alt) was established around 1938 after mainline US 176 was rerouted onto Asheville Highway and Church Street; the alternate route continued along the old route via Magnolia, Howard and Main Streets. In 1948, it was downgraded secondary road S-42-2. Some map inserts of the time list it as \\"Optional US 176.\\" =Union business loop= U.S. Route 176 Business (US 176 Bus) was a business loop through downtown Union, via Thompson Boulevard and Pinckney Street. It was established around 1956, when the Duncan Bypass was completed and mainline US 176 was realigned along it. Around 1990, US 176 Bus was decommissioned and replaced by an extension of SC 18. = Union connector = U.S. Route 176 Connector (US 176 Conn) is a hidden connector route in Union, it officially appearing in county and state maps, while highway signage identify it as \\"TO\\" US 176\\\\. This four-lane with turning median highway connects between US 176 and SC 18, along Connector Road. It was created when US 176 was rerouted onto new alignment north of Union, with the elimination of US 176 Business and extension of SC 18; Connector Road was originally part of Duncan Bypass, built around 1956.

Based on the Joyce Carol Oates novel Foxfire: Confessions of a Girl Gang, it examines the coming of age of four high school girls who meet up with a mysterious and beautiful drifter. Plot Maddie Wirtz is a high school senior living in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon. Her plans to coast through her last school year before college are waylaid when she meets another teenage girl, \\"Legs,\\" a drifter who takes shelter from the rain inside Maddie's school. The same day she meets them, Legs convinces Maddie and fellow students Rita Faldes and Violet Kahn to confront Mr. Buttinger, a teacher who's been sexually harassing Rita and Violet. Maddie, Rita, and Violet flee after the confrontation turns violent, witnessed by student Goldie Goldman, who flees with them. Later, Legs finds Maddie at her house from the address in a notebook Maddie dropped in Mr. Buttinger's classroom. Legs spends the night at Maddie's house and bonds with her further in the morning before school. At school, Maddie, Rita, Violet, and Goldie are suspended for the confrontation of Mr. Buttinger, despite their explanation of what happened. After getting kicked out of school, the girls go to an abandoned house where Maddie suggested Legs stay, finding Legs there. All five girls quickly form a close bond, with the abandoned house as their \\"headquarters\\" and engaging in further acts of rebellion, such as breaking into the school to retrieve part of Maddie's art school application (which the principal refused to let her get before she got kicked out) and Legs tattooing a flame on all of them. Legs and Maddie also learn Goldie's father physically abuses her. Everything culminates when the girls crash a car stolen from a group of boys who were about to rape Maddie in \\"revenge\\" for what happened to Mr. Buttinger. Though not seriously injured, the girls go on trial for stealing the car, with the boys and one of their girlfriends, Cindy, lying about the events leading up to it. Legs is sent to a juvenile prison and the group flounders without her, with Goldie starting to use heroin. Eventually, Cindy, feeling guilty, tells the judge the truth, leading to Legs' release. The girls' reunion is tempered by Legs learning of Goldie's addiction; Maddie has taken her to the abandoned house to detox. In an effort to help her, Legs leads Maddie, Rita, and Violet to Goldie's house to demand $10,000 from her parents to send Goldie to rehab. The situation escalates when Goldie's father refuses and Legs, holding him at gunpoint, forces the others to take him to the abandoned house. He is tied to a chair while the girls try to think of what to do next, and the tension rises as Legs begins taking her own paternal frustrations out on him. In the midst of the chaos, Rita accidentally shoots Goldie's father in the shoulder. Panic ensues and the girls resolve to get Goldie's father to the hospital. When Goldie, Rita, and Violet leave with Goldie's father, Maddie realizes Legs is missing. She finds Legs walking along the bridge, looking for a ride to another town. Both girls make proposals, Maddie for Legs to stay with her and the others and Legs for Maddie to join her on the road. Sad but resolute, the two eventually go their separate ways. Legs gets a truck to stop and boards as Maddie watches it disappear. In a voice-over, it's revealed that Maddie reunited with her boyfriend, finished high school, and went on to attend art school in New York City. She travels the world, always stopping at airports and bus stops along the way. Although none of the group ever see Legs again, they still get together once in a while and strengthen their bond over the past.

Sandals can also have a heel. While the distinction between sandals and other types of footwear can sometimes be blurry (as in the case of huaraches‚Äîthe woven leather footwear seen in Mexico, and peep-toe pumps), the common understanding is that a sandal leaves all or most of the foot exposed. People may choose to wear sandals for several reasons, among them comfort in warm weather, economy (sandals tend to require less material than shoes and are usually easier to construct), and as a fashion choice. Usually, people wear sandals in warmer climates or during warmer parts of the year in order to keep their feet cool and dry. The risk of developing athlete's foot is lower than with enclosed shoes, and the wearing of sandals may be part of the treatment regimen for such an infection.  History  Esparto sandals from the 6th or 5th millennium BC found in Spain. Pair of ancient leather sandals from Egypt. Girl wearing sandals held to the feet by both thong and straps. The oldest known sandals (and the oldest known footwear of any type) were discovered in Fort Rock Cave in the U.S. state of Oregon; radiocarbon dating of the sagebrush bark from which they were woven indicates an age of at least 10,000 years. The word is of Greek origin - : s√°ndalon. The ancient Greeks distinguished between: * : p√°xeia (Latinized as '; plural baxeae), a sandal made of willow leaves, twigs, or fibres worn by comic actors and philosophers; and * : k√≥thornos (Latinized as cothurnus), a boot sandal that rose above the middle of the leg, worn principally by tragic actors, horsemen, hunters, and by men of rank and authority. The sole of the cothurnus was sometimes made much thicker than usual by the insertion of slices of cork, so as to add to the stature of the wearer.Serv. in Virg. Ed. II. cc. (cited by Yates) The ancient Egyptians wore sandals made of palm tree- leaves and papyrus.Wilkinson, Manners and Customs vol. iii. p. 336. (cited by Yates) They are sometimes observable on the feet of Egyptian statues and in reliefs, being carried by sandal-bearers. According to Herodotus, sandals of papyrus were a part of the required and characteristic dress of the Egyptian priests. In Ancient Greece sandals were the most common type of footwear that women wore and spent most of their time at home. The Greek sandals featured a multitude of straps with which they securely fastened to the foot. The top of the sandals were usually of colored leather. The soles were made of cattle skin, of even better quality and made up of several layers. In Ancient Rome residents used to carve their boots and sandals with elaborate designs. In Ancient Levant sandals (\\"Biblical sandals\\") were made from non-processed leather and dry grass, and had strings or ropes made of simple, cheap materials. Though, sometimes golden or silver beads and even gems were added. In his autobiography Edward Carpenter told how sandals came to be made in England:  Construction  Anatomy of a sandal A sandal may have a sole made from rubber, leather, wood, tatami or rope. It may be held to the foot by a narrow thong that generally passes between the first and second toe, or by a strap or lace, variously called a latchet, sabot strap or sandal, that passes over the arch of the foot or around the ankle. A sandal may or may not have a heel (either low or high) or heel strap.  Variants  * Caligae, a heavy- soled classical Roman military shoe or sandal for marching, worn by all ranks up to and including centurion * Clog can be formed as a heavy sandal, having a thick, typically wooden sole. * Crochet sandals * Fisherman sandal is a type of T-bar sandal originally for men and boys. The toes are enclosed by a number of leather bands interwoven with the central length-wise strap that lies along the instep. An adjustable cross strap or bar is fastened with a buckle. The heel may be fully enclosed or secured by a single strap joined to the cross strap. The style appears to have originated in France. * Flip-flops are typically cheap and suitable for beach, pool, or locker room wear * geta, a classical Japanese form of elevated thong, traditionally of cryptomeria wood; the crosspiece is referred to as a ha, which translates to tooth * Grecian sandal, sandals from Greece and Salento (Italy), a (generally flat or low) sole attached to the foot by interlaced straps crossing the toes and instep, and fastening around the ankle. A similar style is sometimes called gladiator sandal * High-heeled sandal, a type of sandal with an elevated heel. They allow the wearer to have an open shoe while being less casual or more formal, depending on the style of the sandal. * Hiking and trekking sandals are designed for hiking or trekking in hot and tropical climates, usually using robust rubber outsole, suitable for any terrain, and softer EVA or Super EVA foam insole. These sandals are usually shaped to support the arched contour of the foot. The straps are usually made of polyester or nylon webbing for quick drying after exposure to water and to minimize perspiration. Also suitable for many other adventure sports and activities where quick drying and reduced perspiration is required, including rafting, traveling, paragliding, skydiving. * Ho Chi Minh sandals is one name for a homemade or cottage industry footwear, the soles cut from an old automobile tire and the straps cut from an inner tube. Made and worn in many countries, they became wider known in the US as worn by the rural people of Indochina during the Vietnam War, leading to the name. * Huarache, a Mexican sandal,Huaraches: Mexican sandals from Huaraches.com with sole made of a tire tread, or huarache (running shoe), a flat sandal used by minimalist runners. * Jelly sandals or jelly shoes were originally a version of the classic fisherman sandal made in PVC plastic. They were invented in 1946 by Frenchman Jean Dauphant in response to a post-war leather shortage. Later designs featured translucent soft plastic in bright colours; hence the later name of jelly sandals or jellies. Recently, a whole range of styles have been produced in this material, mainly for women and girls, but the classic unisex design remains popular. * JesuslatschenDDR Museum: Sandals in GDR so called Jesuslatschen * Jipsin, a traditional Korean sandal made of straw *Ojota, an extremely durable Peruvian sandal made of recycled tires that is traditionally worn in the Andes by Quechua people. * Paduka are the ancient (as old as the time of the Ramayana) Indian toe-knob sandals.

They are sold primarily along the Texas Gulf Coast in beach side gift shops. * T-bar sandals, primarily for children, with an enclosed heel and toe. It is fastened by a cross-wise strap or bar secured by a buckle, or more recently by Velcro. A length-wise strap extends from the vamp and joins the cross-strap over the arch of the foot to form a T shape. A common variant has two cross-straps. The toe is often pierced with a pattern of holes or slots. The sole is low-heeled and usually of crepe rubber, stitched-down to the upper. First seen in Europe and America in the early 20th century, by the 1950s they were very common for boys and girls up to their teens, but are now mainly worn by much younger children.

A diazotroph is a microorganism that is able to grow without external sources of fixed nitrogen. Examples of organisms that do this are rhizobia and Frankia (in symbiosis) and Azospirillum. All diazotrophs contain iron-molybdenum or -vanadium nitrogenase systems. Two of the most studied systems are those of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Azotobacter vinelandii. These systems are used because of their genetic tractability and their fast growth. Etymology The word diazotroph is derived from the words diazo (\\"di\\" = two + \\"azo\\" = nitrogen) meaning \\"dinitrogen (N2)\\" and troph meaning \\"pertaining to food or nourishment\\", in summary dinitrogen utilizing. The word azote means nitrogen in French and was named by French chemist and biologist Antoine Lavoisier, who saw it as the part of air which cannot sustain life. Types of diazotrophs Diazotrophs are scattered across Bacteria taxonomic groups (as well as a couple of Archaea). Even within a species that can fix nitrogen there may be strains that do not. Fixation is shut off when other sources of nitrogen are available, and, for many species, when oxygen is at high partial pressure. Bacteria have different ways of dealing with the debilitating effects of oxygen on nitrogenases, listed below. =Free-living diazotrophs= * Anaerobes‚Äîthese are obligate anaerobes that cannot tolerate oxygen even if they are not fixing nitrogen. They live in habitats low in oxygen, such as soils and decaying vegetable matter. Clostridium is an example. Sulphate-reducing bacteria are important in ocean sediments (e.g. Desulfovibrio), and some Archean methanogens, like Methanococcus, fix nitrogen in muds, animal intestines and anoxic soils. * Facultative anaerobes‚Äîthese species can grow either with or without oxygen, but they only fix nitrogen anaerobically. Often, they respire oxygen as rapidly as it is supplied, keeping the amount of free oxygen low. Examples include Klebsiella pneumoniae, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Bacillus macerans, and Escherichia intermedia. * Aerobes‚Äîthese species require oxygen to grow, yet their nitrogenase is still debilitated if exposed to oxygen. Azotobacter vinelandii is the most studied of these organisms. It uses very high respiration rates, and protective compounds, to prevent oxygen damage. Many other species also reduce the oxygen levels in this way, but with lower respiration rates and lower oxygen tolerance. * Oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (cyanobacteria) generate oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, yet some are able to fix nitrogen as well. These are colonial bacteria that have specialized cells (heterocysts) that lack the oxygen generating steps of photosynthesis. Examples are Anabaena cylindrica and Nostoc commune. Other cyanobacteria lack heterocysts and can fix nitrogen only in low light and oxygen levels (e.g. Plectonema). Some cyanobacteria, including the highly abundant marine taxa Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus do not fix nitrogen, whilst other marine cyanobacteria, such as Trichodesmium and Cyanothece, are major contributors to oceanic nitrogen fixation. * Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria do not generate oxygen during photosynthesis, having only a single photosystem which cannot split water. Nitrogenase is expressed under nitrogen limitation. Normally, the expression is regulated via negative feedback from the produced ammonium ion but in the absence of N2, the product is not formed, and the by-product H2 continues unabated [Biohydrogen]. Example species: Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Rhodobacter capsulatus.Blankenship RE, Madigan MT & Bauer CE (1995). Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Dordrecht, The Netherlands, Kluwer Academic. =Symbiotic diazotrophs= * Rhizobia‚Äîthese are the species that associate with legumes, plants of the family Fabaceae. Oxygen is bound to leghemoglobin in the root nodules that house the bacterial symbionts, and supplied at a rate that will not harm the nitrogenase. * Frankias‚Äîmuch less is known about these 'actinorhizal' nitrogen fixers. The bacteria also infect the roots leading to the formation of nodules. Actinorhizal nodules consist of several lobes, each lobe has a similar structure as a lateral root. Frankia is able to colonize in the cortical tissue of nodules where it fixes nitrogen. Actinorhizal plants and Frankias also produce haemoglobins, but their role is less well established than for rhizobia. Although at first it appeared that they inhabit sets of unrelated plants (alders, Australian pines, California lilac, bog myrtle, bitterbrush, Dryas), revisions to the phylogeny of angiosperms show a close relatedness of these species and the legumes. These footnotes suggest the ontogeny of these replicates rather than the phylogeny. In other words, an ancient gene (from before the angiosperms and gymnosperms diverged) that is unused in most species was reawakened and reused in these species. * Cyanobacteria‚Äîthere are also symbiotic cyanobacteria. Some associate with fungi as lichens, with liverworts, with a fern, and with a cycad. These do not form nodules (indeed most of the plants do not have roots). Heterocysts exclude the oxygen, as discussed above. The fern association is important agriculturally: the water fern Azolla harbouring Anabaena is an important green manure for rice culture. * Association with animals‚Äîalthough diazotrophs have been found in many animal guts, there is usually sufficient ammonia present to suppress nitrogen fixation. Termites on a low nitrogen diet allow for some fixation, but the contribution to the termite's nitrogen supply is negligible. Shipworms may be the only species that derive significant benefit from their gut symbionts. Importance In terms of generating nitrogen available to all organisms, the symbiotic associations greatly exceed the free-living species with the exception of cyanobacteria.

It currently runs for 1,074 miles (1,728 km) from Hilton Head Island, South Carolina to Wickes, Arkansas at U.S. Route 71/U.S. Route 59. It is longer than its parent highway, US 78. US 278 passes through the states of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas. This highway passes through the cities and towns of Augusta, Covington, Atlanta, Powder Springs, Hiram, Dallas, Rockmart, and Cedartown, Georgia; Gadsden and Cullman, Alabama; Tupelo, Oxford, and Greenville, Mississippi; and Monticello and Hope, Arkansas. It also passes through the Savannah River Site, of the Department of Energy in South Carolina, and crosses the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway in eastern Mississippi. U.S. 278 passes through the places where many colleges, universities, and technical institutes are located, including the Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia State University, and many others in Atlanta, Georgia; the University of South Carolina - Beaufort (Bluffton), the Augusta University; the University of Mississippi, Delta State University, and the University of Arkansas at Monticello. Route description =Arkansas= US 278 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 59/U.S. Route 71 in the town of Wickes in southwestern Arkansas. From Wickes, US 278 continues eastward near Gillham Lake to an overlap with US 70 through Dierks. Continuing south, US 278 passes the Ebenezer Campground and has an officially designated exception with Highway 26 of at Center Point very near the Adam Boyd House. Further south the route serves as the northern terminus of Highway 355 near the Russey-Murray House and it continues south to enter Nashville. The route begins an overlap with U.S. Route 371 and later Highway 27 upon entering Nashville, where it passes the Howard County Courthouse, the Nashville Post Office, the Nashville Commercial Historic District, the First Presbyterian Church, and the Nashville American Legion Building, all properties on the National Register of Historic Places. Entering Hempstead County, the highway winds through rural areas to Ozan and the Washington Confederate Monument in Washington, before meeting US 278 Business (US 278B) outside Hope. The highway crosses over Interstate 30 shortly after entering the city limits and continues along Bill Clinton Drive, forming a concurrency with Highway 29 and Highway 32. US 278/AR 29/AR 32 intersect US 67 in east Hope. South of this junction AR 29 splits and continues south as Bill Clinton Drive with US 278/AR 32 continuing southeast. Further along this route, Highway 32 turns southeast to Willisville and US 278 runs toward Camden. The route intersects Highway 53 in rural Nevada County, has an officially designated exception with US 371 in Rosston, and has a junction with Highway 57 upon entering Ouachita County. Highway 278 passes the Two Bayou Methodist Church and Cemetery and the Bragg House before entering Camden. In the city, US 278 intersects Highway 24 before it meets US 278B and US 79B prior to overlapping US 79. Highway 278 breaks from US 79 near Harrell Field shortly before entering East Camden. Highway 278 continues into Calhoun County past the Dunn House into Hampton, where it passes the Calhoun County Courthouse prior to a junction with US 371. The east edge of town brings an intersection with Highway 274 as US 278 continues to Harrell and Highway 160 before entering Bradley County. Aside from Banks, where US 278 has a junction with Highway 275, the route runs through rural country until Warren, where US 278 almost entirely bypasses the city to the south while US 278B runs downtown, including a brief overlap with US 63B. US 278 has an intersection with US 63/AR 8 along the southern edge of Warren before serving as the eastern terminus for US 278B. Further east the highway intersects Highway 172 which gives access to the Warren Prairie Natural Area just east of the Drew County line. The route continues to Monticello to McGehee, where it meets U.S. Route 65. US 278 overlaps US 65 southward for until they separate in Lake Village. There, US 65 splits off and US 278 overlaps U.S. Route 82 east to the Mississippi River, where US 82 and US 278 cross into Mississippi. Long-term plans are to move US 278 to the Charles W. Dean Bridge,Minutes of the Meeting of the Arkansas State Highway Commission, August 6, 1997 (p. 963): \\"WHEREAS, the State of Mississippi has expressed interest in extending U. S. 278, which presently ends at Tupelo, westward into Arkansas on a temporary location, utilizing the U. S. 82 river crossing, with an ultimate alignment over the future Great River Bridge and connecting roadways;\\" which is part of the proposed extension of Interstate 69. =Mississippi= US 49 and US 61 run with US 278 near Clarksdale, MS US 82 and US 278 go through Greenville to Leland, where US 278 separates from US 82 at U.S. Route 61. US 278 then joins US 61 northward through Cleveland before splitting in Clarksdale. East of Clarksdale, it overlaps Mississippi Highway 6 through Batesville, Oxford, and Pontotoc before reaching Tupelo. At Tupelo, MS 6 separates from US 278 while US 278 overlaps U.S. Route 45 south to New Wren. From New Wren, US 278 continues east through Amory before entering Alabama. =Alabama= U.S. 278 enters Alabama between Greenwood Springs, Mississippi, and Sulligent, Alabama. As in Georgia, this and all U.S routes are partnered with state routes; however, there are few instances throughout the state where the state route number is posted. From the Mississippi state line to Guin, U.S. 278 is paired with State Route 118. From Hamilton to the Georgia state line, U.S. 278 is paired with State Route 74. U.S. 278 junctions U.S. Route 431 at Gadsden. The two routes overlap until they split at Attalla. After a reconfiguration of 3rd St SW at Main Ave SW to connect directly with 4th St SW in Cullman, U.S. 278 no longer briefly overlaps U.S. Route 31 for a block. U.S. 278 overlaps U.S. Route 43 between Hamilton and Guin. Prior to the completion of Corridor X (Future I-22), these two routes also overlapped U.S. Route 78 between these two towns, with East U.S. 78 travelling in the same direction as West U.S. 278. =Georgia= S.R. 12) in downtown Crawfordville, GA. In Atlanta, it (U.S. 278) runs along Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway (Bankhead Highway), North Avenue, briefly along Piedmont Road and Ponce de Leon Avenue. Outside the Perimeter, U.S. 278 runs along Covington Highway. In Lithonia, Georgia, at the intersection with Turner Hill Road (S.R. 124), U.S. 278 merges with Interstate 20 for . It leaves I-20 at exit 90, in Covington, Georgia. U.S. 278 is co- signed with a state route for its entire length in Georgia, as are all U.S. highways in Georgia. From the Alabama line into Lithia Springs, Georgia, it is co-signed with S.R. 6. From Lithia Springs through Atlanta, it is merged with U.S. Route 78/S.R. 8. In Atlanta, the federal highway merges further with other highways including S.R. 10 and U.S. Route 23 before splitting off at Ponce de Leon Ave. and East Lake Road near Decatur. In Avondale Estates, Georgia, S.R. 12 is paired with U.S. 278, all the way into Thomson, Georgia. There, the federal route merges with U.S. 78/S.R. 10 to the South Carolina line. =South Carolina= After crossing the Savannah River, U.S. 278 bypasses North Augusta, South Carolina en route to Beech Island and Johnson Crossroads. It then winds through a corner of the Savannah River Site. The route then continues onward through the towns of Allendale, Fairfax, Hampton, Varnville, Ridgeland, and Hardeeville where it meets I-95. U.S. 278 shares the route between Ridgeland and Hardeeville with U.S. 17. Prior to the construction of Exit 8 on Interstate 95 (which provides direct access to southern Beaufort County), U.S. 278 went from Ridgeland through Old House and Okatie toward Bluffton, along present-day state routes 336, 462, and 170. Upon reaching Hardeeville, the route heads eastward toward the Atlantic with major new developments lining the spine of the road from Hardeeville through Sun City and Bluffton before crossing over the bridge to Hilton Head Island. U.S. 278 ends at U.S. 278 Business on the southern portion of Hilton Head Island, just outside Sea Pines Plantation. Old U.S. 278 was routed along what is now U.S. 278 Business until 1998, when a new toll road, dubbed the Cross Island Parkway was built. U.S. 278 was routed along the new parkway. The completion of the \\"Gateway to Hilton Head\\", a direct expressway connection from the north side to the south side of the island, has caused a great amount of commercial and residential development along the road. History Until early 2005, U.S. 278 was only signed in Mississippi from the Alabama state line to U.S. Route 45 west of Amory.

US 378 connects the Central Savannah River Area in both states with the Midlands and Pee Dee regions of South Carolina. The U.S. Highway's western portion, which connects Washington and Lincolnton in Georgia and McCormick, Saluda, and Lexington in South Carolina, is mainly a rural highway. US 378 is a major suburban and urban highway through Lexington and the South Carolina state capital, Columbia. The highway has a lengthy concurrency with US 76 between Columbia and Sumter and serves as a major route between the Midlands and the Myrtle Beach area, between which the highway has a business route through Lake City. Route description US 378 has a length of in Georgia and spans in South Carolina. The U.S. Highway is a part of the National Highway System from US 178 in Saluda east to US 501 and US 701 in Conway. =Georgia= US 378 begins at an intersection on the eastern edge of the city of Washington with US 78, SR 10, and SR 17, which form the north‚Äìsouth axis of the junction, and US 78 Business, SR 47, SR 10 Business, and SR 17 Business, which head west on Robert Toombs Avenue toward the downtown area. US 378 and SR 47 head east on Lincolnton Road, also known as Joe Wheeler Highway, which starts as a four-lane divided highway but becomes two lanes a short distance east of the intersection. Shortly after the Wilkes‚ÄìLincoln county line, the highways, now part of Washington Highway, meet the western end of SR 220, a C-shaped route through southern Lincoln County. US 378 and SR 47 gradually curve north and enter the city of Lincolnton as Washington Street. SR 47 splits east from the U.S. Highway and SR 43 begins to run concurrently with US 378 at their intersection with Elm Street. The highways pass along the west side of downtown Lincolnton and curve northeast, meeting the southern end of SR 79 (Goshen Street) before leaving the city. US 378 and SR 43 continue northeast on McCormick Highway, which meets the northern end of SR 43 Connector (Old Petersburg Road) a short distance east of the city limits at Wright's Crossing. The highways cross the Soap Creek branch of the Savannah River reservoir known as Clarks Hill Lake in Georgia and Lake Strom Thurmond in South Carolina. =South Carolina= State line to Saluda US 378 and SR 43 meet the eastern end of SR 220 just west of Elijah Clark State Park. SR 43 reaches its northern terminus at the state line at the thalweg of the Savannah River in the center of the lake crossing. US 378 enters Sumter National Forest and crosses the Little River branch of the lake, on the east side of which is Baker Creek State Park. The highway continues to the town of McCormick, through which the highway follows Gold Street. US 378 intersects SC 28 (Mine Street) on the west side of downtown; US 221 leaves its concurrency with SC 28 coming from Augusta and joins US 378 through the downtown area. The U.S. Highways have a grade crossing of CSX's McCormick Subdivision and diverge on the east side of town, with US 221 heading northeast as Greenwood Highway. US 378 leaves McCormick, passes McCormick County Airport, and forms the southern boundary of Sumter National Forest east of the town. East of Liberty Hill, where the highway fully enters the national forest, the road crosses the McCormick‚ÄìEdgefield county line. US 378 again forms the southern boundary of Sumter National Forest from its intersection with SC 67 (Callison Highway). The highway also intersects US 25 and SC 430 (Meeting Street Road) while passing along the northern tier of Edgefield County. US 378 leaves the national forest shortly after entering Saluda County. The highway enters the town of Saluda along Church Street and intersects Main Street, which carries US 178, SC 39, and SC 121. Two blocks to the east, US 378 turns north onto Jennings Street, then turns east on Travis Avenue at its junction with SC 194, which heads north on Jennings Street, and US 178 Connector, which heads west on Travis Avenue to connect with US 178. Saluda to Sumter US 378 crosses the Little Saluda River and leaves Saluda along Columbia Highway. After crossing Clouds Creek, the highway meets SC 391 (Prosperity Highway/Summerland Highway) at a roundabout and enters Lexington County. East of the Hollow Creek and Horse Creek branches of Lake Murray, US 378 expands to a four-lane road with center turn lane. The highway becomes concurrent with US 1 (Main Street) on the western edge of the town of Lexington. After US 1 splits southeast to head to the center of town, US 378 continues on Columbia Avenue, then has a brief concurrency with SC 6 along Lake Drive. The U.S. Highway exits the town along Sunset Boulevard. US 378 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-20 and a single-point urban interchange with I-26 before entering the city of West Columbia. The highway meets the northern ends of SC 35 (12th Street) and SC 12 Connector (9th Street), which provides access to westbound SC 12. East of the connector route, US 378 becomes a four-lane undivided highway. The highway has a partial interchange with SC 12 (Jarvis Klapman Boulevard) that only allows access to and from Columbia. US 378 meets US 1 (Meeting Street) and the northern end of SC 2 (State Street) just before the two U.S. Highways cross the Congaree River on the four-lane Gervais Street Bridge into Richland County and the city of Columbia. The highways follow four-lane divided Gervais Street past EdVenture and the South Carolina State Museum and intersect Huger Street, which carries US 21, US 176, and US 321. US 378 and US 1 cross over Norfolk Southern Railway's W Line and pass through the Congaree Vista neighborhood. At the intersection with SC 48 (Assembly Street), the highways pass between the South Carolina State House and Capitol Center. US 378 begins its long concurrency with US 76 when the latter highway turns onto Gervais Street from Bull Street. The three U.S. Highways cross over Norfolk Southern's Columbia District rail line before reaching Millwood Avenue, where US 1 turns north and US 378 and US 76 turn south. Gervais Street continues east as an unnumbered street several blocks through a residential area before reaching its eastern terminus. US 378 and US 76 follow Millwood Avenue, a four-lane street with center turn lane, southeast to an oblique intersection with Devine Street. Devine Street carries US 21 Connector and US 76 Connector west through Five Points and the University of South Carolina campus. The U.S. Highways continue east along Devine Street to their intersection with SC 16 (Beltline Boulevard), where the road expands to six lanes. A short distance to the east, US 378 and US 76 have an intersection with SC 760 (Fort Jackson Boulevard), which heads east toward the namesake military installation, and a second US 76 Connector that follows Cross Hill Road north to SC 16. East of their intersection with a third US 76 Connector, which heads east on Wildcat Road and west on Rosewood Drive, the U.S. Highways continue as Garners Ferry Road. US 378 and US 76 meet the western end of SC 262 (Leesburg Road) just west of the U.S. Highways' and state highway's partial cloverleaf interchanges with I-77 (Veterans Memorial Freeway). Southeast of I-77, the road becomes a four-lane divided highway, leaves the city of Columbia, and meet the northern end of SC 768 (Pineview Road). US 378 and US 76 enter a rural area and pass through Horrell Hill, where they meet the northern end of SC 769 (Congaree Road), pass McEntire Joint National Guard Base, and have a junction with the western end of SC 764 (Old Eastover Road). The U.S. Highways have a diamond interchange with US 601 (McCords Ferry Road) and an intersection with SC 263 (Vanbloken Road) north of Eastover before they cross the Wateree River into Sumter County. Sumter to Conway East of the extensive swamp surrounding the Wateree River, US 378 and US 76 pass south of the village of Stateburg and intersect SC 261 (Kings Highway). East of SC 441, Peach Orchard Road/Patriot Parkway), the U.S. Highways enter the city of Sumter, through the western portion of which they follow Broad Street. US 378 and US 76 have a trumpet interchange with Shaw Drive, the main access to Shaw Air Force Base, and follow the southern boundary of the military reservation. East of the base, the highways pass through a commercial area and meet the northern end of SC 120 (Alice Drive) just west of where Broad Street continues along US 76 Business while the U.S. Highways continue along the Robert E. Graham Freeway. Just east of the business route, US 378 and US 76 have a half-diamond interchange with US 521 (Camden Highway) allowing access with US 521 to and from the east; the other movements are made via US 76 Business and Jefferson Road. A pair of frontage roads parallels the freeway; the U.S. Highways have right-in/right-out interchanges with the frontage roads just west of the overpass of US 15 (Main Street). The frontage roads end at the freeway's diamond interchange with US 401. US 378 and US 76 cross a rail spur before highways exit the city of Sumter and the frontage roads reappear along the freeway. The U.S. Highways diverge at their partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern end of US 76 Business (Liberty Street); US 76 heads east as Florence Highway while US 378 continues southeast along the freeway to East Sumter, where it ends at the eastern terminus of SC 763 (Myrtle Beach Highway). US 378 continues east as Myrtle Beach Highway, a four-lane divided highway. The highway crosses the Black River and intersects SC 527 (Brick Church Road) at McBrides Corner. US 378 has an acute junction with SC 53 (Narrow Paved Road) and a diamond interchange with I-95 before entering Clarendon County, where the route follows Clarence Coker Highway. The highway becomes undivided as it enters the town of Turbeville. US 378 runs concurrently with US 301 along four-lane undivided Main Street, which intersects SC 58 (Gamble Street) one block north of the US 378‚ÄìUS 301 junction. The two U.S. Highways split near the northern end of town, with US 378 continuing east as a four-lane road with center turn lane. The highway enters Florence County, where its name changes to Turbeville Highway, then returns to the county line and runs atop the southern boundary of Florence County. During this stretch, the county to the south of the highway becomes Williamsburg County. Soon after US 378 fully enters Florence County, the highway intersects SC 341 (Olanta Highway). The two highways briefly run together before SC 341 continues straight concurrent with US 378 Business on Lake City's Main Street while US 378 splits northeast to bypass Lake City. North of the town, the U.S. Highway has a diamond interchange with US 52 (Ron McNair Boulevard). US 378 crosses over CSX's Charleston Subdivision before collecting the eastern end of US 378 Business (Myrtle Beach Highway). US 378 continues northeast as Myrtle Beach Highway. The highway crosses the Lynches River and curves southeast and then east through the hamlet of Hannah. SC 51 (Pamplico Highway) joins US 378 on a tangent curve at Salem and follows the U.S. Highway east to Kingsburg, where SC 51 turns south onto Kingsburg Highway and SC 41 joins the U.S. Highway as it curves northeast U.S. Highway 378 reduces to two lanes near Capitola Road in Johnsonville. and crosses the Great Pee Dee River into Marion County. The two highways curve southeast and cross over CSX's Andrews Subdivision before SC 41 splits to the north on a tangent curve. The U.S. Highway meets the southern end of SC 908 south of Brittons Neck before it curves east and crosses the Little Pee Dee River into Horry County. US 378 expands to a four-lane road with center turn lane shortly after passing Conway-Horry County Airport and enters the city of Conway as Wright Boulevard. West of downtown, the U.S. Highway has an oblique intersection with Church Street, which carries US 501 through the intersection and US 701 north of the intersection. Southbound US 701 continues south on Church Street to a ramp to 4th Avenue while northbound US 701 runs concurrently with US 378 from 4th Avenue, which heads west as US 701 toward Georgetown and east as SC 905. US 378 curves northeast, becomes 3rd Avenue, and reduces to two lanes as it enters the Conway Downtown Historic District, where it reaches its eastern terminus at US 501 Business (Main Street) next to the Old Conway County Courthouse. Future In the early part of the 21st century, the bridge crossing the Georgia‚ÄìSouth Carolina state line over the Savannah River was deemed to be \\"structurally deficient\\". It wasn't until 2014 that Alabama-based Scott Bridge Company began construction on a replacement for the bridge. It wasn't determined that the bridge was in danger of collapse; rather, the term was used in reference to a possible crack or split in the concrete of the bridge. Construction began in April 2010. However, in 2012, construction was halted due to a \\"rare chemical reaction\\", known as delayed ettringite. This condition caused the support columns of the bridge to swell up and begin splitting. It was the first time this condition was ever encountered in Georgia. It was discovered after personnel from GDOT, Scott Bridge Company, and scientists from the Georgia Institute of Technology conducted a thorough examination of the bridge and supporting structure. In Spring 2014, construction resumed, using a new method in which water cools freshly-poured concrete while it cures. As of February 24, 2015, the $36.2 million bridge project is 50 percent complete. It is scheduled to be completed in March 2017. The old bridge is scheduled to be demolished after the new one is completed. Major intersections Special routes =Sumter business loop= U.S. Route 378 Business (US 378 Bus) was established in 1961 as a renumbering of mainline US 378 through downtown Sumter, via Broad Street, Liberty Street and Myrtle Beach Boulevard. =Lake City business loop= U.S. Route 378 Business (US 378 Bus) is a business route of US 378 through Lake City, South Carolina. The highway runs from US 378 and SC 341 west of Lake City to US 378 east of Lake City. US 378 Business begins heading east from US 378 (Turbeville Highway) concurrent with SC 341 along two-lane Main Street. The two highways enter the town of Lake City just east of Lake City Memorial Park. In the center of town, US 378 Business and SC 341 intersect US 52 (Ron McNair Boulevard). One block after their grade crossing of CSX's Charleston Subdivision, the highways diverge. The main highway continues east on Main Street while the business route turns north onto Church Street. US 378 Business leaves the town limits at its crossing of Lake Swamp and reaches its eastern terminus at US 378 (Myrtle Beach Highway).

Because of the swirl-intake, the sealing surface between cylinder head and valve cover is different from other SOHC A-engines, featuring vertical curves on the manifold side of the head. Thus, those parts are not interchangeable between each other.

All 4A engines have a displacement of . The cylinder bore was enlarged from the previous 3A engines at , but the stroke remained the same as the 3A at , giving it an over-square bore/stroke ratio which favours high engine speeds. Numerous variations of the 4A design were produced, from basic SOHC 8-valve all the way to DOHC 20-valve versions. The power output also varied greatly between versions, from at 4,800 rpm in the basic California-spec 4A-C to at 6,400 rpm in the supercharged 4A-GZE. =4A, 4A-C, 4A-L, 4A-LC= The basic 4A is a SOHC inline 4 8-valve carburated engine which produces at 4800 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm, though the power and torque output figures vary between different regions of the world. in European versions, the combustion chambers were reformulated in early 1986, resulting in an increase of 2 hp ( at 5600 rpm), along with improvements in fuel economy and emissions.

The fuel injected 4A-FE is the successor of the carbureted 4A-F. It was manufactured between 1987‚Äì2001. Toyota designed this engine with fuel economy in mind. The 4A-FE is basically the same as the 4A-F (introduced in the 6th generation of Corollas), the most apparent difference being the electronic fuel injection system as noted by the E. The engine was succeeded by the 3ZZ-FE, a 1.6-liter engine with VVT-i technology. There are three generations of this engine and can be identified by the external shape of the engine. The first generation (1987‚Äì1996) featured a plate on the head which read \\"16 valve EFI\\" and fuel injectors in the head. The second generation had a higher profile cam design in the head, a cam cover with ribs throughout its length, and fuel injectors in the intake manifold runners. Mechanically, the late-model engines received MAP load sensing and redesigned pistons, intake ports, and intake manifold. The second generation engine was produced from 1992‚Äì1998 (1993‚Äì1996 in the US). The third generation (1996‚Äì2001) was released exclusively for the Asian market (Japan, Philippines, Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia) only. Although it is very similar to the second generation externally, it only has a slight difference in the top section of the intake manifold and throttle body. This last generation also has a higher additional output of compared to the second generation. * Engine displacement: * Layout: DOHC Inline-4 * Valves: 16, 4 for each cylinder * Redline: 6300 rpm * Compression ratio: 9.5:1 * Fuel Delivery System: TCCS or MPFI North American market engines: * at 5,800 rpm, and torque at 4,800 rpm European market engines: * at 6,000 rpm, and torque at 3,200 rpm Asian market engines: * at 6,000 rpm South African market engines: * at 6,000 rpm and torque at 4,400 rpm Note: power and torque specs for North America and Europe are from the 1988‚Äì1992 Corollas. The 4A-FE is different from the 4A-GE in terms of performance and power. Although both have the same displacement and are DOHC, they were optimized for different uses. The first obvious difference are the valves, the engine's intake and exhaust valves were placed 22.3¬∞ apart (compared to 50¬∞ in the G-Engines). The second is that it employed a \\"slave cam system\\", the camshafts being geared together and driven off one camshaft's sprocket (both camshafts' sprockets on the G-Engine are rotated by the timing belt). Some of the less directly visible differences were poorly shaped ports in the earlier versions, a slow burning combustion chamber with heavily shrouded valves, less aggressive camshaft profiles, ports of a small cross sectional area, a very restrictive intake manifold with long runners joined to a small displacement plenum and other changes. Even though the valve angle is closer to what is considered in some racing circles to be ideal for power (approximately 25 degrees), its other design differences and the intake which is tuned for a primary harmonic resonance at low RPM means that it has about 10% less power compared to the 4A-GE engine. This engine design improves fuel efficiency and torque, but compromises power. Power rating varied from in the US market. Late-model engines are rumored to make slightly greater power but still received a rating. ;Applications: * AT220 Avensis 1997‚Äì2000 (excluding Japan) * AT171/175 Carina 1988‚Äì1992 (Japan only) * AT190 Carina 1984‚Äì1996 (Japan only) * AT171 Carina II 1987‚Äì1992 (Europe only) * AT190 Carina E 1992‚Äì1997 (Europe only) * AT180 Celica 1989‚Äì1993 (excluding Japan) * AE92/95 Corolla 1988‚Äì1997 * AE101/104/109 Corolla 1991‚Äì2002 * AE111/114 Corolla 1995‚Äì2002 * AE101 Corolla Ceres 1992‚Äì1998 (Japan only) * AE111 Corolla Spacio 1997‚Äì2001 (Japan only) * AT175 Corona 1988‚Äì1992 (Japan only) * AT190 Corona 1992‚Äì1996 * AT210 Corona 1996‚Äì2001 * AE95 Sprinter 1989‚Äì1991 (Japan only) * AE101/104/109 Sprinter 1992‚Äì2002 (Japan only) * AE111/114 Sprinter 1995‚Äì1998 (Japan only) * AE95 Sprinter Carib 1988‚Äì1990 (Japan only) * AE111/114 Sprinter Carib 1996‚Äì2001 (Japan only) * AE101 Sprinter Marino 1992‚Äì1998 (Japan only) * AE92/AE111 Corolla/Conquest 1993‚Äì2002 (South Africa) * Geo Prizm base model (based on Toyota AE92 chassis) 1989‚Äì1997 =4A-FHE= Same as the first generation 4A-FE, only more aggressive tune for more output.

The cam covers feature black- and-blue lettering and the 'T-VIS' acronym is present on the intake manifold plenum. 4A-GE with T-VIS The most powerful of the 16-valve 4A-GE engines, commonly known as the \\"red top\\" (due to the red writing), which produces at 6,600 rpm. The cylinder head was developed by Yamaha Motor Corporation and was built at Toyota's Shimoyama plant alongside the 4A and 2A engines.Toyota Twin Cam, p. 22 The reliability and performance of these engines has earned them a fair number of enthusiasts and a fan base as they are a popular choice for an engine swap into other Toyota cars such as the KE70 and KP61. New performance parts are still available for sale even today because of its strong fan base. Production of the various models of this version lasted for five generations, from May 1983 through 1991 for 16-valve versions and the 20-valve 4A-GE lasting through 1998.  First Generation \\"Blue Top\\" (Early Bigport)  The first-generation 4A-GE which was introduced in 1983 replaced the 2T-G as Toyota's most popular twincam engine. This engine was identifiable via silver cam covers with the lettering on the upper cover painted black and blue, as well as the presence of three reinforcement ribs on the back side of the block. It was extremely light and strong for a production engine using an all- iron block, weighing in at only - over fifteen percent reduction compared to 2T-GEU. It was also 4 dB quieter. While originally conceived of as a two-valve design, Toyota and Yamaha changed the 4A-GE to a four-valve after a year of evaluation.Toyota Twin Cam, p. 15 The 4A-GE produced at 6,600 rpm and of torque at 4,800 rpm in the American market. The use of a vane-type air flow meter (AFM), which restricted air flow slightly but produced cleaner emissions that conformed to the U.S. regulations, limited the power considerably - the Japanese model, which uses a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor, was originally rated at . However, this was a gross power rating and the engine was later re-rated at net. Nonetheless, Japanese cars tested no faster than their American counterparts despite their higher power rating and a lower curb weight.Road & Track Magazine, November 1984 Toyota designed the engine for performance; the valve angle was a relatively wide 50 degrees, which at the time was believed to be ideal for high power production. Today, more modern high-revving engines have decreased the valve angle to 20 to 25 degrees, which is now believed to be ideal for high-revving engines with high specific power outputs. The first generation 4A-GE is nicknamed the \\"bigport\\" engine because it had intake ports of a very large cross-sectional area. While the port cross-section was suitable for a very highly modified engine at very high engine speeds, it caused a considerable drop in low-end torque due to the decreased air speeds at those rpms. To compensate for the reduced air speed, the first-generation engines included the T-VIS feature, in which dual intake runners are fitted with butterfly valves that opened at approximately 4,200 rpm. The effect is that at lower rpm (when the airspeed would normally be slow) four of the eight runners are closed, which forces the engine to draw in all its air through half the runners in the manifold. This not only raises the airspeed which causes better cylinder filling, but due to the asymmetrical airflow a swirl is created in the combustion chamber, meaning better fuel atomization. This enabled the torque curve to still be intact at lower engine speeds, allowing for better performance across the entire speed band and a broad, flat torque curve around the crossover point.Toyota Twin Cam, p. 11 During rising engine speed, a slight lurch can occur at the crossover point and an experienced driver will be able to detect the shift in performance. Production of the first-generation engine model lasted through 1987.  Second Generation \\"Red & Black Top\\" (Late Bigport)  The second-generation 4A-GE produced from 1987 to 1988 featured larger diameter bearings for the connecting-rod big ends and added four additional reinforcement ribs on the back of the engine block, for a total of seven. The T-VIS feature is maintained and MAP. It is visually similar to the first-generation engine (only the upper cam cover now featured red and black lettering) and the US market power output was only increased to . The first- and second-generation engines are very popular with racers and tuners because of their availability, ease of modification, simple design, and lightness.  Third Generation \\"Red Top\\" (Smallport)  The third-generation appeared in 1988 and was in production until 1992. This engine has the silver cam covers with the words only written in red, hence the nickname \\"red top\\". Toyota increased the compression ratio from 9.4:1 to 10.3:1. To correct the air-speed problems of the earlier generations, the intake ports in this cylinder head were re- designed to have a smaller cross-section, and hence it has been nicknamed the \\"smallport\\" head. This change in the intake ports negated the need for the earlier twin-runner intake manifold and it was replaced with a single-runner manifold. Additional engine modifications to extend life and reliability included under-piston cooling oil squirters, thicker connecting rods and other components. Also of note, the pistons were changed to accept a fully floating gudgeon pin unlike the pressed-in pins of the earlier versions. Other internal revisions were made to the pistons. They were slightly modified to make space for the under-piston cooling oil squirters found in this engine version. In addition to this, the piston ring size were changed to (top ring), 1.5mm (second ring) and (oil ring), this change in size made it difficult to obtain as compared to the earlier 16 valves versions of the 4AGE (top ring), (second ring), (oil ring). All non-U.S. market 4A-GEs continued to use a MAP sensor, while all of the U.S.-market 4A-GE engines came with a MAF sensor. For US- market cars this revision increased the power to at 7200 rpm with a torque of at 4800 rpm ( and Non US-Market versions (MAP Sensored) Make 8-10hp more at the crank The 4A-GE engine was first introduced in the 1983 Sprinter Trueno AE86 and the Corolla Levin AE86. The AE86 marked the end of the 4A-GE as a rear wheel drive (RWD or FR) mounted engine. Alongside the RWD AE86/AE85 coupes, a front wheel drive (FWD or FF) Corolla was produced and all future Corollas/Sprinters were based around the FF layout. The AW11 MR2 continued use of the engine as a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, transversely- mounted midship. The engine was retired from North American Corollas in 1991, although it continued to be available in the Geo Prizm GSi (sold through Chevrolet dealerships) from 1990 to 1992. All 4A-GE engines (including the 20-valve versions below) feature a forged crankshaft rather than a cheaper and more commonly used cast version. Clarification: In the U.S. market, the 4A-GE engine was first used in the 1985 model year Corolla GT-S only, which is identified as an \\"AE88\\" in the VIN but uses the AE86 chassis code on the firewall as the AE88 is a \\"sub\\" version of the AE86. The 4A-GE engines for the 1985 model year are referred to as \\"blue top\\" as opposed to the later \\"red top\\" engines, because the paint color on the valve covers is different, to show the different engine revision, using different port sizes, different airflow metering, and other minor differences on the engine. The American Spec AE86 (VIN AE88, or GT-S) carried the 4A-GE engine. In other markets, other designations were used. Much confusion exists, even among dealers, as to which models contained what equipment, especially since Toyota split the Corolla line into both RWD and FWD versions, and the GT-S designation was only well known as a Celica version at that time. In South Africa in 1993 the 4A-GE engine was dropped and replaced with the 7A-FE even as other countries moved towards the 20 valve 4A-GE, as South African fuel was not suitable at the time for the 4A-GE 20valve. ;Applications: * AA63 Carina 1983.06‚Äì1985 (Japan only) * AT160 Carina 1985‚Äì1988 (Japan only) * AT171 Carina 1988‚Äì1992 (Japan only) * AA63 Celica 1983‚Äì1985 * AT160 Celica 1985‚Äì1989 * AE82 Corolla saloon, FX 1984.10‚Äì1987 * AE86 Corolla Levin 1983.05‚Äì1987 * AE92 Corolla 1987‚Äì1993 * AT141 Corona 1983.10‚Äì1985 (Japan only) * AT160 Corona 1985‚Äì1988 (Japan only) * AW11 MR2 1984.06‚Äì1989 * AE82 Sprinter 1984.10‚Äì1987 (Japan only) * AE86 Sprinter Trueno 1983.05‚Äì1987 (Japan only) * AE92 Sprinter 1987‚Äì1992 (Japan only) * AE82/AE92 Corolla GLi Twincam/Conquest RSi 1986‚Äì1993 (South Africa) * Chevrolet Nova (based on Corolla AE82) * Geo Prizm GSi (based on Toyota AE92 chassis) 1990‚Äì1992 Specifications: * Engine displacement: * Layout: DOHC Inline-4 * Bore and Stroke: * Dry Weight (with T50 gearbox): * Valves: 16, 4 per each cylinder * Power: at 6,600 rpm * Torque: at 5,800 rpm * Redline: 7,600 rpm * Fuel Delivery System: MPFI =4A-GE (20-valve)= Silver Top 20-Valve 4A-GE Fourth Generation \\"Silver Top\\" The fourth-generation 4A-GE engine was produced from 1991 to 1995. It has silver cam covers with chrome lettering, hence the nickname \\"silver top\\". This engine yet again features a completely new cylinder head which uses five valves per cylinder instead of four. It uses Toyota's Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system on the intake cam, an increased compression ratio (10.5:1), and the intake system was replaced with a short manifold with individual throttles and velocity stacks, however the vane-type airflow meter was retained, requiring the use of a plenum. The previous 16-valve head used a sharply curved intake port, while the 20-valve engine used a very upright straight port. This engine produces at 7,400 rpm with of torque at 5,200 rpm.

It uses Toyota Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system on the intake cam. This engine is commonly known as the \\"black top\\" due to the color of the valve cover, and yet again features an even higher compression ratio (11:1). The air flow sensor was replaced by a MAP sensor, the diameter of the four individual throttle bodies was increased from , the exhaust ports diameter were increased by 3 mm, the intake cam lift was increased from , and the intake ports were significantly improved in shape and contour, with the width of the opening at the head increased as well. Additionally, the black top had a lighter flywheel, a larger plenum, lighter connecting rods and revised rubber velocity stacks, and was also offered in 1997 with a six-speed C160 transaxle. This revision increased the power to at 7,800 rpm with of torque at 5,600 rpm. The 'Blacktop' has become a favorite among enthusiasts and is used as an easy power upgrade for the early Toyota Corolla models, especially for use in the drift scene. Due to the relatively high state of tuning of the stock engine, most power/torque gains come from higher lift cams and engine management. Toyota's 20-valve power figures are sometimes believed to be inflated, however this is more than likely caused by people using less than 100 RON fuel which both 20-valve engines require. ;Applications: * AE111 Corolla Levin coupe 1995‚Äì2000 (Japan only) * AE111 Sprinter Trueno coupe 1995‚Äì2000 (Japan only) * AE101 Corolla Ceres hardtop 1995‚Äì1998 (Japan only) * AE101 Sprinter Marino hardtop 1995‚Äì1998 (Japan only) * AE101G Corolla BZ touring wagon 1995‚Äì1999 (Japan) * AE111 Corolla 1995‚Äì2000 (Japan only) * AE111 Sprinter 1995‚Äì1999 (Japan only) * AE111 Sprinter Carib 1997‚Äì2000 (Japan only) * AE111 Corolla RSi and RXi 1997‚Äì2002 (South Africa) * AT210 Carina 1996-2001 (Japan only) =4A-GZE= The bigport variant of the 4A-GZE from the Toyota MR2 Supercharged. Note the roots type supercharger on the intake side. 1G-GZE and 2TZ-FZE were the only factory supercharged engines manufactured by Toyota. The 4A-GZE (produced in various forms from August 1986 through 1995) was a supercharged version of the 4A-GE. Based on the same block and cylinder head, the 4A-GZE engine was equipped with a Roots type supercharger producing peak manifold pressure, and the compression ratio was lowered to 8:1 with the use of forged and dished pistons. Although fitted with upgraded pistons, they still had the same ports, valve timing, and head gasket as the naturally aspirated 4A-GE engine, although T-VIS was omitted. It was used in the supercharged MR2, rated at at 6400 rpm and at 4400. In 1990 it was updated with the \\"smallport\\" cylinder head, 8.9:1 compression, and MAP D-Jetronic load sensing and a smaller supercharger pulley producing . These updated 4A-GZE engines were rated at and for the 1990/1991 AE92 Corolla and for the AE101. The 4A-GZE is also popular for turbo conversions, as many parts do not need to be modified to support the extra boost.4AG Tech Notes .

Produced from 1993 to 2002, it was a 4-valve DOHC narrow-valve-angle economy engine stroked out from the 4A, also using the 4A-FE's slave-cam concept. Cylinder bore and stroke was . An early Canadian version produced at 5600 rpm and at 2800 rpm. The common (1993 to 1995 North American) version is rated at at 5600 rpm and at 2800 rpm. The engine output was changed for the 1996 to 1997 (North American) version mainly due to a different antipollution system and different intake which made it rate at at 5200 rpm and of torque at 2800 rpm. In the United States, the 7A-FE's most common application was in the 1993‚Äì1997 Corolla (7th generation). The engine was also used in some 1994‚Äì1999 Celicas (6th generation) at the base ST trim level, as well as the Toyota Corolla's clone, the Geo Prizm. The Indonesian and Russian version of the 7A-FE has the strongest naturally aspirated output, at 6000 rpm and at 4400 rpm, with 9.5 compression ratio. It appears in the 8th generation Corolla (AE112). In the Australian market, the AE112 Corolla Sportivo had a turbocharged 7A-FE, sometimes referred to as a 7A-FTE. Output was at 5,600 rpm, at 3600 rpm. Only 110 Corolla Sportivos were built. It is a non-interference type engine. Toyota never made a wide-valve angle \\"7A-GE\\" based on the 7A, but many enthusiasts have created one using a combination of 7A-FE parts (block and crank), 4A-GE parts (head, pistons) and custom connecting rods. The '7A-FE' has a smaller crank journal, and smaller wrist pins (press fit) so a few companies have made special rods to accommodate these builds. Likewise, an unofficial supercharged \\"7A-GZE\\" has also been built from 7A-FE parts (block, crank), 4A-GZE parts (head, pistons) and custom connecting rods. =7A-FE= Applications: * AT211 Avensis 1997‚Äì2000 (Europe only) * AT191 Caldina 1996‚Äì1997 (Japan only) * AT211 Caldina 1997‚Äì2001 (Japan only) * AT191 Carina 1994‚Äì1996 (Japan only) * AT211 Carina 1996‚Äì2001 (Japan only) * AT191 Carina E 1994‚Äì1997 (Europe only) * AT200 Celica 1993‚Äì1999 (excluding Japan) * AE92 Corolla/Conquest September 1993 ‚Äì circa 1998 (South Africa) * AE93 Corolla 1990‚Äì1992 (Australia only) * AE102/103 Corolla 1992‚Äì1998 (excluding Japan) * AE102 Corolla/Prizm 1993‚Äì1997 (North America) * AE111 Corolla ¬±1997 ‚Äì ¬±2000 (South Africa) * AE112/115 Corolla 1997‚Äì2002 (excluding Japan) * AE115 Corolla Spacio 1997‚Äì2001 (Japan only) * AT191 Corona 1994‚Äì1997 (excluding Japan) * AT211 Corona 1996‚Äì2001 (Japan only) * AE115 Sprinter Carib 1995‚Äì2001 (Japan only) 8A A 8A is now produced by Tianjin FAW Xiali for its Daihatsu and Toyota-based subcompacts.

The route then cuts across the narrow eastern tip of McClain County, where it begins concurrencies with both State Highway 59 and State Highway 3W. The three highways then cross the Canadian River into Pottawatomie County, where they meet SH-39 at a four-way stop in Asher. Near unincorporated Pearson, SH-59 splits off to the east. US-177/SH-3W continue north to Tecumseh, where they have an interchange with SH-9. At this interchange, US-270 joins the concurrency. The three highways run along the west side of Shawnee. At the Interstate 40 interchange, SH-3W reunites with SH-3E, and the unified SH-3 (along with US-270) follows I-40. US-177 continues northward alone. After crossing into Lincoln County, US-177 meets US-62 in Jacktown. Just west of Warwick, it meets SH-66 (old Route 66), and then passes under Interstate 44 (the Turner Turnpike), with no interchange. I-44 is accessed through the SH-66 ‚Äì Wellston (Exit 157) interchange. US-177 then continues north, connecting to the town of Carney via SH-40A, the shortest state highway in Oklahoma. West of Tryon, it intersects State Highway 105. It then enters Payne County just south of the Cimarron River. In Payne County, US-177 almost immediately passes through the town of Perkins. North of that community, it has a one-mile (1.6 km) concurrency with State Highway 33. It then passes through the county seat, Stillwater, the home of Oklahoma State University. There, it intersects SH-51. North of Stillwater, it serves as the western terminus of the Cimarron Turnpike Spur. Farther north, in Noble County, it crosses US-64 and the mainline of the Cimarron Turnpike. It then has a four mile (6.4 km) concurrency with State Highway 15. US-177 then enters its final county in Oklahoma, Kay County. It serves Ponca City, where it begins a wrong-way concurrency with its parent, US-77, as well as US-60 (which is signed the \\"correct\\" direction). The routes split near Tonkawa. US-177 then runs through Blackwell and Braman. North of Braman, the route is the northernmost exit on Interstate 35 in Oklahoma. Six miles (9.7 km) after the I-35 junction, US-177 leaves Oklahoma. =Kansas= US-177's northern terminus in South Haven, Kansas US-177 then enters Sumner County, Kansas near Hunnewell. Only 4 mi (6.4 km) north of the state line, US-177 ends at US-81 in downtown South Haven, Kansas. The terminus is less than a mile from the western terminus of US-166 (also on US-81) north of town. History Originally, the highway functioned as a shortcut for Wichita to Oklahoma City traffic traveling between US-81 at South Haven, KS and US-77 at Three Sands Jct, Oklahoma (where US-77 and State Highway 156 intersect outside Marland, Oklahoma today). During the 1960s, the highway was extended south to Madill, Oklahoma, replacing the entire length of State Highway 40 from Ponca City, Oklahoma to then-US-66 (near Wellston, Oklahoma) and the portion of State Highway 18 between Shawnee, Oklahoma and Madill, Oklahoma (the segment between US-66 and Shawnee was constructed at this time). Vestiages of these highways remain in spur routes State Highway 40A, located entirely in Carney, Oklahoma and State Highway 18A, located south of Sulphur, Oklahoma. During this extension, the alignments of US-77 and US-177 were altered in North Central Oklahoma as follows: US-77 was relocated to run north from Three Sands Jct to Tonkawa, Oklahoma on the former route of US-177, then east on US-60 to Ponca City, Oklahoma. This also involved a new US-60 alignment between Tonkawa, Oklahoma and Ponca City, Oklahoma, where US-60, US-77, and US-177 all overlap on the same highway (which results in northbound US-77, eastbound US-60, and southbound US-177 traffic running in the same compass direction: east). Junction list State Highway 40A State Highway 40A is an highway in Lincoln County, Oklahoma. It is numbered after State Highway 40, the predecessor to US-177. It is the shortest state highway in Oklahoma. The highway connects US-177 to the town of Carney, Oklahoma. It has a 25 mph (40 km/h) speed limit.

The operating system (OS) is designed for real-time embedded systems for medical, industrial, consumer, aerospace, and Internet of things (IoT) uses. Nucleus was released first in 1993. The latest version is 3.x, and includes features such as power management, process model, 64-bit support, safety certification, and support for heterogeneous computing multi- core system on a chip (SOCs) processors. Nucleus process model adds space domain partitioning for task and module isolation on SOCs with either a memory management unit (MMU) or memory protection unit (MPU), such as those based on ARMv7/8 Cortex-A/R/M cores.  Supported platforms  Nucleus supports many embedded processors including leading ARMv7 Cortex A, R, and M devices. Recent releases support ARMv8 64-bit devices. The official website has a full list of supported devices. It includes 32-bit MCUs and MPUs, configurable devices, and 32-bit and 64-bit multi-core processors.  History  Nucleus 1.x was released first in 1993 by Accelerated Technology (ATI) as Nucleus PLUS. It soon became one of the most commonly used RTOSs in the embedded market. Following its early success there, ATI added support for networking, graphics, and file systems, which accelerated adoption. Mentor Graphics acquired ATI in March 2002, which was soon followed by the second generation of Nucleus RTOS. Version 2.x was released in 2003, improving its portability across different architectures and tool sets. New components like IPv6, Flash memory file system and Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.0 were added. Mentor replaced the legacy Codelab debugger with EDGE development tools which included compiler tools, debugger, simulator, and profiler. Mentor Graphics introduced the 3rd generation Nucleus in 2010. Version 3.x was intended for both high-end microprocessor units (MPUs), microcontroller units (MCUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). For devices with limited memory resources, Nucleus was designed to scale down to a memory size of <10 kilobytes (KBs) for both code and data. Nucleus 3.x introduced support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) both unsupervised uAMP and supervised sAMP (using Mentor Embedded Hypervisor). Other additions in Nucleus 3.x: * Integrated power management support for kernel and middleware components; includes support for DVFS, tick suppression, and sleep modes including hibernation. * Process model for memory partitioning to support dynamic loading and unloading of application modules. Loadable processes are supported on both high end MPUs and low end MCUs with or without hardware memory management support. * Wireless support * IoT protocols * Safety certification for aerospace, medical, industrial and automotive * Support for ARM TrustZone * Mentor embedded multi-core framework for IPC and processor life cycle management for AMP designs (both supervised sAMP and unsupervised uAMP) * Runtime tracing support with host side analysis tools In addition to the new features in version 3.x, Nucleus moved business model from a la carte, to one unified package. Mentor acquired CodeSourcery in Dec 2010 to replace the EDGE development tools with the Sourcery CodeBench. Sourcery CodeBench comprises a compiler tool-chain, debugger, and trace analysis tools. The compiler tool-chain is based on GNU tool-chain. The debugger and integrated development environment (IDE) are based on Eclipse. Sourcery CodeBench supports ARM, IA-32, MIPS, and PPC architectures with built-in workflows and OS awareness for Nucleus RTOS and Mentor Embedded Linux. Nucleus 3.x introduced a unified build and configuration system with which the Kernel is configured through a single file and builds as a single library. Like menuconfig in Linux, a user interface (UI) based configuration tool integrated with CodeBench provides the user with graphically selectable components to customize the kernel at build time. The Nucleus configuration system allows for user customization to integrate new tool-chains, architecture support and build properties. Major components Nucleus RTOS components include: # Kernel # Services # Connectivity #File system # Networking # IoT Framework # Wireless # Security # UI & graphics = Kernel = * Real-time kernel with priority based pre-emptive scheduling * Support for dynamic linking using loadable modules * C++, POSIX, and microITRON interfaces * SMP/AMP (both supervised and unsupervised) * SMP support and runtime control for bound computation domain and affinities to processor cores for tasks and interrupts * Support for 64-bit architectures * Scale-able to fit memory constrained devices * Built-in power management framework * Source code for all components = Services = * Run-level initialization and registry * POSIX: kernel, networking, and file system * Shell and tracing * Debug agent * C++ * Power management services = Connectivity = Nucleus supports the ability to connect to other devices through various interfaces including: * USB 2.0 and 3.0 * USB Host, Function, and On-The-Go (OTG) stacks * Bluetooth with many advanced profiles enabled (A2DP, AVRCP, HFP, HSP, etc.) * Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), PCI-X and PCIe * Controller Area Network (CAN) and CANopen * Secure Digital (SDIO) * SPI, QSPI * Inter- Integrated Circuit (I¬≤C) = File system = Unlike Windows and Unix-like operating systems, Nucleus does not need a file system to work. However, for complex uses needing local storage, Nucleus supports several file systems including FAT, SAFE (fault tolerant), and LWEXT.  Multiple simultaneous file systems  * File Allocation Table (FAT) * SAFE (high reliability power fail safe) * LWEXT * Install-able third-party file systems  Multiple media support  * CD-ROM * Hard drive * RAM disk * NOR and NAND flash * USB drive * SD MMC Nucleus provides support for different file systems and storage media though a virtual file system application programming interface (API) that allows access to the supported file systems and storage devices using the same functions calls regardless of the underlying storage format. = Networking = The Nucleus networking stack is a dual IPv4 and IPv6 stack that supports over 60 networking protocols. Nucleus networking stack supports POSIX and provides an easy to use socket based application interface. A brief list of the supported protocols include: * Internet protocol suite (UDP, TCP/IP) * Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), network address translation (NAT) * Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPoE) * File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Telnet, Secure Shell (SSH) * Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP , Network Time Protocol (NTP) * Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and HTTPS * JSON-XML, WebSockets = Security = Nucleus supports a wide variety of encryption options for secure communications to protect data at rest or in transit. Nucleus ships with OpenSSL and an OpenSSL-like package wolfSSL (formerly CyaSSL) that is far smaller than OpenSSL for designs needing encryption but limited in memory capacity. Security protocols to protect data in transit include IPsec/IKE, SSH/SSL/TLS/DTLS. Encryption includes DES, 3DES, AES, SHA-256. Public-key cryptography algorithms include RSA. Support includes X.509, RADIUS, and 802.1X. = Wireless = Several Wi-Fi modules from different chip-makers like QCA, Broadcom, TI, and CSR are supported: * IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n * IEEE 802.15.4 * Bluetooth, Bluetooth LE = UI graphics = Nucleus 3.x supports OpenGL and leading 3rd party UI libraries. Nucleus supports the Qt UI framework which has been optimized for code size and integrated into CodeBench for debugging and tracing. Other UIs supported include Embedded Wizard and Socionext CGI Studio. = IoT = Recent releases of Nucleus include support for HTTPS, Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), MQTT and 6LoWPAN. Nucleus has also announced support for Microsoft Azure cloud computing framework. = Industrial = Nucleus has been integrated with 3rd party industrial stacks from industry leaders. Industrial stack support includes OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) host and client and EtherNet/IP from Softing and EtherCAT from KoenigPa. = Multi-core = Nucleus supports asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) mode and symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) mode for leading 32 and 64-bit heterogeneous multi-core SoCs. Nucleus is also capable of running as a GOS with Mentor Embedded Hypervisor. When operating in AMP mode, Nucleus RTOS can coexist with other instances of Nucleus, Linux, and/or bare machine (metal) programs distributed on the other processors. In this mode, each processor is running independently and behaves as a separate system within the SoC. Mentor Embedded Multicore Framework provides interprocess communication between operating systems on the various cores, and processor life cycle management. SMP operation entails having a instantiation of Nucleus RTOS manage multiple cores simultaneously. Nucleus can distribute its operations across all cores on a multi-core device, or any subset of cores. For this purpose Nucleus offers runtime API support for bound computation domain, and control tasks and interrupt affinities for core assignment. = Product packages = Nucleus RTOS is packaged as follows: * Nucleus ReadyStart Edition ReadyStart which includes the runtime system, middleware, BSP (all in source code) and the IDE, debugger, compiling tools, trace bundle in a single package. Nucleus Ready Start comes in versions packaged for ARM, MIPS and PPC. Nucleus ReadyStart adds specialized eclipse plugins to CodeBench to provide simplified build and configuration workflows and debugging enhancements including kernel awareness, loadable module support, tracing and profiling tools. * Nucleus Source Code Edition contains the runtime system and middleware packaged to support unique architectures and/or different tool chains = Safety certification= Nucleus SafetyCert has been certified for the highest levels of safety for DO-178C, IEC 61508, IEC 62304, and ISO 26262.

The summer-only season usually consists of four productions performed in rotating repertory. Glimmerglass is well known for producing new, lesser-known, and rare works, many of which in years past have been co- produced with the New York City Opera. It is the second-largest summer opera festival in the United States, led by Artistic and General Director Francesca Zambello. History Until 2011, the company operated under the name Glimmerglass Opera. The company presented its first season in the summer of 1975, when four performances of La boh√®me were staged in the auditorium of the Cooperstown High School. In the years since, it has grown considerably and now offers more than 40 performances of four operas, nearly always in new productions, each summer. Operas have been performed in repertory since 1990. For the first seventeen seasons, all operas were sung in English; since 1992 they have, with some exceptions, been performed in their original language with projected titles in English. Several works have had their American or world premieres at Glimmerglass; the 1999 season featured the world premiere of Central Park, three one-act operas performed as a single work. The triptych was jointly commissioned by Glimmerglass Opera, New York City Opera, and Thirteen/WNET's Great Performances, which telecast it on PBS in January 2000. The telecast was nominated for an Emmy Award. Paul Kellogg was the General Director of Glimmerglass Opera from 1979 to 1996 and the Artistic Director from 1996 to 2006. Esther Nelson took on the role of General Director from 1996 to 2003. Stewart Robertson was music director of Glimmerglass Opera from 1988 to 2006. In October 2008, Glimmerglass Opera announced the appointment of David Angus as the company's next music director, starting in the summer of 2010. Francesca Zambello became artistic and general director of the newly renamed Glimmerglass Festival in 2011. The Young American Artists Program, established in 1988, brings singers in the first stages of their professional careers to study and perform at Glimmerglass. These young artists are chosen annually from hundreds of applicants from throughout the United States. In addition to rehearsing and performing, Young Artists receive musical coaching, attend classes in diction and acting, and are given instruction in such non- performing skills as audition techniques, role preparation, and the business aspects of managing a career. Administrators from many of the world's leading opera houses visit Glimmerglass throughout the summer and hear the Young Artists in performance. In the course of the summer each Young Artist gives a solo song recital at venues in Cooperstown and nearby Cherry Valley, a feature of the Glimmerglass season that has become extremely popular with opera patrons and the local community. Alice Busch Opera Theater The Glimmerglass Festival's Alice Busch Opera Theater, which opened in June 1987, was built on of farmland donated by Tom Goodyear, its first chairman. The 914-seat theater is notable for its pastoral setting, for being the first American opera house built since 1966, and for its sliding walls, closed only while singers are on-stage and in foul weather. The Theater was designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates. The new theater was built to move the performances from a high school auditorium with poor acoustics and sight lines and no orchestra pit to a building with an interior designed specifically for opera performances. The exterior design was inspired by local farm buildings to fit with the surrounding landscape and to promote a less formal and more relaxed atmosphere suitable for a summer theater. For environmental and cost efficiencies, the building was designed to use only natural ventilation, without any mechanical heating or cooling. Recent festival seasons The Festival's 2010 season featured four new productions, including Copland's The Tender Land, and Handel's Tolomeo. During the 2011 season Cherubini's M√©d√©e was presented. Also, a double bill featuring the world premiere of A Blizzard on Marblehead Neck, with music by Jeanine Tesori set to Tony Kushner's libretto (a story inspired by the life of Eugene O'Neill) along with Later the Same Evening, a one-act opera based on characters in five of Edward Hopper's paintings with a score by John Musto from a libretto by Mark Campbell. In 2012, the festival featured Verdi's Aida, Lully's Armide, Kurt Weill's Lost in the Stars and the musical The Music Man. Armide was presented in collaboration with Opera Atelier of Toronto, Canada, and Lost in the Stars presented in collaboration with Cape Town Opera of South Africa.

Different statistical surveys may measure related, but different, universes and have to be adjusted to reflect this difference.

The differences in the populations and behavior that these two surveys measure are said to be the differences in their \\"universe\\".

Since the revival of anarchism around the start of the 21st century and concurrent with the rise of the anti-globalization movement, anarchist cultural symbols are widely present.  Flags  = Red flag = The red flag was one of first anarchist symbols and it was widely used in late 19th century by anarchists worldwide. Peter Kropotkin preferred the use of the red flag. Use of the red flag by anarchists disappeared after the October Revolution, when red flags started to be associated only with Bolshevism and communist parties and authoritarian, bureaucratic and reformist social democracy, or authoritarian socialism. = Black flag = A black flag being raised at the G20 Protests The black flag and the color black in general have been associated with anarchism since the 1880s. Many anarchist collectives contain the word \\"black\\" in their names. There have been a number of anarchist periodicals entitled Black Flag. The uniform blackness of the flag is in stark contrast to the colorful flags typical of most nation states. Additionally, as a white flag has been used to request parley or to surrender, the black flag symbolizes defiance and opposition to surrender.  Historical origins  The black flag represents the absence of a flag and thus stands in opposition to the very notion of nation states. In that light, the flag can be seen as a rejection of the concept of representation, or the idea that any person or institution can adequately represent a group of individuals. Modern anarchism has a shared ancestry with‚Äîamongst other ideologies‚Äîsocialism, a movement strongly associated with the red flag. As anarchism became more and more distinct from socialism in the 1880s, it adopted the black flag in an attempt to differentiate itself. However, some anarchists at the time such as Peter Kropotkin preferred to continue using the red flag rather than adopt the black.  Subsequent use  The black flag first became associated with anarchism in the 1880s. The French anarchist paper, Le Drapeau Noir (The Black Flag), which existed until 1882, is one of the first published references to use black as an anarchist color. Black International was the name of a London anarchist group founded in July 1881. However, credit for the first known use the black flag has been reserved for Louise Michel, participant in the Paris Commune in 1871. Michel flew the black flag during a demonstration of the unemployed which took place in Paris on March 9, 1883. With Michel at the front carrying a black flag and shouting \\"Bread, work, or lead!,\\" the crowd of 500 protesters soon marched off towards the boulevard Saint-Germain and pillaged three baker's shops before the police arrested them. Michel was arrested and sentenced to six years solitary confinement. Public pressure soon forced the granting of an amnesty. According to Michel, the \\"black flag is the flag of strikes and the flag of those who are hungry\\". The black flag soon made its way to the United States. The black flag was displayed in Chicago at an anarchist demonstration in November 1884. According to the English language newspaper of the Chicago anarchists, it was \\"the fearful symbol of hunger, misery and death\\". = Bisected flag = The colors black and red have been used by anarchists since at least the late 1800s when they were used on cockades by Italian anarchists in the 1874 Bologna insurrection and in 1877 when anarchists entered the Italian town Letino carrying red and black flags to promote the First International. Diagonally divided red and black flags were popularized during the Spanish Civil War by the anarcho-syndicalist labor union CNT and are used to this day by anarchist organizations. Similar flags yet with different colors are commonly used to represent specific anarchist ideologies such as black and purple for anarcha-feminism, black and green for green anarchism and black and orange for mutualism. A similar flag is used by many anarcho-capitalists, using the colors gold and black, representing capitalism and anarchism respectively.The gold-black flag was first used publicly at a 1963 event organized by the libertarian businessman Robert LeFevre in the State of Colorado. Source: Rothbard, Murray N. (2007) The Betrayal of the American Right. Ludwig von Mises Institute. p. 188. However, many anti-capitalist anarchists argue that anarchism is in principle anti- capitalist and that makes anarcho-capitalism an oxymoron.Bolo'Bolo (2014) p. 215.  Circle-A  The circle-A is almost certainly the best-known present- day symbol for anarchy. It is a monogram that consists of the capital letter \\"A\\" surrounded by the capital letter \\"O\\". The letter \\"A\\" is derived from the first letter of \\"anarchy\\" or \\"anarchism\\" in most European languages and is the same in both Latin and Cyrillic scripts. The \\"O\\" stands for order and together they stand for \\"society seeks order in anarchy\\" (), a phrase written by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in his 1840 book What Is Property? The 19th century International Workingmen's Association, founded by British and French trade- union leaders, used a circle-A as their logo. The 1970s punk rock and anarcho- punk movement spread the circle-A symbol more widely and raised awareness of it among non-anarchists. This process began with the use of anarchist imagery when members of the band Crass became aware of the symbol while traveling through France.  Black cat  An Industrial Workers of the World stickerette or silent agitator The black cat, also called the \\"wild cat\\" or \\"sabot-cat\\", usually with an arched back and with claws and teeth bared, is closely associated with anarchism, especially with anarcho-syndicalism. It was designed by Ralph Chaplin, who was a prominent figure in the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). As its stance suggests, the cat is meant to suggest wildcat strikes and radical unionism. The IWW was an important industrial union and was the first American labor union to recruit and organize women and people of color, playing a critical role in the fight for the eight-hour day and in free speech fights all over the country in the early 20th century. Their most famous and influential years were from 1905 until they were largely suppressed by the Palmer Raids in 1919‚Äì1920. The origin of the black cat symbol is unclear, but according to one story it came from an IWW strike that was going badly. Several members had been beaten up and were put in a hospital. At that time a skinny, black cat walked into the striker's camp. The cat was fed by the striking workers and as the cat regained its health the strike took a turn for the better. Eventually the striking workers got some of their demands and they adopted the cat as their mascot.What's this with a black cat & a wooden shoe? What do they have to do with anarchy? The name Black Cat has been used for numerous anarchist-affiliated collectives and cooperatives, including a music venue in Austin (which was closed following a July 6, 2002 fire) and a now-defunct \\"collective kitchen\\" in the University District of Seattle.

It is one of the cornerstones of behavioral economics and its brain-basis is actively being studied by neuroeconomics researchers. The discounted utility approach states that intertemporal choices are no different from other choices, except that some consequences are delayed and hence must be anticipated and discounted (i.e., reweighted to take into account the delay). Given two similar rewards, humans show a preference for one that arrives sooner rather than later. Humans are said to discount the value of the later reward, by a factor that increases with the length of the delay. In the financial world, this process is normally modeled in the form of exponential discounting, a time-consistent model of discounting. Many psychological studies have since demonstrated deviations in instinctive preference from the constant discount rate assumed in exponential discounting. Hyperbolic discounting is an alternative mathematical model that agrees more closely with these findings. According to hyperbolic discounting, valuations fall relatively rapidly for earlier delay periods (as in, from now to one week), but then fall more slowly for longer delay periods (for instance, more than a few days). For example, in an early study subjects said they would be indifferent between receiving $15 immediately or $30 after 3 months, $60 after 1 year, or $100 after 3 years. These indifferences reflect annual discount rates that declined from 277% to 139% to 63% as delays got longer. This contrasts with exponential discounting, in which valuation falls by a constant factor per unit delay and the discount rate stays the same. The standard experiment used to reveal a test subject's hyperbolic discounting curve is to compare short-term preferences with long-term preferences. For instance: \\"Would you prefer a dollar today or three dollars tomorrow?\\" or \\"Would you prefer a dollar in one year or three dollars in one year and one day?\\" It has been claimed that a significant fraction of subjects will take the lesser amount today, but will gladly wait one extra day in a year in order to receive the higher amount instead. Individuals with such preferences are described as \\"present-biased\\". The most important consequence of hyperbolic discounting is that it creates temporary preferences for small rewards that occur sooner over larger, later ones. Individuals using hyperbolic discounting reveal a strong tendency to make choices that are inconsistent over time ‚Äì they make choices today that their future self would prefer not to have made, despite knowing the same information. This dynamic inconsistency happens because hyperbolas distort the relative value of options with a fixed difference in delays in proportion to how far the choice-maker is from those options. Observations The phenomenon of hyperbolic discounting is implicit in Richard Herrnstein's \\"matching law\\", which states that when dividing their time or effort between two non-exclusive, ongoing sources of reward, most subjects allocate in direct proportion to the rate and size of rewards from the two sources, and in inverse proportion to their delays. That is, subjects' choices \\"match\\" these parameters. After the report of this effect in the case of delay, George Ainslie pointed out that in a single choice between a larger, later and a smaller, sooner reward, inverse proportionality to delay would be described by a plot of value by delay that had a hyperbolic shape, and that when the smaller, sooner reward is preferred, this preference can be reversed by increasing both rewards' delays by the same absolute amount. Ainslie's research showed that a substantial number of subjects reported that they would prefer $50 immediately rather than $100 in six months, but would NOT prefer $50 in 3 months rather than $100 in nine months, even though this was the same choice seen at 3 months‚Äô greater distance. More significantly, those subjects who said they preferred $50 in 3 months to $100 in 9 months said they would NOT prefer $50 in 12 months to $100 in 18 months‚Äîagain, the same pair of options at a different distance‚Äîshowing that the preference-reversal effect did not depend on the excitement of getting an immediate reward.Ainslie, George and Haendel, V. (1983) The motives of the will. in E. Gottheil, K. Druley, T. Skodola, H. Waxman (eds.),Etiology Aspects of Alcohol and Drug Abuse, Springfield, Ill.: Charles C. Thomas, pp. 119-140. Nor does it depend on human culture; the first preference reversal findings were in rats and pigeons. Many subsequent experiments have confirmed that spontaneous preferences by both human and nonhuman subjects follow a hyperbolic curve rather than the conventional, exponential curve that would produce consistent choice over time. For instance, when offered the choice between $50 now and $100 a year from now, many people will choose the immediate $50. However, given the choice between $50 in five years or $100 in six years almost everyone will choose $100 in six years, even though that is the same choice seen at five years' greater distance. Hyperbolic discounting has also been found to relate to real-world examples of self-control. Indeed, a variety of studies have used measures of hyperbolic discounting to find that drug- dependent individuals discount delayed consequences more than matched nondependent controls, suggesting that extreme delay discounting is a fundamental behavioral process in drug dependence. Some evidence suggests pathological gamblers also discount delayed outcomes at higher rates than matched controls. Whether high rates of hyperbolic discounting precede addictions or vice versa is currently unknown, although some studies have reported that high-rate discounters are more likely to consume alcohol and cocaine than lower-rate discounters. Likewise, some have suggested that high- rate hyperbolic discounting makes unpredictable (gambling) outcomes more satisfying. The degree of discounting is vitally important in describing hyperbolic discounting, especially in the discounting of specific rewards such as money. The discounting of monetary rewards varies across age groups due to the varying discount rate. The rate depends on a variety of factors, including the species being observed, age, experience, and the amount of time needed to consume the reward. Mathematical model =Step-by-step explanation= Suppose that in a study, participants are offered the choice between taking x dollars immediately or taking y dollars n days later. Suppose further that one participant in that study employs exponential discounting and another employs hyperbolic discounting. Each participant will realize that a) they should take x dollars immediately if they can invest the dollar in a different venture that will yield more than y dollars n days later and b) they will be indifferent between the choices (selecting one at random) if the best available alternative will likewise yield y dollars n days later. (Assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the values of all available investments are compounded daily.) Each participant correctly understands the fundamental question being asked: \\"For any given value of y dollars and n days, what is the minimum amount of money, i.e., the minimum value for x dollars, that I should be willing to accept? In other words, how many dollars would I need to invest today to get y dollars n days from now?\\" Each will take x dollars if x is greater than the answer that they calculate, and each will take y dollars n days from now if x is smaller than that answer. However, the methods that they use to calculate that amount and the answers that they get will be different, and only the exponential discounter will use the correct method and get a reliably correct result: * The exponential discounter will think \\"The best alternative investment available (that is, the best investment available in the absence of this choice) gives me a return of r percent per day; in other words, once a day it adds to its value r percent of the value that it had the previous day. That is, every day it multiplies its value once by (100% + r%). So if I hold the investment for n days, its value will have multiplied itself by this amount n times, making that value (100% + r%)^n of what it was at the start ‚Äì that is, (1 + r%)^n times what it was at the start. So to figure out how much I would need to start with today to get y dollars n days from now, I need to divide y dollars by ([1 + r%]^n). If my other choice of how much money to take is greater than this result, then I should take the other amount, invest it in the other venture that I have in mind, and get even more at the end. If this result is greater than my other choice, then I should take y dollars n days from now, because it turns out that by giving up the other choice I am essentially investing that smaller amount of money to get y dollars n days from now, meaning that I'm getting an even greater return by waiting n days for y dollars, making this my best available investment.\\" * The hyperbolic discounter, however, will think \\"If I want y dollars n days from now, then the amount that I need to invest today is y divided by n, because that amount times n equals y dollars. [There lies the hyperbolic discounter's error.] If my other choice is greater than this result, I should take it instead because x times n will be greater than y times n; if it is less than this result, then I should wait n days for y dollars.\\" Where the exponential discounter reasons correctly and the hyperbolic discounter goes wrong is that as n becomes very large, the value of (1 + r %)^n becomes much larger than the value of n, with the effect that the value of y / [(1 + r %)^n] becomes much smaller than the value of y /n. Therefore, the minimum value of x (the number of dollars in the immediate choice) that suffices to be greater than that amount will be much smaller than the hyperbolic discounter thinks, with the result that they will perceive x-values in the range from y / [(1 + r %)^n] to y/n (inclusive at the low end) as being too small and, as a result, irrationally turn those alternatives down when they are in fact the better investment. =Formal model= Hyperbolic discounting is mathematically described as :g(D)=\\\\frac{1}{1+kD}\\\\, where g(D) is the discount factor that multiplies the value of the reward, D is the delay in the reward, and k is a parameter governing the degree of discounting. This is compared with the formula for exponential discounting: :f(D)=e^{-kD}\\\\, Comparison If f(D)=2^{-D}\\\\, is an exponential discounting function and g(D)=\\\\frac{1}{1+D}\\\\, a hyperbolic function (with D the number of weeks of delay), then the exponential discounting a week later from \\"now\\" (D=0) is \\\\frac{f(1)}{f(0)}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,, and the exponential discounting a week from week D is \\\\frac{f(D+1)}{f(D)}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,, which means they are the same. For g(D), \\\\frac{g(1)}{g(0)}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,, which is the same as for f, while \\\\frac{g(D+1)}{g(D)}=1-\\\\frac{1}{D+2}\\\\,. From this one can see that the two types of discounting are the same \\"now\\", but when D is much greater than 1, for instance 52 (one year), \\\\frac{g(D+1)}{g(D)}\\\\, will tend to go to 1, so that the hyperbolic discounting of a week in the far future is virtually zero, while the exponential discount factor is still 1/2, so there is still substantial discounting in the far future. =Quasi-hyperbolic approximation= The \\"quasi-hyperbolic\\" discount function, proposed by Laibson (1997), approximates the hyperbolic discount function above in discrete time by :f_{QH}(0)=1, \\\\, and :f_{QH}(D)=\\\\beta \\\\times \\\\delta^D,\\\\, where Œ≤ and Œ¥ are constants between 0 and 1; and again D is the delay in the reward, and fQH(D) is the discount factor. The condition f(0) = 1 is stating that rewards taken at the present time are not discounted. Quasi-hyperbolic time preferences are also referred to as \\"beta-delta\\" preferences. They retain much of the analytical tractability of exponential discounting while capturing the key qualitative feature of discounting with true hyperbolas. Explanations =Uncertain risks= Whether discounting future gains is rational or not‚Äîand at what rate such gains should be discounted‚Äîdepends greatly on circumstances. Many examples exist in the financial world, for example, where it is reasonable to assume that there is an implicit risk that the reward will not be available at the future date, and furthermore that this risk increases with time. Consider paying $50 for dinner today or delaying payment for sixty years but paying $100,000. In this case, the restaurateur would be reasonable to discount the promised future value as there is significant risk that it might not be paid (e.g. due to the death of the restaurateur or the diner). Uncertainty of this type can be quantified with Bayesian analysis. For example, suppose that the probability for the reward to be available after time t is, for known hazard rate Œª, :P(R_t\\\\lambda) = \\\\exp(-\\\\lambda t),\\\\, but the rate is unknown to the decision maker. If the prior probability distribution of Œª is :p(\\\\lambda) = \\\\exp(-\\\\lambda/k)/k,\\\\, then the decision maker will expect that the probability of the reward after time t is :P(R_t) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty P(R_t\\\\lambda) p(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda = \\\\frac{1}{1 + k t},\\\\, which is exactly the hyperbolic discount rate. Similar conclusions can be obtained from other plausible distributions for Œª. Applications More recently these observations about discount functions have been used to study saving for retirement, borrowing on credit cards, and procrastination. It has frequently been used to explain addiction. Hyperbolic discounting has also been offered as an explanation of the divergence between privacy attitudes and behaviour. Present values of annuities =Present value of a standard annuity= The present value of a series of equal annual cash flows in arrears discounted hyperbolically is :V = P \\\\frac{\\\\ln(1+kD)}{k},\\\\, where V is the present value, P is the annual cash flow, D is the number of annual payments and k is the factor governing the discounting. Criticism Several alternative explanations of non-exponential discounting have been proposed. An article from 2003 noted that this pattern might be better explained by a similarity heuristic than by hyperbolic discounting. Subjects have also reported changing relative preferences as they see more details of what they are choosing‚Äîa ‚Äútemporal construal‚Äù effect. A study by Daniel Read introduces \\"subadditive discounting\\": the fact that discounting over a delay increases if the delay is divided into smaller intervals. This hypothesis may explain the main finding of many studies in support of hyperbolic discounting‚Äîthe observation that impatience declines with time‚Äìwhile also accounting for observations not predicted by hyperbolic discounting. However, although these observations depart from exponential discounting, they do not entail preference reversal as time from the choice to the earlier reward increases. Arousal of appetite or emotion does sometimes lead to preference reversal, and this has been the most widely accepted alternative to a simply hyperbolic function: hyperboloid or quasi-hyperbolic discounting fuses exponential curves with an arousal bump as a visceral reward becomes imminent. Such cases are obviously important, but still do not account for cases where either both or neither choice is made during arousal. The most obvious objection to hyperbolic discounting is that many or most people learn to choose consistently over time in most situations. Similarly, a 2014 paper criticized the existing studies for mostly using data collected from university students and being too quick to conclude that the hyperbolic model of discounting is correct. Human experiments have frequently reported wide between-subject variations. If overcoming the tendency to temporary preference takes learning, the next obvious task for experimenters is to test theories of how and when this learning occurs (e.g. Ainslie, 2012).

It currently runs for 392 miles (631 km) from Blichton, Georgia at US 80 to Birmingham, Alabama at I-20/I-59. For much of its route, US 280 travels through rural areas and smaller cities in southern Georgia and east central Alabama. Once the highway approaches Birmingham, it is a major suburban route. Numerous shopping centers are located on US 280 throughout northern Shelby County and southern Jefferson County. US 280 is the main connector between Birmingham, AL and Auburn, AL. Through Talladega County, Alabama, US 280 is known as the Jim Nabors Highway, in honor of the Sylacauga, Alabama, native known for portraying the television character Gomer Pyle. The historical designation of US-280 and Alabama SR 38 is the Florida Short Route. For many years, US 280 and SR 38 was considered one of the more dangerous routes in Alabama, due to the number of large stretches of narrow two-lane roadway leading southeastwardly from Birmingham. Work was completed in 2006 making US 280 a four-lane highway throughout the entire state of Alabama. This project began in the 1970s. As a result, US 280 now bypasses numerous small towns in east Alabama, including Goodwater, Jackson's Gap, Camp Hill and Waverly.

They junction with US 11 and US 78 and climb over Red Mountain into Mtn. Brook. Here, US 280 splits off of US 31 at a highly complex interchange with elements of a Directional-T and a Parclo. It continues on somewhat of a freeway through Mtn. Brook, eventually reaching The Summit, a huge outdoor mall. It also junctions with I-459 at this point, at a Parclo-like interchange which is being modified to better suit traffic. The route continues through one of the more developed areas of east Birmingham and eventually climbs up a very slight hill into Shelby County and Chelsea. It continues east to Harpersville, which is home to its junction with US 231 north and SR 25. US 280 continues with US 231 until it reaches the Coosa River, which it crosses into Talladega County. It eventually reaches Sylacauga, which is home to its junction with US 231 south and SR 21. This specific junction is a diamond interchange, commonly used on freeways. The route continues south-east through northern Coosa County until it has another diamond interchange with SR 9. It then passes through Kellyton, which is home to its minor junction with SR 115. It crosses into Tallapoosa County just before entering Alexander City, which is home to Russell Athletic. US 280 junctions with SR 22 and SR 63 in the city. It then proceeds through slightly hilly terrain to Dadeville. It junctions with SR 49, which connects the route to the Talladega National Forest/Cheaha State Park. It leaves Dadeville, promptly enters Camp Hill, junctions with SR 50, and enters the southwestern corner of Chambers County, and then crosses into Lee County. The route then reaches The Bottle, which is named for the bright orange wooden replica of a Nehi soda bottle which stood in the location from 1924 to 1936. It crosses into Auburn, which is barely skimmed by US 280 as it then crosses into nearby Opelika. The route junctions with US 29/I-85. It joins the freeway with them and continues through I-85's junction with SR 51. It then splits off of the road with US 431. It continues on a heavily traveled road into Russell County, and eventually to Phenix City, which is actually in the Eastern Time Zone due to its close proximity with Columbus, Georgia across the Chattahoochee River. It junctions with US 80. The route then leaves US 431 behind and crosses the Chattahoochee River, leaving Alabama and entering Georgia in Columbus. US 280 has a length of in Alabama. US 280 has the unsigned designation of State Route 38 (SR 38) throughout its length in Alabama. =Georgia= US 280 begins in Georgia at the state's border with Alabama in Columbus. There it is paired with State Route 520 and U.S. Route 27. It maintains this designation as it passes through Fort Benning. Upon arriving in Cusseta, US 280/GA 520 diverge from US 27 and continue southeast to Richland, where US 280 splits off from GA 520. From here, US 280 continues on its own east, passing through Plains (the boyhood home of Jimmy Carter) and becomes cosigned with State Route 30 in Americus. US 280/SR 30 then continue east-southeast, crossing I-75 in Cordele, still continuing east through mainly rural areas of the southern portion of the state, passing through smaller towns such as McRae‚ÄìHelena, Mount Vernon, Vidalia, and Pembroke. The highway then turns to the northeast as it leaves Pembroke, crossing I-16 at exit 143. Still continuing northeast, the highway then terminates in Blichton at U.S. Route 80. =National Highway System= Except for the easternmost portion between I-16 and the eastern terminus, the entire length of US 280 is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. History Prior to the completion of the Elton B. Stephens Expressway in Birmingham, US 31, US 78, and US 280 traveled concurrently until they intersected US 11 at the intersection of 1st Avenue North and 24th Street.

Since its inception by an independent editorial collective in 1979, Social Text has addressed a wide range of social and cultural phenomena, covering questions of gender, sexuality, race, and the environment. Each issue covers subjects in the debates around feminism, Marxism, neoliberalism, postcolonialism, postmodernism, queer theory, and popular culture. The journal has since been run by different collectives over the years, mostly based at New York City universities. It has maintained an avowedly progressive political orientation and scholarship over these years, if also a less Marxist one. Since 1992, it is published by Duke University Press. The journal gained notoriety in 1996 for the Sokal affair, when it published a nonsensical article that physicist Alan Sokal had deliberately written as a hoax. The editors of the journal were awarded the 1996 Ig Nobel Prize for literature by \\"eagerly publishing research that they could not understand, that the author said was meaningless, and which claimed that reality does not exist\\". At that time, the journal did not practice academic peer review, and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.

It currently runs for 731 miles (1,175 km) from Brady, Texas at U.S. Route 87 to Lexington, Nebraska at U.S. Route 30. It passes through the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska. Route description =Texas= US 283 begins at an intersection with US 87 about three miles northwest of Brady. The highway travels through rural areas of McCulloch County before entering Coleman County. US 283 maintains its rural route through Coleman County before entering the town of Santa Anna, beginning an overlap with US 84. The two highways travel northwest together to the town of Coleman before they split. US 283 returns to a rural route once again and intersects State Highway 36 in southern Callahan County. The highway runs through the town of Baird where it crosses Interstate 20. US 283 next enters the town of Albany and shares a short overlap with US 180/State Highway 6. Just south of Throckmorton the highway begins its lengthy overlap with US 183. The two highways travel to Seymour and begin an overlap with US 277 and US 82. US 183/283 leave US 82/277 in the town of Mabelle. US 183 leaves US 283 in Vernon at US 287/US 70. US 283 travels in a slight northwest direction and crosses over the Red River into Oklahoma. In Texas, US-283 originally went southeast from Albany via Cisco, Rising Star, and Brownwood to end at Brady. In 1951, this route became US 380 (later SH 6), US 183, and US 377. It was rerouted to its current routing between Albany and Brady in 1951, replacing the old route of US 183. Fort Griffin State Historic Site, north of Albany, Texas. =Oklahoma= US-283 enters Oklahoma from Texas in rural Jackson County at a crossing of the Red River. It runs concurrently with State Highway 5 for several miles past Elmer and continues north to Altus, the largest Oklahoma town on the route. At the intersection of U.S. Highway 62 in Altus, SH-5 splits off and 283 joins with State Highway 6 for the next before it takes a western bend to the town of Mangum. The route continues northwesterly until it crosses I-40 at Sayre. Through northwestern Oklahoma, US-283 passes through very sparsely populated areas and is the main north-south traffic corridor. After passing through Cheyenne, 283 meanders through Black Kettle National Grassland then crosses the Canadian River. It continues north to Arnett where it joins with State Highway 51 west for then turns north again passing through Shattuck and Laverne following part of State Highway 15 along the way. North of Laverne, 283 turns west for to visit the town of Rosston then turns north again to cross the Cimarron River shortly before leaving the state for Kansas. Some points of interest along US-283 in Oklahoma include the Museum of the Western Prairie in Altus; the Old Greer County Museum in Mangum; Black Kettle National Grassland and the Washita Battlefield National Historic Site near Cheyenne and the Shattuck Windmill Museum. =Kansas= US-283 enters from Oklahoma south of Englewood in Clark County, and passes through largely unpopulated areas of the county until joining up for a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 160. Following the split, US-283 continues north through Minneola before making its way into Dodge City, the only town with a population of more than 3,300 the highway passes through in the Sunflower State. At Dodge City, US-283 jogs east. It meets with U.S. Route 400, but the two highways do not stay joined for long; US-400 splits and heads southeast towards Greensburg, while US-283 continues eastbound past the Dodge City Regional Airport. After passing the airport, the route then bends northeast before joining U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 56 for a brief stint. US-50 and US-56 split east towards Kinsley, and US-283 resumes a due northerly course through open fields before reaching Jetmore, where K-156 crosses in an east-west direction. K-156 heads to Garden City westbound and Great Bend eastbound. The highway continues on another stretch through sparsely populated farmland before reaching Ness City and K-96, the first of two junctions in Ness County. The other junction in the county is at K-4 near Ransom. The highway reaches Interstate 70 in WaKeeney, and makes a brief jog east through downtown WaKeeney before turning back to the north. US-283 between Ransom and I-70 was closed for much of 2006 as part of a major reconstruction program. The highway continues north to Hill City, where it crosses U.S. Route 24. The route stays on course until it reaches southern Norton County, where it has a brief concurrency with K-9. At the split, K-9 continues west to Lenora, and US-283 resumes a straight northerly direction until the city of Norton, where after crossing U.S. Route 36, it reaches Nebraska later. With the exception of small sections in Dodge City, all portions of US-283 in Kansas are two-laned. =Nebraska= U.S. Highway 283 enters Nebraska south of Arapahoe. At Arapahoe, US 283 meets U.S. Highway 6 and U.S. Highway 34. It continues north through Elwood, then turns northeast. Near Lexington, US 283 crosses the Platte River and intersects Interstate 80. It continues north into Lexington as a divided highway, turns back to a 2 lane road, crosses the Union Pacific railroad tracks via an overpass, and after taking 2 right turns on city streets, it ends at an intersection with U.S. Highway 30.

Being a major industrial, financial and educational center, it is a major producer of industrialized food products. Considered a medium city, with a population estimated at 213,279 inhabitants, it is among the four most important cities in the state. It belongs to the Meso-region of Western Santa Catarina and to the Microregion of Chapec√≥. Distant 550 km from the state capital, Florian√≥polis, it is Headquarters of the Metropolitan Region of Chapec√≥, and exerts significant influence not only in the Catarinense West but also in the Northwest Rio Grande do Sul and Southwest of Paran√°, from an economic, cultural, or political point of view. Chapec√≥ became known worldwide through its association football club Chapecoense and the aftermath of LaMia Flight 2933 which killed 71, including most of the team's roster and staff. With the titles of \\"Brazil's agribusiness capital\\" and \\"Brazil's business tourism capital\\", the planned town constructed in the form of a chess grid also has universities attracting students from all over Brazil. The main educational institutions are UFFS, UNOCHAPEC√ì, UNOESC and UDESC.  History  Until the 19th century, the area around Chapec√≥ land was under indigenous (mainly Kaingang) and Spanish control, mostly unoccupied by European people and subject to border issues and armed conflicts. Brazilian control was in fact established as a military colony in 1882. Its official status as a municipality was established by state government decree after the Contestado War on August 25, 1917. Its area was then given to a private colonization company which began selling land to people coming mainly from the neighboring state of Rio Grande do Sul. Most of its inhabitants are descended from Italian, German and Polish immigrants.  Demography  Buildings in the central part of the city in 2017 The region has always been the subject of disputes because of its strategic importance as a border region. During the Contestado War, airplanes were used for the first time in the history of America for the purpose of recognition and support for war operations. Colonized by Italian and German immigrants, mainly from Rio Grande do Sul, Paran√°, S√£o Paulo and the coast of Santa Catarina, the city today attracts several inhabitants thanks to its development. It is one of the cities with the highest number (in percentage) of buildings in Santa Catarina. According to the IBGE, Chapec√≥ has almost 16% of its population living in apartments, gaining in percentage of cities such as Joinville, Itaja√≠ and Blumenau.  Economy  327x327px This region of the state is home of some of the largest meat processing and exporting industrial enterprises such as Sadia and Seara Foods; the farmers are organized in agricultural cooperatives. Chapec√≥ is known as a Brazilian agro-industrial capital, specialized in pork, poultry and technology involved. The city is headquarters of Aurora Central Cooperative and has a plant of BRF S.A. since 1973. Other major economic sectors are metal mechanics specialized in equipment for slaughterhouses and transportation, plastics and packaging, furniture, beverages, software development and biotechnology. Civil construction and trade are also important source of income. Chapec√≥ is served by Serafin Enoss Bertaso Airport. Culture =Sports= Football is the great passion of the Chapecoenses. The Chapecoense Football Association, known among its fans as a \\"Hurricane from the west\\", Chape and verd√£o, a team from Santa Catarina, has as its last title the Campeonato Catarinense de Futebol de 2017 - S√©rie A. Its headquarters is in Arena Cond√°m, with a capacity of over 22,000 people and located in the East Zone of the city. The team had spent three consecutive years in the C Series of the Brazilian Championship (2010, 2011 and 2012), before beginning a rapid rise through the Brazilian football pyramid by reaching the second division in 2013 and entering the Serie A Brasileir√£o in 2014, where it currently resides. The team was among the best teams in South America, reaching the quarterfinals of the 2015 Copa Sudamericana and reaching the final of the 2016 Copa Sudamericana. On November 29, 2016, Chapecoense team members and staff boarded LaMia Flight 2933 to play the first leg of the 2016 Copa Sudamericana Finals against Atl√©tico Nacional in Medell√≠n, Colombia. The plane crashed in the mountains a few miles south of the city. Seventy-one of the seventy-seven people on board died, including all of the club's coaching staff and all but three of the players. A wave of commotion abated in the football world in the days and weeks after, playing tribute to the club; Atl√©tico Nacional requested that CONMEBOL, the governing football association for South America, award the 2016 title to Chapecoense, which was granted.

It currently runs for 322 miles (518 km) from Provo, Utah at Interstate 15 to Jackson, Wyoming. The highway was not part of the original 1926 U.S. Highway system. The highway was created in the 1930s, absorbing former U.S. Route 530 and a portion of U.S. Route 30S. The portion through Provo Canyon (between Provo and Heber City, Utah) has been designated the Provo Canyon Scenic Byway by the state of Utah. Route description =Utah= Provo Canyon, US-189 is visible in the bottom of the photo US-189 begins in Provo where it is known as University Avenue, referring to Brigham Young University. The highway then winds up Provo Canyon passing by Deer Creek Reservoir and paralleling the route of the Heber Creeper (now known as the Heber Valley Railroad). The portion in Provo Canyon is designated the Provo Canyon Scenic Byway by the state legislature. The highway exits Provo Canyon near Heber City, Utah. At Heber City US-189 meets U.S. Route 40 and is co-signed with Route 40 all the way to its junction with I-80. Prior to the construction of the Jordanelle Reservoir, the highway continued north concurrent with the former alignment of US-40 that is now under water. US-40 and 189 separated at Hailstone, also now under the lake. US-189 emerged from the lake shore along the route now signed State Route 32. SR-32 and former US-189 join I-80 in Wanship. Prior to the completion of Interstate 80 in eastern Utah US-189 formed the main streets of Coalville and other communities now bypassed by I-80. The Utah section of US-189 is defined in Utah Code Annotated ¬ß 72-4-124(2). The Utah Code does not contain the concurrent alignment along US-40 and I-80, but the concurrent portion is included in Utah Department of Transportation maps of the area. =Wyoming= US 189 enters Wyoming from the west co-routed with Interstate 80. The routes separate east of Evanston, where US 189 proceeds north to the Jackson Hole area. At Hoback Junction, south of Jackson, US 189 rejoins its parent route, US 89. History There was a US-189 in the initial 1926 plan for U.S. Highways, which ran from Nephi to Pigeon Hollow Junction. This route is currently the eastern half of State Route 132. In 1938, a second iteration of US 189 was created using several state routes. The portion from Provo to Heber City in Utah was numbered State Route 7. Although signed US-189 starting in 1938 this road retained the SR-7 designation until 1977. US-189 replaced US-530, designated in 1926, between the modern junctions of I-80 with US-40 at Silver Creek Junction and I-84 at Echo. Between Echo and Evanston, Wyoming US-189 was originally concurrent with US-30S. As portions of I-80 were complete, US-189 was moved from the old US-30S alignment to the freeway alignment. Prior to the construction of the Jordanelle Reservoir, the US-189 designation alternated between two routes between Hailstone and Wanship. For most of this era, US-189 was routed along what is now State Route 32 via Kamas. However, there are some years the official Utah Highway Map shows the road through Kamas designated as US-189 Alternate, with the main route of US-189 concurrent with the routes of US-40 and what is now I-80. In 1985 the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) began plans to relocate US-40 and US-189 to prepare for the construction of the Jordanelle Reservoir. As late as 1989, UDOT still intended move US-189 to an alignment on the northern shore of the proposed reservoir. On January 18, 1990 the Federal Highway Administration sent a letter to UDOT recommending that US-189 not be moved to this new alignment. The stated reason was this new routing would result in traveling \\"out-of-direction\\". AASHTO agreed, and authorized a change of plan for the route of US-189 to run concurrent with US-40. UDOT agreed, and this new road was instead signed as extension of State Route 248. The portion of the former route of US-189 not submerged by the new lake was designated State Route 32 after months of negotiations with county officials. However, although US-189 was now officially concurrent with US-40 between Heber City and Silver Creek Junction, this segment was signed only as US-40, and an \\"END US-189\\" sign was posted in Heber City. This lasted until late 2017, when the end signs were removed and US-189 signs were added to the US-40 concurrency. US-189 remains unsigned on the I-80 concurrency between Silver Creek Junction and the Wyoming state line.

It was written by Marti Noxon and first broadcast on February 10, 1998. In this episode, Cordelia breaks up with Xander after her friends mock her. Xander retaliates by attempting a love spell to \\"put her through the same hell\\", and he gets a little more than he had bargained for. Plot During a patrol through the cemetery, Xander shows Buffy a silver necklace he intends to give to Cordelia the following night for Valentine's Day. The next day at school, Xander witnesses Amy Madison use magic to avoid a homework assignment. Soon after, Giles runs into Jenny Calendar; however, their relationship remains frosty, with Giles deciding talking to Buffy is more important than making amends with Jenny. Giles warns Buffy that Angelus becomes particularly vicious around Valentine's Day, and suggests she stays indoors for the following nights. Meanwhile, Cordelia is insulted by Harmony and the Cordettes, revealing to Cordelia that her relationship with Xander is not as secret as she once thought. Xander gives the necklace to Cordelia, but she breaks up with him under pressure from her friends. Xander is heartbroken, and blackmails Amy into casting a love spell upon Cordelia so he can take revenge by breaking up with her. However, as he intended to use the spell for revenge rather than its true purpose, the magic goes wrong, with Cordelia becoming the only female not to be affected by the spell (protected by her necklace). The following day, Xander is shocked to find Cordelia repels his advances, and retreats to the library. Buffy makes it clear that she is attracted to Xander, but Amy interrupts them and tells Xander she believes the spell went wrong. She begins to act similarly to Buffy, so Xander rushes home and finds Willow in his bed, where she attempts to seduce him. The following day, all of the girls of Sunnydale High obsessively start following Xander around the corridors and Harmony criticises a shocked Cordelia for breaking up with Xander. Xander seeks help from Giles, who is appalled by Xander's foolishness. Giles goes looking for Amy, so that she can reverse the spell, while Xander barricades himself in the library. However, Buffy gets in and attempts to seduce a reluctant Xander. Amy also arrives, and becomes jealous of Buffy, ultimately casting a spell that changes Buffy into a rat. An angry Giles orders Xander to go home, while he attempts to make Amy reverse the spells. Oz looks for the Buffy-rat to ensure that she is not hurt. As Xander is leaving the school, he finds the spell is becoming stronger and more uncontrollable. He saves Cordelia from an attack by Harmony and a group of girls. Xander and Cordelia seek shelter in Buffy's home, locking Joyce out when she too falls under the spell. While in Buffy's room, Xander is pulled out of the window by Angelus, who intends to kill him to upset Buffy. Xander is saved by an infatuated Drusilla. Xander barricades himself in the basement with Cordelia, who is touched to learn that Xander performed the spell for her. The love-crazed mob breaks in and attacks Xander and Cordelia just as Giles and Amy manage to lift the spell.

Oz and Willow have their first date, commencing one of the longest relationships on the show. Oz also learns about the supernatural forces that plague Sunnydale (which he easily takes in his stride, remarking that it actually explains a lot). Angel loses his soul and reverts to the evil and sadistic Angelus, the Big Bad of Season 2. Jenny's hidden motives are revealed. Spike and Dru are established as worthy adversaries, allowing for Spike's eventual return appearances in Seasons 3 and 4, and for his permanent membership as regular cast for Seasons 5, 6 and 7. * Buffy's birthday gift from Angel, her claddagh ring, not only comes to signify her lost love for the rest of Season 2, but also plays an important part in the beginning of Season 3, first as a resonant antecedent to Scott Hope's impromptu gift, and then as a mystical focus for Angel's return from Acathla's hell dimension. = Continuity = *As revealed in this episode and confirmed in later episodes, Buffy's birthday is in late January, making her a Capricorn on the cusp of Aquarius. The cusp day of Capricorn and Aquarius is the 20th of January, the air date of the following episode. *In the first dream, Willow says to a monkey, \\"L'hippo a piqu√© ton pantalon\\" (French: \\"The hippo stole your trousers\\"). This refers back to her conversation with Oz near the end of \\"What's My Line, Part Two,\\" in which, intentionally absurd, he wonders if the hippo animal cracker is jealous because the monkey is the only animal cracker with pants, and asserts, \\"All monkeys are French.\\" = Cultural references = * Snakes-in-a-can: Xander references a popular practical joke. * Denny's: Xander's fantasy harks back to Cordelia's repeated predictions that he himself is slated for a brilliant career as a pizza delivery boy. * Faust: Angel losing his soul because he attains a moment of pure happiness is reminiscent of the German legend about Faust, a scholar who made a deal with the devil. In gaining all worldly things he agreed that, in return, if he ever attained a moment of pure happiness his soul would forever serve the devil. Production details Brian Thompson, who played the Judge, also played Luke in \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\". Both episodes were two-parters in which his character died in the second part. \\"Surprise\\" was the final episode to air on Monday nights on The WB. Together with \\"Innocence,\\" the show moved from Mondays to Tuesdays as a lead-in for The WB's then-newest debuting series Dawson's Creek. Both Buffy and Dawson's Creek went on to become two of the network's signature series.

It was written and directed by Joss Whedon and first broadcast on January 20, 1998. It is part two of a two-part story. Part one, \\"Surprise\\". was broadcast the day before. \\"Innocence\\" is one of the most critically acclaimed and highest rated episodes in the series, attracting 8.2 million viewers as the series moved from its Monday timeslot to Tuesday. Plot After making love with Buffy, Angel is racked with pain as his soul is ripped from him. In the street, he kills a passer-by when she offers to help him. He goes to the factory to join Spike and Drusilla, but the Judge attacks him. It is unable to burn him because Angel has fully reverted to the evil Angelus. Spike, Drusilla, and Angelus are clearly pleased to be reunited. Angelus vows to destroy Buffy for how she made him feel when he was Angel. While researching a way to defeat the Judge, a demon with the power to destroy the world whom \\"no weapon forged\\" can harm, Xander and Cordelia are caught kissing in the library by a jealous Willow. Buffy finds Angel in his apartment, not knowing that he is now Angelus, and he blows her off, laughing at her as she weeps. Jenny is castigated by her uncle Enyos, who tells her that if Angel has one moment of true happiness, the curse placed on him will be broken and his new soul taken from him. Angelus terrorizes Willow and the Gang at school, emotionally tormenting Buffy. Later, as they discuss Angel's transformation in the library, Buffy realises that having sex with Angel is what caused him to turn evil. Buffy has a dream in which Angel indicates that Jenny knows more than she is letting on. The next morning Buffy confronts Jenny who tells her that Angelus was cursed with a soul in vengeance for what he did to her people, and that Enyos had tasked her with keeping Buffy and Angel apart. When Buffy, Jenny, and Giles arrive at Enyos' home, they find that Angelus has brutally killed him, leaving Buffy a message written in blood on the wall. Buffy begins to accept that she has to kill Angelus. Xander, using memories from being a soldier on Halloween, hatches a plan to kill the Judge. He and Cordelia break into an army base and steal a shoulder-launched rocket. Oz declines Willow's offer to make out, as he suspects that she only wants to make Xander jealous. Tracking down the Judge, who is slaughtering people at a crowded mall, Buffy blows him to bits with the anti-tank weapon. Buffy stalks Angelus through the fleeing crowd and, when he ambushes her, they battle ferociously. Reaching a stand-off, Buffy is still unwilling to kill Angelus and settles for kicking him in the crotch. Buffy blames herself for everything that has happened, but Giles reassures her that although she acted rashly, she and Angel loved each other and that Giles still supports and respects her. Later, Joyce lights the candle on Buffy's birthday cake and tells her to make a wish, but Buffy decides to let it burn, while they watch the classic movie Stowaway. Writing In the commentary, when Joss Whedon is asked about his decision to turn Angel evil, he said that he feels it was necessary to keep the story fresh as viewers would quickly become bored with Angel and Buffy's relationship. Although the fan base wanted Buffy and Angel to be together romantically, Whedon says, \\"What people want is not what they need.\\" In the DVD commentary, Whedon says the interaction between Buffy and Angel following their night of passion was supposed to have taken place outside of Buffy's house. However, he comments that the scene was simply not working as it was lacking intimacy and was thus later shot in Angel's house. =Arc significance= * This is the first instance where Xander reveals he has retained military knowledge after the events of the Halloween episode. *Willow learns of Xander's and Cordelia's relationship.

Background Pearse, generally known as a leader of the Easter Rising in 1916, had long been critical of the educational system in Ireland, which he believed taught Irish children to be good Englishmen. He had for years been committed to the preservation of the Irish language, mostly through the Gaelic League, and was dearly concerned about the language's future. A trip abroad to Belgium and his observations of bi-lingual education there inspired him to attempt a similar experiment at home. Pearse also simply liked boys and wanted to spend time with them, writing: \\"To me a boy is the most interesting of all living things, and I have for years found myself coveting the privilege of being in a position to mould or help to mould, the lives of boys to noble ends.\\".http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n07/colm-toibin/after-i-am-hanged-my-portrait- will-be-interesting Pearse was not a practical businessman, but he was never one to let lack of finances get in the way of his plans. With promises from prominent nationalists as proponents of Irish heritage that they would give him whatever limited financial support they could, and, when applicable, would enroll their children in his school, Pearse established his school, which officially opened on 8 September 1908, in Cullenswood House, Ranelagh, a suburb of Dublin.Sisson, Elaine. Pearse's Patriots: St Enda's and the Cult of Boyhood. Cork, Cork University Press, 2004. (p.20). The school proved a successful experiment, but was never to fully escape the shadow of looming financial woes. In fact, the school would not have survived the crucial first few years without the devoted aid of his good friend and assistant headmaster Thomas MacDonagh, and the solid dedication of Pearse's brother Willie. Move to Rathfarnham St. Enda's taught many of the classes in Irish, and particularly stressed the arts and dramatics. Everything was given an Irish approach. After two years the school was doing quite well. At this point, when most people would work on more fully establishing the school and perhaps working on an endowment, Pearse instead got more ambitious. Thrilled with his creation, and concerned that Cullenswood House was not a location that did St. Enda's justice, Pearse found what he believed to be the perfect home for the school. The Hermitage in Rathfarnham, substantially further from Dublin than Cullenswood House, caught his imagination and he decided that the school would have to move there. The substantial extra expenses involved did not deter him, nor was anything likely to, for the Hermitage, in addition to having a majestic pastoral setting, had a connection with Robert Emmet, an Irish martyr and hero of Pearse's. It was on the same grounds that he had courted his love Sarah Curran, who had lived nearby and whose father did not look kindly on young Emmet, forcing them to the nearby grounds of the nearby Hermitage for their trysts. In addition, the school's namesake, St. Enda of Aran, had similarly left his life to teach a devoted group of students in the secluded Aran Islands, much as Pearse was now to do. In 1910 St. Enda's opened its doors at the Hermitage. The Hermitage, while perfect for Pearse's idyllic image of what he had hoped to achieve, proved to be a financial disaster. The extra distance made it less practical for the day school boys, forcing many of them to drop out, with not enough making the switch to boarders. In addition to this school, Pearse had decided to use Cullenswood House to establish a similar school for girls, St. Ita's. With bankruptcy looming Pearse was forced to look to the United States for further funding. A lecture tour gave him some good contacts among the exiled Fenians who would prove to play a large part in Ireland's near political future, but the money he raised only kept the school barely in solvency. Later years and closure Pearse was a person who would show extreme dedication to a project once it caught his interest, but this left him unable to fully devote himself to multiple tasks. His involvement in the Irish Volunteers in 1913, and his active participation in the Irish Republican Brotherhood shortly thereafter, left St. Enda's with a less devoted master than it had previously. Pearse's radical politics also made even some moderate supporters question what their children might be exposed to, and some, notably Eoin MacNeill, removed their children from Pearse's influence. As it turned out, a large number of St. Enda's pupils did join the Fianna √âireann, and even the IRB, fifteen of whom later took part in the Easter Rising in 1916. Following the execution of the Pearse brothers after the rising, their mother reopened St. Enda's back at Cullenwood House, which the closure of St. Ita's had vacated. Frank Burke, an ex-pupil who had served in the Rising, was headmaster. The school returned to the Hermitage in 1919. The international fame the rising had given Pearse and his martyrdom made raising funds easier than before, and the following year Margaret Pearse had raised enough to buy the property Pearse could never afford in his lifetime. However, without the leadership of either of the Pearse brothers, St. Enda's could not last, and it eventually closed its doors for good in 1935. Today the Hermitage stands as the Pearse Museum, dedicated to the memory of the school's founder. Notes Further reading * Sisson, Elaine.

This effect has been demonstrated in numerous experiments using different methods. It is based on the notion that \\"human memory is extremely sensitive to the symbolic modality of presentation of event information\\". Explanations for the picture superiority effect are not concrete and are still being debated.  History  Allan Paivio's dual-coding theory is a basis of picture superiority effect. Paivio claims that pictures have advantages over words with regards to coding and retrieval of stored memory because pictures are coded more easily and can be retrieved from symbolic mode, while the dual coding process using words is more difficult for both coding and retrieval. Another explanation of the higher recall in picture superiority is due to the higher familiarity or frequency of pictured objects (Asch & Ebenholtz, 1962). According to dual-coding theory (1971, 1986), memory exists either (or both) verbally or through imagery. Concrete concepts presented as pictures are encoded into both systems; however, abstract concepts are recorded only verbally. In psychology, the effect has implications for salience in attribution theory as well as the availability heuristic. It is also relevant to advertising and user interface design. Related theories =Paivio ‚Äì Dual coding theory= Picture stimuli have an advantage over word stimuli because they are dually encoded; they generate a verbal and image code, whereas word stimuli only generate a verbal code. Pictures are likely to generate a verbal label, whereas words are not likely to generate image labels. =Nelson ‚Äì Sensory semantic theory= Pictures hold two encoding advantages over words. Pictures are perceptually more distinct from one another than are words, thus increasing their chance for retrieval. In experiments when similarity among pictures was high, no picture superiority effect was present. Pictures are also believed to assess meaning more directly than words. Levels of processing theory apply when words and pictures are compared under semantic study instructions (rate the pleasantness of each item), recall is very similar for pictures and words, as both were encoded at deeper levels. Picture superiority results from superior encoding for pictures as opposed to words, which facilitate greater recollection for pictures. = Weldon and Roediger-transfer appropriate processing theories = Greater overlap of processing at study and test result in increased performance. TAP accounts for picture superiority by an interaction of encoding and retrieval. If items are encoded during a semantic task, performance should be higher for a memory test that relies on concepts related to the items for retrieval than a test that relies on perceptual features. Evidence This effect has been shown to occur in recognition memory tasks, where items studied as pictures are better remembered than items studied as words, even when targets are presented as words during the test phase. Whether the picture superiority effect influences the familiarity and/or recollection processes, according to the dual-process models, thought to underlie recognition memory is not clear. In experiments of associative recognition memory, participants studied random concrete word pairs, and line drawing pairs. They had to discriminate between intact and rearranged pairs at test. The picture superiority effect continued to express a strong effect with a greater hit rate for intact picture pairs. This further supports encoding theories More recent research in associative recognition shows support that semantic meaning of nameable pictures is activated faster than that of words, allowing for more meaningful associations between items depicted as pictures to be generated. Pictures have distinctive features that enable to distinguish pictures from words and such discriminability increase memory ability in comparison with verbal cues (Jenkins, Neale & Deno, 19 67). Picture Superiority effect was also evident for memory recall during semantic procession (Childers & Houston, 1984). Moreover, pictures in pairs or group were better organized in our memory than words thus resulting in superiority in recall (Pavio & Csapo, 1973). The picture superiority effect is also present in spatial memory, where locations of items and photographs were remembered better than locations of words.  Critique  The advantage of pictures over words is only evident when visual similarity is not a reliable cue; because it takes longer to understand pictures than words (Snodgrass & McCullough, 1986). Pictures are only superior to words for list learning because differentiation is easier for pictures (Dominowski & Gadlin, 1968). In reverse picture superiority it was observed that learning was much slower when the responses were pictures (Postman, 1978). Words produced a faster response than pictures and pictures did not have an advantages of having easier access to semantic memory or superior effect over words for dual-coding theory (Amrhein, McDaniel & Waddill 2002). Similarly, studies where response time deadlines have been implemented, the reverse superiority effect was reported. This is related to the dual-process model of familiarity and recollection. When deadlines for the response were short, the process of familiarity was present, along with an increased tendency to recall words over pictures. When response deadlines were longer, the process of recollection was being utilized, and a strong picture superiority effect was present. In addition, equivalent response time was reported for pictures and words for intelligence comparison (Paivio & Marschark, 1980). Contrary to the assumption that pictures have faster access to the same semantic code than words do; all semantic information is stored in a single system. The only difference is that pictures and words access different features of the semantic code (te Linde, 1982). With age Across the lifespan, a gradual development of the picture superiority effect is evident. Some studies have shown that it appears to become more pronounced with age, while others have found that this effect is also observed among younger children (Whitehouse, Mayber, Durkin, 2006). However, the major contribution in picture superiority in recognition memory among children was familiarity (Defeyter, Russo & McPartlin, 2009). During childhood, specifically among seven-year-olds, the picture superiority effect is lesser in magnitude than in other age groups. This could be due to the lack of inner speech among younger children supporting the dual coding theory of Paivio. In healthy older adults, the picture superiority effect was found to be greater than it was for younger adults, in comparison to recognition for words, which was disadvantaged for older adults. In that regard, seniors can benefit from using pictorial information to retain textual information (Cherry et al., 2008). While memory for words is impaired for older adults, pictures help restore their impaired memory and function properly (Ally et al., 2008). In addition, older adults have shown the same level of capability for identifying correct items in comparison with young adults when items were accompanied with pictures (Smith, Hunt & Dunlap, 2015). In populations with Alzheimer's disease, and other mild cognitive impairments, the picture superiority effect remains evident. ERP activity indicates that patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment utilized frontal-lobe based memory processes to support successful recognition for pictures, which was similar to healthy controls, but not for words.  Applications  * Education (language learning): Learners can structure a mental model when processing a picture initially so that no further model construction may be required for subsequent processing of a text. Presenting picture before text is beneficial to students with low prior knowledge (Eitel & Scheiter, 2015). In a similar vein, reading a picture prior to processing textual information improves comprehension levels for students with low prior knowledge (Salmer√≥n, Baccino, Ca√±as, Madrid, & Fajardo, 2009). Pictures can be more effective than word translation for language learning when individuals are not overconfident in the mnemonic power of pictures (Carpenter & Olson, 2011). If they are overconfident, pictures lose superiority over words. * Health communication: A study by Ally, Gold and Budson (2009) confirm that picture superiority effect was observed among mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic-type mild cognitive impairment (MC). Pictures have a significantly positive effect on four areas of communication: attention, comprehension, recall, and intention/adherence. Health education materials can benefit greatly by adding pictures as pictures can be especially beneficial for people who lack literacy skill (Houts, C.Doak, L.Doak &Loscalzo;, 2006). Picture superiority effect can be implemented in creating materials for health communication that inclusion of fearful or disgusting images led to improved recognition memory in comparison with the condition without a presence of image (Leshner, Vultee, Bolls & Moore, 2010). *Advertising: Percy and Rossiter (1997, p. 295) stated, \\"The picture is the most important structural element in magazine advertising, for both consumer and business audiences.\\" Visually framed messages were more effective under the condition where the audience was less motivated and had less ability to process information semantically. Visual ads require less exposure than verbal ads for long-term memory effect (Childers & Houston, 1984). The pictorial component in the ad is more likely to be viewed before words, and it generates an expectation for the verbal component of the ad (Houston, Childers & Heckler, 1987). Maximizing the size of pictures regardless of advertising contents will improve attention to the entire advertisement as pictures draw significant attention to baseline in the ads (Pieters & Wedel, 2004).

Testing and evaluation Undertaking its maiden flight on 22 December 1936 at Mines Field in Los Angeles, test flights indicated a number of minor problems.Rusinek 2005 Modifications resolving these resulted in the aircraft being re-designated NA-39, and, accepted by the US Army Air Corps as the XB-21. The aircraft, which had been assigned the serial number 38-485, was evaluated early the following year in competition against a similar design by Douglas Aircraft, an improved version of the company's successful B-18 Bolo. During the course of flight testing, the gun turrets proved troublesome, their drive motors proving to be underpowered, and issues with wind blast through the gun slots were also encountered. As a result of these problems, the XB-21's nose turret was faired over, while the dorsal turret was removed. The XB-21 proved to have superior performance over its competitor, but price became the primary factor distinguishing the Bolo and the XB-21. On this account, the modified B-18 was declared the winner of the competition, Douglas quoting a price per aircraft of US$64,000, while North American's estimate was US$122,000 per aircraft, and an order was placed for 177 of the Douglas aircraft, to be designated B-18A. Despite this, the US Army Air Corps found the performance of the XB-21 to have been favorable enough to order five pre-production aircraft, to be designated YB-21. However, soon after this contract was awarded, it was cancelled, and none of the YB-21s were ever built, leaving the XB-21 as the sole example of the type ever constructed. Operated by North American Aviation, the XB-21 served as a research aircraft until its retirement. Although the XB-21 failed to win a production contract, it was the first of a long line of North American Aviation medium bomber aircraft, and provided experience and knowledge that assisted in the development of the North American NA-40,Yenne 2006, p. 87. which, developed into the B-25 Mitchell, would become one of the Army's standard medium bombers of World War II.Donald 1997, p. 697.

The theory was coined by German psychiatrist and pediatrician Hedwig von Restorff (1906‚Äì1962), who, in her 1933 study, found that when participants were presented with a list of categorically similar items with one distinctive, isolated item on the list, memory for the item was improved. The study utilized the isolation paradigm, which refers to a distinctive feature of an item in a list that differs from the others by way of dimension. Such distinctiveness, leading to the von Restorff effect, can be generated from changing the meaningfulness or physical nature of the stimulus in some way, such as in size, shape, color, spacing and underlining.  Examples  For example, if a person examines a shopping list with one item highlighted in bright green, he or she will be more likely to remember the highlighted item than any of the others. Additionally, in the following list of words ‚Äì desk, chair, bed, table, chipmunk, dresser, stool, couch ‚Äì \\"chipmunk\\" will be remembered the most as it stands out against the other words in its meaning.  Explanation  There are different theories proposed to explain the increased performance of isolated items. The total- time hypothesis suggests that isolated items are rehearsed for a longer time in working memory compared to non-isolated items. Another approach offers that subjects could consider the isolated items to be in their own special category in a free-recall task, making them easier to recollect. A separate explanation is based upon the analysis of the deep processing of similarities and differences among the items. Debate surrounds whether perceptual salience and differential attention are necessary to produce this effect. Modern theory holds that the contextual incongruity of the isolate is what leads to the differential attention to this item. Based on this assumption, an isolation effect would not be expected if the isolated item were presented prior to some consistent context, a theory that goes against von Restorff's findings. Empirical data has shown a strong relationship between the von Restorff effect and measures of event-related potential in the brain. Specifically, evidence has shown that exposure to novel or isolated items on a list for free recall generates an ERP with a larger amplitude and this amplitude in turn predicts a higher likelihood of future recall and faster recognition of the items. Age There have been many studies that demonstrate and confirm the von Restorff effect in children and young adults. Another study found that college-aged students performed better when trying to remember an outstanding item in a list during an immediate memory-task whereas elderly individuals did not remember it well, suggesting a difference in processing strategies between the age groups. In yet another study, although a significant von Restorff effect was produced amongst both age groups when manipulating font color, it was found to be smaller in older adults than younger adults. This too indicates that older people display lesser benefits for distinctive information compared to younger people.

The defining characteristics of a vulnerable plaque include but are not limited to: a thin fibrous cap, large lipid-rich necrotic core, increased plaque inflammation, positive vascular remodeling, increased vasa-vasorum neovascularization, and intra- plaque hemorrhage. These characteristics together with the usual hemodynamic pulsating expansion during systole and elastic recoil contraction during diastole contribute to a high mechanical stress zone on the fibrous cap of the atheroma, making it prone to rupture. Increased hemodynamic stress, e.g. increased blood pressure, especially pulse pressure (systolic blood pressure vs. diastolic blood pressure difference), correlates with increased rates of major cardiovascular events associated with exercise, especially exercise beyond levels the individual does routinely. Generally an atheroma becomes vulnerable if it grows more rapidly and has a thin cover separating it from the bloodstream inside the arterial lumen. Tearing of the cover is called plaque rupture. Repeated atheroma rupture and healing is one of the mechanisms, perhaps the dominant one, that creates artery stenosis. Formation Researchers have found that accumulation of white blood cells, especially macrophages, termed inflammation, in the walls of the arteries leads to the development of \\"soft\\" or vulnerable plaque, which when released aggressively promotes blood clotting. Researchers now think that vulnerable plaque, (see atherosclerosis) is formed in the following way: * Hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking, homocysteine, hemodynamic factors, toxins, viruses, and/or immune reactions results in chronic endothelial injury, dysfunction, and increased permeability. *Lipoprotein LDL particles, which carry fats (including the fat cholesterol made by every human cell) within the water/plasma portion of the blood stream, are absorbed into the intima, past the endothelium lining, some of the LDL-lipoprotein particles become oxidized and this attracts macrophages that uptake the particles. This process typically starts in childhood. To be specific: oxidized lipoprotein particles in the artery wall are an irritant which causes the release of proteins (called cytokines) which attract monocyte white blood cells (white blood cells are the inflammatory cells within the body). * The cytokines induce the endothelial cells lining the artery wall to display adhesion molecules that attract immune-system white blood cells (to be specific, monocytes). * The monocytes squeeze into the artery wall. Once inside, they transform into macrophages which will ingest the oxidized lipoprotein particles. * The macrophages sometimes become so overloaded with oxidized lipoprotein particles, the cholesterol contained therein and membrane-laden that they are called foam cells. Some of these cells die in place, releasing their fat and cholesterol-laden membranes into the intercellular space. This attracts more macrophages and smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. *Smooth muscle cells migrate from the media to the intima, proliferate, and develop an extracellular matrix made up of collagen and proteoglycans. * In some regions of increased macrophage activity, macrophage-induced-enzymes erode away the fibrous membrane beneath the endothelium so that the cover separating the plaque from blood flow in the lumen becomes thin and fragile. * Mechanical stretching and contraction of the artery, with each heart beat, i.e. the pulse, results in rupture of the thin covering membrane, spewing clot-promoting plaque contents into the blood stream. * The clotting system reacts and forms clots both on the particles shed into the blood stream and locally over the rupture. The clot, if large enough, can block all blood flow. Since all the blood, within seconds, passes through 5-micrometre capillaries, any particles much larger than 5 micrometres block blood flow. (most of the occlusions are too small to see by angiography). * Most ruptures and clotting events are too small to produce symptoms, though they still produce heart muscle damage, a slow progressive process resulting in ischemic heart disease, the most common basis for congestive heart failure. * The clot organizes and contracts over time, leaving behind narrowing(s) called stenoses. These narrowing(s) are responsible for the symptoms of the disease and are identified, after the fact, by the changes seen on stress tests and angiography, and treated with bypass surgery and/or angioplasty, with or without stents. When this inflammation is combined with other stresses, such as high blood pressure (increased mechanical stretching and contraction of the arteries with each heart beat), it can cause the thin covering over the plaque to split, spilling the contents of the vulnerable plaque into the bloodstream. Recent studies have shown cholesterol crystals within the plaque play a key role in splitting the plaque and also inducing inflammation. The sticky cytokines on the artery wall capture blood cells (mainly platelets) that accumulate at the site of injury. When these cells clump together, they form a thrombus, sometimes large enough to block the artery. The most frequent cause of a cardiac event following rupture of a vulnerable plaque is blood clotting on top of the site of the ruptured plaque that blocks the lumen of the artery, thereby stopping blood flow to the tissues the artery supplies. Upon rupture, atheroma tissue debris may spill into the blood stream; this debris has cholesterol crystals and other material which is often too large (over 5 micrometers) to pass on through the capillaries downstream. In this, the usual situation, the debris obstruct smaller downstream branches of the artery resulting in temporary to permanent end artery/capillary closure with loss of blood supply to, and death of, the previously supplied tissues. A severe case of this can be seen during angioplasty in the slow clearance of injected contrast down the artery lumen. This situation is often termed non-reflow. In addition, atheroma rupture may allow bleeding from the lumen into the inner tissue of the atheroma, making the atheroma size suddenly increase and protrude into the lumen of the artery, producing lumen narrowing or even total obstruction. Detection While a single ruptured plaque can be identified during autopsy as the cause of a coronary event, there is currently no way to identify a culprit lesion before it ruptures.Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics ‚Äì 2006 update, American Heart Association. Because artery walls typically enlarge in response to enlarging plaques, these plaques do not usually produce much stenosis of the artery lumen. Therefore, they are not detected by cardiac stress tests or angiography, the tests most commonly performed clinically with the goal of predicting susceptibility to future heart attack. In contrast to conventional angiography, cardiac CT angiography does enable visualization of the vessel wall as well as plaque composition. Some of the CT derived plaque characteristics can help predict for acute coronary syndrome. In addition, because these lesions do not produce significant stenoses, they are typically not considered \\"critical\\" and/or interventionable by interventional cardiologists, even though research indicates that they are the more important lesions for producing heart attacks. The tests most commonly performed clinically with the goal of testing susceptibility to future heart attack include several medical research efforts, starting in the early to mid-1990s, using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), thermography, near-infrared spectroscopy, careful clinical follow-up, and other methods, to predict these lesions and the individuals most prone to future heart attacks. These efforts remain largely research with no useful clinical methods to date (2006). Furthermore, the usefulness of detecting individual vulnerable plaques by invasive methods has been questioned because many \\"vulnerable\\" plaques rupture without any associated symptoms and it remains unclear if the risk of invasive detection methods is outweighed by clinical benefit. Another approach to detecting and understanding plaque behavior, used in research and by a few clinicians, is to use ultrasound to non-invasively measure wall thickness (usually abbreviated IMT) in portions of larger arteries closest to the skin, such as the carotid or femoral arteries. While stability vs. vulnerability cannot be readily distinguished in this way, quantitative baseline measurements of the thickest portions of the arterial wall (locations with the most plaque accumulation). Documenting the IMT, location of each measurement and plaque size, a basis for tracking and partially verifying the effects of medical treatments on the progression, stability, or potential regression of plaque, within a given individual over time, may be achieved.  Vulnerable plaque vs stable plaque  The factors involved to promote either a vulnerable plaque or a stable plaque are not clear yet, however, the major differences between a vulnerable and stable plaque are that vulnerable plaques have a rich-lipid core and a thin fibrous cap in comparison with the thick fibrous cap and the poor lipid plaque present in the stable plaque. In case of a vulnerable plaque, this results in a larger diameter of the Artery Lumen, which means that patient's life style is not affected, however, when the thin fibrous cap breaks, this causes a prompt activation of platelets which causes the occlusion of the artery, which causes a sudden heart attack if it occurs in the coronary artery. Concerning stable plaques, the thick fibrous cap avoids the breaking risks, however, it reduces significantly the artery diameter which causes the cardiovascular problems related to the decreasing of vessel's diameter ( this is determined by the Hagen‚ÄìPoiseuille equation which explains how flow-rate is related to the radius of the vessel to the fourth power). Prevention Patients can lower their risk for vulnerable plaque rupture in the same ways that they can cut their heart attack risk: Optimize lipoprotein patterns, keep blood glucose levels low normal (see HbA1c), stay slender, eat a proper diet, quit smoking, and maintain a regular exercise program. Researchers also think that obesity and diabetes may be tied to high levels of C-reactive protein.

Although it transitioned to an all-digital format on December 1, 2016, it remains the second largest daily in the state, with nearly one million unique page views a month. Founded on August 22, 1811, as the Greensburg Gazette and in 1889 consolidated with several papers into the Greensburg Tribune-Review, the paper circulated only in the eastern suburban counties of Westmoreland and parts of Indiana and Fayette until May 1992, when it began serving all of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area after a strike at the two Pittsburgh dailies, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and Pittsburgh Press, deprived the city of a newspaper for several months. The Tribune-Review Publishing Company was owned by Richard Mellon Scaife, an heir to the Mellon banking, oil, and aluminum fortune, until his death in July 2014. Scaife was a major funder of conservative organizations, including the Arkansas Project. Accordingly, the Tribune-Review has maintained a conservative editorial stance, contrasting with the more liberal Post-Gazette. In addition to its flagship paper, the company publishes 17 weekly community newspapers, the Pittsburgh Pennysaver, as well as TribLive.com and TribTotalMedia.com.  History  =Origin= The paper began as the Gazette on August 22, 1811. After a series of name changes and mergers it became the Greensburg Daily Tribune in 1889. In 1924, it and the Greensburg Morning Review, launched by David J. Berry in 1903, consolidated their interests under a single ownership. Both papers continued separate publication until 1955, when they merged to form the Greensburg Tribune-Review. Scaife bought the Tribune-Review in 1970. Scaife was a decade early in trying to unarm the Post-Gazette. In 1981‚Äì82, he started a short-lived eastern suburbs paper, The Daily-Sunday Tribune. =Kent State and the Pulitzer= The Tribune-Review owns several \\"satellite\\" papers that insert or surround the regional publication with neighborhood specific stories. The Valley News Dispatch, of Pittsburgh suburbs Tarentum and New Kensington is one such satellite. Local journalism student John Filo worked for the publication while attending nearby Kent State University and served as the Valley News Dispatch's correspondent of the Kent State shootings. His photography that day has ascended to iconic status and won the paper its only Pulitzer Prize. =1990s expansion, and North Hills News Record= Pittsburgh newspaper consolidation timeline During a newspaper strike that temporarily shut down the Post-Gazette and ultimately closed the Pittsburgh Press, Scaife launched the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, an edition of the Greensburg-based Tribune-Review covering Allegheny County and Pittsburgh. Over time, it became a stand-alone newspaper headquartered on Pittsburgh's North Side. In 1997, Scaife added to his small collection of newspapers by purchasing The Daily Courier of Connellsville, the Leader Times of Kittanning and The Valley Independent of Monessen from Thomson Newspapers. In late 1997, Scaife's NewsWorks facility opened in the North Hills. In December 1997, the Tribune- Review company purchased the North Hills News Record, even though four months earlier, then-Trib president Ed Harrell told the Pittsburgh Business Times that the company was not interested in the News Record. Nine months after purchasing the North Hills News Record from Gannett Company, Tribune-Review Publishing Co. announced the paper would be merged with the Pittsburgh Trib. The News Record was most successful during the newspaper strike of the early 1990s. At its demise, the North Hills News Record had a daily circulation of more than 16,000, nearly 1,000 less than its circulation before the Trib bought it. In early 2000, the Trib announced the \\"News Record\\" name would retire after more than two years of a combined \\"Tribune-Review/North Hills News Record\\" banner. North Hills coverage would be wrapped into the Trib's neighborhoods section. =2000s mergers and consolidations= In 2000, the Trib announced it would convert its Irwin-based paper, the daily (except Sunday) Standard Observer, into a twice-weekly regional section of the Greensburg Tribune-Review. Citing a \\"sagging economy\\", the Trib laid off more than four percent of its workforce in 2003, including freelance writers. More shakeups continued in 2005 as circulation numbers dropped and a top official left. An online message board featured back and forth fights between Pittsburgh and Greensburg employees. Edward Harrell, then-president of the Tribune Review Publishing Company, announced in January 2005 that most of the regional editions of the paper would have their newsroom, management and circulation departments merged and staff reductions would follow. The merged papers include the Tribune-Review of Greensburg, the Valley News Dispatch of Tarentum, The Leader-Times of Kittanning, The Daily Courier of Connellsville and the Blairsville Dispatch. The Valley Independent, the only paper with a unionized newsroom and contract, was not affected. The company incorporated as Trib Total Media in the summer of 2005, and purchased Gateway Newspapers, a community publication group servicing approximately 22 communities, at the time, in and around Pittsburgh's Allegheny County. Two managers were immediately laid off. The exact number of proposed redundancies was not announced. In September 2005, Harrell announced his retirement as president of Tribune-Review Publishing Company, effective December 31, 2005. He had served as president since 1989. Several staff writers were laid off in December 2005 as two of Gateway's newspapers were discontinued. In May 2008, the Post- Gazette and the Trib reached a deal for one company to deliver both papers. The Post-Gazette would begin delivering the Trib to most of the area with some exceptions. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. On June 20, 2008, Trib Total Media publicly announced it was closing several weekly newspapers in the Gateway Newspapers chain. The papers affected include: Bridgeville Area News, North Journal, McKnight Journal, Woodland Progress, Penn Hills Progress, Coraopolis-Moon Record and the Advance Leader. Many of those papers were several decades old. The company also announced major changes to the remaining Gateway publications including a revamp of the Pennysaver in the communities that have Gateway newspapers. Several published reports say the remaining community newspapers would expand coverage to include areas no longer serviced by Gateway publications. The communities served by those titles will now be served by other Gateway newspapers. =2015 restructuring= In November, 2015, Trib Total Media announced that they would be cutting back on home delivery of printed newspapers and emphasize digital delivery. The restructuring included the sale of two dailies and six weeklies to West Penn Media. Two papers were closed, The Daily News in McKeesport, and The Valley Independent in Monessen. The remaining papers, in Pittsburgh, Greensburg and Tarentum, became regional editions of a single title, the Tribune-Review. Home delivery was reduced in some parts of Allegheny and Westmoreland counties. Trib Total Media laid off 153 full and part-time workers from its staff of approximately 1,100, another 68 had accepted buyouts in October. The Pittsburgh edition of the Tribune-Review went \\"all-digital\\" after it published its last print edition on November 30, 2016. The Greensburg-based Westmoreland edition and the Tarentum-based Valley News Dispatch edition remained in print.  Investigations, national attention  Carl Prine, an investigative reporter for the newspaper, conducted a probe with the CBS news magazine 60 Minutes that highlighted the lack of security at the nation's most dangerous chemical plants following the September 11, 2001 attacks. The reporters, and a CBS camera operator, were charged with trespassing at a Neville Island plant during their investigation. They were later acquitted when the judge accepted that the story had been in the public interest.http://www.pittsburghlive.com/pages/pdf/gtr030404.pdf#search='Carl%20Prine%20Gallo' In 2007, Prine's further investigation into the subject was featured in the PBS documentary series Expos√©: America's Investigative Reports, in a two-part episode titled \\"Think Like A Terrorist.\\" One Tribune-Review flap went national when Colin McNickle, then editor of the newspaper's editorial page, attended a July 26, 2004 speech at the Massachusetts State House given by Teresa Heinz Kerry, who had been the subject of two negative articles in the Tribune- Review's opinion pages. After the speech, there was a dispute between McNickle and Heinz Kerry over her use of the term \\"un-American activity.\\"  Circulation  The daily Tribune-Review is published in three geographic editions: Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Valley News Dispatch. The Tribune- Review claimed to show the highest gains in readership over the past five years of any newspaper in America's top 48 markets, which were dominated by sinking readership. The growth can be attributed to purchases of other newspapers which were then reclassified as editions of the Tribune Review. According to surveys by International Demographics Inc., an independent media research firm in Houston, the number of Tribune-Review readers jumped 17.8 percent from 2007 to 2012. As part of the Trib Total Media conglomerate, the Tribune-Review has a news exchange partnerships with WPXI, Pittsburgh's NBC affiliate and until 2013, it was a sister publication to Pittsburgh's second- largest news radio station, KQV. Trib Total Media is the Official Newspaper of the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Penguins (the latter of which Scaife was a co-founder in 1967) and has strong partnerships with many nonprofit and community businesses and organizations throughout Western Pennsylvania.

These elite units of Citizens' Militia (MO) were created to fight dangerous criminals, provide security during mass events, and help in the case of natural disasters and other crises; however, they became known instead for their brutal and sometimes lethal actions of riot control and their role in quelling civil rights protests. The first ZOMO units were deployed in 1956 and became particularly infamous for their ruthless handling of political opponents under Polish martial law (1981‚Äì1983). It was permanently disbanded after the fall of communism in 1989, though the term \\"ZOMO\\" remains synonymous with police brutality to this day.  Early history  ZOMO units were created on December 24, 1956 under the direct command of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic and first used in 1957. Their mission statement was defined as \\"the protection of the nation,\\" and their main role was as a rapid-response police force, structured after and trained by the instructors from the Schutzpolizei of East Germany. From 1972, the duties of ZOMO included counter-terrorism (including countering aircraft hijackings), with the elite Special Platoons of the ZOMO (pl. Plutony Specjalne ZOMO) created in 1978. As opposition to the communist government in Poland grew, the units were expanded to counter the growing unrest, and their role became more of anti-riot police. In 1968, ZOMO was used to disperse the student protests during the 1968 Polish political crisis, leading to the reform of the formation. Two years later in 1970, thousands of troops from the Polish People's Army and ZOMO were used to quell the Polish 1970 protests, killing dozens of people and injuring more than 1,000. Martial law  ZOMO in action during the martial law in Poland, 1981 or 1982. The ZOMO gained the most of their infamy during the period of martial law in Poland (1981‚Äì1983). During this time period their brutal actions against peaceful protesters often affiliated with the oppositionist Solidarity movement, and the subsequent lack of prosecution of those responsible for deaths of protesters, were major factors in bringing down the communist regime. To parody the communist newspeak during that time they were often sarcastically called \\"The beating heart of the Party\\" (pl. BijƒÖce serce Partii). Since 1990 several trials against former ZOMO members and their political leaders took place, most prominently in the case of the massacre in the Wujek Coal Mine (where nine people were killed and 21 wounded when Katowice's Special Platoon opened fire on the striking miners in 1981 in the bloodiest incident of the martial law era). Personnel and equipment From the mid-1970s ZOMO was reputed to be one of the best trained and equipped police formations in the Eastern Bloc. A candidate for ZOMO had to have a height of at least 180 cm and a weight of at least 90 kg. After the 1968 expansion, people conscripted to the military could optionally serve their draft in ZOMO (during the martial law, the military reservists who had served in ZOMO were called up to the squads of ORMO, reserve units of MO). The formation numbered nearly 13,000 members in the late 1980s (twice the original designation of 6,600), quartered in barracks in the major cities across the country.https://tvn24.pl/polska/jak- ruszyli-to-nie-bylo-zmiluj-ra193888-3534657 The martial-law-era ZOMO members were equipped with various police and military vehicles (including BTR-60 armoured personnel carriers in the Special Platoons) and various firearms (including shotguns, submachine guns and automatic rifles) as well as various types of riot equipment (such as batons, tear gas grenades, water cannon trucks, rubber bullets, metal and plastic riot shields and visored helmets). From 1968 they wore military-style uniforms with a very similar camouflage pattern to the one used by the Polish People's Army. Legacy \\"ZOMO arrived for an action\\", a political caricature from the 1980s showing ZOMO squads forming the word \\"Gestapo\\" The ZOMO's last action took place on July 3, 1989, when they dispersed a demonstration against the presidential candidature of General Wojciech Jaruzelski, former First Secretary and head of the Military Council of National Salvation (WRON). The units were disbanded on September 7, 1989, following the fall of the communist system, and replaced with the OPP (riot control) and SPAP (rapid response and counter-terrorism) units of Policja (the Polish police). In today's Poland the word \\"ZOMO\\" (or zomowiec, the ZOMO-man) is a pejorative term used by protesters to denote all kinds of riot police (just as the word Gestapo is sometimes shouted out to describe police brutality).

This effect shows that more information is encoded into long-term memory by spaced study sessions, also known as spaced repetition or spaced presentation, than by massed presentation (‚Äúcramming‚Äù). The phenomenon was first identified by Hermann Ebbinghaus, and his detailed study of it was published in the 1885 book (Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology), which suggests that active recall with increasing time intervals reduces the probability of forgetting information. This robust finding has been supported by studies of many explicit memory tasks such as free recall, recognition, cued-recall, and frequency estimation (for reviews see Crowder 1976; Greene, 1989). Researchers have offered several possible explanations of the spacing effect, and much research has been conducted that supports its impact on recall. In spite of these findings, the robustness of this phenomenon and its resistance to experimental manipulation have made empirical testing of its parameters difficult. Causes Decades of research on memory and recall have produced many different theories and findings on the spacing effect. In a study conducted by Cepeda et al. (2006) participants who used spaced practice on memory tasks outperformed those using massed practice in 259 out of 271 cases. As different studies support different aspects of this effect, some now believe that an appropriate account should be multi- factorial, and at present, different mechanisms are invoked to account for the spacing effect in free recall and in explicit cued-memory tasks. Not much attention has been given to the study of the spacing effect in long-term retention tests. Shaughnessy (1977) found that the spacing effect is not robust for twice-presented items after a 24-hour delay in testing. The spacing effect is present, however, for items presented four or six times and tested after a 24-hour delay. The result was interesting because other studies using only twice-presented items have shown a strong spacing effect, although the lag between learning and testing was longer. Shaughnessy interprets it as evidence that no single explanatory mechanism can be used to account for the various manifestations of the spacing effect.Long-Term Retention and the Spacing Effect in Free-Recall and Frequency Judgments John J. Shaughnessy The American Journal of Psychology Vol. 90, No. 4 (Dec., 1977), pp. 587-598 Published by: University of Illinois Press Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1421733 = Semantic priming = Research has shown reliable spacing effects in cued-memory tasks under incidental learning conditions, where semantic analysis is encouraged through orienting tasks (Challis, 1993; Russo & Mammaralla, 2002). Challis found a spacing effect for target words using a frequency estimation task after words were incidentally analyzed semantically. However, no spacing effect was found when the target words were shallowly encoded using a graphemic study task. This suggests that semantic priming underlies the spacing effect in cued-memory tasks. When items are presented in a massed fashion, the first occurrence of the target semantically primes the mental representation of that target, such that when the second occurrence appears directly after the first, there is a reduction in its semantic processing. Semantic priming wears off after a period of time (Kirsner, Smith, Lockhart, & King, 1984), which is why there is less semantic priming of the second occurrence of a spaced item. Thus on the semantic priming account, the second presentation is more strongly primed and receives less semantic processing when the repetitions are massed compared to when presentations are spaced over short lags (Challis, 1993). This semantic priming mechanism provides spaced words with more extensive processing than massed words, producing the spacing effect. From this explanation of the spacing effect, it follows that this effect should not occur with nonsense stimuli that do not have a semantic representation in memory. A number of studies have demonstrated that the semantically based repetition priming approach cannot explain spacing effects in recognition memory for stimuli such as unfamiliar faces, and non-words that are not amenable to semantic analysis (Russo, Parkin, Taylor, & Wilks, 1998; Russo et al., 2002; Mammarella, Russo, & Avons, 2005). Cornoldi and Longoni (1977) have even found a significant spacing effect in a forced-choice recognition memory task when nonsense shapes were used as target stimuli. Russo et al. (1998) proposed that with cued memory of unfamiliar stimuli, a short-term perceptually-based repetition priming mechanism supports the spacing effect. When unfamiliar stimuli are used as targets in a cued-memory task, memory relies on the retrieval of structural-perceptual information about the targets. When the items are presented in a massed fashion, the first occurrence primes its second occurrence, leading to reduced perceptual processing of the second presentation. Short-term repetition-priming effects for nonwords are reduced when the lag between prime and target trials is reduced from zero to six (McKone, 1995), thus it follows that more extensive perceptual processing is given to the second occurrence of spaced items relative to that given to massed items. Hence, nonsense items with massed presentation receive less extensive perceptual processing than spaced items; thus, the retrieval of those items is impaired in cued-memory tasks. Congruent with this view, Russo et al. (2002) demonstrated that changing the font in which repeated presentations of nonwords were presented reduced the short-term perceptual priming of those stimuli, especially for massed items. Upon a recognition memory test, there was no spacing effect found for the nonwords presented in different fonts during study. These results support the hypothesis that short- term perceptual priming is the mechanism that supports the spacing effects in cued-memory tasks when unfamiliar stimuli are used as targets. Furthermore, when the font was changed between repeated presentations of words in the study phase, there was no reduction of the spacing effect. This resistance to the font manipulation is expected with this two-factor account, as semantic processing of words at study determines performance on a later memory test, and the font manipulation is irrelevant to this form of processing. Mammarella, Russo, & Avons (2002) also demonstrated that changing the orientation of faces between repeated presentations served to eliminate the spacing effect. Unfamiliar faces do not have stored representations in memory, thus the spacing effect for these stimuli would be a result of perceptual priming. Changing orientation served to alter the physical appearance of the stimuli, thus reducing the perceptual priming at the second occurrence of the face when presented in a massed fashion. This led to equal memory for faces presented in massed and spaced fashions, hence eliminating the spacing effect. = Encoding variability = The encoding variability theory holds that performance on a memory test is determined by the overlap between the available contextual information during the test and the contextual information available during the encoding. According to this view, spaced repetition typically entails some variability in presentation contexts, resulting in a greater number of retrieval cues. Contrastingly, massed repetitions have limited presentations and therefore fewer retrieval cues. The notion of the efficacy of the increased variability of encoding is supported by the position that the more independent encodings are, the more different types of cues are associated with an item. There are two types of encoding variability theory that address the spacing effect. The first assumes maintains that the spacing effect refers to the changes in the semantic interpretations of items which cause the effect while the second holds that variability surrounding context is responsible for the spacing effect, not only semantic variability. To test the encoding variability theory, Bird, Nicholson, and Ringer (1978)Resistance of the Spacing Effect to Variations in Encoding Charles P. Bird, Angus J. Nicholson and Susan Ringer The American Journal of Psychology Vol. 91, No. 4 (Dec., 1978), pp. 713-721 Published by: University of Illinois Press Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1421519 presented subjects with word lists that either had massed or spaced repetitions. Subjects were asked to perform various \\"orienting tasks\\", tasks which require the subject to make a simple judgment about the list item (i.e. pleasant or unpleasant, active or passive). Subjects either performed the same task for each occurrence of a word or a different task for each occurrence. If the encoding variability theory were true, then the case of different orienting tasks ought to provide variable encoding, even for massed repetitions, resulting in a higher rate of recall for massed repetitions than would be expected. The results showed no such effect, providing strong evidence against the importance of encoding variability. = Study-phase retrieval theory = A theory that has gained a lot of traction recently is the study-phase retrieval theory. This theory assumes that the first presentation is retrieved at the time of the second. This leads to an elaboration of the first memory trace. Massed presentations do not yield advantages because the first trace is active at the time of the second, so it is not retrieved or elaborated upon. Greene (1989) proposed a two-factor account of the spacing effect, combining deficient processing and study-phase retrieval accounts. Spacing effects in free recall are accounted for by the study-phase retrieval account. Under the assumption that free recall is sensitive to contextual associations, spaced items are at an advantage over massed items by the additional encoding of contextual information. Thus, the second occurrence of an item in a list reminds the observer of the previous occurrence of that same item and of its previous contextual features. Different contextual information is encoded with each presentation, whereas for massed items, the difference in context is relatively small. More retrieval cues, then, are encoded with spaced learning, which in turn leads to improved recall. = Deficient processing = According to the deficient processing view, massed repetitions lead to deficient processing of the second presentation‚Äîthat we simply do not pay much attention to the later presentations (Hintzman et al., 1973). Greene (1989) proposed this to be the case in cued-memory tasks (e.g. recognition memory, frequency estimation tasks), which rely more on item information and less on contextual information. The increased voluntary rehearsal of spaced items makes this deficient processing noticeable. Findings that the spacing effect is not found when items are studied through incidental learning support this account. = Retrieval effort hypothesis = According to research conducted by Pyc and Rawson (2009) successful but effortful retrieval tasks during practice enhance memory in an account known as the retrieval effort hypothesis. Spacing out the learning and relearning of items leads to a more effortful retrieval which provides for deeper processing of the item.  Practical applications and long-term retention  =Advertising= The spacing effect and its underlying mechanisms have important applications to the world of advertising. For instance, the spacing effect dictates that it is not an effective advertising strategy to present the same commercial back-to-back (massed repetition). Spaced ads were remembered better than ads that had been repeated back to back. Layout variations presented in short spacing intervals also resulted in improved recall compared to ads presented in exact repetition. The same effect was also achieved in a study involving website advertisements. It was revealed that sales diminish progressively as the customer visited the site and was exposed to the ad several times. However, if the elapsed time between the visits was longer, the advertisement had a bigger effect on sales. If encoding variability is an important mechanism of the spacing effect, then a good advertising strategy might include a distributed presentation of different versions of the same ad. Appleton-Knapp, Bjork and Wickens (2005) examined the effects of spacing on advertising. They found that spaced repetitions of advertisements are more affected by study-phase retrieval processes than encoding variability. They also found that at long intervals, varying the presentation of a given ad is not effective in producing higher recall rates among subjects (as predicted by variable encoding). Despite this finding, recognition is not affected by variations in an ad at long intervals. =Application in education= Studies have shown that long-term spacing effects are prevalent in learning and produce significant learning gains, particularly when the spacing gaps are on the order of days or weeks. Although it is accepted that spacing is beneficial in learning a subject well and previous units should be revisited and practiced, textbooks are written in discrete chapters that do not support these findings. Rohrer conducted a two- part study in 2006 where students were taught how to solve math problems. In part 1, students either used mass or spaced practice, and spaced practice showed significant improvement over mass practice when tested one week later. In the second part of the experiment, practice problems were either grouped by type or mixed randomly. The desirable difficulties encountered by the randomly mixed problems were effective, and the performance by students who solved the randomly mixed problems was vastly superior to the students who solved the problems grouped by type. The reasoning behind this increased performance was that students know the formula for solving equations, but do not always know when to apply the formula. By shuffling problems around and dispersing them across multiple chapters, students also learn to identify when it is appropriate to use which formula. There is conclusive evidence that cumulative final exams promote long-term retention by forcing spaced learning to occur. =Learning and pedagogy= The long-term effects of spacing have also been assessed in the context of learning a foreign language. Bahrick et al. (1993)Maintenance of Foreign Language Vocabulary and the Spacing Effect Harry P. Bahrick, Lorraine E. Bahrick, Audrey S. Bahrick and Phyllis E. Bahrick Psychological Science Vol. 4, No. 5 (Sep., 1993), pp. 316-321 Published by: Sage Publications, Inc. on behalf of the Association for Psychological Science Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40063054 examined the retention of newly learned foreign vocabulary words as a function of relearning sessions and intersession spacing over a 9-year period. Both the amount of relearning sessions and the number of days in between each session have a major impact on retention (the repetition effect and the spacing effect), yet the two variables do not interact with each other. For all three difficulty rankings of the foreign words, recall was highest for the 56-day interval as opposed to a 28-day or a 14-day interval. Additionally, 13 sessions spaced 56 days apart yielded comparable retention to 26 sessions with a 14-day interval. These findings have implications for educational practices. Current school and university curricula rarely provide students with opportunities for periodic retrieval of previously acquired knowledge.\\"The death of the university lecture\\", Huffington Post, retrieved 2016-25-04 Without spaced repetitions, students are more likely to forget foreign language vocabulary. = Lag effect = While the spacing effect refers to improved recall for spaced versus successive (mass) repetition, the term 'lag' can be interpreted as the time interval between repetitions of learning. The lag effect is simply an idea branching off the spacing effect that states recall after long lags between learning is better versus short lags. Michael Kahana's study showed strong evidence that the lag effect is present when recalling word lists. In 2008, Kornell and Bjork published a study that suggested inductive learning is more effective when spaced than massed. Inductive learning is learning through observation of exemplars, so the participants did not actively take notes or solve problems. These results were replicated and backed up by a second independent study.

He is noted for creating the Astronomical Journal, discovering the Gould Belt, and for founding of the Argentine National Observatory and the Argentine National Weather Service. Biography He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, son of Benjamin Apthorp Gould, the principal of Boston Latin School, which the younger Gould attended. His mother was Lucretia Dana Goddard. The poet Hannah Flagg Gould was his aunt. After going on to Harvard College and graduating in 1844, he studied mathematics and astronomy under C. F. Gauss at G√∂ttingen, Germany, during which time he published approximately 20 papers on the observation and motion of comets and asteroids. Following completion of his Ph.D. (he was the first American to receive this degree in astronomy) he toured European observatories asking for advice on what could be done to further astronomy as a professional science in the U.S.A. The main advice he received was to start a professional journal modeled after what was then the world's leading astronomical publication, the Astronomische Nachrichten. Gould returned to America in 1848 and from 1852 to 1867 was in charge of the longitude department of the United States Coast Survey. He developed and organized the service, was one of the first to determine longitudes by telegraphic means, and employed the Atlantic cable in 1866 to establish accurate longitude-relations between Europe and America. After his return to Cambridge, Massachusetts, Gould started the Astronomical Journal in 1849, which he published until 1861. He resumed publication in 1885 and it is still published today. From 1855 to 1859 he acted as director of the Dudley Observatory at Albany, New York, and in 1859 published a discussion of the places and proper motions of circumpolar stars to be used as standards by the United States Coast Survey. In 1861 he undertook the enormous task of preparing for publication the records of astronomical observations made at the U.S. Naval Observatory since 1850. In 1851 Gould suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the generic symbol of an asteroid. In 1864 he was admitted to the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati to represent his grandfather Captain Benjamin Gould. In the 1890s he became an early member of the Massachusetts Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. Appointed in 1862 actuary to the United States Sanitary Commission, he issued in 1869 an important volume of Military and Anthropological Statistics. In 1864 he fitted up a private observatory at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and undertook in 1868, on behalf of the Argentine republic, to organize a national observatory at C√≥rdoba. In 1871 he became the first director of the Argentine National Observatory (today, Observatorio Astron√≥mico de C√≥rdoba of the National University of C√≥rdoba). While there, he and four assistants extensively mapped the southern hemisphere skies using newly developed photometric methods. On June 1, 1884, he made the last definite sighting of the Great Comet of 1882. The need of astronomers for good weather prediction spurred Gould to collaborate with Argentine colleagues to develop the Argentine National Weather Service, the first in South America. Gould's measurements of L. M. Rutherfurd's photographs of the Pleiades in 1866 entitle him to rank as a pioneer in the use of the camera as an instrument of precision; and he secured at C√≥rdoba 1400 negatives of southern star clusters, the reduction of which occupied the closing years of his life. He remained in Argentina until 1885, when he returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts. He received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1883 and the James Craig Watson Medal in 1887. Astronomers continue to investigate the astrophysics of a large scale feature of the Milky Way to which he called their attention in 1877, and honor him with its name, The Gould Belt. A crater on the Moon is named after him. Gould was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1892.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory He died at Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1896. Alice Bache Gould (1868‚Äì1953), a mathematician, philanthropist, and historian, was one of his five children. = Uranography = In 1874 Gould completed his greatest work, the Uranometria Argentina (published 1879), for which he received in 1883 the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. The publication assigned Gould designations to all bright stars within 100 degrees of the south celestial pole in a manner similar to what Flamsteed had earlier done for the northern hemisphere. An updated version, to which late 20th century data have been appended to the complete information for all stars in the original Uranometria Argentina, is available at www.uranometriaargentina.com/. Gould followed his Uranometria Argentina with a zone-catalogue of 73,160 stars (1884), and a general catalogue (1885) compiled from meridian observations of 32,448 stars.

It is a type of pharyngitis. Symptoms may include sore throat, fever, enlargement of the tonsils, trouble swallowing, and large lymph nodes around the neck. Complications include peritonsillar abscess. Tonsillitis is most commonly caused by a viral infection, with about 5% to 40% of cases caused by a bacterial infection. When caused by the bacterium group A streptococcus, it is referred to as strep throat. Rarely bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, or Haemophilus influenzae may be the cause. Typically the infection is spread between people through the air. A scoring system, such as the Centor score, may help separate possible causes. Confirmation may be by a throat swab or rapid strep test. Treatment efforts involve improving symptoms and decreasing complications. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen may be used to help with pain. If strep throat is present the antibiotic penicillin by mouth is generally recommended. In those who are allergic to penicillin, cephalosporins or macrolides may be used. In children with frequent episodes of tonsillitis, tonsillectomy modestly decreases the risk of future episodes. About 7.5% of people have a sore throat in any three-month period and 2% of people visit a doctor for tonsillitis each year. It is most common in school aged children and typically occurs in the fall and winter months. The majority of people recover with or without medication. In 40% of people, symptoms resolve within three days, and in 80% symptoms resolve within one week, regardless of whether streptococcus is present or not. Antibiotics decrease symptom duration by approximately 16 hours. Signs and symptoms Illustration comparing normal tonsil anatomy and tonsillitis Common signs and symptoms include: *sore throat *red, swollen tonsils *pain when swallowing *high temperature (fever) *headache *tiredness *chills *a general sense of feeling unwell (malaise) *white pus-filled spots on the tonsils *swollen lymph nodes (glands) in the neck *pain in the ears or neck *weight loss *difficulty ingesting and swallowing meal/liquid intake *difficulty sleeping Less common symptoms include: *nausea *fatigue *stomach ache *vomiting *furry tongue *bad breath (halitosis) *voice changes *difficulty opening the mouth (trismus) *loss of appetite *anxiety/fear of choking In cases of acute tonsillitis, the surface of the tonsil may be bright red and with visible white areas or streaks of pus.Tonsillitis and Adenoid Infection MedicineNet. Retrieved on 2010-01-25 Tonsilloliths occur in up to 10% of the population frequently due to episodes of tonsillitis. Causes Bacteria or viruses can cause tonsillitis. The most common cause is viral infection. It accounts for 50 to 80% of tonsillitis cases. It most often includes adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. It is occasionally caused by Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, or HIV. About 1 to 10% of the cases are caused by Epstein-Barr virus. The second most common cause is bacterial infection of which the predominant is Group A Œ≤-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), which causes strep throat. Bacterial infection of the tonsils usually follows the initial viral infection. Less common bacterial causes include: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA ), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Fusobacterium sp., Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Treponema pallidum, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Anaerobic bacteria have been implicated in tonsillitis and a possible role in the acute inflammatory process is supported by several clinical and scientific observations. Under normal circumstances, as viruses and bacteria enter the body through the nose and mouth, they are filtered in the tonsils. Within the tonsils, white blood cells of the immune system destroy the viruses or bacteria by producing inflammatory cytokines like phospholipase A2, which also lead to fever. The infection may also be present in the throat and surrounding areas, causing inflammation of the pharynx. Sometimes, tonsillitis is caused by an infection of spirochaeta and treponema, in this case called Vincent's angina or Plaut-Vincent angina. ‚Äî fusospirillum complex (Plaut-Vincent angina) Van Cauwenberge studied the tonsils of 126 patients using direct microscope observation. The results showed that 40% of acute tonsillitis was caused by Vincent's angina and 27% of chronic tonsillitis was caused by Spirochaeta Diagnosis Throat swab. In primary care settings (health clinics), Centor criteria is used to determine the likelihood of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infection in an acute tonsilitis and the need of antibiotics for tonsilitis treatment. However, Centor criteria has its weaknesses in making precise diagnosis for adults. Besides, it is also ineffective in diagnosis for tonsilitis in children and in secondary care settings (hospitals). There are four major criteria in Centor score: presence of tonsillar exudate, painful neck lymph nodes, history of fever, age between 5 and 15 years, and the absence of cough. The possibility of GABHS infection increases with increasing score. The probability for getting GABHS is 2 to 23% for the score of 1, and 25 to 85% for the score of 4. The diagnosis of GABHS tonsillitis can be confirmed by culture of samples obtained by swabbing the throat and plating them on sheep blood agar medium. The isolation rate can be increased by incubating the cultures under anaerobic conditions and using selective growth media. A single throat culture has a sensitivity of 90‚Äì95% for the detection of GABHS (which means that GABHS is actually present 5‚Äì10% of the time when the culture result suggests that it is absent). This small percentage of false-negative results are part of the characteristics of the tests used but are also possible if the patient has received antibiotics prior to testing. Identification requires 24 to 48 hours by culture but rapid screening tests (10‚Äì60 minutes), which have a sensitivity of 85‚Äì90%, are available. True infection with GABHS, rather than colonization, is defined arbitrarily as the presence of >10 colonies of GABHS per blood agar plate. However, this method is difficult to implement because of the overlap between carriers and infected patients. In 40% of the people without any symptoms, the throat culture can be positive. Therefore, throat culture is not routinely used in clinical practice for the detection of GABHs. Older antigen tests detect the surface Lancefield group A carbohydrate. Newer tests identify GABHS serotypes using nucleic acid (DNA) probes or polymerase chain reaction. Bacterial culture may need to be performed in cases of a negative rapid streptococcal test. An increase in antistreptolysin O (ASO) streptococcal antibody titer 3‚Äì6 weeks following the acute infection can provide retrospective evidence of GABHS infection and is considered definitive proof of GABHS infection. Epstein Barr virus serology can be tested for those who may have infectious mononucleosis with a typical lymphocyte count in full blood count result. Blood investigations are only required for those with hospital admission and required intravenous antibiotics. Increased values of secreted phospholipase A2 and altered fatty acid metabolism in patients with tonsillitis may have diagnostic utility. Nasoendoscopy can be used for those with severe neck pain and inability to swallow any fluids to rule out masked epiglottis and supraglotitis. Routine nasoendscopy is not recommended for children. Treatment Treatments to reduce the discomfort from tonsillitis include: *pain and fever reducing medications such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen *warm salt water gargle, lozenges, honey, or warm liquids When tonsillitis is caused by a virus, the length of illness depends on which virus is involved. Usually, a complete recovery is made within one week; however, symptoms may last for up to two weeks. =Antibiotics= If the tonsillitis is caused by group A streptococcus, then antibiotics are useful, with penicillin or amoxicillin being primary choices. Cephalosporins and macrolides are considered good alternatives to penicillin in the acute setting. A macrolide such as azithromycin or erythromycin is used for people allergic to penicillin. Individuals who fail penicillin therapy may respond to treatment effective against beta-lactamase producing bacteria such as clindamycin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. Aerobic and anaerobic beta lactamase producing bacteria that reside in the tonsillar tissues can \\"shield\\" group A streptococcus from penicillins. There is no significant differences in efficacy of various groups of antibiotics in the tonsilitis treatment. Intravenous antibiotics can be for those who are hospitalised with inability to swallow and presented with complications. Oral antibiotics can be resumed immediately if the person is clinically improved and able to swallow orally. Duration of antibiotics use is of 7 days. =Pain medication= Paracetamol is recommended for the pain treatment. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and opioids such as codeine and tramadol are equally effective, precautions have to be taken because NSAIDs can cause peptic ulcer disease and are bad for kidneys. Opioids can cause respiratory depression for those who are vulnerable. Similarly, in children, paracetamol and NSAIDs can be used except for codeine need to be used with precautions. Anaesthetic mouthwash can also be used for symptomatic relief. =Corticosteroids= Corticosteroids are helpful in the reduction of pain and improvement of symptoms in 24 to 48 hours. Oral corticosteroids are recommended unless the person is unable to swallow medications. =Surgery= Chronic cases can be treated with tonsillectomy (the surgical removal of tonsils) as a choice for treatment. Children have had only a modest benefit from tonsillectomy for chronic cases of tonsillitis. Prognosis Since the advent of penicillin in the 1940s, a major preoccupation in the treatment of streptococcal tonsillitis has been the prevention of rheumatic fever, and its major effects on the nervous system (Sydenham's chorea) and heart. Recent evidence would suggest that the rheumatogenic strains of group A beta hemolytic strep have become markedly less prevalent and are now only present in small pockets such as in Salt Lake City, USA. This brings into question the rationale for treating tonsillitis as a means of preventing rheumatic fever. Complications may rarely include dehydration and kidney failure due to difficulty swallowing, blocked airways due to inflammation, and pharyngitis due to the spread of infection. An abscess may develop lateral to the tonsil during an infection, typically several days after the onset of tonsillitis. This is termed a peritonsillar abscess (or quinsy). Rarely, the infection may spread beyond the tonsil resulting in inflammation and infection of the internal jugular vein giving rise to a spreading septicaemia infection (Lemierre's syndrome). In chronic/recurrent cases (generally defined as seven episodes of tonsillitis in the preceding year, five episodes in each of the preceding two years or three episodes in each of the preceding three years), ‚Äî notes though that these criteria \\"have been arrived at arbitrarily\\" from: ‚Äî this later study by the same team looked at less severely affected children and concluded \\"modest benefit conferred by tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy in children moderately affected with recurrent throat infection seems not to justify the inherent risks, morbidity, and cost of the operations\\" ‚Äî review of literature of the past 25 years concludes \\"No consensus has yet been reached, however, about the number of annual episodes that justify tonsillectomy\\" or in acute cases where the palatine tonsils become so swollen that swallowing is impaired, a tonsillectomy can be performed to remove the tonsils. Patients whose tonsils have been removed are still protected from infection by the rest of their immune system. In strep throat, very rarely diseases like glomerulonephritis can occur. These complications are extremely rare in developed nations but remain a significant problem in poorer nations. ‚Äî Canadian Medical Association Journal commentary on Cochrane analysis ‚Äî Medical Journal of Australia commentary on Cochrane analysis Tonsillitis associated with strep throat, if untreated, is hypothesized to lead to pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS).

She continued to work as well in Laurel and Hardy shorts with Hal Roach in cooperation with Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, such as in the 1930 release Blotto in which she plays Stan's feisty wife. A decade later she performed in the 1940 Three Stooges short Cookoo Cavaliers, briefly appearing as a customer requesting a haddock.Solomon, Jon (2002).

Left: the lock body, installed in the thickness of a door. This one has two bolts: a sprung latch at the top, and a locking bolt at the bottom. Right: the box keep, installed in the doorjamb. A mortise lock (also spelled mortice lock in British English) is a lock that requires a pocket‚Äîthe mortise‚Äîto be cut into the edge of the door or piece of furniture into which the lock is to be fitted. In most parts of the world, mortise locks are found on older buildings constructed before the advent of bored cylindrical locks, but they have recently become more common in commercial and upmarket residential construction in the United States. They are widely used in domestic properties of all ages in Europe. History in the United States Mortise locks have been used as part of door hardware systems in America since the second quarter of the eighteenth century. In these early forms, the mortise lock mechanism was combined with a pull to open the unlocked door. Eventually, pulls were replaced by knobs. Until the mid- nineteenth century, mortise locks were only used in the most formal rooms in the most expensive houses. Other rooms used box locks, or rim locks, in which, unlike in mortise locks, the latch itself is in a self-contained unit that is applied to the outside of the door. Rim locks have been used in the United States since the early eighteenth century.Schiffer, Herbert. Early Pennsylvania Hardware. Box E. Exton: Schiffer Publishing, Inc., 1966. A rim lock has the lock body and bolt mechanism on the outside of the door, unlike a mortise lock, where the bolt is inside the door. An early example of the use of mortise locks in conjunction with rim locks in one house comes from Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. In 1805, Jefferson wrote to his joiner listing the locks he required for his home. While closets received rim locks, Jefferson ordered twenty-six mortise locks for use in the principal rooms. Depictions of available mortise lock hardware, including not only lock mechanisms themselves but also escutcheon plates and door pulls, were widely available in the early nineteenth century in trade catalogues. However, the locks were still expensive and difficult to obtain at this time. Jefferson ordered his locks from Paris. Similarly, mortise locks were used in primary rooms in 1819 at Decatur House in Washington, D.C. while rim locks were used in closets and other secondary spaces. Warded lock mechanism, only rarely used for mortise locks, owing to the depth required The mortise locks used at Monticello were warded locks. The name warded locks refers to the lock mechanism, while the name mortise lock refers to the bolt location. Warded locks contain a series of static obstructions, or wards, within the lock box; only a key with cutouts to match the obstructions will be able to turn freely in the lock and open the latch.Bill, Phillips. The Complete Book of Locks and Locksmithing. pp. 60, 62. Warded locks were used in Europe throughout the medieval period and up until early 19th century. Three British locksmiths, Robert Barron, Joseph Bramah, and Jeremiah Chubb, all played a role in creating modern lever tumbler locks. Chubb's lock was patented in 1818. Again, the name refers to the lock mechanism, so a lock can be both a mortise lock and a lever tumbler lock. In the modern lever tumbler lock, the key moves a series of levers that allow the bolt to move in the door.\\"The Evolution of Everyday Objects: the History of the Key. Slate Magazine. Pin tumbler lock, commonly used for mortise locks in the US The next major innovation to mortise lock mechanisms came in 1865. Linus Yale, Jr.'s pin tumbler mortise cylinder lock put not only the latch or bolt itself inside the door, but also the tumblers and the bolt mechanism. Up to this point, the lock mechanism was always on the outside of the door regardless of the bolt location. This innovation allowed keys to be shorter as they no longer had to reach all the way through a door. Pin tumbler locks are still the most common kind of mortise lock used today.  Mechanism  Mortise locks may include a non-locking sprung latch operated by a door handle. Such a lock is termed a sash lock. A simpler form without a handle or latch is termed a 'dead lock'. Dead locks are commonly used as a secure backup to a sprung non-deadlocking latch, usually a pin tumbler rim lock.The type commonly called a 'Yale' lock. Mortise locks have historically, and still commonly do, use lever locks as a mechanism. Older mortise locks may have used warded lock mechanisms. This has led to a popular confusion, as the term 'mortise lock' is usually used in reference to lever keys. In recent years the Euro cylinder lock has become common, using a pin tumbler lock in a mortise housing. The parts included in the typical US mortise lock installation are the lock body (the part installed inside the mortise cut-out in the door); the lock trim (which may be selected from any number of designs of doorknobs, levers, handle sets and pulls); a strike plate, or a box keep, which lines the hole in the frame into which the bolt fits; and the keyed cylinder which operates the locking/unlocking function of the lock body. However, in the United Kingdom, and most other countries, mortise locks on dwellings do not use cylinders, but have lever mechanisms.  Installation  The installation of a mortise lock can be undertaken by the average homeowner with a working knowledge of basic woodworking tools and methods. Many installation specialists use a mortising jig which makes precise cutting of the pocket a simple operation, but the subsequent installation of the external trim can still prove problematic if the installer is inexperienced. Although the installation of a mortise lock actually weakens the structure of the typical timber door, it is stronger and more versatile than a bored cylindrical lock, both in external trim, and functionality. Whereas the latter mechanism lacks the architecture required for ornate and solid-cast knobs and levers, the mortise lock can accommodate a heavier return spring and a more solid internal mechanism, making its use possible. Furthermore, a mortise lock typically accepts a wide range of other manufacturers' cylinders and accessories, allowing architectural conformity with lock hardware already on site. Some of the most common manufacturers of mortise locks in the United States are Nostalgic Warehouse, Accurate, Arrow, Baldwin, Best, Corbin Russwin, Emtek Products, Inc, Falcon, Penn, Schlage, Sargent and Yale. Also, many European manufacturers whose products had been restricted to \\"designer\\" installations have recently gained wider acceptance and use.  Notes   References  *Peter Brett.

It is the administrative seat of Burhanpur District. It is situated on the north bank of the Tapti River and southwest of the state's capital city of Bhopal. The city is a Municipal Corporation. Connectivity Burhanpur is a historical city that is well connected to other cities of India via railway network. The city has one railway station, while regular buses are available for travel to nearby cities. The closest airport is Jalgaon Airport, which is present on north side of the city. Within the city, private cars and cabs are available for hire. Road connectivity is good and due to it, goods are transported to other cities seamlessly.  History  The Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan hunting wild Asiatic lions in Burhanpur (July 1630) = Pre-Mughal period = Burhanpur was an important city under the Rashtrakuta Dynasty from 753‚Äì982. Excavations of the Tapti River and Asirgarh Fort have discovered many coins, goddess idols and temples from the prehistoric era. However, Burhanpur came to prominence during the medieval period. In 1388, Malik Nasir Khan, the Faruqi dynasty Sultan of Khandesh, discovered Burhanpur, at the behest of Shaikh Zainuddin and renamed it after a well-known medieval Sufi saint, Burhan-ud- Din. Burhanpur became the capital of the Khandesh sultanate. Later, Miran Adil Khan II (reigned 1457‚Äì1501), another sultan of this dynasty, built a citadel and a number of palaces in Burhanpur. During his long reign, Burhanpur was transformed into a major centre for trade and textile production. = Under the Mughals = In 1601, the Mughal emperor Akbar annexed the Khandesh sultanate and Burhanpur became the capital of Khandesh subah, one of three new top-level provinces in the Mughal empire, added in 1601 (like Berar subah in 1869 and Ahmadnagar subah in 1601‚Äì35) to the initial dozen as he conquered much of the Deccan. Khandesh was renamed Danesh after Akbar's son Daniyal. In 1609, Mughal emperor Jahangir appointed his second son Parviz to the governorship of the Mughal provinces of the Deccan, and the prince chose Burhanpur as his headquarters and his residence. Royal bath or hammam Shahi qila Burhanpur Burhanpur became a beautiful city, and many historical monuments survive in its expanse, mainly dating from the rule of the great Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Burhanpur was an important Mughal outpost. Shah Jahan spent a considerable amount of time in this city, and helped add to the Shahi Qila. The Shahi Qila is one majestic palace in Burhanpur, located to the west of the Tapti River. Diwan-i-Aam and Diwan-i-Khas were built on the terrace of the Qila. Little of it remains today, as the Qila is mostly in ruins. However, the parts of the palace that are still standing display exquisite sculpture and carvings. The main attraction at the palace is the hamam or royal bath. It was specifically built for Shah Jahan's wife, Mumtaz Mahal so that she could enjoy a luxurious bath. It is said that she died there while giving birth to her fourteenth child. Even today, the ceiling has many intricate paintings. One of these paintings depicts a monument which is said to have been the inspiration for the Taj Mahal, her final resting place. She was initially buried there for six months before being moved. The original grave called the Aahukhana is in disrepair. = Maratha conquest = In 1705, Santaji Ghorpade attacked Burhanpur and Khandesh subha to force the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to deploy more forces in Khandesh. This in turn relieved some of the pressure on Karnataka and Maratha swarajya from Mughal armies. In 1720s, the city was taken by the Maratha Peshwa Bajirao during his expedition to Malwa and Delhi. In 1750s, a Maratha army under Sadashivrao Bhau, who defeated the Nizam of Hyderabad, took control of the town. At the downfall of the Maratha Empire, the city was given to Maratha Sardar Holkar, Scindia, and then finally in 1818 was handed over to British by the Marathas.  Geography  Burhanpur is situated on the southwestern border of Madhya Pradesh, near the banks of the Tap(t)i River. Demographics As 2011 Indian Census, population of Burhanpur in 2011 was 210,886, of which males and females were 108,187 and 102,699 respectively. The population in the age group of 0 to 6 years was 28,930, of which 15,035 were males and 13,895 were females. The total number of literates in Burhanpur was 147,056, which constituted 69.7% of the population with male literacy of 73.3% and female literacy of 65.9%. The effective literacy rate of 7+ population of Burhanpur was 80.8%, of which male literacy rate was 85.1% and female literacy rate was 76.3%. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population was 14,440 and 2,179 respectively. Burhanpur had 38118 households in 2011.  Tourism  thumbBurhanpur was ruled by several dynasties, and consequently has many visitor attractions of historical interest. It has three rivers, the Tapti, the Utavali and the Mohna, with several natural sights for visitors to Burhanpur. This small town has four small ghats. Being the home of a very diverse population, Burhanpur has a notable Gurudwara, Masjid, Church, a world-famous Dargah * Asirgarh Fort ‚Äì The fort built by Asa Ahir of the Ahir dynasty is notable for its historical architecture. This fort during its prime time was difficult to win because of being built at a great height, with strong outer walls which are still standing intact. It is situated on Burhanpur-Khandwa Highway, from Burhanpur. * Shahi Qila ‚Äì A rare fort with a complete garden on its terrace. It was built in the Farooqi Dynasty and ruled by Shahjahan for a long period of time. His beloved wife Mumtaz died here and it is believed that the Taj Mahal was decided to be made in Burhanpur before the plan was cancelled due to lack of white marble here at the time, though Mumtaz was buried here for six months after her death until Taj Mahal construction was completed. * Jama Masjid ‚Äì The Jama Masjid is a historic monument as well as a place of worship. It is centrally located in Gandhi Chowk. The construction of Jama Masjid started in Farooqi rule.

All national banks and savings institutions are chartered and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. State banks are chartered and regulated by a state agency (often called the Department of Financial Institutions) in the state in which its headquarters are located. In addition, state banks that are members of the Federal Reserve are regulated by the Federal Reserve; state banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve are regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Therefore, virtually every state chartered bank has both a state and federal regulator. There are a very small number of state banks that do not have FDIC insurance.

Described as \\"an accomplished sorcerer and a devoted servant of the Outer Dark,\\" he has supernatural abilities involving necromancy, prophecy, and influence over animal and human behavior. His goals typically center on bringing down civilizations through destruction and conflict.. He has a variety of names, usually with the initial letters \\"R. F.\\" but with occasional exceptions, such as Walter o'Dim (originally envisioned by King as a separate character) in The Dark Tower series and Marten Broadcloak. Flagg first appeared in King's 1978 novel The Stand as a demonic figure who wreaks havoc after a plague kills most of the population. He makes his second appearance in the 1984 novel The Eyes of the Dragon as an evil wizard trying to plunge the fictional medieval city of Delain into chaos. Flagg was a primary antagonist in King's epic series, The Dark Tower, who tries to keep protagonist Roland Deschain from reaching the Tower‚Äîthe linchpin of existence‚Äîso he can claim it for himself and become a god. The Dark Tower expanded on Flagg's background and motivation, linking his previous appearances. Aside from King's novels, Flagg was featured in a 1994 television miniseries adaptation of The Stand, in which he was portrayed by Jamey Sheridan, and The Dark Tower film adaptation, in which he was portrayed by Matthew McConaughey. He has also appeared in Marvel Comics' adaptations of The Dark Tower and The Stand. King initially cited Donald DeFreeze, primary kidnapper of Patty Hearst, as his inspiration for Flagg. Later, he attributed Flagg to an image of a man walking the roads in cowboy boots, denim jeans, a jacket, and most importantly wearing a hat (according to Stephen King himself), a notion which \\"came out of nowhere\\" when he was in college. Flagg's character and the nature of his evil have been the subject of considerable critical attention. Appearances =Poem=  \\"The Dark Man\\"  King first wrote the poem \\"The Dark Man\\" in college, about an unnamed man who rides the rails and confesses to murder and rape. The one-page poem was published in Ubris in 1969. =Novels= The Stand Randall Flagg makes his first named appearance in King's 1978 apocalyptic novel, The Stand, where he tries to construct a new civilization in the United States after a plague kills most of the population. Flagg is described as a \\"tall man of no age\\" in old blue jeans, denim jacket and old cowboy boots. He wears an old Boy Scout knapsack, and his jacket pockets are stuffed with pamphlets from dozens of fringe splinter groups. Flagg's background is vague, even to him; he says that at some point he just \\"became\\", although he remembers being a Marine, a Klansman, a Viet Cong member, and having a hand in the kidnapping of Patty Hearst. In Las Vegas Flagg attracts people drawn to destruction, power and tyranny, using crucifixion, torture and other punishments on those disloyal to him. His followers reorganize society, repairing and restarting services in the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. Flagg plans to attack and destroy a rival emerging civilization‚ÄîMother Abagail's Free Zone in Boulder, Colorado‚Äîto become the dominant society in the former United States. After two of Flagg's followers fail to kill the leaders of the Free Zone, the Boulder community sends a group of men to Las Vegas to stop him. The three who reach the city are taken prisoner, and Flagg orders one of them executed for his defiance. As the other two are being prepared for a public execution, one of Flagg's most loyal followers, the Trashcan Man, arrives with a nuclear warhead salvaged from a military base. As Trash dies of radiation poisoning the Hand of God appears, detonating the warhead and annihilating Flagg, his followers, and the prisoners. An expanded edition of The Stand was published in 1990, restoring text that had been cut from the original edition. It includes an epilogue in which Flagg appears on a beach and finds a primitive tribe ready to fall under his influence. The Eyes of the Dragon Flagg later appears in The Eyes of the Dragon (1986) as an evil wizard wreaking havoc in the medieval country of Delain. He is described as a \\"thin and stern faced man of about 50 [years of age]\\", despite being much older. He hides himself under a dark cloak, and most of his magic comes from spells, potions, and poisons. He is described as a \\"sickness\\" which seems to reappear in Delain when there is something worth destroying. In this novel, Flagg schemes to throw the kingdom of Delain into chaos by poisoning the king and framing Prince Peter, the legitimate heir to the throne, for the crime. Peter's naive, resentful younger brother Thomas becomes king instead; Flagg, whom he sees as his only friend, becomes his royal advisor. Due to his youth and inexperience, Thomas allows Flagg great power and is easily manipulated by the wizard. Flagg becomes the de facto ruler of Delain, plunging the kingdom into a dark age. Years later Thomas confronts Flagg about his father's murder, which he witnessed as a child but suppressed the memory out of fear. Thomas shoots Flagg in the eye with an arrow, and Flagg disappears from the kingdom. Peter is given his rightful throne; Thomas and his butler, Dennis, leave the kingdom in search of Flagg. The novel states that Thomas and Dennis find Flagg, but the nature of their encounter is never revealed and Flagg survives to engender chaos in later stories. The Dark Tower series Walter o'Dim, Flagg's main persona in The Dark Tower. O'Dim was originally written as a separate character from Flagg, but King later combined the two. Art by Michael Whelan Flagg makes several appearances in King's Dark Tower series (1978‚Äì2012), which follows gunslinger Roland Deschain as he travels in search of the Dark Tower. Flagg's presence is felt in the opening sentence of the first book: \\"The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed\\". In this series, Flagg assumes the guise of several individuals. He first appears as Walter o'Dim, chased across the desert by Roland. In flashbacks Flagg assumes the identity of Marten Broadcloak, a wizard who conspires with the Crimson King to cause the fall of the Dark Tower. In the original edition of the first novel Marten is a separate person from Walter, who is also not known to be Flagg, but Marten and Walter are retconned into one character in the revised version. When Roland was young, Marten had an affair with Roland's mother, Gabrielle, using the affair to provoke Roland to take the gunslinger test early. He hoped Roland would fail so he would be exiled but Roland passed the test. Eventually, Roland catches Walter; they have a long discussion about Roland's destiny and the Tower which causes him to slip into delirium. He awakens to find a pile of bones in Walter's place. In the original edition Walter and Marten are separate characters, with Walter dying at the end of the novel. When King published an expanded edition of the novel Walter and Marten are portrayed as identical, and Walter fakes his own death. Flagg appears briefly in a flashback in the second installment of the Dark Tower series, The Drawing of the Three. Roland recalls seeing two men named Thomas and Dennis pursuing a man named Flagg, who was almost certainly a demon. These are implied to be the same characters from The Eyes of the Dragon. This is the first example of the Dark Tower series crossing over with one of King's other novels. Flagg makes his next full appearance in the series' third installment, The Waste Lands. In the city of Lud, Flagg saves Tick-Tock Man Andrew Quick, an enemy of Roland's ka-tet left for dead in an earlier confrontation. Quick becomes Flagg's devoted servant, and Flagg assumes the name of Richard Fannin. The character returns in the fourth book, Wizard and Glass, as Marten Broadcloak. Also identifying himself as Flagg, he warns Roland and his ka-tet to abandon their quest for the Dark Tower. In flashbacks the reader learns that Flagg as Walter o'Dim was an emissary for John Farson, one of those responsible for the destruction of Roland's home Gilead. The \\"Argument\\", a summary of the series thus far, beginning Wolves of the Calla‚Äîthe fifth novel in the series‚Äînotes that Flagg is known as Broadcloak, Fannin and John Farson, depending on the world in which he lives. In Wolves of the Calla, Flagg makes a brief appearance as Walter o'Dim when Father Callahan arrives in Roland's world. Flagg gives Callahan Black Thirteen, a dangerous crystal ball, hoping it will kill Roland on his way to the tower. In this encounter, Flagg is described with \\"the face of a human weasel\\", and \\"the same welling red circle\\" on his forehead as the Can-toi. His appearance in Song of Susannah is via a flashback revealing that Flagg bargained with the succubus Mia; this resulted in the birth of Mordred Deschain, son of both Roland and the Crimson King. In The Dark Tower, Flagg indicates that he is not John Farson, but served under him until the latter's downfall. Flagg reveals his plans to climb the Dark Tower, see the room at the top and become the god of all. Flagg believes that he can only achieve this by killing Mordred and taking his birthmark-stained foot. Although he tries to befriend Mordred and pledge allegiance to him, Mordred telepathically senses Flagg's true motives and eats him, forcing him to rip out his eyes and tongue first. The Dark Tower reveals more of Flagg's background, relating that he was born Walter Padick in Delain to Sam the Miller of Eastar'd Barony. At age 13 Walter set out for a life on the road, but was raped by a fellow wanderer; author Bev Vincent hypothesized in The Road to the Dark Tower that Flagg's later actions towards Delain in The Eyes of the Dragon may have been revenge for the abuse he suffered as a child. Resisting the temptation to crawl back home, Padick instead moves towards his destiny; he learns various forms of magic, achieving a quasi-immortality. After centuries of wreaking havoc Flagg attracts the attention of the Crimson King, who adopts him as his emissary. In 2013, King published a new story from The Dark Tower entitled The Wind Through the Keyhole. Here Flagg is depicted as the Covenant Man: central villain of the book's story within a story, \\"The Wind Through the Keyhole\\", a legend from Mid-World set years before the series' beginning. He is the Barony's \\"tax collector\\" from Gilead, attempting to collect taxes from residents of the small town of Tree. The Covenant Man sends the story's protagonist, a young boy named Tim, on a perilous quest through the Endless Forest to save his mother; unbeknownst to Tim, the Covenant Man is supplying him with false prophecies and misinformation as part of a cruel practical joke. However, Tim succeeds in his journey; he saves his mother after encountering the wizard Maerlyn, who has been imprisoned in the form of a \\"tyger\\". While the Covenant Man is not explicitly identified as Flagg, with only the initials \\"RF/MB\\" in his signature as identification and at one point being referred to as 'the man in the black cloak', Stephen King confirmed in an interview with Bev Vincent for his book The Dark Tower Companion that the two are one and the same. Hearts in Atlantis In Hearts in Atlantis (1999), Raymond Fiegler is identified near the novel's end as leader of an activist group when he prevents Carol Gerber from retrieving an unexploded bomb on a college campus. King never identifies Fiegler as Flagg, but Christopher Golden and Hank Wagner suggest in The Complete Stephen King Universe that there is little doubt Fiegler is Flagg. Golden and Wagner cite evidence such as Fiegler's ability to make himself appear \\"dim\\", an ability shared by Flagg in Eyes of the Dragon, his manipulation of Carol Gerber and her activist friends and Flagg's frequent use of aliases, usually with the initials \\"R.F.\\" Gwendy's Button Box Stephen King's novel Gwendy's Button Box, which he co-wrote with Richard Chizmar, features a mysterious man in black named Richard Farris. Farris gives a young girl, Gwendy Peterson, a 'button box' which, depending on the buttons or levers that are used, can dispense magical treats or cause death and destruction. Chizmar was asked whether or not Richard Farris's initials signified that he was another manifestation of Randall Flagg; his response was \\"Maayyybee... He's definitely mysterious, and it's really obvious there's more to him than meets the eye.\\" Chizmar later revealed during a Reddit AMA session that the initials were indeed indicative of Farris being Flagg. In other media =Film and TV= King wanted to cast a lesser-known actor as Randall Flagg, getting Jamey Sheridan. King was influential in deciding who would play Flagg in the 1994 television adaptation of The Stand. He felt Flagg was the best villain he had ever created, and wanted the actor playing him to be right for the part. Director Mick Garris and the studios wanted to give the role to an established star such as Christopher Walken, James Woods, Willem Dafoe or Jeff Goldblum. King himself had suggested Robert Duvall in his introduction to the novel. Miguel Ferrer, who played Flagg's henchman in the film, was interested in playing the villain. King's idea for the role was someone who \\"would make the ladies' hearts go pitty pat, that looked like the type of guy you would see on the cover of one of those sweet, savage love paperback romances\\". He eventually persuaded Garris to cast a lesser-known actor as Flagg; Garris ultimately chose Jamey Sheridan for the role. Sheridan's performance was generally well received. Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker wrote that the best acting came from Sheridan, who gave the character a \\"grim intensity\\". He commented that Sheridan had \\"leading-man looks\\" with the hair of a \\"dissolute heavy metal star\\", making him \\"unsettling\\" even when not wearing makeup that makes him look like a devil. Douglas E. Winter of Fangoria magazine believed that Sheridan might have been a bit young and \\"zany\\" for the part, but gave a credible performance; he said that Sheridan attacked the role \\"with the swagger of Elvis, the sway of David Koresh and as much craziness as your heart desires (and network TV allows)\\". In February 2011, Warner Bros. announced plans to produce a new feature film adaptation of The Stand. King commented that he would like to see Dutch actor Rutger Hauer in the role of Flagg, but conceded that he was perhaps too old for the part. In August 2014, it was reported that Warner Bros. wanted actor Matthew McConaughey for the role. McConaughey was confirmed to be playing Walter, Flagg's alter-ego, in the film adaptation of The Dark Tower in 2016. Nikolaj Arcel, the film's director and co-writer, said, \\"Matthew is an incredible actor who can do anything. That's how I feel about [Walter]. He could do anything.\\" Arcel described Walter as having \\"a very interesting way of seeing the world. He sees it with a sort of delight, even though he is obviously on the wrong side of the light-and-dark spectrum. He's someone I've been having a lot of fun with.\\" McConaughey described Walter as \\"the Devil having a good time, getting turned on by exposing human hypocrisies wherever he finds them\\". The 2016 miniseries 11.22.63, based on King's 2011 novel 11/22/63, incorporates numerous references to other King stories, including an appearance by Randall Flagg, who is seen cycling through the Dallas throngs just before the assassination of John F. Kennedy in the final episode. In 2019, Finnish actor Jasper P√§√§kk√∂nen was cast as Marten Broadcloak for the pilot of Amazon Prime Video's television adaptation of The Dark Tower,; Amazon ultimately decided not to pursue the series. In the same year, Swedish actor Alexander Skarsg√•rd was cast as Randall Flagg in the CBS All Access miniseries adaptation of The Stand. Showrunner Taylor Elmore described Skarsg√•rd's Flagg with \\"[he] is so beautiful, he is absolutely a lion-like God figure. With perfect hair and‚Ä¶and also, there‚Äôs a softness to Alex‚Äôs performance that I think is fascinating. Alex just plays it where you feel not only sympathy for this character, but you hopefully understand why it‚Äôs so easy for people to gravitate toward him. He‚Äôs just magnetic, he‚Äôs just absolutely fascinating to watch. He‚Äôs galvanizing as a leader.\\" =Comics= Beginning in 2007, Marvel Comics released a series of comics which were a prequel to the Dark Tower novels. Randall Flagg, appearing as Marten Broadcloak and Walter o'Dim, plays a significant role in the series. In April 2009, Marvel released a single-issue comic written by Robin Furth and illustrated by Richard Isanove entitled The Dark Tower: Sorcerer, which focused on the character of Marten Broadcloak- Walter o'Dim. Sorcerer provides an origin for the character that is different from the one King initially wrote, explaining that Walter was the son of the wizard Maerlyn and Selena, Goddess of the Black Moon. Walter was left at the home of a mill owner \\"to learn the ways of men\\". At age 13, Walter burns down his adoptive father's mill before running away to find his true father; Walter's rape is not mentioned. Furth wrote in the comic's afterword that the idea of Maerlyn being Walter's father came from King. The comic also reveals that Marten had poisoned Roland's infant brother. Furth introduced the idea that the Bends o' the Rainbow, 13 magic spheres created by Maerlyn in the distant past, are sentient beings able to project personifications which can interact with other characters. Marten has a sexual relationship with the female personification of Maerlyn's Grapefruit, one of the spheres. This is described as incestuous, since the beings were given life by Maerlyn, Walter's biological father; Marten and the Grapefruit repeatedly call each other as brother and sister. The siblings also refer to the Crimson King as their \\"cousin\\", indicating that Maerlyn is related to him. In her afterword, Furth says that although she conceived these ideas, King approved them. According to the comic, Marten's romantic feelings for Roland's mother trigger jealousy in the Grapefruit who influences Roland to unwittingly kill his mother; in Wizard and Glass, the witch known as Rhea of the C√∂os orchestrates Roland's matricide as revenge for his killing of her pet snake. Enraged, Marten imprisons his \\"sister\\" in the Grapefruit and vows revenge on Roland for his involvement in his beloved's death. Addressing inconsistencies between the novels and the comics, Furth stated that the comics exist on another level of the Tower: \\"a spinoff world, one which is very similar to, but not exactly the same as the one where [the Dark Tower novels] take place\\". On the character of Marten, Furth noted that \\"[he] is one of the scariest characters that Stephen King has ever created. He moves from book to book, bringing chaos and anarchy with him...He is quite a demonic figure, and as such he is one of the great anti- heroes of contemporary popular fiction\\" and that \\"[j]ourneying into Walter's mind is a pretty wild experience and at times a little frightening. You have to travel to very dark places\\". To find Walter's voice, Furth went to John Milton's Paradise Lost, William Blake's Proverbs of Hell, the Biblical Song of Solomon and the writings of Aleister Crowley for inspiration. In his interview with Bev Vincent, Isanove opined that Walter was his favorite character to draw; \\"Jae [Lee, the original artist for the series] established him as almost androgynous. He's always got this bare chest, and he's very feminine in the way he moves, with his hands raised. He's always moving his hands around. He's got this weird face, with a broken nose and greasy hair. He's starting to bald, but he's always got a very white separation in the middle of it. He's just so greasy, he's great to draw. And he still has to be seductive at the same time, so you can't make him repulsive... He's such a great character.\\" Marvel later released a comic book adaptation of The Stand, which began in September 2008 and ran for thirty issues. Writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa described Flagg as \\"The man of nightmares. Or, put another way, our nightmares given human (more or less) form. The dark side of the American Dream...King's 'Walkin' Dude' may not be the Devil, himself, as Mother Abagail says, but he comes pretty damn close...\\" Initially, artist Mike Perkins said he felt \\"Flagg needed to be designed less as a man‚Äîmore as a force of nature. His hair will obscure his features, his face will be almost always in heavy shadow. This is the creature lurking under your bed, in your wardrobe, in your nightmares. Slightly familiar but wholly terrifying\\". Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa later commented on the original idea of hiding Flagg's face: \\"...the further into the book and the adaptation you go, the less feasible that becomes. Stephen spends so much time describing [Flagg]'s features and smiles, you need to show those things\\". Concept and creation Stephen King has said that the inspiration for Flagg's character \\"came out of nowhere\\". King initially named Donald DeFreeze, lead kidnapper in the Patty Hearst case, as his inspiration for Randall Flagg. According to King, he remembered the Patty Hearst case when he began to write a description of DeFreeze: \\"Donald DeFreeze is a dark man\\". He remembered that in photographs of the bank robbery in which Patty Hearst participated that DeFreeze was only partially visible, hidden under a large hat. What he looked like was based on guesses made by people who only saw a portion of him. This inspired King, who then wrote \\"A dark man with no face\\". After reading \\"Once in every generation the plague will fall among them\\", King began writing The Stand and developing the character of Randall Flagg. In 2004, King said that Flagg had been a presence in his writing since the beginning of his career, with the idea coming to him in college. He first wrote a poem, \\"The Dark Man\\", about a man who rides the rails and confesses to murder and rape; written on the back of a placemat in a college restaurant, the one-page poem was published in 1969, but the character never left King's mind. To the author, what made Flagg interesting was \\"the idea of the villain as somebody who was always on the outside looking in, and hated people who had good fellowship and good conversation and friends\\". Characterization and critical reception When Stephen King created the character of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is \\"somebody who's very charismatic, laughs a lot, [is] tremendously attractive to men and women both, and [is] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us\\". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a \\"gigantic evil\\", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, \\"I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s‚Äîhe is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler‚Äîthey're all basically the same guy\\". Although Flagg does not explicitly represent Satan, this does not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: \\"I know all the things that you want and I can give them to you and all you have to do is give me your soul\\". Critics also note Flagg's penchant for evil. Tony Magistrale, author of Stephen King: The Second Decade, Danse Macabre to The Dark Half sees Flagg as a Shakespearian villain, comparing him to Iago, Edmund and Richard III, contending that Flagg is an antihero. Magistrale believes that Flagg's evil is based on his ability to replace peace with conflict and unity with destruction; although he seeks power, it is merely a resource to achieve a greater level of destruction. Author and journalist Heidi Stringell finds Flagg \\"an embodiment of pure evil\\", contending that King sees good and evil as \\"real forces\\"; Flagg's embodiment of evil is confirmed by the fact that \\"he is a killer, a maker of mischief, a liar, and a tempter\\". To Stringell, Flagg's disappearance at the end of The Stand shows that \\"evil ultimately leads nowhere\\". The author calls Flagg a \\"generic hybrid\\" of the archetypical \\"Dark Man and the Trickster\\". To her, the combination of these two characteristics found in different cultural realms forces people to face their \\"flawed humanity\\" with the \\"amorality\\" Flagg represents. Jenifer Paquette, author of Respecting The Stand: A Critical Analysis of Stephen King's Apocalyptic Novel, writes that \\"Flagg's horror is that he looks like an ordinary man, and his behavior is a mockery of humanity‚Äîa terrible insight into the human psyche. King suggests that the thing to fear the most is inside ourselves.\\" Douglas Winter, author of Fear Itself: The Horror Fiction of Stephen King, believes that Flagg epitomizes the Gothic villain‚Äîan \\"atavistic embodiment of evil\\"‚Äîsince his appearance is indistinct, malleable and a \\"collection of masks\\". Flagg symbolizes \\"the inexplicable fear of the return of bygone powers‚Äîboth technological and, as his last name intimates, sociopolitical\\". Like other Gothic villains, Flagg's plans seem to fail at every turn as he seems to need to convince others of his importance. Winter asserts that Flagg is a Miltonic superman who receives his strength from a dark, mysterious source. He compares him to J. R. R. Tolkien's Sauron in The Lord of the Rings: both collapse when directly confronted. Journalist Alissa Stickler describes Flagg as a \\"contemporary medievalist interpretation on the themes of evil, magic and the (d)evil figure\\". She likens Flagg to Merlin, whispering in the ear of Arthur. Stickler notes that Flagg is politically powerful in The Stand and The Eyes of the Dragon; he uses his power differently in each novel, challenging depictions of evil and witchcraft common in medieval times. She explains that there does not appear to be a higher power to which Flagg \\"must appeal to his abilities\\" as there is with traditional evil. Flagg is more of a \\"humanesque evil\\", which works against him as much as it does for him. His supernatural knowledge is fallible, and the customary black-and-white depiction is replaced with an \\"acceptance of a shadowy gray area\\". Stickler says that although Flagg appears \\"terrifying and supernatural\\" as depicted by King, there are no absolutes. She concludes that Flagg represents the medieval monster both past and future, which challenges and yet supports the literary Middle Ages. Flagg's character has its detractors. In his essay \\"The Glass-Eyed Dragon\\", author L. Sprague de Camp criticizes Flagg in Eyes of the Dragon, saying that he is one of the least- believable characters in the book and too evil to be credible. According to de Camp, absolute evil is hard to envision; whereas Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin believed they were improving the world, Flagg only enjoys causing destruction and chaos. De Camp notes that Flagg fails to see that there is no advantage to his actions. Flagg's embodiment of evil is not the only characteristic seen by critics. Author Joseph Reino commented that the character's presence in The Stand was \\"Stephen King's version of a pestilential Big Brother\\". Tony Magistrale revisits the character in a second book, this time comparing him to Norman Mailer. Here, Magistrale states that in The Stand Flagg gives the reader an \\"illustration of King's jaundiced perspective of modern America\\" as he presents the consequences of technology- worship and the sacrifice of \\"moral integrity to the quest for synthetic productivity\\". Flagg's background as a rape victim and its impact on his character have also been explored. Patrick McAleer, author of Inside the Dark Tower Series: Art, Evil and Intertextuality in the Stephen King Novels, argues that Flagg's situation is the most sympathetic of all of King's characters, and his evil may be retribution: \\"[I]n suspending any disbelief in the possibility that reprisal is a reaction to rape, the life of Flagg becomes one that looks to strike a balance for the sexual crime committed against him. And although Flagg's possible search for justice and balance is that which becomes imbalanced and even prejudiced, the mitigating factor here is that Flagg is not an originator of evil - he is just caught up in its web as another wronged individual seeking justice\\". McAleer compares Flagg to Satan in Paradise Lost, suggesting that he may be another \\"fallen angel who has a valid case supporting his devilry\\". While agreeing that Flagg can be seen \\"relishing in evil deeds at almost every juncture\\", he contends that no judgement can be made without the full story and context for his actions.

Some of the cartoons are interactive and game-like. All cartoons are in the Adobe Flash format, although Xiao Xiao #1 was originally in AVI format. It has now been converted to Flash format. \\"Xiao Xiao\\" literally is the Chinese character for \\"small\\" repeated twice in Mandarin Chinese; here this reduplication connotes an affectionate diminutive, an equivalent might be the English expression \\"itty bitty\\" or \\"lil' old\\". Each Xiao Xiao cartoon is given a Chinese title with the adjective \\"Xiao Xiao\\" preceding a descriptive noun phrase. Xiao Xiao #1 was originally titled \\"Xiao Xiao Zuo Pin\\", which translates to \\"A Little Bit of Creative Work\\". Since then each Xiao Xiao cartoon has had a different noun succeeding \\"Xiao Xiao\\" #4 is titled \\"Little Sheriff\\", and #7 is titled \\"Little Movie\\". The term has gradually shifted meaning from the cartoons themselves to the main character, an anonymous black stick-figure in this context it means something akin to \\"little fella\\", appropriate since in most perspectives Xiao Xiao and his fellow stick-people appear tiny and childlike, with disproportionately large heads and small limbs. Xiao Xiao is placed in various dangerous situations to prove his martial arts prowess, often against other stick figures who appear more or less identical to himself. Usually other stick figures are also black, but can be other colors, and Xiao Xiao's perpetual nemesis is the Boss, a purple stick figure who commands the enemy sticks and appears to be Xiao Xiao's only peer in ability. Others have seized on Xiao Xiao's popularity to make animations exploiting the easy-to-draw style of stick figures and minimalist backgrounds, often creating cartoons that are sequels or takeoffs of the official Xiao Xiao cartoons, especially Xiao Xiao #3. Episodes * Xiao Xiao #1 is a simple fight between two stick-figure men, parodying the look of Hong Kong martial arts films by taking the level of violence in the fight to extremes. * Xiao Xiao #2 adds interactivity; the stick-man (Xiao Xiao) faces a series of physical challenges, the outcomes of which depend on the player's timing. The game contains many features that would later become a staple of the Xiao Xiao series, including revamped animation and character design, most notable the introduction of the series' main antagonist, \\"The Boss\\" (although he is not referred to by name until Xiao Xiao #3), a magenta-colored crime boss who acts as the final challenge of the game via a boss fight. * Xiao Xiao #3 is a kung- fu style fight scene in a simple line-drawn building; Xiao Xiao faces off against a seemingly endless series of stick-man opponents (actually around forty enemies) using fast-paced martial arts moves; the simple background, two-dimensional movement, vanishing corpses and regenerating enemies call to mind side-scrolling games. The encounter ends in a final showdown between Xiao Xiao and a purple stick-man labeled \\"Boss\\" (another video game reference) in a fight that parodies multiple scenes from The Matrix (especially Xiao Xiao's last move, a slow-motion air kick which resembles that of Trinity at the beginning of the movie as well as using a sound clip straight from the movie). The visual theme of Xiao Xiao, a plain black stick-man, fighting against a purple stick-man Boss, remains constant throughout the series. This is the best known Xiao Xiao animation, and has been shown on MTV. This Xiao Xiao is one of the more famous and thought of as the one hardest worked on, and is noted to be one of \\"the original stick fighting flash movies\\", and sets the bar for the many stick flash movies. * Xiao Xiao #4 is an interactive first- person shooting game in the style of Virtua Cop, casting the player as Xiao Xiao in the role of a Western-style sheriff complete with cowboy hat and six- shooter. It ends with another scripted fight scene with the purple Boss (which parodies another scene from The Matrix). * Xiao Xiao #5, billed as a \\"Battle to the death... and beyond\\", returns to the two-dimensional fighting-game- reminiscent side-view style of #3. This time Xiao Xiao and the Boss duel using various conventions from anime and manga, exhibiting supernatural powers such as the use of magic spells, the ability to pull weapons out of hammerspace and to continue their battle through astral travel after death. It is notable for its comedic ending, where an ambulance shows up in the middle of the fight, taking the two characters' dead bodies away. The two look at one another, then both run after the ambulance. * Xiao Xiao #6 returns to Xiao Xiao #2's style but this time with a bit more of a plot, forcing the player to button-mash Xiao-Xiao through a barroom brawl. * Xiao Xiao #7 and #8 are the most elaborate of the animations, forsaking the side-view of previous Xiao Xiaos for a fully three-dimensional, cinematic camera view throughout. Once again riffing on films like The Matrix, they depict Xiao Xiao's infiltration of the Boss's mansion and his pursuit after the Boss escapes. #8 ends with a \\"To Be Continued\\" message and has yet to have a sequel, though given that the ending is a bit of an anticlimax, and that two more flashes unrelated to this one came out after it, the message may have been ironic. * Xiao Xiao #9, a departure from the rest of the series, is a fully interactive beat em up game in the style of Final Fight and Streets of Rage where Xiao Xiao uses Guy's moves. Rather than a plain, pen-and-ink background, the background is this time a full-color, realistic re-creation of a desk ostensibly intended to be Zhu's (the computer monitor has a screenshot of Xiao Xiao #3). As with other Xiao Xiaos and the original beat-em-ups that helped inspire them, Xiao Xiao must fight through a series of purple stick-thugs before confronting the Boss. * Xiao Xiao Beer Ad #1 appears to have been created by Zhu as a Chinese advertisement for Heineken beer. This one is one of the more recent movies and also is the first to feature eyes and facial expressions on the stick figures. The movie starts with odd coding lines moving down the screen in a style similar to the matrix and then it zooms in on a Heineken Beer bottle. The scene then changes to the original black Xiao Xiao holding a Heineken Beer Bottle and a bo-staff. Suddenly some enemy stick figures appear and try to steal his beer. Xiao Xiao fights them off with his staff in an action packed fight scene, while keeping the bottle safe. After the second to last grunt falls, one last one appears and attempts to shoot him with a pistol. Xiao Xiao proceeds to skillfully dodge the bullets and then strike the ground with his staff, causing a massive crevice to crack open in the earth and the foe falls right in. The movie ends with Xiao Xiao holding up the bottle and smiling, then it shifts to a Heineken advertisement saying \\"Get Connected, Heineken.\\" * Xiao Xiao Beer Ad #2 is the sequel to Xiao Xiao Beer Ad #1 and uses the same style, as well as picks up immediately where the last one left off. It also appears to be a Chinese Heineken Beer advertisement as well. After the one enemy stick figure falls into the crevice, he then jumps out, hinting that he must be the Boss. This one then proceeds to create physical doubles of himself in a manner similar to Naruto's Shadow Clone. The stick figure and his doubles then charge toward Xiao Xiao. He then fights off the enemy stick figures with his staff and slays every last one of them. After the last one is defeated, a car drives by him. Xiao Xiao scratches the side of the car with his staff. A stick figure then emerges from the back door and he slams him down immediately. After that, Xiao Xiao proceeds to drop the staff and fly into the air, Superman style, and then lands on top of a giant Heineken Beer bottle. At the end, the scene once again shifts to a Heineken advertisement saying \\"Get Connected, Heineken,\\" but with Xiao Xiao standing heroically on top the bottle. * Xiao Xiao Cityplaza or Xiao Xiao: Mall Brawl appears to have been created by Zhu as an advertisement for the CityPlaza mall in Hong Kong; it is an altered version of Xiao Xiao #3 wherein the main character/hero is a red stickman (to match the CityPlaza logo) and the background has been embellished to make it resemble the inside of a shopping mall. The original black Xiao Xiao making a cameo appearance for a short while. He is in the background and doesn't fight, but simply rides past on a pair of ice skates. Also, a scene from Xiao Xiao #3 is also playing on the TV during the fight. Contrary to belief, Xiao Xiao was not initially aired on MTV, but originally was viewed on the Flash animation super community known as Newgrounds.  Characters  *;Xiao Xiao: Xiao Xiao is the protagonist of the series. He is a martial arts expert, as well as an elite assassin. His skills are unmatched, and the only person who comes close is the Boss. *;Bad Boss: Bad Boss is another martial artist, and appears to be some sort of a gang leader and the main antagonist of the series. He is the only one who can give Xiao Xiao a decent fight, and has been beaten by Xiao Xiao on multiple occasions. His name is a reference to most video games, in which a very difficult character near the end is called a boss. The Boss usually appears in magenta. *;The gangs: Various-colored stickfigures who are beat down by Xiao in a matter of seconds. Legal dispute In June 2004, Zhu filed a lawsuit against Nike for plagiarizing his cartoon stickmen in their commercials. Nike representatives denied the accusations, claiming that the stickman figure lacks originality, and is public domain. Zhu eventually won the lawsuit, claiming his copyright on his style and not the stickman, and Nike was ordered to pay $36,000 to the cartoonist.Nike loses \\"Stickman\\" case but decides to appeal... , Lawdit SolicitorsCan a \\"Stickman\\" be original?

Structure Vascular smooth muscle refers to the particular type of smooth muscle found within, and composing the majority of the wall of blood vessels. =Nerve supply= Vascular smooth muscle is innervated primarily by the sympathetic nervous system through adrenergic receptors (adrenoceptors). The three types of adrenoceptors present are: \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2 and \\\\beta_2. The main endogenous agonist of these cell receptors is norepinephrine (NE). The adrenergic receptors exert opposite physiologic effects in the vascular smooth muscle under activation: * \\\\alpha_1 receptors. Under NE binding \\\\alpha_1 receptors cause vasoconstriction (i.e. contraction of the vascular smooth muscle cells decreasing the diameter of the vessels). \\\\alpha_1 receptors are activated in response to shock or low blood pressure as a defensive reaction trying to restore the normal blood pressure. Antagonists of \\\\alpha_1 receptors (doxazosin, prazosin) cause vasodilation (i.e. decrease in vascular smooth muscle tone with increase of vessel diameter and decrease of the blood pressure). (See also receptor antagonist) * \\\\alpha_2 receptors. Agonists of \\\\alpha_2 receptors in the vascular smooth muscle lead to vasoconstriction. However, in clinical practice drugs applied intravenously that are agonists of \\\\alpha_2 receptors (clonidine) lead to powerful vasodilation, which causes a decrease in blood pressure by presynaptic activation of \\\\alpha_2 receptors in the sympathetic ganglia. This presynaptic effect is predominant and completely overrides the vasoconstrictive effect of the \\\\alpha_2 receptors in the vascular smooth muscle. * \\\\beta_2 receptors. Agonism of \\\\beta_2 receptors causes vasodilation and low blood pressure (i.e. the effect is opposite of the one resulting from activation of \\\\alpha_1 and \\\\alpha_2 receptors in the vascular smooth muscle cells). Usage of \\\\beta_2 receptor agonists as hypotensive agents is less widespread due to adverse effects such as unnecessary bronchodilation in lungs and increase in blood sugar levels. Function Vascular smooth muscle contracts or relaxes to change both the volume of blood vessels and the local blood pressure, a mechanism that is responsible for the redistribution of the blood within the body to areas where it is needed (i.e. areas with temporarily enhanced oxygen consumption). Thus the main function of vascular smooth muscle tone is to regulate the caliber of the blood vessels in the body. Excessive vasoconstriction leads to high blood pressure, while excessive vasodilation as in shock leads to low blood pressure. Arteries have a great deal more smooth muscle within their walls than veins, thus their greater wall thickness. This is because they have to carry pumped blood away from the heart to all the organs and tissues that need the oxygenated blood. The endothelial lining of each is similar. Excessive proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells contributes to the progression of pathological conditions, such as vascular inflammation, plaque formation, atherosclerosis, restenosis, and pulmonary hypertension. Recent studies have shown that the majority of cells within atherosclerotic plaque, the predominant cause of heart attack and stroke, are vascular smooth muscle cell derived.

It consisted of AT&T; Corporation, General Instrument Corporation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Philips Consumer Electronics, David Sarnoff Research Center, Thomson Consumer Electronics, and Zenith Electronics Corporation. The Grand Alliance DTV system is the basis for the ATSC standard. Recognizing that earlier proposed systems demonstrated particular strengths in the FCC's Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service (ACATS) testing and evaluation process, the Grand Alliance system was proposed to combine the advantages of all of the previously proposed terrestrial digital HDTV systems. At the time of its inception, the Grand Alliance HDTV system was specified to include: * Flexible picture formats with a header/Descriptor approach, allowing the inclusion of both 1050 and 787.5 raster formats. * Progressive scanning and square pixel capabilities in both raster formats. * Interlaced scanning and rectangular pixel formats. * Video compression based on MPEG-2, with additional syntax elements that represent contributions from each previously proposed system. * A packetized, prioritized data format, providing flexibility of services and extensibility. Audio and transmission systems had not been decided at the time of the GA agreement. Five channel audio was specified, but a decision among the Dolby AC-3, multi-channel MUSICAM audio, and MIT \\"AC\\" systems had not yet been made. Candidate transmission approaches included QAM, Spectrally-Shaped QAM, 6 VSB (with trellis code) and 4/2 VSB. COFDM had been proposed by third parties, but was rejected as not being mature, and not offering fringe-area coverage equivalent to analog transmission. A thorough analysis of service area, interference characteristics, transmission robustness and system attributes would be performed to determine the \\"best approach.\\" In the end, 1080, 720 and 480-line resolutions were implemented at various aspect ratios and frame rates, with progressive and interlaced scanning (the so-called \\"18 formats\\"), together with 8-VSB modulation and Dolby AC-3 audio. However, the selection of transmission and audio systems was not without controversy. The choice of 8-VSB was later criticised by several groups as being inferior to COFDM under conditions of multipath interference. Improvements in receiver designs would later render this apparently moot. With MUSICAM originally faltering during GA testing, the GA issued a statement finding the MPEG-2 audio system to be \\"essentially equivalent\\" to Dolby, but only after the Dolby selection had been made. Later, a story emerged that MIT had entered into an agreement with Dolby whereupon the university would be awarded a large sum if the MUSICAM system was rejected.MIT Getting Millions For Digital TV Deal Following a five-year lawsuit for breach of contract, MIT and its GA representative received a total of $30 million from Dolby, after the litigants reached a last-minute out-of- court settlement. Dolby also offered an incentive for Zenith to switch their vote (which they did), however it is unknown whether they accepted the offer.

Thomas Crecquillon or Cr√©quillon ( ‚Äì probably early 1557) was a Franco-Flemish school composer of the Renaissance. While his place of birth is unknown, it was probably within the region loosely known at the time as the Low Countries, and he probably died at B√©thune. Biography Very little is known about his early life. He was a priest and a member of the chapel of Emperor Charles V, but whether he was ma√Ætre de chapelle or merely a singer is still a matter of dispute; the surviving documents are contradictory. Later he seems to have held positions at Dendermonde, B√©thune, Leuven, and Namur. Unlike many of the composers of the Franco-Flemish school, he seems never to have left his home region for Italy or other parts of Europe. Crecquillon was retired by 1555, and most likely he died in 1557, probably a victim of the serious outbreak of the plague in B√©thune that year. The location of his burial remains a mystery, and no likeness of Crecquillon is known to exist. Crecquillon's music was highly regarded by his contemporaries, and shows a harmonic and melodic smoothness which prefigures the culminating polyphonic style of Palestrina. He wrote twelve masses, more than 100 motets and almost 200 chansons. Stylistically he uses points of imitation, rather in the manner of Josquin des Prez, in almost all of his sacred works (the masses and motets), following the contemporary trend toward pervading imitation and polyphonic complexity. Unlike Josquin, however, Crecquillon rarely varies his texture for dramatic effect, preferring smoothness and consistency. His secular chansons, unlike most of those by other composers of the same time, also use pervading imitation, although as is normal in a lighter form of music, they make considerable use of repetition (for example of the final phrase). Because they were imitative, it was Crecquillon's chansons which provided some of the best models for the later development of the instrumental canzona, the instrumental form which developed directly from the chanson. Many of his chansons were arranged for instruments, especially lute. The printers Petrus Phalesius the Elder (of Leuven) and Tielman Susato (of Antwerp) published more music by him than by any other composer, which shows the extent of his reputation at the time, though his music is not as often recorded today as is that of many of the Netherlanders working at the same time. His name is pronounced \\"toh-MAH krehk-kee-YON.\\" Some historical sources spell the composer's last name with an acute accent mark above its \\"e\\", then the composer's last name is actually pronounced \\"krayk- kee-YON.\\" Scores The complete musical works of Thomas Crecquillon (the Opera Omnia) were published in twenty volumes, between 1974 and 2011, by the American Institute of Musicology.

Built to strengthen Commodore Isaac Chauncey's squadron on Lake Ontario, Sylph was laid down on 26 July 1813 at Sackett's Harbor, New York, by Henry Eckford; and launched on 18 August 1813. Service history Three days later, the new schooner reinforced Chauncey's fleet on Lake Ontario. On the afternoon of 11 September, she began a long-range, running battle off the mouth of the Genesee River. During the three and one-half hour engagement, the American squadron suffered no casualties nor damage while the Royal Navy had a midshipman and three seamen killed and seven wounded. One of their brigs was seriously damaged before the British squadron escaped into Amherst Bay. Sylph got into action again on the 28th when the two fleets met in York Bay. However, since she was towing a slower schooner throughout the engagement, she was unable to get close to the fleeing British ships, instead firing at them from a great distance as her contribution to the American victory. Chauncey broke off the pursuit about mid-afternoon, lest his fleet be endangered by a threatening storm. Bad weather lasted until the evening of the 31st. On 2 October, the British fleet got underway and escaped. Chauncey hunted for the English ships and, on the afternoon of the 5th, came upon seven vessels. The American ship captured five; one other was burned by her crew to prevent capture and one managed to escape. Two of the prizes proved to be HMS Confiance and HMS Hamilton, which were the former American ships and . Thereafter, the British fleet remained in Kingston, Ontario, where they were blockaded until the end of November when cold weather closed navigation on the lake for the winter. During the off-season, both fleets engaged in a shipbuilding race in an effort to achieve naval superiority in 1814. During this period, Sylph was rerigged as a brig, and her armament was changed to 2 √ó 9-pounder and 16 √ó 24-pounder carronades. In the spring of 1814, the British squadron was first to venture out upon the lake. On 5 May, they captured the American base at Oswego, New York; and then proceeded to Sacketts Harbor which they blockaded until 6 June. The American fleet got underway on 31 July and sailed up to the head of the lake where Chauncey intercepted the British brig Sir Sydney Smith. He ordered Sylph to sail into shoal water to destroy the brig but, before Sylph could do so, the British vessel's crew ran her aground and burned her. Chauncey then took his squadron to Kingston where he blockaded the British fleet until winter ended navigation. The Treaty of Ghent obviated further naval operations on the Great Lakes. Sylph was laid up at Sacketts Harbor until 1823 when she was reported sunk and decayed. Her hulk was sold before 1825.

It is the site of Silver Springs, a group of artesian springs and a historic tourist attraction that is now part of Silver Springs State Park. The community is part of the Ocala metropolitan area. One of Florida's first tourist attractions, the springs drew visitors even before the U.S. Civil War. Glass-bottom boats have been a popular way to see the complex. A small amusement park with various animals, a concert stage, a carousel, and exhibits also developed. History Steamboat and railroad at Silver Springs in 1886. Silver Springs was founded in 1852. Since the mid-19th century, the natural environment of Silver Springs has attracted visitors from throughout the United States. Glass-bottom boat tours of the springs began in the late 1870s. In the 1920s, W. Carl Ray and W.M. \\"Shorty\\" Davidson, after leasing the land from Ed Carmichael (upon whose death the springs were left to the University of Florida), developed the land around the headwaters of the Silver River into an attraction that eventually became known as Silver Springs Nature Theme Park. The attraction featured native animal exhibits, amusement rides, and 30 or 90-minute glass-bottom boat tours of the springs. The 1934 'Princess Donna' is the oldest and only remaining operational boat from this by gone era. The \\"Princess Donna' currently operates on Jug Creek in Bokeelia Florida. In 2013, the State of Florida took over operations of Silver Springs and combined it with the adjacent Silver River State Park to form the new Silver Springs State Park. The T. W. Randall House on the National Register of Historic Places is located to the northeast. Several defunct tourist attractions were once located near Silver Springs. The Western-themed Six Gun Territory theme park, which included several attractions such as the Southern Railway & Six Gun narrow gauge railroad, operated from 1963 to 1984. The Wild Waters water park also existed in Silver Springs and operated from 1978 to 2016. Silver Springs was \\"whites only\\" until 1967. From 1949 to 1969, African Americans were served by nearby Paradise Park, Florida, which closed when Silver Springs integrated racially.

It was founded in 1995 by Rich Egan and Jon Cohen. The label focuses on rock, but features artists in a variety of other genres including folk, soul, electronic, and pop. It is home to artists such as The 1975, Death Spells, Eels, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes, CRUISR, Active Child, PJ Harvey, School of Seven Bells, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, James Vincent McMorrow, Black Joe Lewis, Wake Owl, Blitzen Trapper, and Bombay Bicycle Club. Originally, Vagrant Records was mostly focused on emo bands such as Dashboard Confessional, Saves the Day, The Get Up Kids, Senses Fail, and Alkaline Trio. In 2014, Vagrant was acquired by BMG Rights Management. Co-founder Jon Cohen then became BMG's executive vice president of recorded music, until he left the company in September 2017. It remains to be distributed autonomously (outside of BMG's main distribution partner Warner Music Group), by affiliated labels in selected countries. History The first band signed by Vagrant Records was Boxer and their album, The Hurt Process, released on May 5, 1998. The pop-punk album notably featured drummer Chris Pennie, who would go on to play with Dillinger Escape Plan and Coheed and Cambria. =The Get Up Kids= In 1999, Vagrant Records signed Kansas City, Missouri, band, The Get Up Kids, and the band's Vagrant debut, Something to Write Home About, was released in September 1999. Egan and Cohen borrowed $50,000 from Cohen's parents to fund the recording of the Get Up Kids album, derived from the mortgaging of the family house.Alternative Press Issue 204 \\"Say Goodnight, Mean Goodbye: The Oral History of The Get Up Kids\\" The album was wildly successful, and single- handedly made Vagrant Records one of the top independent labels in the country. =Rapid growth= They signed Los Angeles punk rock trio Automatic 7 and released the band's 2nd album Begger's Life on July 25, 2000. They followed this by signing and releasing albums from heavyweights in the emo scene like Alkaline Trio, Saves the Day, and Dashboard Confessional. Dashboard Confessional's video for Screaming Infidelities, directed by Maureen Egan and Matthew Barry, earned Vagrant the MTV2 award at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards. Rich Egan is cited as saying the MTV Video Music Award win \\"changed everything\\" for the label. =Paul Westerberg= The label then went on to release solo material from The Replacements frontman, Paul Westerberg, signifying an initial departure from its roots of nineties punk and emo. =Genre diversification= They soon signed Eels and released their album Blinking Lights and Other Revelations. In 2005, the label acquired New York City indie label Startime International, with whom they co-released albums from The French Kicks and The Futureheads. During that time, Vagrant signed The Hold Steady and The Lemonheads. =Poquito Records= In 2006, Vagrant formed a children's label imprint, Poquito Records, and released Vagrant artist The New Amsterdams' side-project The Terrible Twos' debut album If You Ever See an Owl. =Density Records= In 2007, Vagrant formed another imprint label, Density Records, which will release heavier material than has traditionally been released on the label. On August 5, 2009, Rammstein, the Berlin-based industrial metal sextet, well known for its controversial and fiery live performances, signed a US marketing and distribution deal with Vagrant Records.

Owned is a slang word that originated among 1990s hackers, where it referred to \\"rooting\\" or gaining administrative control over someone else's computer. The term eventually spread to gamers, who used the term to mean defeat in gaming. Other variations of the word owned include own3d, 0wn3d, pwned, and pooned, terms which incorporate elements of leetspeak. In 2009, Newgrounds described a security vulnerability in ActiveX as leaving Windows XP and Windows 2003 Server users open to a \\"Browse-And-Get- Owned\\" attack.Tom Fulp, \\"Microsoft Warns Of 'Browse-And-Get-Owned' Attack\\", InformationWeek, July 7, 2009. Owned has now spread beyond computer and gaming contexts and become part of standard slang, especially in social media, and is typically used to signify severe defeat or humiliation, usually in an amusing way or through the dominance of an opposing party, in diverse contexts ranging from sports to politics (e.g. \\"Obama owns Fox News\\" or \\"Trump owns CNN\\").Owned from the Jargon File, version 4.4.7. Retrieved 2007-09-22  Origins  The term's original usage was close to that of the traditional meaning of the word own ‚Äì for instance, \\"I owned the network at MIT\\" indicated that the speaker had cracked the servers and had the same root-level privileges that the legitimate owner of the servers had. Some more examples are \\"I owned you\\" and \\"You got owned\\". Owned,or Ownded a later variant, became more common in the late 1990s, as did the more abstract usage referring to any compromised security mechanism. By 1997, Owned was regularly used in website defacements.  Usage in gaming  The term \\"owned\\" subsequently spread to gaming circles, where it was used to refer to defeat in a game. For example, if a player makes a particularly impressive kill shot or wins a match by an appreciable margin in a multiplayer video game, it is not uncommon for him or her to say owned to the loser(s), as a manifestation of victory, a taunt, or provocation. Ownage has become a modern equivalent to \\"turkey shoot\\"; applicable when an experienced faction predictably annihilates a beginner or disadvantaged faction. In slang form, owned can be an adjective (He is owned), owning can be a verb (He is totally owning that guy.), and ownage can be a noun. The phrase \\"own\\" can not only refer to defeating one particular player or team, but it can also be used to indicate total domination of the competition. The racing video game Need for Speed: Nitro follows this definition by awarding a special bonus called \\"Own it\\", in which a player earns points for every second they spend in first place, while also expressing their dominance visually to other opponents by painting every portion of the course where they lead with their tag and colors. Usage in politics In the late 2010s, the concept of ownage (specifically, \\"owning the libs\\") has become a defining ethos of right-wing politics in the United States. Ben Shapiro describes the concept in the National Review: In other words, Republicans and conservatives may often prioritize opportunities to make Democrats and liberals feel bad, sometimes to a greater degree than actual policy achievement. Statements intended to upset liberals tend to be about topics known as culture war issues. This pugilistic style of politics is especially popular with Donald Trump and his supporters. However, it is a controversial practice inside and outside the Republican party. For example, Nikki Haley said \\"I know that it's fun and that it can feel good, but step back and think about what you're accomplishing when you do this ‚Äî are you persuading anyone?\\" References Category:Internet culture Category:Internet forum terminology Category:Internet slang de:Computerspieler-Jargon#O fr:Lexique du jeu vid√©o ","title":"Owned"},{"id":"903642","text":"The first USS Oneida was a brig of war in the United States Navy during the War of 1812. Oneida was built at Oswego, New York 1808‚Äì1809, under contract awarded by her first commanding officer, Lieutenant M. T. Woolsey, to Henry Eckford and Christian Bergh. Although her displacement was 243 tons by carpenter's measurement, her draft could compare with a sloop of 80 tons. This enabled her to enter the rivers feeding Lake Ontario without fear of grounding. She was delivered by the contractors in the spring of 1809, but was not equipped and sent upon the lake until the fall of 1810. War of 1812 Oneida operated principally from Sackets Harbor, New York, not far from the commencement of the St. Lawrence, while the British port of Kingston lay nearly opposite in Canada. =First Battle of Sacket's Harbor= On 5 June 1812, Oneida captured the British schooner Lord Nelson, while enforcing the Embargo Act of 1807. On 19 July, the British squadron sailed on Sackets Harbor where Oneida and her prize were anchored. After failing to gain the open lake, Oneida anchored again near a bank in a position to rake the harbor entrance. She mounted the guns from her off side ashore and presented a full battery. After an exchange of cannonade, of two hours duration, the British squadron broke off the engagement and sailed for Kingston, Canada. =USS Oneida vs HMS Royal George= Depiction of the engagement of the Oneida and Royal George in Kingston harbour, 10 November 1812. On 8 November, Oneida, flying the broad pennant of Commodore Isaac Chauncey, sailed from Sackets Harbor to intercept British ships conveying supplies to the Army at Kingston. The sloop was sighted and chased into the Bay of Quinte and lost sight of during the night. Sighted again the following morning, the chase was resumed. Oneida brought up the rear of the squadron to allow the heavy guns of her schooners to open way for a close attack. Royal George cut her mooring cables and attempted to make further headway up the channel, finally making fast to a wharf under the protection of troop muskets. Royal George suffered extensive damage, and Oneida had some damage aloft with one seaman killed and three wounded, but a gale ended the engagement and the Americans returned to Sackets Harbor. Battle of York On 25 April 1813, along with other ships of the American squadron, Oneida set sail from Sackets Harbor and arrived off York, Canada (now Toronto) on 27 April with troops under General Zebulon Pike embarked. Boats were hoisted out and within two hours the brigade was ashore, soon capturing York despite the loss of General Pike. On the night of 26 May she again embarked troops and artillery and set sail with the squadron for Fort George, Canada. A landing was made about 9 a.m. on 27 May, and by noon the town and fort were taken. Oneida made a second unopposed landing at York on 27 July liberating prisoners and seizing provisions. On 31 July 1814, Oneida made for the Niagara River to blockade British ships anchored there. She was assisted by the brig and the schooner , while the remainder of the American Squadron blockaded Kingston. The blockade was lifted in September 1814, and Oneida returned to Sackets Harbor. Ice closed the lake in November, and peace was declared the following month. =Postwar= Oneida was sold 15 May 1815, but afterwards was repurchased by the Navy, laid up at Sackets Harbor, and finally sold in 1825 to a timber company in the village of Clayton, New York. Oneida worked as a timber ship for several years before sinking in French Creek Bay near Clayton sometime in the 1830s. One of the ship's cannons is currently in Clayton's Memorial Park, while one of its anchors is in the possession of French Creek Bay Marina.

It is a G0V star, and is thus very similar to the Sun. Because it is located at a distance of about 159 light years, it is not visible to the unaided eye. With good binoculars or small telescope it should be easily detectable. HD 209458 In 1999, two teams working independently (one team consisted of astronomers at the Geneva Observatory, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and the Wise Observatory; the second group was the California and Carnegie Planet Search team) discovered an extrasolar planet orbiting the star by using the radial velocity planet search method. Soon after the discovery, separate teams led by David Charbonneau and Gregory W. Henry were able to detect a transit of the planet across the surface of the star making it the first known transiting extrasolar planet. The planet received the designation HD 209458 b. Because the planet transits the star, the star is dimmed by about 2% every 3.5 days making it an extrinsic variable. The variable star designation for HD 209458 is V376 Pegasi. It is the prototype of the variable class \\"EP\\" in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars, defined as stars showing eclipses by their planets. Planetary system HD 209458 b is an extrasolar planet that orbits the Sun-like star HD 209458 in the constellation Pegasus. Spectroscopic studies first revealed the presence of a planet around HD 209458 on November 5, 1999. The planet is now under even more public scrutiny with the announcement that its atmosphere contains water vapor. Astronomers had made careful photometric measurements of several stars known to be orbited by planets, in the hope that they might observe a dip in brightness caused by the transit of the planet across the star's face. This would require the planet's orbit to be inclined such that it would pass between the Earth and the star, and previously no transits had been detected. Travis Barman at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona analyzed the emission spectrum of this planet, and believes that its atmosphere contains water, although previous research suggests that the atmosphere is composed mostly of silicate clouds.

In the mid 1980s, 1ZB Auckland lost a number of its key on-air personalities to privately owned Radio i, including Merv Smith who had hosted 1ZB's breakfast programme for over twenty years. The station's ratings subsequently plummeted as large numbers of listeners migrated to other stations. In 1987 a decision was made to re-launch 1ZB as a talkback station branded as Newstalk 1ZB. While the change was not popular initially the station showed growth by the end of the first year and by 1989 the breakfast show presented by Paul Holmes was the number one show in Auckland. In February 1993, in Auckland, Newstalk 1ZB began broadcasting on 89.4 FM as well as the original 1080 AM when local station 89X (formerly 89FM) ceased to operate, Radio New Zealand purchased this station a year earlier and chose to close it down and use the frequency for Newstalk 1ZB. The current Newstalk ZB nationwide 0800 number (0800 80 10 80) actually comes from the original 1080AM frequency in Auckland that is still in use today. During the late eighties and early nineties Radio New Zealand switched many of their local heritage stations to FM but retained the AM frequency in each region running the same programme on both frequencies. Following the success of the talkback format in Auckland a decision was made to switch 2ZB Wellington and 3ZB Christchurch to a talkback format in 1991. At the same time new FM music stations were established in Wellington and Christchurch, these stations were B90 FM (Wellington) and B98 FM (Christchurch). In the early nineties many of the Radio New Zealand local stations that had switched to FM began running morning talkback shows on the AM frequency while continuing to play music on the FM frequency. In 1993 and 1994 the local Radio New Zealand station in some regions were rebranded with the Classic Hits name and the AM frequency was used to roll out the station across New Zealand, it was at this point Newstalk 1ZB was rebranded as Newstalk ZB. Initially those regions that ran local talkback shows on the AM frequency continued to do so and Wellington and Christchurch were initially local versions of Newstalk ZB. =1996‚Äì2002= In 1996 Radio New Zealand sold their commercial operation and Newstalk ZB, along with Classic Hits and ZM, became part of The Radio Network. In 2001 Newstalk ZB was further expanded into the smaller community markets in New Zealand. The smaller regions did not have their local stations rebranded as Classic Hits during the early nineties and many of these stations were still only broadcasting on AM frequencies. These stations were consolidated together in 1998 to become part of the Community Radio Network, in 2001 all Community Radio Network stations were rebranded as Classic Hits and at this point began broadcasting on FM if the station was already on FM leaving the AM frequency to now be used to broadcast Newstalk ZB. Today most Newstalk ZB stations run complete networked programming, however Wellington and Christchurch still have a local show in the mornings between 9 am and 12 pm. =2002‚Äì2009= Newstalk ZB's Auckland audience dropped dramatically in 2002 as music radio stations became more popular, raising questions about the future viability of the network. However, in 2013 the station had the highest market share of any commercial station nationwide. Paul Holmes caused controversy in September 2003, after he referred to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan as a \\"cheeky darkie\\". Holmes was labelled racist and faced pressure to resign. He issued two nationwide apologies, sent a letter of apology to Annan and met with members of the New Zealand Ghanaian community. The incident also affected his television show, which lost the sponsorship of Mitsubishi Motors. The Radio Network took disciplinary action against him, put their staff through a training seminar on racism run by race relations commissioner Joris de Bres, and a $10,000 donation was made to Save the Children. The Broadcasting Standards Authority refused to uphold 10 complaints against Holmes for the complaint, leading one complainant to appeal the decision in the High Court. On the same breakfast show Holmes asked whether the female journalists were making journalism \\"ignorant and bitchy\\", particularly at certain times of the month. The authority found the comments were \\"insulting and inappropriate\\" but did not amount to denigrating and discriminating against women journalists. Race relations commissioner Joris de Bres received a record number of complaints about the issue, a record later broken by a racially polarising and profanity-laden letter written by Hone Harawira. The comment also set a precedent, when former All Black Andy Haden faced calls to resign as a 2011 Rugby World Cup ambassador, after apologising for describing Pacific Island rugby players as \\"darkies\\". Prime minister John Key and sports minister Murray McCully said both Haden and Holmes used the word \\"darkies\\" in similarly offensive ways, and the public needed to forgive them in similar ways. Artist Ralph Hotere responded to Holmes' \\"cheeky darky\\" comment with a series of artworks. One, White Drip to Mister Paul Holmes, was a 2.7-metre long piece of corrugated iron painted in black, with a drip of white paint extending nearly the full length of the work. 'To Mister Paul Holmes' is stenciled on the top of the piece, which is now one of his signature works. Holmes was apologetic and regretful about using the phrase, but later argued there was a fine line between humour and offense. The phrase featured on a commemorative tea towel, and fellow broadcaster John Hawkesby remembered Holmes as a \\"cheeky little whitey\\" at his funeral in 2013. =2009‚Äì2011= imploded after it sustained major damage in the 2012 earthquake. The network went through a process of restructuring during the Global Financial Crisis, removing one reporter position in the Parliamentary press gallery, one position in Wellington, one position in Auckland, and five reporting, hosting and producing roles in Christchurch. The Christchurch local news and sport bulletins and local morning show were later reintroduced, with NZME investing $7.8 million for a 17-year license for its 100.1 FM Christchurch frequency. Following the Christchurch earthquake on 4 September 2010 and the major aftershock on 22 February 2011 programming in Christchurch was greatly affected. After both earthquakes the station broadcast in place of other radio stations in Christchurch operated by The Radio Network, the local studios located in Worcester Street in Christchurch were evacuated. Local news services in Christchurch were replaced temporarily with the network news feed which mostly contained news stories related to the quake heard by all of New Zealand. Local news readers reported news about the quake for all of New Zealand. The local morning show remained on the air but was broadcast from a temporary location. Following the first earthquake this was at the Whitebait Studios in Christchurch, and following the February earthquake in February it was a hotel in Christchurch. The Radio Network Christchurch never returned to their Worcester Street premises and eventually set up in a new location. The building was taken down in August 2012, in New Zealand's first ever controlled building demolition with explosives. =2011‚Äìpresent= The TNS T2 2013 commercial radio survey showed the network had 11.4% of audiences aged over 10, and had the most listened-to breakfast show in the country. It came as Rachel Smalley became host of the newly created Early Edition programme. The same survey in 2014 showed Newstalk ZB lost 0.3% market share but gained 7,600 listeners during a time when other NZME radio stations were in decline. It has also been observed that ZB and Mai FM are the only stations that can be received by car radios in used imported cars from Japan ‚Äî of which New Zealand is a large market ‚Äì due to the Japanese FM band spanning 76‚Äì90 MHz instead of the standard 88‚Äì108 MHz band. Host Rachel Smalley apologised in April 2014 after describing New Zealand women over 72 kilograms as \\"heifers\\" and a \\"bunch of lardos\\" during an ad break when she believed her microphone was off. The comments were reported and criticised in several local and international media outlets, including news.com.au and the Daily Mail. In a tearful apology the following morning, she described her comments as deeply offensive, stupid and judgemental and said she deeply regretted her choice of words. The Broadcasting Standards Authority rejected complaints against the comments, saying they were neither calculated nor deliberate. Blogger Cameron Slater was a regular commentator on the drive programme for several years, and has been both critical and supportive of the station's positions in the past. In 2013, the Broadcasting Standards Authority rejected complaints against Slater over his suggestions that openly gay Labour MP Grant Robertson \\"enjoys being stabbed from behind\\" ‚Äì and Newstalk ZB defended what they argued was \\"robust, irreverent, edgy\\" debate. In 2014, he participated in a series of one-hour pre-election panel discussions on the drive programme. He retained the position following the release of the Nicky Hager book Dirty Politics. However, left-wing commentators calling for him to be taken off-air or resign. The Broadcasting Standards Authority upheld a complaint about an editorial on the Israeli shelling of UNRWA Gaza shelters during the Israel-Gaza conflict. The authority found the programme had overstated the number of people killed in the bombing of the Rafah Preparatory A Boys School and had wrongly condemned Israel of targeting civilians and killing every civilian inside. Newstalk ZB argued the number of fatalities was irrelevant to the broader point, but the authority said the right to express opinions in editorials did not justify factually inaccurate and misleading statements. According to Lonely Planet in 2014, the station provided a forum for \\"the most lively discussions on New Zealand issues\\". Conspiracy theorists, veganism advocates, victims of sexual assault, and housing activists have called talkback. Regular callers include an urban MƒÅori man, a state housing beneficiary, a security guard, a Timaru pensioner, a West Coast grandmother, a dairy farmer, a Dutch butcher and several taxi drivers.  News  Newstalk ZB operates Newstalk ZB News from its Auckland news centre, producing live bulletins for the national ZB network. Wellington and Christchurch both broadcast live local news bulletins during the breakfast show, Auckland has live local bulletins at 7.00am and 8.00am, and other stations carry network bulletins every half-hour from 5am to 12am and hourly from 12am to 5am. Regional newsrooms previously provided each station with local news segments during the breakfast show. Newstalk ZB's pip sting, headlines segmented bulletin structure and \\"Keep up with Newstalk ZB\\" tagline were removed in December 2014, replaced with a single continuous bulletin, new theme music and \\"Now You're in the Now\\" tagline. The news service covers stories, from industrial relations to prisoner rehabilitation. It extensively covers crime and court proceedings, but was criticised for publishing a wire story about the verdict against lawyer Davina Murray in 2013. Network weekday newsreaders include Niva Retimanu (Breakfast) and Kay Gregory (Evenings/Overnights). = History = Newstalk ZB News began as Independent Radio News (IRN), a news service played on most independently owned and operated radio stations in New Zealand during the 1980s and 1990s. The majority of New Zealand radio stations not owned by Radio New Zealand (RNZ) used this news and sport service usually followed by the station's own local news and weather forecast. In 1996 RNZ sold its commercial operation and The Radio Network (TRN) was formed, at the time TRN purchased IRN. TRN branded the news service on its own stations as Radio Network News while the news service continued to be called IRN on stations not owned by TRN despite the news coming from the same place. RNZ continued to operate its own news service on RNZ National and RNZ Concert, the two non- commercial stations that were not sold. By 2000 a large number of independent radio stations had been taken over by RadioWorks, which did not want to pay for a news service operated by its main competitor and chose to start their own news service. After CanWest purchased RadioWorks the news service became known as the Global News Service (Global is the same name as Television network in Canada operated by CanWest), and in early 2005 it was again renamed to Radio Live News. Similarly, IRN News later became Newstalk ZB News. Since 2016 a single news bulletin sourced from the NZME newsroom is heard on every NZME radio station (apart from Newstalk ZB) during breakfast and other parts of the day. = Affiliate Service = The Newstalk ZB Affiliates Unit is based in the Auckland newsroom, and records a variety of hourly bulletins for other stations of NZME Radio and sells its bulletins to a number of external clients including Radio 1XX ‚Äì One Double-X in Whakatane and the Eastern Bay of Plenty.

It held commentary rights for most cricket matches, international and domestic rugby union games, NRL rugby league games, trans-Tasman basketball and New Zealand tennis tournaments. The network also updated developments at golfing events, bowls tournaments and other sporting events. At other times Radio Sport played talkback and hourly news and sports updates. History =Sports Roundup= Sports Roundup Radio Sport began as Sports Roundup, a Radio New Zealand programme during the 1980s and early 1990s that provided live commentary of summer sports like cricket. It was broadcast on several frequencies around the country on a time-share with the AM Network on frequencies historically used for The Concert Programme. =Radio Sport= Radio Sport Sports Roundup was replaced with dedicated Radio Sport network through its privatisation of the sports commentary department in 1996. The station was targeted at male sports fans from its outset. As Newstalk ZB's sister network, Radio Sport provided all sports news coverage for the Newstalk ZB news service carried by Newstalk ZB, Classic Hits FM, ZMFM, Radio Rhema, Radio Hauraki, Southern Star, Coast and Life FM since its inception. Unless the network was taking live commentary from a sporting event, Radio Sport simulcasted Newstalk ZB Monday-Thursday 19:00‚Äì20:00 and weekends 6:00‚Äì9:00 and 12:00‚Äì18:00. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting most major sporting events, Radio Sport was closed \\"indefinitely\\" at 1pm on 30 March 2020 until further notice and has been replaced with a simulcast of Newstalk ZB. Programmes Radio Sport consisted of nationally broadcast domestic and international sports programming. Local opt-outs were limited to ad breaks and some seasonal programming. Radio Sport also provided a sports-based news service, produced in house, and updated at regular intervals. = Early Breakfast = The Country 'Early Edition' presented by Rowena Duncam aired Monday-Friday from 5am until 6am from the Dunedin Studios, and featured highlights of the 12PM show and a cross to the Radio Sport Breakfast team. = Breakfast = Radio Sport's programming was led by its breakfast programme. Since 2017 the breakfast programme was Radio Sport Breakfast with Kent Johns, Nathan Rarere and Marc Peard from 6am until 9am. The programme also featured News and Sport Every 30 minutes. Until 17 July 2008 the programme was presented by ONE News sports presenter Tony Veitch, but Veitch resigned from his roles with Radio Sport and ONE News after allegations that Veitch assaulted his girlfriend in 2006. Veitch confessed on 8 July 2008 that such allegations were true, at a press conference and resigned on 17 July. The vacancy was filled by former drive-time presenter D'Arcy Waldegrave, with former New Zealand cricketer Mark Richardson as his co-host. Richardson was joined by Andrew Mulligan joining him in late 2013 to host the Crowd Goes Wild Breakfast. In 2015 it was announced that Richardson was to leave the show in the middle of that year, with former New Zealand cricketer Simon Doull to take over as co-host a fortnight after Richardson's departure. The Crowd Goes Wild Breakfast remained on air until the end of 2016. = Mornings = Radio Sport Mornings was hosted by Jason Pine & Sam Hewitt.

The well-known Navaratnas include the ones in the courts of the legendary emperor Vikramaditya, the Mughal emperor Akbar, and the feudal lord Raja Krishnachandra.  Vikramaditya's Navaratnas  Vikramaditya was a legendary emperor, who ruled from Ujjain; he is generally identified with the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II. According to folk tradition, his court had 9 famous scholars. The earliest source that mentions this legend is Jyotirvidabharana (22.10), a treatise attributed to Kalidasa. According to this text, the following 9 scholars (including Kalidasa himself) attended Vikramaditya's court: However, Jyotirvidabharana is considered a literary forgery of a date later than Kalidasa by multiple scholars. V. V. Mirashi dates the work to 12th century, and points out that it could not have been composed by Kalidasa, because it contains grammatical faults. There is no mention of such \\"Navaratnas\\" in earlier literature. D. C. Sircar calls this tradition \\"absolutely worthless for historical purposes\\". There is no historical evidence to show that these nine scholars were contemporary figures or proteges of the same king. Vararuchi is believed to have lived around 3rd or 4th century CE. The period of Kalidasa is debated, but most historians place him around 5th century CE. Varahamihira is known to have lived in 6th century CE. Dhanavantari was the author of a medical glossary (Nighantu); his period is uncertain. Amarasimha cannot be dated with certainty either, but his lexicon utilizes the works of Dhanavantari and Kalidasa; therefore, he cannot be dated to 1st century BCE, when the legendary Vikramaditya is said to have established the Vikrama Samvat in 57 BCE. Not much is known about Shanku, Vetalabhatta, Kshapanaka and Ghatakarpara. Some Jain writers identify Siddhasena Divakara as Kshapanaka, but this claim is not accepted by historians. Kalidasa is the only figure whose association with Vikramaditya is mentioned in works earlier than Jyotirvidabharana. Rajasekhara's KƒÅvyamimƒÅ·πÉsa (10th century), Bhoja's Sringara Prakasa (11th century) and Kshemendra's Auchitya-Vichara-Charcha (11th century) mention that Vikramaditya sent Kalidasa as his ambassador to the Kuntala country (identified with present-day Uttara Kannada).

Jones was built at Sacketts Harbor, New York, for service in Commodore Isaac Chauncey's fleet on Lake Ontario and was launched on 10 April 1814. Most of the cannon for the new American ships had not reached Sackett's Harbor on 19 May when the British fleet arrived off the American base and established a strict blockade which temporarily bottled up the heavily outgunned American squadron. After the British commander, Sir James Yeo, raised the blockade on 6 June, an epidemic struck the American fleet causing further delay. Jones sailed with Chauncey's vessels on 31 July and arrived off Niagara on 5 August. As the American ships approached the port, now in British hands, they intercepted enemy brig HMS Charwell and chased her ashore where her crew set her ablaze. Chauncey then sailed to Kingston via York (now Toronto) arriving on 9 August. The next day Jones and the schooner were ordered to cruise between Oswego and Sackett's Harbor protecting American communications. Jones rejoined the fleet on 17 September and operated with it during the remainder of the navigation season attempting to draw Sir James Yeo's ships into a decisive contest. Toward the end of November she returned to Sackett's Harbor, where she served as a receiving ship for several years after the end of the war. She was sold and broken up in 1821.

Snuneymuxw Territory on the eastern coast of Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, and the Fraser River in the British Columbia was in the center of Coast Salish territory. Their language is the Hul‚Äôqumi‚Äônum language. The Snuneymuxw First Nation is responsible for the operation of Newcastle Island Marine Provincial Park.

History There was a Snuneymuxw winter village and burial site dating back about 3,500 years, next to Departure Bay's 7-Eleven store. In 2007 the remains of about 15 individuals were uncovered at the construction site of a future condo development owned by Developer Bruce McLay. Madrone Environmental Services from Duncan, BC conducted an archaeological excavation of the site. In March 2013 as part of the reconciliation agreement, this site was transferred to the Snuneymuxw. Remains of more than 80 people were uncovered. When the late Chief Viola Wyse requested that B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell protect the site the province purchased it. It remained \\"sad, forlorn and neglected\\", surrounded by a bent chain-link fence and covered in straggled patches of weeds. The site of the former Moby Dick Hotel, 1000 Stewart Ave, Nanaimo was the former site of a Snuneymuxw village of historical importance to the Snuneymuxw. It is situated at the narrowest point of Newcastle Channel, separating Newcastle Island from Nanaimo. Former Snuneymuxw Chief White had plans on constructing modest facilities on Newcastle Island to deliver new kinds of programming on Coast Salish culture, Newcastle Island's coal mining history, the CPR history, the canneries history as part of a tourist destination. Snuneymuxw First Nation will be collaborating with Waterfront Holdings Ltd. on current and future waterfront development on Stewart Avenue.  Territory and current land base  Nanaimo town 1 Snuneymuxw Territory on the eastern coast of Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, and the Fraser River in the British Columbia was in the centre of Coast Salish territory. The band's traditional territory covers , but they share of non-exclusive traditional territory with other First Nations of Canada. The Snuneymuxw First Nation received 877 hectares of land, consisting of three parcels of land, in the Mount Benson area, in March 2013 as part of a reconciliation agreement. Ida Chong, B.C. aboriginal relations and reconciliation minister, announced at the Vancouver Island Conference Centre that the land was \\"intended to provide forestry-related economic opportunities to generate revenue and employment\\" for the SFN. The Snuneymuxw previously only had a total reserve land base of 266 hectares with 4 small reserves on the shores of Nanaimo Harbour and Nanaimo River and two tiny reserves at Gabriola Island. Per capita the Snuneymuxw land base is the smallest reserve land base in British Columbia. The community was divided into four separate, numbered reserves near Nanaimo Harbour and Nanaimo River. The small size and odd shapes and locations of these reserves are visible on the interactive map provided by Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada. Reserve 1, consisting of several city blocks, is between a railroad track and the main highway that goes through Nanaimo. Reserve 2 is on the east bank of the Nanaimo River and is cut off from reserves 3 and 4 by the river. The river and river banks are not reserve land. All three are on the estuary and appear to be in a flood zone. These small reserves are bounded by the main Island Highway, Duke Point Highway and Cedar Road. They are surrounded by the city of Nanaimo but have not been fully serviced with water and sewage infrastructure resulting in underdevelopment of the reserve. According to the AANRC Profiles, the Snuneymuxw First Nation, band number 648 had six very small reserves. # Nanaimo town 1, also known as Reserve No. 1, (AANRC number 06815) is located in the Nanaimo District on Nanaimo Harbour adjacent to the city of Nanaimo, south of Vancouver Island and consists of . There were 337 residents in 2011. # Nanaimo River 2, also known as Reserve No. 2, (AANRC number 06816) is located in the Cranberry District on the left bank of the Nanaimo River near its mouth and consists of . There were 26 residents in 2011. It has been dissolved and amalgamated with Nanaimo River. # Nanaimo River 3, also known as Reserve No. 3, (AANRC number 06817) is located in the Cranberry District, point of Section 21, Range 1, and Sections 19 and 21 Range 7, near mouth of Nanaimo River, Vancouver Island and consists of . Statistics Canada provides a precise map. There were 81 residents in 2011. It has been dissolved and amalgamated with Nanaimo River. # Nanaimo River 4, also known as Reserve No. 4, (AANRC number 06818) is located in the Cranberry District, Sections 18 and 19, Range 8, 4 miles southwest of Nanaimo, on the east coast of Vancouver Island and consists of . # Gabriola Island 5 reserve (AANRC number 06819) is located in Nanaimo District, Section 1, on the west point at mouth of Degnen Bay, south of Gabriola Island and consists of . # Ma-guala 6 (AANRC number 06820) is located in Nanaimo District. It is a small island in Degnen Bay on the south shore of Gabriola island and consists of . Nanaimo River Reserve, with 287 residents, is listed on 30 January 2013, as having undergone an amalgamation. Nanaimo River 2 and Nanaimo River 3 were dissolved and amalgamated into Nanaimo River Reserve.  Governance  Snuneymuxw First Nation is governed by a Chief and Council. On 7 December 2013 Chief John Gordon (Gord) Wesley was elected with 253 votes out of 499. Five Councillors were also elected to the Office of Chief and Council for up to a four-year term. Elections are carried out in accordance with the Snuneymuxw First Nation Election Code (2007) & Regulations (2011).  Demographics  The Snuneymuxw First Nation number is 648. The band's population is 1,663, with 65 percent of Snuneymuxw people live off-reserve.  Treaty rights  According to their official website the SFN \\"are one of the few First Nations in BC that has a pre-confederation treaty with the Crown.\\" The Snuneymuxw have treaty rights pursuant to their Treaty of 1854, one of the Douglas Treaties, confirmed by the landmark R. v. White and Bob litigation of the early to mid-1960s, wherein the treaty was confirmed and enforced, and provincial jurisdiction was ousted. In October 2012, Chief Doug White met with UN Special Rapporteur James Anaya. Chief White argued that the Canadian federal government \\"has consistently failed to honour the Treaty of 1854\\" and has repeatedly broken the Treaty of 1854 during land negotiations. Anaya observed that Anaya \\"based on his preliminary findings, treaty and aboriginal claims remain \\"persistently unresolved\\" throughout Canada\\" and there is a heightened level of mistrust distrust \\"among aboriginal peoples toward government at both the federal and provincial levels.\\" In 1992, the Snuneymuxw First Nation filed the Thlap‚Äôqwum Specific Claim related to the loss of their 32 hectare reserve in downtown Nanaimo. The claim was accepted by the Crown as valid in 2003. After negotiations, the two sides agreed to a settlement offer worth $49,148,121. In November 2016, the First Nation ratified a settlement agreement for the land, which was illegally taken by the crown in the 1880s. The nearly $50 million payment is the largest specific claim negotiated by a British Columbia first nation by a factor of 5. As part of the agreement, the nation can negotiate for an additional 32 hectare of land to be added to their reserve.  Social and economic development  = Water and Sewage Infrastructure = In 1992 groundwater contamination was found and the wells were closed on the Snuneymuxw First Nation Indian Reserve No. 2. For twenty years the community was forced to subsist using water trucks. In 2010 the city of Nanaimo announced plans for a new water treatment facility but had difficulty acquiring Crown land needed for the project. John Ruttan, Nanaimo Mayor acknowledged that without the assistance of Snuneymuxw First Nation Chief Doug White III in acquiring some Crown land \\"it‚Äôs questionable whether we would have been able to achieve what we‚Äôve done.\\" The City of Nanaimo agreed to provide the water to Reserve 2 as part of \\"the overall agreement.\\" The Snuneymuxw First Nation are paying $500,000 cost of the project. The new water infrastructure project will connect Reserve No. 2 to Nanaimo‚Äôs water supply lines at 1125 Cedar Road to provide potable water. In November 2012 SFN workers began job shadowing City of Nanaimo CUPE Local 401 water crews members to learn foundational skills in maintaining quality water systems through an innovative mentoring program. CUPE's long-term goal is to expand this pilot project to First Nations communities across Vancouver Island. According to Blaine Gurrie, CUPE Local 401 President and member of the Vancouver Island Water Watch Coalition, CUPE working to assist SFN employees to,  Justice system  In 2006 226 First Nations members were imprisoned in the Nanaimo Correctional Centre (NCC), a provincial prison on SFN traditional territory. That represented 21.2% of the prison population. In British Columbia the percentage of indigenous prisoners was 20% in 2004-5.

In this theory, a spacetime is characterized by a curvature- free linear connection in conjunction with a metric tensor field, both defined in terms of a dynamical tetrad field. Teleparallel spacetimes The crucial new idea, for Einstein, was the introduction of a tetrad field, i.e., a set of four vector fields defined on all of such that for every the set is a basis of , where denotes the fiber over of the tangent vector bundle . Hence, the four- dimensional spacetime manifold must be a parallelizable manifold. The tetrad field was introduced to allow the distant comparison of the direction of tangent vectors at different points of the manifold, hence the name distant parallelism. His attempt failed because there was no Schwarzschild solution in his simplified field equation. In fact, one can define the connection of the parallelization (also called the Weitzenb√∂ck connection) to be the linear connection on such that : abla_v\\\\left(f^i\\\\mathrm X_i\\\\right)=\\\\left(vf^i\\\\right)\\\\mathrm X_i(p), where and are (global) functions on ; thus is a global vector field on . In other words, the coefficients of Weitzenb√∂ck connection with respect to are all identically zero, implicitly defined by: : abla_{\\\\mathrm{X}_i} \\\\mathrm{X}_j = 0, hence :{W^k}_{ij} = \\\\omega^k\\\\left( abla_{\\\\mathrm{X}_i} \\\\mathrm{X}_j\\\\right)\\\\equiv 0, for the connection coefficients (also called Weitzenb√∂ck coefficients) in this global basis. Here is the dual global basis (or coframe) defined by . This is what usually happens in , in any affine space or Lie group (for example the 'curved' sphere but 'Weitzenb√∂ck flat' manifold). Using the transformation law of a connection, or equivalently the properties, we have the following result. > Proposition. In a natural basis, associated with local coordinates , i.e., > in the holonomic frame , the (local) connection coefficients of the > Weitzenb√∂ck connection are given by: :{\\\\Gamma^{\\\\beta}}_{\\\\mu u}= > h^{\\\\beta}_{i} \\\\partial_{ u} h^{i}_{\\\\mu}, where for are the local > expressions of a global object, that is, the given tetrad. The Weitzenb√∂ck connection has vanishing curvature, but ‚Äì in general ‚Äì non- vanishing torsion. Given the frame field , one can also define a metric by conceiving of the frame field as an orthonormal vector field. One would then obtain a pseudo-Riemannian metric tensor field of signature (3,1) by :g\\\\left(\\\\mathrm{X}_i,\\\\mathrm{X}_j\\\\right)=\\\\eta_{ij}, where :\\\\eta_{ij}=\\\\operatorname{diag}(-1,-1,-1,1). The corresponding underlying spacetime is called, in this case, a Weitzenb√∂ck spacetime.\\"On the History of Unified Field Theories\\". It is worth noting to see that these 'parallel vector fields' give rise to the metric tensor as a byproduct. New teleparallel gravity theory New teleparallel gravity theory (or new general relativity) is a theory of gravitation on Weitzenb√∂ck spacetime, and attributes gravitation to the torsion tensor formed of the parallel vector fields. In the new teleparallel gravity theory the fundamental assumptions are as follows: In 1961 Christian M√∏ller revived Einstein's idea, and Pellegrini and Plebanski found a Lagrangian formulation for absolute parallelism. = M√∏ller tetrad theory of gravitation = In 1961, M√∏ller showed that a tetrad description of gravitational fields allows a more rational treatment of the energy-momentum complex than in a theory based on the metric tensor alone. The advantage of using tetrads as gravitational variables was connected with the fact that this allowed to construct expressions for the energy-momentum complex which had more satisfactory transformation properties than in a purely metric formulation. Recently it has been shown that total energy of matter and gravitation is proportional to the Ricci scalar of three-space up to linear order of perturbation. New translation teleparallel gauge theory of gravity Independently in 1967, Hayashi and Nakano revived Einstein's idea, and Pellegrini and Plebanski started to formulate the gauge theory of the space-time translation group. Hayashi pointed out the connection between the gauge theory of the spacetime translation group and absolute parallelism. The first fiber bundle formulation was provided by Cho. This model was later studied by Schweizer et al., Nitsch and Hehl, Meyer, and more recent advances can be found in Aldrovandi and Pereira, Gronwald, Itin, Maluf and da Rocha Neto, M√ºnch, Obukhov and Pereira, and Schucking and Surowitz. Nowadays, people study teleparallelism purely as a theory of gravity without trying to unify it with electromagnetism. In this theory, the gravitational field turns out to be fully represented by the translational gauge potential , as it should be for a gauge theory for the translation group. If this choice is made, then there is no longer any Lorentz gauge symmetry because the internal Minkowski space fiber‚Äîover each point of the spacetime manifold‚Äîbelongs to a fiber bundle with the Abelian as structure group. However, a translational gauge symmetry may be introduced thus: Instead of seeing tetrads as fundamental, we introduce a fundamental translational gauge symmetry instead (which acts upon the internal Minkowski space fibers affinely so that this fiber is once again made local) with a connection and a \\"coordinate field\\" taking on values in the Minkowski space fiber. More precisely, let be the Minkowski fiber bundle over the spacetime manifold . For each point , the fiber is an affine space. In a fiber chart , coordinates are usually denoted by , where are coordinates on spacetime manifold , and are coordinates in the fiber . Using the abstract index notation, let refer to and refer to the tangent bundle . In any particular gauge, the value of at the point p is given by the section :x^\\\\mu \\\\to \\\\left(x^\\\\mu,x^a = \\\\xi^a(p)\\\\right). The covariant derivative :D_\\\\mu \\\\xi^a \\\\equiv \\\\left(d \\\\xi^a\\\\right)_\\\\mu + {B^a}_\\\\mu = \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\xi^a + {B^a}_\\\\mu is defined with respect to the connection form , a 1-form assuming values in the Lie algebra of the translational abelian group . Here, d is the exterior derivative of the th component of , which is a scalar field (so this isn't a pure abstract index notation). Under a gauge transformation by the translation field , :x^a\\\\to x^a+\\\\alpha^a and :{B^a}_\\\\mu\\\\to {B^a}_\\\\mu - \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\alpha^a and so, the covariant derivative of is gauge invariant. This is identified with the translational (co-)tetrad :{h^a}_\\\\mu = \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\xi^a + {B^a}_\\\\mu which is a one-form which takes on values in the Lie algebra of the translational Abelian group , whence it is gauge invariant. But what does this mean? is a local section of the (pure translational) affine internal bundle , another important structure in addition to the translational gauge field . Geometrically, this field determines the origin of the affine spaces; it is known as Cartan‚Äôs radius vector. In the gauge-theoretic framework, the one-form :h^a = {h^a}_\\\\mu dx^\\\\mu = \\\\left(\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\xi^a + {B^a}_\\\\mu\\\\right)dx^{\\\\mu} arises as the nonlinear translational gauge field with interpreted as the Goldstone field describing the spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry. A crude analogy: Think of as the computer screen and the internal displacement as the position of the mouse pointer. Think of a curved mousepad as spacetime and the position of the mouse as the position. Keeping the orientation of the mouse fixed, if we move the mouse about the curved mousepad, the position of the mouse pointer (internal displacement) also changes and this change is path dependent; i.e., it doesn't only depend upon the initial and final position of the mouse. The change in the internal displacement as we move the mouse about a closed path on the mousepad is the torsion. Another crude analogy: Think of a crystal with line defects (edge dislocations and screw dislocations but not disclinations). The parallel transport of a point of along a path is given by counting the number of (up/down, forward/backwards and left/right) crystal bonds transversed. The Burgers vector corresponds to the torsion. Disinclinations correspond to curvature, which is why they are left out. The torsion, i.e., the translational field strength of Teleparallel Gravity (or the translational \\"curvature\\"), :{T^a}_{\\\\mu u} \\\\equiv \\\\left(DB^a\\\\right)_{\\\\mu u} = D_\\\\mu {B^a}_ u - D_ u {B^a}_\\\\mu, is gauge invariant. Of course, we can always choose the gauge where is zero everywhere (a problem though; is an affine space and also a fiber and so, we have to define the origin on a point by point basis, but this can always be done arbitrarily) and this leads us back to the theory where the tetrad is fundamental. Teleparallelism refers to any theory of gravitation based upon this framework. There is a particular choice of the action which makes it exactly equivalent to general relativity, but there are also other choices of the action which are not equivalent to GR. In some of these theories, there is no equivalence between inertial and gravitational masses. Unlike GR, gravity is not due to the curvature of spacetime. It is due to the torsion. Non-gravitational contexts There exists a close analogy of geometry of spacetime with the structure of defects in crystal. Dislocations are represented by torsion, disclinations by curvature. These defects are not independent of each other. A dislocation is equivalent to a disclination-antidisclination pair, a disclination is equivalent to a string of dislocations. This is the basic reason why Einstein's theory based purely on curvature can be rewritten as a teleparallel theory based only on torsion. There exists, moreover, infinitely many ways of rewriting Einstein's theory, depending on how much of the curvature one wants to reexpress in terms of torsion, the teleparallel theory being merely one specific version of these. A further application of teleparallelism occurs in quantum field theory, namely, two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with target space on simple geometric manifolds, whose renormalization behavior is controlled by a Ricci flow, which includes torsion. This torsion modifies the Ricci tensor and hence leads to an infrared fixed point for the coupling, on account of teleparallelism (\\"geometrostasis\\").

Home & Personal Computers. It offered a fast loader, increasing the speeds of the disk drive, and a freezer, allowing the program execution to be stopped to be resumed later.  Features  The cartridge featured a \\"reset\\" button and a \\"freeze\\" button, as well as a LED that indicated whether or not the module was active. The cartridge featured a \\"Final Kill\\" option (accessible through the desktop, freezer or BASIC) which disabled the cartridge's functionality and booted the computer to unexpanded state. This was needed as some software, particularly games, were incompatible with fast- loaders; disabling the cartridge meant it never needed to be removed. One of the unique features of the cartridge was its GUI, even when its usefulness remained quite limited compared to other GUI environments for Commodore 64. Unless RUN/STOP key was held down during power-on or reset, the cartridge presented a graphical WIMP desktop. The graphical look of the desktop was borrowed from AmigaOS 1.x. It was possible to load new GUI-based utilities from disk or tape, though these remained rare. Of the tools in the cartridge ROM, the most useful were a text editor, a disk file management utility, a calculator, and an alarm clock. A big selling point was the disk and tape turbo feature, which was available for most commands; this accelerated loading things from disk or tape considerably. However, the biggest strength of this particular cartridge for the Commodore 64 lies in the built-in machine code monitor program, which is capable of the widest range of features, such as text and sprite dump, as well as text and sprite editing. The cartridge provided an extension to the Commodore BASIC, which contained several new BASIC programming aids, such as \`RENUMBER\`, and several utility commands, one of the most notable of which was \`DOS\\"\` which can be used to give Commodore DOS commands (e.g. \`DOS\\"S0:UNDESIRED FILE\` to delete a file), read the error status of the drive (plain \`DOS\\"\`) or display the disk directory without overwriting the BASIC program in the memory (\`DOS\\"$\`). The BASIC commands also allowed to return to the GUI desktop mode, or start the machine-language monitor. The freezer feature allowed to save the memory contents to disk to be resumed at later point (this allowed for convenient copying of single-load games, for example). It also allowed the use of some rudimentary game cheating functionality (disabling sprite collision detection, for example), and printing a copy of the screen image to the printer. The freezer also allowed access to the machine-language monitor. The FC3 can be combined very well with a SD2IEC-Floppy, because his Fastloader stays alive in File-Browsers like CBM or SD2BRWSE. Also, user have the very good FC3 F-key commands for changing directories on the SD-Card or loading files without the need of typing anything. Therefore, the combination FC3 and SD2IEC complement each other very well.

The EIT instrument is sensitive to light of four different wavelengths: 17.1, 19.5, 28.4, and 30.4 nm, corresponding to light produced by highly ionized iron (XI)/(X), (XII), (XV), and helium (II), respectively. EIT is built as a single telescope with a quadrant structure to the entrance mirrors: each quadrant reflects a different colour of EUV light, and the wavelength to be observed is selected by a shutter that blocks light from all but the desired quadrant of the main telescope. The EIT wavelengths are of great interest to solar physicists because they are emitted by the very hot solar corona but not by the relatively cooler photosphere of the Sun; this reveals structures in the corona that would otherwise be obscured by the brightness of the Sun itself. EIT was originally conceived as a viewfinder instrument to help select observing targets for the other instruments on board SOHO, but EIT is credited with a good fraction of the original science to come from SOHO, including the first observations of traveling wave phenomena in the corona, characterization of coronal mass ejection onset, and determination of the structure of coronal holes. Before mid-2010, EIT obtained an Fe XII (19.5 nm wavelength) image of the Sun about four times an hour, around the clock; these were immediately uplinked as time-lapse movies to the SOHO web site for immediate viewing by anyone who is interested. (Since the summer of 2010, when Thorpe commissioning of the Solar Dynamics Observatory was completed, its Atmospheric Imaging Assembly has been able to take much higher resolution solar images much more frequently. The white-light coronagraphs on SOHO are thus able to take images more frequently: they share a CPU and telemetry bandwidth with EIT. The images are used for long-duration studies of the Sun, for detailed structural analyses of solar features, and for real-time space weather prediction by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center. Technology EIT is the first long-duration instrument to use normal incidence multilayer coated optics to image the Sun in extreme ultraviolet. This portion of the spectrum is extremely difficult to reflect, as most matter absorbs the light very strongly. Conventionally these wavelengths have been reflected either using grazing incidence (as in a Wolter telescope for imaging X-rays) or a diffraction grating (as in the jocularly-termed overlappograph flown on Skylab in the mid 1970s). Modern vacuum deposition technology allows mirrors to be coated with extremely thin layers of nearly any material. The multilayer mirrors in an EUV telescope are coated with alternate layers of a light \\"spacer\\" element (such as silicon) that absorbs EUV light only weakly, and a heavy \\"scatterer\\" element (such as molybdenum) that absorbs EUV light very strongly. Perhaps 100 layers of each type might be placed on the mirror, with a thickness of around 10 nm each. The layer thickness is tightly controlled, so that at the desired wavelength, reflected photons from each layer interfere constructively. In this way, reflectivities of up to ~50% can be attained. The multilayer technology allows conventional telescope forms (such as the Cassegrain or Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien designs) to be used in a novel part of the spectrum. Solar imaging with multilayer EUV optics was pioneered in the 1990s by the MSSTA and NIXT sounding rockets, each of which flew on several five- minute missions into space. Multilayer EUV optics are also used in terrestrial nanolithography rigs for fabrication of microchips. The EIT detector is a conventional CCDs that are back-illuminated and specially thinned to admit the EUV photons. Because the detector is about equally sensitive to EUV and visible photons, and the Sun is about one billion (109) times brighter in visible light than in EUV, special thin foil filters are used to block the visible light while admitting the EUV. The filters are made of extremely thin aluminum foil, about 200 nm (0.2 micrometre) thick, and transmit about half of the incident EUV light while absorbing essentially all of the incident visible light. History EIT was a difficult sell to the scientific funding agencies, as it was not clear in the early 1990s that simple imaging of the corona would be scientifically useful (most of the other instruments on board SOHO are spectrographs of various kinds). The EIT PI, Jean-Pierre Delaboudiniere, was forced to scrounge funding and resources from several locations to construct and launch the instrument. For example, EIT alone of the SOHO instruments does not have its own flight computer; it is connected to the LASCO instrument flight computer, and is treated operationally as an additional LASCO camera. No funding was available for a pointing adjustment mechanisms, so EIT is bolted directly to the spacecraft and hence forms the SOHO pointing reference: the other instruments all align themselves to the EIT images. Focus adjustment is achieved by thermal expansion: the internal survival heaters (found in most spaceborne instruments) are used to achieve microscopic changes in the size of the telescope structure and hence the mirror spacing. EIT was originally allocated only about 1 kbit/s of data‚Äîabout the same speed as a 110 baud teletype‚Äîbut after its utility became clear much more telemetry bandwidth was allocated to it. Related instruments The technology in EIT is based on prototype instruments that were flown on the sounding rocket payloads MSSTA and NIXT. The first multilayer telescope to image the full disk of the Sun in EUV was flown by A.B.C. Walker and team in 1987. The TRACE, STEREO, and Proba-2 spacecraft (launched in 1998, 2006, and 2009, respectively) carry similar multilayer imagers, as does the Solar Dynamics Observatory mission.

Typically, a puukko's blade is ground with the so-called Scandi Grind (flat grind) where the primary grind is also the edge bevel without any secondary edges.  Design  The basic components of a puukko are a handle and a blade along with a sheath, which can usually be attached to a belt but sometimes to a shirt or coat button. The blade is usually short, typically no longer than the handle and can often be less than 4\\" (100 mm).'Puukko - the Finnish Sheath Knife \\" The flat grind makes the puukko a natural choice for slicing, cutting and whittling, and the flat spine allows the user to use a thumb or the other hand to bring more force to bear to the task at hand. Puukkos are most often used as carving tools for decorative and fire-making purposes and to clean fishers' and hunters' catches. Some puukko designs have a slightly upwards or downwards curved point, depending on what purpose the knife has. A hunting puukko's tip is often curved downwards to make skinning and opening the animal easier and less messy. Fishermen's puukkos sometimes have a small dovetail on point to ease scraping off the innards of a fish. Most puukkos have a slight shoulder but no ricasso (section of unsharpened blade nearest the handle) because the point where the edge ends and the handle begins is also the point where most power can be applied. A puukko typically has no finger guard, since it is primarily considered a cutting tool, not a stabbing weapon. In cases where the knife and the hand are expected to get wet, like if the puukko is meant for gutting fish or game, some form of guard is carved into the handle. The traditional length of the puukko blade is the same as one's palm width, usually 90‚Äì120 mm. Carvers, huntsmen and leatherworkers favour shorter blades; woodworkers, carpenters and constructors longer. The blade of the historical v√§kipuukko may be up to 500 mm. The v√§kipuukko more closely resembles a seax or short sword than true puukko, although it has given the form for the leuku of the s√°mi people. Both factory-forged and hand-forged blades are sometimes laminated: a thin layer of very hard steel (traditionally crucible steel made from limonite iron) is sandwiched between two layers of softer metal, which make the blade less brittle and facilitates repeated sharpening. Before the 19th century, almost all iron in Finland was made from limonite on charcoal blast furnaces, which yield very pure and high-quality iron suitable for crucible steel. German silver steel was and is a popular core-steel material. Today both carbon steel and stainless are used. The blade can be lightened and strengthened with a fuller. The traditional material for the handle is curly (masur) birch. Also great sallow root, birch bark, antler (especially elk and reindeer), scrimshaw and bone are used. Often the handle is made from various materials between spacers. Today, however, industrially made puukkos often have plastic handles. In Finland and northern Scandinavia, many men put great pride in carving their puukko's handle. Over generations, this knife has become intimately tied to Nordic culture and, in one or another version, is part of many national costumes. A good puukko is equal parts artistic expression and tool. Making it requires a lot of different skills: not only those of a bladesmith, but also those of a carver, a jeweller, a designer, and a leatherworker to make the sheath. Some fine puukkos have blades of pattern welded steel, and forging a blade using crucible steel was considered the hallmark of a master smith.  Usage  Modern \\"Sissipuukko\\" (Ranger / Commando Puukko) a puukko type field knife for military use Men's and women's puukkos do not significantly differ other than in size, as the handle of a puukko should match the hand of its owner. Women's puukkos are often shorter, with more decorated sheaths, and more oriented for working with foodstuffs. Both boy and girl Scouts consider the puukko their scouting symbol as well as a handy tool. In the Nordic countries, the puukko is an \\"everyday knife\\" used for everything from hunting, fishing, and gardening to opening boxes in a warehouse. Many traditional puukkos are nowadays manufactured in industrial or near-industrial scale by many companies, Marttiini and Iisakki J√§rvenp√§√§ Oy being the most notable. Bearing of sharp objects which could be used as weapons was banned in Finland in 1977. Since then, the puukko has lost its visibility in public places and been restricted to household work, hunting and fishing. In many industries the Mora knife which has a much cheaper construction is in use. The mora knife's handle is typically plastic, and the blade is either stainless steel or of laminated construction; harder steel which forms the edge is clad in softer steel. In Finnish, these knives also are usually referred to as puukko. In Finland, carrying a knife in public without an acceptable (usually job-related) reason is prohibited and the only urban areas where open carry is an everyday sight are military garrisons. Although open carry is illegal, this is not vigorously enforced. Construction workers often go to diners with a puukko hanging from their overalls and in the rural and Northern parts of the country it is not uncommon to go shopping in village stores in hunting clothes, including a puukko. For instance, the deep ecologist, ornithologist and writer Pentti Linkola, who supported himself as a fisherman, often appeared in public wearing his puukko.\\"Sivistyneist√∂n arvomaailma h√§visi rojuun ja rihkamaan\\", Syd√§n-H√§meen Lehti, August 29., 2012 , A puukko was traditionally the only civilian item that could be openly carried as a part of a soldier's combat gear without breaching the Finnish Defence Forces regulations. A good puukko was considered an essential outdoorsman's tool, and thus vital for a soldier in the field. Puukkos proved to be good close combat weapons in the Winter War and Continuation War. Paradoxically, the Defence Forces do not have knives on general issue, due mainly to the puukko having been a highly personal item ‚Äî and even today most conscripts follow the age-old tradition of bringing their own into service. It is a custom of Finnish conscripts, especially non-commissioned officers, and officer cadets to carry a decorated and/or engraved commemorative puukko of their military school or training course as a part of their uniform, not unlike a commemorative dagger. The bayonet of the Rk-62 assault rifle was designed to also function as a puukko, as was the rare bayonet for the M/39 Mosin-Nagant. In Finland, receiving a puukko as a gift is considered an honour, the idea being that the presenter is giving the recipient a tool which is essential for both woodworking and preparing food and as a weapon and that the presenter takes into account the well-being of the recipient. Tapio Wirkkala, famous Finnish designer, designed a Puukko for Gutmann cutlery. The puukko has also given the root for Finnish language verb puukottaa, \\"to stab (with a knife)\\" or literally \\"to knife\\".

Ritter is known for his distinctive Americana style and narrative lyrics. In 2006, he was named one of the \\"100 Greatest Living Songwriters\\" by Paste magazine.  Early life  Ritter was born and raised in Moscow, Idaho. As a teenager, after hearing Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan's \\"Girl from the North Country\\" on his parents' copy of Nashville Skyline, he attempted to write songs on a lute that his father had built, before abandoning the lute and buying his first guitar at K-Mart. Ritter graduated from Moscow High School in 1995 and attended Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio to study neuroscience, but later changed his major to the self-created \\"American History Through Narrative Folk Music\\". At the age of 21, Ritter recorded his first album, Josh Ritter, at a recording studio on campus. After graduating Ritter moved to Scotland to attend the School of Scottish Studies for six months. He then moved back to Idaho for a few months before moving to Providence, Rhode Island, then Somerville, Massachusetts, where he worked temporary jobs and played at open mic nights. During this time, Ritter sold copies of his album and was spotted by Irish musician Glen Hansard and his band, The Frames, who invited him to return with them to Ireland. Ritter found on the trip to Ireland that his album sold particularly well at open mics there. With the money from merchandise sales, Ritter was eventually able to quit his day job and devote himself to music full-time. Josh Ritter at the Music Farm in Charleston, SC on 07-26-2011 Career A year and a half after recording Josh Ritter, Ritter recorded his second album, Golden Age of Radio, for $1000 and self-released it. The album was recorded in three different studios: Soundgun in Philadelphia, Electric Cave in New Hampshire, and a friend's basement studio. While promoting Golden Age of Radio, he met Jim Olsen, head of independent record label Signature Sounds, who offered to remaster and re-release the album after hearing Ritter play. The song \\"Me & Jiggs\\" was subsequently released as a single in Ireland, where Ritter was quickly becoming a word-of-mouth success, first opening for the Frames, then headlining his own shows. Ritter's third record, Hello Starling, produced by former Frames guitarist Dave Odlum, debuted at No. 2 on the Irish charts. Ritter, left, in concert with longtime bassist Zack Hickman In 2003, Ritter shared top billing with the French Kicks at Sepomana, the annual music festival produced by WRMC 91.1 FM. Ritter and Ron Sexsmith headlined the Friday night singer-songwriter event at the Hotel Viking at the 2004 Newport Folk Festival. He also appeared at Oxegen 2005, and has headlined with artists such as Joan Baez, who later released her own version of Ritter's song \\"Wings\\" on her album Dark Chords on a Big Guitar. He was signed by a British label, V2 Records, in 2005 and Hello Starling was subsequently re- released. He began performing and touring in a crossover duo with the classical violinist Hilary Hahn in 2005. In 2006 Ritter released his fourth album The Animal Years. 2006 also saw the release of Ritter's first full- length live album and DVD In the Dark ‚Äì Live at Vicar Street which was recorded over two nights in May 2006. Ritter released his fifth album, The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter, in 2007. Both The Animal Years and Historical Conquests received a warm critical reception with Stephen King calling The Animal Years the best album of 2006 in his column for Entertainment Weekly. In support of Historical Conquests, Ritter appeared as a musical guest on such high-profile television shows as Late Show with David Letterman in America and Later... with Jools Holland in Britain. Ritter re- issued his second and third albums, Golden Age of Radio and Hello Starling, on April 7, 2009 and January 17, 2010, respectively. Each re-issued album was packaged as a two-disc deluxe edition. The deluxe editions contain both the original studio album as well as solo acoustic versions of all the original tracks, live and remixed bonus songs, and never-before-seen photos and artwork. The deluxe editions also feature liner notes written by Ritter fans, including Dennis Lehane and Cameron Crowe. In Autumn 2009 Ritter toured with Love Canon String Band, where he reinterpreted his songs with a band composed of banjo, double bass, mandolin and guitar. This tour included three nights in Whelans Dublin, where he performed his albums Golden Age of Radio, Hello Starling, and The Animal Years in full. In 2009, Ritter also provided the soundtrack for the documentary film Typeface, by Kartemquin Films. Ritter's sixth album, So Runs the World Away, was released April 23, 2010 in Ireland and May 4, 2010 worldwide. The vinyl version of the album had an earlier release on April 17, 2010 as a part of Record Store Day celebrations. The vinyl record came packaged with a CD version of the album as well. To promote the album before its release, Ritter made one of the songs, \\"Change of Time\\", freely available online. The song also appeared in the March 23, 2010 episode of the television series Parenthood and the trailer for the 2011 Natalie Portman film The Other Woman. In support of the new album Ritter toured with his newly named Royal City Band ‚Äì starting with six dates in Ireland ‚Äì including a sellout performance at the newly opened, 2100-capacity Grand Canal Theatre in Dublin, and continuing with an extensive tour of the United States. So Runs the World Away largely garnered positive reviews. Ritter performing at the Cathedral of the Rockies in 2015. On February 15, 2011, Ritter reissued The Animal Years on vinyl and as a two-disc deluxe edition on CD. The deluxe edition contains both the original studio album as well as a solo acoustic version of the album. The bonus disc includes four b-side recordings, two videos, new artwork, and liner notes by author Tom Ricks. During his early 2011 tour, Josh Ritter released an EP album of previously unreleased material from the So Runs the World Away recording sessions, titled To the Yet Unknowing World. Ritter began streaming the EP for free on his website as well as made it available for digital purchase on February 8, 2011. To the Yet Unknowing World hit Apple's iTunes and record stores February 15, 2011. In February 2011, Ritter and his band continued their extensive tour in support of So Runs The World Away, touring America and Europe. During his European tour in April 2011 Ritter released his third live album, Live at The Iveagh Gardens. The limited edition two CD and one DVD set is a live recording of Ritter's performance of 21 songs at the Dublin venue on July 18, 2010. Ritter‚Äôs seventh studio album, The Beast In Its Tracks, was released on March 5, 2013. The album was preceded by singles \\"Joy To You Baby\\" and \\"Hopeful.\\" On July 27, 2015, Ritter announced his eighth studio album, Sermon on the Rocks. The first single \\"Getting Ready To Get Down\\" was premiered the same day. Ritter commented that the inspiration behind the album came from his desire to \\"play messianic oracular honky-tonk.\\" Sermon on the Rocks was released later that year on October 16, 2015. In 2017, the album‚Äôs second single, \\"Homecoming\\", received notable attention after being featured in the season 2 finale of Showtime‚Äôs Billions. Ritter‚Äôs ninth studio album, Gathering, was announced on July 19, 2017. The first single, \\"Showboat,\\" was released the same day as the album announcement. \\"[Gathering] is a record of joy and sadness and laughter and lightning,\\" commented Ritter. Along with the announcement of Gathering, Ritter also revealed he was going on an international tour with the Royal City Band. \\"Thunderbolt‚Äôs Goodnight\\" and \\"When Will I Be Changed\\" premiered before Gathering was officially released on September 22, 2017. Other ventures Ritter also has an interest in writing, and has claimed many different writers as influences on both his songwriting and fiction work. Some of his favorite authors are Flannery O'Connor, Philip Roth, and Dennis Lehane (who wrote the intro for the Deluxe Edition of Hello Starling). The title of Ritter's sixth album, So Runs the World Away, comes from a line in the third act of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Ritter's own novel, Bright's Passage, was published by Dial Press on June 28, 2011. He said of the novel, \\"Besides my songs, Bright's Passage is the first [written] work I've wanted anyone to see ... it's about a kind of sweet normal guy from West Virginia. He goes to the first World War and he comes back and he has an angel. And it's about him and this angel escaping this wildfire for five days. It's sort of this short little comedy.\\"  Personal life  Ritter married fellow musician Dawn Landes in Branson, Missouri, on May 9, 2009. In a February 2011 interview with the Boston Herald, Ritter revealed that they had separated. Ritter and his current partner, author Haley Tanner, own a home together in Woodstock, New York. They had their first child, a daughter named Beatrix Wendylove Ritter, on November 11, 2012. On November 22, 2009 Ritter played at a benefit concert at Moscow High School, his former high school in his hometown of Moscow, Idaho. The concert was for Jim LaFortune, one of Ritter's former teachers, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor. In May 2018 Ritter revealed that he and his wife had adopted a child in January of that year. Their newest daughter Moxie was matched with them through Wide Horizons For Children, an adoption organization Ritter has advocated for. Part of his Gathering tour was cancelled to accommodate for this new addition to his family, though Ritter has promised to return to those markets for another show. The Royal City Band In 2010, Ritter's band members ‚Äì some of whom had been performing with him from the early 2000s ‚Äì were given the name \\"The Royal City Band\\" (a reference to the song \\"Thin Blue Flame\\" from The Animal Years).

It is the second video game in the Mega Man Zero subseries of Mega Man video games. The game is set one year following the events of Mega Man Zero, and follows the same basic format as its predecessor, being a side-scrolling, platform action game. Once again, players take control of the Reploid known as Zero, and lead him through various levels in the battle against the forces of Neo Arcadia. The European version also released the same day as the North American Mega Man X7 was. It was released in Japan on the Wii U's Virtual Console on January 7, 2015. In February 2020, the game was released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam as part of the Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection. Plot One year has passed since Zero defeated Copy X. He has since separated from Ciel and the Resistance, now wandering the desert and defeating countless Pantheons. The three surviving members of the Four Guardians have assumed command of Neo Arcadia, with Harpuia as the leader. Copy X's death was covered up, as the humans revered him as their savior. The Resistance is now being led by a Reploid named Elpizo, while Ciel continues her work on a new form of energy that will hopefully eliminate the need for war. Zero wearily makes his way through a sandstorm wrapped in a tattered cloak. As the sands die down he is once more being chased by enemies. Despite being in disrepair, with cracked armor and broken weapons, he charges into the fray. After the battle, Zero collapses from exhaustion and is found by Harpuia. Wishing to see Zero die in battle rather than perish from exhaustion, Harpuia rescues Zero and covertly delivers him to a location near the Resistance base, where he is found and repaired. He learns that Elpizo is planning a frontal assault on Neo Arcadia, as he doesn't believe in Ciel's plan of creating energy as means to resolve the war. Unable to convince him to call it off, Zero is left to do busy-work in the meantime. Elpizo's assault fails miserably, himself being the only survivor. Driven mad, he declares his desire to harness the power of the legendary Dark Elf to destroy Neo Arcadia (and wipe out the humans), which had brought about the Elf Wars a century ago that left the Earth in a disastrous state. Using the powers granted by partially unsealing the Dark Elf, he invades Neo Arcadia and breaks into the temple where the body of the real X is kept. It is revealed that X ended the Elf Wars by sealing the Dark Elf away with his body, thus leading to his disappearance. Despite the Guardians' and Zero's best efforts, Elpizo destroys X's body, which unseals the Dark Elf, and Elpizo absorbs its powers. After a fierce battle, Zero puts an end to Elpizo's plans, who reverts to his normal self and apologizes as he dies. Surprisingly, the Dark Elf turns him into a Cyber-elf, convincing Elpizo that she is not truly evil. As the Dark Elf departs, X appears and tells Zero about the Dark Elf: she was originally known as the Mother Elf and was the savior who ended the Maverick Wars, but was later cursed by a man named Dr. Weil. Zero admits to feeling like he knows her. In a post credits scene, an unknown man notes the Dark Elf has been released, and tells an entity known as \\"Omega\\" that it is time to take action. Gameplay The controls are identical to that in the previous game, with players given the option to assign functions to the buttons they are most comfortable using. The weapons are also identical, with the exception of the Triple Rod, which has been replaced by the similar but somewhat more complex Chain Rod. Cyber Elves are present in the game, and function in the same manner as they did in the previous game. However, unlike the first game, in which four specific Cyber Elves could be transformed into health-storing Sub-Tanks, two of the four Sub-Tanks are now hidden in various stages as collectible items, as they were in the previous series, while the remaining two must be unlocked using Cyber Elves. While the first game in the series had the player select missions from a list, Mega Man Zero 2 returns to the traditional Stage Select option found in the Mega Man and Mega Man X games, although the player can only select from four at a time. In addition, whereas Mega Man Zero had a large, interconnected world, none of the stages in this game are linked. New features added to the game are Forms and EX Skills. Forms are unlocked by completing various tasks during a mission, such as destroying a set number of enemies with the Buster Shot. Forms alter Zero's abilities in various ways, such as increasing the power of certain weapons or making him more resilient. However, they also tend to decrease performance in other areas, such as lowering attack power for increased defense or removing special attacks of the Z-Saber to enhance the Buster Shot. EX Skills are unlocked if a player completes a mission with an A or S rank, allowing the player to give Zero's weapons the properties of the bosses he's defeated. Players begin the game with the Buster Shot and the Z-Saber. After the introductory mission, Zero is granted the Shield Boomerang and the Chain Rod, which replaces the Triple Rod in the previous game. As with the previous game, the player can unlock new attacks and abilities for the weapons through repeated use. There are fewer upgrades in this game; the Z-Saber has a total of four upgrades, while the rest only have two. Cyber Elves function in the same manner as the previous game, being single-use aids with either temporary or permanent effects on Zero or the game's levels. They are hidden throughout the game as well as dropped by enemies. The use of Cyber Elves penalizes the mission score. There are three types of Cyber Elves, \\"Nurse\\", \\"Animal and Hacker. While certain Elves can be used immediately, the larger Elves need to be fed crystals in order to be used. The cost for doing so is significantly less than it was in the previous game. This game introduces the concept of Forms, which can be earned by meeting certain criteria throughout the game, ranging from killing twenty enemies in a stage with a dashing slash technique to getting twenty-five energy capsules in one stage. Another new addition to the series is EX Skills, which are similar to Mega Man's ability to copy powers from the bosses in previous series. Unlike the previous series, however, Zero has to have an A or S rank going into the stage to unlock the bosses EX Skill. Unlike Mega Man's copy ability, which required weapon energy to feed the attacks, EX Skills modify Zero's weapons, adding new abilities or replacing their normal abilities with an ability similar to the defeated boss. For example, the Buster Shot can be modified to fire a long-piercing beam instead of its normal charged blast, while the Z-Saber gains additional moves such as a powerful rising slash. As with the first game, a \\"New Game Plus\\" can be played by beating the game and loading the completed save file. In the new game, Zero will start with all activated Cyber Elves used from the previous game still in effect (the penalties, however, will still remain). Zero will also get to keep any EX Skills and alternate forms that he earned in the previous game. Additional modes can also be unlocked under proper conditions. Hard Mode is unlocked by beating the game once. To play, hold L when selecting to start a New Game. In Hard Mode, Zero starts with the \\"Proto Form\\", which doubles his attack strength but halves his defense and locks his weapons at their basic level. Zero also cannot earn any EX skills or alternate forms. Beating Hard Mode will unlock a special \\"Image Gallery\\" option. Hold L and Select when selecting New Game to enter it. Unlike the other games in the series, there is no Ultimate Mode to be unlocked. However, an \\"Ultimate Form\\" can be unlocked by leveling up and using every Cyber Elf in the game. It increases all of Zero's stats and also allows him to use full-charge attacks instantly by means of simplistic button combos. =Multiplayer= If you have two cartridges and a link cable, the players can link two GBAs and take part in a two-player game. There are three modes available to take part in:Mega Man Zero 2 Instruction Manual *Time Attack - Set a goal somewhere in the stage. After three tries, the player with the shortest time to the goal wins. *Enemy Battle - Defeat the most enemies from the generator within the time limit. *Get Item - Collect the most items from the map within the time limit. Reception Mega Man Zero 2 was the seventh best-selling video game in Japan during its week of release at 53,839 copies and climbed to the number one spot the following week with an additional 25,283 copies sold. The game appeared on Famitsu magazine's top 30 best-sellers list for the following four weeks. By the end of 2003, Mega Man Zero 2 had sold 158,479 copies in Japan alone. A common remark is that the game has not changed much in its formula since its predecessor, though they do acknowledge that improvements have been made to the stage select menus. A general complaint is the difficulty of the game, with one reviewer expressing concern that the difficulty would put some people off the game.

The Polyus spacecraft (, pole), also known as Polus, Skif-DM, GRAU index 17F19DM, was a prototype orbital weapons platform designed to destroy Strategic Defense Initiative satellites with a megawatt carbon-dioxide laser. It had a Functional Cargo Block derived from a TKS spacecraft to control its orbit and it could launch test targets to demonstrate the fire control system. History The Polyus spacecraft was launched 15 May 1987 from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 250 as part of the first flight of the Energia system, but failed to reach orbit. According to Yuri Kornilov, Chief Designer of the Salyut Design Bureau, shortly before Polyus' launch, Mikhail Gorbachev visited the Baikonur Cosmodrome and expressly forbade the in-orbit testing of its capabilities. Kornilov claims that Gorbachev was worried that it would be possible for Western governments to view this activity as an attempt to create a weapon in space and that such an attempt would contradict the country's previous statements on the USSR's peaceful intent. For technical reasons, the payload was launched upside down. It was designed to separate from the Energia, rotate 180 degrees in yaw, then 90 degrees in roll and then fire its engine to complete its boost to orbit. The Energia functioned perfectly. However, after separation from Energia, the Polyus spun a full 360 degrees instead of the planned 180 degrees. When the engine fired, it slowed and burned up in the atmosphere over the south Pacific Ocean. This failure was attributed to a faulty inertial guidance system that had not been rigorously tested due to the rushed production schedule. Parts of the Polyus project's hardware were re-used in Kvant-2, Kristall, Spektr and Priroda Mir modules, as well as in the ISS module Zarya. Development NPO Energia received orders from the Soviet government to begin research on space- based strike weapons in the mid-1970s. Even before, the USSR had been developing maneuverable satellites for the purpose of satellite interception. By the beginning of the 1980s, Energia had proposed two programs: laser- equipped Skif and guided missiles platform Kaskad (where Skif would cover the low-orbit targets, Kaskad engaged targets in high and geosynchronous orbits). Together with NPO Astrofizika and KB Salyut, they began developing their orbital weapons platform based on the Salyut DOS-17K frame. Later, when the objective of ICBM interception proved too difficult, the aims of the project were shifted towards anti-satellite weapons. The 1983 announcement by the US of their SDI program prompted further political and financial support for the satellite interceptor program. In the nuclear exchange scenario, the interceptors would destroy the SDI satellites, followed by a so-called \\"pre- emptive retaliation\\" large-scale Soviet ICBM launch. The laser chosen for the Skif spacecraft was the 1-megawatt carbon dioxide laser, developed for the Beriev A-60 aircraft (an Il-76 flying laboratory with a combat laser). The introduction of the Energia, capable of launching about 95 tonnes into orbit, finally allowed the spacecraft to accommodate the massive laser. The massive exhaust of the carbon-dioxide laser precipitated the objective of making the laser \\"recoil-less\\". The zero-torque exhaust system (SBM) was developed to that end. Its testing in orbit meant the release of a large cloud of carbon dioxide, which would hint at the satellite's purpose. Instead, the xenon- krypton mix would be used to simultaneously test the SBM and perform an innocent experiment on Earth's ionosphere. In 1985, the decision was made to test-launch the new Energia launch vehicle, which was still in the testbed phase. A 100-ton dummy payload was initially considered for the launch, but in a series of last-minute changes, it was decided that the almost-completed Skif spacecraft would be launched instead for a 30-day mission. The development of the real Skif was completed in just one year, from September 1985 to September 1986. Testing and tweaking the Energia launch vehicle, the launch pad and the Skif itself moved the launch to February, and later to May 1987. According to Boris Gubanov, the head designer of the Energia launch vehicle, the work schedule of the preceding years was exhausting, and at the point of Mikhail Gorbachev's visit on 11 May, he asked the Soviet premier to clear the launch now, because \\"there will be heart attacks\\". The catastrophic malfunction that led to Skif entering the atmosphere in the same area as Energia's second stage was successfully investigated. It was found that 568 seconds after launch, the timing control device gave the logical block a command to discard the side modules' covers and laser exhaust covers. Unknowingly, the same command was earlier used to open the solar panels and disengage the maneuvering thrusters. This wasn't discovered because of the logistics of the testing process and overall haste. Main thrusters engaged while the Skif kept turning, overshooting the intended 180-degree turn. The spacecraft lost speed and reverted to the ballistic trajectory.

Lowry became editor of National Review in 1997 when selected by its founder, William F. Buckley, Jr., to lead the magazine. Lowry is also a syndicated columnist, author, and political analyst who is a frequent guest of NBC News and Meet the Press. His most recent book, The Case for Nationalism: How it Made Us Powerful, United, and Free, was released in November 2019. Life and career Lowry was born in Arlington, Virginia, the son of a social worker mother and an English professor father. He grew up in Arlington. After graduating from Yorktown High School in Arlington, Lowry attended the University of Virginia, where he studied English and history. He was editor of the Virginia Advocate, the school's conservative monthly magazine. After graduating, he worked for Charles Krauthammer as a research assistant, and later worked as a reporter for a local newspaper in northern Virginia. In 1992, Lowry joined National Review, after finishing second in the magazine's young writers' contest. In the summer of 1994, he became the articles editor for National Review and moved to Washington DC to cover Congress. In November 1997, Lowry became editor of National Review at the age of 29, taking over from John O'Sullivan who succeeded Buckley in that position ten years earlier. At the time, Buckley said of Lowry, \\"I am very confident that I've got a very good person.\\" Lowry writes a syndicated column for King Features and is an opinion columnist with Politico. As a political commentator, he regularly appears on various cable networks, including FOX News Channel, and is a weekly guest on KCRW's Left, Right & Center. He frequently appears as a panelist on Sunday shows, including NBC's Meet the Press, ABC's This Week, and FOX News Sunday. Rich Lowry at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), March 8, 2014 Lowry has written three non-fiction books.

In June 2013, he published the political biography Lincoln Unbound. In November 2019, he published The Case for Nationalism: How it Made Us Powerful, United, and Free. In a review in Foreign Affairs, Georgetown University Professor of Government, Charles King, an expert on nationalism, criticized the book, arguing that Lowry's definition of a nation is vague, ahistorical and contradictory: \\"few of Lowry's statements would pass muster with historians\\", and Lowry's assertions about the unity, homogeneity and fixity of units such as Ancient Egypt, Korea, Japan and China \\"should be an embarrassment\\" to \\"any serious thinker.\\" Carlos Lozada was harshly critical of the book in a review for the Washington Post, describing the book as an attempt to sanitize President Donald Trump's variant of nationalism and \\"part of a larger effort on the right to create an after-the-fact framework for Trumpism, to contort the president‚Äôs utterances and impulses into a coherent worldview that can outlast him ‚Äî a sort of rescue mission for the conservative movement.\\" During the coronavirus pandemic, Lowry praised Florida governor Ron DeSantis for his hands-off approach to the coronavirus in a May 2020 column titled \\"Where does Ron DeSantis go to get his apology?\\" In the weeks that followed, coronavirus case numbers would surge in Florida. In 2009, Lowry and Keith Korman wrote Banquo's Ghosts, a political thriller. The plot revolves around a nuclear- armed Iran and an inebriated leftist journalist.

Kennedy. The book gained public attention before it was published when Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, who had initially asked Manchester to write the book, demanded that the author make changes in the manuscript. Description The book is dedicated \\"For all in whose hearts he still lives -- a watchman of honour who never sleeps\\".\\"The Death of a President November 1963\\", William Manchester, 1967 The book chronicles several days in 1963, from a small reception the Kennedys hosted in the White House the evening of the visit to Dallas, through the flight to Texas, the motorcade, the assassination, the hospital, the airplane journey back to Washington, D.C., and the funeral. The tension between the Kennedy and Johnson factions, the worldwide reaction, and Lee Harvey Oswald's televised murder by Jack Ruby are all discussed in painstaking detail. Background =Genesis= During early 1964, Jacqueline Kennedy commissioned Manchester to produce an account of the assassination. She and the Kennedy family wanted a definitive telling of the events to preempt other books, including Jim Bishop's forthcoming The Day Kennedy Was Shot.Kashner, Sam. \\"A Clash of Camelots\\" Vanity Fair, October 2009. Kennedy was familiar with Manchester's work through Portrait of a President: John F. Kennedy in Profile, his account of the president's first year and a half as President. Manchester had met and grown to admire John Kennedy when both were recovering from war wounds in Boston. The agreement stipulated that Jacqueline Kennedy and the president's brother, Robert F. Kennedy, then Attorney General, would approve the manuscript. As part of the agreement, Manchester was to receive an advance of $36,000 but only against the income from the first printing. All other earnings would go the John F. Kennedy Library. Kennedy promised Manchester exclusive interviews with members of the family, and sat for 10 hours of interviews with him. Manchester interviewed 1,000 people for the book, including Robert F. Kennedy; only Marina Oswald refused. Working 100 hours a week for two years to meet an accelerated 1967 publishing deadline, the stress of producing the book sent Manchester to a hospital due to nervous exhaustion for more than two months, where he completed a manuscript of 1,201 pages and 380,000 words. Manchester gave the manuscript to his editor at Harper & Row, Evan Thomas, and to the Kennedy family for review during March 1966. He received an offer of $665,000 from Look magazine for serial rights; his agent had obtained an agreement that payments for a serial would go to the author. =Controversy= Both Jacqueline and Robert F. Kennedy had refused to read the manuscript, delegating the review to former Kennedy administration members John Seigenthaler, Ed Guthman, and Richard N. Goodwin. They believed that passages in the book \\"unflattering\\" to Johnson might damage Robert Kennedy's political plans for 1968, and requested changes. Pam Turnure, Jacqueline Kennedy's secretary, also read the manuscript; alarmed by many \\"personal revelations\\" from Jacqueline's interviews with Manchester, such as the fact that she smoked cigarettes (something Jacqueline Kennedy had successfully hidden in the White House), she also provided lists of changes. Additionally, Jacqueline Kennedy believed that the proceeds from the Look offer should go to the Kennedy Library. She claimed that her interviews with Manchester had been intended for the library, threatened to block publication of the book unless the changes were made, unsuccessfully offered Look $1 million to cancel the serialization, and during late 1966 filed a lawsuit asking the court to issue an injunction to stop the book's publication. Newspaper articles about her decision speculated on the contents of the book. Through an out-of-court settlement during January 1967, Manchester agreed to delete 1,600 words from the serialization and seven out of 654 pages from the published book. Although headlines noted Jacqueline Kennedy as the victor, Manchester claimed that the deletions were \\"harmless\\", and retained the serialization fee. =Aftermath= Harper & Row published The Death of a President during the spring of 1967 to good reviews. It sold more than one million copies by summer and was later given the Dag Hammarskjold International Literary Prize. By 1970 the book had earned $1 million in royalties for the Kennedy Library. During 1988, the book was reprinted and Manchester wrote a new foreword. People had wondered whether he would update and modify his original work. Manchester wrote that, in his opinion, there were not any new developments. The Kennedy family retains control of materials related to Death. Jacqueline Kennedy's interview tapes with the author are sealed at the Kennedy Library until 2067. Manchester's original manuscript is held at Wesleyan University with \\"extremely restricted use\\" and, according to his son John Manchester, the Kennedy family allowed the book to go out of print. Reprints The book was reprinted during 1988, and reissued by Back Bay Books, an imprint of Little, Brown, and Company, during October 2013.Associated Press. \\" Controversial JFK book to be reissued in October\\" Yahoo!

Bush, the 43rd and at the time, incumbent U.S. President, on 19 October 2007 in Chicago, Illinois. The film is presented as a future history docudrama and uses actors, archival video footage as well as computer-generated special effects to present the hypothetical aftermath the event had on civil liberties, racial profiling, journalistic sensationalism and foreign policy. Plot Broadcast in the year 2008, the film is presented in a TV documentary style format, combining talking head interviews, news coverage clips and video surveillance footage surrounding the assassination of U.S. President George W. Bush in Chicago around a year earlier on 19 October 2007. The president is fatally shot by a sniper after he addresses an economic forum at the Chicago Sheraton Hotel, before which an anti-war rally had taken place. News outlets immediately begin reporting on the incident along with its political ramifications. After authorities earlier arrest and interrogate war-protesting detainees, Jamal Abu Zikri (Malik Bader), an IT professional of Syrian origin, becomes the prime suspect. Vice President Dick Cheney, now president, uses the possible al-Qaeda relationship in connection with the suspected assassin, Zikri, to push his own domestic political security agenda. He calls for the legislation of PATRIOT Act III, trying to increase the investigative powers of the FBI, the police, and other government agencies over American citizens and foreign residents as he contemplates attacking Syria. As his wife Zahra (Hend Ayoub) listens to the verdict with family attorney Dawn Norton (Patricia Buckley) in a packed courtroom, Zikri is convicted of killing the U.S. President and sentenced to death based upon dubious forensic evidence. Meanwhile, a new report which surfaces, substantiated by interviews with Marianne Claybon (Chavez Ravine), indicates that the perpetrator is most likely her husband Al Claybon (Tony Dale), a veteran of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, who lived in Rock Island, Illinois, and who also was the father of David Claybon, a U.S. soldier recently killed in the Iraq War. The assassin, who blames President Bush for the death of his son, killed himself after Bush's assassination. Claybon's suicide note, addressed to a second son, Casey Claybon (Neko Parham), an Iraq War veteran living in Chicago who was previously considered as a suspect, reads: Ten months after President Bush's assassination, Zikri remains on death row at the Stateville Correctional Center, because government officials are deliberately delaying his legal appeal. Moreover, in his dead father's Rock Island house, Casey Claybon finds evidence of his father's planning of the shooting. The most incriminating piece of evidence is a copy of a top secret presidential itinerary outlining, to the minute, President Bush's Chicago whereabouts on 19 October 2007. The news report ends while the U.S. Government continues investigating how presidential assassin Al Claybon obtained that top secret document. The final closing titles of the film inform the viewer that President Cheney's USA PATRIOT Act III was signed into permanent law in the U.S., stating the following: \\"It has granted investigators unprecedented powers of detention and surveillance, and further expanded the powers of the executive branch\\". Cast *Hend Ayoub as Zahra Abu Zikri, the wife of convicted assassin Jamal Abu Zikri. She comes to believe her family has been targeted by authorities due to their Middle-Eastern heritage. *Brian Boland as Larry Stafford, lead Secret Service agent assigned to the president. He ultimately failed in preventing the president from being assassinated, as he discusses the day's events and security precautions leading up to the tragedy. *Becky Ann Baker as Eleanor Drake, personal advisor to the president. She dutifully assisted in preparing his speeches and was one of the first few people to learn of his death at the hospital. *Robert Mangiardi as Greg Turner, First Deputy of the Chicago police department, in charge of coordinating security arrangements for the war protest as well as handling the blocking off of city streets for the presidential motorcade. He expresses his displeasure with the violent tone of the protesting public. *Jay Patterson as Sam McCarthy, White House correspondent for The Washington Post. From time to time, he expresses his disapproval with the government's basis for holding Zikri. He believes they have no definitive evidence linking him to the assassination other than the fact that he might have flirted with the thought of terrorism by visiting an enemy country. *Jay Whittaker as Frank Molini, a war protester caught and arrested by police in the ensuing chaos after the initial shots were fired at the president. In his possession was a banner depicting a gun being fired at Bush. However, he was later found not to be the assassin. *Michael Reilly Burke as Robert H. Maguire, special agent in charge at the FBI, involved with reporting directly to new president Dick Cheney on his investigation surrounding evidence related to the assassination. *James Urbaniak as Dr. James Pearn, an FBI forensic examiner assigned to the case to collect and catalogue evidence against any possible suspects. He obtains a partial fingerprint of Jamal Abu Zikri from traces of gunshot residue at the crime scene, but notes that it is only associative evidence and not necessarily enough evidence for a conviction in a court of law. *Neko Parham as Casey Claybon, son of possible suspected assassin Al Claybon. A war veteran who did not particularly support Bush, but who also claimed to have no knowledge of the assassination. He was initially arrested in the melee following the killing, as he walked through the streets of downtown Chicago looking for employment. *Seena Jon as Samir Masri, a Yemeni American protesting at the war rally outside where the President was speaking. Members of his family were deported back to Yemen after overstaying their travel visas following the 9/11 attacks. Masri was at the rally to protest Bush's policies and was arrested as a suspect. *Christian Stolte as John Rucinski, FBI investigator with the joint terrorism task force, assigned with interviewing detainees including Jamal Abu Zikri. Skeptical, he stresses his suspicions about Zikri's whereabouts on the day of the assassination as well as his military history after analysing his statements. *Chavez Ravine as Marianne Claybon, wife of suspected possible assassin Al Claybon. She finds it hard to comprehend her patriotic husband could have had any connection with the killing. *Patricia Buckley as Dawn Norton, Jamal Abu Zikry's defence attorney. She immediately expresses her challenging task of defending her client who the FBI believes has connections with terrorist organisations. She relates her difficulty by conveying that any person suspected of involvement with Al-Qaeda unfortunately equates to a guilty verdict in American society. *Malik Bader as Jamal Abu Zikri, the suspected assassin, a Syrian national working at an IT firm in a building neighbouring the Chicago Sheraton. He was convicted of the crime, but appealed the verdict while being held on death row due to minor forensic evidence implicating him in the assassination. *Tony Dale as Al Claybon, the figure cited as a strong likely suspect of the assassination who ended up committing suicide after he supposedly killed the president. He was a Gulf War veteran distraught over a second son's death from the Iraq War, blaming Bush for his misery. Production =Filming= The funeral scenes in the film include footage taken from archival coverage of Ronald Reagan's funeral, and President Cheney's eulogy for President Bush is a news clip of Cheney's eulogy for Reagan. CGI special effects and existing footage of President Bush helped to re-create the filming of his assassination. The rifle used by the perpetrator in the film was actually an airsoft replica of an AR-15. Image editing software was used to add the actors' images to photographs with President Bush. Although all imagery related to Bush's assassination was created using digital special effects, an apparent actual death, captured on tape, is included in the film during a piece of war footage in which an Iraqi insurgent prepares to launch a rocket, but is shot in the head first.Violence section Screen It! Except for specific scenes, most of the actors portrayed in the film were not told of the premise surrounding the story. During a post emergency surgery news conference, the chief physician's comment that he had \\"never seen such a strong heart in a man of the president's age\\", is a reference to President Ronald Reagan's own assassination attempt. In addition, the interview of a middle-aged African American outside the hospital recalls an interview of a witness on the streets of Washington, D.C. in 1981 following that assassination attempt. Filming was done entirely on location in Chicago, Illinois. =Music= The film score was composed and conducted by Richard Harvey. Sound effects and music elements were mixed by Alex Riordan. =Director's notes= The film's director, Gabriel Range, noted that the film is not \\"a leftist jeremiad\\" and further said: > The purpose of the film was not to imagine how the world stage would reset > with the assassination of George Bush.

Release The official premiere was at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival on 10 September 2006. =Television= In Europe, it was broadcast in the UK on 9 October (More4), 19 October 2006 (Channel 4), in Finland on 18 October 2007, in Switzerland on 21 August 2011 (SF 1) and in France on 28 January 2014 (Polar) =Box office= Newmarket paid one million dollars for the U.S. distribution rights. The total production budget for the film is estimated to have been two million dollars. Two of the largest U.S. cinema chains, Regal Entertainment Group and Cinemark, refused to screen the film; a Cinemark spokesman told UK newspaper The Guardian: \\"The assassination of a sitting president is problematic subject matter\\". In addition, major U.S. broadcasters CNN and National Public Radio refused to broadcast advertisements for the film. The film was screened in the U.S. for 14 days, showing at 143 theatres at its widest release. Worldwide, it grossed $869,352. The Japanese motion picture ethics committee, the Eirin, prevented Death of a President from being shown in most cinemas in 2007, saying that the film's Japanese title (\\"Bush Ansatsu\\", translated as \\"Bush Assassinated\\") is inappropriate. The film was scheduled to begin showing in Japanese cinemas on 6 October 2007. =Home media= The Region 2 Code widescreen edition of the film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 30 October 2006, followed by the Region 1 Code version in the United States on 3 April 2007. Special features include interviews and commentary with screenwriter Simon Finch, editor Brand Thumim, line producer Donall McCusker and director Gabriel Range. A theatrical trailer is also included with the extras. Reception =Politicians= The central conceit of Death of a President was much criticised by those who believed it exploited the subject of presidential assassination, and that by doing so, was in bad taste. Gretchen Esell of the Texas Republican Party described the subject matter saying, \\"I find this shocking, I find it disturbing. I don't know if there are many people in America who would want to watch something like that.\\" Hillary Clinton, then junior United States Senator from New York, told The Journal News of Rockland, Westchester, and Putnam counties at the annual New Castle Community Day in Chappaqua that, \\"I think it's despicable. I think it's absolutely outrageous. That anyone would even attempt to profit on such a horrible scenario makes me sick.\\" Simon Finch, the co-screenwriter, replied saying that Clinton had not seen the film when she commented.Interview, Canada AM (24 October 2006) The Bush administration did not comment about the film; as White House spokesperson Emily Lawrimore remarked, \\"We are not commenting because it doesn't dignify a response.\\" =Critical review= Critics had varied opinions about Death of a President. The Metacritic aggregate website rated it at 49, \\"Mixed or Average\\", based upon 30 reviews.Metacritic: \\"Death of a President\\" Rotten Tomatoes rated it at 37%, \\"Rotten\\", based upon 90 reviews.RottenTomatoes: \\"Death of a President\\" In Time magazine, Richard Corliss placed it in the context of other fictional assassinations, such as The Assassination of the Duke of Guise (1908), Suddenly (1954) and television programmes like 24 (2001‚Äì2014); concluding that it was \\"not an incendiary documentary, but a well-made political thriller.\\" In the Village Voice, J. Hoberman said it was \\"dramatically inert, but a minor techno-miracle\\" and that it \\"skews more theoretical than sensationalist ... Bush is presented as a martyr.\\" James Berardinelli commented that \\"If this was a serious examination of the possible long-term ramifications of George Bush's current foreign policy, or if it had anything interesting to say about Bush's legacy, it might be justifiable. But that's not the case. The decision to use Bush rather than a fictional representation of him is for no reason other than self-promotion.\\" Of the critics who liked Death of a President, Rex Reed of The New York Observer identified the film as \\"Clever, thoughtful, and totally believable. This is a film without a political agenda that everyone should see.\\" In the Toronto Star, Peter Howell said, \\"The film's deeper intentions ... elevate it into the company of such landmark works of historical argument as Peter Watkins's The War Game, Costa-Gavras's Z and, closer to home, Michel Brault's Les Ordres. Every thinking person should see Death of a President.\\" In Film Journal International, Frank Lovece mused that the film's condemnation \\"by politicians and pundits from James Pinkerton to Hillary Clinton is understandable and completely predictable: They can't not comment, so when they do, they have to play to their audiences. None of them seriously believes that this work of fiction will really make someone take a potshot at the president, and anyway, the attempt on President Ronald Reagan's life came out of a crazy guy's fascination with Jodie Foster, so you may as well decry movies starring blonde former child actresses.\\" Jim Emerson, editor of RogerEbert.com exclaimed, \\"Death of a President is electrifying drama, and compellingly realistic. The actors chosen for interview segments (including the mom from Freaks & Geeks as a presidential speechwriter) are unerringly authentic as real people, speaking spontaneously before a documentary lens -- even when it's clear they've rehearsed in their heads what they're going to say, and may even have told these same stories any number of times before.\\" The film has been reviewed in 2014. The Prince George Citizen columnist Neil Godbout called the film \\"a powerful statement about racial prejudice, [politicians' exploitation on] events for their own purposes, and [reporters' willingness] to tell stories [told] by government sources without question to get the scoop and break the story first.\\"Godbout, Neil (December 20, 2014). \\"Wrongful death of a movie.\\" The Prince George Citizen.

They are mainly known from Persepolis, where the massive main columns have a base, fluted shaft, and a double-animal capital, most with bulls.Curtis, 52‚Äì54; Boardman, 13‚Äì14 Achaemenid palaces had enormous hypostyle halls called apadana, which were supported inside by several rows of columns. The Throne Hall or \\"Hall of a Hundred Columns\\" at Persepolis, measuring 70 x 70 metres was built by the Achaemenid king Artaxerxes I. The Apadana hall is even larger. These often included a throne for the king and were used for grand ceremonial assemblies; the largest at Persepolis and Susa could fit ten thousand people at a time.Schmitt The Achaemenids had little experience of stone architecture, but were able to import artists and craftsmen from around their empire to develop a hybrid imperial style drawing on influences from Mesopotamia, Egypt and Lydia in Anatolia, as well as Elam in Persia itself. The style was probably developed in the Palace of Darius in Susa, but the most numerous and complete survivals are at Persepolis, where several columns remain standing.Curtis, 52‚Äì54; Boardman, 13‚Äì14 Imperial building in the style stopped abruptly with the invasion by Alexander the Great in 330 BC, when Persepolis was burned down. Description Plan, front view and side view of a typical Persepolis column The forms of the columns and capitals vary somewhat between different buildings. Generally the capitals are carved with two heavily decorated back-to-back animals projecting out from the column. These function as brackets to support the architrave or roof timbers, while the flat backs of the animals support timbers running at right angles (see the reconstruction in the Louvre below). As they project the animals may be called protomes. The bull is the most common animal, but there are also lions, bulls with the head of a man in the style of the Assyrian lamassu,Examples are in Chicago and Teheran (links to images). and griffins with the heads of eagles and the bodies of lions.Curtis, 51 The bulls and lions may reflect the symbolism around Nowruz, the Persian New Year at the spring equinox, of an eternally fighting bull personifying the moon, and a lion personifying the Sun. This was the day when tributary nations presented their annual tribute to the king, as depicted in the stairway reliefs at Persepolis, and it has been suggested that Persepolis was specifically built for Nowruz celebrations.Mousavi, Ali, Persepolis: Discovery and Afterlife of a World Wonder, p. 53, 2012, Walter de Gruyter, , 9781614510338, google books; Schmitt The capital is much longer than in most other styles of columns. While some smaller columns move quickly from the animals to the plain shaft below, the largest and grandest examples have a long intervening section with double volutes at the top and, inverted, at the bottom of a long fluted square zone, although the shaft of the column is round. At the top of the round fluted shaft are two sections with a loosely plant-based design, the upper a form of \\"palm capital\\", spreading as it rises, and the lower suggesting leaves drooping downwards. Other capitals have the animals and the two lower plant- based elements, but not the section in between with the volutes; the example in Chicago is of this type. There are various small mouldings between the various elements, reflecting a Greek style. The horns and ears of the animals are often separate pieces, fitting into the head by square plugs. The columns were polished and at least the capitals were painted, in the case of wooden ones on a plaster coating. The style reflects influences from the many cultures that the Persian Empire conquered including Egypt, Babylon, and Lydia, as well as Greece, where the Persians had only temporary success; the final result is distinctively Persian.Curtis, 51; Schmitt It is thought the stone columns that survive were preceded by wooden versions, and these continued to be used. The move to stone may have come when sufficiently large trees for the biggest buildings became difficult or impossible to source. The column shafts can be as tall as 20 metres. The base is in stone even for wooden columns, and sometimes carries an inscription saying which king erected the building. Most are round, but an early square type has two steps. Use and influence The full form of Persian column seems only to have been used at a few sites outside Persia around the empire in the Achaemenid period, in Armenia and even Levantine colonies in Iberia.Boardman, 15 The columns influenced the Pillars of Ashoka erected in India some 80 years after Alexander the Great destroyed the Persian Empire, and other imperial buildings in the architecture of the Maurya Empire.Boardman, 14‚Äì20 The much smaller Mathura lion capital of around the year 0 shows clear influence. They can be seen in relief decoration around Buddhist stupas in Gandhara in the 2nd or 3rd century AD.British Museum Stupa drum framing element containing a Persepolitan column The style did not develop in Persia itself, but elements continued to appear under later dynasties before the arrival of Islam.

The highest species diversity is in the Palearctic, with a higher diversity in Europe and eastern North America than the similar and closely related Pontia. The females of many Pieris butterflies are UV reflecting, while the male wings are strongly UV absorbing due to pigments in the scales. Ecology Many species of this genus have caterpillars which feed on cabbage and other members of the Brassicaceae. The chemical basis of this association with a certain plant group has been studied for over 100 years, and is now known to occur via a number of biochemical adaptations to chemicals called glucosinolates in these plants. In contrast to most other insects, Pieris caterpillars are able to detoxify these chemicals, and have become so specialised that they will not eat any food without glucosinolates. The Pieris females, in turn, check for the presence of glucosinolates before laying eggs on a plant. The crop-damaging species have spread from Eurasia to most of the rest of the world (most recently to South America and Africa) and are considered pest insects almost everywhere. There are species of Pieris that are not pests, such as the North American species Pieris oleracea (mustard white) and Pieris virginiensis (Virginia white). These butterflies feed successfully only on specific native vegetation.Davis, S., 2015. Evaluating threats to the rare butterfly, Pieris virginiensis. Wright State University. https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=wright1431882480&disposition;=inline Some members of Pieris are threatened by the rapid spread of some plants in the Brassicaceae, such as the way the highly invasive garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) kills the larvae of Pieris oleracea and Pieris virginiensis in North America. Given the large differences between the chemicals that garlic mustard creates versus those of mustards native to North America, it is likely that it is also lethal to other members of Pieris that are native to North America. It is listed as a suitable food plant for the Eurasian Veined white (Pieris napi). Having not evolved with garlic mustard, the aforementioned American butterflies lay eggs on it, confusing it with their host plants due to a similar odor. Just because butterflies are members of Pieris does not mean they are all capable of feeding on the same members of Brassicaceae that other members of Pieris can feed on.Driesche, F.V.; Blossey, B.; Hoodle, M.; Lyon, S.; Reardon, R., 2010.

They vary from about a minute to five minutes in length. They are among Brahms's most popular works and were the most profitable for him. Each dance has been arranged for a wide variety of instruments and ensembles. Brahms originally wrote the version for piano four hands (piano duet: two players using one piano) and later arranged the first ten dances for solo piano. Background In 1850 Brahms met the Hungarian violinist Ede Rem√©nyi and accompanied him in a number of recitals over the next few years. This was his introduction to \\"gypsy-style\\" music such as the csardas, which was later to prove the foundation of his most lucrative and popular compositions, the two sets of Hungarian Dances (published 1869 and 1880). Only numbers 11, 14 and 16 are entirely original compositions. The better-known Hungarian Dances include Nos. 1 and 5, the latter of which was based on the cs√°rd√°s \\"\\" (Memories of B√°rtfa) by Hungarian composer B√©la K√©ler, which Brahms mistakenly thought was a traditional folksong. A footnote on the Ludwig-Masters edition of a modern orchestration of Hungarian Dance No.1 states: \\"The material for this dance is believed to have come from the Divine Cs√°rd√°s (ca. 1850) of Hungarian composer and conductor Miska Borz√≥.\\" List Book 1.

Other composers have orchestrated the other dances. These composers include Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k (Nos. 17 to 21), Andreas Hall√©n (Nos. 2, 4 and 7), Paul Juon (No. 4), Martin Schmeling (1864‚Äì1943) (Nos. 5 to 7), Hans G√°l (Nos. 8 and 9), (Nos. 5, 6 and 11 to 16) and (Nos. 4, 8 and 9). More recently, Iv√°n Fischer has orchestrated the complete set. Brahms's Hungarian Dances were influential in the development of ragtime. See, for example, the role of German-American piano teacher Julius Weiss in ragtime composer Scott Joplin's early life and career. Recordings The earliest known recording of any movement of Hungarian Dances was a condensed piano-based rendition of Hungarian Dance No. 1, from 1889, played by Brahms himself, and was known to have been recorded by Theo Wangemann, an assistant to Thomas Edison. The following dialogue can be heard in the recording itself, before the music starts: * Theo Wangemann: \\"Dezember 1889.\\" * Johannes Brahms: \\"Im Haus von Herrn Doktor Fellinger bei Herrn Doktor Brahms, Johannes Brahms.\\" (English: \\"In the house of Dr. Fellinger with Dr. Brahms, Johannes Brahms.\\") Joseph Joachim, a close friend of Brahms, in collaboration with an unnamed accompanying pianist, recorded their own renditions of Hungarian Dances Nos. 1 and 2. Leopold Stokowski's very first recordings with the Philadelphia Orchestra were devoted to Hungarian Dances Nos. 5 and 6. They were recorded by the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey in 1917. The Boston Pops Orchestra with conductor Arthur Fiedler recorded Hungarian Dances Nos. 5 and 6 in Symphony Hall, Boston. Hungarian Dance No. 5 was recorded on June 25, 1950. It was released by RCA Victor as catalog number 10-3254B (in USA) and by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalog number B 10631\\\\. Hungarian Dance No. 6 was recorded on June 16, 1950. It was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number (in the USA) and by EMI on the His Master's Voice label as catalog number B 10631\\\\. These were 78 rpm discs. The pieces were arranged by Albert Parlow. Julius Katchen and Jean-Pierre Marty recorded the complete set in the 1960s, as part of Katchen's recording of the complete piano works of Brahms. Aloys and Alfons Kontarsky recorded them in 1976 for Deutsche Grammophon, released originally on LP catalog number 2530 710\\\\. The French sister duo- pianists Katia and Marielle Lab√®que recorded the complete set of dances for Philips in 1981, as catalog number 4164592. Dances Nos. 17, 19 and 21 were recorded in 1966 by the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra for their album Orchestral Fireworks, released in the UK on the Music For Pleasure label. The complete orchestral versions were recorded digitally by Claudio Abbado and the Vienna Philharmonic for Deutsche Grammophon in 1982, released on LP as and on CD as . The complete orchestral versions were again recorded digitally by and the Budapest Symphony Orchestra for Naxos in 1988, released on CD as 8.550110.

At least thirteen of his novels have been New York Times Best Sellers. Early life Brown was born in Buffalo, New York, and was one of six children. At 15, he began flying instruction, eventually earning a private pilot's license. He graduated in 1978 from Penn State University with a degree in Western European history. Career =Military= Brown joined the Air Force ROTC while in college. He received a commission in the United States Air Force in 1978. He was a navigator- bombardier (now known as a weapon systems officer (WSO)) in the B-52 Stratofortress G-model long-range heavy bomber and the FB-111A Aardvark medium range fighter-bomber. Brown received several military decorations and awards, including the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Combat Crew Award, and the Marksmanship ribbon. He rose to the rank of Captain and has 2,500 hours of flight time in B-52s. He left the Air Force in 1986, having never seen combat. He is a Life Member of the Air Force Association and the U.S. Naval Institute. =Writing= Brown's first paid writing was a review of Fort Apocalypse for Compute!'s Gazette. In 1986, while still in the Air Force at Mather Air Force Base in Sacramento County, California, he wrote his first book, Flight of the Old Dog. His novels have been published in eleven languages and distributed to over 70 countries. He published 11 bestsellers in 11 years. Brown has been represented by literary agent Robert Gottlieb of Trident Media Group. Bibliography Brown tends to stay with the same characters over a long period of time. Many of the characters introduced in Flight of the Old Dog are still around for the latest, although a few have been killed in previous books. Most of his books occur in the same timeline, with a few exceptions. * Silver Tower, published after Flight of the Old Dog, a mostly independent novel with no character references, is first linked by mention of the SkyBolt module in Battle Born. However, the novel is merged into the Patrick McLanahan saga when some of its main characters and the fictional military space station Armstrong appear in Strike Force. * Chains of Command, which features Rebecca Furness and Darren Mace, was actually a separate series, but later, the characters reappeared in Battle Born and were merged into the Dreamland and McLanahan series. * Hammerheads focuses on Admiral Ian Hardcastle, who later reappeared in Storming Heaven. However, the book can be part of the overall Patrick McLanahan continuity because of his and General Elliott's appearances, plus the book taking place over two years since the events of Flight of the Old Dog (which is referred to in passing). * The Dreamland series coauthored with Jim DeFelice covers the gaps between the Patrick McLanahan series novels. While most of the old characters are only mentioned in passing, some of the technology depicted in the series was later merged into the main series, starting with Air Battle Force. * Henri Cazaux, the main villain of Storming Heaven, was referred to in The Tin Man. His own right-hand man, Gregory Townsend, would be the book's main antagonist. =Patrick McLanahan series= Brown's novels mostly center on a character named Patrick McLanahan, whose exploits as a US Air Force officer date back over 25 years. #Flight of the Old Dog (1987) - A Soviet anti-ballistic missile laser destroys US strategic assets while the Kremlin argues the system's legality before the UN. USAF Lieutenant General Bradley Elliott recruits a team of officers to work on a modified B-52 bomber, called the Old Dog. A raid on Dreamland, itself coupled by the discovery of a B-1 Lancer strike team on the Soviet laser, forces the Old Dog crew to take the mission on themselves. In a heroic act, crewmember David Luger risks his life to save the bomber from destruction. #Sky Masters (1991) - The pullout of US forces from the Philippines in 1994 sparks Chinese plans to occupy the Spratly Islands and Mindanao with the connivance of a Filipino Communist vice-president who declares a coup. McLanahan and the heavy bombers of the US Air Battle Force lead the American counterattack over Davao City. The novel also has a small cameo appearance by Day of the Cheetah antagonist Kenneth Francis James. #Night of the Hawk (1992) - A simple defector extraction raid in Lithuania in late 1992 uncovers evidence that a member of the Old Dog crew, David Luger, survived the events of Flight of the Old Dog and was brainwashed to work on a new stealth bomber at a secret facility in Vilnius. Amidst the political upheaval in the country, General Elliott, McLanahan, and John Ormack join a US Marine contingent in assaulting the facility and rescuing Luger. #Day of the Cheetah (1989) - In 1996, Kenneth Francis James - a Soviet deep-cover agent posing as a USAF officer - steals the new Dreamstar thought-controlled fighter. McLanahan and the High- Technology Aerospace Weapons Center scramble to recover it from James, or destroy it if necessary. #Shadows of Steel (1996) - In May 1997, the US initiates covert operations to stop Iran's new carrier task force from controlling the Persian Gulf sea lanes. Now running a diner in Sacramento after the fiasco depicted in Day of the Cheetah, Patrick McLanahan is recalled to active duty to fly a B-2 Spirit mission over Iran. #Fatal Terrain (1997) - Set a month after the ending of Shadows of Steel, Taiwan's declaration of independence forces China to go to war. The Old Dog crew is brought back to save the world from Chinese domination, but not everyone could come home alive. #The Tin Man (1998) - A few months after the events of Fatal Terrain, Patrick McLanahan faces a new enemy, right in his home turf in Sacramento, California. The novel also introduces his brother, Sacramento police officer Paul McLanahan. #Battle Born (1999) - In 2000, McLanahan is assigned to turn a group of Nevada Air Guard B-1 pilots into America's premier tactical air strike force. A new threat created by a sudden reunification of the Korean peninsula hastens the training. #Warrior Class (2001) - Set in 2001, Russian billionaire Pavel Kazakov builds a huge pipeline through the Balkans with the support of the Russian Army and everybody gets rich. To make the scheme viable, he also finances the deployment of a secret stealth fighter-bomber originally developed by the same company that employed Dave Luger. However, a new US president and his brand of leadership tie McLanahan's hands from doing anything about Kazakov. #Wings of Fire (2002) - When Libya plots to invade and control Egypt, McLanahan and his advanced force, the Night Stalkers, are sent in to stop the chaos. However, the consequences are personal for his family. #Air Battle Force (2003) - The US deploys a new aerial strike force into Turkmenistan to fight a ragtag Taliban army and later a Russian invasion. The humiliation forces Russian General Anatoly Gryzlov to launch a coup, especially after McLanahan's forces level the Russian Air Force's strategic bomber base in Engels. #Plan of Attack (2004) - Out of revenge for what happened in Air Battle Force, General Gryzlov orders a nuclear bomber strike against the United States, eliminating nearly all of its land-based strategic forces. Demoted to brigadier general and reassigned off the Air Battle Force after defying one order too many in Turkmenistan, McLanahan tries to convince the Air Force leadership about the threat. When the Russians attack, he and the rest of the Dreamland crew take matters into their own hands to save what is left of America. #Strike Force (2007) - Three years after the events of Plan of Attack, now-Lieutenant General McLanahan uses new XR-A9 Black Stallion spaceplanes to intervene during a new crisis in Iran, where Shadows of Steel antagonist General Hesarak al-Buzhazi has launched a rebellion against the fundamentalist regime. #Shadow Command (2008) - Set in 2009, the novel pits McLanahan and his team against a new US president, Joseph Gardner, who connives with Russia to take him down. #Rogue Forces (2009) - Reverting to the private sector, Patrick McLanahan and former US President Kevin Martindale operate their own Private military company (PMC), Scion Aviation International. Their latest contract: stabilizing Iraq as US forces withdraw from the country. However, Kurdish raids into Turkey force Ankara to unleash its arsenal of former US aircraft against the rebels and McLanahan's team is caught in the crossfire. #Executive Intent (2010) - The US deploys a new orbital bombardment system, the Thor's Hammer, with a Pakistani ballistic- missile battery hijacked by terrorists firing on Indian cities as the first target. However, some of the missiles destroys a chemical weapon, of which the chemicals injure civilians, which prompts Pakistan and nearby countries to help grant Indian Ocean access to China and Russia. McLanahan must join forces with Brigadier-General Kai Raydon to prevent war. Meanwhile, US Vice-President Kenneth Phoenix begins challenging President Gardner's leadership. #A Time For Patriots (2011) - An economic collapse in late 2012 triggers destabilization efforts in the entire country. Now retired and flying for the Civil Air Patrol, McLanahan and his son Bradley enlists fellow citizens to eliminate a new terrorist threat. #Tiger's Claw (2012) - China's test of a new anti- ballistic missile system in 2013 threatens US forces in the Pacific. Still reeling from the recession depicted in the previous novel, President Kenneth Phoenix recalls McLanahan again for combat duty - with Bradley James along for the ride after being kicked out of the Air Force Academy. The twice-retired general uses a new combined-arms concept using B-1s to challenge the People's Liberation Army (PLA), which has rolled out a massive arsenal. However, a raid into China turns out to be the elder McLanahan's last. #Starfire (2014) - Bradley struggles to live without his father by devoting his efforts to develop and launch a new orbital solar power plant that has the potential to aid space exploration. However, with China and Russia flexing their military muscle, US President Phoenix pushes ahead with the militarization of space. #Iron Wolf (2015) - When Russia invades Ukraine to protect ethnic Russians, a small group of surviving Ukrainian soldiers provoke the Russian military, hoping for a response that will draw in NATO. The Polish government worries about Russia's aggression and hires Scion Aviation to defend them against Russia. Brad McLanahan is pulled out of his internship at Sky Masters to mold the individual hot-shot pilots of Scion into an effective fighting force. #Price of Duty (2017) - Russia builds a new cyber warfare facility to take on the new Alliance of Free Nations, and Scion's Iron Wolf team must work to protect the Alliance from Russia's ambitions to bring back the old Soviet. #The Moscow Offensive (2018) - Brad McLanahan and the heroes of the Iron Wolf Squadron‚Äîmust counter a dangerous Russian strike from within the homeland. #The Kremlin Strike (publish date May 2019) - no description given. =Act of War series= * Act of War (2005) - The US assembles Task Force Talon, a special anti-terrorist unit of military personnel and police officers equipped with the most advanced combat equipment. Their first assignment: to destroy GAMMA, a terrorist group that detonated a nuclear device on a major facility run by top energy producer Kingman Group. * Edge of Battle (2006) - Rivalry between drug lords in Mexico and an increased flow of illegal immigrants across the US border heightens the tension between both countries. Task Force Talon is assigned to man a new base in southern California to combat the threat. =Independent series= * Silver Tower (1988) - The US successfully activates the new military space station Armstrong in the then-future of 1992. Feeling threatened by the station's potential for US space supremacy, the USSR plots to destroy it as part of a plan to invade Iran and threaten the Persian Gulf oil reserves. It is up to General Jason St Michael and his team aboard the Armstrong to stop Soviet forces coming into the area. * Hammerheads (1990) - The US activates the new Border Security Force as part of efforts to stop drug smuggling operations handled by a former Cuban Air Force officer in cahoots with the Medellin cartel (with Patrick McLanahan and General Elliott making cameo appearances). * Chains of Command (1993) - Russian President Valentin Sen'kov plans an invasion of the Ukraine in 1995. When the invasion gets underway, the US is prompted to send an Air Force Reserve F-111 unit to help the Ukrainians. The novel introduces future McLanahan saga characters Lieutenant Colonel Darren Mace and Major Rebecca Furness, the USAF's first female combat pilot. * Storming Heaven (1994) - The absence of an air-defense network on US soil prompts terrorist Henri Cazaux to use airliners covertly equipped with bombs in attacking many airports. When the danger goes national, Hammerheads protagonist Ian Hardcastle, now an admiral, is tasked with getting the network up and running to stop Cazaux's activities. =Short stories= * Leadership Material (2001) - Set in the Arabian Peninsula post-Desert Storm in March 1991, then-Major McLanahan flies with the Old Dog crew in combating an Iranian Blackjack-E, a version of the TU-160 Blackjack bomber that was reportedly upgraded with designs lifted from the Megafortress. Meanwhile, back in the US, Colonel Norman Weir, an officer on the USAF promotions board, reviews McLanahan's service record as a candidate for lieutenant colonel and recommends his discharge. However, the US president orders Weir to destroy the discharge form, saying that McLanahan has proven himself as an officer (without elaborating further). The story was Brown's contribution to Stephen Coonts' Combat war stories anthology. It has peripheral references to Hammerheads and Sky Masters (although a canonical error). =Dreamland series= Brown and Jim DeFelice have created more than a dozen Dale Brown's Dreamland books. # Dreamland (2001) # Nerve Center (2002) # Razor's Edge (2002) # Piranha (2003) # Strike Zone (2004) # Armageddon (2004) # Satan's Tail (2005) # End Game (2006) # Retribution (2007) # Revolution (2008) # Whiplash (2009) # Black Wolf (2010) # Raven Strike (2011) # Collateral Damage (2012) # Drone Strike (2014) # Target Utopia (2015) # Puppet Master (2016) # Act of Revenge (2018) Personal life In 1994, Brown resided in Folsom, California, near Sacramento, California. He enjoys flying his plane, a Grumman Gulfstream II. He is a mission pilot in the Civil Air Patrol. On the ground, he enjoys tennis, motorcycling, skiing, scuba diving, and ice hockey. Brown is married. His wife Diane is a retired Sacramento police lieutenant and (like her husband) is also a pilot. They have a son, Hunter, and they reside near Lake Tahoe, Nevada. =Legal issues= In April 2004, Brown pleaded guilty to charges of tax fraud. He was charged with creating companies in the West Indies for the purposes of receiving tax deductions from fictitious expenses. The fictitious expenses amounted to more than $440,000, which Brown claimed on his 1998 income tax filing. He then used the tax deductions to remodel his home in Incline Village, Nevada.

He is known for his study of the works of actor and director John Cassavetes. He teaches in the Film & Television department of the College of Communication at Boston University and has published several books on American art and film. Background Carney was educated at Harvard (magna cum laude) and Rutgers. Professor Carney taught literature at Middlebury College and Humanities at the University of Texas at Dallas. He was also a William Rice Kimball Fellow at Stanford, working on a study of performance art, particularly the stand up comedy of Richard Pryor and Lenny Bruce. Viewpoints Carney is highly critical of Hollywood filmmaking, and the way it is approached from an academic standpoint. He is well known for the controversial stridency with which he attacks directors such as Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, the Coen brothers, Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles, David Lynch and Quentin Tarantino, whom he describes as tricksters using empty style and pseudo-intellectualism to score points with an \\"in\\" crowd. Carney often refers to Spielberg's output after Schindler's List (1993) as \\"Steven 'Please take me seriously' Spielberg movies\\". Carney is as critical of the academic establishment that gives plaudits to these directors as he is of the filmmakers themselves. In his 1989 Alaska Quarterly Review essay on Woody Allen, \\"Modernism for the Millions,\\" Carney notes that Allen uses humour in his films to defuse situations that he, the filmmaker, is uncomfortable with, such as drug use and depression. At the same time, Allen wants to get credit for bringing up these issues, as that is what serious artists do. Carney argues that an emphasis on interpreting symbolism shows a \\"high school\\" understanding of art, and that this kind of \\"decoder ring\\" approach is in place because it is easier to grasp and makes scholars feel more important and esoteric. Carney believes that the meaning of a creative work lies at its surface, and imagines a world where art is appreciated for what it objectively contains rather than what is read into it, an aesthetic he refers to as pragmatic. He argues that audiences can, for example, simply appreciate the acting in a film and gain meaning from this, what the characters actually say and do, and the tonal shifts that accompany these actions. Controversy He feuded with Gena Rowlands over his discovery of the first cut of the 1959 film Shadows claiming to be his own and not of Faces International.Fake Independence and Reel Truth, Pt. 1: Ray Carney‚Äôs incendiary film criticism feels as vital today as it did 15 years ago-MovieMaker In May 2012, Mark Rappaport filed a lawsuit against Carney for refusing to give back more than two dozen film reels, 16 videotapes, 14 scripts, and papers including rough drafts of Rappaport's movies which the filmmaker had previously entrusted to Carney to transport to Paris. Carney, however, has maintained that Rappaport actually gave him the items as gifts and is now engaging in cyber bullying against him. No written agreement was signed when the material was shipped to Carney. The suit was dropped in September of that same year, due to rising legal costs, although Rappaport later started an online petition demanding that Carney return the items.

In 2003, Carney's research led to the discovery of the first version of Cassavetes's seminal work Shadows.. Besides his work on John Cassavetes, Carney has written on Carl Theodor Dreyer, Frank Capra, and Mike Leigh.

K√∂stenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 page 114 Isaac Newton's astronomical method calculates those ancient Passovers (always defined by a full moon) which are preceded by a Friday, as specified by all four Gospels; this leaves two potential crucifixion dates, 7 April AD 30 and 3 April AD 33. In the lunar eclipse method, the Apostle Peter's statement that the moon turned to blood at the crucifixion (Acts of the Apostles 2:14‚Äì21) is taken to refer to the lunar eclipse of 3 April AD 33; although astronomers are discussing whether the eclipse was visible as far west as Jerusalem. Recent astronomical research uses the contrast between the synoptic date of Jesus' last Passover on the one hand with John's date of the subsequent \\"Jewish Passover\\" on the other hand, to propose Jesus' Last Supper to have been on Wednesday, 1 April AD 33 and the crucifixion on Friday 3 April AD 33 and the Resurrection two days later.

One indication that the gospels are theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one-third of their text to just seven days, namely the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem, also known as the Passion of Christ.Matthew by David L. Turner 2008 page 613 Nevertheless, the gospels provide some details regarding events which can be clearly dated, so one can establish date ranges regarding major events in Jesus' life by comparison with independent sources. A number of historical non-Christian documents, such as Jewish and Greco-Roman sources, have been used in historical analyses of the chronology of Jesus.Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 pages 431‚Äì436 Virtually all modern historians agree that Jesus existed, and regard his baptism and his crucifixion as historical events, and assume that approximate ranges for these events can be estimated.In a 2011 review of the state of modern scholarship, Bart Ehrman wrote: \\"He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees\\" B. Ehrman, 2011 Forged : writing in the name of God . page 285 Using these methods, most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 and 4 BC, and that Jesus' preaching began around AD 27‚Äì29 and lasted one to three years. They calculate the death of Jesus as having taken place between AD 30 and 36.  Year of Jesus' birth  The date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC. Two main methods have been used to estimate the year of the birth of Jesus: one based on the accounts of his birth in the gospels with reference to King Herod's reign, and another based on subtracting his stated age of \\"about 30 years\\" from the time when he began preaching (Luke 3:23) in \\"the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar\\" (Luke 3:1-2): the two methods indicate a date of birth before Herod's death in 4 BC, and a date of birth around 2 BC, respectively.Nikos Kokkinos, 1998, in Chronos, kairos, Christos 2 by Ray Summers, Jerry Vardaman pages 121‚Äì126Murray, Alexander, \\"Medieval Christmas\\", History Today, December 1986, 36 (12), pp. 31 ‚Äì 39.Jack V.

However, some consistent elements are evidently derived from a common early tradition:Ulrich Luz: Die Geburtsgeschichten Jesu und die Geschichte. G√∂ttingen 2013, S. 170 *Jesus was born under the Judean king Herod the Great (Matthew 2:1f; Luke 1:5 vs Luke 2:1f) *in Bethlehem (Matthew 2:5f; Luke 2:4.15) *prior to his parents moving to Nazareth (Matthew 2:22f), or before their return to Nazareth (Luke 2,39). *Jesus' parents Mary and Joseph were betrothed (Matthew 1:18‚Äì20; Luke 1:27; 2:5). * His birth was a virgin birth conceived by the Holy Spirit. * Angels announced Jesus' birth, his name, his role as the Messiah (being a descendant of King David and the son of God), and his mission to save his people from sin (Matthew 1:21; Luke 1:77; 2:11,30). Thus both Luke and Matthew independently associate Jesus' birth with the reign of Herod the Great.Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi by Karl Rahner 2004 page 731 Matthew furthermore implies that Jesus was up to two years old when Herod reportedly ordered the Massacre of the Innocents, that is, the murder of all boys in Bethlehem up to the age of two (Matthew 2:16). Most scholarship concerning the date of Herod's death follows Emil Sch√ºrer's calculations published in 1896, which revised a traditional death date of 1 BC to 4 BC.Sch√ºrer, Emil. A History of the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus Christ, 5 vols. New York, Scribner's, 1896.Barnes, Timothy David. \\"The Date of Herod's Death,\\" Journal of Theological Studies ns 19 (1968), 204‚Äì219Bernegger, P. M. \\"Affirmation of Herod's Death in 4 B.C.\\", Journal of Theological Studies ns 34 (1983), 526‚Äì531. Two of Herod's sons, Archelaus and Philip the Tetrarch, dated their rule from 4 BC,Josephus, Wars, 1.631‚Äì632. though Archelaus apparently held royal authority during Herod's lifetime.Josephus, Wars, 2.26. Philip's reign would last for 37 years, until his death in the traditionally accepted 20th year of Tiberius (AD 34), which implies his accession as 4 BC.Hoehner, Harold. Herod Antipas, (Zondervan, 1980) p.251. The oldest manuscripts of Josephus‚Äôs Antiquities has the death of Philip in the 22nd year not the 20th, of Tiberius. In the British Library there is not a single manuscript prior to AD 1544 that has the traditionally accepted 20th year of Tiberius for the death of Philip. This evidence removes the main obstacle for a later date of 1BC for the death of Herod. A list of the oldest manuscripts is found p 91 ‚ÄúJosephus Re-examined‚Äù, D. Beyer. Some scholars support the traditional date of 1 BC for Herod's death.Edwards, Ormond. \\"Herodian Chronology\\", Palestine Exploration Quarterly 114 (1982) 29‚Äì42Keresztes, Paul.

(Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1998) 300, ¬ß516. Filmer and Steinmann, for example, propose that Herod died in 1 BC, and that his heirs backdated their reigns to 4 or 3 BC to assert an overlapping with Herod's rule, and bolster their own legitimacy.Steinmann, Andrew.

E. \\"Chronology of the Reign of Herod the Great\\", Journal of Theological Studies ns 17 (1966), 283‚Äì298.Marshall, Taylor. The Eternal City (Dallas: St. John, 2012), pp. 35‚Äì65. In Josephus' account, Herod's death was preceded by a lunar eclipse and followed by Passover.Josephus, Antiquities, 17.6.4 An eclipse took place in 4 BC on 13 March, about 29 days before Passover, and this eclipse has been suggested as the one referred to by Josephus. There were however other eclipses during this period, and there are proponents of 5 BC and the two eclipses of 1 BC occurring 10 January and 29 December. Nevertheless, most scholars favour a birth year for Jesus between 6 and 4 BC.Michael Grant, Jesus: An Historian's Review of the Gospels, Scribner's, 1977, p. 71.Ben Witherington III, \\"Primary Sources,\\" Christian History 17 (1998) No. 3:12‚Äì20.New Testament History by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 pages 121‚Äì124 =Subtracting Jesus' age of \\"about 30 years\\" when preaching= Another approach to estimating Jesus' year of birth is based on the statement in Luke 3:23 that he was \\"about 30 years of age\\" when starting his ministry. Jesus began to preach after being baptised by John the Baptist, and based on Luke‚Äôs gospel John only began baptising people in \\"the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar\\" (Luke 3:1‚Äì2), which scholars estimate to have been in AD 28‚Äì29.Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible 2000 Amsterdam University Press page 249 Subtracting 30 years, it appears that Jesus was born in 1-2 BC. However, if the phrase \\"about 30\\" is interpreted to mean 32 years old, this could fit a date of birth just within the reign of Herod, who died in 4 BC. The benchmark date of AD 28‚Äì29 is independently confirmed by John's statement (John 2:20) that the Temple reportedly was in its 46th year of construction during Passover when Jesus began his ministry, which likewise corresponds to 28‚Äì29 AD according to scholarly estimates. =Other approaches= The Gospel of John 8:57 mentions in passing an upper limit of 50 for Jesus' age when preaching: \\"The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?\\" Fifty years is a round number which emphasises the discrepancy to Jesus's claim he had existed before Abraham, that is, for more than a thousand years.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , page 72 Some commentators have attempted to establish the date of birth by identifying the Star of Bethlehem with some known astronomical or astrological phenomenon. For example, astronomer Michael Molnar proposed 17 April 6 BC as the likely date of the Nativity, since that date corresponded to the heliacal rising and lunar occultation of Jupiter, while it was momentarily stationary in the constellation of Aries. According to Molnar, to knowledgeable astrologers of this time, this highly unusual combination of events would have indicated that a regal personage would be (or had been) born in Judea.Michael R. Molnar, The Star of Bethlehem: The Legacy of the Magi, Rutgers University Press, 1999. Other research points to a 1991 report from the Royal Astronomical Society, which mentions that Chinese astronomers noted a \\"comet\\" that lasted 70 days in the Capricorn region of the sky, in March of 5 BC. Authors Dugard and O'Reilly consider this event as the likely Star of Bethlehem.O'Reilly, Bill, and Dugard, Martin, Killing Jesus: A History, Henry Holt and Company, 2013, , page 15. However, there are many possible phenomena and none seems to match the Gospel account exactly.Raymond E. Brown, 101 Questions and Answers on the Bible, Paulist Press (2003), page 79. Years of preaching =Reign of Tiberius and the Gospel of Luke= Part of the Madaba Map showing Bethabara (ŒíŒ≠Œ∏Œ±Œ≤Œ±œÅŒ¨), calling it the place where John baptised One method for the estimation of the date of the beginning of the ministry of Jesus is based on the Gospel of Luke's specific statement in Luke 3:1‚Äì2 about the ministry of John the Baptist which preceded that of Jesus: > Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate > being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his > brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and > Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, > the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. The reign of Tiberius Caesar began on the death of his predecessor Augustus Caesar in September AD 14, implying that the ministry of John the Baptist began in late AD 28 or early AD 29.Andreas J. K√∂stenberger, L. Scott Kellum, Charles L Quarles, The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown (B&H; Publishing, 2009), page 139-140.Luke 1‚Äì5: New Testament Commentary by John MacArthur 2009 page 201 Riesner's alternative suggestion is that John the Baptist began his ministry in AD 26 or 27, because Tiberius ruled together with Augustus for two years before becoming the sole ruler. If so, the fifteenth year of Tiberius' reign would be counted from AD 12. Riesner's suggestion is however considered less likely, as all the major Roman historians who calculate the years of Tiberius' rule ‚Äì namely Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio ‚Äì count from AD 14 ‚Äì the year of Augustus' death. In addition, coin evidence shows that Tiberius started to reign in AD 14.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , page 64 The New Testament presents John the Baptist as the precursor to Jesus and the Baptism of Jesus as marking the beginning of Jesus' ministry.Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 page 224-229Christianity: an introduction by Alister E. McGrath 2006 pages 16‚Äì22 In his sermon in Acts 10:37‚Äì38, delivered in the house of Cornelius the centurion, Apostle Peter refers to what had happened \\"throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached\\" and that Jesus had then gone about \\"doing good\\".Who is Jesus?: an introduction to Christology by Thomas P. Rausch 2003 page Jesus' baptism account is followed directly by his 40 day fast and ordeal. =The Temple in Jerusalem and the Gospel of John= Herod's Temple, referred to in John 2:13, as imagined in the Holyland Model of Jerusalem. It is currently situated adjacent to the Shrine of the Book exhibit at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. Another method for estimating the start of the ministry of Jesus without reliance on the Synoptic gospels is to relate the account in the Gospel of John about the visit of Jesus to Herod's Temple in Jerusalem with historical data about the construction of the Temple. John 2:13 says that Jesus went to the Temple in Jerusalem around the start of his ministry and in John 2:20 Jesus is told: \\"This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?\\". Herod's Temple in Jerusalem was an extensive and long term construction on the Temple Mount, which was never fully completed even by the time it was destroyed by the Romans in AD 70.The biblical engineer: how the temple in Jerusalem was built by Max Schwartz 2002 pages xixx-xx Having built entire cities such as Caesarea Maritima, Herod saw the construction of the Temple as a key, colossal monument. The dedication of the initial temple (sometimes called the inner Temple) followed a 17 or 18 month construction period, just after the visit of Augustus to Syria.The building program of Herod the Great by Duane W. Roller 1998 University of California Press pages 67‚Äì71 Josephus (Ant 15.11.1) states that the temple's reconstruction was started by Herod in the 18th year of his reign.Encyclopedia of the historical Jesus by Craig A. Evans 2008 page 115 But there is some uncertainty about how Josephus referred to and computed dates, which event marked the start of Herod's reign, and whether the initial date should refer to the inner Temple, or the subsequent construction. Hence various scholars arrive at slightly different dates for the exact date of the start of the Temple construction, varying by a few years in their final estimation of the date of the Temple visit.The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J. K√∂stenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 pages 140‚Äì141 Given that it took 46 years of construction, the best scholarly estimate for when Jesus preached is around the year AD 29.Andreas J.

Maier refer to Herod Antipas killing John the Baptist, and to the marriage of Herod and Herodias, establishing two key connections between Josephus and the biblical episodes. Josephus refers to the imprisonment and execution of John the Baptist by Herod Antipas and that Herodias left her husband to marry Herod Antipas, in defiance of Jewish law.Ant 18.5.2‚Äì4 Josephus and the gospels differ, however, on the details and motives, e.g. whether the execution was a consequence of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias (as indicated in Matthew 14:4, Mark 6:18), or a pre-emptive measure by Herod which possibly took place before the marriage to quell a possible uprising based on the remarks of John, as Josephus suggests in Ant 18.5.2.Jesus in history, thought, and culture: an encyclopedia, Volume 1 by James Leslie Houlden 2003 pages 508‚Äì509 Women in scripture by Carol Meyers, Toni Craven and Ross Shepard Kraemer 2001 pages 92‚Äì93 Herod Antipas in Galilee: The Literary and Archaeological Sources by Morten H. Jensen 2010 pages 42‚Äì43 The Emergence of Christianity: Classical Traditions in Contemporary Perspective by Cynthia White 2010 page 48 The Baptist scolds Herod. Fresco by Masolino, 1435 The exact year of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias is subject to debate among scholars. While some scholars place the year of the marriage in the range AD 27‚Äì31, others have approximated a date as late as AD 35, although such a late date has much less support. In his analysis of Herod's life, Harold Hoehner estimates that John the Baptist's imprisonment probably occurred around AD 30‚Äì31. The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia estimates the death of the Baptist to have occurred about AD 31‚Äì32. Josephus stated (Ant 18.5.2) that the AD 36 defeat of Herod Antipas in the conflicts with Aretas IV of Nabatea was widely considered by the Jews of the time as misfortune brought about by Herod's unjust execution of John the Baptist.The relationship between John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth by Daniel S. Dapaah 2005 page 48 Given that John the Baptist was executed before the defeat of Herod by Aretas, and based on the scholarly estimates for the approximate date of the marriage of Herod Antipas and Herodias, the last part of the ministry of John the Baptist and hence parts of the ministry of Jesus fall within the historical time span of AD 28‚Äì35, with the later year 35 having the least support among scholars.Herod Antipas by Harold W.

Another approach to estimating an upper bound for the year of death of Jesus is the estimation of the date of conversion of Paul the Apostle which the New Testament accounts place some time after the death of Jesus. Paul's conversion is discussed in both the Letters of Paul and in the Acts of the Apostles.Bromiley, Geoffrey William (1979). International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: A‚ÄìD Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company. pp. 689. . In the First Epistle to the Corinthians (15:3‚Äì8), Paul refers to his conversion. The Acts of the Apostles includes three separate references to his conversion experience, in Acts 9, Acts 22 and Acts 26.Paul and His Letters by John B. Polhill 1999 pages 49‚Äì50The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology by William Lane Craig, James Porter Moreland 2009 page 616 Estimating the year of Paul's conversion relies on working backwards from his trial before Junius Gallio in Achaea, Greece (Acts 18:12‚Äì17) around AD 51‚Äì52, a date derived from the discovery and publication, in 1905, of four stone fragments as part of the Delphi Inscriptions, at Delphi across the Gulf from Corinth.Paul: his letters and his theology by Stanley B.

Polhill, Paul and His Letters, B&H; Publishing Group, 1999, , p.78. On this basis, most historians estimate that Gallio (brother of Seneca the Younger) became proconsul between the spring of AD 51 and the summer of AD 52, and that his position ended no later than AD 53.The Cambridge Companion to St Paul by James D.

Jeffers 1999 pages 164‚Äì165The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Acts‚ÄìPhilemon by Craig A. Evans 2004 page 248 The trial of Paul is generally assumed to be in the earlier part of Gallio's tenure, based on the reference (Acts 18:2) to his meeting in Corinth with Priscilla and Aquila, who had been recently expelled from Rome based on Emperor Claudius' expulsion of Jews from Rome, which is dated to AD 49‚Äì50.The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament edition by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 page 405 According to the New Testament, Paul spent eighteen months in Corinth, approximately seventeen years after his conversion.Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible Amsterdam University Press, 2000 page 1019 Galatians 2:1‚Äì10 states that Paul went back to Jerusalem fourteen years after his conversion, and various missions (at times with Barnabas) such as those in Acts 11:25‚Äì26 and 2 Corinthians 11:23‚Äì33 appear in the Book of Acts. The generally accepted scholarly estimate for the date of conversion of Paul is AD 33‚Äì36, placing the death of Jesus before this date range. =Astronomical analysis= Newton's method Isaac Newton deduced a methodology to date the crucifixion. All four Gospels agree to within about a day that the crucifixion was at the time of Passover, and all four Gospels agree that Jesus died a few hours before the commencement of the Jewish Sabbath, i.e. he died before nightfall on a Friday (; ; ; ). In the official festival calendar of Judaea, as used by the priests of the temple, Passover time was specified precisely. The slaughtering of the lambs for Passover occurred between 3pm and 5pm on the 14th day of the Jewish month Nisan (corresponding to March/April). The Passover meal commenced at moonrise (necessarily a full moon) that evening, i.e., at the start of 15 Nisan (the Jewish day running from evening to evening) (; ). There is an apparent discrepancy of one day in the Gospel accounts of the crucifixion which has been the subject of considerable debate. In John's Gospel, it is stated that the day of Jesus' trial and execution was the day before Passover ( and ), Hence John places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan. Likewise the Apostle Paul, in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, implies Jesus died on a 14 Nisan (\\"sacrificed as a Passover lamb\\", ), and was resurrected on the Jewish festival of the first fruits, i.e. on a 16 Nisan ().Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , pages 68‚Äì69 The correct interpretation of the Synoptics is less clear. Thus some scholars believe that all 4 Gospels place the crucifixion on Friday, 14 Nisan, others believe that according to the Synoptics it occurred on Friday, 15 Nisan. The problem that then has to be solved is that of determining in which of the years of the reign of Pontius Pilate (AD 26‚Äì36) the 14th and 15th Nisan fell on a Friday. In a paper published posthumously in 1733, Isaac Newton considered only the range AD 31‚Äì36 and calculated that the Friday requirement is met only on Friday 3 April AD 33, and 23 April AD 34\\\\. The latter date can only have fallen on a Friday if an exceptional leap month had been introduced that year, but this was favoured by Newton.Newton, Isaac (1733). \\"Of the Times of the Birth and Passion of Christ\\", in Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John. Also at: In the twentieth century, the standard view became that of J. K. Fotheringham, who in 1910 suggested 3 April AD 33 on the basis of its coincidence with a lunar eclipse.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , pages 45‚Äì48Fotheringham, J.K., 1910. \\"On the smallest visible phase of the moon,\\" Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 70, 527‚Äì531; \\"Astronomical Evidence for the Date of the Crucifixion,\\" Journal of Theological Studies (1910) 12, 120‚Äì127'; \\"The Evidence of Astronomy and Technical Chronology for the Date of the Crucifixion,\\" Journal of Theological Studies (1934) 35, 146‚Äì162. In 1933, Ant√≥nio Cabreira, following a similar method, arrived at the same date, as did, in the 1990s, Bradley E. Schaefer and J. P. Pratt. Also according to Humphreys and Waddington, the lunar Jewish calendar leaves only two plausible dates within the reign of Pontius Pilate for Jesus' death, and both of these would have been a 14 Nisan as specified in the Gospel of John: Friday 7 April AD 30, and Friday 3 April AD 33\\\\. A more refined calculation takes into account that the Jewish calendar was based not on astronomical calculation but on observation, following criticism that it is possible to establish the phase of the moon on a particular day two thousand years ago but not whether it was obscured by clouds or haze.C. Philipp E. Nothaft, Dating the Passion: The Life of Jesus and the Emergence of Scientific Chronology (200‚Äì1600) page 25.E. P. Sanders, The Historical Figure of Jesus (Penguin, 1993) 285‚Äì286. Including the possibility of a cloudy sky obscuring the moon, and assuming that the Jewish authorities would be aware that lunar months can only be either 29 or 30 days long (the time from one new moon to the next is 29.53 days), then the refined calculation states that the Friday requirement might also have been met, during Pontius Pilate's term of office, on 11 April AD 27\\\\. Another potential date arises if the Jewish authorities happened to add an irregular lunar leap month to compensate for a meteorologically delayed harvest season: this would yield one additional possibility during Pilate's time, which is Newton's favoured date of 23 April AD 34.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , pages 53‚Äì58 Colin Humphreys calculates but rejects these AD 27 and AD 34 dates on the basis that the former is much too early to be compatible with , and spring AD 34 is probably too late to be compatible with Paul's timeline, confirming Friday 7 April AD 30, and Friday 3 April AD 33 as the two feasible crucifixion dates.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , pages 63‚Äì66 Eclipse method Lunar eclipse, 21 January 2019. Red hue caused by diffraction of sunlight through Earth's atmosphere. A lunar eclipse is potentially alluded to in Acts of the Apostles 2:14‚Äì21 (\\"The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of the Lord come\\"), as pointed out by physicist Colin Humphreys and astronomer Graeme Waddington. There was in fact a lunar eclipse on 3 April AD 33, a date which coincides with one of Newton's astronomically possible crucifixion dates (see above). Humphreys and Waddington have calculated that in ancient Jerusalem this eclipse would have been visible at moonrise at 6.20pm as a 20% partial eclipse (a full moon with a potentially red \\"bite\\" missing at the top left of the moon's disc). They propose that a large proportion of the Jewish population would have witnessed this eclipse as they would have been waiting for sunset in the west and immediately afterwards the rise of the anticipated full moon in the east as the prescribed signal to start their household Passover meals. Humphreys and Waddington therefore suggest a scenario where Jesus was crucified and died at 3pm on 3 April AD 33, followed by a red partial lunar eclipse at moonrise at 6.20pm observed by the Jewish population, and that Peter recalls this event when preaching the resurrection to the Jews (Acts of the Apostles 2:14‚Äì21). Astronomer Bradley Schaefer agrees with the eclipse date but disputes that the eclipsed moon would have been visible by the time the moon had risen in Jerusalem.Schaefer, B. E. (July 1991). Glare and celestial visibility. Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 103, 645‚Äì660.Marking time: the epic quest to invent the perfect calendar by Duncan Steel 1999 page 341 A potentially related issue involves the reference in the Synoptic Gospels to a three-hour period of darkness over the whole land on the day of the crucifixion (according to Luke 23:45 œÑŒø·ø¶ ·º°ŒªŒØŒøœÖ ·ºêŒ∫ŒªŒπœÄœåŒΩœÑŒøœÇ ‚Äì the sun was darkened). Although some scholars view this as a literary device common among ancient writers rather than a description of an actual event,David E. Garland, Reading Matthew: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the First Gospel (Smyth & Helwys Publishing, 1999) page 264. other writers have attempted to identify a meteorological event or a datable astronomical phenomenon which this could have referred to. It could not have been a solar eclipse, since this could not take place during the full moon at Passover,Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy by David H. Kelley, Eugene F. Milone 2011 pages 250‚Äì251Astronomy: The Solar System and Beyond by Michael A. Seeds, Dana Backman, 2009 page 34 and in any case solar eclipses take minutes, not hours.Meeus, J. (December 2003). The maximum possible duration of a total solar eclipse. Journal of the British Astronomical Association, 113(6), 343‚Äì348. In 1983, astronomers Humphreys and Waddington noted that the reference to a solar eclipse is missing in some versions of Luke and argued that the solar eclipse was a later faulty scribal amendment of what was actually the lunar eclipse of AD 33. This is a claim which historian David Henige describes as \\"undefended\\" and \\"indefensible\\". Humphreys and a number of scholars have alternatively argued for the sun's darkening to have been caused by a khamsin, i.e. a sand storm, which can occur between mid-March and May in the Middle East and which does typically last for several hours.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , page 84‚Äì85 In a review of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his lunar eclipse argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony, accepting uncritically statements such as the \\"three different Passovers in John\\" and Matthew's statement that Jesus died at the ninth hour. He also alleges that Humphreys uses two very dubious sources, namely Pilate's alleged letter to Tiberius and the writings of the fifth-century Bishop Cyril of Alexandria, which Humphreys however classifies as forgery or contemporary interpretation indicative of a tradition at the time.Humphreys 2011 p85 \\"Much apocryphal writing consists of highly theatrical literature, which cannot be used as historical evidence ... if [Pilate's report to Tertullian] is a Christian forgery, probably made up on the basis of Acts, as seems likely, then this suggests there was a tradition that at the crucifixion the moon appeared like blood.\\" Double Passover method The rising full moon at sunset signals the start of the Passover meal. This is two weeks after the new moon has heralded the start of the month of Nisan (March/April). In the crucifixion narrative, the synoptic gospels stress that Jesus celebrated a Passover meal (Mark 14:12ff, Luke 22:15) before his crucifixion, which contrasts sharply with the independent gospel of John who is explicit that the official \\"Jewish\\" Passover (John 11:55) started at nightfall after Jesus' death. In his 2011 book, Colin Humphreys proposes a resolution to this apparent discrepancy by positing that Jesus' \\"synoptic\\" Passover meal in fact took place two days before John's \\"Jewish\\" Passover because the former is calculated by the putative original Jewish lunar calendar (itself based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar putatively introduced to the Israelites by Moses in the 13th century BC, and still used today by the Samaritans). The official \\"Jewish\\" Passover in contrast was determined by a Jewish calendar reckoning which had been modified during the Babylonian exile in the 6th century BC. This modified Jewish calendar is in use among most Jews today. One basic difference lies in the determination of the first day of the new month: while the Samaritans use the calculated (because by definition invisible) new moon, mainstream Jews use the first observation of the thin crescent of the waxing moon which is on average 30 hours later. The other basic difference lies in the fact that the Samaritan calendar uses a sunrise-to-sunrise day, while the official Jewish calendar uses a sunset-to-sunset day. Due to these differences, the Samaritan Passover is normally one day earlier than the Jewish Passover (and in some years two or more days earlier). The crucifixion year of Jesus can then be calculated by asking the question in which of the two astronomically possible years of AD 30 and AD 33 is there a time gap between the last supper and the crucifixion which is compatible with the gospel timeline of Jesus' last 6 days. The astronomical calculations show that a hypothetical AD 30 date would require an incompatible Monday Last Supper, while AD 33 offers a compatible Last Supper on Wednesday, 1 April AD 33, followed by a compatible crucifixion on Friday, 3 April AD 33.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , page 164 Given these assumptions he argues that the calculated date of Wednesday 1 April AD 33 for the Last Supper allows all four gospel accounts to be astronomically correct, with Jesus celebrating Passover two days before his death according to the original Mosaic calendar, and the Jewish authorities celebrating Passover just after the crucifixion, using the modified Babylonian calendar. In contrast, the Christian church tradition of celebrating the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday would be an anachronism.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , page 37 The calculated chronology incidentally supports John's and Paul's narratives that Jesus died at the same hour (Friday 3pm) on 3 April AD 33 that the Passover lambs were slaughtered.Colin Humphreys, The Mystery of the Last Supper Cambridge University Press 2011 , page 192‚Äì195 In a review of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford counters that the separate day schema of the Gospel's Holy Week \\"is an artificial as well as an inconsistent construction\\". As Telford had pointed out in his own book in 1980,WR Telford The Barren Temple and the Withered Tree: A Redaction-Critical Analysis of the Cursing of the Fig-Tree Pericope in Mark's Gospel and its Relation to the Cleansing of the Temple Tradition Bloomsbury, London, 1980 \\"the initial three-day structure found in [Mark 11] is occasioned by the purely redactional linkage of the extraneous fig-tree story with the triumphal entry and cleansing of the temple traditions, and is not a chronology upon which one can base any historical reconstructions.\\" =Scholarly debate on the hour, day, and year of death= A Papyrus 90 fragment of John 19 The estimation of the hour of the death of Jesus based on the New Testament accounts has been the subject of debate among scholars for centuries. Some scholars have argued that it is unlikely that the many events of the Passion could have taken place in the span from midnight to about 9 o'clock in the morning.Eugen Ruckstuhl (1965), Chronology of The Last Days of Jesus ‚Äì A Critical Study [Trans. from German] (pp. 35‚Äì71 for ‚ÄòThe Chronology of ‚ÄúMore Than One Day‚Äù) The consensus of modern scholarship agrees with the four Gospels that the New Testament accounts represent a crucifixion occurring on a Friday, although a Wednesday crucifixion has also been proposed.The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J. K√∂stenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 pages 142‚Äì143New Testament History by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 pages 167‚Äì168 The debate on the date can be summarised as follows. In the Synoptic account, the Last Supper takes place on the first night of Passover, defined in the Torah as occurring after daylight on 14 of Nisan, and the crucifixion is on 15 Nisan. However, in the Gospel of John the trial of Jesus takes place before the Passover mealPaul Barnett, Jesus & the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times, page 21 (InterVarsity Press, 1999). and the sentencing takes place on the day of Preparation, before Passover. John's account places the crucifixion on 14 Nisan, since the law mandated the lamb had to be sacrificed between 3:00 pm and 5:00 pm and eaten before midnight on that day.Josephus. The War of the Jews 6.9.3Mishnah, Pesahim 5.1. It is problematic to reconcile the chronology presented by John with the Synoptic tradition that the Last Supper was a Passover meal.; ; Some scholars have presented arguments to reconcile the accounts, although Raymond E. Brown, reviewing these, concluded that they can not be easily reconciled.Death of the Messiah, Volume 2 by Raymond E. Brown 1999 pages 959‚Äì960 One involves the suggestion that for Jesus and his disciples, the Passover could have begun at dawn Thursday, while for traditional Jews it would not have begun until dusk that same day. Another is that John followed the Roman practice of calculating the new day beginning at midnight, rather than the Jewish reckoning.Brooke Foss Westcott, The Gospel according to St. John : the authorised version with introduction and notes (1881, page 282). However, this Roman practice was used only for dating contracts and leases.Hunt, Michal. The Passover Feast and Christ's Passion 1991, revised 2007. Agape Bible Study. Retrieved 17 January 2014.Leon Morris. The New International Commentary on the New Testament ‚Äì The Gospel According to John (Revised). William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, Grand Rapids, Michigan/Cambridge, U.K. 1995, pages 138 and 708. D. A. Carson argues that 'preparation of the Passover' could mean any day of the Passover week.D.A. Carson, 'The Gospel According to John', Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, 1991, p604 Some have argued that the modern precision of marking the time of day should not be read back into the gospel accounts, written at a time when no standardization of timepieces, or exact recording of hours and minutes was available.Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007 Harmony of the Gospels pages 323‚Äì323New Testament History by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 pages 173‚Äì174 Andreas K√∂stenberger argues that in the first century time was often estimated to the closest three-hour mark, and that the intention of the author of the Mark Gospel was to provide the setting for the three hours of darkness while the Gospel of John seeks to stress the length of the proceedings, starting in the 'early morning'\\"The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J. K√∂stenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 page 538 William Barclay has argued that the portrayal of the death of Jesus in the John Gospel is a literary construct, presenting the crucifixion as taking place at the time on the day of Passover when the sacrificial lamb would be killed, and thus portraying Jesus as the Lamb of God. This understanding fits with Old Testament typology, in which Jesus entered Jerusalem to identify himself as the Paschal lamb on Nisan 10 was crucified and died at 3:00 in the afternoon of Nisan 14, at the same time the High Priest would have sacrificed the Paschal lamb, and rose before dawn the morning of Nisan 16, as a type of offering of the First Fruits. Colin Humphreys' widely publicised \\"double passover\\" astronomical analysis, published in 2011 and outlined above, places the time of death of Jesus at 3pm on 3 April AD 33 and claims to reconcile the Gospel accounts for the \\"six days\\" leading up to the crucifixion. His solution is that the synoptic gospels and John's gospel use two distinct calendars (the official Jewish lunar calendar, and what is today the Samaritan lunar calendar, the latter used in Jesus' day also by the Essenes of Qumran and the Zealots). Humphrey's proposal was preceded in 1957 by the work of Annie JaubertLa date de la c√®ne, Gabalda, Paris who suggested that Jesus held his Last Supper at Passover time according to the Qumran solar calendar. Humphreys rejects Jaubert's conclusion by demonstrating that the Qumran solar reckoning would always place Jesus' Last Supper after the Jewish Passover, in contradiction to all four gospels. Instead, Humphreys points out that the Essene community at Qumran additionally used a lunar calendar, itself evidently based on the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar. Humphreys suggests that the reason why his two-calendar solution had not been discovered earlier is (a) widespread scholarly ignorance of the existence of the Egyptian liturgical lunar calendar (used alongside the well-known Egyptian administrative solar calendar, and presumably the basis for the 13th-century BC Jewish lunar calendar), and (b) the fact that the modern surviving small community of Samaritans did not reveal the calculations underlying their lunar calendar (preserving the Egyptian reckoning) to outsiders until the 1960s. In a review of Humphreys' book, theologian William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony. In doing so, Telford says, Humphreys has built an argument upon unsound premises which \\"does violence to the nature of the biblical texts, whose mixture of fact and fiction, tradition and redaction, history and myth all make the rigid application of the scientific tool of astronomy to their putative data a misconstrued enterprise.\\" Resurrection \\"on the third day\\" After the crucifixion, the Gospels report the discovery of Jesus' empty tomb, and subsequently the Gospels and Paul provide accounts of Jesus' resurrection. A potential chronological contradiction arises in the fact that the resurrection is referred to as happening \\"on the third day\\" (e.g. Matt 16:21) whereas elsewhere Matthew (Matt 12:40) states that Jesus would be buried \\"three days and three nights\\".Norman Geisler and Thomas Howe, When Critics Ask: A Popular Handbook on Bible Difficulties Wheaton, Illinois, USA: Victor Books, 1992 The modern concept of zero as a number was introduced by Indian scholars only in the fifth century AD, so that for example the Gregorian calendar never had a year \\"AD 0\\" and instead begins with the year AD 1 which is immediately preceded by 1 BC. Applied to the reckoning of days, in the absence of a day \\"zero\\", that is, using inclusive counting, many modern languages (e.g. Greek, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Welsh) continue referring to two weeks as \\"fifteen days\\",James Evans, The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy. Oxford University Press, 1998. . Chapter 4, page 164. whereas in English, which does observe zero and thus uses exclusive counting, this space of time is referred to as a fortnight. Following general practice at the time, the Gospels employ inclusive counting, highlighted in Mt 27.62‚Äì64: where Matthew uses \\"after three days\\" and \\"until the third day\\" interchangeably. Ancient estimates Other estimates of the chronology of Jesus have been proposed over the centuries. Hippolytus, around AD 200, dates his birth as on Wednesday the eighth day to the Kalends of January (25 December) in the 42nd year of Caesar Augustus. Book 4, Paragraph 23.3. This may refer to 3 BC (see below), in which 25 December was indeed a Wednesday. He dates the crucifixion to the 33rd year of the life of Christ, on Friday 25 March of the 18th year of Tiberius. The reign of Tiberius began in AD 14, but 25 March never fell on a Friday between AD 30 and AD 34 inclusively. Eusebius, in his work Historia Ecclesiae first published in AD 313, placed the birth of Jesus in the forty-second year of Augustus' reign, and the twenty-eighth after the subjugation of Egypt and the deaths of Antony & Cleopatra, i.e. in 3 BC.Eusebius, AD 313, Historia Ecclesiae, I.5.2 The 3rd/4th century Roman historian Lactantius states that Jesus was crucified on 23 March AD 29.Lactantius, Of the Manner In Which the Persecutors Died 2: \\"In the latter days of the Emperor Tiberius, in the consulship of Ruberius (sic) Geminus and Fufius Geminus, and on the tenth of the kalends of April, as I find it written\\". Maximus the Confessor and Cassiodorus asserted that the death of Jesus occurred in AD 31\\\\. In AD 525 Dionysius Exiguus devised an Easter table to calculate the dates of Easter at a time when Julian calendar years were still being identified by naming the consuls who held office that year ‚Äî Dionysius himself stated that the \\"present year\\" was \\"the consulship of Probus Junior\\", which was 525 years \\"since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ\\".Nineteen year cycle of Dionysius Introduction and First Argumentum. Thus Dionysius implied that Jesus' incarnation occurred 525 years earlier. Bonnie J. Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the Nativity or incarnation. Among the sources of confusion are: * In modern times, incarnation is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as Bede, considered incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity. * The civil or consular year began on 1 January but the Diocletian year began on 29 August (30 August in the year before a Julian leap year). * There were inaccuracies in the lists of consuls. * There were confused summations of emperors' regnal years. It is not known how Dionysius established the year of Jesus's birth. Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was \\"about thirty years old\\" shortly after \\"the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar\\", and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table.T√∏ndering, Claus, The Calendar FAQ: Counting years The Anglo-Saxon historian the Venerable Bede, who was familiar with the work of Dionysius, used Anno Domini dating in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People, completed in AD 731. Both Dionysius and Bede regarded Anno Domini as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus, but \\"the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation was identified with Christ's conception, i.e., the Annunciation on March 25\\". On the continent of Europe, Anno Domini was introduced as the calendrical system of choice of the Carolingian Renaissance by the English cleric and scholar Alcuin in the late eighth century. Its endorsement by Emperor Charlemagne and his successors popularizing this calendar throughout the Carolingian Empire ultimately lies at the core of the calendar's global prevalence today.

He is called a heresiarch, leader of a heretical movement, by the Roman Catholic Church because he opposed infant baptism, the erecting of churches and the veneration of crosses, the doctrine of transubstantiation and prayers for the dead. An angry Roman Catholic mob killed him in or around 1131. Information on Peter of Bruys is derived from two extant sources, the treatise of Peter the Venerable against his followers and a passage written by Peter Abelard. Life and teachings Sources suggest that Peter was born at Bruis, in southeastern France. The history of his early life is unknown, but he was a Roman Catholic priest who had been deprived of his office by the Church hierarchy for teaching unorthodox doctrine. He began his preaching in Dauphin√© and Provence, probably between 1117 and 1120. The local bishops, who oversaw the dioceses of Embrun, Die, and Gap, suppressed his teachings within their jurisdictions. In spite of the official repression, Peter's teachings gained adherents at Narbonne, Toulouse and in Gascony. Peter admitted the doctrinal authority of the Gospels in their literal interpretation but considered the other New Testament writings to be valueless, as he doubted their apostolic origin. He questioned the Old Testament and rejected the authority of the Church Fathers and that of the Roman Catholic Church itself. Petrobrusians also opposed clerical celibacy, infant baptism, prayers for the deadRussell, Jeffrey Burton. Dissent and Reform in the Early Middle Ages, Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2005 and organ music.Bredero, Adriaan H., Christendom and Christianity in the Middle Ages, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1994 Treatise of Peter the Venerable In the preface to his treatise that attacked Peter of Bruys, Peter the Venerable summed up the five teachings that he saw as the errors of the Petrobrusians. Also known as Peter of Montboissier, he was an abbot and an important religious writer who became a popular figure in the church, an internationally-known scholar and an associate of many national and religious leaders of his day. Both Peter the Venerable and Peter Abelard (pictured) attacked the teachings of Peter of Bruys. The first \\"error\\" was their denial \\"that children, before the age of understanding, can be saved by the baptism... According to the Petrobrusians, not another's, but one's own faith, together with baptism, saves, as the Lord says, 'He who will believe and be baptized will be saved, but he who will not believe will be condemned.'\\" That idea ran counter to the medieval Church's teaching, particularly in the Latin West, following the theology of Augustine, in which the baptism of infants and children played an essential role in their salvation from the ancestral guilt of original sin.can. 849, CIC 1983Augustine's mother, Monica, did not have him baptized as an infant. Rather, he received baptism from his mentor, Ambrose of Milan. The second error charged (with some exaggeration) was that the Petrobrusians said, \\"Edifices for temples and churches should not be erected... The Petrobrusians are quoted as saying, 'It is unnecessary to build temples, since the church of God does not consist in a multitude of stones joined together, but in the unity of the believers assembled.'\\" On the other hand, the medieval Church taught that cathedrals and churches were created to glorify God and believed it to be appropriate that those buildings should be as grand and beautiful as wealth and skill could make them. Swaan, Wim. Art and Architecture of the Late Middle Ages, Omega Books, The third error enumerated by Peter the Venerable was that the Petrobrusians \\"command the sacred crosses to be broken in pieces and burned, because that form or instrument by which Christ was so dreadfully tortured, so cruelly slain, is not worthy of any adoration, or veneration or supplication, but for the avenging of his torments and death it should be treated with unseemly dishonor, cut in pieces with swords, burnt in fire.\\" That was seen as an iconoclastic heresy and as acts of sacrilege by the medieval Church and still is by Catholics today. The fourth error, according to Peter the Venerable, was that the Petrobrusians denied sacramental grace, rejecting the rite of Communion entirely, let alone the doctrine of the Real Presence or the nascent Scholastic account of transubstantiation: \\"They deny, not only the truth of the body and blood of the Lord, daily and constantly offered in the church through the sacrament, but declare that it is nothing at all, and ought not to be offered to God. They say, 'Oh, people, do not believe the bishops, priests, or clergy who seduce you; who, as in many things, so in the office of the altar, deceive you when they falsely profess to make the body of Christ and give it to you for the salvation of your souls.'\\" The term, transubstantiation, used to describe the transformation of the consecrated bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, was first used by Hildebert de Lavardin in about 1079.Sermones xciii; PL CLXXI, 776 The theory had long been widely accepted as orthodox doctrine at the time of the attacks by Peter of Bruys. Less than two centuries later, in 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council officially declared transubstantiation the necessary, orthodox Catholic explanation of the Eucharist. The fifth error was that \\"they deride sacrifices, prayers, alms, and other good works by the faithful living for the faithful dead, and say that these things cannot aid any of the dead even in the least... The good deeds of the living cannot profit the dead, because transferred from this life their merits cannot be increased or diminished, because beyond this life, there is no longer place for merits, only for retribution. Nor can a dead man hope to gain from anybody that which he did not obtain while alive in the world. Therefore those things are pointless that are done by the living for the dead, because they are mortal and have passed by death beyond the way for all flesh, into the state of the future world, and took with them all their merit, to which nothing can be added.\\" Death and legacy As Peter the Venerable recorded, crosses were singled out for special iconoclasm. Peter of Bruys felt that crosses should not deserve veneration. Crosses became for the Petrobrusians objects of desecration and were destroyed in bonfires. In or around the year 1126, Peter was publicly burning crosses in St Gilles, near N√Æmes. The local Roman Catholic populace, angered by Peter's destruction of the crosses, cast him into the flames of his own bonfire. Bernard of Clairvaux preached for a return to Roman orthodoxy. Henry of Lausanne, a former Cluniac monk, adopted the Petrobrusians' teachings about 1135 and spread them in a modified form after Peter's death. His teachings continued to be frequently condemned by the Roman Catholic Church, meriting mention at the Second Lateran Council in 1139. Henry of Lausanne's followers became known as Henricians. Both the Henrician and the Petrobrusian sects began to die out in 1145, the year St Bernard of Clairvaux began preaching for a return to Roman orthodoxy in southern France. In a letter to the people of Toulouse, written at the end of 1146, Bernard calls upon them to extirpate the last remnants of the heresy. As late as 1151, however, some Henricians still remained active in Languedoc. In that year, the Benedictine monk and English chronicler Matthew Paris related that a young girl who claimed to be miraculously inspired by the Virgin Mary was reputed to have converted a great number of the disciples of Henry of Lausanne. The sects both disappear from the historical record after that reference. There is no evidence that Peter Waldo or any other later religious figures were directly influenced by Peter of Bruys.Mennonite Encyclopedia, Vol. 4, pp. 874‚Äì876 His low view of the Old Testament and the New Testament epistles was not shared by later Protestant figures such as Martin Luther or John Smyth. However, Peter is considered a prophet of the Protestant Reformation by some evangelical Protestants and Anabaptists.

Lalitpur District, part of the United Provinces, split the Central India Agency into eastern and western portions. The Central India Agency was created in 1854, by amalgamating the Western Malwa Agency with other smaller political offices which formerly reported to the Governor-General of India. The agency was overseen by a political agent who maintained British relations with the princely states and influence over them on behalf of the Governor-General. The headquarters of the agent were at Indore.  History  British hegemony over the states of Central India began in 1802, when several states in the Bundelkhand and Bagelkhand regions came under British control at the conclusion of the Treaty of Bassein between the British and the Maratha - Peshwa Bajirao II. British control of Bundelkhand expanded at the conclusion of the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1805. The remaining states, including Gwalior, Indore, Bhopal and a number of smaller states in the regions of Malwa, Nimar, and Bundelkhand, came under British control with the end of the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1818. The estate of Chanderi was ceded to the Sindhia ruler of Gwalior in 1844 by the British, and Jhansi State was seized by the British in 1853 under the doctrine of lapse was added to the United Provinces. In 1921 Gwalior Residency was separated from the Central India Agency, and in 1933 the state of Makrai transferred to Central India from the Central Provinces and Berar.  Princely States  The princely states in the area of the agency, 148 in all, varied in status and greatly in size. * Eleven states held treaty relations directly with the British Government, and were known as the treaty states: Gwalior State, Indore State, Bhopal State, Dhar State, Dewas Senior and Dewas Junior, Jaora, Orchha, Datia, Samthar and Rewa. * The 31 sanad states had direct relations with the British Government, but not by treaty. These states, in Bundelkhand and Bagelkhand, were granted deeds (sanads) confirming rulers in possession of their states, in return for the rulers signing a written bond of allegiance (ikrarnama) to the British. * The remaining smaller states and estates were known as mediatized or guaranteed states. ** Mediatized states were under the authority of a larger state, with the relationship between the states arranged through British mediation. ** Guaranteed states, found only in Malwa, were states under the authority of larger states, in which the British guaranteed whatever rights existed at the time of British occupation of the region at the conclusion of the Pindari War. The princely states were closely related to one of several political officers, which were rearranged a number of times in the history of the agency. Upon the British withdrawal from India in 1947, the political offices consisted of Indore Residency and the Bundelkhand, Bhopal and Malwa Agencies. = Bundelkhand Agency = : Bundelkhand Agency was bounded by Bagelkhand to the east, the United Provinces to the north, Lalitpur District to the west, and the Central Provinces to the south.

In 1956, the states of Vindhya Pradesh, Madhya Bharat, and Bhopal were merged into Madhya Pradesh. Later another state, Chhattisgarh, was formed from the area that was formerly Madhya Pradesh.

Overview  The PMI serves more than 2.9 million professionals including over 600,000 members in 214 countries and territories around the world, with 300 chapters and 10,000 volunteers serving local members in over 80 countries. Its services include the development of standards, research, education, publication, networking-opportunities in local chapters, hosting conferences and training seminars, and providing accreditation in project management. PMI has recruited volunteers to create industry standards, such as \\"A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge\\", which has been recognized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). In 2012 ISO adapted the project management processes from the PMBOK Guide 4th edition.  History  In the 1960s project management as such began to be used in the US aerospace, construction and defense industries.Patrick L. Healy (1997) Project Management: Getting the Job Done on Time and in Budget. The Project Management Institute was founded by Ned Engman (McDonnel Douglas Automation), James Snyder and Susan Gallagher (SmithKline & French Laboratories), Eric Jenett (Brown & Root) and J Gordon Davis (Georgia Institute of Technology) at the Georgia Institute of TechnologyMichele Sliger and Stacia Broderick (2008).

Engman, and Susan C. Gallagher. in 1969 as a nonprofit organization. It was incorporated in the state of Pennsylvania in the same year. PMI described its objectives in 1975 as to \\"foster recognition of the need for professionalism in project management; provide a forum for the free exchange of project management problems, solutions and applications; coordinate industrial and academic research efforts; develop common terminology and techniques to improve communications; provide interface between users and suppliers of hardware and software systems; and to provide guidelines for instruction and career development in the field of project management.\\"Sophie J. Chumas & Joan E. Hartman (1975) Directory of United States standardization activities NBS Special Publication 417. p. 141 In the 1970s standardization efforts represented 10 to 15 percent of the institute's efforts. The functions were performed through the Professional Liaison Committee which called on and coordinated with the Technology, Research Policy and Education Committees. The institute participated in national activities through the American National Standards Committee XK 36.3 and internationally, through liaison with an appointed observer to Europe's International Project Management Association, by then called INTERNET. PMI did not deal with the US Federal Government directly; a number of members were federal employees in agencies involved with project management. In the 1980s, efforts were made to standardize project management procedures and approaches. The PMI produced the first Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) in 1996. In the late 1990s Virgil R. Carter became president of the PMI. \\"ASME names new executive director\\" in: ASME news, May 2002. In 2002 Carter was succeeded by Gregory Balestrero, who directed the institute into the next decade. The number of members tripled again to 260,000 members from 150 countries in 2008.\\"NASA Project Management Challenge 2007\\" at pmchallenge.gsfc.nasa.gov. Accessed December 2, 2008. As of 2019, the president is Sunil Prashara.  Credentialing and certification  Launched in 1984, PMI's first credential was the PMP. It has since become a de facto standard certification, along with the PRINCE2 certification, in project management. In 2007 it earned the ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 accreditation from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). over 1 million people held the PMP credential. PMI later introduced many other credentials and a certification. Credential holders do not have to be members of PMI. To initially obtain a PMI credential, candidates must first document that they have met required education and experience requirements. They must then pass an examination consisting of multiple choice questions. To maintain most PMI credentials, holders must earn Professional Development Units (PDUs), which can be earned in a variety of ways such as taking classes, attending PMI global congresses, contributing to professional research or writing and publishing papers on the subject. Most credentials must be renewed every three years. These are the certifications and credentials offered by PMI:) Credentials: * Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) * Project Management Professional (PMP) * Program Management Professional (PgMP) * Portfolio Management Professional (PfMP) * PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP) * PMI Risk Management Professional (PMI-RMP) * PMI Scheduling Professional (PMI-SP) * PMI Professional in Business Analysis (PMI-PBA) Certification: * PMI Certified OPM3 Professional  Standards  The standards PMI develop and publish fall into three main categories: * Foundational Standards * Practice Standards and Frameworks * PMI Standards Extensions Here is a list of the standards belonging to each category: Foundational Standards * A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) ‚Äì Sixth Edition (2017).

The French word gr√®ve refers to a flat area covered with gravel or sand situated on the shores or banks of a body of water. The location presently occupied by the square was the point on the sandy right bank of the river Seine where the first riverine harbor of Paris was established. The Place de Gr√®ve Later it was used as a public meeting-place and also as a location where unemployed people gathered to seek work. This circumstance accounts for the current French expressions, √™tre en gr√®ve (to be on strike) and faire (la) gr√®ve (to go on strike). In 1243 Louis IX of France ordered 24 cartloads of Talmud manuscripts to be burned at the square. The principal reason why the Place de Gr√®ve is remembered is that it was the site of most of the public executions in early Paris. The gallows and the pillory stood there. The highest-profile executions took place on the gr√®ve, including the gruesome deaths of the assassins Fran√ßois Ravaillac and Robert-Fran√ßois Damiens, as well as the bandit-rebel Guy √âder de La Fontenelle. In 1310 the Place de Gr√®ve was also the site of the execution of the Beguine heretic Marguerite Porete. On 22 February 1680, the famous French fortune teller, poisoner and alleged sorceress La Voisin was burned to death in the square. During the French Revolution, the Place de Gr√®ve saw the first use of the guillotine, when robber Nicolas Jacques Pelletier was decapitated on 25 April 1792. Other notable executions included Charlotte Corday, Jean-Baptiste Carrier, and Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville. Location The southern end of the Place de l'H√¥tel de Ville, the end closer to the river, is on the right-bank side of the Pont d'Arcole, which crosses eighty metres of water to reach the island, √éle de la Cit√©, in the middle of the Seine. At this point on the riverbank, the Place de l'H√¥tel de Ville is formed by the convergence of three streets: two quays on the river, Quai de l'H√¥tel de Ville, and Quai de Gesvres, and the rue de Renard. The rue de Renard, which passes in front of the Paris city hall, the H√¥tel de Ville de Paris, forfeits its name for one city block, adopting instead \\"Place de l'H√¥tel de Ville\\" addresses. Metro station The Place de l'H√¥tel de Ville is served by the H√¥tel de Ville station of the Paris M√©tro, on lines 1 and 11.

He taught music theory at the Berne Conservatory and the Z√ºrich Conservatory. His works include an opera, oratorios, cantatas, and many instrumental genres from piano pieces to symphonies.  Life  Burkhard was born in Evilard, Canton of Bern. He attended and graduated from a teachers' training college . He also study with Ernst Graf, organist at the Berner M√ºnster. He moved to Leipzig to study piano with Robert Teichm√ºller and composition with Sigfrid Karg-Elert. After Leipzig, he moved on to Munich to study with Walter Courvoisier and later to Paris to work with Max d'Ollone. From 1924, he began teaching composition, theory and the piano in Berne. He was appointed professor at the in 1928. He conducted several choirs and small orchestras there. In 1932 he was struck with tuberculosis, and was compelled to live for several years in Montana and Davos. During that time, he turned more towards composition. He settled in Z√ºrich in 1942 and taught composition and music theory at the Z√ºrich Conservatory, where his students included Klaus Huber, Rudolf Kelterborn, Ernst Pfiffner, Armin Schibler and . In 1950 he received a prize from the Schweizerischer Tonk√ºnstlerverein (Swiss Association of Musicians). He died in Z√ºrich in 1955 at the age of 55.  Work  Burkhard published 98 works with Opus numbers, and left a large amount of unpublished works held as manuscripts by the . He began to compose in late-Romantic style. His personal style developed from 1930, comparable to Paul Hindemith and Frank Martin. Late in life, he used some features of twelve-tone composition, but remained within tonality. He was interested to compose for voices, and regarded for renovated sacred music. Burkhard is known for sacred choral music, including oratorios Das Gesicht Jesajas (Isaiah's vision) and Das Jahr (The year), and the cantata Die Sintflut (The Flood). He composed an opera, Die Schwarze Spinne based on Gotthelf's novella The Black Spider. He wrote song settings for solo voice and choirs, chamber music and piano works. His orchestral music was often dedicated to Paul Sacher's Sinfonietta, including a Violin Concerto, and two symphonies. = Dramatic works = * Im Zeichen des Kreuzes, incidental music, 1938‚Äì9 * Laupenspiel, Op. 56, radio score, 1939 * Oedipus rex, Op. 72, incidental music to Oedipus Rex by Sophocles, speaking choruses, wind instruments, timpani, 1944 * Die schwarze Spinne, text by R.

It was replaced in Japan by the Toyota Premio, It was replaced in Europe by the Toyota Avensis and it was replaced in Asia-Pacific/Americas by the Toyota Camry. It was related to Toyota Mark II and Toyota Carina. Traditionally, the competitor from Datsun/Nissan was the Datsun/Nissan Bluebird. The word \\"corona\\" is Latin for \\"crown\\", a reference to an earlier vehicle Toyota offered called the Toyota Crown. It was exclusive to Toyopet Store dealership channels in Japan, while the larger Crown was available only at Toyota Store locations. In many countries, the Corona was one of Toyota's first international export models, and was shortly joined by the smaller Toyota Corolla, providing buyers with a choice of a larger car, with similar operating expenses to the smaller Corolla. The Corona was Toyota's second sedan in their hierarchy of products, just below the Crown, until 1968 when the Corona name was used on a larger, all new platform called the Toyota Corona Mark II, which gave buyers more interior space while still offering dependable, affordable performance. The Corona became successful in export markets and was marketed under a number of different nameplates worldwide‚Äîincluding those branded in much of Asia as Coronas marketed in European markets as Carinas. __TOC__  First generation (T10; 1957)  The first-generation Corona, introduced in May 1957 and became available on the market two months later, was designed with parts from the previous-generation Crown and Master following a major restyle and enlargement of the Crown. The design of many of the body panels were cut down from the Master which had ceased production. Aside from the 4-door T10 sedan, the T16V 3-door van version was introduced in October 1958 as Toyopet Coronaline. Originally, the T10/16 Corona was fitted with the old sidevalve \\"S\\" engine, with . In April 1958 the Corona underwent a light facelift, with a new hood ornament and door handles. The tail light design of this generation is reminiscent of the 1949 Ford sedan. The OHV P series engine replaced the old S in October 1959, and offered substantially more power with at 5,000 rpm. The P-engined Corona sedan was capable of traveling at , higher than the old S-engined model. The car also underwent another facelift, including a mesh grille and a new rear seat which allowed seating for five rather than the previous four. As regulations regarding taxis at the time required engines no larger than , dealers restricted the power for taxi vehicles. Due to the upgrade in dimensions of the Crown, Toyota needed to continue manufacturing a vehicle with similar size dimensions to the first Crown, primarily to be used for taxi usage. This vehicle was also the first Toyota's car with a monocoque chassis structure, and an independent front suspension using double wishbones. Due to the monocoque chassis, Toyota was able to produce a vehicle under . Rear view of 1957 Corona (ST10)  Second generation (T20, T30; 1960)  This generation of the Corona was also known as the Tiara (in keeping with the crown naming convention) when exported by Toyota Motor Corporation. It was introduced at a critical time for the company in North America. Their first flagship car, the Toyopet Crown, was unsuccessful in the US market, and the Corona was added to offer a choice along with the Land Cruiser. At the time, there was little market for an off-road vehicle like the Land Cruiser. The front mask of the T20 Corona is reminiscent of the 1955‚Äì1957 Ford Thunderbird, and shares its appearance with the entry-level offering, called the Toyota Publica. The Tiara was introduced to sell alongside the Crown, as a smaller companion. Introduced in March 1960, the car was powered by a 1.0 L \\"P\\" series motor. With a three- speed manual transmission, top speed was a mere . In March 1961, Toyota introduced a more powerful 1.5-litre \\"R\\" series motor, the same motor from the Crown, and an even larger 1.9-litre engine was added in 1964. Fortunately for Toyota, the problems with the Crown were not seen on the Tiara as the lighter body ( less than the Crown) made the R series engine more sufficient. The Tiara station wagon was seemingly aimed at women, with many of the original brochures featuring only women in a dinner dress as well as playing golf. Nevertheless, it sold better than the Crown and had a lot fewer mechanical problems. The Tiara ended up being the only sedan sold by Toyota in the US until the reworked second-generation Crown appeared. By that time, the Tiara had been redesigned and given the Corona label from the Japanese domestic market. A total of only 318 of these vehicles were sold in the US. In Australia the Tiara was produced in Port Melbourne, Victoria by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) starting from 1963. Two concept cars were shown at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show ‚Äì the Corona 1500S Convertible and the Corona 1900S Sporty Sedan. The Corona Sports Coupe was a concept car shown at the 1963 Tokyo Motor Show ‚Äì it shared little with the Corona except the suspension and the name. The load carrying variants, Coronaline van and pickup (technically a coup√© utility) were introduced in July and September 1960 with rigid axle semi-oval leaf spring rear suspension and 500 kg payload capacity, to fill commercial segment below the heavier capacity Toyota Stout.  Third generation (T40, T50; 1964)  The third generation was introduced September 1964, one month before the 1964 Summer Olympics. It was available in sedan, two-door hardtop, three-door van, five-door station wagon (also as a van), two coup√© utility variants and a five-door hatchback. Italian designer Battista Farina assisted in the styling of the new Corona. The 40‚Äì43 series were reserved for sedans, while commercial vehicles (and wagons) were in the 46 and 47 series. Hardtops received 50‚Äì55 series model codes, while 56 was reserved for the five-door hatchback. The 1965 model marked a return of Toyota to the American market after withdrawing there temporarily in 1961. A public demonstration of the new Corona's performance was done on the Meishin Expressway, where the new model was tested to , and was able to sustain speeds of . The Corona was released one year after the debut of the Corona's traditional competitor, the Nissan Bluebird. Toyota introduced a smaller vehicle to address the market that needed a more fuel efficient vehicle, called the Toyota Corolla in November 1966. This allowed the Corona to increase in size and offer more passenger and cargo room over previous generations. time was 15.1 seconds. Originally, commercial models (three-door van, coup√© utility, and double-cab coup√© utility) utilized the 1,198 cc 2P engine, with at 5,000 rpm. This allowed for a maximum load of for the two- seater versions and for the five-seaters. Heavier loads were better accommodated by the Toyota Stout, while larger commercial grade trucks became available at Toyota Diesel Store locations. 1967 also saw the debut of a cab over van equipped for both commercial and commuting duties using the Corona engines, called the Toyota HiAce, offering more payload than the Corona was suited for. The coup√© utility was produced by the former Central Motors between October 1964 and August 1968. In July 1965 the 2-door hardtop coup√© bodystyle was introduced. Top speed for the 1.2-litre Corona is . In January 1967 this also became available as a five-door van. In April 1967, the larger and more powerful 3P (1.35-litre) and 2R (1.5-litre) engines became available, replacing the lesser 2P in most markets. Power of these were respectively. The Toyota automatic transmission, marketed as Toyoglide, was introduced on this version of the Corona. The 4R (12R in Australian versions) engine that had a displacement of 1587 cc was equipped with a twin SU carburetor (Australian models with 12R engine had one double barrel Aisin downdraft carburetor), and was capable of . Disc brakes were also introduced for the front wheels. Exports of this Corona proved popular in the US and Europe, with increased engine performance and durability improvements over previous versions. In September 1967 alone, Toyota produced 80,000 cars, with 30,000 being Coronas. =Toyota 1600GT (RT55)= In July 1965 Toyota introduced Japan's first 2-door hardtop coup√©, and August 1967 they installed the DOHC 9R engine in the RT55 1600GT. This engine used the 4R engine block borrowed from the Corona 1600S with a Yamaha built DOHC head derived from the 2.0 L 3M engine in the exotic 2000GT that was introduced May 1967, and produced 110 bhp. The 1600GT was offered as a more affordable junior version of the larger, more exclusive 2000GT, and 2,222 examples of the 1600GT were manufactured in Bellatrix Yellow, Pegasus White, Solar Red, and Thunder Silver metallic. These were all colors that were offered on the 2000GT, while the appearance shows several similarities to the 1965 Ford Mustang.„Éá„Ç¢„Ç¥„Çπ„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éº„Éã„Ç∏„É£„Éë„É≥ ÈÄ±ÂàäÊó•Êú¨„ÅÆÂêçËªäÁ¨¨5Âè∑23„Éö„Éº„Ç∏„Çà„Çä„ÄÇ Two manual transmissions were offered, a console housing a floor mounted 4-speed or optional 5-speed, and due to its sporting nature, no automatic transmission was offered. The interior only came in black, with reclining front bucket seats. The steering wheel matched the one used in the 2000GT, but the outer rim was wood grained plastic. It was Toyota's answer to the Isuzu Bellet GT, the Nissan Bluebird SSS and the Prince Skyline 2000GTB. While it used the Corona hardtop coup√© body, it was not known as the Corona 1600GT, sharing a naming convention to the larger 2000GT. It inspired the Crown hardtop coup√© in October 1968, the Corona Mark II GSS in 1970, the Celica GT, the Carina GT and the Toyota Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno later in 1972, while a 2.0 liter DOHC engine continued to be offered in subsequent Corona GT coup√©s until 1983. On the front fenders, grilles were installed, and the inverted triangle found on the grille of the 2000GT is also installed on the 1600GT's grille. = Foreign assembly = The Corona was the first Toyota assembled in New Zealand, from February 1967 at Steel Brothers' Motor Assemblies in Christchurch. It was also built by Shinjin Motor in South Korea from 1966 until 1972. Shinjin Motor was a predecessor to Daewoo and soon switched to assembling General Motors products. The Corona was also assembled by Australian Motor Industries in Melbourne, with the 12R engine. South African assemblies commenced in 1966, with the car reaching a fifteenth position on the 1967 sales charts. = Corona Mark II (T60, T70; 1968) = 1968 Corona Mark II September 1968 saw the release of a larger model called the Corona Mark II. It was a slightly larger vehicle than the Corona with a higher level of equipment offered at the time, sharing some of the features of the larger Crown, but taking the top position at Toyopet Store locations. The Corona Mark II is longer, at over the Corona's length of for the sedan, and the coupe, with a width of in comparison to for the sedan and coupe. The height of the Mark II is lower at over for the sedan, but higher at for the coup√©. After 1972, this was spun off as a separate platform, eventually dispensing with the \\"Corona\\" part of the name.  Fourth generation (T80, T90; 1970)  The T80 series Corona was introduced February 1970 and was a complete redesign, and was developed on a separate platform from the Toyota Corona Mark II, which became a larger, more comfortable and powerful car, where the Corona remained focused on fuel economy. Body styles were further reduced to a two-door hardtop coup√©, a four-door sedan and station wagon. The engine continued to use an OHV on base level vehicles, and SOHC on better equipped versions and most of the two-door coup√©s. The engines used in the Mark II were often shared with the Corona. Trim levels originally offered were the 1500 standard or DX, 1600 DX, and the 1600 SL (although the 1900 cc 8R engine was offered in North America and South Africa). The 1.5 offered , while the 1.6 has depending on the spec. A slight change occurred in January 1971, when the 2R and 7R engines (RT80/82/86V) were replaced by the more powerful 12R and 6R units (RT81/84/87V). At the same time, the larger 1.9-litre RT83 was added to the lineup. A plethora of transmissions were offered, with a three-speed manual as standard. A four-speed manual with a floor-mounted lever was also available, as were two- or three-speed \\"Toyoglide\\" automatic transmissions, with the three-speed available with a floor-mounted shifter. Later on a five-speed manual was also made available in the sportier versions. The Corona was redesigned in August 1971, with the low- mounted wraparound turn signals removed and a new grille. Another, milder yet restyle appeared in August 1972, including new grilles and hubcaps. The Hardtop gained a two-litre engine at this time. Among the mechanical updates were electronic fuel injection installed on the 18R-E with a SOHC engine design that appeared in the two-door coup√©. The 18R-B had twin SU Carburetors, with an electronically controlled automatic transmission, labeled ECT. Four- cylinder engine choices were pushrod 1.35 (van Standard only), 1.5, and 1.6-litre engines, and overhead-cam 1.7, 1.9, and 2.0-litre gasoline units. Vans (wagons) were sold with 1.35 3P or 1.5-litre 2R engines for the first year, but the 1.5 was replaced by the 1.6-litre 12R engine in January 1971. The 1.7-litre 6R engine was added to the lineup in September 1970, and became available in the van in September 1971. North America only received the Corona wagon in July 1972 (and only for the 1973 model year), as the two-litre RT89. A performance oriented in-house competitor called the Toyota Carina, close in size to the Corona and based on the Toyota Celica platform, was introduced in 1970. It was available at a different dealership sales channel called Toyota Store. This generation of Corona was available at dealerships called Toyopet Store. The Corona pick-up was no longer manufactured due to the introduction of the Hilux in 1969. Along with the August 1972 facelift, the Corona received the 2.0-litre engine which appeared in the 2000SL and the 2000SR with fuel injection. The 7R-engined RT82 was short-lived in Japan, only being available between February and September 1970, but in other markets it may have remained available until the introduction of the next Corona. In the United States, the 1970s were probably the Corona's high point, helped by the fuel crises of 1973 and 1979. Competition for sales continued from the Nissan Bluebird, and from a new competitor from the Mazda RX-2 in 1971, with an introduction to the US in 1972. As with the prior generation models offered were limited to the four- door sedan and the hardtop coupe for most of the run, with the wagon added only for 1973, the final model year of the generation. These models were assembled in New Zealand (by Steel's) and Australia (Australian Motor Industries or AMI). NZ models initially had a 1.5-litre OHV engine and four- speed manual and then the 6R 1.7-litre OHC engine. After the first facelift (new nose and tail, square instead of round instrument housings) for 1972, the 6R engine was again used. The 1972 facelift (another new grille) saw two models ‚Äì 1.6-litre OHV with three-speed column-shift manual and bench front seat and 1.7-litre four-speed floor shift manual and high-back buckets. This version was badged 1700SE. Australian RT81s used the 1.6-litre OHV engine and four-speed manual. Local content was much higher than the NZ cars with local instruments and heater which meant, surprisingly for the climate, there were no centre air vents. The facelift AMI assembled model with the revised grille was released in November 1972, lasting to March 1974. A modified Corona was shown at the 1970 Tokyo Motor Show as the Electronics Car. Based on the Corona Hardtop 1700SL, it showed many electronic innovations but was not put into production.  Fifth generation (T100, T110, T120; 1973)  31 August 1973 saw the introduction of the Corona T100-Series, which continued to be built as a two-door or four-door sedans, a two-door hardtop coup√© (T110 chassis codes) and as a four-door station wagon (marketed as a van for commercial use in Japan). Chassis codes 100‚Äì105 were reserved for sedans, with 106‚Äì109 for vans, the 110‚Äì115 was for the hardtop coup√© while 116‚Äì119 was for the wagon versions. The 120-series model codes were used for late series face lifted models in the Japanese market fitted with the new emissions control TTC-C motors. The two-speed automatic was no longer offered. The face lift revised the hood and grille, and enlarged the tail lights. The station wagon featured optional wood panel body claddings. Engines were 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0-litre SOHC units. In North America, the 20R 2.2-litre engine was used. The high- performance 2000GT Sedan and Hardtop Coup√© with 18R-G twin cam engine were only offered in Japan. Yamaha supplied the alloy head for these high performance normally aspirated engines fitted with twin Mikuni-Solex 40 mm side-draft carburettors and a compression ratio of 9.7:1. Gearbox was the Porsche-type syncromesh 5-speed P51 coupled to a 4.1 F series limited slip differential, giving a claimed top speed of . In 1972, a new set of performance coupes is introduced on the Corolla platform called the Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno. 1976 Corona sedan (RT102, Japan) North American models had longer bumpers (hiding recoverable bumper shocks) to meet local impact standards; they gained standard radial tires in 1975. Side door impact upgrades were installed in all doors. This series also saw the standard (on some models) Electro Sensor Panel which monitored fluid and bulb status. As with earlier Coronas, some models had a shifter mounted on the steering column. Sales of the Corona continued to grow as a result of the 1973 oil crisis. The two-door hardtop continued, with trim levels 1600GL, 1800SR and the 2000SR, with the coup√© proving popular in the US but more popular yet in Japan. The two-door sedan, meanwhile, sold well in the United States but very little in Japan, and this was the last Corona to be offered in this bodystyle. The Corona saw new competitors in both Japan, Europe and the United States from the Honda Accord in 1976, and the Subaru DL in 1974. The advantage the Honda and Subaru had over the Corona was that both vehicles were front-wheel- drive, while the Corona was rear-wheel-drive. In response to the Japanese Governments passage of emission control regulations, Toyota introduced the Toyota TTC-V (Vortex) on the 19R engine only, using an Exhaust gas recirculation implementation. In Japan, the 12R-U engine was designed to run on LPG for taxi usage, starting in October 1975. To meet new emissions regulations the 1.6-litre 12R engine was replaced by the more modern 2T-J in commercial models. The 18R-E engine with fuel injection that was used in the 2000SL and 2000SR discontinued production due to emission issues. In November 1975, the 1800 saw the removal of the twin carburetors due to emission regulations, which meant the discontinuation of the 1800SR coup√©. June 1976 saw the installation of a catalyst system included with the TTC-C system. January 1977 saw a minor appearance change to both the interior and exterior, with a revised grille and hood, as well as new headlight surrounds. The taillights were also modified; while still rectangular, they were less busy in appearance. New Zealand assembly began with 1.6 OHV, three-speed manual column shift and bench front seat and 1.8-litre 16R OHC four-speed manual bucket front seat options. Later, the 18R 2.0-litre OHC engine replaced the 1.8 and was also offered with a three-speed automatic, the first auto Corona in New Zealand. Australian models had the 18R from the start, as did South African ones.  Sixth generation (T130; 1978)  Introduced in Japan in September 1978, the T130 series Corona adopted a boxier design over the outgoing T100/110/120 series. It maintained the standard front-engine / rear-wheel- drive layout of all Coronas that preceded it. The T130 series was available in a wide range of body styles across various markets including a four-door sedan, two-door hardtop coupe, four-door wagon and new five-door liftback, which featured a 40:60 split fold rear seat. The assignment of \\"T130\\" to all Corona body styles signified a new approach from having different series number identifiers for the various body styles. This was also the first Corona to be sold as a \\"Toyota\\" rather than a \\"Toyopet\\" in the Japanese domestic market. Corona XX sedan (Australia; facelift) Corona XX sedan (Australia; facelift) All models featured MacPherson strut independent front suspension as well as a four-link trailing arm rear suspension arrangement with a Panhard rod, except for the wagon, which used leaf springs, like the Corolla and Cressida wagons. Disc brakes were fitted as standard equipment on the front of all models. Rear disc brakes were fitted as standard on the 2000GT and 2000SL, which were not available to all international markets. Other models were fitted with rear drum brakes. The Corona range received a thorough facelift in August 1980, with new rearwards sloping rectangular headlights which gave it a more modern appearance at the front. The T130 series was manufactured with a wide range of engine and transmission combinations. 1.6-litre 12R, 2T (and associated 12T) and 2.0-litre 18R engines are the most common. The LPG-powered 12R engine became available in the Japanese domestic market in February 1979 and, along with the LPG-powered 5R engined model, continued to be built until August 1982. The rest of the Corona range was taken out of production for the Japanese market in December 1981. Amongst other minor changes, the 1.8-litre 3T / 13T engine was added in 1981 to replace the 1.6-litre 2T/12T. The North American Corona shared the 2.2-litre 20R engine with the Celica. Emission regulations passed in 1978 were applied across the range of models offered. The 1.8L engine was equipped with electronic fuel injection as well as the 2.0L engine. In Japan the venerable 2.0L 18R-G was offered in the range- topping 2000GT, developing 101 kW (135 hp) at 5800 rpm. The station wagon was, as usual at the time, marketed as a \\"light van\\" in Japan. This was registered as a commercial vehicle for certain tax benefits and less restrictive emissions standards. When introduced, the Corona Van was available as a 1600 (TT137V) or an 1800 (RT137V), both using engines not installed in the rest of the range. The 2T-J in the 1600 Standard produces at 6000 rpm while the DX and GL models' 1.8-liter 16R offered at 5600 rpm but with considerably more torque. The 2T and 16R were both replaced by the newer 12T-J engine in December 1979, reflecting newly tightened emissions standards for commercial vehicles in Japan. This model, the TT138V, produces at 5600 rpm. Production of the T130 ended in 1982, to be replaced by the T140 series. =Markets= ;United States The T130 was the last Corona to be marketed in the US. It was offered as a sedan, wagon, or liftback with either Base or LE (Luxury Edition) equipment. In North America, the Corona was replaced for the 1983 model year by the similarly sized but front-wheel-drive Camry sedan and five-door hatchback. Since then, the Camry has grown a size larger than the Corona and its sportier Carina sister car. The Corona was originally fitted with the 2.2-litre 20R engine, but along with a facelift for 1981 this was switched to the 2367 cc 22R with at 4800 rpm. The facelift version received a rearward- sloping front end and a modestly restyled rear; North American cars received quad rectangular headlamps and a standard five-speed manual or an optional four-speed automatic. ;Australia To meet an 85 percent overall local parts content as a manufacturer, Toyota Australia chose to manufacture Corona sedans and wagons using 1.9-litre Holden Starfire engines. As installed by Toyota, the engine received some minor changes in the form of its own camshaft, manifold, and carburettor. In Toyota engine terminology it received 1X badging and was coupled with a four-speed or optional five-speed Borg-Warner 505. A three-speed automatic was also available. Period commenters universally criticized the antiquated Holden powerplant as rough, lacking power, and excessively thirsty. There was also a very well-equipped Corona XX, recognizable by its alloy wheels (shared with the Supra). In spite of its air of sports and luxury, the Corona XX received the Starfire engine, albeit here only with a five-speed manual.Boyce, p. 170 Beginning in 1980, Toyota Australia also imported the five-door Corona liftback fitted with Toyota's own, much more modern 2.0-litre 18R-C engine with .Boyce, p. 171 In 1981 the Australian Corona received the same facelift as seen elsewhere, with a new rearward sloping front. Toyota's engineers also further modified the Holden engine in an effort to increase drivability and reliability, with new gaskets, valves, valve springs, and water pump. Outputs remained the same but the performance did increase marginally thanks to better engine response. The facelifted Corona XX now benefitted from an imported engine, the same 2-liter 21R-C as used in the Celica. ;New Zealand New Zealand assembly started with the 1.6-litre 12R engine and three-speed manual transmission with bench front seat, and 1.8-litre 3T (TT132) with a four-speed manual or three-speed automatic. The 1.6-litre was soon changed to the newer 2T engine, coupled with a four-speed manual and bucket front seats. Later in the run, Toyota NZ added a locally assembled Liftback version with the 1.8-litre engine and manual or automatic transmission. These models also had a standard radio and separate cassette deck‚Äîboth were rare factory fittings in the country at the time. ;Indonesia In Indonesia, the locally built T130 Corona was available as a 2000 (RT132) from 1979. From 1981 it became available as an 1800 (TT132). It was then replaced by the X60-series Toyota Corona Mark II. The Corona returned to Indonesia with the T150-series Corona FF.

Manufacture by Toyota Australia continued until 1987, by which time the T150 series had already been released. The T140 series was also brought out in a diesel/LPG powered, high-roofed taxicab version which was particularly popular in Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore. The T140 was not exported to many markets where the T130 had been sold (such as Indonesia), with many importers choosing to hold out for the front-wheel-drive T150. Starting with this generation series, the Toyota Carina platform was altered from its original Toyota Celica beginnings to the Corona platform. The Corona remained exclusive to Japanese dealerships Toyopet Store, and the Carina continued to be sold new only at Toyota Store locations in conjunction to the larger Toyota Crown. ;1982: 1600 Standard, DX, GL, SL 4dr sedan, 2dr hardtop, 4dr liftback coup√© (standard only sedan) 88 hp (12T-U) rigid rear axle 4-speed gearbox (SL 5-speed) brakes: front disc, rear drum 1800 DX, GL, CX, LX, SL 4dr sedan, 2dr hardtop, 4dr liftback coup√© 95 hp (13T-U) rigid rear axle 5-speed gearbox brakes: front disc, rear drum 1800 EFI SL, EFI SX 4dr sedan, 2dr hardtop, 4dr liftback coup√© 105 hp (3T-EU) rigid rear axle with anti-roll bar 5-speed gearbox brakes: front disc, rear disc 2000 CX 4dr sedan, 2dr hardtop, 4dr liftback coupe 105 hp (21R-U) rigid rear axle with anti-roll bar 5-speed gearbox brakes: front disc, rear disc 2000 GT II, GT 4dr sedan, 2dr hardtop, 4dr liftback coup√© 135 hp (18R-GEU) rigid rear axle with anti-roll bar 5-speed gearbox brakes: front disc, rear disc ;1983 onwards: Standard, DX, GX 4dr sedans 83 hp (3A-U) GX, EX 4dr sedan/2dr hardtop 100 hp (1S-U) GT 4dr sedan/2dr hardtop 130 hp (4A-GE) GT-T, GT-TR 4dr sedan/2dr hardtop 160 hp (3T-GTEU) For the Japanese market only, the five-door wagon (called \\"Van\\") was available with a 1.5-litre 5K-J petrol engine, a 1.6-litre 12T-J petrol engine or a 1.8-litre 1C diesel engine. The petrol engines had either a 4-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic gearbox but the diesel engine had a 5-speed manual gearbox. Some wagons had five doors but no rear seat. European export versions received the 2T four- cylinder, with DIN. There was also an 1.8-litre engine, as well as the 1.8-litre 1C diesel unit, with a claimed DIN. The T140 Corona was not exported in large numbers to Europe, as most importers focused on the slightly smaller Carina and then the front-wheel-drive T150-series cars. After the late 1985 introduction of the T160 Corona coupe, the rear-wheel-drive coup√© was discontinued. The sedan range was gradually whittled down and by May 1986 only the 1.5 and 1.8 (3A-U, 1S-U) remained, along with a 1.5 Van (KT147V) and a 1.8 Diesel Van. These continued to be available until the December 1987 introduction of the T170-series Corona. File:Toyota Corona 1983 2door.jpg1983 Corona coupe (Japan) File:Toyota Corona 2000GT.jpgToyota Corona 2000 GT Twin Cam (RT140, Japan) ;Australia For the Australian market, there were two models sold between 1983 and 1987: the ST141 with a 2.0-litre 2S-C and from 1984, the RT142, fitted with a 2.4-litre fuel-injected 22R-E. Both models were available in either sedan or wagon body styles. The lower S and CS trim levels (2.0-litre) were fitted standard with a four-speed manual transmission (optional five-speed manual and three- or four-speed automatic). The top trim level was the 2.0-litre CS-X until November 1984 when replaced by the 2.4-litre CSi and luxury Avante models (2.0- and 2.4-litre). Toyota released a limited edition Olympic model in 1984, offering a full digital instrument cluster in either manual or automatic and in both sedan and wagon body variants. In 1985, a limited edition SR model was offered in white and manual transmission only with front and rear spoilers, white painted grille and side mirrors, white highlights in the tail lamps (instead of black), SR lettering on the boot lid, red exterior pinstriping, sports front seats with red pin stripes, and a three-spoke leather steering wheel. Toyota Australia introduced a facelift in November 1985. This included the addition the former CS-X grille insert for the S model and the Avante grille for the CS and CSi. There were also new wheels trims on all versions and revised tail lamp lenses. The pre-facelift models can be identified by tail lamps with dual black horizontal lines engraved along the base. The facelift models received lenses with a single, more subtle, horizontal line intersecting across the centre of the tail lights and a chrome strip at the base. Facelift CS and CSi wagons received a horizontal strip across the tailgate and additional black plastic mouldings surrounding the license plate.

It was first introduced with the 1.8-litre 1C diesel engine in January 1982 (CT140).List of RT140 Coronas sold in Japan. Toyota Motor Co., No. 261150 In September a 1.8-litre LPG version (YT140) was added to the lineup. In addition to getting a new rear end and a taller, more upright roof line for a more comfortable rear seat, alterations were also made to the headlights and grille. While based on the T140, the front and rear sections took their design cues from the A60 Carina. In December 1986 the car underwent a light facelift, and the diesel option was upgraded to the 2-litre 2C version (CT141). The car was not generally sold for private use. After November 1991, the diesel option was no longer available for the Japanese market but was still available for export (e.g. Macau). Production only came to an end in April 1998, generally being replaced by the S150-series Crown (later renamed Comfort). This marked the end of the Corona taxi line. Most 140/141-series Corona taxis have been long replaced with newer vehicles; it did remain in common use for a long time in both Macau and Pakistan. File:1982-1987 Toyota Corona (T140) 01.jpg Corona (T140) taxi File:Toyota Corona (CT141) (rear), Sungai Besi.jpg Corona (T140) taxi  Eighth generation (T150; 1983)  Rear view of 1986 Toyota Corona EX-Saloon (AT151) The T150 Corona was known as the Corona FF, selling alongside the more traditional and recently facelifted rear-wheel-drive Corona (T140-series). Essentially a shortened version of the Camry, this was part of Toyota's very cautious approach to introducing front- wheel-drive vehicles. Toyota returned to a platform naming tradition, assigned to different body styles this generation was made available, abandoned in 1978. The Corona FF as introduced in January 1983 was only available with a five-door liftback body style, and only with the carburetted 1.8-litre 1S-LU inline-four. In October 1983 a more traditional four-door sedan was added, and the T150 gradually became the main part of the Corona lineup as the T140-series shrank in importance. In 1983, the T150 Corona became the first Japanese made car with digital color liquid crystal gauges. Along with the new bodystyle, more engines were also added: a smaller 1.5-litre 3A-LU at the bottom, while the 1.8 was now available with fuel injection (1S-ELU) and . There was also a two-litre diesel (2C-L) and the carburetted 1.8 was replaced by the central point injected 1S-iLU, with an extra five horsepower. In 1984, this chassis was also used as the basis for a new, front-wheel-drive version of the Carina sedan. In August 1985 the Corona underwent a small change, largely consisting of new, bigger taillights. Also new was the related Celica and Carina range. With a more sporting chassis and five-lug wheels (rather than four), this received the new T160 chassis code. This chassis, as well as the twin-cam two-litre 3S-GELU engine with (JIS) at 6400 rpm was used for the new Corona 2.0 GT and GT-R versions. A sporting 1.8 SX-R version (1S-ELU) of the 160-series sedan was also added in late 1985. ;Export markets Toyota Corona 1.8 GL Liftback (AT151, Thailand) The Corona hatchback was eventually dropped in Australia in 1983 in favour of the larger Camry and the previous- generation saloon and estate were dropped in 1987 to be replaced by the Toyota Camry#V20, but in New Zealand, Toyota continued to offer the Corona, assembled locally at Toyota's plant in Thames, New Zealand. Initially, the T150 Corona was launched in New Zealand in 1983 as a hatchback only, to complement the previous generation T140 Corona saloon and estate which continued to be sold in the New Zealand market as in Australia. However, the T140 saloon was dropped in 1985 and the T150 Corona saloon was then launched to replace it. With suspension fettled by racer Chris Amon, the New Zealand Coronas had carburetted 1.8s or a fuel-injected 2-litre engine. Later, Toyota New Zealand followed Australia's lead and eventually dropped the Corona in 1996, instead marketing the Australian-built Camry as its offering in the mid-size segment of the market. Export-market Coronas were generally fitted with the 1.6-litre 4A engine, but in many markets (New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Latin America) the T150 Corona was also available with 2.0-litre engines. In Southeast Asia, the 1.6 EX-Saloon with no emissions gear (4A-L) produces at 5600 rpm. In Indonesia, the original T150 was sold as the Corona GL and after the 1985 facelift it became the Corona EX-Saloon (AT151). Toyota's large family car lineup in Europe was quite confusing when looking over the past 25 years. The 1970 through 1983 Carina sister models had been sold in most of Europe, but in 1984 they were replaced with the \\"Carina II\\" ‚Äì which was really the 1983 model Corona as sold in Japan with alterations to the headlights, grille and trim (the Carina in Japan at that time was a similar but boxier vehicle.) = Corona Coup√© (T160; 1985‚Äì1989) = 1987 Corona VX Coup√© (T160) When the Celica was realigned from its former Toyota \\"A-series\\" RWD platform to share the Corona \\"T-series\\" FWD platform, the Celica notchback was rebranded as the Corona Coup√© in Japan, which was identical to the internationally available Celica version with the only difference being the removal of the retractable headlights in favour of conventional fixed items.Automobil Revue 1987, p. 545 This replaced the rear-wheel-drive T140 Corona Coup√©, leaving only a few vans and sedans in the RWD Corona lineup. The T160-series cars have a somewhat longer wheelbase as well as a wider track (front and rear) than the Celica version available elsewhere in the world. The Corona Coup√© remained exclusive to Toyopet Store Japanese dealerships along with the larger, all new Toyota Soarer, while the Celica liftback and convertible remained at Toyota Corolla Store locations. The Corona Coup√© was manufactured from 1985 until 1989. In 1994 it was belatedly replaced by the Toyota Curren and sold at Toyota Vista Store locations. The Corona Coup√© came with three engines; the SOHC 1.8-litre 1S-iLU and two twin-cams, the 1.6-litre 4A-GELU or the 2-litre 3S-GELU. Chassis codes are ST160, AT160, and ST162. In May 1988 the 1.8-litre engine was replaced by the twin-cam 4S-FiLU.  Ninth generation (T170; 1987)  The Corona and the Toyota Carina continued to increase in size as its popularity grew. Because of Japanese taxation laws, both models got to the maximum permitted for a lower tax bracket, and in the 1980s and early 1990s, the cars were the same size. The previous generation ST160 Corona Coup√© did not update with this generation, and was not replaced until 1993, when it was renamed as the Toyota Curren. For this generation, the new Corona EXiV four-door hardtop would have to do for those looking for something extra. This was the last generation to offer the Corona GT to Japanese buyers, equipped with Toyota's active suspension technology called TEMS included with their \\"PEGASUS\\"-branded four-wheel independent suspension and \\"LASRE\\"-branded multi-port fuel injection technology on the 3S-GELU engine. The five-door Corona liftback was sold as the \\"Corona SF\\" in Japan, in a much smaller lineup than the four-door sedan. The five-door model proved much more popular in Europe, where, confusingly, it was marketed as the Carina II. The sedan and a wagon were also part of the Carina II lineup, which was a rebadged Corona rather than the T170 Carina sold in Japan. The lightly restyled Carina T170 series derivative was launched in Japan in December 1987. A limited production Corona was sold only in Japan in May 1990, to celebrate 10 million Corona's having been sold, called the Corona Super Roomy. It added to the wheelbase, and was limited to 500 units. = Corona EXiV (T180) = The T180 series Corona was introduced as the Toyota Corona EXiV which was shared with a Carina twin, called the Toyota Carina ED. According to Toyota, the letters EXiV derived from the words EXtra impressiVe. The Corona EXiV followed from the successes of the Corona Coup√©, by introducing a sleek appearance of a low-slung coup√©, while adding two more doors, in the tradition of a four-door coup√©. Built on the same version of the Corona chassis as that used for the Celica, this was a continuation of the sporting T160 series Corona although it now received its own bodywork.  Tenth generation (T190; 1992)  Introduced in March 1992, the new Corona made its European debut at Geneva Auto Show. In Europe, the Corona was known as the Toyota Carina E and it replaced the Carina II (T170). The Carina E was built at Toyota's new factory at Burnaston, near Derby, England, United Kingdom, but the early cars and all GT-i models were built in Tsutsumi, Japan. The cars were imported in Europe from the third quarter of 1992 until the opening of the Burnaston factory in December that year. For the Japanese domestic market, the Corona's platform twin the Carina received different bodywork. This generation of Corona received a redesign to be larger, heavier, and have the completely rounded, aerodynamic shape of the 1990s. The exterior dimensions and engine sizes remained in compliance with Japanese size regulations so as to continue to offer a product for Japanese buyers wanting to reduce their annual tax liability. The five-door model was called the Corona SF in Japan, while the station wagon had become a separate line there, from 1993, called the Toyota Caldina. The T190 is the last Corona for most export markets. It was marketed as Corona \\"Absolute\\" in Indonesia, or Corona Exsior in the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand. In mainland Europe, the Carina E was offered in XL and GL trim levels, but in the UK they were marketed as Xi (1.6-litre), XLi (1.6, 1.8-litre), SLi (1.8-litre), GLi (1.6, 1.8, 2.0-litre), GTi (2.0-litre, no estate) and Executive (2.0-litre, no estate) between 1992 and 1996. Diesels were available as the 2.0-litre XLD and GLD trims. From 1996, the S (1.6-litre, hatchback only), GS (1.6, 1.8-litre), CD (1.6, 1.8, 2.0-litre), and CDX (1.8, 2.0-litre) trims replaced the previous trim level scheme. Diesels were now the 2.0-litre GS and GL trims. The high performance GT-i with 3S-GE engine was offered in small numbers in certain European countries. All versions (apart from GTi/Executive) were available as a four- door saloon, five-door hatchback or five-door estate car. Badged as a Carina, this was the 1993 Semperit Irish Car of the Year. It was also sold in New Zealand, but not in Australia. Engines were the same as the Toyota Carina E, except there was no diesel variant. The station wagon variant was a badge- engineered Toyota Caldina. The sedans and liftbacks were assembled in Thames, New Zealand, while the wagon was imported fully built up from Japan. The locally assembled cars also received special spring and damper combinations (again developed by racer Chris Amon) as well as some other changes. In the Philippines, the Corona was only available with the 2.0-litre 3S-FE engine throughout its production from 1993 to 1998. Early examples of the Corona T190 (ST191) looks similar to the 1992 Japanese spec model. It only has the 2.0 EX Saloon variant, with a choice of a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 1995 model has the facelifted exterior, having the front and rear bumpers with the black trim, and the standard three-piece rear spoiler. The Exsior was introduced in 1996, this time with extended bumpers and red/amber tail lights and garnish. Another variant of the Corona Exsior was the LE, which had genuine leather seats, faux dash wood panel, and electronic air purifier/ionizer as standard equipment. It was eventually replaced in 1998 with the Toyota Camry XV20. Production in Japan ended in 1995, but in Europe and Southeast Asia it lasted until the end of 1997, when it was replaced by the Avensis, which was also built at Burnaston. = Corona EXiV (T200) = The T200 series Corona was sold as the continuation of the Toyota Corona EXiV hardtop sedan, while the Corona Coup√©'s successor was relocated to Toyota Vista Store locations and reintroduced as the Toyota Curren. 1993 Corona EXiV = Caldina (1992) = Caldina (T190) The first Toyota Caldina was the five- door wagon or commercial van version of the four-door sedan Toyota Corona in Japan. The wagon has independent strut rear suspension while the commercial wagon has semi-independent leaf springs. The wagon was given its own identity, whereas previous station wagon versions were named Corona wagons. The Caldina was introduced as a successor to the Corona and Carina wagons, and was sold at Toyota Japanese dealerships Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. The Caldina was introduced after the Subaru Legacy wagon and the Nissan Avenir wagon.  Eleventh generation (T210; 1996)  = Corona Premio (T210; 1996) = A final, tenth generation was built between 1996 and 2001 for the Japanese market, with one particular model called the Toyota Corona Premio that was spun off into an independent model called the Premio (coded ST210), with the Allion following after the Carina after 2001. The Corona Premio was offered as Base Premio, Premio E, and Premio G. Four-cylinder engine choices are 1.6-litre 4A-FE, 1.8-litre lean burn 7A-FE, and 2.0-litre 3S-FE. Diesel engines offered were 2.0-litre 2C-T and later on replaced by more economical 2.2-litre 3C-T. This is the last model using Corona name in Japan. The automatic model of the Corona Premio came with three selectable driving modes for its electronically controlled transmission: Normal, ECT PWR (power mode), and ECT MANU (manual mode). = Caldina (1997) = Caldina (T210) Caldina (T210) Sharing a platform with the T210 series Toyota Corona and Toyota Carina, the Caldina is the Japanese version of the Toyota Avensis, which replaced the Carina E in Europe. The 4WD models are coded ST215, and are offered as Active Sports GT with the 3S-GE engine. The top of the line GT-T came with the turbocharged 4th generation 3S-GTE engine, and included an all- wheel-drive system similar to the Toyota Celica GT-Four. The GT-T also came with optional electronic stability control(VSC) (standard on Active Sports versions). The Aerial version features a large sunroof and contoured roof racks as standard. Weighing , the Caldina GT-T offers similar performance to a Subaru WRX wagon achieving 0‚Äì100 km/h in 7 seconds. A refresh was given in 2000 with new bumpers and lamps a refreshed interior and extra lug added to the turbo manifold to stop the warping issue common on earlier GT-T models. Engines for lesser models are the 1.8 L 7A-FE, the 2.0 L gasoline 3S-FE, and the 2.2 L diesel 3C-TE. = South America (T220; 1997) = Avensis Avensis For the subsequent model series, the T220, the Corona name was dropped. It was built as sedan, liftback and wagon. Only the wagon was sold in Japan as the Caldina built on the T210 platform. The sedan and liftback were mainly sold in Europe as Avensis, and the lower grade model for taxi called Corona. Four- cylinder engines for the Avensis is 1.6, 1.8, 2.0 gasoline, and diesel. The Corona Taxi has turbo diesel. In South America, the Avensis is renamed Corona and powered by 2.0-litre 3S-FE engine. This is the last Corona, and the third- generation Caldina was built on the new T240 platform, which was also used in the Allion and Premio.

Any number of styles can be used to convey these forms. A good working definition of, \\"Style\\", is how something is done. Theatrical styles are influenced by their time and place, artistic and other social structures, as well as the individual style of the particular artist or artists. As theater is a mongrel art form, a production may or may not have stylistic integrity with regard to script, acting, direction, design, music, and venue. Styles There are a variety of theatrical styles used in theatre/drama. These include Naturalism Portraying life on stage with close attention to detail, based on observation of real life. Cause and affect are central to the script's structure, with the subjects focused on conflicts of \\"nature vs. nurture\\", the natural order of things, survival, notions of evolution. The production style is one of everyday reality. Realism Portraying characters on stage that are close to real life, with realistic settings and staging. Realism is an effort to satisfy all the theatrical conventions necessary to the production, but to do so in a way that seems to be \\"normal\\" life. Expressionism Anti-realistic in seeing appearance as distorted and the truth lies within man. The outward appearance on stage can be distorted and unrealistic to portray an external truth or internal emotional conflict. Absurdity and Surrealism Presents a perspective that all human attempts at significance are illogical. Ultimate truth is chaos with little certainty. There is no necessity that needs to drive us. Epic Theatre As devised by Bertolt Brecht, epic theatre forces audience members to constantly return to rational observation, rather than emotional immersion. Sudden bursts of song, elements of absurdity and breaches of the fourth wall are all prime examples of how this rational observation is constantly revitalized; this idea is known as Verfremdungseffekt. Melodrama As devised by early Greek dramatists, these styles rely on stock characters and stereotypes to portray stories in an exaggerated way, either tragic or comic. Links to commedia dell'arte. Theatre of Cruelty As developed by Antonin Artaud, a style that encourages the shock and horror of the audience, through the excessive use of light and sound, instead of active entertainment or emotional relaxation. Physical theatre A modernist approach to theatre which centralises a performer's movement as the key communicator of a play's storytelling. Poor theatre Developed by Jerzy Growotski, this genre believes in the stripping back of set, props, costume, light and sound to allow the focus to be placed solely upon the actors, their characterisation and the underlying human relationships. Immersive theatre Developed by Augusto Boal, these styles all place focus on the audience member's individuality: their personal decisions, opinions and emotions, and how that impacts those of the characters onstage. The audience firmly exists within the 'world of the play'. Links to Promenade and Forum theatre.

A tuner is a subsystem that receives radio frequency (RF) transmissions and converts the selected carrier frequency and its associated bandwidth into a fixed frequency that is suitable for further processing, usually because a lower frequency is used on the output. Broadcast FM/AM transmissions usually feed this intermediate frequency (IF) directly into a demodulator that converts the radio signal into audio-frequency signals that can be fed into an amplifier to drive a loudspeaker. More complex transmissions like PAL/NTSC (TV), DAB (digital radio), DVB-T/DVB-S/DVB-C (digital TV) etc. use a wider frequency bandwidth, often with several subcarriers. These are transmitted inside the receiver as an intermediate frequency (IF). Subcarriers are then processed like real radio transmissions, but the whole bandwidth is sampled with an analog-to-digital converter (A/D) at a rate faster than the Nyquist rate (that is, at least twice the IF frequency). A tuner can also refer to a radio receiver or standalone audio component that is part of an audio system, to be connected to a separate amplifier. The verb tuning in radio contexts means adjusting the receiver to detect the desired radio signal carrier frequency that a particular radio station uses.  Design  Inductively coupled crystal radio receiver The simplest tuner consists of an inductor and capacitor connected in parallel, where the capacitor or inductor is made to be variable. This creates a resonant circuit which responds to an alternating current at one frequency. Combined with a detector, also known as a demodulator (diode D1 in the circuit), it becomes the simplest radio receiver, often called a crystal set. Older models would realize manual tuning by means of mechanically operated ganged variable capacitors. Often several sections would be provided on a tuning capacitor, to tune several stages of the receiver in tandem, or to allow switching between different frequency bands. A later method used a potentiometer supplying a variable voltage to varactor diodes in the local oscillator and tank circuits of front end tuner, for electronic tuning. Modern radio tuners use a superheterodyne receiver with tuning selected by adjustment of the frequency of a local oscillator. This system shifts the radio frequency of interest to a fixed frequency so that it can be tuned with fixed-frequency band-pass filter. Still later, phase locked loop methods were used, with microprocessor control. In a self-contained radio receiver for audio, the signal from the detector after the tuner is run through a volume control and to an amplifier stage. The amplifier feeds either an internal speaker or headphones. In a tuner component of an audio system (for example, a home high-fidelity system or a public address system in a building), the output of the detector is connected to a separate external system of amplifiers and speakers. The broadcast audio FM band ( in most countries) is around higher in frequency than the AM band and provides enough space for a bandwidth of This bandwidth is sufficient to transmit both stereo channels with almost the full hearing range. Sometimes, additional subcarriers are used for unrelated audio or data transmissions. The left and right audio signals must be combined into a single signal which is applied to the modulation input of the transmitter; this is done by the addition of an inaudible subcarrier signal to the FM broadcast signal. FM stereo allows left and right channels to be transmitted. The availability of FM stereo, a quieter VHF broadcast band, and better fidelity led to the specialization of FM broadcasting in music, tending to leave AM broadcasting with spoken-word material. Restoration Standalone audio stereo FM tuners are sought after for audiophile and TV/FM DX applications, especially those produced in the 1970s and early 1980s, when performance and manufacturing standards were among the highest. In many instances the tuner may be modified to improve performance. A growing hobby trend is the electronics specialists that buy, collect and restore these vintage FM or AM/FM audio tuners. The restoration usually begins with replacing the electrolytic capacitors that may age over time. The tuner is outfitted with improved tolerance and better sounding upgraded parts. Prices have increased relative to the increasing demand for the older audio tuners. Those with the most value are the best sounding, most rare (collectible), the best DX capable (distance reception) and the known build quality of the component, as it left the factory.amfmdx.net - FM Tuner Mods AM/FM Most of the early tuner models were designed and manufactured to receive only the AM broadcast band. As FM became more popular, the limitations of AM became more apparent, and FM became the primary listening focus, especially for stereo and music broadcasting. Few companies even manufacture dedicated FM or AM/FM tuners now, as these bands are most often included in a low cost chip for A/V systems, more as an afterthought, rather than designed for the critical FM listener. In Europe, where a second AM broadcast band is used for longwave broadcasting, tuners may be fitted with both the standard medium wave and the additional longwave band. However, radios with only medium wave are also common, especially in countries where there are no longwave broadcasters. Rarely, radios are sold with only FM and longwave, but no medium wave band. Some tuners may also be equipped with one or more short wave bands. Television Sega Game Gear A television tuner converts a radio frequency analog television or digital television transmission into audio and video signals which can be further processed to produce sound and a picture. Different tuners are used for different television standards such as PAL, NTSC, ATSC, SECAM, DVB-C, DVB-T, DVB-T2, ISDB, T-DMB, open cable. An example frequency range is , with a tuning frequency step size of Modern solid-state internal TV-tuner modules typically weigh around ivtvdriver.org - FM1216ME (MK3 family). Multi-Standard Desktop Video & FM, Radio Module, 2001-10-18 Before the use of solid-state frequency synthesizers, covering the broad range of TV signal frequencies with a single tuned circuit and sufficient precision was uneconomic. Television channel frequencies were non-contiguous, with many non-broadcast services interleaved between VHF channels 6 and 7 in North America, for example. Instead, TV tuners of the era incorporated multiple sets of tuned circuits for the main signal path and local oscillator circuit. These \\"turret\\" tuners mechanically switched the receiving circuits by rotating a knob to select the desired channel. Channels were presented in fixed sequence, with no means to skip channels unused in a particular area. When UHF TV broadcasting was made available, often two complete separate tuner stages were used, with separate tuning knobs for selection of VHF band and UHF band channels. To allow for a small amount of drift or misalignment of the tuner with the actual transmitted frequency, tuners of that era included a \\"fine tuning\\" knob to allow minor adjustment for best reception. The combination of high frequencies, multiple electrical contacts, and frequent changing of channels in the tuner made it a high maintenance part of the television receiver, as relatively small electrical or mechanical problems with the tuner would make the set unusable. Analog tuners can tune only analog signals. An ATSC tuner is a digital tuner that tunes digital signals only. Some digital tuners provide an analog bypass. VHF/UHF TV tuners are rarely found as a separate component, but are incorporated into television sets. Cable boxes and other set top boxes contain tuners for digital TV services, and send their output via SCART or other connector, or using an RF modulator (typically on in Europe and in North America) to TV receivers that do not natively support the services. They provide outputs via composite, S-video, or component video. Many can be used with video monitors that do not have a TV tuner or direct video input. They are often part of a VCR or digital video recorder (DVR, PVR). Many home computers in the 1970s and 1980s used an RF modulator to connect to a TV set. Personal computers may be fitted with expansion cards (typically with PCI or USB interface) providing a TV tuner and digital signal processor (DSP). They may be dedicated TV tuner cards, or incorporated into a video card. These cards allow a computer to display and capture television programs. Many earlier models were stand-alone tuners, designed only to deliver TV pictures through a VGA connector; this allowed viewing television on a computer display, but did not support recording television programs. Smartphone and tablets can use a Micro USB DVB-T receiver to watch DVB-T TV. Electronic tuner An electronic tuner is a device which tunes across a part of the radio frequency spectrum by the application of a voltage or appropriate digital code words. This type of tuner supersedes mechanical tuners, which were tuned by manual adjustment of capacitance or inductance in the tuned circuits. In a more practical and everyday sense, a radio or television set which is tuned by manually turning a knob or dial contains a manual tuner into which the shaft of that knob or dial extends. Early model televisions and radios were tuned by a rack of buttons; some of the earlier types were purely mechanical and adjusted the capacitance or inductance of the tuned circuit to a preset number of positions corresponding to the frequencies of popular local stations. Later electronic types used the varactor diode as a voltage controlled capacitance in the tuned circuit, to receive a number of preset voltages from the rack of buttons tuning the device instantly to local stations. The mechanical button rack was popular in car radios of the 1960s and 1970s. The electronic button rack controlling the new electronic varactor tuner was popular in television sets of the 1970s and 1980s. Modern electronic tuners also use varactor diodes as the actual tuning elements, but the voltages which change their capacitance are obtained from a digital to analog converter (DAC) driven by a microprocessor or phase locked loop (PLL) arrangement. This modern form allows for very precise tuning and locking-in on weak signals, as well as a numerical display of the tuned frequency.

First generation (R31; 1986‚Äì1990)  The first generation R31 Nissan Pintara is a compact family car which was built by Nissan Australia at its Clayton, Victoria assembly plant in Melbourne from mid-1986. Replacing the locally produced Nissan Bluebird (910), it was based on the Nissan SkylineAngas MacKenzie, Second Guessing Nissan Pintara, Car Australia, July 1986, pages 48-52. with a single fuel-injected 2.0-litre four- cylinder engine, entirely built and sold in Australia to compete with the Mitsubishi Magna. Like the Australian-built six cylinder R31 Skyline, it was offered in sedan and station wagon form. Four specification levels of the R31 Pintara were offered: GLi, Executive, GX, and GXE. A TRX bodykit package was offered for the GX and GXE sedans, featuring a front and rear air dam, rear spoiler, side skirts, grille cover, alloy wheels and low profile tyres. Unlike the later U12 TRX, this did not feature any mechanical upgrades. 1986 Pintara GXE sedan 1989‚Äì1990 Pintara Executive wagon The sole engine choice was a 2.0-litre CA20E inline-four, producing (DIN) at 5200 rpm and (DIN) at 3200 rpm. This unit was SOHC, multi-point fuel injected featuring electronic concentrated control system (ECCS) including electronic ignition. It featured two spark plugs per cylinder to help meet emission requirements. Rather than build the U11 Bluebird, Nissan Australia had chosen to go the route of building a localised four-cylinder Skyline, because of the Bluebird's switch to front-wheel drive with the U11. Nissan Australia had feared that the new front-wheel drive design would not resonate well with the Australian consumer, as the Australian market was well acclimated to rear-wheel drive at the time. For this reason, rival Toyota had continued to produce the rear-wheel drive T140 Corona up to 1987 for the Australian market, despite most other markets receiving the front-wheel-drive T150. The reality of marketing a front-wheel drive Bluebird in the Australian market would come into fruition with the succeeding U12 model.  Second generation (U12; 1989‚Äì1992)  The first generation Pintara was replaced in 1989 by a model initially dubbed by the media as \\"Project Matilda\\",Information, Opportunism and Economic Coordination, Peter E. Earl, Edward Elgar Publishing, 2002, page 28 which turned out to be a locally produced front-wheel drive version of the Nissan Bluebird (U12), rather than a model uniquely designed for Australia as initial stories had indicated. However, the model performed badly in local testing, and required body and chassis strengthening.BRW: The Magazine of Australian & New Zealand Business, Volumes 1-2, BRW Publications, 1991, page 27 In Australia, this was sold as the Nissan Pintara (U12), also available as a locally designed five- door \\"Superhatch\\". The sedan and Superhatch were exported to New Zealand as the Nissan Bluebird (replacing locally assembled models sourced from Japan) while the Superhatch was exported to Japan as the Bluebird Aussie.Nissan Bluebird Oozui: When Australia (Briefly) Exported Cars to Japan, August 26, 2012 The U12 model was discontinued in mid-1992 when Nissan Australia ended local production and New Zealand reverted to local assembly of the next generation Bluebird from Japanese kits. Under the Button car plan, in which local manufacturers shared models, Ford Australia marketed a rebadged version of the U12 Pintara sedan and hatchback as the Ford Corsair.The Bulletin, Volumes 114-115, 1993, page 70 In addition, Ford provided the tooling and stamped the car's body panels.Rubber Market Review, 1989 Nissan fitted a 2.0-litre CA20E inline-four engine to the GLi and Executive levels of trim. This engine was rated at (DIN) at 5200 rpm for power, and (DIN) at 4000 rpm torque.Ford Corsair sales brochure, Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited, September 1989.

It was launched March 11, 2008 on mission STS-123. Dextre is part of Canada's contribution to the ISS and is named to represent its dexterous nature. Dextre is the third Canadian robotic arm used on the ISS, preceded by the Space Shuttle's Canadarm and the large Canadarm2. Dextre was designed and manufactured by MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA).CanWest News Service, '\\"Canada Hand\\" successfully installed' , 15 March 2006 In the early morning of February 4, 2011, Dextre completed its first official assignment which consisted of unpacking two pieces for Kounotori 2 while the on-board crew was sleeping.Dextre Successfully Completes Its First Official Job, NASA, 2011-02-04 Purpose Dextre is designed to handle orbital replacement units: Many spares are stored on the ISS and Dextre is able to carry them to and from worksites and install replacements when failures occur. Before Dextre arrived astronauts were required to perform space walks to carry out this work. Structure Dextre resembles a gigantic torso fitted with two extremely agile, arms. Total mass is about . The 3.5-metre-long body pivots at the \\"waist\\". The body has a Power Data grapple fixture at the 'head' end that can be grasped by the larger Space Station Arm, Canadarm2 so that Dextre can be positioned at the various Orbital Replacement Unit (ORU) worksites around the Space Station. The other end of the body has a Latching End Effector virtually identical to that of Canadarm2, so that Dextre can also be attached to Space Station grapple fixtures or the Mobile Base System. Dextre can also be operated whilst it is attached to the end of Canadarm2. Each arm is somewhat like a shortened Canadarm2 (in that it has 7 joints) but is fixed to Dextre at one end. At the end of Dextre's arms are ORU/Tool Changeout Mechanisms (OTCM). The OTCM has built-in grasping jaws, a retractable socket drive, a monochrome TV camera, lights, and an umbilical connector that can provide power, data, and video to/from a payload. Dextre moves one arm at a time, while one arm may hold onto the station (using specially provided standard H or Micro interfaces) for stability and ease of control the other is available to perform tasks. Tools The lower body of Dextre has a pair of orientable colour TV cameras with lights, a platform for stowing ORUs, and a tool holster. The tool holster is equipped with two Robotic Micro Conical Tools (RMCTs), which allow an arm to grasp additional types of ORU fixtures. The Socket Extension Tool (SET) extends the length of the grasping socket on an arm, and the Robotic Off-Set Tool (ROST) allows an arm to grasp difficult to reach targets. Several new tools were added as part of the 2011 Robotic Refueling Mission. A Wire Cutter, Safety Cap Removal Tool, EVR Nozzle Tool and a Multifunction Tool with several adapters. These tools are not installed on Dextre but are used by Dextre when performing RRM operations. The tools are not considered a part of Dextre's complement of tools and are stowed on the RRM platform. In 2013 the H-II Transport Vehicle brought the RRM On-orbit Transfer Cage (ROTC), which is a sliding table within the Japanese airlock platform from which to retrieve and subsequently install new hardware. Robotic Refueling Mission ‚Äî Phase 2 will use the Visual Inspection Poseable Invertebrate Robot (VIPIR) borescope camera with a 34 inch long flexible tube. =Future possibilities= SARAH (Self-Adaptive Robotic Auxiliary Hand) is a three fingered hand that is designed to attach to the end of Dextre's arm. It has not been delivered to the ISS. Design and delivery Dextre was designed and manufactured by MDA Space Missions as part of the $200-million contracted by the Canadian Space Agency, which will oversee its future operations and the necessary training of station crews. It completed all necessary testing and was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, in mid-June 2007. Once at KSC, it underwent flight verification testing followed by shuttle integration. Installation Dextre was launched to the ISS on March 11, 2008 aboard on mission STS-123. It \\"woke up\\" and activated heaters needed for keeping its joints and electronics warm after receiving power from the space station's Canadarm2 on March 14. During the mission's second spacewalk on March 16, spacewalking astronauts attached the two arms to the robot's main body and further prepared the machine for its handyman job on the station. After the spacewalk, crew members hooked Dextre back up to the station's robotic arm to keep it warm and to allow NASA to perform tests to ensure all of Dextre's electronics were working properly. Later that day, the crew tested all of its joints and brakes. Astronauts finished outfitting the robot during a third spacewalk on March 17, 2008. Operation use After testing and trials the first use planned in the removal and replacement of the RPCM (Remote Power Control Module) in 2009.ISS preparing for debuts of Canada's Dextre operations and Japan's HTV. Apr 2009 Additional usage In early August 2004 NASA declared its intention to use Dextre (or a close copy of it) as the robotic component for the Hubble Space Telescope rescue mission. Months after awarding a contract to MDA Space Missions to provide an SPDM copy for the Hubble repair mission,MDA Space Missions official site NASA then canceled the mission in favour of flying a Shuttle mission to perform the repairs/upgrades. NASA cited excessive risks and new-found confidence in the Space Shuttle external tank as reasons for the cancellation. Dextre was the subject of an April Fool's Day joke article on April 1, 2008 on NASA's APOD website.

In the Domesday Book, it was used for some territories north of the River Ribble included together with parts of Yorkshire. The area eventually became part of Lancashire, sitting geographically between the Rivers Lune and Ribble, in the strip of coast between the Irish Sea and Bowland Forest. Etymology and history In the 19th century, the name was said to have been first recorded in 705, as Hacmunderness. The Domesday Book in 1086 spells it Agemundrenessa. There are two suggested etymologies for Amounderness. The traditional 19th century reading was that the name derived from ac (oak) and mund (protection), \\"a ness or promontory sheltered by oaks\\". This was given currency by Porter.Porter, J, A History of the Fylde of Lancashire (Porter & Sons: Fleetwood and Blackpool 1876; repr. 1968) The current view is that the area is named after Agmundr, a Norse warlord, vassal of Eowils, Halfdan and Ingwaer, co-kings of Jorvik, all four of whom died at the Battle of Tettenhall in August 910;Smallshire, JL, Wednesfield: The Field of Woden (Workers' Education Association: Wolverhampton 1978) Partington's early 20th-century description of \\"Amounder ... the first Viking who settled in the Fylde country\\" now being considered more fanciful than historically accurate. It was usual for the name of hundreds to refer to a \\"moot-stow\\" or meeting place and the element \\"-ness\\" (ON, promontory) suggests the Over-Wyre as one distinct possibility. Certainly, there is some evidence to suggest the line of the Wyre/Calder rivers may have marked a north-south sub-division of the hundred in the early C10th. In The Place-names of Lancashire, Ekwall supports an early 10th-century coinage citing A[g]hemundesnes and the late 11th-century Agmundrenesse. The etymology of Agmundr is Old West Scandinavian agi- (\\"awe, terror\\") or possibly the German *ag- (\\"point, weapon point\\"), with -mundr, from Old West Scandinavian *-munduR (\\"protection\\"). The name appears in Old Swedish as Aghmund and in Old West Norse as Ogmundr. While the formal title of the warrior was almost certainly Agmundrholdr, his familiar or lall-name would have been Mundi. Victorian commentators, such as Porter, often cited a 7th-century grant made at Ripon by Ecgfrith of Northumbria and √Üthelwine as proof that Amounderness existed before the 10th century. In fact, the grant itself has not survived, its only source being an early 8th-century hagiography of the Northumbrian bishop Wilfrid ‚Äì Vita Sancti Wilfrithi ‚Äì by Stephen of Ripon (also known was Eddius Stephanus).Colgrave, Bertram, ed. and trans. (1927). The Life of Bishop Wilfrid by Eddius Stephanus. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press There is no reference to Amounderness in this text, merely to lands \\"iuxta Rippel\\" (next to the Ribble). The historical misattribution may be due to the 16th-century antiquarian John Leland who cites Hasmundesham (possibly Amounderness) in his Collectanea, originally published in 1632, but does so without proper supporting evidence. Amounderness was granted to Wulfstan I, Archbishop of York in June 934 by √Üthelstan, King of England. Once thought a spoil of battle, the area had in fact been purchased by Aethelstan in 926. According to the grant, the extent of Amounderness was much greater than its present-day counterpart being the land \\"from the sea along the Cocker to the source of that river, from that source straight to another spring which is called in Saxon, Dunshop, thus down the riverlet to the Hodder, in the same direction to the Ribble and thus along that river through the middle of the channel to the sea\\". It is unclear from this description whether Dunshop refers to the westerly tributary of the river (i.e. the Brennand) or the easterly (i.e.. the Whitendale) but this distinction would have significant territorial implications. Less precisely, Ekwall describes the eastern boundary of Amounderness as \\"being formed by the fells on the Yorkshire border\\". This places the boundary within the modern-day Forest of Bowland where Dunsop Bridge sits close to the eastern mouth of the Trough of Bowland that straddles the traditional Lancashire-Yorkshire border. After the Norman conquest of England, this eastern portion of Amounderness became part of the Lordship of Bowland. However, Thorn argues that \\"it was only along the river Hodder on the western and south-western edges of the Forest of Bowland that the division between Amounderness and Craven corresponded in any way to the later boundary between Lancashire and Yorkshire\\". Indeed, he even suggests that Amounderness may have been a \\"subdivision of Craven\\" which he describes as \\"stretching from the Irish Sea over the Pennines to touch the Yorkshire wapentakes of Burghshire and 'Skyrack'\\" ... the area around the headwaters of the rivers Aire and Wharfe and upper Ribblesdale\\". In the 10th century, Amounderness would have been strategically important in terms of the Dublin-York axis. Its strategic importance is mirrored on the east coast by Holderness in the East Riding of Yorkshire. By the 12th century, Amounderness and Bowland had become two distinct and separate Lordships, each centred on its own seigneurial, later royal forest. Geography The hundred of Amounderness corresponds to today's administrative districts of Fylde, Wyre, Preston and part of Ribble Valley (north of the River Ribble and within the historic boundaries of Lancashire). It included Bispham, Blackpool, Broughton-in-Amounderness, Chipping, Cockerham, Garstang, Kirkham, Knott End-on-Sea, Mitton, Pilling, Preesall, Poulton-le-Fylde, Preston, and Ribchester. The name is preserved in the present-day Amounderness Way, which is part of the A585 road that runs between Mains Lane in Thornton and Dock Street in Fleetwood. Amounderness in popular culture In his 1858 novel Mervyn Clitheroe, William Harrison Ainsworth portrays the minor character of the Earl of Amounderness whose \\"sylvan domains ... at Dunton Park ... boasted much noble timber\\". Ainsworth's protagonist Mervyn Clitheroe shoots a buck \\"in the domains of Lord Amounderness.\\"Ainsworth (1858), p.167 Amounderness registration district Amounderness was also the name of a registration district for births, deaths and marriages from 1 April 1935 to 31 March 1974. Previously, since 1837, its parishes were part of Preston Registration District. It consisted of Preston Rural District, Fulwood Urban District and Longridge Urban District, covering an area surrounding (but excluding) Preston that was much smaller than the hundred, including areas south of the Ribble that were outside the hundred. It comprised the civil parishes of Barton, Broughton, Cuerdale, Farington, Fulwood, Goosnargh, Grimsargh, Haighton, Hutton, Lea, Little Hoole, Longton, Much Hoole, Penwortham, Samlesbury, Walton-le-Dale, Whittingham and Woodplumpton (all of which were transferred to Preston and South Ribble registration district in 1974), and Alston, Dilworth, Dutton, Hothersall and Ribchester (which were transferred to Ribble Valley registration district).Amounderness registration district, GENUKI, accessed 15 June 2010 References External links *Map of the Lancashire County Hundreds Category:History of Blackpool Category:History of Preston Category:Hundreds of Lancashire Category:The Fylde Category:English royal forests ","title":"Amounderness Hundred"},{"id":"903965","title":"Nissan Bluebird"},{"id":"903967","text":"Patricia Marwick (n√©e Lee; born 5 November 1953)Birth certificate of Patricia Lee, 5 November 1953, Cowdenbeath District 410/01 0055 ‚Äì National Records of Scotland, commonly known as Tricia Marwick, is a Scottish politician, known for being the 4th Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, and the first woman to hold the post. She served as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) in the first four sessions of the Parliament (1999‚àí2016). She was initially elected from the Mid Scotland and Fife regional list 1999‚àí2007, then as the constituency MSP for Central Fife 2007‚Äì2011, which was renamed Mid Fife and Glenrothes 2011‚àí16. She was elected to Parliament as a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), but she suspended her membership in 2011 upon her election as the 4th Presiding Officer, following the tradition that the Presiding Officer is nonpartisan. She did not rejoin the SNP when she stepped down as an MSP. Background Marwick was born on 5 November 1953 in Cowdenbeath and was brought up in Fife, one of seven siblings. She worked as Public Affairs Officer for Shelter Scotland, a charity for homeless people, from 1992 to 1999. Her niece is Natalie McGarry (the former MP for Glasgow East). Member of the Scottish Parliament In the 1999 Scottish Parliamentary election, Marwick was elected as a member for the Mid Scotland and Fife region. She served on the SNP opposition frontbench team as Deputy Business Manager 1999‚Äì2000, Shadow Minister for Local Government 2004, Business Manager and Chief Whip 2004‚Äì2005 and Shadow Minister for Housing 2005‚Äì2007. Marwick has also served as a member of the Scottish Parliament‚Äôs Standards, Justice and Home Affairs, Equal Opportunities, Local Government and Communities committees and as convenor of the Waverly Railway (Scotland) Bill committee from 2004‚Äì2006. At the 2003 Scottish Parliamentary election she contested the Central Fife seat and, although she narrowly failed to win the seat, she was re-elected to serve as a member for Mid Scotland and Fife. Marwick contested Central Fife again in 2007 and was elected as the constituencies MSP after defeating the Labour incumbent, Christine May, with a majority of 1,166 votes. Following the 2007 election Marwick was appointed as the SNP's representative on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, and oversaw parliamentary access and information issues. Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament In the 2011 election, Marwick was elected for the Mid Fife and Glenrothes constituency, essentially a redrawing of her old Central Fife seat. On 11 May 2011, when Parliament reconvened, Marwick was elected to serve as the 4th Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, having won support from the majority of members in the second round of voting. She became the first woman and second SNP member to serve in the position. In October 2012, Marwick accepted a nomination to join the Privy Council, meaning that she is styled the Rt Hon. Tricia Marwick MSP. Each of the previous Presiding Officers were also appointed to the Privy Council. On 29 May 2015, it was announced that Marwick would step down as Presiding Officer after the 2016 election. After Parliament In June 2016 Marwick revealed that she had turned down an offer to put her name forward for an honour from the Queen. Marwick was announced as the new chair for the NHS Fife board in November 2016, replacing Allan Burns who resigned from the post in August 2016. Her appointment as chair will run from 1 January 2017 until 31 December 2020.

A path starts with the Subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA). Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate that is not already explicitly trusted. For example, in a hierarchical PKI, a certificate chain starting with a web server certificate might lead to a small CA, then to an intermediate CA, then to a large CA whose trust anchor is present in the relying party's web browser. In a bridged PKI, a certificate chain starting with a user at Company A might lead to Company A's CA certificate, then to a bridge CA, then to company B's CA certificate, then to company B's trust anchor, which a relying party at company B could trust. (May 2008), chapter 6., a standardized path validation algorithm for X.509 certificates. defines a standardized path validation algorithm for X.509 certificates, given a certificate path. (Path discovery, the actual construction of a path, is not covered.) The algorithm takes the following inputs: * The certificate path to be evaluated; * The current date/time; * The list of certificate policy object identifiers (OIDs) acceptable to the relying party (or any); * The trust anchor of the certificate path; and * Indicators whether policy mapping is allowed and how/when/whether the \\"any\\" policy OID is to be tolerated. In the standardized algorithm, the following steps are performed for each certificate in the path, starting from the trust anchor. If any check fails on any certificate, the algorithm terminates and path validation fails. (This is an explanatory summary of the scope of the algorithm, not a rigorous reproduction of the detailed steps.) * The public key algorithm and parameters are checked; * The current date/time is checked against the validity period of the certificate; * The revocation status is checked, whether by CRL, OCSP, or some other mechanism, to ensure the certificate is not revoked; * The issuer name is checked to ensure that it equals the subject name of the previous certificate in the path; * Name constraints are checked, to make sure the subject name is within the permitted subtrees list of all previous CA certificates and not within the excluded subtrees list of any previous CA certificate; * The asserted certificate policy OIDs are checked against the permissible OIDs as of the previous certificate, including any policy mapping equivalencies asserted by the previous certificate; * Policy constraints and basic constraints are checked, to ensure that any explicit policy requirements are not violated and that the certificate is a CA certificate, respectively.

Although named after the dale or valley of the River Lune, which runs through the city of Lancaster, for centuries it covered most of the northwestern part of Lancashire around Morecambe Bay, including the detached part around Furness. Ironically, only the detached part of North Lonsdale still remains partly within a British parliamentary constituency under the name of Lonsdale. It is part of the Westmorland and Lonsdale constituency. Lonsdale was not recorded as a hundred in the Domesday Book, but the name does appear, in the returns for Yorkshire, apparently as a manor attached to Cockerham. 'in Lonsdale' has been appended to a number of places within the Lune's watershed. Kirkby Lonsdale, Burton-in-Lonsdale, Thornton-in-Lonsdale retain the name but Middleton, Sedbergh, Ingleton and Newby, near Clapham have previously been recorded with it. Following the creation of the hundred sometime during the late 11th or early 12th centuries, parts of the district were included in Westmorland and others in Craven within the West Riding of Yorkshire. The hundred had been defined by 1168 and the bailiwick was granted to Adam de Kellet (of Nether Kellet) in 1199. Other places in the Lonsdale hundred included Lancaster, Bolton-le-Sands, Barrow-in-Furness, Dalton-in-Furness, Ulverston, and Morecambe. The Furness Peninsula was known as Lonsdale North of the Sands, the major part of which later constituted (from 1894 to 1974) the North Lonsdale Rural District. In 1831, the population of males over twenty years old was given as 10,707, meaning the total population would likely be over 20,000 during that year.

It contains much medieval woodwork and its pulpit is one of the oldest in Kent, dating from the 14th century.photographs of St Mary's church The Higham Village History Group, founded in 1997, is devoted to assembling the history of the villageHigham Village History Group's website Parts of Higham Higham has developed as two parts, the original Saxon village of Higham to the north (now Lower Higham) and a more recent settlement to the south around the main road linking Gravesend to Rochester (Upper Higham), which grew in size and importance during the 1800s. Village facilities The Gardeners Arms Services within the village are centred on the two parts of Higham. Higham (upper) is the larger and is the site of the main parish church of St John's, a post office, a GP's surgery, several pubs, convenience shops, a greengrocer, a fish and chip shop, a Chinese takeaway, a library and an Indian takeaway. Higham (lower) is smaller. It is the location of the original and now redundant St Mary's Church; originally 4 pubs (all closed) The Sun Inn, The Chequers, The Railway Tavern and the Malt Shovel; a garage and Higham railway station. Until recently there was a Post Office and shop serving this area of the village. The village primary school (Higham County Primary), village hall (Higham Memorial Hall), park (Higham Recreation Ground), tennis courts and the Knowle Restaurant are approximately halfway between the two parts of the village on School Lane. Until the 1990s the GP surgery serving the village was also based in this area. Points of interest =The Larkin Memorial= The Larkin Memorial is a needle raised in 1835 to the memory of Charles Larkin (1775‚Äì1833), an auctioneer from Rochester who promoted the Parliamentary reforms of 1832 that gave the vote to every householder whose property rental value was more than ¬£10. It is at the highest spot at Higham, but stands almost hidden from sight. By 1860 this unusual concrete monument was in danger of collapse, but was repaired in 1869 after local newspaper reports about its condition. It was renovated again in 1974. =Gad's Hill= Gad's Hill Place, the death place of Charles Dickens. Gad's Hill was once notorious as a haunt of robbers. As far back as 1558 there was a ballad entitled The Robbers of Gad's Hill. In William Shakespeare's play Henry IV, Part 1 Falstaff and his cronies organise a highway robbery at Gad's Hill, but Prince Hal and Poins divest them of their ill-gotten gains. Gad's Hill PlaceGad's Hill Place was once the home of Charles Dickens, who bought it in 1856 for ¬£1,790 and died there in 1870. In its garden once stood a Swiss chalet in which Dickens would compose his works. Rochester Dickens Fellowship.

There are waymarked walking trails across the marshes.Higham Parish Council Communications * Canal: The Thames and Medway Canal now terminates at Higham. Opened 1824, the canal used to connect the Thames at Gravesend to the Medway at Strood. It lost the second half of its route c. 1847 when the railway took over the Higham and Strood canal tunnel, but continued to operate from Gravesend to Higham until 1934.One leg in the water. Accessed 31 August 2006. Description of Higham and Strood tunnel in 1847. It is now disused but there are plans to restore it for leisure use. Canal Road which runs beside it is used by National Cycle Route 1 (between Gravesend and Medway). * Railways: Higham railway station is located in Higham (lower), near the entrance to the former canal tunnel. It is served by the North Kent Line. This section of the line was closed throughout 2004, to allow the chalk tunnel to be completely relined after a series of roof falls.Commuting cut as tunnels reopened BBC News 17 January 2005. Accessed 2006-07-31. * Roads: The main A226 road between Gravesend and Rochester runs to the south of Higham village. Other transport issues relating to Higham centre on a proposed new Lower Thames Crossing through Shorne Wood Country Park being reconsidered in 2013 and a new Thames Estuary Airport nearby on the Isle of Grain. Demographics At the 2001 UK census, the parish of Higham had 3,471 residents and 1,580 households. For every 100 females, there were 92.5 males. The age distribution was 5% aged 0‚Äì4 years, 13% aged 5‚Äì15 years, 8% aged 16‚Äì24 years, 24% aged 25‚Äì44 years, 31% aged 45‚Äì64 years and 19% aged 65 years and over.

Purpose-built from 1447 to 1452 and opened in 1454, and named after the local aristocrat Malatesta Novello, it is significant for being the first civic library in Europe, i.e. belonging to the commune rather than the church or a noble family, and open to the general public. The library was inscribed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2005.  History and influence  The building and creation of the library was commissioned by the Lord of Cesena, Malatesta Novello. Construction was directed by Matteo Nuti from Fano (a pupil of Leon Battista Alberti) and lasted from 1447 to 1452. At Novello's direction, the books were owned by the commune of Cesena, not the monastery or the family. Because of this governing structure, the collection was not dispersed like many monastic libraries. In 2005 UNESCO included the Library in the Memory of the World Programme Register.  Facility  Entrance to the aula (Aula del Nuti). The Malatestiana Library is the only one in the world of the so-called humanistic-conventual type, which blends humanistic principles with architecture otherwise reserved for religious buildings, and has preserved its structure, fittings and codexes since its opening more than 550 years ago. The main doorway was the work of sculptor Agostino di Duccio (1418‚Äì1481). The walnut door at the main entrance dates back to 1454 and was carved by the artist Cristoforo from San Giovanni in Persiceto. Inside, the library features geometric design, typical of the early Italian Renaissance style. The aula has the layout of a basilica (reflecting the importance of the library as a \\"temple of culture\\"), with three naves divided by ten rows of white columns made from local stone; there are eleven bays in each aisle, which are pole vaulted. The central nave is barrel vaulted and ends with a rose under which is the gravestone of Malatesta Novello. The fittings are composed of 58 desks, with coat of arms at the sides. The light comes in through the 44 Venetian style windows, which were purpose designed to provide ideal lighting for reading.  Holdings  A medieval manuscript The library has over 400,000 books, including over 340 codices covering various fields such as religion, Greek and Latin classics, sciences and medicine, and about 3,200 manuscripts from the 16th century. The oldest manuscript in the library is a copy of Isidore's Etymologiae.

Biography He was born at Burgos. He was admitted a Jesuit in 1612, and afterwards sent on mission work to Chile and Peru, where he became rector of the college of Cuenca. In 1639 he accompanied Pedro Teixeira in his second exploration of the Amazon, in order to take scientific observations, and draw up a report for the Spanish government. The journey lasted ten months; and on the explorer's arrival in Bel√©m, Acu√±a prepared his narrative, while awaiting a ship for Europe. The king of Spain, Philip IV, received the author coldly, and, it is said even tried to suppress his book, fearing that the Portuguese, who had just revolted from Spain (1640), would profit by its information. After occupying the positions of procurator of the Jesuits at Rome and censor (calificador) of the Spanish Inquisition at Madrid, Acu√±a returned to South America, where he died, probably soon after 1675.

When an oil spill affects penguins they have in the past been sometimes dressed in knitted sweaters, supposedly to stop them from poisoning themselves by ingesting the oil during preening, and to keep them warm, since the spilled oil destroys their natural oils. The sweaters are removed and discarded as soon as the penguins can be washed.  History  The project originated with the Phillip Island Nature Park oil spill of January 2000 and was successfully completed, but the knitting pattern and call for volunteers to donate remained available online. Instead of the 100 or so sweaters needed, thousands were sent. The extra sweaters were stockpiled by the Tasmanian Conservation Trust. As of 2014, the Australia-based Penguin Foundation is still accepting handmade sweaters but no longer uses these for penguin rehabilitation. Instead, these sweaters are used to dress toy penguins which are then sold to raise money for the foundation. After a 2011 oil spill in New Zealand, a local yarn shop put out the call for penguin jumpers, and supplied a pattern. Jumpers were received from all over the world. However, those cleaning and rehabilitating the penguins affected said they neither used nor requested the jumpers: heat lamps were used to keep cleaned penguins warm. Once they are cleaned, there is little danger of them ingesting oil when preening ‚Äì one of the rationales given for penguin sweaters ‚Äì and sweaters may in fact do more harm than good to the penguins. A penguin wetsuit has been made for a penguin who lost his feathers,BBC video and similar garments are being made for battery chicken rehabilitation.  Controversy and potential risks  The use of penguin sweaters has been criticized as a potential risk to the health of the penguins, as wearing foreign garments can cause additional stress to the penguins and adversely affect their health. Instead, some wildlife rescues use heat lamps to help regulate the temperature of the birds and prevent excessive preening. The International Bird Rescue does not use penguin sweaters or any bird sweaters, because of the dangers of placing a garment on the birds that presses the oil against their skin and prevents the fumes from the oil from dissipating. Another potential risk of using penguin sweaters is that handling or wearing foreign materials can cause additional stress to the penguins. Peter Dann, of the Philip Island Nature Park, stated that the Little Penguins dealt with by Philip Island Nature Park have different needs than the African Penguins International Bird Rescue, and that there were comparable rates of success for rehabilitating Little Penguins with sweaters and African Penguins with heat lamps.

Overview The IBM 2250 Graphics Display Unit was announced with System/360 in 1964. A complete 2250 III system with controller cost around $280,000 in 1970, though up to 4 displays could share a single controller, reducing the cost per display by up to 40%. A display list of line segments (vectors) on a 1024 by 1024 grid was stored in computer's memory or an optional buffer on the 2250 and repainted on the 2250's CRT up to 40 times per second. The computer altered the display by changing the display list. Characters were built of line segments specified by display list subroutines. Thus any character set or font could be displayed, although fonts were generally extremely simplified for performance reasons. An optional character-generator feature on all models provided predefined fonts of 63 characters to simplify display of alphanumeric information. The 2250 was housed in a desk with an alphanumeric (QWERTY) keyboard and a separate programmed function keyboard which had keys, indicator lights and switches. A plastic overlay label could be placed over the function keyboard. Punches on the top edge of the overlay could be sensed by the computer so the keys, lights and switches could be reprogrammed simply by changing overlays. The 2250s CRT measured 21\\" diagonal, but the useful display area was 12 inch by 12 inch. A light pen was provided as a pointing device, serving the function of the modern computer mouse. An IBM 2285 Display Copier could be attached to the 2250 to provide 8¬Ω by 11 inch hard copy of the display contents under operator control. An IBM 2280 Film Recorder or IBM 2282 Film Recorder/Scanner could be attached to a 2840 control unit providing for output or input/output to photographic negative. There were four models of 2250: * Model 1 ‚Äì attached directly to a System/360 via a selector or multiplexor channel. * Model 2 ‚Äì attached via a 2840-1 control unit. A 2840 could attach up to four 2250s and provided buffering and a character generator. * Model 3 ‚Äì attached via a 2840-2 control unit. * Model 4 ‚Äì attached to an IBM 1130 minicomputer via the storage access channel (SAC). The 1130 could run either as a standalone processor or as a front-end processor connected to a remote System/360.

Operational command of Allied forces (including US forces) in the CBI was officially the responsibility of the Supreme Commanders for South East Asia or China. However, US forces in practice were usually overseen by General Joseph Stilwell, the Deputy Allied Commander in China; the term \\"CBI\\" was significant in logistical, material and personnel matters; it was and is commonly used within the US for these theaters. U.S. and Chinese fighting forces in the CBI included the Chinese Expeditionary Force, the Flying Tigers, transport and bomber units flying the Hump, including the Tenth Air Force, the 1st Air Commando Group, the engineers who built the Ledo Road, the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional), popularly known as \\"Merrill's Marauders\\", and the 5332d Brigade, Provisional or 'Mars Task Force', which assumed the Marauders' mission.  U.S. strategy for China  Japanese policy towards China had long been a source of international controversy. Western powers had exploited China through the open door policy, advocated by United States diplomat William Woodville Rockhill, while Japan intervened more directly, creating the puppet-state of Manchukuo. By 1937, Japan was engaged in a full- scale war of conquest in China. The infamous Rape of Nanking galvanized Western opinion and led to direct financial aid for the Kuomintang (Nationalists) and increasing economic sanctions against Japan. In 1941, the U.S. made a series of decisions to support China in its war with Japan: Lend Lease supplies were provided after President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced the defense of China to be vital to the defense of the United States. Over the summer, as Japan moved south into French Indo-China, the U.S., Britain and the Netherlands instituted an oil embargo on Japan, cutting off 90% of its supplies. The embargo threatened the operations of the Kwantung Army, which had over a million soldiers deployed in China. Japan responded with a tightly co-ordinated offensive on December 7/8, simultaneously attacking Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, Malaya, Singapore, Hong Kong, Guam, Wake Island, and Thailand. Japan cut off Allied supplies to China that had been coming through Burma. China could be supplied only by flying over the Himalaya mountains (\\"The Hump\\") from India,Bliss K. Thorne, The Hump: The Great Military Airlift of World War II (1965) or capturing territory in Burma and building a new road‚Äîthe Ledo Road.Michael Schaller, The U.S. Crusade in China, 1938‚Äì1945 (1982)Barbara W.

Its naval base could not defend its conquests, and its industrial base could not strengthen the navy. To cut off China from Allied aid, it went into Burma, captured Rangoon on 8 March 1942, cutting the Burma Road lifeline to China. Moving north the Japanese took Tounggoo, Burma, then captured Lashio in upper Burma on 29 April. The British, primarily concerned with India, looked to Burma as the main theater of action against Japan and wanted Chinese troops to fight there.Donovan Webster, The Burma Road: The Epic Story of the China‚ÄìBurma‚ÄìIndia Theater in World War II (2003) The United States conjured up visions of millions of Chinese soldiers who would hold the Japanese then throw them back, while providing close-in airbases for a systematic firebombing of Japanese cities. The overland supply route from India to China had to go through Burma. Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek realized it was all fantasy. On the other hand, there were vast sums of American dollars available if he collaborated. He did so and managed to feed his starving soldiers, but they were so poorly equipped and led that offensive operations against the Japanese in China were impossible. However, Chiang did release two Chinese armies for action in Burma under Stilwell. They were smashed by the Japanese and Stilwell, on foot, barely escaped to India; the recovery of Burma and construction of the Ledo Road to supply China via Burma became an obsession for Stilwell.Tuchman, Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911‚Äì45 (1971) ch. 12‚Äì14 > \\"On April 14, 1942, William Donovan, as Coordinator of Information > (forerunner of the Office of Strategic Services), activated Detachment 101 > for action behind enemy lines in Burma.

Allied command structure =U.S. and Allied land forces= Chinese M4A4 Sherman in the CBI Battlefield US forces in the CBI were grouped together for administrative purposes under the command of General Joseph \\"Vinegar Joe\\" Stilwell. However, unlike other combat theaters, for example the European Theater of Operations, the CBI was never a \\"theater of operations\\" and did not have an overall operational command structure. Initially U.S. land units were split between those who came under the operational command of the India Command under General Sir Archibald Wavell, as the Commander-in-Chief in India, and those in China, which (technically at least) were commanded by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek,Chapter XIX: The Second Front and the Secondary War The CBI: January‚ÄìMay 1944. The Mounting of the B-29 Offensive in Maurice Matloff References Page 442 as the Supreme Allied Commander in China. However, Stilwell often broke the chain of command and communicated directly with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff on operational matters. This continued after the formation of the South East Asia Command (SEAC) and the appointment of Admiral Lord Mountbatten as Supreme Allied Commander. When joint allied command was agreed upon, it was decided that the senior position should be held by a member of the British military because the British dominated Allied operations on the South-East Asian Theatre by weight of numbers (in much the same way as the US did in the Pacific Theater of Operations). Admiral Lord Mountbatten was appointed as the Supreme Allied Commander of South-East Asia forces in October 1943. Gen. Stilwell, who also had operational command of the Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC), a US-Chinese formation, was to report in theory to Gen. George Giffard ‚Äì commander of Eleventh Army Group ‚Äì so that NCAC and the British Fourteenth Army, under the command of General William Slim, could be co-ordinated. However, in practice, Gen. Stilwell never agreed to this arrangement. Stilwell was able to do this because of his multiple positions within complex command structures, including especially his simultaneous positions of Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia, and Chief of Staff to Chinese leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. As SEAC's deputy leader, Stilwell was Giffard's superior, but as operational commander of NCAC, Giffard was Stilwell's superior. As the two men did not get on, this inevitably lead to conflict and confusion. Eventually at a SEAC meeting to sort out the chain of command for NCAC, Stilwell astonished everyone by saying \\"I am prepared to come under General Slim's operational control until I get to Kamaing\\". Although far from ideal, this compromise was accepted. Although Stilwell was the control and co- ordinating point for all command activity in the theater, his assumption of personal direction of the advance of the Chinese Ledo forces into north Burma in late 1943 meant that he was often out of touch with both his own headquarters and with the overall situation. Not until late 1944, after Stilwell was recalled to Washington, was the chain of command clarified. His overall role, and the CBI command, was then split among three people: Lt Gen. Raymond Wheeler became Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia; Major- General Albert Wedemeyer became Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek, and commander of US Forces, China Theater (USFCT). Lt Gen. Daniel Sultan was promoted, from deputy commander of CBI to commander of US Forces, India‚ÄìBurma Theater (USFIBT) and commander of the NCAC. The 11th Army Group was redesignated Allied Land Forces South East Asia (ALFSEA), and NCAC was decisively placed under this formation. However, by the time the last phase of the Burma Campaign began in earnest, NCAC had become irrelevant, and it was dissolved in early 1945. =U.S. Army and Allied Air Forces= Fourteenth Air Force's 341st Bombardment Group (Medium) After consultation among the Allied governments, Air Command South-East Asia was formed in November 1943 to control all Allied air forces in the theater, with Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse as Commander-in-Chief. Under Peirse's deputy, USAAF Major General George E. Stratemeyer, Eastern Air Command (EAC) was organized in 1943 to control Allied air operations in Burma, with headquarters in Calcutta.Roll of Honour, Britain at War, The Air Forces in Burma http://www.roll-of- honour.org.uk/Cemeteries/Rangoon_Memorial/html/air_forces_in_burma.htm Unlike the strained relations and confusion encountered in coordinating Allied ground force commands, air force operations in the CBI proceeded relatively smoothly. Relations improved even further after new U.S. military aid began arriving, together with capable USAAF officers such as Brigadier General William D. Old of CGI Troop Carrier Command, and Colonels Philip Cochran and John R. Alison of the 1st Air Commando Group.Masters, John. The Road Past Mandalay, Bantam Press (1979), pp. 146‚Äì148 and 308‚Äì309 Within Eastern Air Command, Air Marshal Sir John Baldwin commanded the Third Tactical Air Force, originally formed to provide close air support to the Fourteenth Army. Baldwin was later succeeded by Air Marshal Sir Alec Coryton. U.S. Brigadier-General Howard C. Davidson and later Air Commodore F. J. W. Mellersh commanded the Strategic Air Force. In the new command, various units of the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Tenth Air Force worked side-by-side. In the autumn of 1943 SEAAC had 48 RAF and 17 USAAF squadrons; by the following May, the figures had risen to 64 and 28, respectively. At Eastern Air Command, Gen. Stratemeyer had a status comparable to that of Stilwell.Air of Authority ‚Äì A History of RAF Organisation: Overseas Commands ‚Äì Iraq, India and the Far East Coordinating the efforts of the various allied air components while maintaining relations with diverse command structures proved a daunting task. Part of Stratemeyer's command, the Tenth Air Force, had been integrated with the RAF Third Tactical Air Force in India in December 1943 and was tasked with a number of roles in support of a variety of allied forces. Another component, the US Fourteenth Air Force in China, was under the jurisdiction of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek as China theater commander. Although the India-China Division of the AAF's Air Transport Command received its tonnage allocations from Stratemeyer as Stilwell's deputy, ICD reported directly to Headquarters ATC in Washington, D.C. In the spring of 1944, with the arrival of command B-29s in the theater, another factor would be added to air force operations. XX Bomber Command of the Twentieth Air Force was tasked with the strategic bombing of Japan under Operation Matterhorn, and reported directly to the JCS in Washington, D.C. However, XX Bomber Command remained totally dependent on Eastern Air Command for supplies, bases, ground staff, and infrastructure support. After a period of reshuffling, Eastern Air Command's air operations began to show results. In August 1944, Admiral Mountbatten noted in a press conference that EAC fighter missions had practically swept the Japanese air force from Burmese skies. Between the formation of SEAAC in November 1943, and the middle of August 1944, American and British forces operating in Burma destroyed or damaged more than 700 Japanese aircraft with a further 100 aircraft probably destroyed.Mountbatten, Admiral Lord Louis, Address to the Press, August 1944 http://www.burmastar.org.uk/aug44mountbatten.htm This achievement considerably reduced dangers to Air Transport Command cargo planes flying in support of the Hump airlift operation. By May 1944, EAC resupply missions in support of the Allied ground offensive had carried 70,000 tons of supplies and transported a total of 93,000 men, including 25,500 casualties evacuated from the battle areas. These figures did not include tonnage flown in the Hump airlift missions to China.

Timeline * Early 1942 Stilwell was promoted to lieutenant general and tasked with establishing the CBI. * 25 February 1942 Stilwell arrived in India by which time Singapore and Burma had both been invaded by the Japanese Army. * 10 March 1942 Stilwell is named Chief of Staff of Allied armies in the Chinese theatre of operations. * 19 March 1942 Stilwell's command in China is extended to include the Chinese 5th and 6th Armies operating in Burma after Chiang Kai-shek gave his permission. * 20 March 1942 Chinese troops under Stilwell engage Japanese forces along the Sittang River in Burma. * 9 April 1942 Claire Chennault inducted into U.S. Army as a colonel, bringing the AVG Flying Tigers squadrons under Stilwell's nominal authority. * 16 April 1942 7,000 British soldiers, and 500 prisoners and civilians were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division at Yenangyaung. * 19 April 1942 The 113th Regiment of the Chinese Expeditionary Force's New 38th Division led by General Sun Li-jen attacked and defeated the encircling Japanese troops rescuing the encircled British troops and civilians. This is historically called Battle of Yenangyaung. * 2 May 1942 The commander of Allied forces in Burma, General Harold Alexander, ordered a general retreat to India. Stilwell left his Chinese troops and began the long evacuation with his personal staff (he called it a \\"walk out\\") to India. * Most of the Chinese troops, who were supposed to be under Stilwell's command, were deserted in Burma without knowledge of the retreat. Under Chiang Kai-shek they made a hasty and disorganised retreat to India. Some of them tried to return to Yunnan through remote mountainous forests and out of these, at least half died. * 24 May 1942 Stilwell arrived in Delhi. * New Delhi and Ramgarh became the main training centre for Chinese troops in India. Chiang Kai-shek gave Stilwell command of what was left of the 22nd and 38th Divisions of the Chinese Army. * 1 December 1942 British General Sir Archibald Wavell, as Allied Supreme Commander South East Asia, agreed with Stilwell to make the Ledo Road an American operation.Adrian Fort, Archibald Wavell: The Life and Death of the Imperial Servant (2009) * August 1943 US creates a jungle commando unit, similar to the Chindits, to be commanded by Major General Frank Merrill; it is informally called \\"Merrill's Marauders\\".Edward Young, Merrill's Marauders (2009) * Exhaustion and disease led to the early evacuation of many Chinese and American troops before the coming assault on Myitkyina.assault on Myitkyina town * 21 December Stilwell assumed direct control of operations to capture Myitkyina, having built up forces for an offensive in Northern Burma. * 24 February 1944 Merrill's Marauders, attacked the Japanese 18th Division in Burma. This action enabled Stilwell to gain control of the Hakawing Valley. * 17 May 1944 British general Slim in command of the Burma Campaign handed control of the Chindits to Stilwell. * 17 May 1944 Chinese troops, with the help of Merrill's Marauders, captured Myitkina airfield. * 3 August 1944 Myitkina fell to the Allies. The Marauders had advanced 750 miles and fought in five major engagements and 32 skirmishes with the Japanese Army. They lost 700 men, only 1,300 Marauders reached their objective and of these, 679 had to be hospitalized. This included General Merrill who had suffered a second-heart attack before going down with malaria. * Some time before 27 August 1944, Mountbatten supreme allied commander (SEAC) ordered General Stilwell to evacuate all the wounded Chindits. * During 1944 the Japanese in Operation Ichi-Go overran US air bases in eastern China. Chiang Kai-shek blamed Stilwell for the Japanese success, and pressed the US high command to recall him. * October 1944 Roosevelt recalled Stilwell, whose role was split (as was the CBI): ** Lieutenant General Raymond Wheeler became Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia. ** Major General Albert Wedemeyer became Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek and commander of the U.S. Forces, China Theater (USFCT).Albert C.

The house was rebuilt in the 1770s from an earlier house built in 1734. The house is a Grade I listed building. The garden is well known for its historic rare plant collection. History The estate of Wormleybury, originally known as Wormley Bury, was one of several estates with which King Harold endowed Waltham Abbey. A house was built on the site in 1525, just north of the present building. The first houses's owner was Edward Sharnebrook. Wormley Bury was in the Abbey‚Äôs possession until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, between 1536 and 1541. Afterwards, the estate was granted to Edward North and his heirs. North sold the manor to Elizabeth Woodcliffe. The house was subsequently bequeathed to William Woodcliffe, and it later passed to many owners in the next two centuries. The sixteenth century house was replaced by a new house built in 1734, by John Deane for Alexander Hume. (1693‚Äì1765). Sir Abraham Hume, 1st Baronet (1703‚Äì1772), rebuilt Wormleybury house in the 1770s. The present house was an expansion of the earlier house built in 1734 for his older brother, Alexander Hume. Abraham Hume inherited the estate from Alexander when he died in 1765. Architect, Robert Mylne supervised the house remodel from 1767 to 1769, and from 1781 to 1782, after Abraham's son, Sir Abraham Hume, 2nd Baronet (1749‚Äì1838) inherited the estate after his father's death in 1772. The interior decoration of the house was supervised by Robert Adam from 1777 to 1779. Adam also designed the garden buildings for the estate. The drawing room has painted roundels by Angelica Kauffman. The Wormleybury estate passed to the male children of Lady Brownlow (Viscount Alford and the Hon. Charles Henry Cust), after Lord Hume died without male issue in 1838. The estate passed through several owners, and is currently divided into flats. The house is a Grade I listed building. Park and garden The rosa odorata \\"Hume's Blush Tea-Scented\\" Lord Hume (1749‚Äì1838) and his wife, Lady Amelia (1751‚Äì1809) were well known among leading horticulturalists during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, both in England and abroad. With the help of their gardener, James Mean, they established many exotic plant species in the gardens and greenhouses at Wormleybury. They introduced into England, between 1785 and 1825, a large collection of rare plants, primarily from India and the Far East. Botanist James Edward Smith, along with other notable botanists at the time, discussed the Humes's contribution to English horticulture in their publications. Many new plant species were first cultivated at Wormleybury after they arrived in England. According to Smith, in his volume, Exotic Botany, \\"Dr. Roxburgh ... has sent Lady Hume a fine young tree of this species, Dellinia speciosa, Malabar, which is now in a very thriving state. It is presumed to be the first ever brought alive to Europe\\". The Humes introduced the first white pomegranate (Punica granatum fl. Alba) in England in 1796, and the 'Maiden's Blush' (Camellia japonica) and the large Mandarin orange (Citrus nobilis) in 1805. The Hume's most important introduction, the first Tea Rose from China, 'Hume's Blush Tea Scented China Rose' (Rosa odorata) was planted at Wormleybury in 1810. Wormleybury is listed Grade II in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

He lusts after the beautiful but shallow Lana (Barbara Bach), who is the mate of Tonda (John Matuszak), their tribe's physically imposing bullying leader and brutish instigator. After being banished along with his friend Lar (Dennis Quaid), Atouk falls in with a band of assorted misfits, among them the comely Tala (Shelley Long) and the elderly blind man Gog (Jack Gilford). The group has ongoing encounters with hungry dinosaurs, and rescues Lar from a \\"nearby ice age\\", where they encounter an abominable snowman. In the course of these adventures they discover sedative drugs, fire, invent cooking, music, weapons, and learn how to walk fully upright. Atouk uses these advancements to lead an attack on Tonda, overthrowing him and becoming the tribe's new leader. He rejects Lana and takes Tala as his mate, and they live happily ever after.

The river and fishing lake scene was shot in the Mexican state of Durango, and some scenes were filmed at the Churubusco Studios in Mexico City. The film features stop motion animated dinosaurs constructed by Jim Danforth, including a Tyrannosaurus Rex which in one scene becomes intoxicated by a cannabis-type drug, animated by Randall W. Cook.Pettigrew, p. 114. Danforth was a major participant in the special effects sequences, but left the film \\"about two-thirds of the way\\" (his words) through the work because the Directors Guild of America prohibited his contracted on-screen credit, co- direction with Carl Gottlieb. Consequently, Danforth's name does not appear on the film.Pettigrew, p. 109. The film's dialog is almost entirely in \\"caveman\\" language, such as: * \\"alunda\\" - love * \\"bobo\\" - friend * \\"haraka\\" - fire * \\"macha\\" - monster * \\"aiyee\\" - help * \\"ya\\" - yes * \\"nya\\" - no/not * \\"ool\\" - food * \\"pooka\\" - broken/pain * \\"ugh\\" - like * \\"zug zug\\" - sex/mate * \\"kuda\\" - come * \\"caca\\" - shit * \\"guwi\\" - out to get * \\"gluglug\\" - drowned At some showings audiences were issued a translation pamphlet for 30 \\"caveman words.\\" The only English dialog present is used for comedic effect, when it is spoken by a caveman played by Evan Kim who speaks modern English but is understood by none of the other characters. Being a Korean caveman, by speaking English, he appears to be more advanced than the rest. At her audition, Long said she did not speak any English, but responded to everything with grunts. Barbara Bach and Ringo Starr first met on the set of Caveman, and they married just over a year later. Home media The film was released on Region 1 DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on June 4, 2002. It was then released on February 17, 2015 on Blu-ray Disc by Olive Films. Reception Critical reception was mostly negative. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 26% based on reviews from 19 critics. Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 stars out of a possible 4. The cast was \\"interesting\\", he wrote, but the main failing of Caveman was it being a spoof with \\"no popular original material for it to satirize. There has never been a really successful movie set in prehistoric times.\\" Ebert and Gene Siskel both gave the film a negative \\"don't see it\\" review on their TV show but softened their criticism somewhat by noting that its dinosaur-related sequences were hilarious. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film was \\"dopey, but it's also lots of fun\\", and that the real star was the special-effects dinosaur. Caveman was not a box- office success.

Even though the wine made from these grapes does not possess the distinctive flavor and the overall structure of other types of Cabernet wines, it does carry their fruitful essence.Ruby Cabernet profile Snooth. Retrieved on 2010-03-05 The grape for this type of red wine was developed for California's hot climate, specially for regions such as the San Joaquin and the Napa Valleys.Napa Valley Cabernet Retrieved on 2010-03-05 Ruby Cabernet has improved the quality of the bulk wines produced in these areas thanks to its natural, special acidity. History Dr. Harold Olmo, creator of Ruby Cabernet. Ruby Cabernet is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan created in 1936 by Dr Harold Olmo at UC Davis in California. The intention was to combine Carignan's heat tolerance with Cabernet Sauvignon's quality, like the Cinsaut x Pinot noir cross that led to Pinotage a few years previously. Wine regions =Argentina= A little is grown in Argentina for blending into bulk wines. =Australia= Small amounts are grown in the Hunter Valley and Murray- Darling region, disappearing into nondescript blends. However a few producers take the variety seriously. Andrew McPherson in Victoria uses the variety in several export wines f.x Full Fifteen exported to England and Denmark. =Brazil= Vale do S√£o Francisco winery in Pernambuco, Brazilian Northeast region, successfully grows the variety and produces the wine Botticelli Cole√ß√£o Ruby Cabernet. Vin√≠cola Campos de Cima in Itaqui, Campanha Ga√∫cha, grows the grape and produces a 100% varietal of the wine Ruby Cabernet. =Mexico= Valle De Guadalupe, Baja California (near Ensenada) produces a very nice variety and quality wines. Included is Cabernet Franc - Malbec/Ruby Cabernet. Aguascalientes is also another wine region where wines with this grape are produced. =Chile= Some Ruby Cabernet is supposedly grown in Chile, but few wines will admit to it on the label. =Israel= A little Ruby Cabernet is used by the Tishbi winery in Zichron Ya'akov. Some 17 tons were harvested in 2012.[\\"Israel Wine board\\"] http://www.wineboard.co.il/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/BatzirMale2012.pdf =South Africa= For a while Ruby Cabernet was thought to hold a lot of promise for the hotter regions of South Africa, but in practice problems with fruit set have limited its success. It is successfully grown in the Robertson district, and forms the main ingredient of the Van Loveren \\"River Red\\" blend. =USA= Ruby Cabernet is mostly planted in California, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley where it adds colour and backbone to bulk wines. Vineyards where farming techniques are employed to maximize quality however can produce wines with exceptional aroma, flavor, and mouth feel. Vine and Viticulture Carignan The vine is very drought resistant, and stands up well to high winds. Poor fruit set has been a problem in South Africa, and it is vulnerable to powdery mildew. In California's San Joaquin Valley, vineyards should limit irrigation, thin crop, and expose fruit to the sun to maximize wine quality. =Vineyard ground= The vineyards on which grapes for Ruby Cabernet are grown, are seat on vigorous grounds filled with deep clay loam. The canopies on these vineyards are usually quite open and not completely erected. The spacing below the vineyard row is normally of about seven to eight feet for optimal vertical shoot positioning. In case of vineyards which are quadrilateral and divided in a horizontal way, the space must be of about six to seven feet.University of California. \\"Ruby Cabernet Viticulture\\" 2010-03-05.

He was instrumental in describing the flora of the west of North America, then very poorly known; he was particularly active in the Rocky Mountains and northern Mexico, one of his constant companions being another German-American, the botanical illustrator Paulus Roetter. Biography =Origins= George Engelmann was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, the oldest of thirteen children, nine of whom reached maturity. His father, Julius Bernhardt Engelmann, was a member of a family from which for several successive generations were chosen ministers for the Reformed Church at Bacharach-on-the-Rhine. Julius was a graduate of the University of Halle, and was also educated for the ministry, but he devoted his life to education. He established a school for young women in Frankfurt, which were rare at the time. George Engelmann's mother, Julie Antoinette, was the only daughter of Antoinette Andr√© and George Oswald May. The latter, in his earlier years, was an artist of note at the Court of Weimar. Julie Antoinette was Julius Engelmann's coadjutor in the school for young women, and its success was largely due to her management and tact. His uncle, Friedrich Theodor, a German pioneer of Illinois, was an early American viticulturist. =Education= George Engelmann received his early education at the gymnasium in Frankfurt. According to himself, he first became interested in plants around age 15. He voluntarily devoted much of his time after school duties to studying history, modern languages, and drawing. Assisted by a scholarship (founded by the ‚ÄúReformed Congregation of Frankfurt‚Äù), in 1827 he began to study sciences at the University of Heidelberg, where he met Karl Schimper and Alexander Braun. With the latter especially an intimate friendship and correspondence were preserved unbroken until Braun's death in 1877. He also retained friendship with Schimper. However, that erratic genius abandoned botany despite obtaining a remarkable grasp of philosophical botany and laying the foundations of phyllotaxy. In 1828 young Engelmann's studies at Heidelberg were interrupted by his having joined the students in a political demonstration. He thereupon left Heidelberg and entered the University of Berlin, where he stayed for two years. In 1831, he received the degree of MD from the University of W√ºrzburg. His dissertation for the medical degree, more related to botany than to medicine, was published at Frankfurt in 1832 under the title of De Antholysi Prodromus. It was devoted to morphology ‚Äî mainly to the structure of monstrosities and aberrant forms of plants ‚Äî and was illustrated by five plates of figures drawn and transferred to the lithographic stone by the author's own hand. Its subject was so directly in line with that of a treatise on the metamorphosis of plants by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe that it was heartily welcomed by the poet-philosopher, whose own life was then approaching its close. Having received Engelmann's treatise through his correspondent Marianne von Willemer, Goethe inquired after the young author, saying that Engelmann had completely apprehended Goethe's ideas concerning vegetable morphology, and had shown a peculiar genius for their development. So strong was his confidence in Engelmann's ability that he offered to give him his whole store of unpublished notes and sketches. In 1832 Engelmann went to Paris, where he again became associated with Braun, and also with Louis Agassiz. =Emigration to United States= Wishing to visit America, he accepted a proposition from his uncles to become their agent for the purchase of lands in the United States. In September 1832, he sailed from Bremen for Baltimore, Maryland. In addition to his duties assessing land investment opportunities, he also spent time on botanical travels, first visiting Thomas Nuttall in Philadelphia. He then went to St. Louis, Missouri, and from there around to the adjacent states. He settled with his relatives and the lawyer Gustav Koerner on a farm in St. Clair County, Illinois near Belleville for three years. For the purpose of forming a correct judgment of the lands of the new country to which he had come, he made many long, lonesome, and often adventurous horse-back journeys in Illinois, Missouri, and Arkansas. He often suffered sickness and hardship upon those journeys, but he persevered until he finished all the business he had planned to do. He made much use of his scientific, as well as practical, knowledge in the prosecution of that business, doing mineralogical and geological work, but only the botanical notes which he then made were used in his subsequent scientific career. =Medical practice= Having completed his business engagement, in the autumn of 1835 Engelmann moved to St. Louis and established a medical practice. During the three years that had passed since he left his native land the slender means he brought with him became exhausted, and he began the practice of his profession in absolute poverty. To furnish an office he was even obliged to part with his gun and with the faithful horse which had carried him on so many long and lonesome journeys. At that time St. Louis was little more than a frontier trading post, but Engelmann had strong faith in its future greatness, and he lived to see it become one of the chief cities of the United States. In 1836 he founded a German newspaper called Das Westland, which contained valuable articles on life and manners in the United States, and gained a high reputation both in the United States and in Europe. Four years were passed before he had laid the foundation of his medical practice and had earned the means of making a visit to his old German home. In 1840 he returned to Germany, where in Kreuznach he married his cousin Dorothea Horstmann on June 11. (Their son George Julius Engelmann became a noted gynecologist.) They soon returned to America. Upon reaching New York City, Engelmann for the first time met Asa Gray, already the most noted of American botanists, and the friendship between those two eminent men thus begun was broken only by death. This friendship is noteworthy because of the evidently beneficial effect which it had upon botanical science in America. Upon his return to St. Louis with his young wife, Engelmann immediately resumed his medical practice. Then, and long afterward, a large proportion of the inhabitants of St. Louis were of French and German-speaking families, and his familiarity with those languages, as well as with the English, gave him great advantage in extending his practice. Because of this and of his great professional ability, as the years went on he acquired a financial competence that gave him an independence. Never, however, did he take advantage of his success in this respect to lessen his labors, for whenever his medical labors were relaxed his scientific work fully engrossed his attention. The confidence he inspired in his medical clientele was such that as he grew older he could take long vacations and resume his practice almost at will. After 1869, he no longer kept a medical office and attended the few patients he saw in his study. Still, it was always difficult for him to refuse medical aid to those who sought it, and even up to the last year of his life there were old friends to whose families he was the only acceptable medical adviser and whose appeal for aid he could not refuse. Illustrating this fact, as well as Engelmann's energetic manner, his son relates the following incident: ‚ÄúIt was a bitter, sleety winter night, when the ringing of the doorbell awoke me, and I heard an urgent call for father from the messenger of a patient. I would not arouse him, and proposed to go myself; but he had heard all, and, hurrying into his clothes, was ready to go in spite of my remonstrance 'What of the night?' he said, vexed at my interference, 'Am I already useless, to be cast aside? I would rather die in harness than rust out.' So I helped him down the icy steps, through the blinding sleet, into his carriage, and off on his mission of mercy.‚Äù =Botanical studies= Engelmann devoted himself to his medical practice, but in his later years made a specialty of botany. An 1842 monograph on dodders, a very difficult genus to examine, had established his reputation as a botanist. He took several vacations from his medical practice and devoted them all to the gathering of data for his scientific work, the details of which were elaborated at his home. One of these vacations extended from 1856 to 1858, the greater part of the first summer having been spent in botanical work at the Harvard gardens and herbarium in companionship with Asa Gray. Then, with his wife and young son, he visited his native land and other parts of Europe, occupying his time with scientific observation and study. In 1868 Dr. Engelmann and his wife again visited Europe for a year, the son being then in Berlin pursuing his medical studies. These visits to Europe were also the occasions of frequent and familiar personal interviews with men whose names were well known to the scientific world, such as Joseph Dalton Hooker, Alexander Braun, De Bary, Virchow, and others. In 1859, he published Cactaceae of the Boundary which studied cacti on the border of the United States and Mexico. He also made special studies of the pines, rushes, spurges, and other little-known and difficult groups, contributing numerous articles on them to the St. Louis Academy of Sciences, to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and to government reports. Material in his specialties collected by the federal government was sent to him for examination. He was one of the earliest to study the North American vines, and nearly all that is known scientifically of the American species and forms is due to his investigations. His first monograph on The Grape-Vines of Missouri was published in 1860, and his latest on this subject shortly before his death. His two major works on cacti remain important today. He was a founder and longtime president of the St. Louis Academy of Sciences, and encouraged the wealthy St. Louis businessman Henry Shaw to develop his gardens to be of scientific as well as public use; \\"Shaw's Gardens\\" became the Missouri Botanical Garden. On a visit to England in 1857, he had consulted with William Jackson Hooker on the establishment of Shaw's gardens. He was also one of the original founders of the National Academy of Science. =Phylloxera= In 1861, Engelmann had published a pioneering paper in the United States examining plant diseases. It focussed on the grape. He also established an herbarium for 10 species of grape he had discovered. He then played an important, but little known role in rescuing the French wine industry. In the 1870s French vineyards came under attack by a small insect, Phylloxera vastatrix, an aphid-like pest which sucks sap from the roots of grape vines. Growers observed that certain imported American vines resisted this pest, and the French government dispatched a scientist to St. Louis to consult with the Missouri state entomologist and with Engelmann, who had studied American grapes since the 1850s. Engelmann verified that certain living American species had resisted Phylloxera for nearly 40 years. In addition, Vitis riparia, a wild vine of the Mississippi Valley, did not cross pollinate with less resistant species, the cause of previous grafting failures. Engelmann arranged to have millions of shoots and seeds collected and sent to France, where the species proved to be very successful in providing rootstock.Missouri Botanical Garden Bulletin, September/October 2002 =Other fields= While botanical investigations constituted much the greater part of Dr. Engelmann's scientific work, he always had in hand data for other investigations. For example, he began meteorological observations when he first settled at St. Louis, and personally, or by proxy during his absence, he continued them without intermission until his death ‚Äî a longer period, it is believed, than that of similar observations by any one man in America. Engelmann often compared meteorological data with his friend and contemporary Augustus Fendler. The two also collaborated on horticultural experiments on cacti, and frequently corresponded on the matter of specimen collection.William Marriott Canby: An Autobiographie and Some Reminiscences of the Late August Fendler. I. In: Botanical Gazette. Band 10, Nummer 6, 1885, S. 285‚Äì290, (online). Among the animals he studied were tapeworms (Taenia), the opossum, squirrels and mudpuppies (Menobranchus). =Later explorations= The death of his wife on January 29, 1879, greatly affected him. He turned to plants, seeking relief in study, but life and a continuance of its labors seemed to be almost hopeless. His condition changed but little during the remainder of the winter, but when in the spring C. S. Sargent came with the proposition that he should join him in a journey through the forests of the Pacific Coast region he accepted it. That journey, although a difficult one for a man of his age, was of great benefit to him physically. His shattered spirit also was much revived and, among his friends, he resumed and sustained his lifelong habit of cheerfulness of manner. Legacy He is commemorated in the names of several plants, including Engelmann Oak (Quercus engelmannii), Engelmann Spruce (Picea engelmannii), Apache Pine (Pinus engelmannii), and Engelmann's Prickly-pear (Opuntia engelmannii). Engelmann's botanical collection, valuable as containing the original specimens from which many western plants have been named and described, was given to the Missouri Botanical Garden. This gift led to the founding of the Henry Shaw School of Botany as a department of Washington University in St. Louis, where an Engelmann professorship of botany has been established by Shaw in his honor. Engelmann was interred in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.

Local government is administered by Komarnivska city council.Komarnivska city council Its population is approximately . History It was founded in 1324. In the center of town is an old Polish Kostel (Catholic Church), as well as an old wooden Ukrainian Orthodox church complete with ancient icons. The river Vereshytsia flows through the town. The Jewish Hasidic dynasty of Komarno originates from this town, and there was a sizable Jewish community in the town from the 16th century until World War II when they were murdered. Komarno, which until the Partitions of Poland belonged to Ruthenian Voivodeship, received its town charter (Magdeburg rights) in the mid-15th century from King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk. The town was under protection of Voivode Stanislaw de Chodecz, who in 1473 founded here a Roman Catholic church. Komarno was a local center of textile industry. The town was divided into several districts, and remained in private hands of several voivodes. In 1590, it belonged to Jan Ostrorog, the voivode of Pozna≈Ñ, and in the 17th century, it was property of the House of Wi≈õniowiecki. Later on, Komarno belonged to the Ogi≈Ñski family, and Lanckoro≈Ñski family. In the 19th century, when it already was part of Austrian Galicia, the Lanckoro≈Ñski family built here a palace. Last owner of Komarno was Countess Karolina Lanckoro≈Ñska. In 1648, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, Komarno was besieged by the Cossack-Tatar forces. On 8 October 1672 the Battle of Komarno took place here, in which King Jan III Sobieski destroyed a 10,000 strong Tatar unit. In 1918 Komarno returned to Poland, and by 1939, its population was app. 5,000. Until the Invasion of Poland, the town belonged to Lw√≥w Voivodeship. Prior to World War II, the town had a Jewish population of about 2,400. During World War II, the Jewish population was murdered in the town by Germans and their Ukrainian auxiliaries or sent to Belzec to be murdered there. Only a handful of Komarno's Jews survived the Holocaust. Komarno has a former Roman Catholic church (1658), which in 1946 was turned by Soviet authorities into a warehouse. In 1992, Ukrainian government returned the complex to the faithful, but soon afterwards, it was handed over to the local Greek-Catholic community. Among people associated with Komarno are Jan Kilarski (mathematician), Countess Karolina Lanckoronska, linguist Roman Laskowski, historian Jozef Leszczynski, writer Karol Szajnocha.

Poppe is regarded as one of Scandinavia's most experienced and compelling film directors recognized for his work with actors and multi- pronged narratives. His movies are often built around ensemble casts, sharp writing, impressive camera work and an uncanny knack for rhythm and music in the editing. He is best known for directing critically acclaimed films including Hawaii, Oslo (2004), A Thousand Times Good Night (2013) and The King's Choice (2016).  Early life and education  Poppe was born on 24 June 1960 in Oslo to Aase and Per Fr√∏lich Poppe, who was a fashion designer in winter sport clothing. As a child he grew up in Portugal and Norway. He started his career as a photographer for the newspaper Verdens Gang and Reuters, covering domestic news as well as international conflicts. Being hospitalized after an assignment in Colombia he decided to prepare leaving journalism and study filmmaking. He graduated as a cinematographer at Dramatiska Institutet - University College of Film, Radio, Television and Theatre in Stockholm, Sweden in 1991. He have conducted several artistic and directorial research programs between 2001 and 2010. In 2015 Poppe concluded a PhD as a research fellow at the Norwegian Artistic Research Programme and as an Associated Professor at HIL, Lillehammer University College/ The Norwegian Film School. \\"The Subjective Objective\\" is an exploration on how to achieve increased emotionally outcome by the use of a highly personalized and strictly subjectively point of view in conscious narrative film. -Is it possible to achieve a stronger identification, empathy and a greater involvement for the spectator by applying a strict enforcement of the subjective point of view? -A point of view who never allows the filmmaker to show for the spectator more than the film's protagonist are seeing or experiencing at any time. The project developed various measures for an increased empathy with the narrative's protagonist and discuss further elements to be considered for a stronger subjectivity. The key artistic work made as part of the research was the feature movie A Thousand Times Good Night, a dramatization of his experiences as a conflict photographer in Democratic Republic of the Congo and Afghanistan.  Career  Erik Poppe worked as Director of Photography on several features, as well as EGGS (1995) by Bent Hamer. He was awarded with the Kodak Award at the Moscow International Film Festival and won the Cinematographer of the year award in Norway. By receiving the Kodak Award he announced his end of work as Director of Photography. = Oslo Trilogy = Troubled Water (2008, aka: deUSYNLIGE) is the third part of his multi-awarded Oslo Trilogy, after his directorial debut with SCHPAAA (1998, aka Bunch Of Five) and Hawaii, Oslo (2004). Working on the research for Schpaaa; a terrifying look at multi-racial youth gangs in Norway and shot in the style of a documentary, he discovered realities he wanted to adapt into two more movies. Hawaii-Oslo tells a story about a number of people whose fates intertwine, sometimes by accident, during the hottest day of the year in downtown Oslo. Troubled Water is a story about a young man released from prison after serving a sentence for an alleged murder of a child. All of the movies are shoot in the area of Groenland and Grunerloekka in downtown Oslo. \\"The place where we live so close to each other, and know so little about each other.\\" A Thousand Times Good Night (2013, aka: 1000 Times Good Night, Tusen Ganger God Natt) was Poppe's first English-language movie. The film is partly an autobiographical story based on Poppe experiences as a conflict photographer. Poppe switched the lead roles around making the French actress Juliette Binoche as his proxy, and Game of Throne's -Nicolaj Coster-Waldau playing the character based on Poppe's wife. A standing ovation greeted Montreal World Film Festival's world premiere of the film, which went on to earn the Jury's Special Grand Prix. The King's Choice (2016) is based on the true the story about the three dramatic days in April 1940, when Haakon VII of Norway is presented with the monstrous ultimatum from the Germans: surrender or die. With German Air Force and soldiers hunting them down, the royal family is forced to flee from the capital. After three days of desperately trying to evade the Germans, King Haakon makes his final decision, one that may cost him, his family and many Norwegians their lives. The film made records when it opened in Norway by late September 2016 and became the #1 box office hit of the year. The film was Norway's official entry in the best foreign language film category for the 2017 Oscars and made a shortlist nomination for the Oscars. Per Fugelli (1943-2017) was a Norwegian doctor, a professor of social medicine and a forceful voice in the public sphere. Fugelli spent his life addressing questions of freedom and respect, campaigning for rights of the less fortunate. Fugelli was diagnosed with cancer in 2009. In 2015 he said no to further treatment and allowed his close friend, director Erik Poppe to follow him as far as possible on this journey. The result is I DIE (Siste resept) a film about life and how to live it to the very end. In June 2017 it was announced that Erik Poppe had worked for a year on developing a feature film about the 2011 terrorist attack on Ut√∏ya outside Oslo, Norway. The film, entitled U, begins 12 minutes before the first shot on Ut√∏ya as we meet Kaja (18), her little sister, and their friends at summer camp. When the shooting begins panic spreads, and over the next 72 minutes we follow Kaja in her escape ‚Äì minute by minute. She becomes separated from her little sister, and in the search for her she finds other youngsters with different strategies for survival. Some make it, others do not. U July 22 (Ut√∏ya 22.juli) is a fictional account of events which will tell the story from the young people's perspective, based on a series of in-depth interviews conducted with survivors from Ut√∏ya. Some of them was on set behind the camera while filming took place in September 2017 to help give the narrative credibility. Erik Poppe was also the key director for \\"Brigaden\\" (The Brigade) in 2002. A 26 episodes TV-drama for NRK (The Norwegian Broadcasting Corp). Brigaden received the Norwegian \\"Amanda\\" Price for the Best TV-drama in 2003.  Awards  Erik Poppe is the only director to have received the Norwegian National Film Critics' Award four times. Hawaii-Oslo in 2005, Troubled Water in 2009, A Thousand Times Good Night in 2014 and The Kings Choice in 2017 - all movies were also voted as last year's Best Feature. When he received the price for best film in 2014 at The Amanda, he became historical by being the only director to have been nominated for all his feature movies (five movies) in the categories best film or/ and best director at the Amanda, Norway's national film prizes. The King's Choice (\\"Kongens nei\\") was the Amanda jury's clear favorite at 2017's awards as well. Nominated for a record 13 Amandas ‚Äî Norway's national film prizes ‚Äî it snagged eight. Poppe has participated in key festivals, and received prizes such as the Berlinale -Panorama (Schpaaa), The Vesuvio Prize at Napoli International Film Festival, Norwegian entries for best foreign language movie at Oscars, Festroia in Portugal for Best Directing, Silver Dolphin in Festroia, Nordic Ministerie Councils Award for The Best Nordic Feature, ecumenical awards. Troubled Water made history at the Hamptons International Film Festival in 2008 by being the first feature to win both the festival's Golden Starfish for Best Narrative Feature and the Audience Award. Poppe received the Special Golden Angel, the lifetime achievement award, for his work as Outstanding European Film Artist at the 2016 International Film Festival TOFIFEST in Poland. Erik Poppe is co-owner of Paradox Film and the Paradox Group. A series of companies producing features. On his career as a photojournalist: \\"All the actions I undertook back then were driven by the urge to draw attention to the horrors of war. I wanted for my pictures to grab you by the throat, when eating breakfast on a Saturday morning.\\" On working with feature movies: \\"You need to be honest, because this way your audience will be able to identify with the topic and the hero. My role, as an artist, is to prepare a text with open questions and hide the fact that I have an answer key. Questions will provoke audience to discuss the film and seek new perspectives. The film is supposed to make a difference, and maybe offer a therapeutic effect.\\" Filmography *Schpaaa (1998) *Brigaden (TV series 2002 about Norwegian firefighters) *Hawaii, Oslo (2004) *Troubled Water (2008) *A Thousand Times Good Night (2013) *The King's Choice (2016) *I die.

Eagle Vale is located 56 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Campbelltown and is part of the Macarthur region. It is bordered by the suburbs of Eschol Park, Kearns, Raby, Blairmount, Woodbine, St Andrews and Claymore. History Following European settlement, many new settlements were established to the south west of Sydney, to cater for the growing agricultural demands of the growing colony. The land surrounding these settlements were subsequently divided up and given away as land grants to settlers in order to establish farms. One such grant, 100 acres (0.4 km¬≤) worth, was that given to Thomas Clarkson on the western hills of Campbelltown, at the base of what is now called the 'Scenic Hills'. Clarkson, an ex-convict turned businessman and baker, established the property of 'Woodland Grove,' which not only covered modern day Eagle Vale, but most of its surrounding suburbs. After his death in 1826, his property was sold to Jemima Jenkins, a wealthy widow of the founder of the Bank of New South Wales (now Westpac). She renamed the property 'Eagle Farm' and used the address 'Eagle Farm, Eagle Vale.' The name Eagle Vale originated from two creeks that ran through the property, Eagle Creek and Valebrook, the later now being located in the suburb of Eschol Park. (The two creeks were later converted into flood retention basins' and stormwater channels) She later sold a large part of the western side of the property to the Kearns family, who used it to expand the adjacent property of 'Epping Forest.' Once Jenkins died, the land eventually ended up in the ownership of William Fowler, a Campbelltown business man, who again renamed the property, this time to 'Eschol Park,' and the name Eagle Vale eventually fell into a period of disuse. It was not until 1976, when the property of Highlands was being subdivided for suburban residential use that the name of Eagle Vale surfaced once again, to be applied to the new subdivision between the newly developed suburb of Eschol Park and the public housing estate of Claymore. In 1978, the first housing lots were released, and several land releases continued into the 1980s, with some smaller releases continuing into the early 1990s. The relatively low price of the land meant that it quickly attracted first home buyers, often young families. Eagle Vale, much like the rest of Campbelltown area, has often attracted an unfortunate reputation for being a somewhat undesirable suburb, an attitude that is compounded by its proximity to the public housing suburb of Claymore which itself is often negatively perceived. This negative image of Claymore even prompted residents of privately owned houses in the suburb to lobby for the suburb borders to be altered in order to place them into Eagle Vale, which was eventually achieved in 1986. This explains why some of the streets on the eastern side of the suburb have names following Claymore's street naming theme, Great Australian Artists, such as Albert Namatjira, rather than Eagle Vale's theme of minerals and gemstones, such as Emerald, Cameo and Aquamarine. The suburb features several parks and reserves, including Thomas Clarkson Reserve, located on the former route of Eagle Creek, which features the original ornamental pond from the Jenkins estate. Adjacent suburbs also feature parks named after Jemima Jenkins (in Kearns) and William Fowler (in Eschol Park); and Valebrook Reserve, located on the former location of Valebrook Creek. Ivan Milat, the famous \\"Backpacker Murders\\" serial killer and, rapist, now in jail, resided at 22 Cinnabar Street, Eagle Vale. (http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/milat/13.html) Commercial areas Eagle Vale Marketplace is a shopping centre that opened in 1995, featuring a Woolworths supermarket and specialty shops. A police station was added in 2000. Eagle Vale Leisure Centre was opened in 1993 as a multipurpose gym and aquatic centre. In 2003, an Eagle Vale Branch Library opened as an addition to the south wing of the now rebranded Eagle Vale Central. Schools The public high school, Eagle Vale High School opened in 1984 and a private Catholic primary school, Mary Immaculate (formerly St Marys, part of the Mary Immaculate parish) opened in 1986. Population According to the 2016 census, Eagle Vale had a population of 5,788 people. The median age in the suburb was 33, compared to a national median of 38. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.0% of the population. The most common ancestries in Eagle Vale were Australian 22.6%, English 19.6%, Irish 6.2%, Scottish 4.4% and Filipino 3.5%. 66.7% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Philippines 3.1%, New Zealand 2.6%, Fiji 2.0% and England 1.8%. 68.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Arabic 4.5%, Spanish 2.2%, Samoan 2.2%, Lao 2.2% and Tagalog 1.8%. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 32.2%, No Religion 16.5%, Anglican 15.7% and Islam 6.6%.

Despite what its name suggests, the Antarctic fur seal is mostly distributed in Subantarctic islands and its scientific name is thought to have come from the German vessel SMS Gazelle, which was the first to collect specimens of this species from Kerguelen Islands. Description This fur seal is a midsized pinniped with a relatively long neck and pointed muzzle compared with others in the family. The nose does not extend much past the mouth, the external ears are long, prominent, and naked at the tip. Adults have very long vibrissae, particularly males, up to 35 to 50 cm. The fore flippers are about one-third, and hind flippers slightly more than one-fourth, of the total length. These seals find the antarctic warm so they take plunges in cold water to stay cold. Adult males are dark brown in colour. Females and juveniles tend to be paler, almost grey with lighter undersides. Colour patterns are highly variable, and scientists reported that some hybridization between Subantarctic and Antarctic fur seals has occurred. Pups are dark brown at birth, almost black in color. About one in 1000 Antarctic fur seals are pale 'blonde' variants - not albino - and they stay so as adults. Males are substantially larger than females. Males grow up to 2 m (6.5 ft) long and with a mean weigh of 133 kg (293 lb). Females reach 1.4 m (4.6 ft) with a mean weight of 34 kg (74.9 lb). At birth, mean standard length is 67.4cm (58‚Äì66) and mass is 5.9kg (4.9‚Äì6.6) in males and 5.4kg (4.8‚Äì5.9) in females. Antarctic fur seals live up to 20 years with a maximum observed for female of 24. Geographic Range and Distribution Antarctic fur seals are believed to be the most abundant species of fur seal. The largest congregation occurs on South Georgia, which holds approximately 95% of the global population. The current best estimate for South Georgia is 4.5-6.2 million animals and 46,834 at Bouvet√∏ya. However, there are regional differences in population trends: some colonies are increasing in size (e.g. Kerguelen Islands, McDonald Islands), some are stables (e.g. Macquarie Island, Heard islands), some showing decrease (e.g. Bouvet√∏ya). Antarctic fur seals have a circumpolar distribution and breed from 61¬∞ S to the Antarctic Convergence. Breeding colonies are found at South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands, South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands and Bouvet√∏ya in the Southern Atlantic Ocean; Marion Island, Crozet Islands, Kerguelen and Heard Island in the Southern Indian Ocean; and Macquarie Island in the Southern Pacific Ocean. During winter, Antarctic fur seals range widely from the Antarctic continent to the Falkland Islands, and southern Argentina and Chile, reaching as far as the Mar del Plata and Gough Island. Behavior Antarctic fur seals are one of the better-studied Southern Ocean predators. However, the vast majority of information has been collected during summer breeding months. The breeding system of the Antarctic Fur Seal is polygynous, and dominant breeding males mate with as many as 20 females during a successful season. Males establish breeding grounds in October to early November. Females generally reach the colonies in December and give birth to a single pup several days later. Gestation lasts between 8 and 9 months and it has been observed a high breeding synchrony across the species‚Äô range, concentrating 90% of pup births in a 10-day window. Pups are weaned at about four months old. Juveniles may then spend several years at sea before returning to begin their breeding cycles. The ecology of Antarctic fur seals during the non-breeding winter is poorly understood. Adult and subadult males may form groups while moulting along the Antarctic Peninsula in late summer and early autumn. Adult females are gregarious but relatively asocial other than the strong bond they establish with their pups, although there are occasional aggressive encounters with nearby females or other pups and brief interactions with adult males to mate. These seals appear to be solitary when foraging and migrating. The usual food source for individuals in the Atlantic Region is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba); while in the Indian Ocean the diet is mostly based on fish and squid. The fish prey are principally myctophids, icefish, and Notothenids, although skates and rays are also consumed. Penguins are occasionally taken by Antarctic fur seal males. Seasonal differences in diet have been recorded across colonies, seasons and years. Studies have showed that female Antarctic fur seals can undertake wide-ranging foraging migrations during winter. Interannual differences appear to be related to differences in local oceanographic conditions. Taxonomy Antarctic fur seals are member of the genus Arctocephalus. Recently, a proposal was made to reassign this species to the resurrected genus Arctophoca. Antarctic fur seals can be confused with southern otariids that share their range, like Subantarctic (A. tropicalis), New Zealand (A. forsteri), and South American fur seals (A. australis), and the Juan Fernandez fur seal (A. phillippii), as well as the South American (Otaria flavescens) and New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri), are the most likely species to consider. Genetic studies on population structure have suggests that there are two genetically distinct regions: a western region including the islands of the Scotia Arc, Bouvet√∏ya, and Marion Islands, and an eastern region, including Kerguelen and Macquarie Islands. Seals from Crozet Islands and Heard Island are mixtures from both regions. Population status South Georgia islands, which hold approximately 95% of the global population, had a total population in 1999/2000 between 4.5 and 6.2 million. The South Georgia population reached carrying capacity fairly recently and may thus be spilling over into relatively nearby, lower density sites. However, the abundance of adult females is estimated to have declined by some 30% between 2003 and 2012, and by 24% since 1984 to around 550,000. The population trend according to the IUCN Red list is ‚Äòdecreasing‚Äô and it has been suggested that this decline is due to the effects of global climate change on prey availability. Threats Historically the species were decimated by the sealing industry for its fur and its population was driven close to extinction by the 19th century. Since sealing operations ceased in the early 20th century, the species has recovered at different rates across its former geographic range. Waters inhabited by Antarctic Fur Seals are exploited by few fisheries, but these may expand in their range in the future. A 1997 study at South Georgia indicated that several thousand Antarctic fur seals were entangled in man-made debris such as discarded fishing line, nets, packing bands and anything that can form a collar. Consequently, CCAMLR campaigned for compliance with MARPOL provisions relating to waste disposal at sea, and for cutting of any material jettisoned which could form collars to entangle seals. Subsequent monitoring of entangled fur seals confirmed that entanglement is still a persistent problem, but it has halved in recent years. Trawling activities developing around Macquarie Island may affect the prey base of the primarily fish-eating Antarctic fur seals that breed on those islands. Recent work indicates that there is significant overlap between foraging areas and fisheries activities, suggesting a potential for competition for prey resources may exist. Leopard Seals have been noted to take as many as a third of the Antarctic Fur Seal pups born at sites in the South Shetland Islands. Levels of predation may be high enough to cause a population decline at these sites. New Zealand Sea Lions have been reported to kill up to half of the Antarctic Fur Seal pup production in a season at Macquarie Island. As well as the effects of hunting and fishing, the numbers of humans visiting the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic each year for tourism and scientific expeditions has risen. This increase in visits has led to greater interaction between the local fauna and humans. With this greater interaction comes the risk of impacting the territoriality of seals especially during the mating season. This can also increase the possibility of ‚Äòexotic‚Äô injuries to humans. In 2015 a man was rescued from a South Georgia Island by British Forces after receiving a serious bite from a fur seal.‚ÄòBritish man bitten by fur seal on South Georgia rescued‚Äô, BBC News, Retrieved 28 November 2015, Due to the remote location of where these injuries occur this can lead to complications in getting people to a physician with the relevant experience in treating exotic animal bites. This issue is compounded by the complexity of fur seal behavior and how serious a bite can be and the risk of transfer of diseases. The implication for Antarctic Fur Seals but this species is considered to be one of several pinnipeds at high risk of future disease outbreaks because of their tendency to congregate in large dense aggregations and the effect of environmental changes associated with global warming on the spread of diseases. Finally, the 19th century population bottleneck led to reduced genetic diversity, leaving it again more vulnerable to disease and stresses of climate change. In particular, the Antarctic fur seal's primary prey base, krill, could be reduced as a result of ocean acidification, or the distribution could be altered by climate change. Conservation status IUCN Conservation status: Least Concern. The species is protected by the governments in whose waters it resides (Australia, South Africa, France) and by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals in waters south of 60¬∞ S. The animal is also listed in Appendix 2 of CITES.

Early life Coleman was born in Norfolk, Virginia, grew up in Decatur, Illinois and graduated in 1965 from MacArthur High School. He studied anthropology and zoology at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, and psychiatric social work at the Simmons College School of Social Work in Boston. He did further studies in doctoral-level anthropology at Brandeis University and sociology at the University of New Hampshire. Coleman taught at New England universities from 1980 to 2004, having also been a senior researcher at the Edmund S. Muskie School of Public Policy from 1983 to 1996, before retiring from teaching to write, lecture, and consult. Cryptozoology Coleman writes on popular culture, animal mysteries, folklore, and cryptozoology. An editor of the Skeptical Inquirer said, \\"among monster hunters, Loren's one of the more reputable, but I'm not convinced that what cryptozoologists seek is actually out there.\\" He has appeared on television and radio interviews about cryptids. He has written articles and books on cryptozoology and other Fortean topics. He was a publicity consultant on The Mothman Prophecies. Coleman has carried out fieldwork throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico, regarding sightings, trace evidence, and Native peoples' traditions of Sasquatch/Windigo/Bigfoot. He has written on Yeti and Bigfoot expedition sponsor Tom Slick and appeared on NPR discussing the death of Grover Krantz. Paraview Press introduced a series of books, \\"Loren Coleman Presents\\" in 2004. Coleman wrote introductions to volumes in the series. Coleman contributed to the exhibition \\"Cryptozoology: Out of Time Place Scale,\\" shown at Bates College Museum of Art (June 24 - October 8, 2006) and at the H & R Block Artspace at the Kansas City Art Institute (October 28 - December 20, 2006). Coleman is also a contributor/coauthor of the 2006 Bates exhibition catalogue and book, Cryptozoology: Out of Time Place Scale (JRP/Ringier Books, Switzerland, 2006). He also wrote the essay \\"Cryptids\\" for Alexis Rockman. (Monacelli Press, 2005). Academic writers Darryl Caterine and John W. Morehead criticized Coleman's assumption that a 1955 incident in which an Indiana woman was pulled underwater by something she did not see was caused by a half human, half fish creature called a \\"merbeing\\" as an example of \\"how cryptozoologists think about science fiction and its relationship to the natural world\\". Science writer Sharon A. Hill disagrees with Coleman's assertions that cryptozoology is \\"scientific and skeptically minded\\". Hill criticized Coleman's Crytomundo website, saying that members \\"show blatant disdain for scientists and investigators critical of their claims\\". In reviewing a book by Grover Krantz, Skeptical Inquirer editor Robert Boston said of Coleman and Jerome Clark's book Creatures of the Outer Edge, \\"Clark and Coleman are every bit as gullible as Krantz, but at least they know how to spin a monster yarn so that the reader gets an occasional chill\\". =International Cryptozoology Museum= Coleman established a Cryptozoology Museum in 2003 in Portland, Maine. The first downtown location for the museum opened in November 2009, occupying the rear of The Green Hand Bookshop, a Portland general used bookshop specializing in science fiction, fantasy, and other forms of Gothic fiction. On October 30, 2011, two years after moving onto Congress Street, it re-opened in a much larger space around the corner at 11 Avon Street, although it was still located in the Trelawny Building. The museum then moved again in the summer of 2016, opening in July on Thompson's Point, where it resides now. The Copycat Effect Coleman has a master's degree in psychiatric social work and was a consultant for the Maine Youth Suicide Program for nearly a decade. He authored several manuals and trained over 40,000 professionals and paraprofessionals statewide. A specific concern continues to be cases of murder-suicide among the young as well as the possibility of clusters (e.g., teen suicides, school shootings, workplace violence, and domestic terrorism) and the influence of media coverage, leading to his writing the books Suicide Clusters (Boston: Faber & Faber, 1987) and The Copycat Effect (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2004). He has been called on for statements in the aftermath of school shootings and how best to respond to the problem, mostly by the Canadian media.

Postmodern theatre emerged as a reaction against modernist theatre. Most postmodern productions are centered on highlighting the fallibility of definite truth, instead encouraging the audience to reach their own individual understanding. Essentially, thus, postmodern theatre raises questions rather than attempting to supply answers. Postmodern techniques A postmodern theatrical production might make use of some or all of the following techniques: # The accepted norms of seeing and representing the world are challenged and disregarded, while experimental theatrical perceptions and representations are created. # A pastiche of different textualities and media forms are used, including the simultaneous use of multiple art or media forms, and there is the 'theft' of a heterogeneous group of artistic forms. # The narrative needs not be complete but can be broken, paradoxical and imagistic. There is a movement away from linearity to multiplicity (to inter-related webs of stories), where acts and scenes give way to a series of peripatetic dramatic moments. # Characters are fragmented, forming a collection of contrasting and parallel shards stemming from a central idea, theme or traditional character. # Each new performance of a theatrical pieces is a new Gestalt, a unique spectacle, with no intent on methodically repeating a play. # The audience is integral to the shared meaning-making of the performance process and its members are included in the dialogue of the play. # There is a rejection of the notions of \\"High\\" and \\"Low\\" art. The production exists only in the viewer's mind as what the viewer interprets - nothing more and nothing less. # The rehearsal process in a theatrical production is driven more by shared meaning-making and improvisation, rather than the scripted text. # The play steps back from reality to create its own self-conscious atmosphere. This is sometimes referred to as metatheatre. While these techniques are often found in postmodern productions they are never part of a centralised movement or style. Rather, they are tools for authentic introspection, questioning and representation of human experience.

Other recent studies have indicated the genus may be paraphyletic.

Engraving by Virgil Solis for Ovid's Metamorphoses, Book I, 141‚Äì150. Cultural pessimism arises with the conviction that the culture of a nation, a civilization, or humanity itself is in a process of irreversible decline. It is a variety of pessimism formulated by a cultural critic. Traditional versions It has been significant presence in the general outlook of many historical cultures: things are \\"going to the dogs\\", the Golden age is in the past, and the current generation is fit only for dumbing down and cultural careerism. Some significant formulations have gone beyond this, proposing a universally-applicable cyclic model of history‚Äînotably in the writings of Giambattista Vico. Nineteenth century The pessimistic element was available in Arthur Schopenhauer's philosophy and Matthew Arnold's cultural criticism. The tide of Whiggish optimism (exemplified by Macaulay) receded somewhat in the middle of the reign of Queen Victoria. Classical culture, based on traditional classical scholarship in Latin and Greek literature, had itself been under attack externally for two generations or more by 1900, and had produced, in Friedrich Nietzsche, a model pessimistic thinker. Early twentieth century Oswald Spengler, author of The Decline of the West Cultural pessimism of the Oswald Spengler epoch might be seen as a refusal of the rather intellectual and secular choice between nihilism and modernism. Politically this tended to squeeze liberal thought. Specific criticism of the West, in the first years of the twentieth century, is usually taken as of the Old World of Europe, excluding therefore North America in particular. The classic source for this is Spengler's The Decline of the West (1918‚Äì1923), often cited in the years following its publication. The tone of much of the critical writing, for example, of T. S. Eliot, and the historical writing of Arnold J. Toynbee from the 1920s onwards, is identifiable. It was fashionable to say that Spengler had at least formulated some truths about the cultural situation of Europe after World War I. Eliot's major early work The Waste Land (1922) was commonly and directly interpreted in those terms. Contemporary proponents Towards the end of the 20th century, cultural pessimism surfaced in a prominent way. The very title of Jacques Barzun's From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present (2000) challenges the reader to be hopeful. On Matthew Arnold, a major cultural critic of the Victorian era, Barzun writes > According to Arnold, the behaviour of the English social classes was touched > neither by spiritual nor by intellectual forces; the upper orders were > barbarians, the middle classes philistines. (op. cit. p.573) The end of the millennium saw in the United States concerns rather specific to the conservative view on the culture wars and university education. Western Europe, on the other hand, struggled towards self-definition in the face of limiting demography, and postmodernism as at least journalistically predominant‚Äîthe difference primarily lying in the political prominence of the issues.

It was the third such bill introduced by a Liberal government during a 28-year period in response to agitation for Irish Home Rule. The Act was the first law ever approved by the Parliament of the United Kingdom that provided for a devolved government in any part of the UK proper (as opposed to colonial territories). However, the implementation of both it and the equally controversial Welsh Church Act 1914 was formally postponed for a minimum of twelve months with the beginning of the First World War. The continuation of the war beyond 1915 and subsequent developments in Ireland resulted in further postponements, meaning that the Act never became effective; it was finally superseded by a fourth home rule bill, enacted as the Government of Ireland Act 1920, which partitioned Ireland, creating Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, both intended to have Home Rule. History During 1909, a constitutional crisis began when the House of Lords rejected David Lloyd George's Finance Bill. Two general elections occurred in January and December 1910, both of which left the Liberals and Conservatives equally matched, with John Redmond's Irish Parliamentary Party having the balance of power in the House of Commons. The Irish Party, which had campaigned for home rule for Ireland since the 1870s, pledged to assist the Liberals in return for the introduction of a home rule bill.James F. Lydon, The Making of Ireland: From Ancient Times to the Present, Routledge, 1998, p. 326 The Parliament Act 1911 then replaced the unlimited veto of the Lords with one lasting only 2 years, ensuring that a bill passed by the Commons could not be blocked for more than two years. The Bill The Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, introduced the Bill on 11 April 1912.Hansard online, start of the debate 11 April 1912; accessed 20 January 2009 Allowing more autonomy than its two predecessors, the bill provided that: * A bicameral Irish Parliament would be established in Dublin (a 40-member Senate and a 164-member House of Commons) with powers to deal with most national affairs; * A number of Irish MPs would continue to attend the Parliament of the United Kingdom (42 MPs, rather than 103). * Dublin Castle administration would be eliminated, though with the retention of the Lord Lieutenant. The financial situation was a concern. Irish taxes had yielded a surplus of ¬£2 million in 1893, that had become a current spending net deficit of ¬£1.5m by 1910 that had to be raised by London. An annual \\"Transferred Sum\\" mechanism was proposed to maintain spending in Ireland as it was.Future financial arrangements, Hansard 11 April 1912 ‚Äì accessed 20 January 2009 The Bill was passed by the Commons by a majority of 10 votes in 1912 but the House of Lords rejected it by 326 votes to 69 in January 1913. In 1913 it was reintroduced and again passed by the Commons but was again rejected by the Lords by 302 votes to 64. In 1914 after the third reading, the Bill was passed by the Commons on 25 May 1914 by a majority of 77. Having been defeated a third time in the Lords, the Government used the provisions of the (new) Parliament Act to override the Lords and send it for Royal Assent. Ulster crisis Unionists in Ulster were opposed to a home-rule Ireland governed from Dublin. Hostility to the Home Rule Bill was increasing in the counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down, and Londonderry. Early in 1912, some of the residents of that area began forming small local militias. By April 1912, the Irish Unionist Alliance's managing politician, Sir Edward Carson, could review 100,000 marching Ulster Volunteers. On 28 September 1912, more than 500,000 Unionists signed the Ulster Covenant pledging to defy Home Rule by all means possible. The Covenant was developed by Carson and organised by Sir James Craig.Stewart, A.T.Q., The Ulster Crisis, Resistance to Home Rule, 1912‚Äì14, pp.58‚Äì68, Faber and Faber (1967) This Covenant specifically pledged not to acknowledge any Parliament out of Dublin, nor to obey its laws, nor pay any taxes levied by its government. This would be problematic especially since Ulster was the wealthiest and most prosperous part of Ireland. In January 1913, the Unionist Council reorganised their volunteers into a paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), whose members threatened to resist by physical force the implementation of the Act and the authority of any restored Dublin Parliament by force of arms.Stewart (1967), pp.69‚Äì78 On 28 November 1913, Irish Nationalists responded by forming the Irish Volunteers \\"to secure the rights and liberties common to all the people of Ireland\\"Annie Ryan, Witnesses: Inside the Easter Rising, Liberties Press, 2005, p. 12 The government's ability to oppose the Unionist threat was rendered questionable by the \\"Curragh Incident\\" of 20 March 1914, when many British Army officers at Curragh in County Kildare, the main Army camp in Ireland, threatened to resign or accept dismissal rather than deploy against the Ulster Volunteers, forcing the government to cancel planned troop movements. Partition At the Bill's third reading in the Commons on 21 May 1914 several members asked about a proposal to exclude the whole of Ulster for six years. Asquith was seeking any solution that would avoid a civil war. During the emotional debate which lasted until 25 May 1914, Sir Edward Carson made the statement: > \\"I say this to my Nationalist fellow-countrymen, and indeed also to the > Government, you have never tried to win over Ulster. You have never tried to > understand her position. You have never alleged, and you cannot allege, that > this Bill gives her one atom of advantage.\\"Gwynn, Denis: The Life of John > Redmond p.255, Harper & Co,, London (1932) A government amending bill was introduced in the House of Lords on 23 June 1914 (before the Lords had considered the original Home Rule bill itself) and passed there with amendments on 8 July. Carson and the Irish Unionist Party (mostly Ulster MPs) backed the amending bill, which provided for \\"temporary exclusion of Ulster\\" from the workings of the future Act. The Lords' amendments to the amending bill were unacceptable to the government. What was still to be negotiated were the number of counties excluded (four, six or nine) and whether exclusion would be temporary or permanent. The compromise proposed by Asquith was straightforward. Six counties in northeast Ulster were to be excluded \\"temporarily\\" from the territory of the new Irish parliament and government, and to continue to be governed as before from Westminster and Whitehall. How temporary the exclusion would be, and whether northeastern Ireland would eventually be governed by the Irish parliament and government, remained an issue of some controversy. To save prolonged debate in parliament, George V called the Buckingham Palace Conference with two MPs from each of the British Liberal and Conservative parties, and two each from the nationalists and unionists. The conference, held between 21 and 24 July 1914, achieved very little.Jackson, Alvin: pp.161‚Äì63 Passing of the Bill With the beginning of World War I on 4 August 1914, Asquith decided to abandon his Amending Bill, and instead rushed through a new bill, the Suspensory Act 1914, which was presented for Royal Assent simultaneously with both the Government of Ireland Act 1914 and the Welsh Church Act 1914. Although the two controversial Bills had now finally become statute on 18 September 1914, the Suspensory Act ensured that Home Rule would be postponed for the duration of the conflictJackson, Alvin: p.164 and would not come into operation until the end of the war.Hennessey, Thomas: Dividing Ireland, World War I and Partition, The passing of the Home Rule Bill p.76, Routledge Press (1998) (Eventually Home Rule was considered by the Irish Convention in 1917‚Äì18, and by the cabinet from September 1919; the Welsh Church Act was delayed until March 1920). The Ulster question was 'solved' in the same way: through the promise of amending legislation which was left undefined. Dublin was a battlefield for a week during the Easter Rising of 1916. This rebellion would have a major effect on the Home Rule passage and many Home Rulers would be troubled by this event. After the Rising, two attempts were made during the First World War to implement the Act. The first attempt came in June 1916, when Prime Minister H. H. Asquith sent David Lloyd George, then Minister for Munitions, to Dublin to offer immediate implementation to the leaders of the Irish Party, Redmond and Dillon. The scheme concerned partition, officially a temporary arrangement, as understood by Redmond. Lloyd George however gave the Ulster politician, Carson, a written guarantee that Ulster would not be forced into a self- governing Ireland. His tactic was to ensure that neither side would find out before a compromise was implemented.Maume, Patrick: The long Gestation, Irish Nationalist Life 1891‚Äì1918, pp.182‚Äì84, Gill & Macmillan (1999) A modified Act of 1914 had been developed by the Cabinet on 17 June. The Act had two amendments enforced by Unionists on 19 July ‚Äì permanent exclusion and a reduction of Ireland's representation in the Commons. When informed by Lloyd George on 22 July 1916, Redmond accused the government of treachery. This was decisive in determining the future fortunes of the Home Rule movement. Lloyd George, now Prime Minister, made a second attempt to implement Home Rule in 1917, with the calling of the Irish Convention directed by Horace Plunkett. This consisted of Nationalist and Unionist representatives who, by April 1918, only succeeded in agreeing on a report with an 'understanding' on recommendations for the establishment of self-government. The end of the war, in November 1918, was followed in Ireland by the December 1918 general election, the majority of seats being won by the republican separatist Sinn F√©in party, then in January 1919 by the Irish War of Independence, so that the Act was never implemented. The future of Home Rule was determined by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It established Northern Ireland, with a functional government, and Southern Ireland, the governmental institutions of which never functioned completely. Southern Ireland, following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, became the Irish Free State.

Unlike the first attempt, which was defeated in the House of Commons, the second Bill was passed by the Commons only to be vetoed by the House of Lords. Background Gladstone had become personally committed to the granting of Irish home rule in 1885, a fact revealed (possibly accidentally) in what became known as the Hawarden Kite. Though his 1886 Home Rule Bill had caused him to lose power, once re-appointed prime minister in August 1892 Gladstone committed himself to introducing a new Home Rule Bill for Ireland. As with the first bill, the second bill was controversially drafted in secret by Gladstone, who excluded both Irish MPs, the leadership of the (recently split) Irish Parliamentary Party and his own ministry from participating in the drafting. The decision led to a serious factual error in the Bill, a mistake over the calculation of how much Ireland should contribute to the British Imperial Exchequer. The error in the calculation was ¬£360,000, a vast sum for the time. The error was discovered during the Committee Stage of the Bill's passage through the Commons and forced a major revision of the financial proposals. Debate The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir William Harcourt, was himself alienated from the Bill having been excluded by Gladstone from its preparation, while the Chief Secretary for Ireland was engaged on other matters, and Gladstone, in the words of a historian, \\"increasingly disengaged\\". On 21 April, the Bill's second reading was approved by a majority of 347 to 304. By the third reading on 1 September, 26 of the Bill's 37 clauses had still not been debated. A fist-fight developed on the opposition benches between Home Rule and Conservative MPs. The Bill, though passed by the Commons with a slimmer majority of 30, had lost much of its credibility. At that time all legislation could be negated by the Conservative Party-dominated House of Lords, and here it failed on a vote of 41 in favour and 419 against.Jackson 2003, p.97. Contents The bill proposed: =Legislature= A bicameral Irish parliament to control domestic affairs, made up of a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly. * The Legislative Council would have 48 councillors, elected for eight-year terms in two cohorts at four-year intervals. The franchise would be based on a ¬£20 property qualification, higher than the ¬£10 qualification of the Assembly. The constituencies would be the three largest parliamentary boroughs (Dublin, Belfast, and Cork) and the 32 counties, except that County Cork was divided into East and West Ridings, and Counties Sligo and Leitrim were combined. Most constituencies would elect one member; the more populous, two or three.Government of Ireland Bill 1893, ¬ß7 and Schedule 1 * The Legislative Assembly would have 103 members, elected for a maximum of five years, with potential for earlier dissolution. The constituencies would be those previously used for Westminster, though the bill would reduce and redraw the Westminster constituencies. The initial franchise would be as for Westminster elections, but the parliament would have the right to alter this.Government of Ireland Bill 1893, ¬ß¬ß8, 10 and Schedule 2 * Disagreement between the houses would be resolved after two years by majority vote of the members of the two houses voting together.Government of Ireland Bill 1893, ¬ß9 =Executive= * An executive under the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland would form the Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Ireland. * The new executive would not be responsible to the Irish parliament and the bill did not provide for a prime minister. This did not in practice mean that the executive would not be answerable to the assembly, nor did it mean that there would be no prime minister. Contemporary British enactments for the dominions contained exactly the same provisions. However, in reality governments became answerable almost immediately, and, as in the case of Canada's Constitution Act, 1867, a prime ministerial office evolved early on, even if not mentioned anywhere in law. =Irish MPs in Westminster= This bill was different from the first bill that Gladstone introduced in 1886 because it allowed for the eighty Irish MPs to vote in Westminster; this was a reduction from the previous 103. Passed by the Commons, defeated in the Lords The Bill's second reading was passed by the House of Commons on 21 April 1893 by 347 votes to 304;HC Deb 21 April 1893 vol 11 c.1007 the final (third) reading was passed on 1 September 1893 by 301 to 267.HC Deb 1 September 1893 Vol.16 c.1839 However, in the House of Lords the second reading was defeated on 8 September 1893 by 419 votes to 41.HL Deb 8 September 1893 vol.17 c.649 This was a major stumbling block for the Irish MPs because the House of Lords was controlled by the Conservative Party and there would be little chance of it getting passed by them. Gladstone retired soon afterwards. Some historians now suggest that Gladstone was the author of his own defeats on home rule, with his secretive drafting alienating supporters, and enabling serious flaws to appear in the text of his bills.Jackson 2003, p.98.

Biography Tschudi was born in Glarus, and studied natural sciences and medicine at the universities of Neuch√¢tel, Leiden and Paris. In 1838 he travelled to Peru, where he remained for five years exploring and collecting plants in the Andes. He went to Vienna in 1843. In 1845 he described 18 new species of South American reptiles.\\"Tschudi\\". The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. Between 1857 and 1859 he visited Brazil and other countries in South America. In 1860 he was appointed Swiss ambassador to Brazil, remaining so until 1868, and again spent time exploring the country and collecting plants for the museums of Neuch√¢tel, Glarus, and Freiburg. In 1868 he became minister to Vienna. Peru He wrote a textbook on Peru called Peruvian antiquities in which he recorded various aspects of Peruvian life and history.Peruvian antiquities, by Johann Jakob von Tschudi and Mariano Eduardo de Rivero y Ust√°riz, translation by Francis L Hawkes, A.S. Barnes & Co., Cincinnati, 1855 In his book he explained the various skull angles of Peruvians in the context of the Angle of Camper. Tschudi claimed that Camper's facial angles were an \\"important angle in anthropology\\", whose \\"greater or less opening indicates the intellectual superiority of a race, and, up to a certain point, of individuals\\".Peruvian antiquities, page 29 He went on to explain that he had obtained for his personal collection the mummified foetus of a woman at seven months found in the cave of \\"Huichay\\" (\\"two leagues from Tarma\\"), and included two engravings of it, to prove that the shape of the cranium of the Huancas was not due to pressures placed upon the cranium after birth for cultural reasons.

It is used to support the computer infrastructure - in contrast to application software, which is aimed at directly performing tasks that benefit ordinary users. However, utilities often form part of the application . For example, a batch job may run user-written code to update a database and may then include a step that runs a utility to back up the database, or a job may run a utility to compress a disk before copying files. Although a basic set of utility programs is usually distributed with an operating system (OS), and this first party utility software is often considered part of the operating system, users often install replacements or additional utilities. Those utilities may provide additional facilities to carry out tasks that are beyond the capabilities of the operating system. Many utilities that might affect the entire computer system require the user to have elevated privileges, while others that operate only on the user's data do not. System utilities *Anti-virus utilities scan for computer viruses and block or remove them. *Clipboard managers expand the clipboard functionality of an operating system. *Computer access control software grants or denies requests for access to system resources. *Debuggers typically permit the examination and modification of data and program instructions in memory and on disk. *Diagnostic programs determine and report the operational status of computer hardware and software. Memory testers are one example. *Network utilities analyze the computer's network connectivity, configure network settings, check data transfer or log events. *Package managers are used to configure, install or keep up to date other software on a computer. *Registry cleaners clean and optimize the Windows Registry by removing old registry keys that are no longer in use. *System monitors monitor resources and performance in a computer system. *System profilers provide detailed information about installed software and hardware. Storage device management utilities *Backup software makes copies of all information stored on a disk and restores either the entire disk (aka Disk cloning) in an event of disk failure or selected files that are accidentally deleted or corrupted. Undeletion utilities are sometimes more convenient. *Disk checkers scan an operating hard drive and check for logical (filesystem) or physical errors. *Disk compression utilities transparently compress/uncompress the contents of a disk, increasing the capacity of the disk. *Disk defragmenters detect computer files whose contents are scattered across several locations on the hard disk and collect the fragments into one contiguous area. *Disk formatters prepare a data storage device such as a hard disk, solid-state drive, floppy disk or USB flash drive for initial use. These are often used to permanently erase an entire device. *Disk partition editors divide an individual drive into multiple logical drives, each with its own file system which can be mounted by the operating system and treated as an individual drive. *Disk space analyzers provide a visualization of disk space usage by getting the size for each folder (including sub folders) and files in folder or drive. showing the distribution of the used space. * Tape initializers write a label to a magnetic tape or other magnetic medium. Initializers for DECtape formatted the tape into blocks. File management utilities *Archivers output a stream or a single file when provided with a directory or a set of files. Archive suites may include compression and encryption capabilities. Some archive utilities have a separate un-archive utility for the reverse operation.

He was a U.S. Representative from 1891 to 1895 and Mayor of Cleveland for four terms from 1901 to 1909. Johnson was one of the most well known, vocal, and dedicated admirers of Henry George's views on political economy and anti-monopoly reform. Early life and business career Johnson's father, a wealthy cotton planter with lands in Kentucky and Arkansas, served in the Confederate Army in the Civil War. The war ruined the family financially, and they were forced to move to several locations in the South in search of work. By age 11, Johnson was selling newspapers on the railroads in Staunton, Virginia, and providing a substantial part of the family's support. He worked all through his youth, and never had more than one complete year of formal education.Johnson 1911, pp.1-7. Johnson's break came through an old family connection with the industrial du Pont dynasty. In 1869, the brothers A.V. and Bidermann du Pont gave him a clerk's job on the street railway business they had acquired in Louisville. Johnson rose rapidly in the business, and discovered a taste for the mechanical side of it. He patented several inventions, including an improved type of streetcar rail, and the glass-sided farebox still used on many buses today.Sheridan, Michael J. [www.johnsonfarebox.com The Story of the Johnson Farebox Company] Retrieved 2014-08-25. By 1876, thanks partly to royalties from his farebox, Johnson was able to strike out on his own, purchasing a controlling share in the street railways of Indianapolis. In the 1880s and 90s he expanded his interests to lines in Cleveland, St. Louis, Brooklyn and Detroit, and also entered the steel business, building mills in Lorain, Ohio, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania, to provide rails for streetcar tracks. He moved to Cleveland in 1883 and soon afterwards bought a mansion on the \\"Millionaire's Row\\" of Euclid Avenue. Politics and philosophy Two chance events helped spark Johnson's interest in politics and social questions, and convert him from a conventional business tycoon to a radical reformer. The first was reading, on the suggestion of a train conductor, Henry George's Social Problems, in which the political philosopher expounded his belief that poverty and misery were a result of society's newly created wealth becoming locked up in increasing land values, and advocating a Single Tax on land in place of wastefully taxing the productive activity of capital and labor.Johnson 1911, ch. VI. Johnson then became consumed by the arguments George made in Progress and Poverty; he read and reread it, finally requesting assistance from his business associates to find flaws in George's reasoning. Johnson took the book to his lawyer and said, \\"I must get out of the business, or prove that this book is wrong. Here, Russell, is a retainer of five hundred dollars [$13,000 in 2015]. I want you to read this book and give me your honest opinion on it, as you would on a legal question. Treat this retainer as you would a fee.\\" Johnson then sought out George in New York at the first possible opportunity, and the two became close friends and political collaborators. Johnson abandoned his business of rail monopoly and spent much of his fortune promoting the ideas of Henry George.George, Henry Jr., Tom L. Johnson, The Man and His Work, Twentieth Century Magazine, July 1911, reprinted on the website of the School of Cooperative Individualism.Howe, Frederic C. The Confessions of a Reformer. Kent, OH: Kent State UP, 1988. The second event was being present to witness the terrible Johnstown Flood of 1889. Johnson and his business partner Arthur Moxham organized the immediate relief activities in the stricken, leaderless city. Interpreting the events through a Georgist lens, the experience left him with a deep resentment of what he called 'Privilege'. The disaster had been caused by the improper maintenance of a dam holding a private recreational lake, owned by Henry Clay Frick and other Pittsburgh industrialists, who escaped all responsibility for it. More than that, to Johnson, the flood exemplified the inadequacy of charity and weak 'remedial measures' to solve society's problems.Johnson 1911, ch. V: 'The Lessons Johnstown Taught' Johnson mounted an unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1888, and then won the seat in 1890, serving two terms. He promoted free trade and the Single Tax idea, and was a useful moderate on the divisive currency question. The issue of privilege gradually made Johnson reconsider his own business career. 'Traction' (streetcar) companies depended on route franchises granted by city councils; political connections and payoffs gave favored companies the upper hand. In an era when most everyone rode the cars, the stakes were high, and battles for franchises were often the hidden issue behind cities' factional strife. Johnson knew the game intimately; in his speeches declaiming against the evils of the streetcar barons, he always pointed out that he could speak with authority, because he was one of them himself. In Cleveland, he came into conflict early with Mark Hanna, the powerful local businessman who by 1894 would be the leading power broker of the Republican Party, the man credited with putting fellow Ohioan William McKinley in the White House. Johnson's streetcar fights with Hanna and his allies make a colorful part of Cleveland political folklore. In a time when companies with a monopoly of transport on a route were able to charge five cents for a ride, he made the 'three-cent fare' a cornerstone of his populist philosophy, and later he would come out in favor of complete public ownership.Howe 1925, pp. 89-90. Through the 1890s Johnson gradually divested himself of most of his transit and steel holdings, to devote himself entirely to the politics of reform. In 1901, pressed on by influential citizens and a public petition, he decided to run for mayor of Cleveland. His campaign electrified the city. Johnson liked to rent large circus tents and set them up on neighborhood lots, attracting big crowds for whom he would deliver a powerful speech, banter cheerfully with hecklers, and finish with a stereopticon show with a political moral. On April 1, 1901, he was elected with 54% of the vote. Mayor of Cleveland Johnson's entry into office would prove just as dramatic as his campaign. One of the campaign issues had been a valuable piece of city-owned downtown lakefront property, which outgoing mayor John H. Farley and the council had agreed to hand over to the railroads without compensation. Johnson obtained a court injunction to stop the giveaway, but it was set to expire three days after the election. Taking advantage of a legal technicality to get the new mayor sworn in early, Johnson's men staged a surprise takeover of City Hall and saved the land for the cityCleveland Plain Dealer, 04-05-1901; Johnson 1911, pp.117-8. (today this land, with later landfill additions, holds Cleveland Browns Stadium, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Great Lakes Science Center). Johnson's four terms in office transformed Cleveland. Securing a bipartisan reform majority in the city council allowed him to effect major changes in every department of city government. Some of his policies were true innovations, while others mirrored those of the two other notable Progressive Midwestern mayors of the era, Hazen S. Pingree of Detroit and Samuel 'Golden Rule' Jones of Toledo. In the judgement of one urban historian, 'Johnson was a superb municipal technician. He grasped not only the ethics but the mathematics of government'.Klein, Maury and Kantor, Harvey A.: Prisoners of Progress: American Industrial Cities 1850‚Äì1920, p. 388. The new administration paved hundreds of miles of streets and expanded the city's park system, building a large number of playgrounds, ball fields and other facilities. To popular acclaim, the mayor tore up all the 'Keep off the Grass' signs in the city parks, a symbol of his belief in changing parklands' role from passive to active recreation.Miller, Carol Poh. 'Parks', article in the Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Retrieved 08-22-2014 Rubbish collection, then in private hands, had been a big campaign issue. Johnson eliminated the haulers' franchises and replace them with a municipal department; he hired back all the men who had lost their jobs, and demonstrated how a public service could provide better performance at lower cost.Johnson 1911, p. xxxiv. In keeping with the administration's focus on public health, a street cleaning force was started, and the city's Water Department was depoliticized and vastly improved. Public bathhouses were built in the poorest neighborhoods; some of these impressive buildings survive today. Johnson also began work on the monumental West Side Market, one of Cleveland's best-known landmarks. To improve housing conditions, the administration established the country's first comprehensive modern building code in 1904; the code became a model for many U.S. cities.Johanneson, 1979, p. 84. As Director of Charities and Correction, Johnson appointed his own pastor, Harris R. Cooley. Under Cooley, the city purchased a huge tract of farmland in Warrensville Township, where a new City Workhouse was established on humanitarian principles, along with cottages for the indigent elderly and a sanatorium. 'Harris Reid Cooley', article in the Encyclopedia of Cleveland History: Retrieved 08-22-2014 Johnson was fortunate in finding talented men to staff his administration. Police Chief Frederick Kohler, a stubborn, incorruptible martinet, gained national renown for cleaning up and professionalizing the force, and clamping down on vice. While laws were strictly enforced, Kohler made sure his men went easy on young first offenders and honest citizens in trouble.Obituary of Fred Kohler Cleveland Plain Dealer, 01-31-1934; Retrieved 08-22-2014 City Solicitor Newton D. Baker led the successful fight for 'Home Rule', working to give Cleveland a charter that would allow it greater independence from state oversight; Baker's efforts would pay off in 1912, when he wrote the amendment to the state constitution that brought full Home Rule to all Ohio's cities.Rose, 1950, p. 605. Both Baker and Kohler would become mayors in their own right, continuing Johnson's policies, and Baker later served as Secretary of War under Woodrow Wilson. The physical symbol of Johnson's revolution in government is Cleveland's civic center, a spacious park surrounded by public buildings, called simply 'The Mall'. The origins of the 'Group Plan' went back to a competition held by the Cleveland Architectural Club in 1895, but it was Johnson who pushed the appropriations through, and brought in a team headed by Daniel Burnham, the nation's leading planner, to design it. In an idealistic age, civic centers like this were consciously meant to be an architectural expression of democratic ideals. Burnham, who had created the Court of Honor at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and designed the restoration of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., brought the City Beautiful movement of the era to Cleveland; work on the Mall and its ensemble of public buildings continued well into the 1930s.Johanneson, 1979, pp. 70-77. Throughout the decade, the transit wars continued unabated.Lorenz, 1911, ch. 9-10. By 1903, the Hanna interests, the lines formerly run by Johnson, and others were consolidated into the Cleveland Electric Railway Company, a private near-monopoly opposed only by the Johnson-supported Municipal Traction Company, offering a three- cent fare. Seven years of conflict exhausted both firms and forced them into receivership. In 1910 voters approved a compromise plan called the 'Tayler Grant' under which Cleveland Electric Railway would lease the lines from the city and be assured of a 6% return.Spangler, James R. and Toman, James A., Cleveland and its Streetcars, Arcadia, 2005, pp. 7-8. Though the new arrangement worked well for decades, it was seen as a defeat for Johnson. Johnson took up the cause of municipal ownership not only in streetcars, but electric power, to bring down rates by offering competition to the monopoly private utility. He founded the Municipal Light and Power Company, and though political opposition kept him from expanding it, the next Progressive mayor, Newton D. Baker, built a new plant that opened in 1914 as the biggest public utility in the U.S. 'Muny Light' (now Cleveland Public Power) brought important savings on the city's own electric bills, and those of residents fortunate enough to have access to the service, while it forced the private competitor to keep its own rates low.Campbell, Thomas F. Municipal Ownership, article in the Encyclopedia of Cleveland History Retrieved 08-22-2014 In a booming city that for decades had been predominantly Republican, fiscally frugal and business-oriented, Johnson's policies made him an extremely divisive figure. As his associate Frederic C. Howe put it, it was a 'Ten Years' War', and people were either strongly for the mayor or strongly against him.Howe, 1925, p. 113. In winning his four terms, Johnson depended heavily on the vote from ethnic neighborhoods on the West Side, where his three-cent fare streetcars operated. In the middle and upper-class sections of the East Side, opponents railed against policies they called expensive and 'socialistic', pointing out that after only five years Johnson had nearly doubled the city's debt.Rose, 1950, p. 658. The tenacious opposition of the Republicans and the business interests kept most of Johnson's big plans tied up in legal battles. By 1909, Clevelanders were becoming increasingly weary of reform and endless political fights, and Johnson was defeated for re-election by a relatively obscure Republican, Herman C. Baehr. Having ruined his health and dissipated his considerable fortune in the cause of reform, Johnson lived just long enough to dictate his autobiography, My Story. He died in 1911, and was buried next to Henry George in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery. Legacy Statue of Tom Johnson holding Henry George's Progress and Poverty The revolution in government Johnson effected in Cleveland made him a national figure. The noted muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens called him \\"the best Mayor of the best- governed city in the United States.\\"Steffens, Lincoln, \\"Ohio: A Tale of Two Cities\\", McClure's Magazine, July 1905 Johnson's vision of a more honest, efficient and humane city government inspired Cleveland politics for decades to come. The years that followed his death were perhaps the most creative period in the city's history, in which it perfected excellent library and school systems, while completing the Group Plan's public buildings on the Mall and the ensemble of educational and cultural institutions at University Circle. The city was frequently cited as a model in many fields of government efficiency and social reform. Though Cleveland's elites would never come around to sharing Johnson's political ideas, his example did much to build a sense of civic duty and cooperative spirit among them. Typical of these was Frederick C. Goff, president of the city's largest bank, who once said \\"I am more concerned that the Cleveland Trust Company shall fulfill its obligations to the community than make money for the stockholders\\".Gunther, John, Inside U.S. A. Harper and Brothers 1947, p. 444 Goff was instrumental in founding the Cleveland Foundation, America's first community foundation. Melvin G. Holli, in The American Mayor: The Best and Worst Big-City Leaders (Penn State Press, 1999), polled American historians and social scientists to find the best city mayors throughout U.S. history. They placed Johnson second on the list, behind only Fiorello La Guardia of New York City. Family Johnson's brother Albert was also prominent in the streetcar business. In 1889, he became the financial backer and organizer of the Players' League, a baseball major league begun by the players themselves, in order to get a fair share of profits. A cousin, Henry V. Johnson, was Mayor of Denver, and Henry's son, the like-named Tom Loftin Johnson, was a noted artist.

He was considered a royalist and dedicated to the monarchy of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Wilcox's revolts were part of the Hawaiian Rebellions. Wilcox rebellion Robert William Wilcox The plot was to overthrow King David KalƒÅkaua, king of Hawaii, and replace him with his sister in a coup d'√©tat. =Background= In 1887, in response to increased political tension between the legislature and the king, a group of government ministers led by Interior Minister Lorrin A. Thurston with the support of the Honolulu Rifles, forced King David KalƒÅkaua to promulgate the Bayonet Constitution. The constitution stripped Asians of their voting rights while at the same time limited suffrage to wealthy Native Hawaiians, Americans and other Europeans. The king's own powers were limited substantially. Hostilities grew over the new constitution that limited mostly non-white commoners' rights and power. KalƒÅkaua's sister, Princess Liliuokalani and wife, Queen Kapiolani returned from Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee immediately after news reached them in Great Britain. =Plot and outcome=  ªIolani Barracks, 2007 In April 1887, Princess Lili ªuokalani attended the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria as part of KalƒÅkaua's delegation. Soon after the Jubilee celebrations, the delegation learned of the Bayonet Constitution that KalƒÅkaua had been forced to sign under the threat of death. A planned tour of Europe was cancelled and the group returned to Hawaii. Lili ªuokalani felt that her brother, KalƒÅkaua, was not competent to be King. In October 1887 and about the same time as Lili ªuokalani, KalƒÅkaua's distant cousin, a native Hawaiian officer and veteran of the Italian military, Robert William Wilcox returned to Hawaii. Wilcox had returned when the funding for his study program stopped after the new constitution was signed. Wilcox, Charles B. Wilson, Princess Liliuokalani, and Sam Nowlein plotted to overthrow King KalƒÅkaua to replace him with his sister, Liliuokalani. They had 300 Hawaiian conspirators hidden in Iolani Barracks and an alliance with the Royal Guard, but the plot was accidentally discovered in January 1888, less than 48 hours before the revolt would have been initiated. No one was prosecuted but Wilcox was exiled. So on February 11, 1888, Wilcox left Hawaii for San Francisco, intending to return to Italy with his wife. =A second plot= Princess Liliuokalani was offered the throne several times by the Missionary Party who had forced the Bayonet Constitution on her brother, but she believed she would become a powerless figurehead like her brother and rejected the offers outright. Wilcox Rebellion of 1889 In 1887, in response to increased political tension between the legislature and the king, a group of government ministers led by Interior Minister Lorrin A. Thurston with the support of an armed militia, forced King David KalƒÅkaua to promulgate the 1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The constitution stripped Asians of their voting rights while at the same time limited suffrage to wealthy native Hawaiians, Americans and other Europeans. The king's own powers were limited substantially. A native Hawaiian officer and veteran of the Italian military, Robert William Wilcox, organized a rebellion on July 30, 1889, to revive the powers of the monarch over administration. The rebellion was thwarted by the absence of the King at  ªIolani Palace (who was needed to promulgate a new constitution), and the Honolulu Rifles. Wilcox was tried for treason, and acquitted despite his obvious guilt. Burlesque Conspiracy The Burlesque Conspiracy is also known as an event called the Sandbag Incident. The name of the conspiracy, Burlesque, was mainly to mock Marshal of the Kingdom Charles Wilson for appearing to have been tricked into putting the Kingdom on a high state of alert for no reason. =Background= After the rise to power by Queen Liliuokalani, members of the National Liberal Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom became frustrated with her over a feeling of neglect to removing the Bayonet Constitution. Wilcox organized another plot in 1892 by forming a group called the Hawaiian Patriotic League which included John Edward Bush, Volney V. Ashford, and J. W. \\"Bellowing\\" Bipikane. The intentions of this group were to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. =Sandbag Incident= Wilcox and Bush's speeches drew the attention of Charles Wilson. He had agents infiltrate the group and inform him of the League's activities. In March 1892 Wilson was informed of an imminent Coup d'√©tat. In response he put the Kingdom under high alert and sandbagged  ªIolani Palace (hence the name of the incident), effectively diverting the attempt. In response by the League to the Kingdom's lockdown, they aborted the coup and no event occurred. To the public the heightened alertness appeared to have no basis, since no confrontation happened, making Wilson look like a paranoid fool (hence the name of the conspiracy). =Aftermath= Wilson raided the League on May 20 arresting and jailing more than a dozen conspirators including Wilcox for plotting to overthrow the government. Wilcox spent 36 days in jail and was not convicted, leading to his release. Ministers to the queen felt that the exposing of the conspiracy made it harmless. The conspiracy was received by Liliuokalani as one of many voices demanding the removal of the 1887 Constitution, subsequently she drafted the 1893 Constitution. 1895 Counter-Revolution in Hawaii In 1895, Wilcox participated in another attempt, this time to overthrow the Republic of Hawai ªi and to restore Liliuokalani to power. Royalist supporters landed a cargo of arms and ammunition from San Francisco, California in a secret Honolulu location. At the location on January 6, 1895, a company of royalists met to draft plans to capture the government buildings by surprise. A premature encounter with a squad of police alarmed Honolulu and the plans were abandoned as the royalists were quickly routed. Wilcox spent several days in hiding in the mountains before being captured. The son of one pro-annexationist was killed. Several other skirmishes occurred during the following week resulting in the capture of the leading conspirators and their followers. The government allegedly found arms and ammunition and some potentially evidential documents on the premises of Washington Place, Lili ªuokalani's private residence implicating her in the plot. Wilcox's continued resistance Hawaiian Independent Party, under the leadership of Wilcox, the first Congressional representative from the Territory of Hawaii A few years later, after Wilcox's final rebellion, he organized the Hawaiian Independent Party, later renamed the Home Rule Party, and won the majority of the seats in the Legislature. Wilcox was elected and served in Congress from November 6, 1900, to March 3, 1903, an advocate for Hawaiian rights and sovereignty, and against annexation. But tensions between Governor Sanford B. Dole (with veto power) and the Home Rule Party did not allow legislation to be passed. Wilcox died the same year he left office. Wilcox continues to be regarded as a hero by the Hawaiian Sovereignty Movement.

The group was formed as theater-based, to perform at its own theater at Akihabara on a daily basis, so that fans could always go and see them live.

Staley shed some light on the subject in a Rolling Stone article in 1992: \\"The name came from a side project of my old group [Alice N' Chains]. We were going to have this band that dressed up in drag and played heavy metal as a joke.\\" Alice N' Chains' bassist Johnny Bacolas explained the name in the 2011 book Everybody Loves Our Town: A History of Grunge. Bacolas and Russ Klatt (the lead singer of Slaughter Haus 5), were at a party in North Seattle talking about backstage passes. One of the passes said \\"Welcome to Wonderland\\", and they started talking about that being an Alice in Wonderland- type thing, until Klatt started saying, \\"What about Alice in Chains? Put her in bondage and stuff like that.\\" Bacolas thought the name \\"Alice in Chains\\" was cool and brought it up to his Sleze bandmates and everyone liked it, so they changed the name of the band. Since three of the members had very Christian mothers, they thought spelling it \\"Alice N' Chains\\" made it not sound a bondage name. After Staley left Alice N' Chains, he contacted his former bandmates and asked for permission to use the name with his new band with guitarist Jerry Cantrell. * Alien Ant Farm ‚Äî Bassist Terry Corso said the name was a day dream he had about how Earth is just an experiment for aliens from other planets. * The All-American Rejects ‚Äî The \\"All-Americans\\" and \\"the Rejects\\", both suggested to the band as names, were merged.Yonke, David.

Several suggestions were made and, according to DeYoung, the name Styx was chosen because it was \\"the only one that none of us hated\\". * Sum 41 ‚Äî The band started 41 days into the summer. The band was originally a NOFX cover band named Kaspir; they changed their name to Sum 41 for a Supernova show on September 28, 1996. * Sunn O))) ‚Äî After the Sunn amplifier brand. The O and the three right parentheses come from the sphere and waves depicted in the Sunn logo. * Super Furry Animals - Derived from a clothing range set up by singer Gruff Rhys's sister. * Switchfoot ‚Äî A surfing term meaning being able to ride with either foot forward. * System of a Down ‚Äî Derived from a poem written by the guitarist Daron Malakian, named 'Victims of a Down', which was changed to System of a Down to place them closer alphabetically to their idols Slayer. T * Taking Back Sunday ‚Äî A song by Long Island band The Waiting Process who were inspired by their grandmother, Tina, that they should take back Sunday from the Christian people in Long Island. * Talking Heads ‚Äî Bassist Tina Weymouth explained that \\"A friend had found the name in the TV Guide, which explained the term used by TV studios to describe a head-and-shoulder shot of a person talking as 'all content, no action.'

New York: Sire Records Company * Tangerine Dream ‚Äî Edgar Froese, in an interview in Let It Rock magazine, claimed they named themselves 'after the Beatles line in the song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds'. Clearly, with English not being his first language, he misheard 'Tangerine Trees' as 'Tangerine Dreams'. * Tears for Fears ‚Äî from a line in the book Prisoners of Pain by American psychologist Arthur Janov. Much of the band's early material is influenced by Janov's writings. * Teddybears ‚Äî Invented as a way to stand out at a time when almost every Swedish and Norwegian hard rock band was named something like \\"Corpse Grinder from Hell\\". * Thee Michelle Gun Elephant ‚Äî A friend of the band mispronounced the name of The Damned's album Machine Gun Etiquette. * Therapy? ‚Äî The band chose the name because it was a simple word that everyone knows. The reason for the question mark at the end of the name was because when lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was writing out the spines for the cassettes to send off to the record companies, he began writing too far to the left, so to centre the writing and make it look more professional, he added a question mark to the end and it stuck with the band. * They Might Be Giants ‚Äî The name of a 1971 film, in which George C. Scott plays a man who believes he is Sherlock Holmes. The film's title is in turn a reference to the literary character Don Quixote, who mistook windmills for giants. The name had previously been used by a ventriloquist friend of the band. * Thirty Seconds To Mars ‚Äî The name of the band came after a thesis of an ex-professor of Harvard. One of the sub-sections was titled as \\"Thirty Seconds To Mars\\" and talks about the technological advance that connects with humans and it said that we were literally 30 seconds from Mars. The band on their origins said that that phrase describes their music in a nutshell.:es:30 Seconds to Mars#Etimolog.C3.ADa * Three Days Grace ‚Äî According to frontman Adam Gontier, the name refers to a sense of urgency, with the question of being whether someone could change something in their life which would take at least three days. * Three Dog Night ‚Äî According to The Three Dog Night Story, 1964‚Äì1975, vocalist Danny Hutton's then-girlfriend June Fairchild suggested the name after reading a magazine article about indigenous Australians, in which it was explained that on cold nights they would customarily sleep in a hole in the ground whilst embracing a dingo, a native species of wild dog. On colder nights they would sleep with two dogs and if the night were freezing, it was a \\"three dog night\\". * Thompson Twins ‚Äî From Thomson and Thompson, the bumbling detectives in Herg√©'s comic strip series The Adventures of Tintin. *TLC ‚Äî Acronym for their nicknames T-Boz, Left Eye, and Chilli. * Toad the Wet Sprocket ‚Äî In Eric Idle's monologue \\"Rock Notes\\" (heard on Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album), a journalist reports that \\"Rex Stardust, lead electric triangle with Toad the Wet Sprocket, has had to have a elbow removed following their recent successful worldwide tour of Finland.\\" * Tokio Hotel ‚Äî After \\"Tokio\\", the German spelling of the Japanese city Tokyo, due to the band's love of the city, and \\"Hotel\\" due to their constant touring and living in hotels. * Toto ‚Äî In the early 1980s, band members told the press that the band was named after the dog in The Wizard of Oz.Campbell, Mary (July 11, 1982). \\"Toto's biggest hit\\".

The artist has a master's degree in law and thus is eligible to actually formally practice as a judge, but he chose a career in music instead. * Turo's Hevi Gee ‚Äî Originally named \\"Turo's Hevi Gentlemen\\" after Pedro Hietanen's band Pedro's Heavy Gentlemen, later changed to \\"Turo's Hevi Gee\\" on Hietanen's suggestion, to avoid confusion. * Twenty One Pilots ‚Äî Lead singer Tyler Joseph got the name from studying the play All My Sons by Arthur Miller in a theatre class. The play is set in World War II, and the main character finds that parts to various planes are faulty but lets them fly anyway, resulting in the deaths of 21 pilots. U * U2 ‚Äî Bono once said that the band name came from its interactivity with the audience, as in \\"you too\\". U2 is also the designation of a famous spy plane (as U-2), as well as the name of the subway line that connected East and West Berlin, on which Zoo Station (also the name of a song on the album Achtung Baby) is found. * UB40 ‚Äî The UK government's form number for the Unemployment Benefit Attendance Card, as shown on the band's debut album Signing Off. * UBBA ‚Äî An acronym of the Swedish phrase \\"Utan B, Bara A\\", meaning \\"without B, only A\\". The name is an intentional spoof of the famous Swedish band ABBA, but the resemblance to the Viking chief Ubba is just a coincidence. * Ugly Kid Joe ‚Äî A parody of the LA glam band, Pretty Boy Floyd. * Undercover Slut ‚Äî After Wendy Whitebread, Undercover Slut, an X-rated comic book from 1990. * Uriah Heep ‚Äî Creepy character from the novel David Copperfield by Charles Dickens.

Although initially called Mammoth, the band changed its name when it found out Mammoth was already taken by another band. * The Velvet Underground ‚Äî After a book about sadomasochism by Michael Leigh. * Veruca Salt ‚Äî After the character from the children's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. * The Villebillies ‚Äî From a lyric written by vocalist Derek \\"Child\\" Monyhan shortly after joining the group. It is a combination of the words Louisville, the band's hometown and largest urban center in Kentucky (often locally nicknamed \\"The Ville\\"), and hillbilly, referring to eastern Kentucky's rural mountain culture. The name references the cross genre nature of the band's music. * Violent Femmes ‚Äî According to bassist Brian Ritchie, he came up with the name of the group as a fake band name when one of his bandmates questioned his assertion that his brother was also in a band‚Äîhe and percussionist Victor DeLorenzo liked the name, so they used it for themselves. *VAST ‚Äî The acronym VAST stands for Visual Audio Sensory Theater and is the main creation of singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Jon CrosbyVAST W *Wang Chung ‚Äî The Chinese word ÈªÉÈêò huang chung means \\"yellow bell\\" and the first note in the Chinese classical music scale. *Wardruna ‚Äî Einar Selvik has stated that the name 'Wardruna' means 'warden of the runes'. * Weezer ‚Äî Lead vocalist Rivers Cuomo needed to come up with a name when the band received a big break to open for Keanu Reeves' band Dogstar in 1992. Cuomo quickly nominated Weezer, a nickname given to him when he was a kid by other children who were teasing him about his asthma. Afterwards, the band had a long meeting and kicked around many more names, but nobody could come up with anything better. * The Whitlams ‚Äî After the 21st Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam. * The Who ‚Äî Were originally called The Detours, then changed their name to The Who after a suggestion by guitarist Pete Townshend's friend Richard Barnes. Their first manager, Pete Meaden, renamed them The High Numbers, and they released one unsuccessful single, \\"Zoot Suit\\", under that name. When EMI dropped them, the band sacked Meaden and went back to being called The Who. Another possible reason was because of Townshend's grandmother, who would always refer to popular bands as \\"The Who?\\", due to her impaired hearing. * Widespread Panic ‚Äî Due to anxiety problems, lead guitarist Mike Houser used to have the nickname \\"Panic\\".

But infielder Elio Chac√≥n didn't understand the English term, so he and outfielder Richie Ashburn collided a few times while chasing fly balls. Another teammate suggested that Ashburn yell the words in Spanish instead‚Äî\\"yo la tengo\\"‚Äîso Chac√≥n would understand. After that Ashburn and Chac√≥n no longer ran into each other. But another teammate, Frank Thomas, didn't understand the Spanish term. So one day while chasing a fly ball, despite hearing Ashburn call out \\"yo la tengo,\\" Howard ran into Ashburn. * Young Fathers ‚Äî The band was named so because all three members have their fathers' names. * Youth Lagoon ‚Äî Inspired by a painting that Trevor Powers described in an early interview as depicting a group of children playing in a giant pool.

He was the first securely attested local Saite king of the 26th Dynasty of Egypt who reigned for 8 years (672‚Äì664 BCE) according to Manetho's Aegyptiaca. Egypt was reunified by his son Psamtik I. Biography In 672 BCE Necho became ruler of Sais, assuming the pharaonic titulary, and a year later the Assyrians led by Esarhaddon invaded Egypt. Necho became one of Esarhaddon's vassals, and the latter confirmed Necho's office and his possessions, as well as giving him new territories, possibly including the city of Memphis. In 669 BCE, king Taharqa of the 25th Dynasty was advancing from the south toward the Nile Delta principalities which were formally under Assyrian control; once he was aware of that, Esarhaddon prepared himself to return to Egypt to repel the invader, but he died suddenly. Esarhaddon's death led to a political crisis in the Neo-Assyrian Empire but at the end his son Ashurbanipal managed to become the new undisputed monarch. The counter- offensive planned by his father took place in 667/666 BCE. Taharqa was defeated and driven back to Thebes, but Ashurbanipal found that the fleeing king and some of the rulers of Lower Egypt ‚Äì named Pekrur of Pishaptu (Per- Sopdu), Sharruludari of ·π¢inu (maybe Pelusium) and Nikuu (Necho I) ‚Äì were plotting against him. The Assyrian king captured the conspirators, killed part of the population of the cities they governed, and deported the prisoners to Nineveh. Unexpectedly, Necho was pardoned by the Assyrian king, and was reinstated at Sais with his previous possessions as well as many new territories as a gift, while his son Psamtik (called Nabusezibanni in Akkadian) was made mayor of Athribis. It has been suggested that with his magnanimity Ashurbanipal hoped to rely on the loyalty of an Egyptian ally in the event of another offensive led by the 25th Dynasty pharaohs, and perhaps to inspire and strengthen a rivalry between the two families (i.e., Kushites and Saites) because of shared interests. According to historical records, Necho I was slain in 664 BCE near Memphis while defending his realms from a new Kushite offensive led by Taharqa's successor Tantamani while Psamtik fled to Nineveh under Ashurbanipal's aegis. This Nubian invasion into the Egyptian Delta was subsequently (664/663 BCE) repelled by the Assyrians who proceeded to advance south into Upper Egypt and performed the infamous sack of Thebes. With the Nile Delta secured once again, Psamtik I was appointed with his dead father's offices and territories. Later, he ultimately was successful in reuniting Egypt under his sole control. =Family= Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt made claims regarding Necho I: studying a papyrus from Tebtunis, he stated that Necho I was the son of a king named Tefnakht, presumably Tefnakht II. Ryholt also put in discussion the existence of Nekauba who was the purported predecessor of Necho I and possibly his brother; Ryholt suggested that the few, dubious documents regarding Nekauba should be attributed to the later Necho II instead, and that Necho I was the direct successor of Tefnakht II. French historian Christian Settipani believes that Necho married Istemabet, and they were the parents of Psamtik I. According to British Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen, it is possible that princess Ta-khered-en-ta- ihet-[weret] was Necho's daughter, given in a politically arranged marriage to the local ruler of Herakleopolis, Pediese. A now-lost limestone lintel from Luxor depicted a chantress of Amun named Meresamun along with a Saite form of Osiris and the Divine Adoratrice of Amun Shepenupet II; Meresamun is called \\"royal daughter of the lord of the Two lands, Nec[...]\\", the latter name written within a royal cartouche. It appears likely that Meresamun's royal father was no other than Necho I who sent his daughter to the Precinct of Amun-Re in Karnak, thus marking the beginning of the Saite influence in the city of Thebes. Attestations Kneeling statuette of a king Necho. It may depict either Necho I or II. Brooklyn Museum (acc.no. 71.11) Necho I is primarily known from Assyrian documents but a few Egyptian objects are known too. A glazed pottery statuette of Horus which contains his cartouches and a dedication to the goddess Neith of Sais is now exhibited at the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology (UC 14869). The aforementioned, long‚Äìlost lintel of Meresamun was once photographed in an antiquities market at Luxor. A bronze kneeling statuette of a king Necho is housed at the Brooklyn Museum (acc.no. 71.11), but it is impossible to determine if it actually depicts Necho I or rather Necho II instead. He is also mentioned in several demotic stories. Necho I's Year 2 is attested on a privately held donation stela that was first published by Olivier Perdu. The stela records a large land donation to the Osirian triad (Osiris, Isis, and Horus) of Per-Hebyt (modern Behbeit el-Hagar near Sebennytos) by the \\"priest of Isis Mistress of Hebyt, Great Chief... son of Iuput, Akanosh.\\" References Bibliography     External links * Category:664 BC deaths Category:7th-century BC Pharaohs Category:Pharaohs of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Monarchs killed in action ","title":"Necho I"},{"id":"904269","text":"A glass of red wine Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored grape varieties. The actual color of the wine can range from intense violet, typical of young wines, through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines. The juice from most purple grapes is greenish-white, the red color coming from anthocyan pigments (also called anthocyanins) present in the skin of the grape; exceptions are the relatively uncommon teinturier varieties, which produce a red-colored juice. Much of the red-wine production process therefore involves extraction of color and flavor components from the grape skin. It is a delicacy around the world.  Varieties  The top 20 red grape varieties by acreage are: * Alicante Henri Bouschet * Barbera * Bobal * Cabernet Franc * Cabernet Sauvignon * Carignan * Cinsaut * Malbec * Douce noir * Gamay * Grenache * Isabella * Merlot * Montepulciano * Mourv√®dre * Pinot noir * Sangiovese * Syrah * Tempranillo * Zinfandel The top 21‚Äî50 red grape varieties by acreage are: * Aglianico * Blaufr√§nkisch * Bord√¥ * Carm√©n√®re * Castelao * Concord * Corvina Veronese * Criolla Grande * Croatina * Dolcetto * Dornfelder * Marufo * Menc√≠a * Black Muscat * Nebbiolo * Negroamaro * Nero d'Avola * Pamid * Petit Verdot * Pinot Meunier * Pinotage * Prokupac * Ruby Cabernet * Saperavi * Tannat * Tinta Barroca * Touriga Franca * Touriga Nacional * Trincadeira * Zweigelt  Production  = Grape processing = The first step in red wine production, after picking, involves physical processing of the grapes. Hand-picked or machine-harvested grapes are usually tipped into a receival bin when they arrive at the winery and conveyed by a screw mechanism to the grape-processing equipment. = Destemming and crushing = On arrival at the winery there is usually a mixture of individual berries, whole bunches (particularly with hand-picked grapes), stems, and leaves. The presence of stems during fermentation can lead to a bitter taste in the wine, and the purpose of destemming is to separate grapes from the stems and leaves. Mechanical de-stemmers usually consist of a rotating cage perforated with grape-sized holes. Within this cage is a concentric axle with arms radiating towards the inner surface of the cage. Grapes pass through the holes in the cage, while stems and leaves are expelled through the open end of the cage. After destemming, the grapes are commonly lightly crushed. Crushers usually consist of a pair of rollers, and the gap between them can usually be regulated to allow for light, hard or no crushing, according to the winemaker's preference. The mixture of grapes, skins, juice and seeds is now referred to as must. The must is then pumped to a vessel, often a tank made of stainless steel or concrete, or an oak vat, for fermentation. In common with most modern winemaking equipment, destemmers and crushers are normally made of stainless steel (food-grade stainless steel for those parts which come into physical contact with the grapes). = Additions at reception = The preservative sulfur dioxide is commonly added when grapes arrive at the winery. The addition rate varies from zero, for perfectly healthy grapes, to up to 70 mg/litre, for grapes with a high percentage of rot. The purpose is to prevent oxidation and sometimes to delay the onset of fermentation. Macerating enzymes (for instance glucanases) may also be added at this stage, to aid extraction of color and fruit flavours from the skins and to facilitate pressing. Tannin may be added now, later in the winemaking process, or not at all. Tannin can be added to help stabilize colour, to prevent oxidation, and to help combat the effects of rot. = Cooling of the must = Some winemakers prefer to chill the must to around 10¬∞C (50¬∞F), to allow a period of pre- fermentation maceration (\\"cold soaking\\"), of between one and four days. The idea is that color and fruit flavours are extracted into the aqueous solution, without extraction of tannins which takes place in post-fermentation maceration when alcohol is present. This practice is by no means universal and is perhaps more common in New World winemaking countries. = Inoculation and fermentation = Once the must is in a fermentation vessel, yeast naturally present on the skins of the grapes, or in the environment, will sooner or later start the alcoholic fermentation, in which sugars present in the must are converted into alcohol with carbon dioxide and heat as by-products. Many winemakers, however, prefer to control the fermentation process more closely by adding specially selected yeasts usually of the species Saccharomyces ellipsoideous. Several hundred different strains of wine yeast are available commercially, and many winemakers believe that particular strains are more or less suitable for the vinification of different grape varieties and different styles of wine. It is also common to add yeast nutrient at this stage, often in the form of diammonium phosphate. = Pumping over = Soon after the must is placed in the fermentation vessel, a separation of solid and liquid phases occurs. Skins float to the surface, forming a cap. In order to encourage efficient extraction of colour and flavour components, it is important to maximize contact between the cap of skins and the liquid phase. This can be achieved by: * pumping over (pumping liquid from the bottom of the tank and spraying it over the floating cap; normally this would be done several times per day during fermentation) * punching down the cap (either manually or using an automated mechanical system) * submerging the cap (the cap is kept beneath the surface of the liquid phase by a physical restraint) * drain and return (the above techniques can all be supplemented by a drain and return operation, in which the liquid phase is drained off the skins into another vessel and then pumped back over the skins) There are also other techniques besides pumping over and punching down. For example, the GOFermentor, first introduced in 2014, uses an air bag to squeeze the cap and break up the grape skins. This has many benefits, including gentler cap management, the wine being more homogeneous, and the temperature being more uniform, reducing problems with reductive aromas. = Temperature control = Fermentation produces heat and if left uncontrolled the temperature of the fermenting may exceed 40¬∞C (104¬∞F), which can impair flavour and even kill the yeast. The temperature is therefore often controlled using different refrigeration systems. Winemakers have different opinions about the ideal temperature for fermentation, but in general cooler temperatures (25-28¬∞C; 77‚Äì82.4¬∞F) produce fruitier red wines for early drinking while higher temperatures (28-35¬∞C; 82.4-95¬∞F) produce more tannic wines designed for long aging. = Following the fermentation = Winemakers will usually check the density and temperature of the fermenting must once or twice per day. The density is proportional to the sugar content and will be expected to fall each day as the sugar is converted into alcohol by fermentation. = Pressing = Pressing in winemaking is the process where juice is extracted from grapes. This can be done with the aid of a wine press, by hand, or even by the weight of the grape berries and clusters themselves.Jeff Cox \\"From Vines to Wines: The Complete Guide to Growing Grapes and Making Your Own Wine\\" pgs 131-142 Storey Publishing 1999 Historically, intact grape clusters were trodden by feet but in most wineries today the grapes are sent through a crusher/destemmer which removes the individual grape berries from the stems and breaks the skins, releasing some juice, prior to being pressed. There are exceptions, such as the case of sparkling wine production in regions such as Champagne where grapes are traditionally whole- cluster pressed with stems included to produce a lighter must that is low in phenolics.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pgs 285-286, 545-546, 767 Oxford University Press 2006 In white wine production, pressing usually takes place immediately after crushing and before primary fermentation. In red wine production, the grapes are also crushed but pressing usually does not take place till after or near the end of fermentation with the time of skin contact between the juice and grapes leaching color, tannins and other phenolics from the skin. Approximately 60-70% of the available juice within the grape berry, the free-run juice, can be released by the crushing process and does not require the use of the press. The remaining 30-40% that comes from pressing can have higher pH levels, lower titratable acidity, potentially higher volatile acidity and higher phenolics than the free-run juice depending on the amount of pressure and tearing of the skins and will produce more astringent, bitter wine.R. Boulton, V. Singleton, L. Bisson, R. Kunkee Principles and Practices of Winemaking pgs 91-95, 219 Springer 1996 New York Winemakers often keep their free-run juice and pressed wine separate (and perhaps even further isolate the wine produced by different pressure levels/stages of pressing) during much of the winemaking process to either bottle separately or later blend portions of each to make a more complete, balanced wine.Jim Law The Backyard Vintner pgs 114-117, 140-143 Quarry Books 2005 Gloucester, MA D. Bird \\"Understanding Wine Technology\\" pg 47-53 DBQA Publishing 2005 In practice the volume of many wines are made from 85-90% of free-run juice and 10-15% pressed juice.Dr. Yair Margalit, Winery Technology & Operations A Handbook for Small Wineries pgs 41-46 The Wine Appreciation Guild (1996) = Types of press = There are many different types of wine press, but they can be broadly divided into continuous presses and tank presses. Modern winemaking tends to favour tank presses with pneumatic membranes, which squeeze the grapes more gently than continuous presses. The press wine is often kept separate from the free-run, and kept for later blending or disposing. press can also be dependent on climate and slothrating. = Malolactic fermentation = A second microbiological transformation commonly takes place after the alcoholic fermentation of red wines. This is usually referred to as the malolactic fermentation (MLF), in which malic acid, naturally present in grape juice, is converted into lactic acid under the influence of bacteria (it is not strictly a fermentation). MLF is almost universally practised for red wines. It often occurs naturally, owing to the presence of lactic acid bacteria in wineries, but there are also commercially available preparations of bacteria to inoculate for MLF if necessary. = Racking = Once the MLF is complete, the red wine is usually racked (decanted) off its lees (dead yeast cells and other solids), and has sulfur dioxide preservative added to avoid oxidation and bacterial spoilage. = Aging = Most red wine is aged for some period before bottling, though this can vary from a few days, in the case of Beaujolais Nouveau to 18 months or more in the case of top Bordeaux reds. Aging can take place in stainless-steel or concrete tanks, or in small or large oak barrels. The latter impart some flavour to the wine as a function of their age and size (small, new barrels give more flavour than large, older barrels). = Fining and stabilization = Red wines sometimes undergo fining, which is designed to clarify the wine and sometimes to correct faults such as excess tannin. Fining agents include egg white and gelatin. Some red wines, particularly those designed for early drinking, are cold stabilized so as to prevent the precipitation of unsightly tartrate crystals in the bottle. = Filtration and bottling = Most wines are filtered at some stage before bottling, although some winemakers use the absence of filtration as a marketing tool. Filtration serves to make wine completely clear and to eliminate any remaining yeast cells and bacteria, which could render the bottled wine microbiologically unstable. Wine is normally filled to glass bottles with cork stoppers, though aluminium screwcap closures and plastic stoppers are also common.

This is often done with the idea of implementing or promoting change by informing the general populace about a given problem and appealing to people's sense of justice. Social commentary can be practiced through all forms of communication, from printed form, to conversations to computerized communication. Two examples of strong and bitter social commentary are the writings of Jonathan Swift and Martin Luther. Swift exposed and decried the appalling poverty in Ireland at the time, which was viewed as the fault of the British government. Martin Luther decried corruption in the Catholic Church, including what today would be termed pedophilia.In 1531, Martin Luther claimed that Pope Leo X had vetoed a measure that cardinals should restrict the number of boys they kept for their pleasure, \\"otherwise it would have been spread throughout the world how openly and shamelessly the pope and the cardinals in Rome practice sodomy.\\" Examples of social commentators from the lower social strata are Charles Dickens and Will Rogers.  Forms  This list is far from exhaustive. Examples of social commentary may be found in any form of communication. Artistic works of all mediums are often defined by what they say about society. Despite being wordless, the memorable image of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 may be considered one of the most profound commentaries of the power of the individual. = Visual artwork = Inspiration for some artists can come from issues that are present today. Deborah Silverman, Professor of History and Art History at the University of California in Los Angeles, states that the \\"Analysis of particular visual forms expands to an interpretation of art and artists as carriers of cultural history in the crucible of modernity.\\" This notion has been present in art throughout time. An example is Vincent Van Gogh's 1885 painting 'The Potato Eaters'. This picture depicts a group of poverty stricken people gathered in a small room around a table. Vincent Van Gogh created this piece of artwork in order to present a confronting time to the viewer. A modern example is street art, also known as graffiti. With an international reputation, artist and political activist Banksy is known to produce street art that raises public issues such as slave Labour, loss of childhood and the effects of war. = Photography = Social commentary photography's purpose is to \\"expose social issues on ethics, society, religious, the way of life, how people live and other similarities.\\" Sometimes this includes the harsh reality of society such as homelessness, discrimination, war and defenceless children. \\"Social Commentary artists try their best to create artworks in order to convey messages to the community.\\" Due to the fact that the photos are of real life situations, the contents can be perceived to be more confronting than other visual forms of social commentary. An example are the works of photojournalist and war photographer James Nachtwey. James Nachtwey's works include the Rwanda Genocide (1994), the Somalia famine (1992) and the Jakarta Riots (1998) and the September 11 attacks in 2001, just to name a few. =Direct publication= =Public speaking= Most public speaking constitutes social commentary of some form. Many sermons will describe the ills of society and offer religious solutions. Many politicians may speak in a similar fashion - in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar one can see Mark Antony's funeral speech as a commentary. The larger audience offered by radio and television has diminished the significance of public speaking as a means of social commentary. The United Nations General Assembly is one of the biggest global organisations that focus of planet Earth and humans. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) strive to make the Earth a better place, however without the input of many passionate individuals the UNGA would not be able to achieve this. Influential public speakers such as Pope Francis, Malala Yousafzai, President Barack Obama and Queen Elizabeth II, comment of society's issues. This allows the UNGA to directly listen to the issues at hand and address them accordingly. =Fiction= Allegorical fictional works such as Animal Farm clearly contain a social commentary and one can find some degree of social commentary in almost any novel. To Kill a Mockingbird can be interpreted as a commentary on racial issues, especially given the date of its publication (1960). Another example of social commentary is Thomas More's Utopia in which he uses the Utopia to satirize the values of 16th century Britain. Social commentaries have been searched for even in fantasy novels such as The Lord of the Rings, though such connections often require much conjecture. =Non-fiction= Directly speaking to a topic in the social discourse in writing by defining the audience, the bounds of the topic, and the presenting facts and opinions based on the primarily author and possibly on another's perspective. =Radio, television and film= Fictional works in these mediums have a similar scope to that of their literary counterparts and documentaries to the non-fiction works described above. Television and films often use powerful images to enhance their message, for example, Michael Moore's films utilise this to great effect in promoting his political beliefs. Some examples of films include Food, Inc., The Story of Stuff featuring Annie Leonard, and Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me. And to a lesser degree, the prominent Italian exploitation film Cannibal Holocaust uses graphic violence, shocking imagery, and underlying topics in anthropology to express Ruggero Deodato's distaste for modern society - more importantly - what it has become. West Indian calypsonians participate annually in songwriting competitions with the common use of double entendre, humour and metaphor as well as monikers to avoid legal complications (see Calypso Music). Monologists An early radio monologist was the American Will Rogers, with sharp and good-humored observations upon society during the 1920s and 1930s. Current American monologists include: *Jay Leno *Garrison Keillor *Jon Stewart *Dick Gregory *George Carlin *Stephen Colbert *Craig Ferguson *David Letterman *Conan O'Brien *Bill Maher *Jimmy Fallon Discussion shows There are a number of discussion shows that do not have a call in segments, but which sometimes have discussions (beyond mere interviews) with personages of current interest. In the United States of America, some such shows include: *Jay Leno *David Letterman *Oprah Winfrey *Steve Harvey Talk shows (call-in) In the late 20th century through the present, radio and television phone-in shows allow limited discussion and sometimes debate on such issues, although if involving politics or issues exploited for political purposes the discussion is often directed by the \\"moderator\\" toward a specific point of view, typically by terminating non-conforming phone calls. In more balanced forums it is common that a panel of well-known social commentators or experts on aspects of a topic will respond to comments from listeners after an introductory interactive discussion directed by the moderator, with only the obstreperous or extreme caller summarily terminated. =Newspapers and comic books= What is probably the most common social commentary is that of the editorial section of newspapers, where columnists give their opinion on current affairs. The letters section of papers allows a similar platform for members of the public. Editorial cartoons, such as those in The New Yorker, perform a social commentary, often with a humorous slant. The conventional comic section is more limited, but sometimes with social commentary, often subtle and oblique, or more bold, abrasive, and consistently pointed as in, Li'l Abner, Pogo, Doonesbury, Bloom County, and Boondocks or in pulp comics such as Howard the Duck. Many other even more explicitly provocative comics (usually with a far left of center point of view) appear in various free weekly newspapers such as the San Francisco Bay Guardian and the East Bay Express (in the San Francisco Bay Area) and the Village Voice (in New York City), and similarly in many other locals, often those with a strong university or college presence. =The Internet= The web performs a similar function to the letters section described above. It is ripe with social commentary because it allows the dissemination of ideas by anyone with a computer to a potentially enormous audience, as well as instant comment and discussion. Its international scope is particularly attractive, with language the only major barrier to communication. Discussion and debate occurs in many forums and chat rooms.

History =Royal Air Force use= The station was originally a grass airfield within No. 4 Group RAF. In the early 1940s the airfield was entirely reconstructed with three hardened runways replacing the grass. It re-opened in October 1942 as a station for 77 Squadron RAF and along with RAF Melbourne and RAF Pocklington was known as \\"No. 42 Base\\". The squadron had a strength of approximately 20 aircraft and initially used the twin engined Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bomber although this was quickly replaced by the Handley Page Halifax four engined heavy bomber which was being introduced. No. 77 Squadron suffered heavy losses during its time at Elvington with over 500 aircrew killed, missing or taken prisoner and almost 80 Halifaxes lost as it played a major part in the Battle of the Ruhr and the bombing of Berlin. In May 1944 No. 77 Squadron posted to the newly opened nearby RAF Full Sutton and was replaced at Elvington by two French squadrons, numbers 346 \\"Guyenne\\" and 347 \\"Tunisie\\" who both played a leading part in the bombing of Germany. Elvington was the only airfield in the United Kingdom used by the remainder of the Free French Forces, they also flew Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers until they moved to Bordeaux in October 1945 where they became the basis for the new air force of liberated France. In September 1957 a memorial was unveiled in Elvington village dedicated to the two French squadrons. While they were at RAF Elvington nearly half of the squadrons' members were killed. After the war the airfield was transferred to No. 40 Group RAF under the control of RAF Maintenance Command until 1952 when it was greatly enlarged and extended for use by the United States Air Force. =United States Air Force use= The United States Air Force (USAF) built a new runway, which was the longest in the north of England, and a huge rectangular hardstanding apron as well as a new control tower to turn Elvington into a \\"Basic Operation Platform\\" which would have operated as a Strategic Air Command (SAC) dispersal airfield. After spending ¬£4 millionThe Manchester Guardian, 8 May 1958, Page 3. the airfield never became operational as a SAC base and was abandoned by the US Air Force in 1958. =Other uses= In the early 1960s the Blackburn Aircraft Company, now part of British Aerospace used the runway for test flights of the Blackburn Buccaneer. Elvington retained its status as an RAF relief landing ground and was used by the RAF flying training schools at RAF Church Fenton and RAF Linton-on-Ouse until the airfield was finally closed in March 1992.\\"Allied Air Forces Memorial, Elvington, York (Guide to an Operational WWII Bomber Command Station\\", Yorkshire Air Museum, Leaflet (No ISBN) Gives history of airfield. Motorsport A race circuit was established which appears to have been used by the British Racing and Sports Car Club (BRSCC). The inaugural car race meeting took place on 8 July 1962 and was reported by Autosport, which said that the BRSCC hoped to run a further meeting September, but this appears not to have taken place. A second meeting did take place a year after on 7 July 1963, but these two appear to have been the sum total of car racing at Elvington. However, in June 1970 Auto 66 Club held a Motorcycle Road Race meeting at Elvington, with a second meeting in September. The following season these were upgraded to National Status events. Although local critics thought the club had gone well over the top, but the National event attracted over 400 riders, including stars of the future like Mick Grant and Barry Sheene. The Auto 66 Club continued to organise meetings at this track.Peter Swinger, Motor Racing Circuits in England : Then & Now (Ian Allan Publishing, , 2008) Record breaking In October 1969, when preparing for a challenge at Monzas high-speed banked-oval circuit to a record held by Moto Guzzi, Ray Pickrell practiced by riding a Dunstall Norton road-going motorcycle during a regular sprint meeting.

He is believed to have been born on July 25, in either 1008 or 1010 as Jakob,Snorre Sturluson (1992), Nordiska kungasagor: Olav den heliges saga. Stockholm: Fabel\\", p. 107, 127 (Olav the Saint's Saga, Chapter 88 and 94) the son of King Olof Sk√∂tkonung and Queen Estrid. Being the second Christian king of the Swedish realm, his long and partly turbulent reign saw the increasing dissemination of Christianity. He is referred to in positive terms in German and Norse historical sources. Accession The main sources for Anund Jacob's reign are the near-contemporary ecclesiastic chronicle of Adam of Bremen and several Norse histories from the 12th and 13h centuries, in particular Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla. Adam and Snorri both relate that Anund Jacob's father Olof Sk√∂tkonung (c. 995-1022) ran into trouble with his subjects towards the end of his reign.Adam av Bremen (1984), Historien om Hamburgstiftet och dess biskopar. Stockholm: Proprius, p. 102-3 (Book II, Chapter 58). According to Adam, the still pagan population of Svealand urged the fervently Christian ruler to withdraw to V√§sterg√∂tland. Snorri, on the other hand, asserts that King Olof's high-handed rule caused the Swedes to rise against him, whereby his young son Jacob was hailed as king. When the Swedish Thing was to elect him the ruler of Sweden, the people objected to his non-Scandinavian name. They then gave him the name of Anund.Snorre Sturluson (1992), Nordiska kungasagor: Olav den heliges saga. Stockholm: Fabel, p. 127 (Olav the Saint's Saga, Chapter 94). Olof and Anund Jacob eventually came to an agreement: Olof was to retain his royal title for the rest of his life, but Anund Jacob would be co-ruler and govern part of the realm, and had to support the peasantry if Olof caused further trouble. In Snorri's chronology this happened in c. 1019. Three years later Olof died, leaving Anund Jacob as the sole ruler.Snorre Sturluson (1992), p. 158 (Olav the Saint's Saga, Chapter 114). Political agenda Indigenous Swedish historiography has preserved very meager recollections of the pre-1250 rulers, but points out Anund Jacob as a heavy-handed master. The enumeration of kings appended to the Westrogothic law (c. 1240) says that he had the epithet of Kolbr√§nna (\\"Coal- burner\\") as he had the habit of burning down the houses of his opponents. This may refer to the practice known from medieval Sweden of legally burning the houses of people who opposed the authorities.N. Beckman, \\"Anund Jakob\\", Svenskt biografiskt lexikon A different opinion of his character is given by Adam of Bremen: \\"Certainly he was young of years, but he surpassed all his predecessors in wisdom and piety. No king was as beloved by the Swedish people as Anund\\".Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 103 (Book II, Chapter 59). The Norse sagas emphasize his amicable and helpful attitude to his royal Norwegian kinsmen. Anund Jacob continued the minting of coins in Sigtuna in Central Sweden; however, the issuing of coins was broken off later during his reign, and was only resumed by King Canute I in the late 12th century.Peter Sawyer (1991), N√§r Sverige blev Sverige. Alings√•s: Viktoria Bokf√∂rlag, p. 33. Snorri mentions Central Sweden, V√§sterg√∂tland and Sm√•land among the regions ruled by Anund Jacob, but his ideas of Sweden might be influenced by conditions in the High Middle Ages.Ove Moberg (1941), Olav den helige, Knut den store och Sverige. Lund: Gleerups, p. 205. A poem from the 1040s, describing a Norwegian battle against Danes and Swedish auxiliaries, suggests that at least some Geats stood under Anund Jacob: \\"Geatic shield and hauberk / did I bring home from the battle\\".Snorre Sturluson (1993), Nordiska kungasagor: Magnus den gode till Magnus Erlingsson. Stockholm: Fabel, p. 57 (Magnus the Good's Saga, Chapter 33). According to Adam of Bremen, Christianity reached rather widely in the reign of Anund Jacob,Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 111 (Book II, Chapter 73). with missionary work led by Bishop Thurgot of Skara in V√§sterg√∂tland until 1030 when he was nominally succeeded by Gottskalk. Both were appointed by the Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen. Gottskalk, however, was a passive church magnate who preferred to stay home in Germany. An English missionary, Sigfrid, filled the void to an extent. From a Norwegian base, he visited Sweden, G√∂taland \\"and all the islands beyond the northern land\\".Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 102 (Book II, Chapter 57). King Anund Jacob's political agenda included maintaining the balance of power in Scandinavia, which is why he supported the Norwegian kings Olaf II (Olav the Saint) and Magnus I against Denmark's and England's king Cnut the Great during the 1020s and 1030s. According to Snorri, Cnut tried to neutralize Anund Jacob, when a dispute flared up with Olaf around 1025, by sending him rich presents and offers of friendship. However, the envoys noted Anund Jacob's strong affinity to Olaf, who was married to his sister Astrid. In fact Anund Jacob traveled with a large entourage to Kungah√§lla where he met Olaf for a friendly parley.Snorre Sturluson (1992), p. 190, 198 (Olav the Saint's Saga, Chapter 132, 134). Some time later, when Cnut was away tending his English kingdom, Olaf attacked and ravaged Sjaelland, while Anund Jacob came down with a fleet from Svealand to attack Scania. The allies combined their forces and awaited Cnut, who returned from England with a superior fleet in 1026. While the late Norse accounts are highly unreliable, some details of the war are mentioned in contemporary scaldic verses and confirm Anund Jacob's intervention.Snorre Sturluson (1992), p. 231-7 (Olav the Saint's Saga, Chapter 145-149). The Battle of Helge√• According to Snorri's account of the Battle of Helge√•, the Swedish and Norwegian fleets arrived to the estuary of Helge √• on the east coast of Scania. There they prepared a trap by building a levee of wooden branches and turf close to the estuary. When Cnut's fleet approached, the levee was torn down and the rushing water and floating logs created disorder in the Danish fleet. However, many Danish ships were soon ready to confront the Swedes and Norwegians. In the face of the superior enemy, Anund Jacob and Olaf withdrew. Olaf later sneaked back to Norway with his entourage via Sm√•land and V√§sterg√∂tland.Snorre Sturluson (1992), p. 237-40 (Olav the Saint's Saga, Chapter 149-150). The actual circumstances of the Battle of Helge√• are debated among historians due to conflicting sources. The near-contemporary Anglo-Saxon Chronicle asserts, under the year 1025 (error for 1026): \\"This year King Cnut went to Denmark with a fleet to the holm by the holy river [Helge √•]; where against him there came Ulf and Eilaf, with a very large force both by land and sea, from Sweden. There were very many men lost on the side of King Cnut, both of Danish and English; and the Swedes had possession of the field of battle.\\"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle The identity of Ulf and Eilaf (probably subordinate officers to Anund Jacob) is not known - possibly they are identical with two brothers by that name who were sons of the Swedish or Geatish magnate Ragnvald Ulfsson.Snorre Sturluson (1992), p. 120 (Olav the Saint's Saga, Chapter 93). They could also be the Anglo-Danish Ulf Jarl and his brother Eilaf, since some late accounts allege that Ulf fought on the Swedish-Norwegian side in the war.Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks kr√∏nike A contemporary scaldic verse by Sigvat Thordarson partly conforms with Snorri by stating that Cnut beat back or stopped the Swedish attack (Sv√≠um hnekk√∞ir √ûu) and defended his realm against two kings.Snorre Sturluson (1992), p. 240 (Olav the Saint's Saga, Chapter 150. However, this is a poem in praise of Cnut and thus not an impartial source. It is therefore not entirely clear if Anund Jacob and Olaf were victorious over or defeated by Cnut. It has even been suggested that the battle in fact was fought in southeastern Uppland, where a river appears to have been called Helg√• in the Middle Ages. According to that hypothesis, the site fits the topographical details of Snorri's account much better than eastern Scaniae.Bo Gr√§slund (1986), \\"Knut den store och Sveariket: Slaget vid Helge√• i ny belysning\\", Scandia\\" 52:2. Thus, the results of the war are not clear either in the sources. It is obvious however that the Swedish-Norwegian attack failed, since Cnut remained master of his realm and was able to make a pilgrimage to Rome in 1027. On his way back to Denmark he dictated a letter, saying that he intended to make peace and treaty with the peoples and nations which had tried to deprive him of his kingdom and life, but had failed since God deprived them of their power.Curt Weibull (1921), Sverige och dess nordiska grannmakter under tidigare medeltiden. Lund: Gleerup, p. 150. In the following year Olaf II was driven from his Norwegian kingdom and Cnut was hailed as overlord in his stead.Anglo-Saxon Chronicle . Cnut also claimed to be king over part of the Swedes in these years. Coins in the name of Cnut were minted in Svealand in about the same era. All this suggest that the lands around Lake M√§laren may have ousted Anund Jacob for a while, and hailed Cnut.N. Beckman, \\"Anund Jakob\\", Svenskt biografiskt lexikon The possibility of a brief Danish suzerainty in Central Sweden has engendered considerable debate; on one hand Cnut's coins might simply be copied from the Anglo-Danish coinage in a mechanical way, but on the other hand a number of numismatists have argued that the coins are too original in making to be considered copies.Bo Gr√§slund (1986), p. 213-6. At any rate King Anund Jacob was in power again around 1030. Supporting Magnus the Good When expelled by Cnut, Olaf II of Norway went via Sweden to Kievan Rus with his son Magnus. In 1030 he made an attempt to regain his throne. Anund Jacob provided him with a force of 400 skilled men, and allowed him to recruit as many men as possible from his realm.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 104 (Book II, Chapter 61). However, Olaf was killed fighting a Norwegian peasant army at the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030. Five years later his son Magnus came over to Sigtuna in Sweden from Rus and met with his stepmother Astrid Olofsdotter, Anund Jacob's sister. According to Snorri's account, supported by a number of contemporary scaldic verses, Astrid advocated Magnus's cause at a thing in Hangrar. A sizable force of Swedish warriors gathered under Magnus, who invaded Norway via H√§lsingland in 1035. The enterprise was a great success and the pretender was hailed as king (Magnus I, Magnus the Good).Snorre Sturluson (1993), Nordiska kungasagor: Magnus den gode till Magnus Erlingsson. Stockholm: Fabel, p. 19-25 (Magnus the Good's Saga, Chapter 1-5). Cnut the Great died in the same year and his sons lacked his capacity. When the last of them, Harthacnut, died in 1042, Magnus inherited Denmark as well. Anund Jacob's policy of maintaining a Nordic power balance can be seen in the agenda shift that followed. Anund Jacob kept Cnut's nephew Sweyn Estridsen as a proteg√© and supported his pretensions to the Danish throne. As related by both Snorri and Adam of Bremen, Sweyn made repeated attempts to establish his authority in Denmark but was repeatedly defeated by King Magnus. After every defeat, he found refuge with Anund Jacob in Sweden. Magnus died in 1047 and bequeathed Norway to his uncle Harald Hardrada, while Sweyn's right to the Danish throne was acknowledged. In spite of that, a new war flared up between Sweyn and Harald, where Anund Jacob seems to have continued supporting Sweyn.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 113, 137-8 (Book II, Chapter 78, Book III; Chapter 12-13); Snorre Sturluson (1993), p. 48-62 (Magnus the Good's saga, Chapter 29-37); Per Sveaas Andersen (1977), Samlingen av Norge og kristningen av landet 800-1130. Bergen: Universitetsforlaget, p. 165. The struggle was still on when Anund Jacob died. Eastern politics The Russian Nestor Chronicle relates that the \\"varyag prince\\" Yakun, dressed in a golden cloak, led an eastbound Swedish expedition to the other side of the Baltic Sea in 1024. He provided military reinforcements to Yaroslav I the Wise in a battle against Mstislav of Chernigov. The battle was fought during a thunderstorm and ended in a defeat for the allies, and Yakun went back across the sea.A. Norrback, Nestorskr√∂nikan. Stockholm: Norstedt & S√∂ner, 1919, p. 90. According to Gudmund J√∂ran Adlerbeth of the Swedish Academy (1802), Yakun was identical with King Anund Jacob.Uplysning uti konung Anund Jacobs Historia utur Ryska Handlingar in Kongl. Vitterhets Historie och Antiquitets Akademiens Handlingar, Stockholm 1802 p. 61 Alternatively, the name Yakun could correspond to someone named H√•kan, unknown in the history of the era.Ernst Kunik (1844), Die Berufung der schwedischen Rodsen durch die Finner und Slaven. St.-Petersburg: Kaiserlichen Academie der Wissenschaften A major Swedish Viking expedition to the east was carried out around 1040, and was led by the chief Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The expedition is mentioned on a large number of rune stones from Central Sweden. Judging from the inscriptions the enterprise ended up in Serkland (the Muslim lands to the southeast of Russia), apparently under disastrous circumstances. A late Icelandic saga contains all sorts of fantastic details about the expedition. According to the saga, Ingvar was a kinsman of King Anund Jacob, being a great-grandson of Eric the Victorious.Hans Gillingstam, \\"Ingvar vittfarne\\", Svenskt biografiskt lexikon ; Mats G.

Death and succession King Ane's Stone at the suggested burial site of King Anund Jacob Anund Jacob's reign has traditionally been dated from 1022 to approximately 1050, but there is uncertainty about the year he died. He was probably alive in 1049, since Adam places his death after the death of the Danish prince Bj√∏rn, an earl in England, in that year; his half-brother and successor Emund is certain to have ruled Sweden in the summer of 1060.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 138, 275. According to Adam of Bremen, Anund Jacob was married to a certain Gunhild who might previously have been the wife of Sven Estridsen.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 189 (Book III, Scholion 66). Adam does not suggest that they had any children, but a later chronicler Saxo Grammaticus (c. 1200) says that Sweyn Estridsen's spouse Gyda was a daughter of the Swedish king, by implication Anund Jacob.Saxo Grammaticus, Danmarks kr√∏nike It has been suggested by Birger Nerman and others that King Anund Jacob was buried where King Ane's Stone is located in West Gothland.Article by Marianne Gustafsson for Fr√§mmestad Village Two skalds are known to have served Anund Jacob: Sighvatr √û√≥r√∞arson and √ìttarr svarti. The Hervarar saga from the 13th century concludes with a chronicle of the Swedish kings which briefly epitomizes Anund Jacob's reign: {  √ñnundr h√©t sonr √ìl√°fs konungs s√¶nska, er konungd√≥m t√≥k eptir hann ok var√∞ s√≥ttdau√∞r. √Å hans d√∂gum fell √ìl√°fr konungr inn helgi √° Stiklast√∂√∞um.

In 1900, native Hawaiians and their supporters created the Hawaiian Independent Party (later renamed the Independent Home Rule Party). Formation Robert William Wilcox 1900On June 6, 1900, Robert Wilcox, upon his return from the U.S. continent advocating for native Hawaiian rights in the Organic Act, spoke to a rally sponsored by Hui Aloha  ªƒÄina and Hui KalaiƒÅina, the two main Hawaiian political clubs. In his speech, he said, \\"The question of the restoration of the Monarchy is gone from us forever. We are now a people, however, who can vote. You all know we have two-thirds of the votes in this country.\\" He also advised against racial loyalties, saying, \\"We are all Americans. We should not consider personality.\\" On June 7, 1900, the Hawaiian Independent Party was established, its motto being, \\"Equal Rights for the People\\". Despite its motto, and Wilcox's sentiments, it would remain a racially based party. Legislature In the first election in 1900 the ruling Republican Party (formerly the Reform Party) misjudged the voting demographics under the territorialship, though the new government excluded Asians, women, and other minorities, it allowed more people to become eligible voters, swinging the voting majority toward Native Hawaiians. The Home Rule Party succeeded on a nationalist platform in becoming the majority party in the Territorial Senate. In the Territorial House of Representatives, the Home Rule party gained a plurality, but importantly not a majority, of the seats.http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/110/JL11116.pdf?sequence=2 They sent Robert William Wilcox to represent the territory in the United States Congress. On November 11, 1900, the Independent Home Rule Party was formally established, and the two anti-annexation groups that formed it, Hui Aloha  ªƒÄina and Hui KƒÅlaiƒÅina, were officially dissolved. As a newly elected delegate from Hawaii, Wilcox proved to be fairly ineffective. On the floor of the United States House of Representatives, Wilcox was challenged by his poor command of the English language, and his lack of alignment with either of the main parties (Democrat and Republican). Although upon his election, he took a more moderate tone, the Home Rule Party proved to be obstructionist and was blamed for a distinct lack of progress in the Territorial legislature. One particular political miscalculation of note was Wilcox's support of the so- called leper bill, which cost him a great deal of support amongst his native Hawaiian base. Opening of the legislature on the front page of Ka N≈´pepa K≈´ ªoko ªa Here We Are Again, negative portrayal of the 1901 Hawaii Territorial Legislature in The Pacific Commercial Advertiser The Home Rule Party controlled Territorial Legislature of 1901 has been negatively cast as an ineffective and chaotic in the historical narrative of Hawaii, although recent scholarship have painted a different picture. During the period they controlled both chambers of the legislature. They attempted to pass new laws in the interest of the local people, who included Hawaiian taro farmers, patients of the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement and victims of the 1900 Chinatown fire, among others. In total, fifty-one bills were introduced in the Senate and one hundred and twenty-six in the House, although only nineteen bills were submitted by both houses for ratification. They proposed creating a government-funded education program for poor Hawaiian students similar to the Education of Hawaiian Youths Abroad program initiated during the reign of King KalƒÅkaua. A pension for the deposed Queen Lili‚Äòuokalani and appropriation to repair the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii were also proposed. They insisted on the use of both Hawaiian and English in the legislature with the aide of an interpreter, ignoring the Organic Act which mandated the sole use of English in the legislature. Many of the legislators in this session did not speak English. However, their agenda was obstructed by the Republicans and the appointed members of territorial government, especially Governor Sanford B. Dole. In this session, the Home Rulers attempted to decentralize control away from the governor and empower local government by passing a bill creating the first counties in Hawaii. The bill would have created five counties: County of Lunalilo (Kauai and Niihau), County of Liliuokalani (Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe), County of Kauikeouli (Hawaii including Hilo, Puna and Kau), County of Kamehameha (Hawaii including Hamakua, North Kohala, South Kohala, South Kona and North Kona), county, County of Kalohana (Oahu). This county bill was defeated by Dole through a pocket veto after the prorogation of the regular session. The legislative assembly was later mockingly dubbed the \\"Lady Dog Legislature\\" because of extensive legislative debate on House Bill No. 15, An Act To Amend Section 814, Chapter 59, of the Civil Laws, by Representative Simon H. Haaheo which would have repealed an 1898 tax on ownership of female dogs. This nickname was used by opponents of the Home Rulers to denigrate the group and the difficulties of the 1901 legislature would later be used as evidence of the incompetence of Native Hawaiian political leadership.; ; Decline Charles Kahiliaulani Notley, 1906 On July 10, 1902, Prince Kuhio split from the Home Rule Party, walking out of its convention along with nearly half of the delegates there. He formed the short-lived Hui Kuokoa Party. However, by September 1, 1902, Kuhio decided to join the Republican Party, was nominated as their candidate for Congress, and dramatically altered the political landscape. Election day, November 4, 1902, proved to be devastating to the Home Rule Party. Republicans won 26 legislative seats, the Home Rulers 9, and the Democrats one. After Wilcox's death, the party ran Charles Kahiliaulani Notley against Kuhio for another decade losing the election each time. The party steadily lost ground to the Republican party in the legislative and county elections. However, they still ran candidates during each election. For example, Maui politician William P≈´nohu White ran unsuccessfully in every election to regain the senate seat after his brief stint in the first Territorial legislature. The Home Rule Party eventually went onto disband in 1912 Aloha Aina Party In 1997 the Aloha Aina Party of Hawaii was established by UH dance instructor Vickie Holt Takamine as a putative reestablishment of the Home Rule Party. The party philosophy is Conservationism and nationalism.

His short reign was characterised by disputes with the Archbishopric of Bremen over church policies, and a historically debated delimitation of the Swedish- Danish border. Way to the throne Emund was the son of Olof Sk√∂tkonung, the first Christian ruler of Sweden. His mother was a co-wife,Adam av Bremen (1984), Historien om Hamburgstiftet och dess biskopar. Stockholm: Proprius, p. 103 (Book II, Chapter 59). Edla, daughter of a Slavic chief from the southern coast of the Baltic Sea. He had two uterine sisters called Astrid and Holmfrid. His half-siblings, born by Olof's legitimate Queen Estrid of the Obotrites, were Anund Jacob and Ingegerd. According to the 13th-century historian Snorri Sturluson, Estrid was ill-tempered and treated her stepchildren poorly. King Olof later sent Emund to be raised with his mother's Slavic family. While staying there he failed to hold on to the Christian religion.Snorre Sturluson (1992), Nordiska kungasagor: Olav den heliges saga. Stockholm: Fabel, p. 107-8 (Olav the Saint's Saga, Chapter 88). Olof was succeeded by his other son Anund Jacob, who however did not have any known sons of his own. Snorri relates that Emund was ruling in Sigtuna, an important center in the Swedish realm, by 1035.Snorre Sturluson (1993), Nordiska kungasagor: Magnus den gode till Magnus Erlingsson. Stockholm: Fabel, p. 19 (Magnus the Good's Saga, Chapter 1). However, other sources show that Anund Jacob was still alive then; the names Anund and Emund might have been mixed up.Oscar Montelius (1919), Sveriges historia till v√•ra dagar, F√∂rsta delen. Stockholm: P.A. Norstedt & S√∂ners F√∂rlag, p. 293-4. The German ecclesiastical chronicler Adam of Bremen, in his Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church), says that Anund Jacob died in or shortly after 1049 and was succeeded by Emund; there is nothing to suggest that the succession was irregular.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 138 (Book III, Chapter 15). Conflict with Bremen Our only near-contemporary source for Emund's reign is Adam of Bremen, who paints a very negative picture of the new ruler. This is mainly due to the self-willed attitude of Emund vis-√†-vis the Archdiocese of Bremen. Adam relates that Emund was baptised but cared very little for the Christian faith. He also gives Emund the cognomen pessimus (worst), which is later reflected by the short chronicle of the Westrogothic law (c. 1240) which likewise knows the king as Slemme, the bad.Peter Sawyer (1991), N√§r Sverige blev Sverige. Alings√•s: Viktoria Bokf√∂rlag, p. 34. The Westrogothic law states that Emund was a disagreeable man when wanting to pursue a goal.Yngre V√§stg√∂talagen The dispute with Bremen was triggered by Emund's insistence on maintaining a bishop called Osmundus. Originally a proteg√© of the Norwegian-based missionary Sigfrid, Osmundus had been raised at a school in Bremen but failed to be ordained bishop by the Pope. Eventually he was ordained by the Polish archbishop of Gniezno and proceeded to Sweden where he won the confidence of King Emund. In the mid-1050s the Archbishop of Bremen sent envoys to Sweden, headed by Adalvard the Elder who was intended as the new bishop. The delegation was highly offended when encountering Osmundus who sported the habits of an archbishop and \\"seduced the still recently converted wild peoples through incorrect education in our faith\\". On Osmundus' insistence, Emund turned the envoys away from an assembly. However, the Swedish magnate Stenkil, a relation of the king, escorted the delegation on its way back.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 139-40 (Book III, Chapter 15) Time of calamities Some time after the schism, King Emund dispatched his son Anund with an army \\"in order to expand the realm\\". The Viking expedition crossed the sea and came, according to Adam, to Terra Feminarum, the Land of Women. Adam places this somewhere in Scythia. Modern scholars have assumed that the term alludes to Kvenland which was probably situated to the east of the Gulf of Bothnia in present-day Finland (Kven could have been mixed up with the Nordic word kvinna, woman). \\"The women\\", says Adam, \\"immediately mixed poison in the springwater, and in that way brought death to the king himself and his army.\\" The passage implies that Anund bore the title of king together with his father.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 140 (Book III, Chapter 15); p. 248 (Book IV, Scholion 123). The military disaster was paired with a severe drought and failed harvests. This crop failure can be dated to 1056 from other sources.P.A. Munch (1855), Det norske Folks historie. Anden Deel, Christiania: Tonsbergs, p. 192. Allegedly, the calamities caused the Swedes to turn to the Archbishop of Bremen and ask to receive Adalvard back as Bremen-appointed bishop. Adalvard duly arrived to Sweden where he devoted his efforts to the conversion of V√§rmland towards the border of Norway. Osmundus appears to have submitted to Adalvard in the end, but left Sweden for England some time before 1066.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 143 (Book III, Chapter 16); p. 201 (Book IV, Paragraph F); Peter Sawyer (1991), p. 34). It has been assumed on very loose grounds that he was the same person as √Ösmund K√•resson, a prominent carver of runic inscriptions in Uppland.Sture Bolin, \\"Emund gamle\\", Svenskt biografiskt lexikon One of the latter's inscription includes the passage \\"√Ösmund K√•resson carved runes right. Then sat Emund\\". There has been much speculation that this refers to Emund sitting on the throne.Oscar Montelius (1919), p. 294-5. Delimitation of the border Little is known about the relationship between Sweden and its Nordic neighbours in King Emund's time. He may have continued his brother Anund Jacob's support for the Danish king Sweyn Estridsen against Harald Hardrada of Norway.Erik Gunnes (1976), Norges historie. Bind 2. Oslo: Cappelen, p. 283. A memorandum about an early delimitation of the Swedish- Danish border has been preserved in a large number of medieval Swedish manuscripts. The text states that \\"Emund Slemme was the King in Uppsala, and Sweyn Forkbeard in Denmark. They placed boundary-marks between Sweden [Sueriki] and Denmark. Now is enumerated Ragnvalde of Tiundaland, Botvid of H√§lsingland, Bote of Fj√§rdhundraland, Grimalde of √ñsterg√∂tland, Tole and Tote and Tokke of Jutland, Gunkil of Sjaelland, Dan of Scania, Grimulf of Grimeton in Halland. They placed six stones between the two kingdoms. The first stone stands in Snutruase, the second in Danab√§ck, the third one is Kinna sten, the fourth in Uraksnaes, the fifth Vita sten, the sixth is Br√∂mse sten between Blekinge and M√∂re.\\"Peter Sawyer (1991), p. 72. The memorandum is followed by a story about a meeting between the three Nordic kings on Danaholmen where the Danish king held the bridle of the Swedish king's horse, while the Norwegian king held his stirrups, thus seemingly acknowledging the precedence of the Uppsala king.P.A. Munch (1855), p. 173. In older historiography it was usually assumed that the province of Blekinge was transferred from Sweden to Denmark at this occasion.Sture Bolin, \\"Emund Gamle\\", Svenskt biografiskt lexikon A late 9th-century source alleges that Blekinge belonged to the Swedes at that time, while medieval sources make clear that it belonged to Denmark. Modern scholarship has questioned this, since there is even doubt if Blekinge was considered Danish in the 1060s.Peter Sawyer (1991), p. 68. Adam says that Sk√•ne in his time was \\"the furthest part of Denmark\\" and bordered to the land of the Swedes; Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 208 (Book IV, Chapter 7). Moreover, the veracity of the memorandum has been put into doubt by Peter Sawyer on various grounds. Emund the Old and Sweyn Forkbeard were not contemporaries (though the king at the time was another Sweyn, Sweyn Estridsen [1047-1074]), and some particularities might fit High medieval conditions better. According to Sawyer the memorandum may have been authored by Danish people in the first half of the 13th century, in order to prove the early origins of the Danish claims to Halland and Blekinge.Peter Sawyer (1991), p. 70. Some other historians have nevertheless defended the genuine character of the text and dated it to c. 1050.Lars Gahrn (1988), Sveariket i k√§llor och historieskrivning. PhD thesis, G√∂teborgs universitet. Family and succession Emund's wife is not explicitly mentioned in the sources. Through a combination of information from the Hervarar saga and Adam of Bremen, it has sometimes been assumed that he was married to Astrid Njalsdotter of Skjalga√§tten (d. 1060).Hans Gillingstam (1981), \\"Utomnordiskt och nordiskt i de √§ldsta svenska dynastiska f√∂rbindelserna\\", Personhistorisk tidskrift 77:1, p. 18 Astrid was the daughter of Norwegian nobleman Nial Finnsson (d. 1011), son of Gunhild Halvdansdotter of the Skjalga family in H√•logaland, Norway. Emund sired two known children with his consort: Anund who died before his father, and a daughter, whose name is not known but who was the Queen Consort of King Stenkil of Sweden and the mother of two more Swedish kings, Inge I and Halsten.Stenkil, Kung i Sverige (Nordisk familjebok) The cognomen \\"Gamle\\" is known from Adam of Bremen, although he mistakes it as a proper name and mentions in one episode a \\"King Gamle\\" when it is in fact Emund. The name means \\"old\\" and could signify that he was old when he became king or that he was the older brother to his predecessor Anund Jakob. Emund was the last king of the ancient royal house of the Swedes (sometimes known in modern history writing as the House of Muns√∂). He is known to have been alive as late as the summer of 1060, and probably died shortly after.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 275. Adam of Bremen relates in his work that Emund was succeeded by his \\"nephew or stepson\\", in fact probably son-in law, Stenkil. With him began a new dynasty that would last until the 1120s.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 140-3 (Book III, Chapter 15-16). The Hervarar saga (13th century) says that Emund was king only a short time: {  Eymundr h√©t annarr sonr √ìl√°fs s√¶nska, er konungd√≥m t√≥k eptir br√≥√∞ur sinn. Um hans daga heldu Sv√≠ar illa kristnina. Eymundr var litla hr√≠√∞ konungr.Hervarar saga ok Hei√∞reks, Gu√∞ni J√≥nsson's og Bjarni Vilhj√°lmsson's edition at ¬´Norr√∏ne Tekster og Kvad¬ª.  Olaf the Swede had another son called Eymund, who came to the throne after his brother. In his day the Swedes neglected the Christian religion, but he was King for only a short time.The Saga of Herv√∂r and Heithrek, in Stories and Ballads of the Far Past, translated from the Norse (Icelandic and Faroese), by N.

History Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed bankruptcy in 1938. After the bankruptcy reorganization, REO exited the car business to concentrate on trucks but continued to suffer losses. In December 1954, REO sold its entire manufacturing operations to Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation. The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed \\"Nuclear Corporation of America Inc.\\", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase & Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. In March 1965, the company filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his business jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become CFO, conditions the Board accepted. Iverson and Siegel reorganized Nucor around its only profitable business, the steel fabricator Vulcraft. All other businesses were either sold or liquidated. In 1966, the company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina to be closer to its main Vulcraft plant. In 1968, unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson, a metallurgist by training, decided to extend Nucor vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a $6 million loan secured by all of the company's assets. Production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972. In 1972, the company, recognizing that it was misnamed, adopted its current name. Since that time, Nucor has expanded into other steel products, gained some control of its raw material supply, became a leader in recycling technology, and expanded its market presence. Decrease in cost of production by EAFs and market demand for low price raw material especially rebars, attracted Nucor not only to produce steel for itself but also selling it to companies in vicinity that otherwise were importing steel. In 1988, Nucor became the first minimill to manufacture wide flange beams with a depth of 40\\". The company opened its building products division that same year. In 1989, Nucor opened a facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which was the first mini mill to produce flat rolled steel using thin-slab technology. In March 2000, a joint venture, owned 47.5% by Nucor, 47.5% by BlueScope, and 5% by IHI Corporation was formed to license Castrip technology. This technology allows for continuous casting of sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy- consuming rollers. As a result, mills built with this technology are significantly cheaper and take up significantly less space than other mills. In September 2000, Dan DiMicco, formerly the general manager of the company's highly profitable Nucor-Yamato Steel joint venture, was appointed CEO. In the years that followed, the company made several acquisitions. In 2001, the company acquired Auburn Steel, its first acquisition in 36 years. In 2002, Nucor bought Birmingham Steel, including the Mississippi Steel plant and Birmingham, Alabama, operations. In 2004, Nucor acquired Corus Tuscaloosa. and in 2005, Nucor purchased Fort Howard Steel and Marion Steel. In 2006, Nucor acquired Connecticut Steel, Verco Decking, and Harris Steel. The $1.07 billion acquisition of Harris Steel expanded Nucor into production of fabricated rebar, a strong market due to increased spending on infrastructure. In 2007, the company's Nucor Building Systems division acquired Magnatrax, which bolstered its share of the pre-engineered metal building systems market. In March 2008, in order to take more control of its raw material supply and prices, Nucor purchased the David J. Joseph Company, one of the largest scrap brokers and recycling companies in the United States. In 2012, Nucor purchased Skyline Steel. Effective January 1, 2013, John J. Ferriola was named as Chief Executive Officer of Nucor and Daniel R. DiMicco was named Executive Chairman. DiMicco retired effective January 1, 2014. In 2014, the company purchased Gallatin Steel Company. In 2015, the company acquired additional cold finish bar facilities in Ohio and Georgia. In 2016, Nucor announced the acquisition of a steel plate mill in Longview, Texas, and structural tube mills in Mississippi, Alabama, and Illinois. The acquisition of these facilities expanded Nucor's capabilities in the plate market and added structural tube to the company's product mix. In April 2017, the company announced an $85 million upgrade of the rolling mill at its Marion, Ohio rebar and signpost operation. In August 2017, the company acquired St. Louis Cold Drawn, Inc.

Until the rapid multiplication in the number of swing bands from 1935 on, the Casa Loma Orchestra was one of the top North American dance bands. With the decline of the big band business following the end of World War II, it disbanded in 1947. However, from 1957 to 1963, it re-emerged as a recording session band in Hollywood, made up of top-flight studio musicians under the direction of its most notable leader of the past, Glen Gray. The reconstituted band made a limited number appearances live and on television and recorded fifteen LP albums for Capitol Records before Gray died in 1963. History The band assembled in 1927 as the Orange Blossoms, one of several Detroit groups that came out of the Jean Goldkette office. The band adopted the name \\"Casa Loma\\" by the time of its first recordings in 1929, shortly after it played an eight-month engagement at Casa Loma in Toronto, which was being operated as a hotel at the time. The band never played at Casa Loma under that name, still appearing as the Orange Blossoms at that time. In 1930, the Casa Loma Orchestra was incorporated in New York with the members becoming owners, shareholders, and board members. The band members were hired on the grounds of \\"musical and congenial\\" competence and followed strict conduct and financial rules. Because the band operated as a collective group, as opposed to almost all other bands that had a \\"leader\\" for whom everyone worked, the band maintained a stable collection of personnel that varied little. Members who broke the rules could be summoned before the \\"board\\", have their contract bought out, and be ejected from the band. The band was led for the first few years by violinist Hank Biagini, although the eventual leader, saxophonist Glen Gray (1900 ‚Äì 1963) was from the beginning \\"first among equals.\\" The complex arrangements called for talented musicians such as trombonist Pee Wee Hunt, guitarist S. Jack Blanchette, trumpeter Frank L. Ryerson, trumpeter Sonny Dunham, clarinetist Clarence Hutchenrider, drummer Tony Briglia and singer Kenny Sargent. Arrangements were by Gene Gifford, who also composed much of the band's book, Spud Murphy, Larry Wagner, Salvador \\"Tutti\\" Camarata and Horace Henderson. Gifford's arrangements were credited in large part to giving the band its sound, but even he fell victim to the band's strict rules, being bought out in 1935 due to alcohol-related infractions. The band's manager, Cork O'Keefe, was made a Vice President in the corporation and arranged bookings in venues such as Glen Island casino, which they helped popularize, and the Essex House Hotel, that led to their increasing fame via radio broadcasts before and throughout the swing era of 1935‚Äì1946. In 1944, Eugenie Baird became \\"the first girl vocalist ever featured\\" with the Casa Loma Orchestra. Radio Their mid-1930s appearances on the long-run radio comedy-variety program, the Camel Caravan (introduced with their theme, \\"Smoke Rings\\") increased their popularity. Gray chose not to conduct the band in the early years, playing in the saxophone section while violinist Mel Jenssen acted as conductor. In 1937, the band overwhelmingly voted in favor of Glen leading the orchestra, and Gray finally accepted the job. Hits included \\"Casa Loma Stomp,\\" \\"No Name Jive\\" and \\"Maniac's Ball\\". Part of the reason for the band's decline is that other big bands included in their books hard-swinging numbers emulating the hot Casa Loma style. In the late 1930s Gray took top billing, and by the mid-1940s (as the other original players left) Gray would come to own the band and the Casa Loma name. For a time, during this period, the band featured guitarist Herb Ellis, trumpeter Bobby Hackett, pianist Nick Denucci and cornetist Red Nichols. By 1950, the Casa Loma band had ceased touring, Gray retired to Massachusetts, and the later recordings on Capitol (beginning with Casa Loma in Hi-Fi in 1956 and continuing through the Sounds of the Great Bands series) were done by studio musicians in Hollywood (with several of Gray's \\"alumni\\" occasionally featured). Recordings In October 1929, the band debuted on Okeh Records. The following year, they signed with Brunswick where they recorded until 1934. They briefly recorded for Victor in 1933 as \\"Glen Gray and his Orchestra\\", the Casa Loma name being under contract to Brunswick. In late 1934, they followed Jack Kapp to the newly formed Decca Records and stayed there well into the LP era when they signed with Capitol. Most of the Okeh's and many of the Brunswick's were out-and-out jazz (albeit very rehearsed) and remain highly collectible. Film In 1942, the orchestra made a Warner Bros. short film, Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra, that featured the songs \\"Hep and Happy,\\" \\"Purple Moonlight,\\" \\"Broom Street\\" and \\"Darktown Strutters Ball.\\" Universal Studios produced a short subject, Smoke Rings, that featured the Casa Loma Orchestra. Released July 28, 1943, the film featured Eugenie Baird, Pee Wee Hunt, and The Pied Pipers. It included the songs \\"Can't Get Stuff in Your Cuff,\\" \\"That's My Affair\\" and \\"Little Man with the Hammer.\\" The band also appeared in Jam Session (1944), where they played their famous \\"No Name Jive.\\" The orchestra's 1937 recording \\"Girl of My Dreams\\" was presented in the 1987 film Angel Heart with the fictional title \\"Life Would Be Complete\\" by the fictional crooner Johnny Favorite, and elements of the tune were incorporated into the score.

Biography At an early age, Juan D√≠az Canales became interested in comics and their creation, which progressed and broadened out to include animated films. At the age of 18, he entered a school for animation. In 1996 he founded, together with three other artists, a company called Tridente Animation. Through this, he has worked with European and American companies, providing plots and scripts for comics and animation films, as well as directing animated television series and animation movies. During this period he met Juanjo Guarnido, with whom Canales decided to create comics based around a private investigator, Blacksad. After contacting several editors, Guarnido and Canales finally signed on with French publisher Dargaud, and in November 2000, Quelque part entre les ombres (Somewhere within the Shadows) was published. It was a great success with both critics and the public, and was awarded the Prix de la D√©couverte at the Sierre International Comics Festival and the \\"Avenir\\" Prize at the Lys-lez-Lannoy Festival, in Switzerland and France respectively. In March 2003 the second album Arctic- Nation, was released. It was once again a great success, winning the Angoul√™me Audience Award and the Festival Prize for Artwork in 2004.

Seal of the Scribe and acronym for Chiddushei Toiras Moishe Sofer), was one of the leading Orthodox rabbis of European Jewry in the first half of the nineteenth century. He was a teacher to thousands and a powerful opponent of the Reform movement in Judaism, which was attracting many people from the Jewish communities in the Austrian Empire, and beyond. As Rav of the city of Pressburg, he maintained a strong Orthodox Jewish perspective through communal life, first-class education, and uncompromising opposition to Reform and radical change.Great Leaders of Our People: Rabbi Moshe Sofer (The Chasam Sofer) Sofer established a yeshiva in Pozsony (Pressburg in German; today Bratislava, Slovakia), the Pressburg Yeshiva, which became the most influential yeshiva in Central Europe, producing hundreds of future leaders of Hungarian Jewry.Crash Course in Jewish History: Pale of Settlement, aish.com This yeshiva continued to function until World War II; afterward, it was relocated to Jerusalem, under the leadership of the Chasam Sofer's great-grandson, Rabbi Akiva Sofer (the Daas Sofer). Sofer published very little during his lifetime; however, his post-humously published works include more than a thousand responsa, novellae on the Talmud, sermons, biblical and liturgical commentaries, and religious poetry. He is an authority who is quoted many times in Orthodox Jewish scholarship. Many of his responsa are required reading for semicha (rabbinic ordination) candidates. His Torah chiddushim (original Torah insights) sparked a new style in rabbinic commentary, and some editions of the Talmud contain his emendations and additions. Early years Sofer was born in Frankfurt am Main, on September 24, 1762, during the Seven Years' War (8 Tishrei 5523 on the Hebrew calendar). His father's name was Shmuel (Samuel) (d. 1779, 15 Sivan 5539), and his mother's name was Reizel, the daughter of Elchanan. This 32-volume collection of transcribed genealogical records of the Jewish community of Frankfurt am Main, covering the years 1241 to 1824 is available at the Leo Baeck Institute. Additional details about the work can be seen in the December 1996 issue (no. 11) of 'Stammbaum, the newsletter of German-Jewish Genealogical Research (d. 1822, 17 Adar 5582). Shmuel's mother, Reizchen (d. 5 May 1731 in Frankfurt am Main), was a daughter of the Gaon of Frankfurt, Rabbi Shmuel Schotten, known as the Marsheishoch (d. 1719, 14 Tamuz 5479 in Frankfurt am Main), his namesake. Education At the age of nine, Sofer entered the yeshiva of Rabbi Nathan Adler (1741‚Äì1800, d. 27 Elul 5560) at Frankfurt, a kabbalist known for his strict and unusual ritual practices. At the age of thirteen, Sofer began to deliver public lectures. His knowledge was so extraordinary that Rabbi Pinchas Horowitz of Frankfurt asked him to become his pupil. He agreed, but remained under Rabbi Horowitz for only one year, and left in 1776 for the yeshiva of Rabbi David Tebele Scheuer (1712‚Äì1782, d. Shemini Atzeret 5543) in the neighboring city of Mainz. There he studied under its Rosh yeshiva Rabbi Mechel Scheuer (1739-1810, d. 27 Shevat 5570), son of Rabbi Tebele, during the years 1776 and 1777 until he yielded to the entreaties of his former teachers in Frankfurt and returned to his native city. In Mainz many prominent residents took an interest in his welfare and facilitated the progress of his studies. First positions and marriage In 1782, Rabbi Nathan Adler was called to the rabbinate of Boskovice, Moravia, and Sofer followed him. He went, at Rabbi Adler's advice, to Prostƒõjov, Moravia. There, on 6 May 1787, Sofer married Sarah, the daughter of Rabbi Moses Jerwitz (d. 1785), the late rabbi of Prostƒõjov. Following their engagement, Rabbi Sofer's family learned that Sarah was a widow who did not bear children to her first husband, and pressed him to break the engagement. Rabbi Sofer wrote to his teacher, Rabbi Adler, for advice, but no response was received prior to the wedding date. Rabbi Sofer took this as a heavenly sign that the wedding should take place, and married Sarah over his family's objections. Sofer became a member of the Chevra kadisha (Shu\\"t Chatam Sofer, Y\\"D:327), and eventually became head of the yeshiva in Prostƒõjov. In 1794, Sofer accepted his first official position, becoming Rabbi of Str√°≈ænice, after he had procured the sanction of the government to settle in that town. In 1797 he was appointed Rabbi of Mattersdorf (currently Mattersburg, Austria); one of the seven communities (known as the Siebengemeinden or Sheva kehillot) of Burgenland. There he established a yeshiva, and pupils flocked to him. His prime pupil in Mattersdorf was the future Gaon Rabbi Meir Ash (Maharam Ash) (1780‚Äì1852), Rabbi of Uzhhorod. Pressburg (Bratislava) Sofer declined many offers for the rabbinate, but in 1806 accepted a call to Pressburg (Pozsony in Hungarian, today Bratislava, capital of Slovakia). There he established a yeshiva, which was attended by as many as 500 pupils. Hundreds of these pupils became the rabbis of Hungarian Jewry.

Second marriage and children Sofer's first wife Sarah died childless on 22 July 1812. In 1812 (23 Cheshvan 5573), he married for the second time to Sarel (Sarah) (1790‚Äì1832, d. 18 Adar II 5592), the widowed daughter of Rabbi Akiva Eger, Rav of Pozna≈Ñ. She was the widow of Rabbi Avraham Moshe Kalischer (1788‚Äì1812), Rabbi of Pi≈Ça, the son of Rabbi Yehuda Kalischer, author of Hayod Hachazoka. With his second wife, Sofer had three sons and seven daughters. All three of his sons became rabbis: Avrohom Shmuel Binyamin Sofer (known as the Ktav Sofer or Ksav Sofer); Shimon Sofer (known as the Michtav Sofer), who became the Rav of Krak√≥w; and Yozef Yozpa Sofer.\\"The Chasam Sofer\\" , (Yated Neeman, Monsey) Sofer's descendants named their works after the Hebrew translation of Schreiber (scribe), Sofer's civil surname, along the lines of Sofer's work Chasam Sofer; as, for instance, Michtav Sofer (son), Ktav Sofer (son), the Shevet Sofer (grandson), the Chasan Sofer (grandson), the Yad Sofer (great-grandson), the Daas Sofer (great-grandson), the Cheshev Sofer and Imrei Sofer (2xgreat-grandson). Sofer and his family lived at the end of Zamocka Street, where the Hotel Ibis is now located. Influence against changes in Judaism Painting of the Chasam Sofer. Sofer led the community of Pressburg for 33 years, until his death in 1839. It was his influence and determination that kept the Reform movement out of the city. From the late 18th century onwards, movements which eventually developed into Reform Judaism began to develop. Synagogues subscribing to these new views began to appear in centres such as Berlin and Hamburg. Sofer was profoundly opposed to the reformers, and attacked them in his speeches and writings. For example, in a responsum of 1816, he forbade the congregation in Vienna to allow a performance in the synagogue of a cantata they had commissioned from the composer Ignaz Moscheles, because it would involve a mixed choir. In the same spirit, he contested the founders of the Reformschule (Reform synagogue) in Pozsony, which was established in the year 1827. For Sofer, Judaism as previously practiced was the only form of Judaism acceptable. In his view, the rules and tenets of Judaism had never changed ‚Äî and cannot ever change. This became the defining idea for the opponents to Reform, and in some form, it has continued to influence the Orthodox response to innovation in Jewish doctrine and practice. Sofer applied a pun to the Talmudic term chadash asur min haTorah, \\"'new' is forbidden by the Torah\\" (referring literally to eating chadash, \\"new grain\\", before the Omer offering is given) as a slogan heralding his opposition to any philosophical, social or practical change to customary Orthodox practice. He did not allow the addition of any secular studies to the curriculum of his Pressburg Yeshiva. =Universal Israelite Congress= The Universal Israelite Congress of 1868-69 in Pest was influential in affecting the direction of Judaism in Europe. To try to unify all streams of Judaism under one constitution, the Orthodox offered the Shulchan Aruch and surrounding codes as the ruling code of law and observance. The reformists dismissed this notation and in response, many Orthodox rabbis resigned from the Congress to form their own social and political groups. Hungarian Jewry split into two major institutionally sectarian groups, Orthodox and Neolog. Some communities refused to join either of the groups and called themselves Status Quo. Actions of students and descendants Sofer's most notable student Rabbi Moshe Schick, together with Sofer's sons, the rabbis Shmuel Binyamin and Shimon, took an active role in arguing against the Reform movement. They showed relative tolerance for heterogeneity within the Orthodox camp. Others, such as the more zealous Rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein, supported a more stringent position in orthodoxy. Rabbi Moshe Schick demonstrated support in 1877 for the separatist policies of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch in Germany. His son studied at the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary, which taught secular studies and was headed by Azriel Hildesheimer. Hirsch, however, did not reciprocate. He was surprised at what he described as Schick's halakhic contortions in condemning even those status quo communities that clearly adhered to halakhah.\\"Schick, Mosheh\\", YIVO Encyclopedia Hillel Lichtenstein opposed Hildesheimer and his son Hirsh in their speaking German to give sermons and their tending toward Modern Zionism.Jewish Gen In 1871, Shimon Sofer, Chief Rabbi of Krak√≥w, founded the Machzikei Hadas organisation with the Chassidic Rabbi Yehoshua Rokeach of Belz. This was the first effort of Haredi Jews in Europe to create a political party; it was part of the developing identification of the traditional Orthodoxy as a self-defined group. Rabbi Shimon was nominated as a candidate to the Polish Regional Parliament under the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph. He was elected to the \\"Polish Club,\\" in which he took an active part until his death. Another notable group is Satmar, which was founded by rabbi Moshe Teitelbaum (Ujhel), who was a chassid who paid homage to the Chasam Sofer and had similar views to that of rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein. His descendant rabbi Joel Teitelbaum headed the Edah HaChareidis for many years, living in Israel and later in the United States, where he influenced Orthodox Jewry. Starting in 1830, about twenty disciples of Sofer settled in Palestine, almost all of them in Jerusalem. They joined the Old Yishuv, which comprised the Musta'arabim, Sephardim and Ashkenazim. They also settled in Safed, Tiberias and Hebron. Together with the Perushim and Hassidim, they formed an approach to Judaism reflecting those of their European counterparts. Notable disciples of the Pressburg Yeshiva who had major influence on mainstream orthodoxy in Palestine were Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld (student of Ktav Sofer) and Rabbi Yitzchok Yerucham Diskin (son of Rabbi Yehoshua Leib Diskin, from Brisk, Lithuania), who together in 1919 founded the Edah HaChareidis in then-Mandate Palestine. In 1932 Sonnenfeld was succeeded by Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky, a disciple of the Shevet Sofer, one of Sofer's grandchildren. Dushinsky founded the Dushinsky Hasidic dynasty in Israel based on Sofer's teachings. Death and burial place Interior of the memorial in Bratislava, Slovakia (the grave of the Chasam Sofer is at the left). Sofer died in Pressburg on 3 October 1839 (25 Tishrei 5600). Today, a modern Jewish memorial, containing Sofer's grave and those of many of his associates and family, is located in Bratislava. It is situated underground below Bratislava Castle on the left bank of the Danube). The nearby tram and bus stop is named after him. The preservation of these graves has a curious history. The Jewish cemetery in Bratislava was confiscated during the regime in 1943 to build a roadway. Negotiations with the regime enabled the community to preserve the section of the cemetery including Sofer's grave, enclosed in concrete, below the surface of the new road. The regime complied, possibly as a consequence of a large bribe (according to one story), foreign pressure (according to another story), or for fear of a curse if the graves were destroyed (according to yet another story). Following the declaration of independence by Slovakia in 1992, new negotiations were undertaken to restore public access to the preserved graves. In the mid-1990s, the International Committee for Preservation of Gravesites of Geonai Pressburg was formed to support and oversee relocation of tram tracks and building of a mausoleum. Construction of the mausoleum was completed after overcoming numerous technical and religious issues and opened on 8 July 2002. Access to the mausoleum can be arranged through the local Jewish community organisation. Legacy Many synagogues and yeshivas worldwide bear the name and follow the legacy of the Chatam Sofer. =Erlau yeshiva and community= Rabbi Yochanan Sofer The most notable recent living descendant and heir to the Sofer legacy was rabbi Yochanan Sofer. Yochanan was a direct descendant and fifth generation to the Chatam Sofer. He was the leader of the Erlau movement whose progenitor was his grandfather Rabbi Shimon Sofer of Erlau, a grandson of the Chatam Sofer, and son of the Ktav Sofer. Yochanan's father, rabbi Moshe Sofer (II) (Dayan of Erlau) and grandfather rabbi Shimon (Av Beth Din of Erlau) perished in the Holocaust together with most of their families. After the Holocaust, Rabbi Yochanan refounded the Chasam Sofer Yeshiva in Pest together with rabbi Moshe Stern (the Debretziner Rav) and his brother Avraham Shmuel Binyamin (II). He then returned to Eger (Erlau) to re-establish his grandfather's Yeshiva. In 1950 he immigrated to Israel together with his students and for a short while merged his yeshiva with the Pressburg Yeshiva of rabbi Akiva Sofer (Daas Sofer). In 1953 he founded his own Yeshiva in Katamon, Jerusalem, as well as the Institute for Research of the Teachings of the Chasam Sofer. The Institute researches and deciphers handwritten documents penned by the Chasam Sofer, his pupils and descendants and has printed hundreds of sefarim. Over the years, Rabbi Yochanan founded many synagogues, chederim and kollelim, which he named after his ancestors. The Ezrat Torah Campus in Jerusalem is named Beth Chasam Sofer, as is the Erlau Synagogue in Haifa. The chederim are named Talmud Torah Ksav Sofer after the Chasam Sofer's son; the kollelim and synagogues are named Yad Sofer after rabbi Yochanan's father and the main yeshiva campus in Katamon is named Ohel Shimon MiErlau after his grandfather. He has authored numerous Torah commentary works, naming them Imrei Sofer. The Erlau community is considered Hassidic style, though strictly follows Ashkenaz customs as did the Chasam Sofer. It has branches in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Beitar Illit, El'ad, Haifa, Ashdod and Boro Park (New York). =The Pressburg Yeshiva of Jerusalem= The Pressburg Yeshiva of Jerusalem () is a leading yeshiva located in the Givat Shaul neighborhood of Jerusalem, Israel. It was founded in 1950 by rabbi Akiva Sofer (known as the Daas Sofer), a great-grandson of rabbi Moses Sofer (the Chasam Sofer), who established the original Pressburg Yeshiva in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in 1807. , the rosh yeshiva is rabbi Simcha Bunim Sofer. The yeshiva building includes a Yeshiva Ketana, Yeshiva Gedolah, and kollel. The main beis medrash doubles as a synagogue where some neighborhood residents also pray on Shabbat. The complex also includes a general neighborhood synagogue which functions as Givat Shaul's main nusach Ashkenaz synagogue. =Chasan Sofer Yeshiva, New York= The Chassan Sofer Yeshiva in New York is considered the American yeshiva of the Chasam Sofer legacy. It was founded by rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld who was born and raised in Mattersdorf, Austria. His father Simcha Bunim Ehrenfeld, the rabbi of Mattersdorf, whose father, rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld (the Chasan Sofer), was a grandson of the Chasam Sofer. Rabbi Shmuel was rabbi of Mattersdorf from 1926 until 1938 when the congregation was dispersed by the Nazis. He escaped to America and immediately reestablished the Chasan Sofer Yeshiva in the Lower East Side, from where it was later relocated to Boro Park. After his death he was succeeded by his son, rabbi Simcha Bunim Ehrenfeld. The yeshiva currently enrolls over 400 students in kindergarten through twelfth grade and operates a Head Start Program and rabbinical seminary. =Chug Chasam Sofer, Bnei Brak= During the 1950s and 1960s many synagogues in Israel were built by Hungarian Jewry and named Chug Chasam Sofer. This network of synagogues were founded in Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak, Jerusalem, Petach Tikva, Haifa and Netanya. These synagogues still operate but have been integrated into the larger community with no distinct character of their own. Besides for that of Bnei Brak founded by rabbi Yitzchak Shlomo Ungar and that of Petach Tikva founded by Rabbi Shmaryahu Deutch. Rabbi Ungar, a descendant of the Chasam Sofer, founded a Yeshiva named Machneh Avraham and a kashrut organization named Chug Chasam Sofer which are both very active and well known. After Rabbi Ungar's passing in 1994 the yeshiva appointed Rabbi Altman as rabbi and rosh yeshiva, with Rabbi Shmuel Eliezer Stern remaining the head of the kashrut organisation.:he:◊ó◊ï◊í ◊ó◊™\\"◊ù ◊°◊ï◊§◊® =Pressburg Institutions of London= The Pressburg institutions in London, England are headed by a descendant of the Chasam Sofer, Rabbi Shmuel Ludmir (who has published some of his work).◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊°◊ï◊§◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ó◊ú◊ß ◊ê' ◊ë' ◊í' , ◊ñ◊û◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ï◊õ◊ï =Dushinsky, Jerusalem= The Dushinsky Community considers itself a continuation of the Chasam Sofer dynasty, not by genealogy, but rather by school of thought.

The Dushinsky dynasty has been more integrated into the Chassidic community with many of their customs derived from Nusach Sefard, but still remains true to the teachings of the Chasam Sofer. This is mainly due to rabbi Yosef Tzvi's appointment as Chief Rabbi of the Edah HaChareidis and the Dushinsky alignment with the teachings of rabbi Joel Teitelbaum of Satmar.

His three-volume history of American letters, Main Currents in American Thought, won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1928 and was one of the most influential books for American historians of its time. Career Born in Aurora, Illinois, to a Republican family that soon moved to Emporia, Kansas, Parrington attended the College of Emporia and Harvard University, receiving his B.A. from the latter institution in 1893. He did not undertake graduate study. He was appalled by the hardships of Kansas farmers in the 1890s, and began moving left. After teaching English at the College of Emporia, he moved to the University of Oklahoma in 1897, where he taught British literature, organized the department of English, coached the football team, played on the baseball team, edited the campus newspaper, and tried to beautify the campus. He published little and in 1908 he was fired due to pressures from religious groups who wanted all \\"immoral faculty\\" fired. From there he went on to a distinguished academic career at the University of Washington.Hall 1994 Intellectual on the left Parrington moved to the much friendlier University of Washington in Seattle, Washington in 1908. He recalled in 1918, \\"With every passing year my radicalism draws fresh nourishment from large knowledge of the evils of private capitalism. Hatred of that selfish system is become the chief passion of my life. The change from Oklahoma to Washington marks the shift with me from the older cultural interpretation of life to the later economic.\\"quoted in Levy (1995) p 666 Founder of American Studies Parrington founded the interdisciplinary American Studies movement with his 1927 work Main Currents in American Thought. The movement was expanded in the 1920s and 1930s by Perry Miller, F. O. Matthiessen, and Robert Spiller. The elements that these pioneers considered revolutionary were interdisciplinarity, a holistic culture concept, and a focus on the uniqueness of American culture.Verheul (1999) From the introduction to Main Currents of American Thought: \\"I have undertaken to give some account of the genesis and development in American letters of certain germinal ideas that have come to be reckoned traditionally American‚Äîhow they came into being here, how they were opposed, and what influence they have exerted in determining the form and scope of our characteristic ideals and institutions. In pursuing such a task, I have chosen to follow the broad path of our political, economic, and social development, rather than the narrower belletristic.\\" Main Currents in American Thought Parrington is best remembered as the author of Main Currents in American Thought (1927), a politics-centered 3-volume history of American letters from colonial times that won the 1928 Pulitzer Prize for History, which postulates a sharp divide between the elitist Hamiltonian current and its populist Jeffersonian opponents, making clear his identification with the latter. Parrington defined the three phases of U.S. history as Calvinistic pessimism, romantic optimism, and mechanistic pessimism, with democratic idealism as the main driving force. Parrington defended the doctrine of state sovereignty, and sought to disassociate it from the cause of slavery, claiming that the association of those two causes had proven \\"disastrous to American democracy,\\" removing the last brake on the growth of corporate power in the Gilded Age as the federal government began shielding capitalists from local and state regulation. For two decades Main Currents in American Thought was one of the most influential books for American historians. Reising (1989) shows the book dominated literary and cultural criticism from 1927 through the early 1950s. Crowe (1977) calls it \\"the \\"Summa Theologica of Progressive history.\\" Progressive history was a set of related assumptions and attitudes, which inspired the first great flowering of professional American scholarship in history. These historians saw economic and geographical forces as primary, and saw ideas as merely instruments. They regarded many dominant concepts and interpretations as masks for deeper realities. Reinitz (1977) stresses Parrington's heavy use of historical irony, which occurs when the consequences of an action emerge contrary to the original intentions of the actors. Parrington represented the Progressive School of historians which stressed the duality of good versus evil in the American past. Yet, in his final volume of Main Currents he concluded that the Jeffersonian farmer, the Progressives' traditional democratic hero, had joined forces with the greedy business community to produce a destructive form of capitalism which culminated in the 1920s. His progressive interpretation of American history was highly influential in the 1920s and 1930s and helped define modern liberalism in the United States. After receiving overwhelming praise and exerting enormous influence among intellectuals in the 1930s and 1940s, Parrington's ideas fell out of fashion before 1950. Richard Hofstadter says \\"the most striking thing about the reputation of V L Parrington, as we think of it today, is its abrupt decline....during the 1940s Parrington rather quickly cease to have a compelling interest for students of American literature, and in time historians too began to desert him.\\"Hofstadter, Progressive Historians pp 349, 352 Hofstadter shows how Parrington's ideas came under heavy assault in the 1940s and 1950s, naming Lionel Trilling as especially influential in the attack. Harold Bloom says: \\"Parrington was, in turn, condemned to obscurity by critics like Lionel Trilling, who sharply criticized his literary nationalism and his insistence that literature should appeal to a popular constituency.\\" Liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., in his autobiography, says that the progressive histories of the 1920s such as Main Currents, \\"are little read and their authors largely forgotten.\\" He adds that, \\"Main Currents impoverished the rich and complex American past. Parrington reduced Jonathan Edwards, Poe, Hawthorne, Melville, Henry James to marginal figures, practitioners of belles lettres, not illuminators of the American experience.\\" Coaching career Parrington was the second head coach of the University of Oklahoma football team, where he was the first OU faculty member to officially hold the position. He is credited with bringing a Harvard style of play and better organization to the OU football program. During his four-year stretch from 1897 to 1900 Parrington's teams played only twelve games, with 9 wins, 2 losses and 1 tie. Parrington's span as head football coach was the longest of any of Oklahoma's first 5 coaches. The Parrington Oval at the University of Oklahoma and Parrington Hall at the University of Washington are named for Vernon Louis Parrington. Head coaching record Legacy Hall finds that in the 1940s and 1950s English professors dropped Parrington's approach in favor of the \\"New Criticism\\" and focused on the texts themselves rather than the social, economic, and political contexts that intrigued Parrington. Meanwhile, historians shifted to a consensus model of the past that considered Parrington's dialectical polarity between liberal and conservative to be naive. During the 1950s the book lost its popularity, and was largely ignored by scholars. While dismissing its thesis, some commentators were still captivated by Parrington's politically committed writing style, as historian David W. Levy noted: :Readers and scholars of the rising generation may not follow Parrington's particular judgments or point of view, but it is hard to believe that they will not still be attracted, captivated, and inspired by his sparkle, his breadth, his daring, the ardor of his political commitment.David W.

The gathering is attended by his son, Gregers Werle, who has just returned to his father's home following a self-imposed exile. There, he learns the fate of a former classmate, Hjalmar Ekdal. Hjalmar married Gina, a young servant in the Werle household. The older Werle had arranged the match by providing Hjalmar with a home and profession as a photographer. Gregers, whose mother died believing that Gina and H√•kon had carried on an affair, becomes enraged at the thought that his old friend is living a life built on a lie. The remaining four acts take place in Hjalmar Ekdal's apartments. The Ekdals initially appear to be living a life of cozy domesticity. Hjalmar's father makes a living doing odd copying jobs for Werle. Hjalmar runs a portrait studio out of the apartment. Gina helps him run the business in addition to keeping house. They both dote on their daughter Hedvig. Gregers travels directly to their home from the party. While getting acquainted with the family, Hjalmar confesses that Hedvig is both his greatest joy and greatest sorrow, because she is slowly losing her eyesight. The family eagerly reveals a loft in the apartment where they keep various animals like rabbits and pigeons. Most prized is the wild duck they rescued. The duck was wounded by none other than Werle, whose eyesight is also failing. His shot winged the duck, which dived to the bottom of the lake to drown itself by clinging to the seaweed. Werle's dog retrieved it though, and despite its wounds from the shot and the dog's teeth, the Ekdals had nursed the duck back to good health. Gregers decides to rent the spare room in the apartment. The next day, he begins to realize that there are more lies hanging over the Ekdals than Gina's affair with his father. While talking to Hedvig, she explains that Hjalmar keeps her from school because of her eyesight, but he has no time to tutor her, leaving the girl to escape into imaginary worlds through pictures she sees in books. During their conversation, Gregers hears shots in the attic, and the family explains that Old Ekdal entertains himself by hunting rabbits and birds in the loft, and Hjalmar often joins in the hunts. The activity helps Old Ekdal cling to his former life as a great hunter. Hjalmar also speaks of his 'great invention', which he never specifies. It is related to photography, and he is certain that it will enable him to pay off his debts to Werle and finally make himself and his family completely independent. In order to work on his invention, he often needs to lie down on the couch and think about it. During a lunch with Gregers and Hjalmar's friends Relling and Molvik, H√•kon arrives to try to convince Gregers to return home. Gregers insists that he cannot return and that he will tell Hjalmar the truth. H√•kon is certain that Hjalmar will not be grateful for Gregers' intervention. After he leaves, Gregers asks Hjalmar to accompany him on a walk, where he reveals the truth about Gina's affair with his father. Upon returning home, Hjalmar is aloof from his wife and daughter. He demands to handle all future photography business by himself with no help from Gina. He also demands to manage the family's finances, which Gina has traditionally done. Gina begs him to reconsider, suggesting that with all his time consumed he will not be able to work on his invention. Hedvig adds that he also will not have time to spend in the loft with the wild duck. Embittered by Gregers' news, Hjalmar bristles at the suggestion and confesses that he would like to wring the duck's neck. Indulging his mood, Hjalmar confronts Gina about her affair with H√•kon. She confesses to it, but insists that she loves Hjalmar intensely. In the midst of the argument, Gregers returns, stunned to find that the couple are not overjoyed to be living without such a lie hanging over their heads. Mrs. S√∏rby arrives with a letter for Hedvig and news that she is marrying H√•kon. The letter announces that H√•kon is paying Old Ekdal a pension of 100 crowns per month until his death. Upon his death, the allowance will be transferred to Hedvig for the remainder of her life. The news sickens Hjalmar even further, and it dawns on him that Hedvig may very well be H√•kon's child. He cannot stand the sight of Hedvig any longer and leaves the house to drink with Molvik and Relling. Gregers tries to calm the distraught Hedvig by suggesting that she sacrifice the wild duck for her father's happiness. Hedvig is desperate to win her father's love back and agrees to have her grandfather shoot the duck in the morning. The next day, Relling arrives to tell the family that Hjalmar has stayed with him. He is appalled at what Gregers has done, and he reveals that he long ago implanted the idea of the invention with Hjalmar as a \\"life- lie\\" to keep him from giving in to despair. The pair argue as Hjalmar returns to gather his materials to work on the invention. He is overwhelmed by the number of details involved in moving out of the apartment. Hedvig is overjoyed to see him, but Hjalmar demands to be 'free from intruders' while he thinks about his next move. Crushed, Hedvig remembers the wild duck and goes to the loft with a pistol. After hearing a shot, the family assumes Old Ekdal is hunting in the loft, but Gregers knows he has shot the wild duck for Hedvig. He explains the sacrifice to Hjalmar who is deeply touched. When Old Ekdal emerges from his room, the family realizes he could not have fired the gun in the loft. They rush in to see Hedvig lying on the ground. No one can find a wound, and Relling has to examine the girl. He finds that the shot has penetrated her breastbone and she died immediately. Given the powder burns on her shirt, he determines that she shot herself. Hjalmar begs for her to live again so that she can see how much he loves her. The play ends with Relling and Gregers arguing again. Gregers insists that Hedvig did not die in vain, because her suicide unleashed a greatness within Hjalmar. Relling sneers at the notion, and insists that Hjalmar will be a drunk within a year. Analysis and criticism Guided by a fervent strain of idealism, Gregers endeavors to reveal the truth to Hjalmar, and thereby free him from the mendacity which surrounds him. To that end, Gregers takes up residence in the Ekdal home. He meddles in the affairs of a strange family, producing disastrous results. Figuratively speaking, he lives in a house whose closets are full of skeletons. Over the course of the play the many secrets that lie behind the Ekdals' apparently happy home are revealed to Gregers, who insists on pursuing the absolute truth, or the \\"Summons of the Ideal\\". This family has achieved a tolerable modus vivendi by ignoring the skeletons (among the secrets: Gregers' father may have impregnated his servant Gina then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child, and Hjalmar's father has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle committed.) and by permitting each member to live in a dreamworld of his own‚Äîthe feckless father believing himself to be a great inventor, the grandfather dwelling on the past when he was a mighty sportsman, and little Hedvig, the child, centering her emotional life on an attic where a wounded wild duck leads a crippled existence in a make-believe forest. To the idealist all this appears intolerable. To him as to other admirers of Ibsen it must seem that the whole family is leading a life \\"based on a lie\\"; all sorts of evils are \\"growing in the dark\\".Krutch, Joseph Wood. \\"Modernism\\" in Modern Drama: A Definition and an Estimate. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1953. Page 15. The remedy is obviously to face facts, to speak frankly, to let in the light. However, in this play the revelation of the truth is not a happy event because it rips up the foundation of the Ekdal family. When the skeletons are brought out of the closet, the whole dreamworld collapses; the weak husband thinks it is his duty to leave his wife, and the little girl, after trying to sacrifice her precious duck, shoots herself with the same gun (overhearing the fatal words from Hjalmar: \\"Would she lay down her life for me?\\"). One of the famous quotes from the doctor Relling who built up and maintained the lies the family is founded on is \\"Deprive the average human being of his life-lie, and you rob him of his happiness.\\" \\" Different translations use different words for the \\"life-lie\\". In Eva le Gallienne's translation, Relling says \\"I try to discover the Basic Lie ‚Äì the pet illusion ‚Äì that makes life possible; and then I foster it.\\" He also says \\"No, no; that's what I said: the Basic Lie that makes life possible.\\" On a symbolical level, Gregers and Relling seem to be opposites (the virtue of truth against the \\"basic lie\\"). The two seem to have confronted each other at several cross-roads, and the play ends with an exchange, almost a wager between the two over the possibilities of Hjalmar and his future. In this respect, Relling is a cynic who is not able to think Hjalmar will ever change, while Gregers still thinks there is hope for his eventual \\"redemption\\". Before the play starts, Gregers worked on a plant in the mountains, and is accused by Relling (present there as well), of \\"intriguing\\" with the local serfs (actually commoners). Thus, there is a social criticism in the play, where Gregers is trying to get in touch with common men, whilst his father is mingling with high society figures ‚Äì a setting in which his friend Hjalmar Ekdal is a stranger, and his father, disgraced by old Werle, is ignored by his son amongst his betters. From a social rather than a symbolic point of view, Gregers is trying to root out an unhealthy system, arguing that \\"truth shall set you free\\". In that respect, Relling, plotting with old Werle, is an advocate for the same system, and initially the opposite of Gregers (who, like Hamlet, is trying to get the truth out). One could argue that Gregers would feel responsible for the Ekdal family and their plight, as this is an apparent consequence of his father's manipulations and schemes. Early on, he mentions that his mother obviously died from neglect, or was driven into alcoholism by her husband's actions. As old Werle points out: \\"you see me with the eyes of your mother\\". In this respect, the Ekdal family are helpless victims, and so is Hedvig. Background As in many of Ibsen's plays, characters are based on or named after his family members to a greater or lesser extent. The character Old Ekdal is regarded by most Ibsen scholars as one of Ibsen's most important literary portraits of his father Knud Ibsen. Ibsen had previously portrayed his father as the characters \\"Jon Gynt\\" and \\"Daniel Hejre\\", where the son's judgment of his father's wastefulness was both harsh and bitter. In old Ekdal's character, however, the poet looks at his father, \\"the forlorn Knud Ibsen, in a conciliatory and compassionate way\\".Oskar Mosfjeld: \\"Vildanden\\". In Henrik Ibsen: Norske og utenlandske foredrag under minneuken 1956. Edda: Nordisk tidsskrift for litteraturforskning, vol. 56, p. 139, 1956 According to Ibsen scholar Jon Nygaard, the character Gregers Werle represents the spirit of the Paus family and Upper Telemark, a broader theme that is found in many of Ibsen's plays; Nygaard points out that H√∏ydalsverket, where Werle lived for years, is an obvious reference to Upper Telemark and especially H√∏ydalsmo (Ibsen's ancestor Paul Paus owned H√∏ydalsmo Stave Church). The character Hedvig is named after the Paus family, where the Hedvig name had been passed on for generations, and more specifically after Ibsen's grandmother Hed(e)vig Paus and sister Hedvig Ibsen. Ibsen's model for Hedvig, especially her outward appearance, was a 13-year-old Italian-resident German girl he met in Gossensa√ü in the summer of 1884, Martha Kopf (born 1870), daughter of the sculptor Joseph von Kopf, who lived in Rome.Martha Kopf, Henrik Ibsens skrifter Ibsen wrote in a letter to his son Sigurd Ibsen: \\"The German sculptor, Professor Kopf from Rome, has with him a 13-year-old daughter, who is the most excellent model for Hedvig that I could wish for; she is beautiful, has a serious face and personality, and is a little greedy.\\"Else H√∏st (1967): Vildanden av Henrik Ibsen, Aschehoug, p. 271Henrik Ibsen (27 August 1884): Letter to Sigurd Ibsen, Henrik Ibsens skrifter There is a bust of Martha Kopf by her later husband Hugo Berwald. Robert Ferguson notes that The Wild Duck did not come easily to Ibsen. During the writing process, Norway was characterized by political turmoil, and from his voluntary exile in Rome, Ibsen was concerned that \\"the strength of an intimate, personal play such as The Wild Duck might drown in the political debate over the introduction of parliamentarism in Norway\\". After a visit to Rome in the spring of 1884 from a young relative, (later Count) Christopher Paus, from whom he was eager to hear news regarding the family in Skien, Ibsen declared that he \\"writes with full force.\\"Ferguson, Robert (2006): Henrik Ibsen: mellom evne og higen, Cappelen, , p. 312 In the summer of 1884 he completed the play in Gossensa√ü.

The film's music was composed by George Fenton. For his performance Cleese won the 1987 Peter Sellers Award For Comedy at the Evening Standard British Film Awards. Most urban scenes were shot in the West Midlands, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, while rural scenes were largely shot in Shropshire.Clockwise Locations' at Gloucestershire On Screen Plot Brian Stimpson (Cleese), headmaster of Thomas Tompion Comprehensive School, has been elected to chair the annual Headmasters' Conference meeting at the fictional University of Norwich. Extremely disorganised as a young man, Stimpson is now obsessively organised and punctual, and his school runs \\"like clockwork\\". He is the first headmaster of a comprehensive school to chair the Headmasters' Conference, that honour usually being reserved for heads of the more elite public schools. Despite repetitive rehearsal of his speech and preparations for the journey to the conference, Stimpson's ordered world unwinds as a series of misadventures plague him en route. He mistakenly boards the wrong train, missing his connection for Norwich, owing to a lingering habit of saying \\"right\\" as emphasis in situations where it would be mistaken for a direction; then, in his desperation to board the departing correct train, he leaves the text of his speech behind on the wrong one, and is finally left at the railway station by his wife, who thinks he departed on the train. Frantic to get to Norwich on time, Stimpson searches for his wife at home and then at the hospital where she volunteers looking after dementia patients, but narrowly misses her. Attempting to hail a taxi, Stimpson stumbles across Laura, one of his sixth form students (grades 11-12 in some countries, ages 16-18) who is driving truant during a study break; he commandeers her and her car in a bid to drive to Norwich. Stimpson's wife sees the duo at a petrol station and assumes the worst, suspecting that her husband is carrying on with the student and taking her down to attend the conference. Mrs. Stimpson (who is still looking after three senile old women) drives after Stimpson and both parties forget to pay for their petrol. The police are called and, responding to a call from Laura's parents (reporting the car as stolen and their daughter as missing) as well, attempt to find Stimpson and arrest him for kidnapping. Stimpson's wife, Laura's parents, the police and Mr. Jolly, a music teacher at Thomas Tompion who has secretly been dating Laura, all pursue Stimpson and Laura to the conference. En route, Stimpson and Laura try to call the conference from a telephone box. A local mistakes them for vandals after Stimpson vents his rage at the malfunctioning phones, and calls the police. The local sends her daughter Pat to Stimpson, but she turns out to be a childhood friend and former girlfriend of Stimpson. Stimpson coerces her into driving them to the conference. After a series of wrong turns, the group desperately turn into a farm field in order to escape cows and a lorry, and shortly after get stuck in deep mud. Brian leaves the stuck car to seek help, and ends up at a monastery where he is persuaded to take a bath and collect himself. While he's gone, a local farmer tugs the car out of the mud; Pat finally drives away in the car but is soon arrested for assaulting a police officer. All the while, Stimpson's wife and the others arrive at the conference uninvited, much to the annoyance of the headmasters; they attempt to sequester the growing group of concerned parents, wives, senile ladies and police officers as the conference continues. Stranded without transport, Laura and Stimpson (who is dressed in monks' robes, leaving his muddy suit with the monks) attempt to hitchhike. They are picked up by a wealthy car salesman, whom they persuade to come for a walk in the woods. They trick the traveller into swapping clothes with Stimpson under the ruse of naughty fun, but Stimpson and Laura run away and steal his car. Stimpson finally arrives at the conference in the torn suit of the car salesman and delivers an improvised recount of his lost speech, which becomes increasingly strident and imperious in tone to the shocked headmasters. During his speech various characters including the old women, Mr. Jolly and Laura's parents walk into the hall, and Stimpson addresses them like he would late pupils, commanding and shaming the entire collected group with the same strict demeanour with which he runs his own school. Finally, he directs all of the headmasters to stand and sing the hymn \\"To Be a Pilgrim\\", as he walks out of the building to face the police. The headmasters rush like excited children to watch as Stimpson, his wife, Laura and her parents, Mr. Jolly and the senile old women are all lead away by policemen, with Stimpson still giving headmasterly orders to all the officers in the car.

Frayn wrote it on \\"spec\\". He said, \\"I had always wanted to write something about a man who is late because I have considerable problems in relation to that myself, and only get places early by enormous expenditure of psychic energy.\\" He showed it to theatrical producer Michael Codron, who had produced five Frayn works on stage including the hugely successful Benefactors and Noises Off, and asked if Codron would like to produce it. \\"I said, 'Why not?'\\" said the producer. \\"I've always been interested in movies.\\"Three of the best: David Newpart on three big theatrical names going into films Newport, David. The Guardian 1 Aug 1985: 11. Codron showed the script to Nat Cohen at EMI Films who gave it to the company's head of production Verity Lambert and she agreed to finance. The title was originally Man of the Moment but this was changed when it was realised that had been used for a Norman Wisdom film. John Cleese was signed to star. \\"No one will believe it but I didn't have an idea for casting,\\" said Frayn. Cleese later said the script was \\"the best I've ever seen. The same day it landed on my front door, I rang my agent and said, 'I have to do this.' \\"JOHN CLEESE WANTS OUT OF THE ART HOUSES Honeycutt, Kirk; Los Angeles. Philadelphia Daily News1 Nov 1986: 21. \\"Stimpson is a victim of circumstance,\\" Cleese said. \\"As the pressures increase, his behavior becomes more and more erratic. Comedy is about things always going wrong, and that's just what happens to him. When you first see him, he's in charge. But as events take over and he can't cope-that's when he falls apart.\\" ENTER STIMPSON Hall, William. Los Angeles Times 23 Feb 1986: 21. Codron, Cleese and Lambert had a meeting to decide the director. They selected Chris Morahan, who had directed Frayn's Chekov adaptation Wild Honey on stage and had recently directed Jewel in the Crown for TV. Filming took eight weeks in June and July 1985 in Hull, Shropshire and Birmingham. Reception The film was popular in Britain but only played art houses in the US. This prompted Cleese to make A Fish Called Wanda to be accessible to American audiences, to \\"get out of the art houses\\" there. Cleese later recalled a scene, \\"there was a scene where I had to make a call from a public phone booth. None of the phones worked and I had to go from booth to booth with increasing fury before I found one that did. In England, that scene got a big laugh because no one here expects the phones to work. But it played to total silence in America, where they all expect to get through on a phone the first time.\\"PYTHON'S CLEESE STARS AS A SALESMAN FOR \`WANDA'Lewin, David.

It was the first system able to send mail between users on different hosts connected to ARPANET. Previously, mail could be sent only to others who used the same computer. To achieve this, he used the @ sign to separate the user name from the name of their machine, a scheme which has been used in email addresses ever since. The Internet Hall of Fame in its account of his work commented \\"Tomlinson's email program brought about a complete revolution, fundamentally changing the way people communicate\\". Early life and education Tomlinson was born in Amsterdam, New York, but his family soon moved to the small, unincorporated village of Vail Mills, Broadalbin, New York. He attended Broadalbin Central School in nearby Broadalbin, New York. Later he attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York where he participated in the co-op program with IBM. He received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from RPI in 1963. After graduating from RPI, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to continue his electrical engineering education. At MIT, Tomlinson worked in the Speech Communication Group and developed an analog- digital hybrid speech synthesizer as the subject of his thesis for the master's degree in electrical engineering, which he received in 1965. Career In 1967, he joined the technology company of Bolt, Beranek and Newman (now BBN Technologies), where he helped develop the TENEX operating system including the ARPANET Network Control Program, implementations of Telnet, and implementations on the self-replicating programs Creeper and Reaper. He wrote a file transfer program called CPYNET to transfer files through the ARPANET. Tomlinson was asked to change a program called SNDMSG, which sent messages to other users of a time-sharing computer, to run on TENEX. He added code he took from CPYNET to SNDMSG so messages could be sent to users on other computers‚Äîthe first email. The first email Tomlinson sent was a test. It was not preserved and Tomlinson describes it as insignificant, something like \\"QWERTYUIOP\\". This is commonly misquoted as \\"The first e-mail was QWERTYUIOP\\". Tomlinson later commented that these \\"test messages were entirely forgettable and I have, therefore, forgotten them.\\" At first, his email messaging system was not considered important. Its development was not a directive of his employer, with Tomlinson merely pursuing it \\"because it seemed like a neat idea\\". When showing the system to a colleague, Tomlinson said \\"Don't tell anyone! This isn't what we're supposed to be working on\\". Tomlinson said he preferred \\"email\\" over \\"e-mail\\", joking in a 2010 interview that \\"I'm simply trying to conserve the world's supply of hyphens\\" and that \\"the term has been in use long enough to drop the hyphen\\". Death Tomlinson died at his home in Lincoln, Massachusetts, on March 5, 2016, from a heart attack. He was 74 years old. Awards and honors * In 2000 he received the George R. Stibitz Computer Pioneer Award from the American Computer Museum (with the Computer Science Department of Montana State University). * In 2001 he received a Webby Award from the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences for lifetime achievement. Also in 2001 he was inducted into the Rensselaer Alumni Hall of Fame. * In 2002 Discover magazine awarded him its Innovative Innovating Award of Innovation. * In 2004, he received the IEEE Internet Award along with Dave Crocker. * In 2009, he along with Martin Cooper was awarded the Prince of Asturias award for scientific and technical research. * In 2011, he was listed 4th in the MIT150 list of the top 150 innovators and ideas from MIT. * In 2012, Tomlinson was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.

Door handles may also use the same installation. Installation Typical preparation required for installation of a bored cylindrical lockset. Two holes are bored, perpendicular to one another, into the door. The \\"face bore\\" is the larger hole which is bored into the door face and a smaller \\"edge bore\\" hole is bored into the door edge. The edge may require additional preparation to receive the latch assembly, typically by routing or chiseling a shallow mortise. Some commercially-sold doors may come prepared to receive one or more bored cylindrical locks, such as entry doors, which typically require both a door knob and dead bolt. Friday, 12 April 2019 In the United States, typically, the face bore is sized from in diameter and is centered at from the leading edge of the door. This distance is referred to as the \\"backset.\\" Other, less popular, backsets are at . Residential doors are normally prepared with a backset and commercial doors have a backset. The edge bore is typically centered on the edge. History The cylindrical lock was invented by Walter Schlage in 1923. The bored cylindrical lock arose from a need for a more cost-effective method of locking doors. The previous norm (still the norm in Europe), the mortise lock, is a more complex device, and its higher manufacturing cost as well as its more labor-intensive installation make the bored cylindrical lock an ideal substitute, both in price and functionality. Because the mortise lock has a larger lock case, a larger and more complex volume must be removed from the door before it can be installed, but the mortise lock may offer additional functions compared to a cylindrical lock; for instance, the mortise lock may include a deadbolt in a single unit, while the cylindrical lock would require separate face bores for a deadbolt and doorknob. The 1923 patent evolved from an earlier Schlage patent filed in 1920 for a lock whose installation required a face bore and surface rabbet, which simplified door preparation compared to a mortise lock.

Early life and career  Yasmeen Ghauri was born in Montreal, Quebec to a German mother, Linda, and a Pakistani father, Moin Ghauri. Ghauri who was raised Muslim had a difficult childhood and was bullied by her classmates at school for her Pakistani heritage. Ghauri went with her parents for the Islamic Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca when she was 12. When she was 17, Ghauri was discovered while working at a McDonald's restaurant by Montreal hairdresser and artistic director of Platine Coiffure, Edward Zaccaria. Soon after her discovery, there was a shift in mentality within the fashion industry, moving from predominantly Nordic-looking models to more \\"ethnic\\" models, a trend which Ghauri helped to inspire. Despite her parents' disapproval, Ghauri actively pursued a modeling career, premiering in Milan and Paris before moving to New York in 1990. Here, she was noticed by fashion critics and labels alike. The New York Times described her runway walk as a \\"ball-bearing swivel of her hips\\". Her appearance prompted part of what is now termed in fashion the \\"Canadian invasion\\".  Achievements  One of her early appearances was in the music video for the Elton John song Sacrifice, along with Chris Isaak. Ghauri enjoyed fame in the early 1990s after her first major cover with Elle Magazine in January 1991. Soon after, she became the face of both Chanel and Jil Sander. By the end of 1990, Ghauri appeared on the cover of French Elle magazine in July and December. In September, she graced the catwalk for Gianni Versace's show in Milan and by the next month, she was walking for Chanel, Helmut Lang, Jean Paul Gaultier and Lanvin in Paris. She became the face of Christian Dior and Anne Klein in 1991. In January, she was photographed by Steven Meisel for the cover of Italian Vogue magazine and toward the end of the year, she appeared in British and Italian Vogue editorials. Photographer Patrick Demarchelier, who photographed her for the Italian issue, called her his favourite subject. In 1992, she landed a contract with Victoria's Secret and became a face of Valentino couture and Versace. According to an NYMag.com online model profile, Ghauri walked the controversial Gianni Versace \\"Bondage\\" show in Milan in February 1992. Ghauri became the face of Herm√®s and Lanvin in 1993 and was photographed by Gilles Bensimon for Elle. She appeared in the 1995 documentary Unzipped by Isaac Mizrahi, and walked the 1996 annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.  Retirement  When Ghauri stepped out of the Yves Saint Laurent show in 1996 at the last minute, speculations arose that she was retiring. She did indeed retire to start a family with her husband, lawyer Ralph Bernstein. They have a daughter named Maia.  References in other media  Ghauri was the inspiration for the character Jasmine in the comic book series Jonathan Steele.

He was also Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of New South Wales.Beyond the Banners: The Story of the Orange Order, pg, 95 Biography Born in Cork to Colman Mark Hammond a farmer and his second wife, Elizabeth (n√©e Sergeant). After his father died in 1883 he lived for some time with a Roman Catholic aunt. He was educated at Cork Model School and at age 13 he went to work as a railway clerk. He became a member of the Church of Ireland in 1892. He also joined the newly formed YMCA in Cork and studied with John McNay (his future brother in law) the YMCA librarian. At the age of 18 he entered the Irish Church Missions Training School in Dublin. Hammond was ordained as a deacon in the Church of Ireland in 1903 and priest in 1905. He was appointed curate of St. Kevin's Church, Camden Row, Dublin, and the Hammond family lived on nearby Synge Street. He received a BA in 1903 and subsequently an MA from Trinity College Dublin. Later in life he was awarded a ThD from the Australian College of Theology (ACT). He married Margaret McNay from Cork (of Scottish extraction but born in County Tipperary) in 1906, they had three sons; John Colman, Thomas Chatterton ('Chat'), Charles Kimble ('Carl') and a daughter, Doris.Thomas Chatterton(1877-1961) Web Journals. He was superintendent of the Irish Church Missions to the Roman Catholics from 1919 to 1936, where he engaged in evangelistic missions in Dublin and often in controversies with Roman Catholic apologists. A lively intellectual, his expertise in doctrinal difficulty was often sought by the bishops of the Church of Ireland, but not always publicly acknowledged. Hammond also helped draw up the constitution of the Anglican Church of Australia (at that time called the Church of England in Australia) and safe-guarded the independence of the Diocese of Sydney. He was also helpful in drawing up a constitution for the Church of England in South Africa, a denomination which was created separately from the largely Anglo- Catholicism dominated Church of the Province of South Africa. In 1936, Hammond left Ireland to take up position as Principal of Moore Theological College, Sydney. In addition, he was made the rector of St Philip's, York Street. He was made an archdeacon in 1949. His best-known books are In Understanding be Men (a handbook of Christian doctrine) and The One Hundred Texts, with Bible verses explaining Reformed teaching. Hammond was a controversial figure both in Ireland and Australia as a member of the Orange Order in Dublin and Sydney,FAQ's Dublin and Wicklow Loyal Orange Lodge 1313. eventually rising to the position of Grand Master of the Orange Institution of New South Wales in 1961. In recent times, his involvement in the establishment and running of the Bethany Home, a home for orphans, unmarried mothers and their children, and petty criminals, has also been raised for questioning, particularly due to the high mortality rate. The home is subject to ongoing calls to be added to the State redress scheme for victims of child, neglect, sexual and physical abuse. Hammond sat on the board of trustees of the Bethany Home from 1922 until 1935, as other members of the Church of Ireland clergy did throughout its existence. Hammond died on 16 November 1961.

It was introduced in 1985 by the American mathematician Peter L.

Given two integers and and modulus , the classical modular multiplication algorithm computes the double-width product , and then performs a division, subtracting multiples of to cancel out the unwanted high bits until the remainder is once again less than . Montgomery reduction instead adds multiples of to cancel out the low bits until the result is a multiple of a convenient (i.e. power of two) constant . Then the low bits are discarded, producing a result less than . One conditional final subtraction reduces this to less than . This procedure has a better computational complexity than standard division algorithms, since it avoids the quotient digit estimation and correction that they need. The result is the desired product divided by , which is less inconvenient than it might appear. To multiply and , they are first converted to Montgomery form or Montgomery representation and . When multiplied, these produce , and the following Montgomery reduction produces , the Montgomery form of the desired product. (A final second Montgomery reduction converts out of Montgomery form.) Converting to and from Montgomery form makes this slower than the conventional or Barrett reduction algorithms for a single multiply. However, when performing many multiplications in a row, as in modular exponentiation, intermediate results can be left in Montgomery form, and the initial and final conversions become a negligible fraction of the overall computation. Many important cryptosystems such as RSA and Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange are based on arithmetic operations modulo a large number, and for these cryptosystems, the computation by Montgomery multiplication is faster than the available alternatives.Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, and Scott A. Vanstone. Handbook of Applied Cryptography. CRC Press, 1996. , chapter 14.  Modular arithmetic and Montgomery form  Let denote a positive integer modulus. The quotient ring consists of residue classes modulo , that is, its elements are sets of the form :\\\\\\\\{ a + kN \\\\colon k \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\\\\\}, where ranges across the integers. Each residue class is a set of integers such that the difference of any two integers in the set is divisible by (and the residue class is maximal with respect to that property; integers aren't left out of the residue class unless they would violate the divisibility condition). The residue class corresponding to is denoted . Equality of residue classes is called congruence and is denoted :\\\\bar a \\\\equiv \\\\bar b \\\\pmod{N}. Storing an entire residue class on a computer is impossible because the residue class has infinitely many elements. Instead, residue classes are stored as representatives. Conventionally, these representatives are the integers for which . If is an integer, then the representative of is written . When writing congruences, it is common to identify an integer with the residue class it represents. With this convention, the above equality is written . Arithmetic on residue classes is done by first performing integer arithmetic on their representatives. The output of the integer operation determines a residue class, and the output of the modular operation is determined by computing the residue class's representative. For example, if , then the sum of the residue classes and is computed by finding the integer sum , then determining , the integer between 0 and 16 whose difference with 22 is a multiple of 17. In this case, that integer is 5, so . If and are integers in the range , then their sum is in the range and their difference is in the range , so determining the representative in requires at most one subtraction or addition (respectively) of . However, the product is in the range . Storing the intermediate integer product requires twice as many bits as either or , and efficiently determining the representative in requires division. Mathematically, the integer between 0 and that is congruent to can be expressed by applying the Euclidean division theorem: :ab = qN + r, where is the quotient \\\\lfloor ab / N \\\\rfloor and , the remainder, is in the interval . The remainder is . Determining can be done by computing , then subtracting from . For example, the product is determined by computing 7 \\\\cdot 15 = 105, dividing \\\\lfloor 105 / 17 \\\\rfloor = 6, and subtracting 105 - 6 \\\\cdot 17 = 105 - 102 = 3. Because the computation of requires division, it is undesirably expensive on most computer hardware. Montgomery form is a different way of expressing the elements of the ring in which modular products can be computed without expensive divisions. While divisions are still necessary, they can be done with respect to a different divisor . This divisor can be chosen to be a power of two, for which division can be replaced by shifting, or a whole number of machine words, for which division can be replaced by omitting words. These divisions are fast, so most of the cost of computing modular products using Montgomery form is the cost of computing ordinary products. The auxiliary modulus must be a positive integer such that . For computational purposes it is also necessary that division and reduction modulo R be inexpensive, and the modulus is not useful for modular multiplication unless . The Montgomery form of the residue class with respect to is , that is, it is the representative of the residue class . For example, suppose that and that . The Montgomery forms of 3, 5, 7, and 15 are , , , and . Addition and subtraction in Montgomery form are the same as ordinary modular addition and subtraction because of the distributive law: :aR + bR = (a + b)R, :aR - bR = (a - b)R. This is a consequence of the fact that, because , multiplication by is an isomorphism on the additive group . For example, , which in Montgomery form becomes . Multiplication in Montgomery form, however, is seemingly more complicated. The usual product of and does not represent the product of and because it has an extra factor of : :(aR \\\\bmod N)(bR \\\\bmod N) \\\\bmod N = (abR)R \\\\bmod N. Computing products in Montgomery form requires removing the extra factor of . While division by is cheap, the intermediate product is not divisible by because the modulo operation has destroyed that property. So for instance, the product of the Montgomery forms of 7 and 15 modulo 17 is the product of 3 and 4, which is 12. Since 12 is not divisible by 100, additional effort is required to remove the extra factor of . Removing the extra factor of can be done by multiplying by an integer such that RR' \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{N}, that is, by an R‚Ä≤ whose residue class is the modular inverse of mod . Then, working modulo , :(aR \\\\bmod N)(bR \\\\bmod N)R' \\\\equiv (aR)(bR)R^{-1} \\\\equiv (ab)R \\\\pmod{N}. The integer exists because of the assumption that and are coprime. It can be constructed using the extended Euclidean algorithm. The extended Euclidean algorithm efficiently determines integers and that satisfy B√©zout's identity: , , and: :RR' - NN' = 1. This shows that it is possible to do multiplication in Montgomery form. A straightforward algorithm to multiply numbers in Montgomery form is therefore to multiply , , and as integers and reduce modulo . For example, to multiply 7 and 15 modulo 17 in Montgomery form, again with , compute the product of 3 and 4 to get 12 as above. The extended Euclidean algorithm implies that , so . Multiply 12 by 8 to get 96 and reduce modulo 17 to get 11. This is the Montgomery form of 3, as expected.  The REDC algorithm  While the above algorithm is correct, it is slower than multiplication in the standard representation because of the need to multiply by R‚Ä≤ and divide by N. Montgomery reduction, also known as REDC, is an algorithm that simultaneously computes the product by R‚Ä≤ and reduces modulo N more quickly than the naive method. The speed is because all computations are done using only reduction and divisions with respect to R, not N: function REDC is input: Integers R and N with , Integer N‚Ä≤ in such that , Integer T in the range output: Integer S in the range such that m <- ((T mod R)N‚Ä≤) mod R t <- (T + mN) / R if t ‚â• N then return else return t end if end function To see that this algorithm is correct, first observe that m is chosen precisely so that is divisible by R. A number is divisible by R if and only if it is congruent to zero mod R, and we have: :T + mN \\\\equiv T + (((T \\\\bmod R)N') \\\\bmod R)N \\\\equiv T + T N' N \\\\equiv T - T \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{R}. Therefore, t is an integer. Second, the output is either t or , both of which are congruent to t mod N, so to prove that the output is congruent to , it suffices to prove that t is. Modulo N, t satisfies: :t \\\\equiv (T + mN)R^{-1} \\\\equiv TR^{-1} + (mR^{-1})N \\\\equiv TR^{-1} \\\\pmod{N}. Therefore, the output has the correct residue class. Third, m is in , and therefore is between 0 and . Hence t is less than , and because it's an integer, this puts t in the range . Therefore, reducing t into the desired range requires at most a single subtraction, so the algorithm's output lies in the correct range. To use REDC to compute the product of 7 and 15 modulo 17, first convert to Montgomery form and multiply as integers to get 12 as above. Then apply REDC with , , , and . The first step sets m to . The second step sets t to . Notice that is 1100, a multiple of 100 as expected. t is set to 11, which is less than 17, so the final result is 11, which agrees with the computation of the previous section. As another example, consider the product but with . Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, compute , so N‚Ä≤ will be . The Montgomery forms of 7 and 15 are and , respectively. Their product 28 is the input T to REDC, and since , the assumptions of REDC are satisfied. To run REDC, set m to . Then , so . Because , this is the Montgomery form of .  Arithmetic in Montgomery form  Many operations of interest modulo N can be expressed equally well in Montgomery form. Addition, subtraction, negation, comparison for equality, multiplication by an integer not in Montgomery form, and greatest common divisors with N may all be done with the standard algorithms. The Jacobi symbol can be calculated as \\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{N}\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{aR}{N}\\\\right) \\\\bigg/ \\\\left(\\\\frac{R}{N}\\\\right) as long as is stored. When , most other arithmetic operations can be expressed in terms of REDC. This assumption implies that the product of two representatives mod N is less than RN, the exact hypothesis necessary for REDC to generate correct output. In particular, the product of and is . The combined operation of multiplication and REDC is often called Montgomery multiplication. Conversion into Montgomery form is done by computing . Conversion out of Montgomery form is done by computing . The modular inverse of is . Modular exponentiation can be done using exponentiation by squaring by initializing the initial product to the Montgomery representation of 1, that is, to , and by replacing the multiply and square steps by Montgomery multiplies. Performing these operations requires knowing at least and . When R is a power of a small positive integer b, can be computed by Hensel's lemma: The inverse of N modulo b is computed by a naive algorithm (for instance, if then the inverse is 1), and Hensel's lemma is used repeatedly to find the inverse modulo higher and higher powers of b, stopping when the inverse modulo R is known; is the negation of this inverse. The constants and can be generated as and as . The fundamental operation is to compute REDC of a product. When standalone REDC is needed, it can be computed as REDC of a product with . The only place where a direct reduction modulo N is necessary is in the precomputation of .  Montgomery arithmetic on multiprecision (variable-radix) integers  Most cryptographic applications require numbers that are hundreds or even thousands of bits long. Such numbers are too large to be stored in a single machine word. Typically, the hardware performs multiplication mod some base B, so performing larger multiplications requires combining several small multiplications. The base B is typically 2 for microelectronic applications, 28 for 8-bit firmware, or 232 or 264 for software applications. The REDC algorithm requires products modulo R, and typically so that REDC can be used to compute products. However, when R is a power of B, there is a variant of REDC which requires products only of machine word sized integers. Suppose that positive multi-precision integers are stored little endian, that is, x is stored as an array such that for all i and . The algorithm begins with a multiprecision integer T and reduces it one word at a time. First an appropriate multiple of N is added to make T divisible by B. Then a multiple of N is added to make T divisible by B2, and so on. Eventually T is divisible by R, and after division by R the algorithm is in the same place as REDC was after the computation of t. function MultiPrecisionREDC is Input: Integer N with , stored as an array of p words, Integer , --thus, r = logB R Integer N‚Ä≤ in such that , Integer T in the range , stored as an array of words. Output: Integer S in such that , stored as an array of p words. Set (extra carry word) for do \\\\--loop1- Make T divisible by c <- 0 m <- for do \\\\--loop2- Add the low word of and the carry from earlier, and find the new carry x <- T[i + j] <- c <- end for for do \\\\--loop3- Continue carrying x <- T[i + j] <- c <- end for end for for do S[i] <- T[i + r] end for if then return else return end if end function The final comparison and subtraction is done by the standard algorithms. The above algorithm is correct for essentially the same reasons that REDC is correct. Each time through the i loop, m is chosen so that is divisible by B. Then mNBi is added to T. Because this quantity is zero mod N, adding it does not affect the value of . If mi denotes the value of m computed in the ith iteration of the loop, then the algorithm sets S to . Because MultiPrecisionREDC and REDC produce the same output, this sum is the same as the choice of m that the REDC algorithm would make. The last word of T, (and consequently ), is used only to hold a carry, and as the initial reduction result is bound to a result in the range of . It follows that this extra carry word can be avoided completely if it is known in advance that . On a typical binary implementation, this is equivalent to saying that this carry word can be avoided if the number of bits of N is smaller than the number of bits of R. Otherwise, the carry will be either zero or one. Depending upon the processor, it may be possible to store this word as a carry flag instead of a full-sized word. It is possible to combine multiprecision multiplication and REDC into a single algorithm. This combined algorithm is usually called Montgomery multiplication. Several different implementations are described by Ko√ß, Acar, and Kaliski. The algorithm may use as little as words of storage (plus a carry bit). As an example, let , , and . Suppose that and . The Montgomery representations of a and b are and . Compute . The initial input T to MultiPrecisionREDC will be [6, 4, 8, 5, 6, 7]. The number N will be represented as [7, 9, 9]. The extended Euclidean algorithm says that , so N‚Ä≤ will be 7. i <- 0 m <- j T c \\\\- ------- - 0 0485670 2 (After first iteration of first loop) 1 0485670 2 2 0485670 2 3 0487670 0 (After first iteration of second loop) 4 0487670 0 5 0487670 0 6 0487670 0 i <- 1 m <- j T c \\\\- ------- - 0 0087670 6 (After first iteration of first loop) 1 0067670 8 2 0067670 8 3 0067470 1 (After first iteration of second loop) 4 0067480 0 5 0067480 0 i <- 2 m <- j T c \\\\- ------- - 0 0007480 2 (After first iteration of first loop) 1 0007480 2 2 0007480 2 3 0007400 1 (After first iteration of second loop) 4 0007401 0 Therefore, before the final comparison and subtraction, . The final subtraction yields the number 50. Since the Montgomery representation of is , this is the expected result. When working in base 2, determining the correct m at each stage is particularly easy: If the current working bit is even, then m is zero and if it's odd, then m is one. Furthermore, because each step of MultiPrecisionREDC requires knowing only the lowest bit, Montgomery multiplication can be easily combined with a carry-save adder.  Side-channel attacks  Because Montgomery reduction avoids the correction steps required in conventional division when quotient digit estimates are inaccurate, it is mostly free of the conditional branches which are the primary targets of timing and power side-channel attacks; the sequence of instructions executed is independent of the input operand values. The only exception is the final conditional subtraction of the modulus, but it is easily modified (to always subtract something, either the modulus or zero) to make it resistant.Zhe Liu, Johann Gro√üsch√§dl, and Ilya Kizhvatov. \\"Efficient and Side-Channel Resistant RSA Implementation for 8-bit AVR Microcontrollers\\". p. 8. It is of course necessary to ensure that the exponentiation algorithm built around the multiplication primitive is also resistant.Marc Joye and Sung-Ming Yen. \\"The Montgomery Powering Ladder\\". 2002.

The addax (Addax nasomaculatus), also known as the white antelope and the screwhorn antelope, is an antelope of the genus Addax, that lives in the Sahara Desert. It was first described scientifically by Henri de Blainville in 1816. As suggested by its alternative name, this pale antelope has long, twisted horns - typically in females and in males. Males stand from at the shoulder, with females at . They are sexually dimorphic, as the females are smaller than the males. The colour of the coat depends on the season - in the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown hair on the head, neck, and shoulders; in the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde. The addax mainly eats grasses and leaves of any available shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes. These animals are well-adapted to exist in their desert habitat, as they can live without water for long periods of time. Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the addax is an easy target for its predators: humans, lions, leopards, cheetahs and African wild dogs. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts. The addax is a critically endangered species of antelope, as classified by the IUCN. Although extremely rare in its native habitat due to unregulated hunting, it is quite common in captivity. The addax was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and the Western Sahara. It has been reintroduced into Morocco and Tunisia. Taxonomy and naming The scientific name of the addax is Addax nasomaculatus. This antelope was first described by French zoologist and anatomist Henri Blainville in 1816. It is placed in the monotypic genus Addax and the family Bovidae. Henri Blainville observed syntypes in Bullock's Pantherion and the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. English naturalist Richard Lydekker stated their type locality to be probably Senegambia, though he did not have anything to support the claim. Finally, from a discussion in 1898, it became more probable that British hunters or collectors obtained the addax from the part of the Sahara in Tunisia. The generic name Addax is thought to be obtained from an Arabic word meaning a wild animal with crooked horns. It is also thought to have originated from a Latin word. The name was first used in 1693. The specific name nasomaculatus comes from the Latin words nasus (or the prefix naso-) meaning nose, and maculatus meaning spotted, referring to the spots and facial markings of the species. Bedouins use another name for the addax, the Arabic bakr (or bagr) al wahsh, which literally means \\"the cow of the wild\\". That name can be used to refer to other ungulates as well. The other common names of addax are \\"white antelope\\" and \\"screwhorn antelope\\". Genetics The addax has 29 pairs of chromosomes. All chromosomes are acrocentric except for the first pair of autosomes, which are submetacentric. The X chromosome is the largest of the acrocentric chromosomes, and the Y chromosome is medium-sized. The short and long arms of the pair of submetacentric autosomes correspond respectively to the 27th and 1st chromosomes in cattle and goats. In a study, the banding patterns of chromosomes in addax were found to be similar to those in four other species of the subfamily Hippotraginae. History and fossil record In ancient times, the addax occurred from northern Africa through Arabia and the Levant. Pictures in a tomb, dating back to 2500 BCE, show at least the partial domestication of the addax by the ancient Egyptians. These pictures show addax and some other antelopes tied with ropes to stakes. The number of addax captured by a person were considered an indicator of his high social and economic position in the society. The pygarg (\\"white-buttocked\\") beast mentioned in Deuteronomy 14:5 is believed to have been an addax. But today, excess poaching has resulted in the extinction of this species in Egypt since the 1960s. Addax fossils have been found in four sites of Egypt - a 7000 BCE fossil from the Great Sand Sea, a 5000‚Äì6000 BCE fossil from Djara, a 4000‚Äì7000 BCE fossil from Abu Ballas Stufenmland and a 5000 BCE fossil from Gilf Kebir. Apart from these, fossils have also been excavated from Mittleres Wadi Howar (6300 BCE fossil), and Pleistocene fossils from Grotte Neandertaliens, Jebel Irhoud and Parc d'Hydra. Physical description The addax is a spiral-horned antelope. Male addaxes stand from at the shoulder, with females at . They are sexually dimorphic, as the females are smaller than the males. The head and body length in both sexes is , with a long tail. The weight of males varies from , and that of females from . The coloring of the addax's coat varies with the season. In the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown hair on the head, neck, and shoulders. In the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde. Their head is marked with brown or black patches that form an 'X' over their noses. They have scraggly beards and prominent red nostrils. Long, black hairs stick out between their curved and spiralling horns, ending in a short mane on the neck. The horns, which are found on both males and females, have two to three twists and are typically in females and in males, although the maximum recorded length is . The lower and middle portions of the horns are marked with a series of 30 to 35 ring-shaped ridges. The tail is short and slender, ending in a puff of black hair. The hooves are broad with flat soles and strong dewclaws to help them walk on soft sand. All four feet possess scent glands. The life span of the addax is up to 19 years in the wild, which can be extended to 25 years under captivity. The addax closely resembles the scimitar oryx, but can be distinguished by its horns and facial markings. While the addax is spiral-horned, the scimitar oryx has decurved long horns. The addax has a brown hair tuft extending from the base of its horns to between its eyes. A white patch, continuing from the brown hair, extends until the middle of the cheek. On the other hand, the scimitar oryx has a white forehead with only a notable brown marking: a brown lateral stripe across its eyes. It differs from other antelopes by having large, square teeth like cattle and lacking the typical facial glands. = Addaxes in Souss-Massa National Park, Morocco = Addax (Addax nasomaculatus) adult male and juvenile.jpgAn adult male and juvenile Addax (Addax nasomaculatus) female.jpgA female Addax (Addax nasomaculatus) juvenile.jpgA juvenile Addax (Addax nasomaculatus) young adult head.jpgThe head of a young adult =Parasites= The addax is most prone to parasites in moist climatic conditions. Addaxes have always been infected with nematodes in the Trichostrongyloidea and Strongyloidea superfamilies. In an exotic ranch in Texas, an addax was found host to the nematodes Haemonchus contortus and Longistrongylus curvispiculum in its abomasum, of which the former was dominant. Behavior and ecology These animals are mainly nocturnal, particularly in summer. In the day, they dig into the sand in shady locations and rest in these depressions, which also protect them from sandstorms. Addax herds contain both males and females, and have from five to 20 members. They will generally stay in one place and only wander widely in search of food. The addax has a strong social structure, probably based on age, and herds are led by the oldest female. Herds are more likely to be found along the northern edge of the tropical rain system during the summer and move north as winter falls. They are able to track rainfall and will head for these areas where vegetation is more plentiful. Males are territorial and guard females, while the females establish their own dominance hierarchies. Due to its slow movements, the addax is an easy target for predators such as humans, lions, leopards, cheetahs and African wild dogs. Caracals, servals and hyenas attack calves. The addax is normally not aggressive, though individuals may charge if they are disturbed. =Adaptations= Addaxes grazing in dry conditions The addax is amply suited to live in the deep desert under extreme conditions. It can survive without free water almost indefinitely, because it gets moisture from its food and dew that condenses on plants. Scientists believe the addax has a special lining in its stomach that stores water in pouches to use in times of dehydration. It also produces highly concentrated urine to conserve water. The pale colour of the coat reflects radiant heat, and the length and density of the coat helps in thermoregulation. In the day the addax huddles together in shaded areas, and on cool nights rests in sand hollows. These practices help in dissipation of body heat and saving water by cooling the body through evaporation. In a study, eight addaxes on a diet of grass hay (Chloris gayana) were studied to determine the retention time of food from the digestive tract. It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including a high proportion of slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water- saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy rumen. =Diet= An addax calf with its mother The addax lives in desert terrain where it eats grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available. Primarily a grazer, its staple foods include Aristida, Panicum, and Stipagrostis, and it will only consume browse, such as leaves of Acacia trees in the absence of these grasses. It also eats perennials which turn green and sprout at the slightest bit of humidity or rain. The addax eats only certain parts of the plant and tends to crop the Aristida grasses neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while it eats the tender inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax's diet, being its main source of protein. =Reproduction= Females are sexually mature at 2 to 3 years of age and males at about 2 years. Breeding occurs throughout the year, but it peaks during winter and early spring. In the northern Sahara, breeding peaks at the end of winter and the beginning of spring; in the southern Sahara, breeding peaks from September to October and from January to mid-April. Each estrus bout lasts for one or two days. In a study, the blood serum of female addaxes was analyzed through immunoassay to know about their luteal phase. Estrous cycle duration was of about 33 days. During pregnancy, ultrasonography showed the uterine horns as coiled. The maximum diameters of the ovarian follicle and the corpus luteum were and . Each female underwent an anovulatory period lasting 39 to 131 days, during which there was no ovulation. Anovulation was rare in winter, which suggested the effect of seasons on the estrous cycle. Gestation period lasts 257‚Äì270 days (about nine months). Females may lie or stand during the delivery, during which one calf is born. A postpartum estrus occurs after two or three days. The calf weighs at birth and is weaned at 23‚Äì29 weeks old. Habitat and distribution The addax inhabits arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts. It even occurs in extremely arid areas, with less than 100 mm annual rainfall. It also inhabits deserts with tussock grasses (Stipagrostis species) and succulent thorn scrub Cornulaca. Formerly, the addax was widespread in the Sahelo-Saharan region of Africa, west of the Nile Valley and all countries sharing the Sahara Desert; but today the only known self-sustaining population is present in the Termit Massif Reserve (Niger). However, there are reports of sightings from the eastern Air Mountains (Niger) and Bod√©l√© (Chad). Rare nomads may be seen in northern Niger, southern Algeria and Libya; and the addax is rumoured to be present along the Mali/Mauritania border, though there have been no confirmed sightings. The addax was once abundant in North Africa, native to Chad, Mauritania and Niger. It is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Sudan and the Western Sahara. It has been reintroduced into Morocco and Tunisia. Threats and conservation An addax in a breeding program at the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, Israel Declines in the population of the addax have been ongoing since the mid-1800s. More recently, addaxes were found from Algeria to Sudan, but due mainly to overhunting, they have become much more restricted and rare. Addaxes are easy to hunt due to their slow movements. Roadkill, firearms for easy hunting and nomadic settlements near waterholes (their dry-season feeding places) have also decreased their numbers. Moreover, their meat and leather are highly prized. Other threats include chronic droughts in the deserts, habitat destruction due to more human settlements and agriculture. Fewer than 500 individuals are thought to exist in the wild today, most of the animals being found between the Termit area of Niger, the Bod√©l√© region of western Chad, and the Aoukar in Mauritania.Richard Trillo, The Rough Guide to West Africa Today there are over 600 addaxes in Europe, Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve (Israel), Sabratha (Libya), Giza Zoo (Egypt), North America, Japan and Australia under captive breeding programmes. There are thousands more in private collections and ranches in the United States and the Middle East. Addaxes are legally protected in Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria; hunting of all gazelles is forbidden in Libya and Egypt. Although enormous reserves, such as the Hoggar Mountains and Tasilli in Algeria, the T√©n√©r√© in Niger, the Ouadi Rim√©-Ouadi Achim Faunal Reserve in Chad, and the newly established Wadi Howar National Park in Sudan, cover areas where the addax previously occurred, some do not keep addaxes at the present time because they lack the resources. The addax has been reintroduced into Bou-Hedma National Park (Tunisia) and Souss- Massa National Park (Morocco). Reintroductions in the wild are ongoing in Jebil National Park (Tunisia) and Grand Erg Oriental (the Sahara), and another is planned for Morocco.

It was originally written by Greg Stafford and published by Chaosium, then was acquired by Green Knight Publishing, who in turn passed on the rights to White Wolf Publishing in 2004. White Wolf sold the game to Stewart Wieck in 2009. Wieck formed Nocturnal Media, who updated and reissued the 5th edition originally published by White Wolf. In 2018, it returned to Chaosium. After it was published in 1985, Pendragon won several industry awards, and reviewers highly recommended it; in following years, it was included in several \\"Best of\\" industry lists.  Setting  Like several other RPGs from Chaosium (most notably Call of Cthulhu), Pendragon has a literary basis, in this case the fifteenth-century Arthurian romance, Le Morte d'Arthur, and it studiously avoids fantasy RPG cliches in favor of its source material. This has caused it to become something of a cult game, even within the narrow confines of the RPG market. Adventures are often political, military, or spiritual in nature, rather than dungeon crawls, and are often presented as taking place congruently with events from Arthurian legend. An important part of the game is the time between adventures, during which player characters manage their estates, get married, age, and have children. Typically, the characters will have one adventure per year, and campaigns often carry over across generations, with players retiring their character and taking the role of that character's heir. This is quite different from most role-playing games, where one set of characters is played fairly intensively, and there is typically little consideration made of what happens to their family or descendants. The influence of this idea can be seen in the Ars Magica RPG, which also encourages stories taking years or decades to unfold (and which is also set in medieval Europe). The default Pendragon setting is a pastiche of actual fifth- and sixth-century British history, high medieval history (10th to 15th centuries), and Arthurian legend. The political forces are roughly those actually present in sub-Roman Britain: Celts fighting Germanic, Irish, and Pictish invaders in the wake of the collapse of Roman authority. Technology and many aspects of culture, however, progress in an accelerated fashion, such that King Arthur's Britain is depicted as thoroughly feudal. Knights bear unique coats of arms, joust in tournaments, follow chivalric customs, and pursue courtly love. In effect, many trappings of the milieu in which the Arthurian romances were composed are projected backwards. Many of the campaign events and personalities come from the great mass of Arthurian literature composed from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century. That being said, it is also possible to run a Pendragon campaign set firmly in the Dark Ages or in a more fantastic vision of Arthurian Britain.  System  The rules system of Pendragon is most notable for its system of personality traits and passions that both control and represent the character's behavior. Otherwise, it uses fairly traditional game mechanics for normal play, based to some degree on the Basic Role-Playing (BRP) system,. It also has a set of charts and tables for determining what happens to a character's family in between adventures. The characters' ability scores are based on BRP standard, but skills are resolved using d20, rather than d100. =Personal Traits= These are thirteen opposing values that represent a character's personality. The Traits are: Chaste / Lustful, Energetic / Lazy, Forgiving / Vengeful, Generous / Selfish, Honest / Deceitful, Just / Arbitrary, Merciful / Cruel, Modest / Proud, Pious / Worldly, Prudent / Reckless, Temperate / Indulgent, Trusting / Suspicious, and Valorous / Cowardly. The values on the left side are Virtues and the values on the right are Vices. The Traits are 1-20 points split between the opposing values (e.g., 10/10, 14/6, 5/15). For every point above 10 on a Virtue, a point must be placed below 10 on another Virtue. Characters start during character creation with a base of 15/5 in Valorous/Cowardly (because they are heroes), a base of 13/7 in their Religious Virtues (because they are the good guys) and a base score of 10/10 in the remaining values. A d20 roll is made to use a Virtue (e.g., Merciful to show mercy towards a captive mortal enemy) or resist a Vice (e.g., Deceitful to deceive a friend). If the roll is at or below the value, it Succeeds and the desired result occurs. If the roll exceeds the value, it is a Failure and the opposite result occurs. If a Virtue or Vice is rated at 20, the opposite is rated at 0; any roll on this trait is automatically successful (e.g., an Energetic character's attempt to persist in a difficult or arduous task) or automatically unsuccessful (e.g., an Indulgent character who must use Temperate to resist gluttony or intoxication). This is congruent with Arthurian legend, in which a hero's weaknesses are his downfall (like Lancelot's lust for Guenevere) or a villain has a moment of nobility (like King Uriens of Gore showing mercy to Prince Arthur rather than striking him down). The Chivalric Virtues are: Energetic, Generous, Forgiving, Just, Modest, Temperate, and Valorous. Characters possessing point values in these seven Virtues totaling above 80 are granted a bonus to Chivalry rolls. The Chivalric Vices are: Lazy, Selfish, Vengeful, Arbitrary, Cruel, Proud, and Cowardly. Characters possessing point values in these seven Vices totaling above 80 suffer a penalty to Chivalry rolls. The Christian Religious Virtues are: Chaste, Forgiving, Merciful, Modest, and Temperate. Christian Characters possessing one or more of these traits at a value of 16+ gain a Religious bonus. The Romantic Virtues are: Forgiving, Generous, Honest, Just, Merciful, and Trusting. Characters possessing point values in these six Virtues totaling above 65 are granted a bonus to Romance rolls. Later on, other cultures were added for players who wanted to play a non-Christian character. The Heathen Religious Virtues are Vengeful, Honest, Arbitrary, Proud, and Worldly. This covers Saracens and Picts. The Pagan Religious Virtues are Lustful, Energetic, Generous, Honest, and Proud. This covers British and Welsh pagans. The Wotanic Religious Virtues are Generous, Honest, Proud, Worldly, Reckless and Indulgent. This covers Germanic and Scandinavian pagans. =Passions= Passions are higher values that influence a character's behavior. They are generated by rolling 2d6+6 or 3d6 and adding or subtracting various modifiers. Passions roll on a d20, just like Traits. If a character fails a Passions roll, he goes into a state of Melancholy (hopeless depression) for violating his core belief. A critical failure or failed attempt to recover from Melancholy can lead to Madness, which forces the character to go into retirement until such time as he can redeem his actions or be forgiven by those he wronged. *Loyalty is a sense of duty to obey a liege, ally, or friend. *Love is a feeling of affection for another person (a parent, sibling, friend, or lover) or people (allies / followers, friends, or family members) that the character has strong emotional ties to. *Love (Family), an affection for family members, is common for daughters and firstborn sons. *Hospitality is the courtesy of providing shelter, lodging, and protection towards a guest. *Honor is a sense of duty towards following the rules of proper and noble behavior. Later editions added new Passions. *Amor is Romantic love for a person, replacing Love for a lover. *Hate is the obsessive dislike for a person, nation, or race. A character's Passion is often used to create dissonance and conflict. An example would be a Loyal knight faithfully obeying a cruel order from his unjust liege (or an Honorable knight refusing to do so, no matter the reason or excuse). Another would be an Hospitable host giving protection to a rude and discourteous guest (or an enemy who abuses the custom for insidious ends). =Magic and Magic-Users= Only the fourth edition of Pendragon included mechanics for magic and magician characters. All other versions of the game, including the later fifth edition, assumed that the character was a knight or lady and restricted magic to game master-controlled characters. =Character Generation= The first through fourth editions allowed random character generation of characters from a wide variety of cultures of Great Britain and western Europe, which was expanded by later supplements. The fifth edition supports only point-based creation of young landholding knights from the default homeland of Salisbury, which was a preferred option in the third and fourth editions as well. The supplement Book of Knights and Ladies, self-published by Greg Stafford in 2008, allows creation of more diverse characters for fifth edition. The regions of Logres, Cumbria, and Cambria profiled in the following three supplements were internal to Arthur's realm, and thus used standard character generation. * Savage Mountains (1991) - Cambria (Wales); Welsh characters. * Perilous Forest (1992) - Cumbria (Northern Britain); describes the lands of Cumbria (Northwest Britain) and Northumberland (Northeast Britain). * Blood and Lust (1995) - Logres (Southern Britain); loosely describes the lands of Lindsey, East Anglia, Middle Anglia, Mercia, and Wessex and the Saxon Shore of Essex, Sussex and Kent. Over its history the game spawned a number of supplements dealing with areas within or beyond Arthurian Britain and creating characters outside the culture of the Celtic Britons: * Pagan Shore (1994) - Ireland; Irish character generation, including Feudal Irish and two types of tribal peoples: the Cruithni (Irish Picts) and Lochlannach (somewhat ahistorical Norse raiders). * Beyond the Wall: Pictland & The North (1995) - Pictland (Caledonia, roughly modern Scotland); Pictish character generation. * Land of Giants (1996) - Scandinavia and the Nordic areas of Britain during the era of Beowulf; Northmen character generation. * Saxons! (1999) - The origins of Anglo-Saxon England (Southeast Britain); Jute (Jutland), Angle (Schleswig- Holstein), Frisian (Friesland), Saxon (Germany) & Frankish (France) character generation.  Publication history  The first edition was a boxed set published by Chaosium in 1985, and was designed and written by Greg Stafford. Chaosium planned a second edition, with minor changes to the rules, but this was never actually released. They released a third edition, with rules revised by Stafford, as a single softbound book in 1990. The fourth edition, published by Chaosium in 1993 and reprinted by Green Knight Publishing in 1999, was also released as a softbound manual: the core rules remained consistent with the third edition, but the book was expanded to include rules for player-character magicians and for advanced character-generation (the latter had originally appeared separately in the third-edition supplement Knights Adventurous). Green Knight Publishing also released a cut-down version of the fourth edition aimed at beginning players, The Book of Knights. Original designer Greg Stafford produced a much-streamlined fifth edition, which was published as a hardcover book by White Wolf in December, 2005. The most notable supplement for this edition is The Great Pendragon Campaign, a massive (432-page) hardcover scenario book which details events, adventures and characters from Uther Pendragon's reign in 485 through to the end of the Arthurian era. In Ownership passed from White Wolf to Nocturnal Media. In 2017 Nocturnal Media Kickstarted Paladin: Warriors of Charlemagne!.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nocturnalmedia/paladin- warriors-of-charlemagne/description Using the Pendragon rules system, it is set in medieval Europe with players playing young Frankish squires or knights in the service of Charlemagne. The Pendragon line returned to Chaosium in 2018. In 2020, a Quickstart preview for a sixth edition was published by Chaosium. Reception In the December 1985 issue of White Dwarf, Graham Staplehurst gave an effusive review, saying despite the very high price (¬£25.95) Pendragon \\"looks to be one of the best systemised role-playing games around.\\" Staplehurst liked the fact that the Arthurian background was generally known by players already, and lauded the research done in order to produce a timeline, and British folk beasts. He called the character generation system \\"adept.\\" Staplehurst gave an overall rating of 9 out of 10, saying, \\"I would not hesitate to recommend the game to any rolegaming aficianado... were it not for the dreadful price.\\" In the March 1986 edition of Dragon (Issue 107), Ken Rolston was effusive in his praise, calling it \\"in subject, mechanics, and presentation... the best designed, most attractive, and most effective traditional role-playing game I have ever seen. The process of playing the game, from the reading of the Player‚Äôs Book through the creation of a character to the playing of a simple introductory scenario, was one of the most satisfactory role-playing experiences of my life.\\" Rolston noted the simplified combat system, saying \\"Pendragon has attractively simple and streamlined versions of conventional RPG combat mechanics while offering innovative mechanics supporting role-playing and character development. (If you are interested in the wargaming aspect of fantasy role-playing, you may prefer another system with greater detail in combat mechanics and with player- character magic.)\\" He concluded by recommending it: \\"In presentation, Pendragon is attractive and pleasurable reading. The Pendragon boxed set is an excellent value, certainly one of the most important RPG releases of 1985, and belongs on every serious fantasy role-playing gamer‚Äôs shelf. In the February‚ÄìMarch 1987 edition of Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer (Issue No. 77), Steven List recommended it, saying, \\"It presents ample opportunity for both desperate combat and imaginative interactive play, with an orientation different from the typical fantasy campaign.\\" Andrew Rilstone reviewed Pendragon 4th Edition for Arcane magazine, rating it a 9 out of 10 overall. Rilstone comments that \\"Every rule and every bit of background meshes together to produce a game in which you can't help but think and act and even feel - like one of King Arthur's knights. Running a full campaign, and seeing the young squires from the first session growing up to be the veterans in the final battle, has been one of the best experiences in my roleplaying career. And, contrary to popular belief, you won't have to push the pram a lot.\\" In 1996, ten years after its publication, in a reader poll of the top 50 role- playing games of all time in Arcane magazine, Pendragon was ranked 12th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented, \\"Pendragon is a game with a huge amount of charm. It's extremely character orientated, and so players have the opportunity to spend time developing a separate persona, rather than having to deal with too much action. It has intrigue and complicated plots, but these are geared around the characters instead of merely being an excuse for the characters to do something.\\" In 1999, Pyramid magazine named Pendragon as one of The Millennium's Most Underrated Games. Editor Scott Haring said, \\"Pendragon is one of the few RPGs that has a moral point of view ... And it's a great melding of game system with game world.\\" In 2006, Gaming Report called the 5th edition of Pendragon one of the \\"Best Retreads\\" in 2006. In 2007, over twenty years after its publication, Pendragon was given a place in the book Hobby Games: The Top 100. Shannon Appelcline stated, \\"King Arthur Pendragon could be lauded as a top RPG solely based upon the innovation it brought to the industry. Its concentration on epic storytelling and its traits mechanic were both notable and original when the game was released in 1985. However, even today, Pendragon remains vital. It provides a picture-perfect model of literary knighthood and, through its well-crafted and well-considered design, effortlessly conjures its theme ‚Äî so successfully, in fact, that few other publishers in the last 20 years have even tried to bring another Arthurian roleplaying game to market. You just can't improve on perfection.

Naifeh (born June 16, 1939), usually known as Jimmy Naifeh, is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party from the State of Tennessee. He served as the Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1991 to 2009, serving longer in that position than anyone else in Tennessee history. Early life Naifeh is a second-generation Lebanese- American from Covington, a town north of Memphis. His family was in the grocery business and has hosted an annual Naifeh Family Coon Supper since 1945. Following his graduation from the University of Tennessee, Naifeh served in the United States Army as an infantry officer. Political career =Election to the House= He was first elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1974, and was Speaker from 1991 to 2009. He represents House District 81, which includes most of Tipton County and all of Haywood County. Prior to his election as Speaker served in other positions in the Democratic Caucus such as chairman of the Rules Committee, Majority Floor Leader, and chairman of the Rural West Tennessee Democratic Caucus. =Marriage= From 1995 to 2008, Naifeh was married to Betty Anderson, considered by many Tennessee political observers to be the most influential lobbyist in the state.The Tennessee Journal, vol. 35, no. 6, February 6, 2009 Naifeh's detractors saw this as a conflict of interest. Naifeh's reply was that she had no undue influence over him in any area of legislation and that she had been in that profession for many years before the personal relationship between them began, so it is hardly as if she entered the field once she married the Speaker as a way of offering access to him. =Partisan activities= Naifeh is considered a master of parliamentary procedure and tactics, which is very important in that the Speaker of the House in Tennessee generally personally presides over all sessions of the chamber. He is also regarded as being very partisan, particularly by his Republican opponents, who have long made him a \\"target\\" for defeat. In the most recent redistricting, much of the southern portion of Naifeh's native Tipton County was removed from his district. Many suggest that this was because Memphis suburbanites, who are generally quite conservative and reliable Republican voters with no long-term ties to Tipton County, would vote to replace Naifeh with a conservative Republican. However, he easily defeated retired Air Force colonel Tony Lopez in 2002. =Contested 2004 election= In December 2002, African American physician Dr. Jesse Cannon, a Republican and Naifeh's personal physician, announced that he would oppose Naifeh in 2004. Dr. Cannon counted heavily on support from outside the immediate region and was fairly successful raising campaign funds among affluent Republicans in the Nashville area. In an interesting dynamic to the race, the only other county in the district, added in the most recent redistricting, Haywood County, is Tennessee's only black- majority county. However, on November 2, 2004, Naifeh defeated Cannon by a margin of approximately 58% to 42%. =Challenges to speakership= The Democratic majority in the Tennessee House was narrowed to 53-46 by the overall statewide outcome of this election. Shortly after the election some pundits suggested scenarios in which another Democrat considered to be less partisan, such as Frank Buck of Dowelltown in Middle Tennessee, could have been elected Speaker if he could get the unanimous support of the Republican minority and the help of a few dissident Democrats from the eastern two-thirds of the state. From 1973 until January 2007, when state senator John S. Wilder was defeated in his reelection bid for the speakership of the state senate, both houses of the Tennessee General Assembly had been led by West Tennesseans. However, Republicans could not agree on a replacement, and when the issue came to a vote (Buck declined to be nominated), nine Republicans joined with all of the Democrats to reelect Naifeh. These Republican members were warned of the possibility, even the probability, of facing officially- party-endorsed opponents in the August 2006 primary election, should they choose to stand for another term. =Republican majority in 2008= In the 2008 November elections Republicans won the majority of the state House, winning 50 of the 99 seats, with the Democrats holding 49. This is the first time the GOP has had a majority in the Tennessee House since 1971, and the first time both House and Senate have had Republican majorities since Reconstruction. This ended Naifeh's long term as Speaker, but the Republicans' narrow majority in the House did not allow them to elect their preferred Speaker. While 49 Republicans voted for Jason Mumpower, the 49 Democrats and Republican Representative Kent Williams voted for Williams to succeed Naifeh as Speaker.Williams upsets House Speaker race, The Tennessean, January 13, 2009 Naifeh, who was chairing the House for the last time, helped to engineer Williams' election by instructing the House clerk to depart from the normal practice of conducting a roll call of the members in alphabetical order, instead calling first on the Democrats, then on the Republicans. This allowed Williams to vote last, so that before he voted he knew that his vote for himself would be the deciding vote.\\"Kent who? Dazzling maneuver makes backbencher speaker,\\" The Tennessee Journal Vol. 35, No. 3, January 16, 2009 =Retirement= On March 8, 2012; Naifeh announced he would not run for a 20th term in November. By the time of his retirement, he was the only elected Democrat above the county level in much of his district. While he had remained popular over the years, it had long been very likely that his seat would be taken by a Republican once he retired.

He played professionally for the New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, Texas Rangers, San Diego Padres and the Minnesota Twins. Bob Tewksbury has the lowest ratio of base on balls per innings pitched for any starting pitcher to pitch in the major leagues since the 1920s, and the lowest ratio for any pitcher to pitch since the 1800s except for Deacon Phillippe, Babe Adams, Dan Quisenberry, and Addie Joss. Early life Tewksbury was born in Concord, New Hampshire and attended Merrimack Valley High School in Penacook, New Hampshire. He played college baseball at Rutgers and Saint Leo University. In 1979 and 1980, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Playing career Tewksbury with the Nashville Sounds in 1984 Tewksbury's talent was initially discovered by Andy Michael in Concord. Michael contacted the New York Yankees and Tewksbury was drafted by them out of Saint Leo University in the 19th round of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft. He played for the Yankees for two years, and was then sent to the Chicago Cubs. As a free agent in 1988, he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals, where he would stay until 1994. Again a free agent, he went to the Texas Rangers for a year. In 1996, he signed with the San Diego Padres for one more year. In December 1996, he signed with the Minnesota Twins and played for two years with the team, but shoulder problems effectively ended his baseball career after that. Due to the shoulder and arm problems he faced over the course of his playing career, Tewksbury became known as an excellent control pitcher. His best year was 1992, in which he went 16-5 on the season and had a 2.16 ERA in 233 innings pitched. He appeared in the All- Star game and was third in the Cy Young Award voting that year. His injury problems marred his success from that point forward, with his best post- Cardinals year being in San Diego, where he helped the Padres capture the NL West division title. In 1992 Tewksbury walked only 20 batters in 233 innings, the best ratio in the major leagues in over half a century. The next season Tewksbury came very close to ending the season with more wins than bases on balls allowed, an elusive feat only accomplished 4 times by 3 different starting pitchers in MLB history. He had 17 wins with only 18 walks allowed late in the season but gave up a walk apiece in his last two starts and did not achieve a win in either game, ending the season with 17 wins on 20 walks. In 1997, the ever-crafty Tewksbury threw an Eephus pitch, joining an elite few who have thrown the \\"junkiest pitch in baseball.\\" He threw it to power-hitter Mark McGwire in an interleague play game at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and McGwire grounded out on the pitch ‚Äì twice. Tewksbury's son, Griffin, has been quoted as calling this pitch \\"The Dominator.\\" During and after his baseball career, he became well known for his philanthropy. He has done a lot of work for the Boys and Girls Club of America, as well as hospital visits for sick children. After retirement After retiring, Tewksbury worked as a player development consultant for the Boston Red Sox and appeared as a commentator for Red Sox coverage on the New England Sports Network He earned his bachelor of science degree in physical education at St. Leo University in 2000 and earned his master's degree in psychology at Boston University in 2004. Tewksbury has been a sports psychology coach since 2004. He is an Adjunct Professor of Sport Psychology & Exercise at NHTI, Concord's Community College. Tewksbury still lives in New Hampshire, continuing his charitable work. Tewksbury played himself in the movie The Scout.

Cohen, 1982 photo Samuel Theodore Cohen\\"Samuel T. Cohen dies at 89; Inventor of the Neutron Bomb\\" Los Angeles Times 2 December 2010 (January 25, 1921 ‚Äì November 28, 2010) was an American physicist who is generally credited as the father of the neutron bomb. Biography Cohen's parents were Austrian Jews who emigrated from London, England. He was born on January 25, 1921, in Brooklyn and raised in New York City. He studied mathematics and physics at University of California, Los Angeles before joining the United States Army after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1944 he worked on the Manhattan Project in the efficiency group at Los Alamos and calculated how neutrons behaved in Fat Man, the atomic bomb that was later detonated over Nagasaki, Japan. After the war he studied for his Ph.D. at Berkeley before dropping out to join the RAND Corporation. At RAND Corporation in 1950, his work on the intensity of fallout radiation first became public when his calculations were included as a special appendix in Samuel Glasstone's book The Effects of Atomic Weapons. Cohen was personally responsible for recruiting the famous strategist Herman Kahn into the RAND Corporation.http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&id;=817 Samuel T. Cohen, Los Alamos identification badge photo During the Vietnam War, Cohen argued that using small neutron bombs would end the war quickly and save many American lives, but politicians were not amenable to his ideas and other scientists ignored the neutron bomb in reviewing the role of nuclear weapons. He was a member of the Los Alamos Tactical Nuclear Weapons Panel in the early 1970s. President Carter delayed development of the neutron bomb in 1978, but during Ronald Reagan's presidency, Cohen claims to have convinced Reagan to make 700 neutron bombs, 350 shells to go into the 8 inch (200-millimeter) howitzer and 350 W70 Mod. 3 warheads for the Lance missile. =\\"Clean\\" nuclear tests= In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced the testing of a 95% \\"clean\\" (2-stage) fusion weapon, later identified to have been the 11 July Navajo test at Bikini Atoll during Operation Redwing. This weapon had a yield of 4.5 megatons. Previous \\"dirty\\" weapons had fission proportions of 50‚Äì77%, due to the use of uranium-238 as a \\"pusher\\" around the lithium deuteride (secondary) stage. This is deliberate; the fusion reactions give off large quantities of 14.1 M neutrons, which have more energy than the 1.1 MeV \\"fission threshold\\" for U-238. This means the neutrons, which would otherwise escape, create fission reactions in the neutron reflecting 'tamper', increasing the overall yield of the weapon essentially \\"for free\\". The 1956 \\"clean\\" tests used a lead pusher, while in 1958 a tungsten carbide pusher was employed. Hans A. Bethe supported clean nuclear weapons in 1958 as Chairman of a Presidential science advisory group on nuclear testing:http://worf.eh.doe.gov/data/ihp1b/7374_.pdf > ... certain hard targets require ground bursts, such as airfield runways if > it is desired to make a crater, railroad yards if severe destruction of > tracks is to be accomplished ... The use of clean weapons in strategic > situations may be indicated in order to protect the local population. > ‚Äì Dr. Hans Bethe, Working Group Chairman, 27 March 1958 \\"Top Secret ‚Äì > Restricted Data\\" Report to the NSC Ad Hoc Working Group on the Technical > Feasibility of a Cessation of Nuclear Testing, p 9. In consequence of Bethe's recommendations, on 12 July 1958, the Hardtack- Poplar shot of the Mk-41C warhead was carried out on a barge in the lagoon yielded 9.3 megatons, of which only 4.8% was fission, and thus 95.2% \\"clean\\". In 1958, Cohen investigated a low-yield \\"clean\\" nuclear weapon and discovered that the \\"clean\\" bomb case thickness scales as the cube root of yield. So a larger percentage of neutrons escapes from a small detonation, due to the thinner case required to reflect back X-rays during the secondary stage (fusion) ignition. For example, a 1-kiloton bomb only needs a case one-tenth the thickness of that required for 1-megaton. So, although most neutrons are absorbed by the casing in a 1-megaton bomb, in a 1-kiloton bomb they would mostly escape. A neutron bomb is only feasible if the yield is sufficiently high that efficient fusion stage ignition is possible, and if the yield is low enough that the case thickness will not absorb too many neutrons. This means that neutron bombs have a yield range of 1‚Äì10 kilotons, with fission proportion varying from 50% at 1-kiloton to 25% at 10-kilotons (all of which comes from the primary stage). The neutron output per kiloton is then 10‚Äì15 times greater than for a pure fission implosion weapon or for a strategic warhead like a W87 or W88. =U.S. Department of Defense manual on the neutron bomb= Cohen's neutron bomb is not mentioned in the unclassified manual by Glasstone and Dolan, The Effects of Nuclear Weapons 1957‚Äì1977, but is included as an \\"enhanced neutron weapon\\" in chapter 5 of the declassified (formerly secret) manual edited by Philip J. Dolan, Capabilities of Nuclear Weapons, U.S. Department of Defense, effects manual DNA-EM-1, updated 1981 (U.S. Freedom of Information Act). Under most atmospheric conditions no fallout effects would occur from the use of a neutron bomb, according to that manual, as the combination of 500-meter burst altitude and low yield prevents fallout in addition to significant thermal and blast effects. The reduction in damage outside the target area is a major advantage of such a weapon to deter massed tank invasions. An aggressor would thus be forced to disperse tanks, which would make them easier to destroy by simple hand-held anti-tank missile launchers. Cohen's backing of investigations into these controversial ideas won him some media attention after many years of being ignored. In 1992 he was featured in the award-winning BBC TV series Pandora's Box, episode \\"To the Brink of Eternity\\", discussing his battles with officialdom and colleagues at the RAND Corporation. Cohen controversially argued: \\"When we started this systems analysis business, we stepped through the looking glass where people did the weirdest things and (used) the most perverse kind of logic imaginable and yet claimed to have the most precise understanding of everything.\\"Santa Monica Mirror: RAND and the City: Part V Alleged support from the Pope for low-yield tactical nuclear bombs Cohen reportedly worked in France on low- yield, highly discriminate tactical nuclear weapons in 1979‚Äì80. He claimed that he was awarded a medal by Pope John Paul II in 1979 for his bid to reform modern warfare. Author Charles Platt reported in a 2005 profile of Sam Cohen that \\"... he showed me the Medal of Peace that he had received from the Pope in 1979.\\" At the time, Warsaw Pact forces had a massive tank superiority in Europe (though NATO maintained an overall strategic superiority); the Christian Science Monitor reported in 1981 that there were \\"19,500 tanks in the Soviet-controlled forces of the Warsaw Pact aimed at Western Europe. Of these, 12,500 are Soviet tanks in Soviet units. NATO has 7,000 tanks on its side facing the 19,500.\\" A deterrent which was designed to minimise civilian casualties was a step away from the risk of indiscriminate warfare. The neutron bomb's killing by neutron radiation is different from the fallout of a normal high yield thermonuclear weapon because it can be controlled more precisely, restricted to military targets and kept away from civilians. The speed of modern warfare meant that the civilian population would be unlikely to be able to withdraw from combat zones and would suffer a large number of deaths in a nuclear war where the blast yields and fallout were significant. Because neutron bombs do not produce the indiscriminate blast (only 40 kilopascals at ground zero from a 1 kt blast yield detonation at 500 m altitude, and only 7 kPa at 2 km distance), heat, and fallout damage of other nuclear weapons, they were more credible as a deterrent to Soviet tanks. However, many people believed that the very deployment of the neutron bomb threatened an escalation to full-scale nuclear retaliation, thus canceling out the supposed benefits. Advances in precision anti-tank weapons ultimately made the neutron bomb redundant tactically in its original objective. The debate over \\"clean\\" low yield nuclear weapons continues with earth penetrator technology (\\"nuclear bunker busters\\"). =Red Mercury claims= More recently, Cohen was the main proponent of what most consider to be a mythical substance, red mercury. If the \\"conventional story\\" is to be believed, red mercury was a disinformation campaign led by US government agencies in order to lure potential terrorists into being captured. The story that was released was that red mercury was developed by the Soviet Union as a \\"shortcut\\" to a fusion bomb, and that with the fall of the Soviet Union it was being offered on the market by the Soviet mafia. When prospective buyers showed up to take delivery of the material, they were arrested. During the height of the story, in the 1990s, Cohen became a proponent of red mercury. He claimed not only that it existed, but that he knew its nature; it was a powerful ballotechnic material that directly compressed the fusion fuel without the need for a fission primary. Bombs using red mercury had no real critical mass and could be developed at any size. He further claimed that the Soviets had produced a number of \\"micro-nukes\\" based on red mercury, which are described as being about as large as a baseball and weighing 10 pounds. According to Cohen, their existence meant that any effort to control nuclear proliferation based on fissile material was thus hopeless. A reiteration of the claim can be seen in The Nuclear Threat That Doesn't Exist ‚Äì or Does It or No?, by Cohen and Joe Douglass in an 11 March 2003 guest editorial in Financial Sense Online. =Political involvement= In 1984, in a cover story for the libertarian magazine Reason, Cohen expressed support for the construction of a nuclear- radiation field along the borders of Israel as a means of protecting it from the military forces of other nations and killing anyone who approached it via gamma radiation. \\"What I am suggesting is the construction of a border barrier whose most effective component is an extremely intense field of nuclear radiation (produced by the operation of underground nuclear reactors), sharply confined to the barrier zone, which practically guarantees the death of anyone attempting to breach the barrier,\\" he wrote. \\"Establishing such a 'nuclear wall' at the borders of a threatened country can make virtually impossible any successful penetration by ground forces ‚Äì as well as a preemptive ground attack by the threatened country.\\" Cohen spoke at an April 2000 fundraiser in La Canada, California, for then-Reform Party presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan.\\"Buchanan promises to protect border.\\" Los Angeles Times. April 30, 2000. Irv Rubin was prominently present at this event, with his organization, the Jewish Defense League (JDL), and with members of the Libertarian Party, to protest. The JDL posted Cohen's home phone number and address on its website, urging its members to contact him, to persuade him to stop supporting Buchanan.Raimondo, Justin. \\"Wild About Harry: Why I am not Voting Libertarian this Year.\\" Antiwar.com June 14, 2000. Accessed August 11, 2009. In her address to the 2000 Reform Party National Convention, Buchanan's running mate, Ezola Foster, cited Cohen's endorsement of Buchanan to refute the claim that the candidate was anti-Semitic.Foster, Ezola. \\"Reform Party Vice Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech. August 12, 2000. Accessed August 11, 2009. Support for Baptist pastor and author William P. Grady As part of a self- described unusual friendship, Cohen wrote the afterword to William P. Grady's 2005 bestseller titled How Satan Turned America Against God. Cohen explained that although he was an unbelieving Jew, and thus could not relate to the spiritual content of the book, he concurred with Grady's grasp of America's disastrous foreign policy.Grady, William. How Satan Turned America Against God, Afterword, 2005.\\" Death He died on November 28, 2010 in Brentwood, Los Angeles, from complications of his stomach cancer. In popular culture On the DVD of the film Repo Man (which contains a fictional character loosely based on Cohen and the neutron bomb as a plot device), Cohen is interviewed in the commentary on the deleted scenes. During the interview, Cohen asserts that the neutron bomb conforms to just war theories. References Further reading * Hans A.

It was owned by Fred Sands, and broadcast at 105.5 MHz for nine years, from January 8, 1986, to February 15, 1995; immediately after the \\"sign-off\\", it was replaced by the Spanish- language radio station known as KBUE (Que Buena). In February 1998, however, KNAC was revived as an internet-based radio station, which still exists to this day. Prior to 1986, KNAC had existed in several different formats, including \\"freeform\\" and the new wave/alternative rock format \\"Rock N Rhythm\\". History =KNAC at 105.5 FM= The original KNAC was based in Long Beach, California and served Los Angeles and Orange counties on the FM band at a center frequency of 105.5 MHz. KNAC-FM had a variety of different formats. With a relatively weak radio signal and a small geographical area, KNAC never appeared in the Arbitron radio ratings. Outside the Los Angeles area, the station gained a huge following from heavy metal fans across the United States (via marketing and selling of t-shirts, stickers, compact discs, etc., with ads in heavy metal fan magazines). Before KNAC became popular under the heavy metal format, KNAC was branded as \\"The Knack.\\" KNAC was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in the \\"Legends of Rock Radio-Stations\\" category in 2014. =Freeform era= In the late 1960s through the late 1970s, the Rock format KNAC ran was referred to as \\"freeform.\\" A \\"freeform\\" radio format gives the on-air talent almost total control over what music to play, regardless of commercial concerns. Popular performers of the time such as Avant-garde Experimental music artist Frank Zappa and comical theatre troupe The Firesign Theatre would stop by the stations studios to perform live or act as guest DJs. During the early part of this era, the station's on-air personalities would often perform their shifts while smoking marijuana or after having consumed other illicit drugs and alcoholic beverages usually provided by the mainstream record promoters in an effort to get their albums noticed, as many of so-called \\"underground\\" stations of the era were also known to do across the country. During the early days of KNAC some of L.A.'s diamonds in the rough were found. Most notably, Ron McCoy (6 A.M. to Noon) was not only the Program Director but also a seasoned musician with the hard rock recording group MSG (not to be confused with the hard rock band led by guitarist Michael Schenker) who released Little Suzie Looker (Hooker) and other regional hits. Jim Ladd (12 noon to 6 P.M.), who later moved to KLOS, would become one of the first nationally syndicated jocks with The Inner View along with his partner Jerry Longdon (12 A.M. to 6 A.M.), who went on to become the announcer on Don Kirshner's ABC TV show In Concert (Ladd has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame). Frank Jolley (7 P.M to Midnight) was the first at KNAC to appear in the L.A. Arbitron with a very respectable showing. That performance brought him to the attention of Southern Pacific's KKDJ, who hired him. Jolley would later become a motion picture producer and mentor chairman of the Producers Guild of America. While at KNAC Jolley produced the first-ever feature film for the infant cable TV industry, winning him the 1972 National Cable Television Association Award for his production of ZEBRA-9.Free Form Radio: Kmet Fm History As a freeform radio station, KNAC featured typical rock artists of the day such as The Beatles, The Who, Rolling Stones, The Kinks, Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Yes, Pink Floyd, Genesis, among others. With its liberal on-air format, however, KNAC also played album tracks or songs by the more popular rock music artists that other radio stations would generally not play. In addition, KNAC broadcast artists that received less airplay on more commercial rock stations. These artists could include anyone from San Francisco Bay Area psychedelic music act It's a Beautiful Day, blues rock group Electric Flag, to progressive rock acts such as the Moody Blues. Some rhythm and blues, soul and funk artists including Sly and the Family Stone, B.B. King, Chambers Brothers and Funkadelic were also heard on KNAC. The station's owners during that period were Jim and Claudia Harden. By the middle of the 1970s the underground and counterculture movements of the 1960s were giving way to newer subcultures. In response, KNAC started to play more punk rock and new wave music. By the late 1970s, KNAC had begun to evolve into an eclectic alternative music station. =Alternative music era= During the first half of the 1980s, KNAC ran an alternative music format. KNAC was known in the early 1980s as \\"Rock 'N' Rhythm 105.5 KNAC,\\" developed by program director and afternoon drive DJ Jimmy \\"The Armored Saint\\" Christopher. KNAC had a reputation as a cutting-edge station that played music that would later be added to stations like KROQ-FM. Bands like The Jam, Lone Justice, The Blasters, Elvis Costello and Dave Edmunds frequently visited the station's Long Beach studio. The station was considered influential in bringing about a thriving alternative music scene in Orange County and Long Beach. Members of Sublime and No Doubt would listen religiously every Sunday night to Roberto Angotti's \\"Reggae Revolution\\" from 1982 to 1986. Angotti was responsible for launching the careers of UB40, Steel Pulse, Pato Banton, Tippa Irie, Macka B, Mad Professor and many other British-based artists. He would venture to Jamaica to document the roots of reggae and recorded Peter Tosh's final interview before his untimely death. \\"Reggae Revolution\\" was the only radio show that survived the \\"Pure Rock\\" format change, as Angotti took the #1 Arbitron rated program to KROQ in Pasadena/Burbank, where he would remain until his move to 91X in San Diego in the early 1990s. Announcers Norm McBride, Sylvia Aimerito,http://audiogirlproductions.com/wp- content/uploads/2015/04/Sylvia-Aimerito-Career-Overview-Resume_2015.pdf Mary Hogins, Kat Snow, Rick Stuart, Soup Sullivan, Roland West, J Pearce, Doug Adams and Manny Pacheco were a few of the popular DJs of this time. =Heavy metal era= In 1984, Fred Sands purchased the radio station at a bankruptcy auction. Sands advertised in trade publications indicating his desire to hire a general manager with major market experience. Gary \\"The Coach\\" Price, an industry veteran, took the job and worked with Sands, who was intimately involved for the first year. The antenna was moved from Signal Hill to Dominguez Hills, increasing the coverage area. In addition, Sands and Price ordered and installed state-of-the-art equipment for the new studio location and hired a new engineer. With all the new improvements, Sands and Price recognized that KNAC needed a new sound as well. Under the direction of consultant Jeff Pollack and Associates they selected a heavy metal format, targeting younger demographics. The birth of the \\"Pure Rock\\" format was the response to Iron Maiden selling out four shows in a row at the Long Beach Arena on their Powerslave tour with no significant radio airplay. For the first time KNAC appeared in the Arbitron ratings, and, once established, the station took in revenues of at least a million dollars per year. During the nine-year \\"Pure Rock\\" era, the KNAC program directors were Jimmy \\"The Armored Saint\\" Christopher, Tommy Marshall, Pamela Edwards, Gregg Steele, and Bryan \\"Shock\\" Schock. Among the music directors at KNAC during that time frame were Kevin Stephens, Ross Goza, and Michael \\"Jack The Ripper\\" Davis. Original on- air talent included Teddy \\"Thrasher/Thrashpie\\" Pritchard, Katherine \\"Killer Kat\\" Snow, Billy \\"Wild Bill\\" Scott, Lady Di, Gregory \\"Gonzo Greg\\" Spillane, Sammy Frez, Stewart \\"Stew\\" Herrera, Paul Lobster, Long Paul, The Razor, Darren \\"Dangerous\\" Silva, with Scorchin' Scotty, and the late Tawn \\"The Leather Nun\\" Mastery who took over Killer Kat's shift in 1986. KNAC played a wide variety of heavy metal and rock-based music from the late-1960s to 1995, the radio station's last year on the air, including classic rock, hard rock, traditional heavy metal, progressive rock/metal, power metal, glam metal, thrash metal, crossover thrash, death metal, groove metal, alternative metal and grunge. KNAC was also responsible for helping launch the careers of previously low-key metal and hard rock bands, and is often credited for being the first radio station to promote new bands before their large-scale success, including Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Bon Jovi, Megadeth, Skid Row, Metal Church, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots, White Zombie, Poison, Testament, Stryper, Lizzy Borden and Armored Saint. Sands and Price had worked together for about ten years. Sands sold the radio station in 1994 for five times what he paid for it in 1984. Decline in popularity By late 1991, heavy metal was losing ground to the growing popularity of various \\"alternative subcultures\\". In trying to keep up with the times, KNAC began adding more music acts popular in the alternative music genre to its playlist rotation. The majority of these were the more guitar-based grunge acts like Pearl Jam and Nirvana as well as punk acts like The Offspring. While fans of the more adventurous and alternative earlier KNAC incarnation heralded a possible return to the previous format, many metal fans disliked KNAC's new sound, and the station, already in ratings trouble, saw further declines in audience shares. In October 1994, management announced that KNAC was being sold and would switch to a Spanish-language music format in February 1995. Heavy metal fans began tuning in again to find that KNAC had returned to its metal format for the few last months. Once again, headbangers could hear the classic metal they had not heard in a while, like Megadeth or Saxon. The last day of KNAC took place on February 15, 1995, and James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich of Metallica appeared as guests to show their support. The last song to be played on KNAC was Metallica's \\"Fade to Black\\" (which was played during the first hour of the metal format 9 years earlier). At 1:59 p.m., KNAC went off the air with a short farewell message from general manager Gary Price: \\"This is KNAC Long Beach-Los Angeles. KNAC's Pure Rock is now signing off. Thanks for your support. You have been the greatest.\\" This was followed by seconds of silence before playing Mariachi Sol de Mexico's \\"Guadalajara\\". The 105.5 frequency became Que Buena KBUE. Return via World Wide Web In 1998, under the guidance of record company promoter Rob Jones, Jr.,\\"Tuning in to radio's wired wave\\" USA Today December 23, 1998 a group of former KNAC staffers revived the station via Internet at KNAC.COM, utilizing the relatively new technology of streaming audio. The music resembles that of the \\"halcyon days\\" of the 1980s, complete with the white-on-black KNAC logo and other on-air features. In early 2001, the KNAC.COM brand and website was licensed by arrangement to Clear Channel Interactive through a merger with Enigma Digital, previous licensor of the KNAC.COM brand and website in 1999. This license remained effective until November 2001 when Clear Channel shuttered its Internet division. Reunions In June 2007, it was announced that KNAC DJ Tawn Mastrey had to leave her job as host of Hair Nation on Sirius Satellite Radio as a result of complications caused by Hepatitis C; she died from the disease on October 2, 2007.KNAC.COM - News - Remembering Tawn To build awareness of Mastrey's situation, a KNAC-FM \\"On Air\\" reunion was held on July 28, 2007 at WPMD.org on the campus of Cerritos College in Norwalk, California, which included many of the original KNAC air personalities and Price.KNAC-FM On-Air Reunion at mikestark.net To coincide with its 30th anniversary, two KNAC reunions took place on January 8‚Äì9, 2016. On January 8, former KNAC DJ Ted \\"Thrasher\\" Pritchard hosted a reunion show on his podcast \\"Thrashpie Radio\\", where many of the DJs, production directors, and other former employees of KNAC (including general manager Gary \\"The Coach\\" Price) shared their experiences at the radio station. The podcast also included audio clips from various KNAC events, as well as bumper sticker advertisements and promos.http://screamermagazine.com/hollywood- spotlight/update-knac-105-5-pure-rock-jocks-confirmed-for-30th-anniversary- podcast/ On the day after, Los Angeles rock station KLOS hosted a five-hour KNAC tribute, titled \\"The KNAC Pure Rock Salute\\", hosted by former KNAC DJs Stew, Gonzo Greg, Long Paul, Thrasher and Dangerous Darren Silva. The \\"Pure Rock Salute\\" duplicated KNAC's format, complete with imaging, bumper sticker advertisements, and many songs that had not been played on terrestrial radio in Los Angeles since KNAC signed off two-and-a-half decades earlier. It also included interviews with Scott Ian, Rob Halford and Lars Ulrich (who DJ'd on the final day of KNAC in 1995). The \\"Pure Rock Salute\\" broadcast is available for download at archive.org.

toxic. Symptoms of milk sickness include vomiting.  Medicinal Use  Ageratina pichinchensis is a traditional Mexican treatment for superficial fungal infections of the skin. These plant extracts contain encecalin which has activity to inhibit and kill the fungus. Studies have compared its effectiveness in treating toenail fungus with ciclopirox. Long used in India to treat snakebite, epilepsy, mental disorders. It was also discovered to be useful in regulating hypertension discovered in 1949, but it causes various side effects. Used to treat schizophrenia due to the alkaloid reserpine it contains. There are many indigenous cultures that have used snakeroot for its ability to grow hair on the surface of the nose and tongue. One such use of snakeroot for this purpose comes from the practices of external alchemy as practiced in Daoism, because hair grown on the nose and tongue by the use of snakeroot is considered a place for one to absorb energy into the body from one's surroundings. Native Americans, Indigenous Siberians, and Indigenous tribes in Africa have also used snakeroot for these purposes.

The film is based on the life of American postmodernist/neo expressionist artist Jean- Michel Basquiat. Basquiat, born in Brooklyn, used his graffiti roots as a foundation to create collage-style paintings on canvas. Jeffrey Wright portrays Basquiat, and David Bowie plays Basquiat's friend and mentor Andy Warhol. Additional cast members include Gary Oldman as a thinly disguised Schnabel, Michael Wincott as the poet and art critic Rene Ricard, Dennis Hopper as Bruno Bischofberger, Parker Posey as gallery owner Mary Boone, Christopher Walken as a villainous journalist, Willem Dafoe as an electrician, and Claire Forlani, Courtney Love, Tatum O'Neal, and Benicio del Toro in supporting roles as \\"composite characters\\".  Plot  The film is a lightly fictionalised account of Basquiat's life. Initially a struggling artist living in a cardboard box in Tompkins Square Park, he works his way up the rungs of the New York art world in the eighties, thanks in part to his association with Andy Warhol (David Bowie), the art dealer Bruno Bischofberger (Dennis Hopper), poet and critic Ren√© Ricard (Michael Wincott), and fellow artist Albert Milo (Gary Oldman). Alongside the development of his artistic career, the film also follows Basquiat's tumultuous relationship with Gina (Claire Forlani), a fellow aspiring artist he meets while she is working as a waitress at a diner he frequents with his friend Benny (Benicio del Toro). Their romance is affected by Basquiat's affair with the so-called \\"Big Pink\\" (Courtney Love), a woman he picks up on the street, and his habitual abuse of heroin. Eventually, Basquiat finds himself isolated by his fame, the death of Warhol and his drug use. The film ends with a title card informing the audience that Jean-Michel Basquiat died of a heroin overdose on August 12, 1988, at the age of 27. Cast * Jeffrey Wright as Jean-Michel Basquiat * David Bowie as Andy Warhol * Benicio del Toro as Benny Dalmau * Dennis Hopper as Bruno Bischofberger * Gary Oldman as Albert Milo * Michael Wincott as Ren√© Ricard * Claire Forlani as Gina Cardinale * Parker Posey as Mary Boone * Courtney Love as Big Pink * Elina L√∂wensohn as Annina Nosei * Paul Bartel as Henry Geldzahler * Tatum O'Neal as Cynthia Kruger * Christopher Walken as The Interviewer * Willem Dafoe as the Electrician * Sam Rockwell as Thug Production =Writing= The film has a screenplay by Schnabel and a story by John Bowe, Michael Holman‚Äîa former member of theatrical rock group The Tubes, had first met Basquiat in 1979 and together that year they founded an experimental, industrial/electronica group called Gray.‚Äîand Lech Majewski. =Schnabel's art in film= As director, Schnabel inserted himself into the film by adding the fictional character, Albert Milo (Gary Oldman), who he based on himself. Schnabel also added cameo appearances by his mother, father, and daughter (as Milo's family). Schnabel himself appeared as an extra as a waiter. Basquiat was the first commercial feature film about a painter made by a painter. Schnabel said: > \\"I know what it's like to be attacked as an artist. I know what it's like to > be judged as an artist. I know what it's like to arrive as an artist and > have fame and notoriety. I know what it's like to be accused of things that > you never said or did. I know what it's like to be described as a piece of > hype. I know what it's like to be appreciated as well as > degraded.\\"\\"Basquiat\\" Interview. Ingrid Sischy. ArtForum July 1996. Basquiat died in 1988 of mixed-drug toxicity (he had been combining cocaine and heroin, known as \\"speedballing\\"). Basquiat's estate would not grant permission for his work to be used in the film. Schnabel and his studio assistant Greg Bogin created paintings \\"in the style of\\" Basquiat for the film.Charlie Rose interview with Julian Schnabel and David Bowie on the movie Basquiat. Aired on WNET, Channel 13, New York, Friday August 9, 1996. =Casting= After the film was released, Jeffrey Wright said that \\"I think my performance was appropriated, literally, and the way I was edited was appropriated in the same way his [Basquiat's] story has been appropriated and that he was appropriated when he was alive. [...] Julian made him out to be too docile and too much of a victim and too passive and not as dangerous as he really was. It's about containing Basquiat. It's about aggrandizing himself through Basquiat's memory.\\"Phoebe Hoban. Basquiat: A Quick Killing in the Art World (second edition). Penguin Books. New York, 2004. Comparing Bowie's portrayal of Warhol to others who've portrayed Warhol prior, Paul Morrissey (who directed many films that Warhol produced) said \\"Bowie was the best by far. You come away from Basquiat thinking Andy was comical and amusing, not a pretentious, phony piece of shit, which is how others show him.\\" He also noted that \\"Bowie at least knew Andy. They went to the same parties.\\" Bowie was able to borrow Warhol's actual wig, glasses and jacket from the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh for the film. Writer Bob Colacello, who edited Warhol's Interview magazine in the 70's and early 80's, said \\"[Crispin] Glover walked the most like [the real] Andy, [Jared] Harris talked the most like Andy, and Bowie looked the most like Andy. When I first saw Bowie on the set, it was like Andy had been resurrected.\\" In 2018, musician and actor Lenny Kravitz revealed in an interview with V Magazine that he had been asked by director Julian Schnabel to play the role of Basquiat. Kravitz said, \\"I look back and I'm like, wow, I probably should have done that\\". Release =Box office= Basquiat opened theatrically on August 9, 1996 in 6 venues, earning $83,863 in its first weekend. The film ultimately grossed $3,011,195 domestically. =Critical reception= The film received positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 70% rating based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. Metacritic reports a 65 out of 100 rating based on 20 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three and a half out of a possible four stars stating that in Schnabel's portrayal Basquiat \\"is a quiet, almost wordless presence, a young man who rarely says what he is thinking and often deliberately chooses to miss the point of a conversation. He is dreamy, sweet, and pensive. There are deep hurts and angers\\".Ebert, Roger. Basquiat. Chicago Sun-Times. August 16, 1996. Retrieved August 31, 2012. Similarly, Janet Maslin in The New York Times called the film \\"bold, attention-getting and more than a little facile, a stylish-looking film without the connective tissue to give it real depth.\\"Janet Maslin, \\"Basquiat: A Postcard Picture of a Graffiti Artist\\" New York Times, August 9, 1996. http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E07E4DF123EF93AA3575BC0A960958260 David Bonetti gave the film a poor review due to his perception of the inexperience of the director stating \\"Schnabel can't decide whether he wants to tell a traditional rise-and-fall morality tale or make an art film. His attempt at telling Basquiat's story straightforwardly collapses under its own banality\\". Similarly, the Los Angeles Examiner said that \\"Basquiat does not seem interested in anything that doesn't advance its director's personal agenda.\\" The review stated that \\"Though as a writer-director, Schnabel's work is not the total fiasco the debut films of fellow artists David Salle (Search and Destroy) and Robert Longo (Johnny Mnemonic) were, it is fascinating to see what a compendium of Troubled Genius movie cliches he has turned out.\\" Like several of the negative reviews, the review picked out for praise the acting of Jeffrey Wright as Jean-Michel Basquiat, saying \\"Basquiat's only genuine inspiration was casting Jeffrey Wright, who won a Tony for his work in Angels in America on the New York stage, as the artist. An actor whose talent is visible even in this standard role, Wright's ability creates more interest in Basquiat's fate than would otherwise exist.\\"Kenneth Turan. \\"Movie Review: Basquiat: The Tortures of Creative Life\\" Los Angeles Times, Friday August 9, 1996. http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl- movie960809-2,0,6464898.story The reviews in the art press focused more on the relation of Schnabel as director to his portrayal of Schnabel as artist in the film, and on changes to the facts of Basquiat's life introduced by Schnabel to make a more accessible film. In Art in America, the art critic Brooks Adams wrote: > Basquiat can be seen as a huge, lurking self-portrait of the artist- > Schnabel, not Basquiat. So laden is the film with the innumerable > coincidences of Basquiat and Schnabel's enthusiasms (among others, for > pajamas and surfing) that the movie should be more appropriately called My > Basquiat...

The marriage was arranged as a condition of the Treaty of Rouen, and James was originally to be betrothed to another bride, but he preferred Madeleine. They married, but her health, poor since birth, failed and she died six months after the wedding, resulting in her nickname, the \\"Summer Queen\\" of Scots.  Early life  Madeleine (back right) with her mother and sisters, from the Book of Hours of Catherine de'Medici. Madeleine was born at Saint- Germain-en-Laye, France, the fifth child and third daughter of King Francis I of France and Claude, Duchess of Brittany (daughter of King Louis XII of France and Anne, Duchess of Brittany). Very frail from birth, she grew up in the warm and temperate Loire Valley region of France, rather than at Paris, as her father feared that the cold would destroy her delicate health. Together with her sister Margaret, she was raised by her aunt, Marguerite de Navarre. This lasted until her father remarried and his new wife, Eleanor of Austria, took them into her own household. By her sixteenth birthday, she had contracted tuberculosis.  Marriage negotiations  Three years before Madeleine's birth, the Franco-Scottish Treaty of Rouen was made to bolster the Auld Alliance after Scotland's defeat at the Battle of Flodden. A marriage to a French Princess for the Scottish King was one of its provisions. In April 1530, John Stewart, Duke of Albany, was appointed commissioner to finalise the royal marriage between James V and Madeleine.Hay, Denys, Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 43‚Äì44, 51‚Äì52, 170. However, as Madeleine did not enjoy good health, another French bride, Mary of Bourbon, was proposed. James V contracted to marry Mary of Bourbon, and travelled to France in 1536 to meet her, but smitten with the delicate Madeleine, he asked Francis I for her hand in marriage. Fearing the harsh climate of Scotland would prove fatal to his daughter's already failing health, Francis I initially refused to permit the marriage. James V continued to press Francis I for Madeleine's hand, and despite his reservations and nagging fears, Francis I reluctantly granted permission to the marriage only after Madeleine made her interest in marrying James very obvious. The pair married on 1 January 1537 at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.\\"Why did the 'Rough Wooing' Fail to break the Auld Alliance?\\" Francis I also provided Madeleine with a very generous (and much needed) dowry, which considerably boosted the Scottish treasury. According to the marriage contract made at Blois, Madeleine renounced her and any of her heirs' claims to the French throne. If James died first, Madeleine would retain for her lifetime assets including the Earldoms of Fife, Strathearn, Ross, and Orkney with Falkland Palace, Stirling Castle, and Dingwall Castle, with the Lordship of Galloway and Threave Castle.Hay, Denys, Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 325‚Äì6. Coat of arms of Madeleine of Valois as Queen consort of Scots  Queen of Scots  After months of festivities and celebrations, the couple left France for Scotland in May 1537. By this time, Madeleine's health had deteriorated even further, and she was very sick when the royal pair landed in Scotland. They arrived at Leith at 10 o'clock on Whitsun-eve, 19 May.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5 part 4 cont., (1836), 79, Clifford to Henry VIII.

Death  Madeleine wrote to her father from Edinburgh on 8 June 1537 saying that she was better and her symptoms had diminished.Hay, Denys, Letters of James V, HMSO (1954), 331‚Äì2. However, a month later, on 7 July 1537, (a month before her 17th birthday), Madeleine, the so-called \\"Summer Queen\\" of Scots, died in her husband's arms at Edinburgh, Scotland. Queen Madeleine was interred in the Royal Chapel Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh, next to King James II of Scotland. The grave was desecrated by a mob in 1776 and her allegedly still beautiful head was stolen.Grants Old and New Edinburgh Commemoration Madeleine's marriage and death was commemorated by the poet David Lyndsay's Deploration of Deith of Quene Magdalene; the poem describes the pageantry of the marriage in France and Scotland: > O Paris! Of all citeis principall! > Quhilk did resave our prince with laud and glorie, > Solempnitlie, throw arkis triumphall.

Less than a year after her death, her husband married the widowed Mary of Guise, who had attended his wedding to Madeleine. Twenty years later, listed amongst the treasures in Edinburgh Castle were two little gold cups, an agate basin, a jasper vase, and crystal jug given to Madeleine when she was a child in France.Thomson, Thomas, A Collection of Inventories, Bannatyne Club (1815), 63.

Apart from India, lungis are also worn in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal. It is also known as a longyi in Singapore, Cambodia, Burma, and Thailand. The lungi is a particularly popular form of casual wear and night wear for men in regions where the heat and humidity of the climate make it unpleasant and uncomfortable to wear closed and tight garments such as trousers.http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale- the-lungi-aesthete/story Design They are especially worn in hot regions. There are also cheaper \\"open\\" lungis, in identical dimensions but not sewn into a tube shape. The standard adult lungi is 115 cm in height and 200 cm in length, when open. Children's lungis are available in approximately 2/3 of this size. They are normally woven from cotton and come in a variety of designs and colors. Silk lungis are available for ceremonial purposes such as weddings. The most common styles are either solid-colored or plaid, reflecting the relative ease and cost-effectiveness of producing these patterns on a power loom. Blue is particularly popular, since it fades to pleasant tones in contrast to other colors. Regardless of the design or color, lungis are often lined at the top and bottom with a black/white stripe containing reinforced weaving to prevent fraying.The border of a Bangladeshi lungi, showing the black & white reinforced weave border to minimize fraying Usage Depending on local tradition, lungis can be worn by men and/or women (rarely). They are tied or fastened in various ways, and can be used in different cultural activities, ranging from normal daily life to elaborate wedding ceremonies. For daily purposes, a simple \\"double twist\\" knot is most popular, where two points in the upper edge of lungi are brought together and twisted around twice, with the ends tucked in at the waist. However, it is also common for wearers to simply tie a double \\"pretzel knot\\" from 2 points on the upper border, which produces a more secure knot. The lungi's length can also be adjusted, for example, by tucking in the lungi at the waist to make it resemble a short skirt. This is mostly used for labourers who have to work for a long time under a hot sun. Regional variations = India = In India, the lungi was traditional dress of Austrasitic and Dravidian origion people. The customs behind wearing lungis vary by state. It could be worn with or without the traditional unsewn kaupinam or later-era sewn langot, both of which are type of traditional loincloth undergarments. Salt-field worker in Tamil Nadu wearing Lungi in typical tucked-up position for Work In Kerala, the lungi is generally colourful and available in various designs, and it is worn by both men and women. It is also called Kaili. Physical laborers typically use it as a working dress. A Kerala dhoti is plain white and known as mundu, and it often bears golden embroidery (known as \\"kasavu\\" mundu), especially at the border; it is worn as formal attire and on ceremonial occasions like weddings, festivals, etc. Saffron-coloured mundus are known as kaavi munde. The men sometimes tuck up their mundus (Kerala dhoti) or lungis with the bottom of the garment being pulled up and tied back on to the waist. This would mean that the mundu (Kerala dhoti) or lungi only covers the body from the waist to the knees. In Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, only men wear this garment. It is also known as \\"Kaili\\" or \\"Saaram/Chaaram\\" in South Tamil Nadu. In Tamil Nadu Dhoti is considered as a traditional informal or casual wear and also preferred as a comfortable night wear. Lungis with checked pattern are more popular. A white-colored open cloth called vesti (dhoti) and is used in formal occasions. It is common in Konkan side of Karnataka state. Mostly used by Nawayath people who hails from Bhatkal Almost all of them wears it as their daily attire. It is as a mark of their tradition in Bhatkal. Mostly you will find them sewn like cylindrical shape. In Punjab, lungis are worn by both men and women. The male lungi is also called a tehmat,Development: A Saga of Two Worlds: Vismambhor Nath 2002 (Ashok Mukar Mittal Publishers)Lahore: A Sentimental Journey Pran Neville Penguin Books while the female lungi is called a laacha. They are part of traditional dance attire in Bhangra dance groups, but are also popular in rural areas as home wear. They are generally tied in a different way than in other parts of India and are, as a rule, unstitched and very colourful. Wearing the lungi has declined in the Punjab region in recent years.Alop Ho Reha Punjabi Virsa Harkesh Singh Kehal Rice farmer in Odisha wearing Lungi in tucked-up In Odisha, and West Bengal the lungi is primarily worn at home by males of all classes of society. Hindu men generally avoid wearing lungis on the street. In Odisha, Sambalpuri with the Sambalpuri pattern and mule based lungis from Khordha are available in addition to normal cotton fabric lungis. In Bihar and Haryana the lungi is considered a night garment for men. In Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh the lungi is worn often by Tribals. They have shifted to this from their previous dress of a small cloth around their waist. = Sultanate of Oman = In the Sultanate of Oman the garment is referred to as a \\"wizar\\" it is worn in all regions by men and is recognized as an undergarment to the traditional Omani \\"dishdasha\\". It is wrapped around the waist quite differently to the Indian style as it is folded left then right to make a straight seam in the middle. The wizar is usually white (north of country)with a colourful border of different colors. The wizar can be worn as an in house garment as most Omani's simply remove their dishdasha when at home and relax in their \\"wizars\\" and vests. In the South of Oman in the region of Dhofar it's common to see a colorful varieant of the wizar and is worn more openly outdoors than it is in the north. = Bangladesh = Boatman in Bangladesh wearing a Lungi The lungi ( , ) is the most commonly seen dress of Bangladeshi men, although it is not normally worn for formal occasions. In Bangladesh, lungis are worn by men, almost universally indoors, but commonly outdoors as well. Elaborately designed tartan cotton, batik, or silk lungis are often presented as wedding gifts to the groom in a Bangladeshi wedding. The typical Bangladeshi lungi is a seamless tubular shape, as opposed to the single sheet worn in other parts of South and Southeast Asia. In Bangladesh, the lungi industry is concentrated in Sirajganj, Kushtia, Pabna and Khulna. Bangladeshi women do not traditionally wear lungis, although non-Bengali tribal women do wear similar garments in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. In April 2013, the Baridhara Housing Society‚Äîa housing society in Dhaka‚Äîbanned lungi, and began refusing entry to those who wore them. Many opposed the ban, however, taking to social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to criticize the decision. A march took place on 13 April to oppose the ban. U.S Ambassador Dan Mozena has been seen wearing a lungi in front of his house. =Myanmar= In Myanmar, it is spelt longyi. For men, the longyi is known as a paso (Burmese: ·Äï·ÄØ·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏), and for women, it is known as a htamein (Burmese: ·Äë·Äò·ÄÆ). Longyis of different fabrics, including cotton and silk, are worn for both informal and formal occasions. =Thailand= In Thailand, it is known as a \\"pa kao mah\\" (Thai: ‡∏ú‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏°‡πâ‡∏≤) for men and a \\"pa toong\\" (Thai: ‡∏ú‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ñ‡∏∏‡∏á) for women. = Maldives = In The Maldives, it is known as \\"Mundu\\".

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 16, 2004. Plot Homer and Marge take the kids to get their shots. Just before Dr. Hibbert is about to inject Bart, he escapes. After a chase through town, Hibbert finally outsmarts Bart, by having Barney wear a latex mask, and finally injects him. The shot, however, causes Bart's earholes to swell shut, making him temporarily deaf. Hibbert also tricks Homer into signing a malpractice waiver. Marge wanted Bart to stay home; however, Bart wants to play in the donkey basketball game. While at the Springfield Elementary School donkey basketball game, Bart taunts a donkey with a carrot, unaware that the school is reciting the national anthem. After he places the carrot in his shorts, the donkey takes it and rips off Bart's shorts. While Bart is bent over to keep his privates covered with his shirt, the US flag is put up behind him and a photo is taken, which results in the crowd assuming that Bart is mooning the US flag. Shortly afterwards, the Springfield Shopper takes the story and completely turns it around, making it seem as if Bart had deliberately mooned the flag. Marge tries to tell Skinner that Bart was deaf at the time; however, because of Bart's history of similar pranks, Skinner does not believe it, a nod to The Boy Who Cried Wolf. He and his family soon are hated by all of Springfield. The Simpsons are later asked to appear on a talk show and tell their side of the story. Homer advises Marge to not take it too far. However, the host asks, instead, \\"What part of America do you hate most?\\" (an example of the fallacy of many questions). Marge says that, if by Americans you mean loud mouth talkshow hosts which everyone seems to be, then yes she DOES hate the Americans. She also said that she is well liked in Springfield, prompting the host to say that Springfield hates the US. The US then turns their back on Springfield (though there is widespread celebration in praise of Springfield in the Middle East), so Mayor Quimby frantically decides to change the name of Springfield to \\"Liberty-ville.\\" Everything in town is quickly patriotized; the traffic light colors are changed to red, white, and blue, and everything costs $17.76. While at church, Lisa speaks her opinion about patriotism, and the Simpsons are taken into custody, in violation of the \\"Government Knows Best Act.\\" The Simpsons are taken to the \\"Ronald Reagan Re-education Center\\", which houses Michael Moore, the Dixie Chicks, Elmo, Al Franken, and Bill Clinton, as well as a man who moans \\"My only crime was driving a van full of explosives in from Canada!\\". Marge feels bad that she took it too far after Homer warned her not to. With some help from the last-registered Democrat, the Simpsons escape the prison (in a parody of the escape scene from The Blues Brothers), but realize that the re- education center is actually Alcatraz Prison. While they are swimming to land (choosing to swim to Oakland instead of San Francisco because they \\"aren't made of money\\"), they are picked up by a French freighter and are brought to France. They are well adjusted, but still miss the United States, mainly because it is where all their stuff is. They then move back to the US dressed as 19th century immigrants from Europe where Homer speaks of plans of integration into the United States.

It is the most northerly port on the west coast of Scotland. Geography Sandwood Bay, a scenic beach, is about a drive or a walk north of Kinlochbervie. Other scenic areas close to the village include Oldshoremore Beach and Rhiconich. Fishing The majority of local industry is based upon fishing. Although the fleet of ships actually based in Kinlochbervie is rather small, many ships from the east coast of Scotland land their catches in Kinlochbervie. The dominant feature of the town is the large fish handling depot. From here catches are loaded onto large refrigerated lorries for transport by road throughout Europe. The importance of this link to the outside world to the local economy means that Kinlochbervie has surprisingly good road links, given its remote location and rugged local geography. Tourism The local scenery is a tourist attraction and is also an important part of the local economy. There are many holiday homes and small bed and breakfast businesses in the area. The largest in the village is Kinlochbervie Hotel. Time Team excavation On Sunday 20 January 2002 the first airing of Time Teams excavation of the area began. Divers from the programme's team went to explore the waters off the coast of Kinlochbervie, about below the sea‚Äôs surface after a shipwreck and artefacts were discovered by divers from RAF Lossiemouth. The artefacts found included two anchors, five iron canons and Spanish pottery from the 16th century. The site was designated as a Historic Maritime Protected Area in 2013. Sporting achievements The village also has a rather successful amateur football team, which competes in the local amateur league along with Durness, Tongue, Bettyhill, Lochinver and Melvich. In 2005 they won the league trophy, the prestigious Stafford Cup, for the first time in many years. The team also won The Guy Cup in the same year by winning a tournament of local teams. This was the first time a team west of the Kyle of Tongue had won it. The sport of shinty has recently been resurrected in Kinlochbervie by the local school, shinty was once played across North Sutherland until the 20th century but never competitively. Kinlochbervie Camanachd Club now compete at junior level against teams from across the Highlands. Cultural references The village features prominently in Irish writer Brian Friel's play Faith Healer. Sailor Frank Dye started his journey to Iceland in a small Wayfarer dinghy from the village in 1963. Inhabitants of Kinlochbervie are sometimes collectively referred to as \\"Greeks\\" by the residents of surrounding villages, for reasons now largely unknown. The village itself is sometimes referred to as \\"KLB\\". The most common surname in the area is \\"Morrison\\".

Pure modules are complementary to flat modules and generalize Pr√ºfer's notion of pure subgroups. While flat modules are those modules which leave short exact sequences exact after tensoring, a pure submodule defines a short exact sequence that remains exact after tensoring with any module. Similarly a flat module is a direct limit of projective modules, and a pure submodule defines a short exact sequence which is a direct limit of split exact sequences, each defined by a direct summand. Definition Let R be a ring (associative, with 1), and let M, P be modules over R. If i: P ‚Üí M is injective then P is a pure submodule of M if, for any R-module X, the natural induced map on tensor products i‚äóidX:P‚äóX ‚Üí M‚äóX is injective. Analogously, a short exact sequence :0 \\\\longrightarrow A \\\\stackrel{f}{\\\\longrightarrow} B \\\\stackrel{g}{\\\\longrightarrow} C \\\\longrightarrow 0 of R-modules is pure exact if the sequence stays exact when tensored with any R-module X. This is equivalent to saying that f(A) is a pure submodule of B. Purity can also be expressed element-wise; it is really a statement about the solvability of certain systems of linear equations. Specifically, P is pure in M if and only if the following condition holds: for any m-by-n matrix (aij) with entries in R, and any set y1,...,ym of elements of P, if there exist elements x1,...,xn in M such that :\\\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_j = y_i \\\\qquad\\\\mbox{ for } i=1,\\\\ldots,m then there also exist elements x1',..., xn' in P such that :\\\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x'_j = y_i \\\\qquad\\\\mbox{ for } i=1,\\\\ldots,m Examples * Every direct summand of M is pure in M. Consequently, every subspace of a vector space over a field is pure. * Suppose :0 \\\\longrightarrow A \\\\stackrel{f}{\\\\longrightarrow} B \\\\stackrel{g}{\\\\longrightarrow} C \\\\longrightarrow 0 is a short exact sequence of R modules, then: # C is a flat module if and only if the exact sequence is pure exact for every A and B. From this we can deduce that over a von Neumann regular ring, every submodule of every R-module is pure. This is because every module over a von Neumann regular ring is flat.

In addition to acid records imported from the US, the style was influenced by sources such as hardcore, German trance, and Belgian rave music. History Early exponents of the style included Richie Hawtin (aka Plastikman), Aphex Twin, and Dave Clarke, Hardfloor, solarquest, Damon Wilde. Other mainstays included London acts such as Liberators, Henry Cullen (aka D.A.V.E. The Drummer), Guy McAffer (aka The Geezer), and DDR.

Holland's RIASEC hexagon of The Holland Codes, graphed as a hexagon, shows that it is a circumplex that can be mapped onto two underlying dimensions. The Holland Codes or the Holland Occupational Themes (RIASEC) refers to a theory of careers and vocational choice (based upon personality types) that was initially developed by American psychologist John L. Holland.\\"The Development, Evolution, and Status of Holland's Theory of Vocational Personalities: Reflections and Future Directions for Counseling Psychology.\\" Journal of Counseling Psychology, Vol 57(1), 2010, 11‚Äì22. The Holland Codes serve as a component of the interests assessment, the Strong Interest Inventory. In addition, the US Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration has been using an updated and expanded version of the RIASEC model in the \\"Interests\\" section of its free online database O*NET (Occupational Information Network) since its inception during the late 1990s. Overview Holland's theories of vocational choice, The Holland Occupational Themes, \\"now pervades career counseling research and practice\\". Its origins \\"can be traced to an article in the Journal of Applied Psychology in 1958 and a subsequent article in 1959 that set out his theory of vocational choices. ... The basic premise was that one's occupational preferences were in a sense a veiled expression of underlying character.\\"Athanasou, James. \\"Obituary: John L. Holland 1919‚Äì2008\\" Australian Journal of Career Development, September 22, 2009. The 1959 article in particular (\\"A Theory of Vocational Choice,\\" published in the Journal of Counseling Psychology) is considered the first major introduction of Holland's \\"theory of vocational personalities and work environments\\". Holland originally labeled his six types as \\"motoric, intellectual, esthetic, supportive, persuasive, and conforming\\". He later developed and changed them to: \\"Realistic (Doers), Investigative (Thinkers), Artistic (Creators), Social (Helpers), Enterprising (Persuaders), and Conventional (Organizers)\\". Holland's six categories show some correlation with each other. It is called the RIASEC model or the hexagonal model because the initial letter of the region is equal to R-I-A-S-E-C when it is expressed as a circle connecting the regions of high correlation. Professor John Johnson of Penn State suggested that an alternative way of categorizing the six types would be through ancient social roles: \\"hunters (Realistic), shamans (Investigative), artisans (Artistic), healers (Social), leaders (Enterprising), and lorekeepers (Conventional)\\". According to the Committee on Scientific Awards, Holland's \\"research shows that personalities seek out and flourish in career environments they fit and that jobs and career environments are classifiable by the personalities that flourish in them\\".\\"Award for distinguished scientific applications of psychology: John L. Holland\\". American Psychologist, Vol 63(8), Nov 2008, 672‚Äì674. Holland also wrote of his theory that \\"the choice of a vocation is an expression of personality\\".Holland, John. Making Vocational Choices: A Theory of Careers. (Prentice-Hall, 1973). Furthermore, while Holland suggested that people can be \\"categorized as one of six types\\", he also argued that \\"a six-category scheme built on the assumption that there are only six kinds of people in the world is unacceptable on the strength of common sense alone. But a six category scheme that allows a simple ordering of a person's resemblance to each of the six models provides the possibility of 720 different personality patterns.\\"  Related model  = Prediger's two-dimensional model = Prediger constructed the scale of \\"work task\\" and \\"work relevant abilities\\" based on Holland's model, and carried out factor analysis and multidimensional scale analysis to clarify the basic structure. As a result, two axes of Data/Ideas and Things/People were extracted. Although Prediger's inquiry did not start from interest per se, it eventually led to the birth of models other than RIASEC, suggesting that the structure of occupational interest may provide a basic dimension. = Tracey and Rounds's octagonal model = In the United States, the energetic trial is being made with the aim of the new model which surpasses Holland hexagon model in 1990's. Tracey & Rounds's octagonal model is one such example. Based on the empirical data, they argue that occupational interests can be placed circularly in a two-dimensional plane consisting of People/Things and Data/ldeas axes, and the number of regions can be arbitrarily determined. According to their model, only Holland's hexagonal model does not adequately represent the structure of occupational interest, and it is possible to retain validity as an octagonal or 16 square model if necessary. Tracey, Watanabe, & Schneider conducted an international comparative study of job interests among Japanese and U.S. university students, and the results suggest that the Tracey & Rounds's octagonal model is more fitted to Japanese students than Holland's hexagonal model. = Tracey and Rounds's spherical model = Tracey & Rounds criticizes that the conventional models of occupational interest structure do not correctly depict the positional relationship of occupations because they neglect occupational prestige, i.e., \\"social prestige\\" or \\"high socioeconomic status\\" and proposes a spherical model that assigns occupations to a 3-dimensional space incorporating occupational prestige. In this model, 18 regions of interest are displayed on a spherical space. The left hemisphere has a high status area, with Health Sciences at the top. The right hemisphere has a low status area, with Service Provision as the lowest ground. Though this model is excellent in the point of more accurately describing the relation between various occupations, it makes the occupation interest structure more complicated, and there is a weak point that it is difficult to be adapted to the data except for U.S.A.

He was one of the earliest leaders of the Hawaii Republican Party.  Life  Alexander & Baldwin, one of the \\"Big Five\\" corporations that dominated Hawaii economics in the early twentieth century, was started by his father Henry Perrine Baldwin and uncle Samuel Thomas Alexander in 1869. His father was son of early missionary Dwight Baldwin, and his mother Emily Whitney Alexander was daughter of early missionary William P. Alexander. Born January 12, 1871 on the Baldwin house at the Paliuli sugar mill in the Kingdom of Hawaii on the island of Maui, between the towns of PƒÅia and Makawao, Hawaii. Baldwin was educated in Honolulu at Punahou School. His parents sent him to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts from which he graduated in 1889. In 1894, Baldwin obtained a degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a member of the Chi Phi Fraternity. He returned to work for his father and uncle on the Haiku sugarcane plantation. From 1897 to 1904 he became manager. Sugarcane production became very profitable with increasing trade with the United States and annexation of Hawaii in 1898. Haiku merged with the PƒÅia plantation, and he became president of the combined operation called the Maui Agricultural Company. He served as president of Maui Telephone Company, and Maui Publishing Company. He was a director of Baldwin Bank, which later became part of First Hawaiian Bank. In 1916, during World War I, he served as colonel of the 3rd Regiment of the Hawaii National Guard. On July 19, 1897 he married Ethel Frances Smith (1879‚Äì1967), daughter of lawyer William Owen Smith in Honolulu ‚Äî his younger brother Samuel would later marry sister Katherine Smith. They had one daughter, Frances Hobron (1904‚Äì1996) who married J. Walter Cameron (1895‚Äì1976), manager of the Pineapple plantation in Honolua. Cameron's company Maui Pineapple Company merged with Baldwin's pineapple business to become the Maui Land & Pineapple Company. The Camerons' son Colin Cameron founded the Kapalua Bay Hotel & Villas resort. The pineapple business continued until 2009.  Politics  Baldwin became county chairman for the Hawaii Republican Party in 1912. He entered local politics in 1913 when he was elected to the Hawaii Territorial Senate. He was territorial senator until 1921 when he was called to higher office to fulfill the unexpired term of Prince Jonah K≈´hi≈ç Kalanianaole in Washington, D.C. who had died. Baldwin was elected to fill the vacancy for Congressional Delegate from March 25, 1922 to March 3, 1923. Despite pleas to continue service, he retired from politics and returned to his private business ventures. Baldwin emerged from retirement to serve in the Hawaii Territorial House of Representatives in 1933. Following a single term, Baldwin returned to the upper chamber where he became territory senate president in 1937. He died at PƒÅia, Maui on October 8, 1946 and was buried in Makawao Cemetery.Biographical Directory of the American Congress Legacy A beach park near PƒÅia, originally a company recreation facility, is named for him at .

The group were primarily influenced by traditional Irish language songs from Donegal and have sold over a million records. The group were the first traditional Irish group to be signed to a major label when they signed with Virgin Records in 1994. The group has collaborated with Dolly Parton, Enya, The Chieftains, Bonnie Raitt, Alison Krauss, and many others.  Origin  As an 18-year-old young student and musician from Belfast, Frankie Kennedy used to travel to Gweedore, County Donegal on his summer holidays, learning Irish and playing traditional Irish music on Irish flute and tin whistle. There he met native 14-year-old Irish-speaker and musician Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh, the daughter of musician Proinsias √ì Maonaigh from Gweedore and the two fell in love with each other but N√≠ Mhaonaigh being very young, an innocent friendship began. When she was 15, she was allowed to go to dances under her brother Gear√≥id √ì Maonaigh's watchful eye, and gradually Frankie Kennedy and Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh became a couple. They both took jobs as trainee teachers at St. Patrick's College in Dublin. In 1979, the two musicians made their recording debut as accompanists for the well-known Belfast singer and Gaelic enthusiast Albert Fry on his self-titled debut album. (In total, N√≠ Mhaonaigh and Kennedy would feature on the first three albums of Albert Fry.) Two years later, in 1981, N√≠ Mhaonaigh and Kennedy graduated from college and married when Mair√©ad was 21. History = Pre-Altan years: N√≠ Mhaonaigh & Kennedy = Kennedy and N√≠ Mhaonaigh had moved to Dublin and were both teaching at St. Oliver Plunkett primary school in Malahide. At the time, they were also playing music in the folk clubs around Dublin. N√≠ Mhaonaigh had learned the Donegal style of fiddle-playing from her father, however, Donegal music was little known outside of the county at the time. Kennedy's repertoire included a number of obscure northern flute tunes drawn from his travels in County Tyrone and County Fermanagh. In the early 1980s, N√≠ Mhaonaigh formed a (short-lived) band with Kennedy, Gear√≥id √ì Maonaigh (Mair√©ad's brother) and a then unknown musician from Gweedore, Eithne N√≠ Bhraon√°in, later known as Enya. People became interested in their repertoire of Donegal tunes. The group's members contributed to Mair√©ad and Frankie's debut album, Ceol Aduaidh (which means \\"Music of the North\\"), produced by Nicky Ryan and released in 1983 by Gael- Linn Records. The album is a collection of Gaelic songs and Ulster jigs and reels. After the release of their first album, Kennedy and N√≠ Mhaonaigh were invited to America, and they quickly realised there was a market there. They then took a career break from teaching, which ultimately became permanent. The two started to tour with two additional members Ciar√°n Curran (on bouzouki) and Mark Kelly (on guitar), performing their first ever live concert as a four-member ensemble on 1 June 1985 at St. John's Church in Listowel, County Kerry, Ireland, this line-up ‚Äì with no name yet ‚Äì being the core of the future Altan band. Inspired by the success of their debut effort, they began to work on a new group of ballads and jigs from the North. The result was the album Altan, released in 1987 on the Green Linnet Records label, named after a lake which sits in the shadow of Errigal near Gweedore, County Donegal. In the Irish language, altan also means \\"stream\\". The album features many of the musicians who would later join the band. = 1987‚Äì1994: Horse with a Heart, The Red Crow, Harvest Storm, Island Angel = Shortly after the release in 1987 of Altan, their second studio album, N√≠ Mhaonaigh and Kennedy named their ensemble \\"Altan\\" after the name of the album, the band's line-up remaining unchanged as a quartet including Kennedy on flute, N√≠ Mhaonaigh on fiddle and vocals, Ciar√°n Curran on bouzouki and Mark Kelly on guitar. Later on, Dublin's Paul O'Shaughnessy joined the band on fiddle, participating in the first three Green Linnet recordings (1989‚Äì1992). In 1989, Altan released their debut album, Horse with a Heart. In 1990, Altan released The Red Crow, which became the first of three Altan albums to win the \\"Celtic/British Isles Album of the Year\\" award from the National Association of Independent Record Distributors and Manufactures (NAIRD). In 1992, Ciar√°n Tourish on fiddle & whistle and D√°ith√≠ Sproule on guitar joined the band for the Harvest Storm recording. With the arrival of D√°ith√≠ Sproule, Mark and D√°ith√≠ shared the role of guitarist, Mark touring with the band in Europe and D√°ith√≠ in the United States. In June 1992, Frankie Kennedy learned he had Ewing's sarcoma, a type of cancer that attacks bone structure. He endured surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy simultaneously continuing his work with Altan. In 1993, the band released Island Angel. Billboard cited Island Angel as the fourth-best-selling album of world music in 1994. In 1994, they were asked by US President Bill Clinton to perform at the White House on Saint Patrick's Day, and they played for him again on his visit to Ireland in 1998. Also, President of Ireland Mary McAleese requested they accompany her on several State visits. = 1994‚Äì2000: Kennedy's death, major label, Blackwater, Runaway Sunday = While battling with cancer, Frankie Kennedy continued to steer the band to international recognition, negotiating with Virgin Records UK to sign the band. Frankie Kennedy died on 19 September 1994. After a period of mourning, the band resumed their touring as requested by Kennedy himself before he died. They became the first traditional group to be signed to a major label when they signed with Virgin Records. Dermot Byrne, who had previously guested on accordion on two Altan recordings The Red Crow (1990) and Island Angel (1993), officially joined the band in 1994. The recording line-up became Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh (vocals, fiddle), Ciar√°n Tourish (fiddle), Mark Kelly (guitar), Ciar√°n Curran (bouzouki), D√°ith√≠ Sproule (guitar) and Dermot Byrne (accordion) and remained unchanged until Dermot Byrne's departure in 2013. In 1995, Green Linnet Records released Altan's first greatest-hits package titled The First Ten Years. In April 1996, Altan released Blackwater, their first album on Virgin Records. In July 1997, Altan released their next album, Runaway Sunday, which featured their version of \\"Gleannt√°in Ghlas' Ghaoth Dobhair\\", a song written by Mair√©ad's father and a favourite at all their live shows. = 2000‚Äì2009: Another Sky, The Blue Idol, hiatus = In 2000, the group released Another Sky, their first album on the Narada label. In 2002, The Blue Idol featured the vocals of American singer Dolly Parton, who became close friends with the group after she invited them to play on her 2001 album Little Sparrow. The album garnered them the award for Best Group at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. In 2002, Altan, along with other artists signed to Green Linnet such as Cherish the Ladies, sued for unpaid royalties. Most artists were paid and most claims were settled in 2006 as Compass Records (who would later sign Altan) bought the company. In 2003, they released another greatest hits compilation CD called The Best of Altan: The Songs. In 2005, they released Local Ground which met with positive reviews. Altan then went on hiatus. Some members released their debut solo album: Ciar√°n Tourish released Down The Line (2005), D√°ith√≠ Sproule released The Crow in the Sun (2007) and Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh released Imeall (2009). = 2009‚Äì2011: 25th anniversary = In April 2009, Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh announced that the band would be going into the studio in early May 2009 to record a new Altan album with the RT√â Concert Orchestra just after a show on 7 May 2009 in Pornichet, France (near Saint- Nazaire).} In July 2009, N√≠ Mhaonaigh announced that Altan would also release their first DVD as the video recording of a concert on 14 August 2009 in the National Concert Hall (NCH), Dublin, Ireland (again with the RT√â Concert Orchestra). To commemorate their 25th anniversary, Altan released 25th Anniversary Celebration, a compilation album of studio re-recordings of previous material (plus one brand new song) with the contribution of the RT√â Concert Orchestra. It was made available in January 2010 in Japan (where it had its launch in December 2009 during Altan's Winter 2009/2010 Japanese tour), in February 2010 in Ireland and UK and in March 2010 in North America. After a few European dates in January, February and April 2010 and an extensive 18-date (March to April) tour of the United States, Altan launched on 23 April 2010 in Dublin, Ireland their 14-date \\"25th Anniversary\\" tour of Ireland which would run from April to June. During Summer 2010, Altan took part in a few European festivals. A 10-date tour of UK and Ireland took place in September 2010. = 2011‚Äì2014: Gleann Nimhe ‚Äì The Poison Glen and touring = Altan in concert in Plouescat, France in 2013 From April 2011 to January 2012, Altan recorded a new studio album titled Gleann Nimhe ‚Äì The Poison Glen. After celebrating the launch of the 18th Frankie Kennedy Winter School programme on 29 November 2011 by performing a show taking place during the Liffey Banks Sessions at The Grand Social, Dublin, Ireland, Altan celebrated the New Year 2012, then forthcoming release of their new studio album Gleann Nimhe ‚Äì The Poison Glen on the occasion of their performance on 1 January 2012 at Scoil Gheimhridh Frankie Kennedy, Ionad Cois Locha, Gweedore, County Donegal, Ireland during which they played some new tracks from it. Lead singer Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh is known for performances of Irish Gaelic songs Exactly seven years after Local Ground, Altan released Gleann Nimhe ‚Äì The Poison Glen, their new studio album of original material, on Compass Records in the US on 28 February 2012, in Europe & Australia on 8 March 2012, in Ireland on 9 March 2012 and in the UK on 12 March 2012. Started in April 2011, the recording took place in famous sound engineer & bass player Billy Robinson's Steeples Studios in Ramelton, Ireland and ended in early January 2012. The album features An Gheal√≥g, a song composed by Martin Tourish who would later join the band replacing Dermot Byrne, temporarily starting from the Fall 2013 (mostly) German tour and permanently since Dermot Byrne's departure from the band in early 2014. = 2014-2017: The Widening Gyre and touring = ;2014 On 3 June 2014, on their Twitter page and the Pledge Music website, Altan announced that they were working on a new studio album to be recorded in Nashville, Tennessee. The band had started rehearsing potential material for the album with the intention to perform some of these new pieces at various concerts over the summer. While on a 5-show US tour, the band ‚Äì Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh, Ciar√°n Tourish, Ciar√°n Curran, Da√≠th√≠ Sproule, Mark Kelly and Martin Tourish (replacing Dermot Byrne) ‚Äì began recording their new album in Nashville, Tennessee. In October 2014, Altan confirmed that their new album was being mixed, and that they \\"hope[d] to have it [released] in the Spring of 2015,\\" and that it would contain \\"loads of surprises\\". On 5 November 2014, Altan published a snippet of a new track titled \\"White Birds\\" which was recorded with an undisclosed musical guest. In late November 2014, Altan announced the names of some guest musicians who they collaborated with: Eddi Reader on vocals, Jerry Douglas (from Union Station and Transatlantic Sessions) on Dobro, Alison Brown, Bruce Molsky, Mike McGoldrick, Natalie Haas, Jim Higgins and Darol Anger. On 5 December 2014, Altan took part in the Great British Folk Festival in Skegness, Lincolnshire, UK. During the show, Ciar√°n Tourish announced that they \\"have a new album almost finished [which] has been mastered\\" and about which they \\"can do any more with it [for] it's done\\" just before the band went into playing a new medley (taken from it) entitled \\"The Tin Key / Sam Kelly's Jig / The Gravediggers\\". On 19 December 2014, Altan revealed the names of the final guests having participated in the recording of the new album: Mary Chapin Carpenter, Todd Phillips, Garry West, Julee Glaub Weems, Kenny Malone and Stuart Duncan and offered (for listening and downloading) a (very) short audio excerpt (18 seconds) of one new instrumental titled \\"Buffalo Gals\\". ;2015 In January 2015, Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh explained why Altan called on Pledge Music's services in order to produce the new studio album and thanked all the pledgers for helping Altan with the fundraising campaign and for bringing it to completion (reaching, at that time, 101% of goal): \\"The music business is a changing world for professional musicians as ourselves. We depend more on live concerts to make our living. We can no longer depend on big record company funding to get our music out there, we have to do it ourselves. Now with your help we have funded our latest album which we are really happy with.\\" She also stated that Altan have licensed the new album to Compass Records in the US, that Gary West of Compass co-produced it and that after 30 years recording studio albums, Altan \\"have taken a new approach with this one.\\" The Altan Pledge Music pre-order page announced that all exclusive pre-orders would be fulfilled by 17 February 2015. The band later announced that the new album would be released in Ireland on 20 February 2015, in the UK on 23 February 2015 and in the US on 24 February 2015, and would be titled The Widening Gyre, taken from \\"The Second Coming\\", a poem by W. B. Yeats, the first Irishman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1923. Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh revealed the album's cover artwork, by artist friend √âda√≠n O'Donnell, who previously designed the Gleann Nimhe ‚Äì The Poison Glen cover. On 26 January 2015, Altan's official website published a presentation of their new studio album entitled anew The Widening Gyre giving many details about the new album: the new musical direction taken by the band, the album recording process and the participation of numerous guest musicians as well as the titles of some of the new tracks. The very same day, on their \\"Widening Gyre\\" iTunes page, Altan revealed the titles of the 14 tracks from their new studio album and released them for sale. On 27 January 2015, on their \\"Widening Gyre\\" Compass Records page, Altan made available short snippets of their new tracks. On 22 February 2015 in Charleston, WV (at Culture Center Theater, Mountain Stage Radio), Altan embarked on an extensive 25-date Winter/Spring North American tour which ended on 3 April 2015 in Greeley, Colorado (at the Union Colony Civic Center) visiting the Canada only twice: on 18 March 2015 in St. Albert, Alberta (at the Arden Theatre) and on 19 March 2015 in North Vancouver, BC (at the Centennial Theatre Centre). ;2016 Almost a year after the beginning of their extensive 25-date Winter/Spring 2015 North American tour, Altan embarked on 19 February 2016 in Northampton, Massachusetts in another extensive North American tour (but exclusively visiting the US), their 25-date Winter/Spring 2016 US tour which ended on 25 March 2016 in Spokane, Washington. An extensive (18-date) Spring 2016 UK tour followed in April and May 2016, including one Scotland leg and two England legs from 8 April in Hindhead, Surrey to 7 May 2016 in Stornoway, Scotland, including a London show at Kings Place on 9 April 2016. ;2017 Altan in Hamburg 2017 Altan celebrated their 30th anniversary year with a Winter tour of Europe in January 2017, visiting The Netherlands, Ireland, Scotland and France within this month. On this tour, the core of the band (made of Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh, Ciar√°n Curran, Ciar√°n Tourish, Mark Kelly, Martin Tourish) is joined with a newcomer, John Joe Kelly on bodhr√°n. Altan have also announced for 2017 a 17-date US Winter tour in February and March 2017. After more than 25 years as a band member (he'd joined Altan in September 1991 for the Harvest Storm recording sessions), Ciar√°n Tourish (fiddle, backing vocals) left the band (for personal reasons) after the show Altan performed on 29 July 2017 in Lyon, France at Les Nuits de Fourvi√®re Festival. He was not replaced. = 2017-present: The Gap Of Dreams and touring = Altan in Hamburg 2019 On 23 February 2018, Altan embarked on a new (one-month) North-American tour. On 2 March 2018, Altan released their new studio album entitled The Gap Of Dreams which they had recorded in November 2017. On 15 March 2020, Altan announced that their on-going US Spring Tour 2020 had come to a halt because of the coronavirus situation and that they had got advice to return to Ireland as soon as possible. Altan's booking agency is due to reschedule all the 9 remaining (15‚Äì29 March 2020) concerts for the coming Autumn 2020 or next Spring 2021. Nevertheless, Altan's bus tour with Hammond Tours scheduled for 12‚Äì19 September 2020 should go ahead.Altan's Facebook page > Post \\"T√° br√≥n orainn\\" on 15 March 2020Spring Tour Cancelled (T√° br√≥n orainn) (15 March 2020)  Band members  = Recording line-up = Since the arrival of accordionist Dermot Byrne in 1994, the band recording line-up has remained unchanged until his definitive departure from the band some time in 2013 and his lasting replacement since then by Martin Tourish (Ciar√°n Tourish's cousin).

Air enters from upper right, and pure air follows the curved ramp down to the compressor inlet (also covered by a screen). Any debris being sucked in will have enough momentum that it will not make such a sharp bend, and will hit the screen on the upper left, and will be carried out to the left, getting blown overboard. Potential foreign object debris (in this case, a Scops owl) found in the wheel well of an F/A-18 Hornet on a US aircraft carrier In aviation and aerospace, foreign object damage (FOD) is any article or substance, alien to an aircraft or system, which could potentially cause damage. External FOD hazards include bird strikes, hail, ice, sandstorms, ash-clouds or objects left on the runway. Internal FOD hazards include items left in the cockpit that interfere with flight safety by getting tangled in control cables, jam moving parts or short-out electrical connections. The term FOD is used to describe both the foreign objects themselves, and any damage attributed to them. Examples FOD can be internal or external.According to the National Aerospace Standard 412, maintained by the National Association of FOD Prevention, Inc. The \\"Damage\\" term was prevalent in military circles, but has since been pre-empted by a definition of FOD that looks at the \\"debris\\". This shift was made \\"official\\" in the latest FAA Advisory Circulars FAA A/C 150/5220-24 'Airport Foreign Object Debris (FOD) Detection Equipment' (2009) and FAA A/C 150/5210-24 'Airport Foreign Object Debris (FOD) Management'. Eurocontrol, ECAC, and the ICAO have all rallied behind this new definition. As Iain McCreary of Insight SRI put it in a presentation to NAFPI (August 2010), \\"You can have debris present without damage, but never damage without debris.\\" Likewise, FOD prevention systems work by sensing and detecting not the damage but the actual debris. Thus FOD is now taken to mean the debris itself, and the resulting damage is referred to as \\"FOD damage\\". Internal FOD is damage or hazards caused by foreign objects inside the aircraft. For example, cockpit FOD is a situation where an item gets loose in the cockpit and jams or restricts the operation of the controls. Tool FOD is a serious hazard caused by tools left inside the aircraft after manufacturing or servicing. Tools or other items can get tangled in control cables, jam moving parts, short out electrical connections, or otherwise interfere with safe flight. Aircraft maintenance teams usually have strict tool control procedures including toolbox inventories to make sure all tools have been removed from an aircraft before it is released for flight. Tools used during manufacturing are tagged with a serial number so if they are found they can be traced. Examples of FOD include: *Aircraft parts, rocks, broken pavement, ramp equipment. *Parts from ground vehicles *Garbage, maintenance tools, etc. mistakenly or purposely deposited on tarmac and/or runway surfaces. *Hail: can break windshields and damage or stop engines. *Ice on the wings, propellers, or engine intakes *Bird collisions with engines or other sensitive parts of the aircraft. *Dust or ash clogging the air intakes (as in sandstorms in desert operating conditions or ash clouds in volcanic eruptions). For helicopters, this is also a major problem during a brownout. *Tools, bolts, metal shavings, lockwire, etc. mistakenly left behind inside aircraft during the manufacturing process or maintenance. All aircraft may occasionally lose small parts during takeoff and landing. These parts remain on the runway and can cause damage to tires of other aircraft, hit the fuselage or windshield/canopy, or get sucked up into an engine. Although airport ground crews regularly clean up runways, the crash of Air France Flight 4590 demonstrated that accidents can still occur: in that case, the crash was said to have been caused by debris left by a flight that had departed only four minutes earlier. USS John F. Kennedy (CV 67). On aircraft carriers, as well as military and some civilian airfields, sweeps are conducted before flight operations begin. A line of crewmen walk shoulder to shoulder along the flight operations surfaces, searching for and removing any foreign objects. Jet engine design and FOD Modern jet engines can suffer major damage from even small objects being sucked into the engine. The FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) requires that all engine types pass a test which includes firing a fresh chicken (dead, but not frozen) into a running jet engine from a small cannon. The engine does not have to remain functional after the test, but it must not cause significant damage to the rest of the aircraft. Thus, if the bird strike causes it to \\"throw a blade\\" (break apart in a way where parts fly off at high speed), doing so must not cause loss of the aircraft. Engine and airframe designs which avoid FOD Some military aircraft had a unique design to prevent FOD from damaging the engine. The design included an S-shaped bend in the airflow, so that air entered the inlet, was bent back towards the front of the plane, and bent back again towards the back before entering the engine. At the back of the first bend a strong spring held a door shut. Any foreign object flying in the intake flew in, hit the door, opened it, flew through, and then exited the aircraft. Thus, only small objects swept up by the air could enter the engine. This design did indeed prevent FOD problems, but the constriction and drag induced by the bending of the airflow reduced the engine's effective power, and thus the design was not repeated. A similar approach is used on many turboshaft- powered helicopters, such as the Mi-24, which use a \\"vortex-type\\" or \\"centrifugal\\" intake, in which the air is forced to flow through a spiral path before entering the engine; the heavier dust and other debris are forced outwards, where it is separated from the airflow before it enters the engine inlet. The Russian Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 fighters have a special intake design to prevent ingestion of FOD during take-off from rough airfields. The main air intakes could be closed with mesh doors and special inlets on the top of the intakes temporarily opened. This would allow enough airflow to the engine for take-off but reduced the chances of the engine sucking up objects from the ground. Another interesting design to minimize the risk of FOD is the Antonov An-74 which has a very high placement of the engines. Boeing offered a gravel runway kit for early 737s that allows the plane to be used from unimproved and gravel runways, in spite of having very low-slung engines. This kit included gravel deflectors on the landing gear; foldaway lights on the bottom of the plane; and screens that prevented gravel, entering the open wheelwells when the gear was extended, from hitting critical components. It also included vortex dissipators, devices that would reduce the airflow into the engine from the bottom so as to reduce the likelihood of ingesting gravel. Airbus are investigating a novel approach to reducing FOD. By developing, in conjunction with Israel Aerospace Industries, the Taxibot, a tractor controlled by the pilot, aircraft will not need to use jet engines while taxiing, so will not be vulnerable to FOD on aprons or taxiways. FOD damage examples =Vehicle Tire Track-In= Debris is often trapped in the treads of tires from vehicles coming onto an airfield. Types of debris trapped in a vehicle tire can include rocks, mud, stones, loose hardware (screws, washers, bolts, ect) and many other forms of small materials. These can be crew & fuel trucks, maintenance vehicles and many others that inadvertently bring and deposit debris around a flight line. These types of FOD are very difficult to track and manage once they are introduced into the airfield. The debris can then easily be picked up by jet engine intake, engine blast and prop/rotor draft. This material, once loose around operational aircraft, can lead to serious safety concerns including personnel injury and equipment/property damage. It is amazing to think that the average FOD repair to an engine can exceed $1MM....all caused by a simple rock; outlined here Boeing FOD Prevention. =Runway debris= The crash of a Concorde, Air France Flight 4590, at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris on 25 July 2000 was caused by FOD; in this case a piece of titanium debris on the runway which had been part of a thrust reverser that had fallen from a Continental Airlines McDonnell Douglas DC-10 during takeoff about four minutes earlier. All 100 passengers and nine crew on board the flight, as well as four people on the ground, were killed. A Gates Learjet 36A, registration number N527PA, was taking off from Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport in Virginia on March 26, 2007, when the crew heard a loud \\"pop\\". Aborting the takeoff, the crew tried to control the \\"fishtailing\\" and activate the drogue parachute. The parachute did not work and the Learjet ran off the runway, its tires blown. Airport personnel reported seeing rocks and pieces of metal on the runway after the accident. The National Transportation Safety Board said that the accident was caused by FOD on the runway. Failure of the drogue parachute contributed to the accident. =Volcanic ash= On 24 June 1982, British Airways Flight 9 en route to Perth, Australia, flew into a volcanic ash cloud over the Indian Ocean. The Boeing 747-200B suffered engine surges in all four engines until they all failed. The passengers and crew could see a phenomenon known as St. Elmo's fire around the plane. Flight 9 dived down until it exited the cloud allowing the airborne ash to clear the engines, which were then restarted. The cockpit windshield was badly pitted by the ash particles but the aircraft landed safely. On 15 December 1989, KLM Flight 867, en route to Narita International Airport, Tokyo flew through a thick cloud of volcanic ash from Mount Redoubt, which had erupted the day before. The Boeing 747-400's four engines flamed out. After descending more than 14,000 feet, the crew restarted the engines and landed safely at Anchorage International Airport. =Item jettisoned from aircraft= An unusual case of FOD occurred on 28 September 1981 over Chesapeake Bay. During flight testing of an F/A-18 Hornet, the Naval Air Test Center of the United States Navy was using a Douglas TA-4J Skyhawk as a chase plane to film a jettison test of a bomb rack from the Hornet. The bomb rack struck the right wing of the Skyhawk, shearing off almost half the wing. The Skyhawk caught fire within seconds of being struck; the two persons on board ejected.List of ejections from aircraft in 1981. Retrieved: 30 August 2008.Page with link to WMV clip of destruction of TA-4J BuNo. 156896. Retrieved 30 August 2008. =Bird strikes= On 20 November 1975 a Hawker Siddeley HS.125 taking off at Dunsfold Aerodrome flew through a flock of northern lapwings immediately after lifting off the runway and lost power in both engines. The crew landed the aircraft back on the runway but it overran the end and crossed a road. The aircraft struck a car on the road, killing its six occupants. Although the aircraft was destroyed in the ensuing fire, the nine occupants of the aircraft survived the crash.AAIB Official Report of the investigation into the crash of HS.125-600B registration G-BCUX retrieved 2010-05-19. On 17 November 1980 a Hawker Siddeley Nimrod of the Royal Air Force crashed shortly after taking off from RAF Kinloss. It flew through a flock of Canada geese, causing three of its four engines to fail. The pilot and copilot were killed; the pilot was subsequently posthumously awarded an Air Force Cross for his actions in maintaining control of the aircraft and saving the lives of the 18 crew. The remains of 77 birds were found on or near the runway.Aviation Safety Network XV256 accident page retrieved 2008-01-23.\\"RAAF Exchange Pilot Valour Cited in RAF Accident Report\\", \\"Newsdesk - Military\\", Australian Aviation magazine No. 16, September 1982, p45.

The pilot ditched the aircraft in the Hudson River, saving the lives of all on board. Wildlife and wetlands near airports Significant problems occur with airports where the grounds were or have become nesting areas for birds. While fences can prevent a moose or deer from wandering onto a runway, birds are more difficult to control. Often airports employ a type of bird scarer that operates on propane to cause a noise loud enough to scare away any birds that might be in the vicinity. Airport managers use any means available (including trained falcons as well as robird flapping-wing falcon- like drones) to reduce bird populations. Another solution under investigation is the use of artificial turf near runways, since it does not offer food, shelter, or water to wildlife. =Conferences= In the United States, the most prominent gathering of FOD experts has been the annual National Aerospace FOD Prevention Conference. It is hosted in a different city each year by National Aerospace FOD Prevention, Inc. (NAFPI), a nonprofit association that focuses on FOD education, awareness and prevention. Conference information, including presentations from past conferences, is available at the NAFPI Web site. However, NAFPI has come under some critique as being focused on tool control and manufacturing processes, and other members of the industry have stepped forward to fill the gaps. BAA hosted the world's first airport-led conference on the subject in November 2010. Detection Technologies & FOD Prevention There is some debate regarding FOD detection systems as the costs can be high and the domain of responsibility is not clear. However, one airport claims that their FOD detection system may have paid for itself in a single incident where personnel were alerted to a steel cable on the runway, before a single aircraft was put at risk. The FAA has investigated FOD detection technologies, and has set standards for the following categories: *Radar *Electro-optical (visible band imagery (standard CCTV) and low light cameras) *Hybrid *RFID on metal *Manufactured FODS Mats - Track-Out Prevention & Track-In Control Chennault International Airport FODS Mats Damage tolerance improvements The negative effects from FOD can be reduced or entirely eliminated by introducing compressive residual stresses in critical fatigue areas into the part during the manufacturing process. These beneficial stresses are induced into the part through cold working the part with peening processes: shot peening, or laser peening. The deeper the compressive residual stress the more significant the fatigue life and damage tolerance improvement. Shot peening typically induces compressive stresses a few thousandths of an inch deep, laser peening typically imparts compressive residual stresses 0.040 to 0.100 inches deep. Laser peen induced compressive stresses are also more resistant to heat exposure. Technologies, information and training materials helpful in preventing FOD *Aerospace tool control systems *FOD prevention program manuals *Magnetic bars *Promotional and awareness materials *Tool and parts control/retrieval *Tow-behind friction sweeper *Tow-behind sweepers *Training materials *Vacuum truck sweepers *Walk-behind sweepers Economic impact Internationally, FOD costs the aviation industry US$13 billion per year in direct plus indirect costs. The indirect costs are as much as ten times the direct cost value, representing delays, aircraft changes, incurred fuel costs, unscheduled maintenance, and the like. and causes expensive, significant damage to aircraft and parts and death and injury to workers, pilots and passengers. It is estimated that FOD costs major airlines in the United States $26 per flight in aircraft repairs, plus $312 in such additional indirect costs as flight delays, plane changes and fuel inefficiencies. \\"There are other costs that are not as easy to calculate but are equally disturbing,\\" according to UK Royal Air Force Wing Commander and FOD researcher Richard Friend.Make It FOD Free website \\"From accidents such as the Air France Concorde, Flight AF 4590, there is the loss of life, suffering and effect on the families of those who died, the suspicion of malpractice, guilt, and blame that could last for lifetimes. This harrowing torment is incalculable but should not be forgotten, ever. If everyone kept this in mind, we would remain vigilant and forever prevent foreign object debris from causing a problem. In fact, many factors combine to cause a chain of events that can lead to a failure.\\" Studies There have only been two detailed studies of the economic cost of FOD for civil airline operations. The first was by Brad Bachtel of Boeing, who published a value of $4 billion USD per year. This top- down value was for several years the standard industry figure for the cost of FOD. The second work (2007) was by Iain McCreary from the consultancy Insight SRI Ltd. This more detailed report offered a first-cut of the cost of FOD, based on a bottom-up analysis of airline maintenance log records. Here, data was broken into per flight direct costs and per flight indirect costs for the top 300 global airports, with detailed footnotes on the supporting data. The Insight SRI research was a standard reference for 2007-2009 as it was the only source presenting costs and thus was quoted by regulators, airports, and technology providers alike. However, while that 2007 Insight SRI paper remains the best free public source of data, the new analysis (2010) from Insight SRI offers new numbers. The author of the new report (not free) says \\"Readers are cautioned not to rely on or in the future refer to numbers from the 2007-08 Insight SRI paper The Economic Cost of FOD to Airlines. This earlier effort was 'The' first document detailing the direct and indirect cost of FOD that was based on airline maintenance data (the entire document was a single page of data, followed by 8 pages of footnotes).\\" Per-flight direct costs of $26 are calculated by considering engine maintenance spending, tire replacements, and aircraft body damage. Per-flight indirect costs include a total of 31 individual categories: #Airport efficiency losses #Carbon / environmental issues #Change of aircraft #Close airport #Close runway #Corporate manslaughter/criminal liability #Cost of corrective action #Cost of hiring and training replacement #Cost of rental or lease of replacement equipment #Cost of restoration of order #Cost of the investigation #Delay for planes in air #Delays at gate #Fines and citations #Fuel efficiency losses #Hotels #In-air go-around #Increased insurance premiums #Increased operating costs on remaining equipment #Insurance deductibles #Legal fees resulting #Liability claims in excess of insurance #Loss of aircraft #Loss of business and damage to reputation #Loss of productivity of injured personnel #Loss of spares or specialized equipment #Lost time and overtime #Missed connections #Morale #Reaction by crews leading to disruption of schedule #Replacement flights on other carriers #Scheduled maintenance #Unscheduled maintenance The study concludes that when these indirect costs are added, then the cost of FOD increases by a multiple of up to 10 times. Eurocontrol and the FAA are both studying FOD. Eurocontrol released a preliminary assessment of FOD Detection technologies in 2006, while the FAA is conducting trials of the four leading systems from Qinetiq (PVD, Providence T. F. Green Airport), Stratech (ORD, Chicago O'Hare International Airport), Xsight Systems (BOS, Boston Logan International Airport), and Trex Aviation Systems (ORD, Chicago O'Hare Airport) during 2007 and 2008. Results of this study should be published in 2009.

Brownson was a publicist, a career which spanned his affiliation with the New England Transcendentalists through his subsequent conversion to Roman Catholicism. Early years and education Brownson was born on September 16, 1803, to Sylvester Augustus Brownson and Relief Metcalf, who were farmers in Stockbridge, Vermont. Sylvester Brownson died when Orestes was young and Relief decided to give her son up to a nearby adoptive family when he was six years old. The family raised him under the strict confines of Calvinist Congregationalism on a small farm in Royalton, Vermont. He did not receive much schooling but he immensely enjoyed reading books. Among these were volumes by Homer and Locke and the Bible.Maynard, Theodore (1943). Orestes Brownson: Yankee, Radical, Catholic. New York: Macmillan, pp. 2‚Äì9. In 1817, when he was fourteen, Orestes attended an academy briefly in New York. This was the extent of his formal education.Hoeveler, David (2000). \\"Brownson, Orestes Augustus\\", American National Biography Online. Religious unease In 1822, Brownson was baptized in the Presbyterian Church in Ballston, New York, but he quickly complained that Presbyterians associated only with themselves, and that the Reformed doctrines of predestination and eternal sin were too harsh. After withdrawing from Presbyterianism in 1824 and teaching at various schools in upstate New York and Detroit, Brownson applied to be a Universalist preacher. Universalism, for Brownson, represented the only liberal variety of Christianity he knew of. However, Universalism also failed to quell his desire for religious understanding. He became the editor of a Universalist journal, Gospel Advocate and Impartial Investigator, in which he wrote about his own religious doubt and criticized organized faiths and mysticism in religion.Schlesinger, Jr., Arthur M. (1963). Orestes A. Brownson: A Pilgrim's Progress. New York: Octagon Books, pp. 6‚Äì10. Later, rejecting Universalism, he became associated with Robert Dale Owen and Fanny Wright in New York City and supported the Working Men's Party of New York.Hecker, I.T. (1887). \\"Dr. Brownson and the Workingman's Party Fifty Years Ago,\\" The Catholic World, Vol. 45, No. 266, pp. 200‚Äì08. In 1830, for a few months, Brownson was editor of the Genesee Republican in Batavia, New York.History of the Press of Western New York, by Frederick Follett, page 74 (1847) In 1831, he moved to Ithaca, New York, where he became the pastor of a Unitarian community. There, he began publishing the magazine The Philanthropist. In it, he could express his ideas outside of the pulpit since he thought of himself as a better journalist than preacher. Transcendentalism Orestes Brownson. After the demise of the Philanthropist in 1832, Brownson moved to Walpole, New Hampshire, where he was a part of the Transcendentalist movement that swept through the Boston Unitarian community.Caponigri, A. Robert (1945). \\"Brownson and Emerson: Nature and History\\", The New England Quarterly, Vol. 18, No. 3, pp. 368‚Äì90. He read in English Romanticism and English and French reports on German Idealist philosophy, and was passionate about the work of Victor Cousin and Pierre Leroux. In 1836, the same year that Ralph Waldo Emerson's Nature was published, Brownson participated in the founding of the Transcendental Club. In the same year he moved to Chelsea, Massachusetts, to set up his own church, which he called \\"The Society for Christian Union and Progress\\", and publish his first book, New Views of Christianity, Society, and the Church. This work combined Transcendentalist religious views with radical social egalitarianism, sharply criticizing the unequal social distribution of wealth as un-Christian and unprincipled. After President Martin Van Buren appointed George Bancroft as Collector of Customs at Boston in 1837, Bancroft in turn gave jobs to Brownson and Nathaniel Hawthorne. In 1838, he founded the Boston Quarterly Review, and served as its editor and main contributor for four years. Other contributors included George Bancroft, Margaret Fuller, George Ripley, and Elizabeth Peabody.Lewis, R. W. B. (1955). The American Adam: Innocence, Tragedy, and Tradition in the Nineteenth Century. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, p. 185. Brownson originally offered use of the Boston Quarterly Review as a literary vehicle for the Transcendentalists; they declined and instead created The Dial.Von Mehren, Joan (1994). Minerva and the Muse: A Life of Margaret Fuller. Amherst, Massachusetts: University of Massachusetts Press, p. 120. Brownson's essays were political, intellectual, and religious. Among these was a favourable review of Thomas Carlyle's Chartism, separately published as The Laboring Classes (1840), which caused considerable controversy. The article and Brownson's review of it is sometimes blamed for causing Van Buren, whom Brownson avidly supported, to lose the 1840 election to William Henry Harrison.Schlesinger (1963), pp. 44‚Äì90. In fact, Van Buren himself is said to have \\"blamed [Brownson] as the main cause of his defeat\\" because the Boston Quarterly Review had recently promoted socialist ideas.Brownson, Henry (1908). Orestes Augustus Brownson. The Catholic Encyclopedia In 1840 Brownson published his semi-autobiographical work, Charles Elwood; Or, The Infidel Converted. Through the protagonist, Brownson railed against organized religion and questioned the Bible's infallibility, or truthfulness. In 1842, Brownson ceased separate publication of the Boston Quarterly Review, and it was merged into The United States Magazine and Democratic Review, but his beliefs were once again evolving. He found it necessary to break with the Review after a series of his essays created new scandal. Conversion to Catholicism In the spring of 1843, rumors spread that Brownson was considering converting to Catholicism, especially when he met with the Roman Catholic Bishop of Boston.Packer, Barbara L. (2007) The Transcendentalists. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, pg. 171; He finally converted on October 20, 1844,Lewis, R.W.B. (1955). The American Adam: Innocence, Tragedy, and Tradition in the Nineteenth Century. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, p. 184. his religion for the rest of his life. He began to believe, in contrast to his Transcendentalist colleagues, in the inherent sinfulness of humanity.Grocholoski, Krystyna (1999) Orestes Brownson. American Transcendentalism Web. Further, he began to associate Protestantism with capitalist notions he despised.Hoeveler David. (2000) \\"Brownson, Orestes Augustus\\", in American National Biography Online. \\"Anticipating Max Weber's argument about the symbiotic relationship between Protestantism and the spirit of capitalism, Brownson dismisses Protestantism as being too concerned with material goods and as engendering an ethic of unfettered individualism that results in social fragmentation and even, in the end, a 'spirit of lawlessness.'\\" Paul Giles, American Catholic Arts and Fictions: Culture, Ideology, Aesthetics (Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 67. Giles refers to Brownson's \\"Protestantism in a Nutshell.\\" He soon renounced what he now considered the errors of his past, including Transcendentalism and liberalism, and devoted himself to writing articles dedicated to converting America to Catholicism.See for example his debunking of a Presbyterian sermon entitled \\"The Dangers of Jesuit Instruction.\\" Brownson used his articles to strike out against his former friends in the Transcendental movement, whom, he wrote, would be damned unless they converted as well. He succeeded in persuading Sophia Ripley, wife of George Ripley, to convert, but few others. At the same time, he lost the respect of many of his correspondents. According to one scholar, after his conversion, Brownson's writing changed, and the work he published in Brownson's Quarterly Review expressed \\"liberal views [that] frequently got Brownson into trouble, sometimes with the Catholic hierarchy.\\" His conversion prompted him to be overzealous in defense of the Catholic Church. His unruly enthusiasm resulted in letters from local Catholic journalists and even the bishop of his diocese requesting that he cease leveling such harsh criticisms.Schlesinger (1963), pp. 200‚Äì10. Brownson's stance had much in common with the liberal Catholicism of Charles de Montalembert, with whom he corresponded, and he published articles in French liberal Catholic publications such as Le Correspondant, taking the side of the liberals against the conservative Catholics such as Louis Veuillot. Brownson had also been writing many articles for the Paulist Fathers' Catholic World publication. Brownson now saw Catholicism as the only religion that could restrain the undisciplined American citizens and thus ensure the success of democracy.See Carl F. Krummel, \\"Catholicism, Americanism, Democracy, and Orestes Brownson,\\" American Quarterly 6, no. 1 (Spring, 1954): 19‚Äì31, here 24. To him, the United States was to be a model to the world, and the ideal model was a Catholic America. He repudiated his earlier Fourierist and Owenite ideas, now criticizing socialism and utopianism as vigorously as he had once promoted them. A staunch Douglas Democrat, Brownson, like Douglas, supported the Union in the Civil War and polemicized against the Confederacy and against Catholic clergy who endorsed secession. He avidly supported emancipation and even made several trips to Washington to discuss the importance and urgency of emancipation with President Lincoln. He encouraged all Americans, especially Catholics, to be patriots in the country‚Äôs time of turmoil.\\"Notre Dame Archives Index BRO002\\", archives.nd.edu; accessed April 23, 2018. After his conversion, he revived his former publication, now renamed Brownson's Quarterly Review, in 1844. From 1844‚Äì64, Brownson maintained the Review as a Catholic journal of opinion, including many reviews of \\"inspirational novels\\" meant to encourage Catholic belief.Thorp, Willard (1978). Catholic Novelists in Defense of Their Faith, 1829-1865. New York: Arno Press, A New York Times Company. A single volume in the complete set The American Catholic Tradition; In 1853, he wrote a series of articles that claimed that the Church was supreme over the State. These writings caused a controversy among Catholic immigrants and the entire Catholic community in general. This controversy caused bishops all over New England to begin condemning his writings. He became increasingly lonely as a result of his being shunned from Boston communities, so he moved the Review and his family to New York in 1855, where he revived his interest in Catholic political philosophy. In 1860, he announced that the Catholic Church must progress towards a welcoming intellectual environment. He argued forcefully and eloquently that \\"neither the friends nor the enemies of religion have anything to fear from adopting the great principle of civil and religious liberty, and asserting a free Church in a free State.\\"Orestes Brownson, Civil and Religious Freedom from Seeking the Truth, LOGOS: A Journal of Catholic Thought and Culture, 20:4 (Fall 2017) pp. 124‚Äì62, here 158. Brownson noted with dismay how few European Catholics supported abolition, and applauded liberal Catholics like Montalembert for being \\"the only Catholics in Europe who sympathize with the loyal people of the Union.\\" He posited that conscience must remain free to believe as it decides, and religion deals with the spiritual, not the civil realm. The State should protect such a right and restrict itself to governance of the external realm. He thus adopted a new form of liberalism that remained with him until his death,Maynard (1943), pp. 281‚Äì311. although his enthusiasm for such a liberalism must be balanced by a near simultaneous and unambiguous repudiation of liberalism which he expressed in the resuscitated Quarterly Review in 1873.\\"Brownson's Quarterly Review\\", Last Series, Vol. 1, January 1873, p. 2. (Pustet, New York, 1873). There he rejected the kind of liberalism that makes \\"this world and its interests supreme.\\" In 1862, he was nominated for a Republican Congressional spot in third district of New Jersey, but was met with failure that was blamed on his open Catholic views.See Henry Francis Brownson, Orestes A. Brownson's Latter Life: From 1856 to 1876 (Detroit, Michigan: H. F. Brownson, 1900): 381. In 1864, John Fr√©mont, whom Brownson strongly supported, withdrew from the Presidential race. After these two defeats, Brownson‚Äôs declining health, spirit, and subscribers caused him to stop publishing the Review the same year. The journal was relaunched again later in Brownson's life after a nearly ten-year hiatus, in 1873. The Review finally ceased publication in 1875, the year before Brownson's death. In 1857, Brownson wrote a memoir, The Convert; or, Leaves from My Experience. Death Brownson died on April 17, 1876 in Detroit, aged 72.\\"Notre Dame Archives Index BRO002\\" http://archives.nd.edu/findaids/ead/index/BRO002.htm. His remains were subsequently transferred to the crypt of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at the University of Notre Dame, where his personal papers are also archived. Legacy and criticism Response to Orestes Brownson's views was mixed during his lifetime. He was invited to New Orleans in 1855 by the publication Le Propagateur, because he was viewed as a figure whom both Protestants and Catholics might enjoy hearing from, because of his multiple political and religious associations during his life. Although various newspapers recorded contradictory opinions on his lectures, all praised his \\"eloquent\\" speech.LeBreton, Dagmar Renshaw, \\"Orestes Brownson's visit to New Orleans in 1855,\\" American Literature 16, no. 2 (May 1944): 110‚Äì14, here 112. In 1850s, among his many intellectual contributions, in the midst of Irish and German immigration debate and related nativist moral panic, Brownson introduced the term \\"Americanization\\" into the public discourse while delivering a lecture, \\"Church and the Republic\\", at St. John‚Äôs College, future Fordham University.Elteren, Mel van. Americanism and Americanization: A Critical History of Domestic and Global Influence. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Co, 2006, p. 52.Patrick Verel.

His attempts to harmonize ethnic immigrant identities with American democratic tradition without social and cultural homogenization are considered as an early move in the direction of multiculturalism.Gregory S. Butler. Orestes Brownson and American Nativism, Crisis Magazine, April 1, 1996. Brownson is often incorrectly credited with being the person to coin the term Odinism, referring to his 1848 \\"Letter to Protestants\\".His use of \\"Odinism\\" can be found in The Works of Orestes Brownson, Vol. V (Detroit, 1885), pp. 256‚Äì257. The OED dates the word at least as far back as 1822: tr. C. Malte-Brun Universal Geogr. I. 577: \\"Some authentic records give us an idea of Odinism, which prevailed in Scandinavia.\\" Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. Odinism. Brownson was summed up by poet and critic James Russell Lowell in his satirical A Fable for Critics as someone trying to bite off more than he could chew: \\"his mouth very full with attempting to gulp a Gregorian bull\\".Duberman, Martin (1966). James Russell Lowell. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, p. 98. Edgar Allan Poe refers to Brownson in his Autography series, calling him \\"an extraordinary man,\\" though he \\"has not altogether succeeded in convincing himself of those important truths which he is so anxious to impress upon his readers.\\"Sova, Dawn B. (2001). Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, p. 37 He is also mentioned in Poe's story \\"Mesmeric Revelation,\\" referring to Brownson's 1840 novel Charles Eldwood; or, The Infidel Converted. While reviewing Brownson's biography penned by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., Henry Steele Commager noted that: \\"In his day Orestes Brownson was respected and feared as were few of his contemporaries; European philosophers regarded him with hope; American politicians enlisted his vitriolic pen; denominations competed for his eloquence; and when he listed himself among the three most profound men in America there were those who took him seriously.\\"Henry Steele Commager. That Sturdy but Erratic Reformer, Orestes Brownson, The New York Times - Books, April 23, 1939. Peter J. Stanlis has pointed out that \\"In the generation following the founding fathers of the American republic, Orestes Brownson (1803‚Äì1876), together with John C. Calhoun, was probably the most original and profound political thinker of the nineteenth century. Woodrow Wilson considered his most important book, The American Republic (1865), the best study of the American constitution.\\" Peter J. Stanlis, \\"The Enduring Brownson.\\" Review of In Search of the American Spirit: The Political Thought of Orestes Brownson by Gregory S. Butler. \\"Best of the Bookman,\\" April 10, 2011. Additionally, Brownson was held in high regard by many European intellectuals and theologians, including Auguste Joseph Alphonse Gratry, who called Brownson \\"the keenest critic of the 19th century, an indomitable logician, a disinterested lover of truth, a sage, as sharp as Aristotle, as lofty as Plato.\\"Maurer, Armand. 1992. Orestes Brownson and Christian Philosophy. The Monist 75 (3, Christian Philosophy) (JULY): 341-53, at page 342. Great Britain‚Äôs Lord Acton visited with Brownson and later wrote that ‚ÄúIntellectually, no American I have met comes near him.‚Äù Cited by Gerald Russello, \\"Orestes Brownson Was a Uniquely American Voice in the Church,\\" National Catholic Register, Blogs, June 7, 2017. Family Orestes's brother, Oran Brownson, joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about the same time Orestes became a Roman Catholic.
