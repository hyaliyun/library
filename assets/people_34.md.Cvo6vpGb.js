Kadavu also belongs to the Burebasaga Confederacy, a hierarchy of chiefs from southern and western Fiji with Roko Tui Dreketi of Rewa as the paramount chief. It consists of Kadavu Island, Ono Island, Galoa Island, Dravuni Island, Matanuku Island, Buliya Island, Nagigia Island, and a few other islands. Kadavu has a total land area of 408 square kilometers, with a population of 10,897 at the most recent census in 2017, making it the fourth least populous province. The Kadavu group is volcanic in nature, the main island being Kadavu, which is 93 km long and varies in width from several hundred metres to 13 km, All its coasts are deeply indented, some bays biting so far into the land that they almost divide the island. One geographer has suggested that the shape of Kadavu resembles that of a wasp, with the head, thorax and abdomen linked by narrow waists. Thus Vunisea (the administrative center), Namalata Bay and Galoa Harbor are separated by only a sandy isthmus standing a few meters above sea level; and at Vunisea the heads of Daku Bay and Soso Bay are within 1100 meters of each other, with only a low ridge between. The province is divided into nine tikina (districts), each with its own paramount chief and chiefly villages. The tikinas are Tavuki (Tavuki), Naceva (Soso), Nabukelevu (Daviqele), Nakasaleka (Lomanikoro), Sanima (Drue), Yale (Rakiraki), Yawe (Nalotu), Ono (Vabea) and Ravitaki (Ravitaki). Each high chief is a member of the Kadavu Provincial Council. There are 75 villages in the province of Kadavu. The Kadavu dialects are almost as numerous as the tikinas but with tiny variations between dialects. The Kadavu dialects are closer to the Rewa dialect in Ono and then closer to the Beqa, Serua and Vatulele dialect in the main island with more similarities with the Nadroga and Ba dialects as one move towards the south of the island. This could all indicate the origin of the inhabitants to an extent. Kadavu is also the home of the second-largest living organism on Earth, the Great Astrolabe Reef, which lies along the southern side of the island and stretches from the northern part of the island, Ono island, to the southern tip of Kadavu Island, Muanasika Point near Nasau village. The edges of this reef are indicated by two lighthouses: the Solo Light House near Ono Island, and the Washington Lighthouse close to Nagigia Island. There is no town on the island but Vunisea is where all the government headquarters are, with one high school (boarding school), a primary school, police station, hospital, airstrip and at least five supermarkets. However, there are also two main other stations apart from Vunisea: Kavala and Daviqele. Despite its proximity to the population center of Viti Levu, the population of Kadavu is deeply conservative. Perhaps the conservatism can be traced to the difficulty of getting around the island and the resulting isolation of its communities. Though remote, Kadavu is well known by divers for its rich diversity of undersea life, particularly in the Astrolabe Reef. Likewise there is a great deal of terrestrial flora and fauna of interest, particularly the birds. The colorful Kadavu Parrot, which is now a protected species, can be easily observed. Over the last five to ten years a number of mid-range properties (as well as one uber-deluxe resort) have sprouted up on Kadavu. For visitors interested in getting away from the typical tourist haunts of the Nadi area, Kadavu is a good option. If you are not a diver, surfing during the winter months is quite good. Kadavu can be reached by air from Nadi and Suva. There is also ferry service from Gounder‚Äôs Lomaiviti Princess on Tuesdays and Fridays from Suva (arriving respectively on Wednesdays and Saturdays). Prices are F$44 for economy and F$75 for first class. I suggest you splurge for first class. When economy seats are full, passengers are sprawled out out on any surface they can find.

It incorporates the museum of the Royal Leicestershire Regiment, and has a range of exhibits illustrating post-medieval and contemporary Leicester. The museum is close to the 15th century Magazine Gateway and within the precincts of the medieval 'Newarke', the 'New Work' of Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster. The museum stands in the middle of the De Montfort University campus. History The museum occupies two buildings: Wyggeston's Chantry House (built circa 1511), and Thomas Skeffington's Skeffington House (built in the seventeenth century). The houses were used during the Siege of Leicester in 1645 as part of the English Civil. The two properties were sold in 1908 and while Chantry House remained a private residence, Skeffington House became a school for boys. Both properties were acquired and converted for museum use to 1953 as part of the celebrations surrounding the coronation of the Queen. One room on the ground floor of the museum has been kept to represent what the houses would have looked like in the 17th Century. Collections Amongst the items on display are various possessions of Daniel Lambert, an 18th-century resident of Leicester who weighed over and became famous in his lifetime as Britain's largest man, and remains one of the city's famous icons. Possessions on display include items of clothing and his chair. The museum also houses a 1950s Leicester street scene modelled in Wharf Street with a number of model shops, as well as an exhibition of toys from Tudor times to the present. Other collections relate to Leicester's industrial and hosiery industry, such as Corah's and Wolsey, major clothing firms in Leicester. The museum has an exhibit with a particularly focus on the more recent history of Leicester, from the 19th century onward. During the period 2014 to 2018 it held a rolling series of exhibitions marking the centenary of the First World War entitled 'Leicester Remembers'. The museum also includes a display about the Royal Leicestershire Regiment, such as drums used by the regiment band, and a tiger, the mascot of the regiment. The museum houses a large collection of items relating to life during the wars. These cover aspects of the front-line and home front. The museum holds a large collection of medals, with records regarding the involvement of people within the Leicester Regiment, which can be accessed via a computer. A model trench sits on the first floor. Other items include a Morrison Shelter and gas masks to reflect the Home Front during the Second World War. Gardens The gardens of the museum are laid out on separate sides of the main building which has an extension into the garden. These are laid to box hedges in medieval style maze-like geometric patterns. The garden was stocked in Victorian times with a variety of exotic trees and other plants, several of which survive to the present day. The end wall of the garden had gun loops cut in it by Cromwell's troops, the Round- heads, in the English Civil War when the Cavalier Prince Rupert was besieging the town in 1645. These features are evident today and are a sign of Leicester's involvement in the English Civil War.

Only Peking opera is more popular nationwide.Yueju Opera: Century- old art Originating in Shengzhou, Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province in 1906, Yue opera features actresses in male roles as well as femininity in terms of singing, performing, and staging. Despite its rural origin, it has found a second home in Shanghai, China's most affluent city, where it managed to out- compete both Peking opera and the native Shanghai opera. Besides Shanghai and Zhejiang, major markets are found in Jiangsu and Fujian, while hundreds of troupes still operate all over China. Like its performers, Yue opera fans are mainly women, resulting in a disproportionate number of love stories in its repertoire and very little acrobatic fighting.

It was initially an entertainment for people in Sheng County. Its lyrics are mostly collected from conversations between farmers while they were working. Audiences loved these ballads because of their vivid description of daily life. The Second Opium War interfered with the local economy of Sheng County, located in the Jiangnan area, near Shanghai. Since Sheng County agriculturalists were experiencing difficulty earning their livelihoods, they started to turn this folk art into a second source of income. Over years, the accumulation of lyrics built up the fundamental source materials for Yue opera, and the folk music gradually developed its own style. Performers also began to integrate simple acting and accompanying instruments into the folk music. It gradually became well known, both in Sheng County and neighboring counties. =Beginnings= According to oral history passed down by Yue Opera practitioners, Yue Opera began in 1906. At the end of the first month of the lunar year Zhƒìngyu√® (simplified Chinese:Ê≠£Êúà) in 1906, artists gathered together in Chen Wanyuan (simplified Chinese: Èôà‰∏áÂÖÉ)'s house. Although these artists usually only performed in groups of two or three and had never performed together before, Chen and other residents encouraged them to put on a joint production instead of multiple separate retelling of the stories. The first performance was thus generated. The show turned out to be a great success, and residents were delighted and willing to talk about it. Over time more and more counties invited them to perform. Because the music's tones were similar to those of Shange (ShƒÅn Gƒì,Â±±Ê≠å) people named this art Small Tunes and Songs Troupes (pinyin: Xiao Gƒì W√©n Sh≈´ BƒÅn, simplified Chinese:Â∞èÊ≠åÊñá‰π¶Áè≠). The small in the name referred to its humble folk foundation and contrasted it with \\"large\\" formal opera from the area. Performances were simple. Actors were often peasants who would perform between busy agricultural seasons. They often had no costumes and only a few props, though sometimes rented simple costumes from larger local opera troupes. Musical accompaniment was sparse consisting of only a pair of drums and a wooden clapper played by a performer offstage. This made the performances very mobile allowing the troupes to perform throughout the region. The opera used plain language in the vernacular which made it accessible and popular with local populations. =Initial Development= As Small Tunes and Songs Troupes expanded in size and popularity, it entered Shanghai theaters. Due to its unique, elegant and soft singing style compared with other political and spectacular performances, Yue opera found an audience there. It soon changed its name to ShaoXing Civil Opera (pinyin: Sh√†o Xing W√©n X√¨ ÁªçÂÖ¥ÊñáÊàè) in 1916, to better represent its performances as art pieces that reflected regional culture. However, both the singing style and banhu fiddle (accompaniment) that ShaoXing Civil Opera utilized were under-developed and vulgar compared with other, more delicate operas in Shanghai. It soon lost its prestige and popularity in this big city. Returning to their roots in Sheng County, ShaoXing Civic Opera performers like Jinshui Wang (simplified Chinese: ÁéãÈáëÊ∞¥) put great effort into improving their performance and singing style. These artists absorbed the essence of different opera styles including Beijing Opera they had seen in Shanghai. During this process, Four Gong Pitch (pinyin: S√¨ G≈çng QiƒÅng, simplified Chinese: ÂõõÂ∑•ËÖî) became the remarkable fruit of this blending. This music pitch is extraordinary because it resolved the unnatural status women have when they play male roles. ShaoXing Civic Operatic Troupe further developed a systematic training in singing style and sound practice. It utilized erhu and other linear fiddles as alternative accompaniments to adjust music. =Women-performed opera= When Jinshui Wang came back to Sheng County, he had been deeply impressed by the prosperous artistic atmosphere in Shanghai. Having seen different forms of opera during that time and saw the business opportunities in founding an opera performed by women. In February, 1923, he opened an all girls opera class and spent huge amount of money attracting and rewarding young women to join. (\\"Class\\" here is an organization in which members work and study at the same time.) However, the first class existed for only six years. It was transformed into the first professional women's troupe at the end of the girl's apprenticeship. In the 1920s, the social status of both women and arts performers (also known as Xizi, ÊàèÂ≠ê) was very humble. Governments assumed that operas performed by women would lower the value of the art. Under great pressure and in a limited business market, the first wave of female artists left the class after six years for marriage. The progress these artists achieved was noteworthy. As the influence of their opera grew, more and more female classes were founded. By the beginning of the 1930s, Zhejiang Province had about two hundred female classes as well and two thousand students. The rise of Shaoxing Literal Opera in the early 1930s There are two well-known explanations for the rise of Shaoxing Literal Opera at that time. One of them is economic incentive. In the early 20th century, young Chinese women had only two options to earn their livelihoods. They were either sent to a wealthy family as a child bride, or to the factories to work. In 1929, the Wall Street Crash had tremendous global influence. Many factories in Shanghai closed down, and as a result, women often had no option but to attend female-performed opera classes to earn a living. These women usually received three months acting training, and then participated in performances to gain more experience in acting. Another explanation was that the performing style of Shaoxing Literal Opera fit with women's nature . As young women tend to be more glorious on stage according to Sheng County's newspaper at that time, the tender and gentle features of Shaoxing Literal Art became more outstanding under such highlighting. Furthermore, Four Gong Qiang worked more vividly and delicately under women's performances. =Evolution= Originating in the folk song and ballad singing of rural areas in Zhejiang, by drawing on the experience of other developed Chinese opera forms such as Peking opera and Kunqu, Yueju opera became popular in Shanghai in early 1930s. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Yueju performers in Shanghai launched a movement to reform the Yueju performance which drew influences from, new-style literature (a part of the New Culture Movement), Western drama and film, making their opera remarkably different from other forms in China. A director-centered system replaced the scene plot system that dictated how a part or scene should be acted. There was an increasing focus on the depiction of the personality and psychology of characters. New operas on new themes were developed including an adaption of Lu Xun's novel \\"New Year Sacrifice\\" <Á•ùÁ¶è>. After the foundation of People's Republic of China, Yueju opera was welcomed by the government and Communist Party of China at first, and reached a pinnacle popularity in late 1950s and early 1960s. During this period there was increased emphasis on dramatic realism and expressionism. However, during the Cultural Revolution, like other traditional Chinese art forms, Yueju performances were outlawed, which caused a serious setback in its development. Since the 1980s, Yueju has become popular again, while being challenged by new amusement forms. Yueju opera features are elegant and soft, suitable for telling love stories. It was initially performed by men only, but female groups started performing in the style in 1923, and during the 1930s, the form became female-only. Two Stage Sisters is a 1964 movie featuring Shaoxing Opera.

Early life  Havadtoy was born in London from a Romanian-born ethnic Hungarian father and a Hungarian mother. The family returned to their homeland in the spring of 1956, just before the Hungarian Revolution broke out. After the Revolution it became increasingly difficult for the family to go back to the Western Bloc. It took 14 years for Havadtoy to acquire his British citizenship. Eventually, in 1971 he fled Hungary, through the former Yugoslavia, back to the United Kingdom, where he met the antique dealer and interior designer Stuart Greet. With Greet's invitation, Havadtoy moved to New York City, where he resided with gaps ‚Äî e.g. he lived four years in Geneva, Switzerland - from there on until 2000.  New York  In 1978, he founded Samuel Havadtoy Gallery, an interior design gallery where he worked as an interior designer until 1981. Havadtoy designed the interiors of the homes of several notable artists, including John Lennon and Keith Haring. In 1981, Havadtoy turned to New York's artistic scene, where he became close friends with notable artists such as Haring, Andy Warhol, George Condo, Donald Baechler, and Yoko Ono, with whom Havadtoy began a relationship (after John Lennon's assassination), being her companion for over twenty years until 2001. Havadtoy inspired and contributed to many of Keith Haring's late works, for example in the making of his triptych, The Life of Christ.Brozan, Nadine. \\"CHRONICLE,\\" New York Times (June 28, 1994). Havadtoy started painting at a young age, just after moving to New York, but acquired his unmistakable style during the 1980s. He mainly uses oil, acrylic, and mixed techniques for his paintings. Havadtoy's works reflect subtle blends of different cultures, mostly Middle European and American popular culture.  Gallery 56  In the second half of the 80s, due to the gradually dissolving Eastern Bloc, Havadtoy travelled increasingly to Hungary. In 1992, he founded Gallery 56, which became significant in the Hungarian contemporary art scene, among others, by exposing important artists who were considered rarities at the time. The gallery focused mainly on displaying American artists, for example Haring, Warhol, Agnes Martin, Cindy Sherman, Kiki Smith, Robert Mapplethorpe, Ross Bleckner, Donald Sultan, Donald Baechler. Some of the artists also participated personally on the vernissages. Living classics of Hungarian contemporary art were also represented and giant talents such as, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy. The name of the gallery comes from Yoko Ono, who alluded to the approaching revolution in the artworld. In 2000, Havadtoy relocated to Europe and is currently living in Hungary and Liguria, Italy.

Based on perceived similarities between the names, he is sometimes also called Sulaiman I (Abecedario: S√∫l√°iman, from Arabic: sulaiman ÿ≥ŸÑŸäŸÖÿßŸÜ) in the belief that he shared the name of his supposed grandson, Rajah Sulayman. Oral traditions cited by Odal-Devora (2000) identify him as a son of the legendary Dayang Kalangitan and Rajah Lontok. Genealogical traditions cited by Majul (1973) claim that he converted to Islam from indigenous Tagalog beliefs as a result of the missionary efforts of the Sultanate of Brunei. Salalila's rule ended when he died some time in the early 1500s, and he was succeeded by his wife, who was not named in historical accounts. By 1570, his son Ache had succeeded to the position himself, and had come to be known as \\"Rajah Matanda\\" (lit. \\"Old Rajah\\").  Sources  Little is known for sure about Salalila due to the lack of firsthand documentary sources covering the timeframe of his life and reign. The little that is known for certain by scholars comes from the account given by his son \\"Prince\\" Ache\\"Prince\\" was a title the Spanish used to describe Ache, since he was the son of the Paramount ruler of Maynila. It is unknown what exact local title Ache used to introduce himself to the Spanish. to Sebastian Elcano and the other surviving members of the Magellan expedition in 1521. Some additional details can be gleaned from extant genealogical sources, such as the \\"Lakandula documents\\" deposited at the Philippine National Archives but these accounts are often conflicting and present conflicts interest. As a result, the factuality and accuracy of the details presented in these documents requires careful assessment by historiographers.  Name  =Identification in historical documents as \\"Salalila\\"= The records of Ache's 1521 account before the crew of Sebastian Elcano's expedition did not identify Salalila by name. However, he is referred to using the name \\"Salalila\\" in the \\"Lakandula documents\\" deposited at the Philippine National Archives, as well as by apocryphal sources, such as the alleged 1539 \\"Will of Pansomun\\". =Sulaiman theory= His supposed identification as \\"Sulaiman I\\" was presented as a theory in the 1950s, based on the similarities of \\"Salalila\\" and \\"Suleiman\\". However, this identification is the subject of debate among present-day historiographers.  Known relations  = Historically documented relations = A number of Salalila's relations are documented in Ache (Rajah Matanda)'s 1521 account. This includes: * Ache (Rajah Matanda), Salalila's son ‚Äì Self-acknowledged to be Salalila's son * Salalila's widow, Ache's mother ‚Äì Not specifically named in the 1521 accounts of Aganduru Moriz, Gines de Mafra or Antonio Pigaffetta, but sometimes named \\"Dayang Ysmeria\\" in 20th century folk traditions.This \\"20th century folk tradition\\" consists of traditions recorded on early local government websites, whose provenance cannot be definitively traced to earlier than the 20th century. * Ache's \\"cousin\\", the ruler of Tondo ‚Äì Presumably also related to Salalila, this cousin is believed to be roughly Ache's age, but had already become Lakan of Tondo by 1521, when he was allegedly encroaching on the territory of Maynila, then ruled by Ache's mother. It is not known if \\"cousin\\" is a precise term, or a general term meaning a \\"relative\\". * The Sultan of Brunei, Ache's \\"grandfather\\" ‚Äì The 1521 accounts all specify that Ache had run away from Maynila as a young man to seek the political and military support of his grandfather, the Sultan of Brunei, against the Lakan of Tondo. Salalila's exact relationship (by consanguinity or by law) with this Sultan of Brunei is not specified in the extant accounts, and it is not known if \\"grandfather\\" is a precise term, or a general term meaning an \\"ancestor\\". * Rajah Sulayman ‚Äì According to the genealogical research done by Luis Camara Dery, investigating the National Archives' \\"Lakandula documents\\" in particular, Ache is believed to have had an unnamed younger brother, who became the father of the Rajah Sulayman, who met De Goiti and Legaspi in 1570‚Äì71. Some 20th century traditions name this younger brother Suleiman II, with the Sulayman of the 1570s supposedly being Suleiman III. However, the provenance of these traditions is unclear. = Other relations as told by Folk traditions = 20th century folk traditions hold Salalila to be a son of Dayang Kalangitan and Rajah Lontok.  Death and succession  According to Ache's 1521 account, Salalila died while Ache was still very young, and was succeeded by his wife, who was not named in the accounts. By 1570, Salalila's wife had died and Ache had succeeded to Salalila's position himself, and introduced himself as \\"Rajah Matanda\\" to the forces of Martin de Goiti (in 1570) and Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi (in 1571).

He was eventually freed after his case was expedited. This episode was repeated in a number of his plays. With Paths in Twilight in 1948, he made his cinematic debut under the direction of Gustav Fr√∂hlich. In 1960, he was in one of the first films by Edgar Wallace after the war: Der R√§cher. In the same year, he was in Es ist soweit. In 1966, he acted alongside Heinz Reincke in one of the first German colour television series, Adrian der Tulpendieb.

The building, constructed from 1714 to 1720 for a rich Jewish merchant, the Court Jew Abraham Elias Model, is most notable for its ceilings, displaying motifs from the Old Testament, or Tanakh, which were restored in 1978 and 1994 respectively. Monheim - Kleine Stadt mit grosser Vergangenheit, Chapter: Jews as citizens in Monheim, by: Emeran Meyer (Mayor of Monheim 1978-84), page: 117-123Die Junge Pfalz The young Palatinate, page: 11, accessed: 6 August 2010 History =The Jewish community= The Jewish community in Monheim was established in 1697, when Duke Johann Wilhelm allowed six Jewish families which had been banned from Eichst√§tt, to settle in Monheim. The new community was allowed to acquire property in Monheim, to construct a Synagogue and to work as merchants in town. In the following years, the community grew considerably, numbering 19 families and 150 people by 1737.History of the Jewish community in Monheim , accessed: 6 August 2010 The prospering community however raised concerns with the local population, which was worried about eventually becoming outnumbered in town. In 1736, restrictions were passed, allowing only a limited number of weddings to be conducted by the local Jews at considerable cost. In 1741, Duke Charles III Philip passed an act banning all Jews from Palatinate-Neuburg. By the 31 July 1741, all Jews had to leave his lands and were only permitted to take with them what they could carry. No financial compensation was made for their loss of property. The Jews from Monheim left for the towns in the region not part of Palatinate-Neuburg and their origin from Monheim remains obvious through the surname Monheim or Monheimer. =The town hall= The location of the current town hall was acquired by Abraham Elias Model in 1712 from Ferdinand Kugler for 1,025 Gulden. The later owned a brewery and guest house at the spot, called Gasthaus zur Rose. Model had the old building demolished and commissioned a new building to be constructed, which was erected between 1714 and 1720. The new building, which was referred to in the local town chronicles as \\"very precious\\", was built in Baroque style. It was a square three-story building which was richly decorated, especially the ceilings. The main room on the second floor, now the council chambers, depict Abraham being prevented by the angel from sacrificing Isaac, with a text in Hebrew from the Book of Genesis. The ceiling, long hidden, was only restored in 1978. Two more ceilings, also on the second floor, were restored in 1994. One depicts Moses receiving the Ten Commandments while the other shows King David playing the harp. For a time it was assumed that the house also functioned as a synagogue, Monheim having had a Rabbi since 1715, but this has since been disproven. Nothing is left of the former synagogue, which was located in the nearby building that later became the guest house Zum Ochsen. With the forced departure of the Jews in 1741, the building came into non-Jewish, private possession. In 1853, it was acquired by the town from the brewer Anton Wunderlich, to be used as a school house. For this purpose, the chamber that is now the main council chamber was subdivided into two rooms. The rooms were nevertheless insufficient to house all pupils and a separate building was constructed from 1892 to 1895 to house the school boys, while the girls stayed at the town hall. Eventually, two more, larger schools were completed, one in 1957 and 1976. With the completion of the later, the town hall ceased to be required for schooling purposes. Monheim - Kleine Stadt mit grosser Vergangenheit, Chapter: \\"To read and to write...\\", by: Dr. Paul Olbrich, page: 137-144 The ceilings on the second floor can be visited free of charge during the opening hours of the town hall, provided no marriages or council meetings take place in the rooms at the time.

A member of the Redemptorists, he has been the Archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, since his installation on January 6, 2017. He had served as the Archbishop of Indianapolis since 2012 and as secretary of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life (CICLSAL) from 2010 to 2012. He has been a cardinal since November 19, 2016. Early life and education Tobin was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1952, the oldest of the 13 children of Joseph W. Tobin and Marie Terese Kerwin. He was baptized five days after his birth at the historic Church of the Most Holy Redeemer, founded and administered by the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (better known as the Redemptorist Fathers). He later attended the parochial school there. By the time he had graduated, Tobin felt called to serve as a Catholic priest and applied to the Redemptorists, by whom he was accepted as a candidate. He then attended St. Joseph's Preparatory College in Edgerton, Wisconsin, the Redemptorists' minor seminary. After graduating in 1970, he was received into the novitiate of the congregation to begin his formation as a member. He made his temporary profession of religious vows as a member of the congregation on August 5, 1972, and his perpetual vows on August 21, 1976. In 1975 Tobin gained a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Holy Redeemer College in Waterford, Wisconsin, after which he was sent to study at Mount St. Alphonsus Seminary in Esopus, New York, where he earned the degrees of Master in Religious Education (1977) and Master of Divinity in Pastoral Theology (1979). Ordination and ministry Tobin in 2007 Tobin was ordained a priest on June 1, 1978. The following year he returned to his childhood home, when he was appointed the parochial vicar of Holy Redeemer Parish in Detroit. He was later named pastor there, serving from 1984 to 1990. From 1980 to 1986 he served as an episcopal vicar for the Archdiocese of Detroit, and also assisted at the local diocesan marriage tribunal. From 1990 to 1991 he served as pastor of St. Alphonsus Parish in Chicago, Illinois.\\"Biography of His Eminence, Joseph William Cardinal Tobin, C.Ss.R.\\", Archdiocese of Newark Tobin was elected General Consultor of the Redemptorist Fathers in 1991 and on September 9, 1997, was elected Superior General, being confirmed for another term in this post on September 26, 2003. That same year he became Vice-President of the Union of Superiors General. He was also a member of the Council for Relations between the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life and the International Union of Superiors General from 2001 to 2009. In 2005, he participated in a Synod of Bishops in Rome, where he spent a week in a Spanish-language discussion group that included the Archbishop of Buenos Aires, who later became Pope Francis and named Tobin a cardinal. Tobin spent 2010 taking a sabbatical attached to Blackfriars Hall, Oxford, residing with the De La Salle Brothers. He pursued his interest in the rise of secularisation and secular culture, attending seminars by the sociologist of religion and anthropologist Peter Clarke, studying at the Las Casas Institute and taking classes at Blackfriars. Tobin speaks English, Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese. Roman Curia In May 2009 Tobin was named to oversee the professed men's element of the Apostolic Visitation of the Church in Ireland, scheduled for September 2010. On August 2, 2010, Tobin was appointed secretary of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life (CICLSAL) and titular Archbishop of Obba. Tobin was the second US cleric to hold the post. Tobin was told of his appointment two weeks before it was announced. He recalled: Tobin received his episcopal consecration in Rome on October 9, 2010. He had said: When Tobin arrived at CICLSAL, it was already conducting a visitation‚Äîa critical inspection of ministries and organization‚Äîof the 341 institutes of apostolic women religious in the United States. And the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) was conducting a doctrinal assessment of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR), focused on theological orthodoxy. In December 2010 Tobin said that Rome needed to acknowledge the \\"depth of anger and hurt\\" provoked by a visitation, saying it illustrated the need for a \\"strategy of reconciliation\\" with women religious. The CDF issued its report on the LCWR in April 2012, and Tobin was reportedly unhappy both with its content and with the failure of the CDF to consult with him before releasing it. Archbishop of Indianapolis On October 18, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI reassigned Tobin from his Curia post to head the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis, a Catholic community of 246,000. He was installed on December 3, 2012. His reassignment had been rumored since Tobin had made known his unhappiness with Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's highly critical report on the LCWR in the United States in April 2012. In June 2014, Tobin warned that ideological polarization of American political life \\"helps to contribute to the balkanization of American Catholics into so- called right wing and left wing, or progressive and traditionalist, factions, who point fingers at each other\\". Speaking at a meeting of the College Theology Society he said that: \\"In my opinion, finger pointing does a great harm to religious life because it makes us defensive ... [and] we feel constantly compelled to defend ourselves against other parties in the church.\\" In May 2016, Tobin was named to oversee the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, a religious community that a Vatican review had found in need of thorough-going reform. =Cardinal= On October 9, 2016, Pope Francis announced that Tobin would be made a cardinal in a papal consistory to be held on November 19, 2016. On that day he was made a Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria delle Grazie a Via Trionfale. He was named a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture on 11 November 2019. Archbishop of Newark =Appointment and tenure= On November 7, 2016, Pope Francis named Tobin the Archbishop of Newark, a city which has, like Indianapolis, never before been headed by a cardinal. He was installed there on January 6, 2017. Tobin is a strong advocate of increased acceptance of migrants into the United States and of a lenient position towards those who are in the country illegally. In March 2017, he accompanied 59-year old Catalino Guerrero to his deportation hearing. The following May, Tobin called on Catholic leaders to resist the immigration positions of Donald Trump, saying, \\"you really have to believe in inflicting cruelty on innocent people to choose to support the policies we‚Äôve seen in recent months.\\" Tobin has been a major proponent of increasing the role of women in the Catholic Church. In an interview with The New York Times published on December 22, 2017, Tobin said that he \\"understand[s] the consternation\\" among women who find themselves frustrated that they are not permitted to become priests. When asked about the possibility of a female cardinal, he responded, \\"Maybe my theology isn‚Äôt sophisticated enough, but I don‚Äôt believe that there‚Äôs a compelling theological reason why the pope couldn‚Äôt name a woman cardinal.\\" =LGBT issues= Tobin welcomed a \\"pilgrimage\\" of gay and lesbian Catholics and their families to the archdiocese's cathedral in 2017. In an interview before the Mass, Tobin said, \\"The word I use is ‚Äòwelcome.' These are people that have not felt welcome in other places. My prayer for them is that they do. Today in the Catholic Church, we read a passage that says you have to be able to give a reason for your hope. And I‚Äôm praying that this pilgrimage for them, and really for the whole church, is a reason for hope.\\" In an interview with NBC's Anne Thompson on April 17, 2019, Tobin said: \\"The Church, I think, is having its own conversation about what our faith has us do and say with people in relationships that are same-sex. What should be without debate is that we are called to welcome them.\\" Tobin was then asked about language in the Catechism of the Catholic Church that refers to homosexuality as \\"intrinsically disordered.\\" Tobin answered, \\"Well I don't call them ‚Äòintrinsically disordered ... It's very unfortunate language. Let's hope that eventually that language is a little less hurtful.\\" Tobin supported the 2017 book called Building a Bridge, by Fr. James Martin, SJ, which called for the Church to modify its relationship with LGBT people. Tobin commented that \\"in too many parts of our church LGBT people have been made to feel unwelcome, excluded, and even shamed. Father Martin‚Äôs brave, prophetic, and inspiring new book marks an essential step in inviting church leaders to minister with more compassion, and in reminding LGBT Catholics that they are as much a part of our church as any other Catholic.\\" =Clergy sex abuse= On August 17, 2018 the Catholic News Agency reported that six Newark priests alleged experience of sexual misconduct by two priests in seminary and ministry in the archdiocese. Tobin responded with a letter to the priests of Newark on the same day, saying that he had been unaware of the issue. He concluded the letter by encouraging priests to refer media inquiries to the archdiocesan director of communications. On August 25, 2018 Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan√≤, former apostolic nuncio to the United States, released a letter describing a series of warnings to the Vatican regarding alleged sexual misconduct by then- cardinal Theodore McCarrick, a predecessor of Tobin in Newark. Vigan√≤ claimed that McCarrick \\"orchestrated\\" the appointment of Tobin as Archbishop of Newark. Tobin denounced Vigan√≤'s statement for \\"factual errors, innuendo and fearful ideology.\\" He said that the letter \\"cannot be understood as contributing to the healing of survivors of sexual abuse\\" and called for \\"guaranteeing a safe and respectful environment where all are welcome and breaking down the structures and cultures that enable abuse.\\" One journalist claims that in a conversation with Tobin that he said that around the time he came to Newark in 2016 he heard \\"rumors\\" about McCarrick having slept with seminarians, but chose not to believe them, stating that at the time they seemed too \\"incredulous\\" to be true.

Malli Amman Durgham  History  Named after Malli Amman a powerful deity, this village has over 110 houses and 75 families. There is evidence that the village has existed for at least two centuries. The evidence includes gun licenses issued by the British Raj and evidence that patas were supplied to the people of Malli Amman Durgham. A popular folktale in the area recalls how a stingy Naicker (caste) covered the crops with caps to deprive birds of their food and hence were cursed by the god Malli Amman. The curse brought great difficulties to the Naicker who ultimately went, with other members of his family, into a deep forest and never returned (probably a way of committing suicide by feeding themselves to wild animals). Therefore the people now do nothing to prevent birds and animals from consuming their produce. In fact, 70 percent of their crops are damaged by elephants and wild boars.  Geography  Altitude : 1264 metres above sea level. Northing Line (latitudinal distance) : 11¬∫35‚Äô 02.3\\" Easting Line (longitudinal distance) : 77¬∫20‚Äô 23.8\\" The village is mostly secluded as one needs to trek at least 9 km on foot over steep mountainous terrains where wildlife is abundant. The villagers need to trek to Kadambur, another village, or to Kemma Naicken Palayam (KN Palayam), both equidistant, to buy even basic things like matchboxes and provisions. There is a sharp division in the composition of forests on either sides of the mountains on which the village is situated. The southern side (towards KN Palayam), which is a rain shadow area, consists mostly of dry deciduous forests whereas the northern side (towards Kalkadambur), which receives most of the rainfall, consists of thick rainforests and provide a canopy. The short stretch of ‚Äòshola forest‚Äô (virgin forests, unaltered by human beings) is also found just above the village. A jeep and a pick up truck regularly ply these days on the treacherous road, to and from Kadambur to enable residents to travel and take things up and down.  Social composition  All people of the village belong to the same caste ‚Äì Malai Vellala Gounders. This caste is considered as a Backward Class and is not provided Scheduled Tribe Status. Hence many government schemes sanctioned for the welfare of the people in Tribal Settlements do not benefit these people. Many have moved out of the village in search of better amenities and opportunities. Over 250 families lived there a decade ago, of which only 65 are left.  Occupation  The community here is agro based and depend mostly on locally cultivated ragi and broad beans. These produce are not sold and kept for own consumption. Village also has abundant Guava and Jack Fruit trees. Villagers carry these on heads to Kadambur and KN Palayam for selling. Many families move out during the seasons of cultivation to work as labourers in fields, and return when agricultural works are thin. Recently the government has provided them permission to cut wild grass and make brooms they sell at a fixed price.  Development  The government had earlier provided electric current facility through wooden poles which lit 2 lamps in the village. But these wooden poles were burnt down due to a forest fire 25 years ago, and since then no electricity was accessible to the people here. The Special Task Force (STF) of Tamil Nadu situated in Sathyamangalam had provided with two Solar Street Lamps before 5 years, when the hunt for the forest brigand Veerappan was at its peak. They also obtained permission to lay an approach road to the village but after the killing of Veerappan, the STF stopped visiting the village. Since then the lights were unattended and have malfunctioned. The road project resumed after a temporary halt, with the consent from the then District Forest Officer Mr. Ramasubramaniam IFS. However, nature activists have claimed that the attempts to lay road is a part of the illegal efforts by outsiders to deprive the natives of their lands and setup commercial resorts and farms, which may prove destructive to the wildlife and the forests. The issue was reported in the Times of India on 17 May 2013. Recently, the villagers have also jointly purchased a diesel run electricity generator to light the village and play loudspeakers during festivals. It is also used occasionally to charge mobile phones and torch lights ‚Äì which are the new arrivals to the village. Almost every home today has a solar panel and a battery to power three lights.  Flora and fauna  Pachyderms, wild boars and bears are a common sight for the people of village, who also recall the instances of sighting leopards occasionally. Theku (Teak wood) and Nellikkaai (Indian gooseberry) are found in large numbers in the area. A number of fig trees (whose description the author does not know), quite a variety of shrubs and herbs are also found in the forest. Flora and to a major extent aviary surveys are yet to be carried out to document the plant and birds species in the area.

They form the western edge of the North York Moors but are separated from the moors by the valley of the River Rye. They are the eastern boundary of the low-lying Vale of Mowbray which they abut with a precipitous escarpment. They run in a north‚Äìsouth direction for about and merge with the Cleveland Hills in the north and Howardian Hills in the south. The hills are made up of rocks of middle and late Jurassic age with the hard Corallian Limestone forming the cap at the highest points. The highest point is Black Hambleton which rises to 1,308 feet (400 m) at the northern end of the range. Roulston Scar reaches 919 feet (280 m) and Whitestone cliff is 1,063 feet (324 m). The Corallian Limestone also outcrops along the southern edge of the North York Moors forming the Tabular Hills which run from Black Hambleton eastwards to Scarborough, although much broken through by river valleys. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Hambleton Hills was the production centre for York Glazed Ware, a type of Medieval ceramic.Jennings, S. 1992. Medieval Pottery in the Yorkshire Museum, York, 18-21. Points of interest Whitestone Cliff near Sutton Bank, western slope of the Hambleton Hills Sutton Bank (aka Roulston Scar) is a high point on the Hambleton Hills with extensive views over the Vale of York and the Vale of Mowbray. The hill is the site of one of the most important prehistoric monuments in the region, an Iron Age hill fort built in around 400 BC. The Hambleton Drove Road runs along the summit of the hills, it is part of an ancient highway running from Scotland to the south of England. It is thought to be prehistoric and various burial grounds from the Neolithic and Bronze Ages are evident along its route. Large-scale movement of cattle from Scotland to market in England during the 18th and 19th centuries have given it the name by which it is known today. The Pass of Byland was seized in 1322, by the invading army of Scotland's Sir James Douglas \\"the Good\\", Lord of Douglas, in the Battle of Old Byland which ended in the defeat of the English king Edward II's army.

Hambleton Royal Gold Cup A horse race was run at Black Hambleton from at least the time of Queen Anne. Known as the Hambleton Royal Gold Cup, it was open to all horses 5 years or younger and was raced for over , each horse carrying . The first race was won by the stallion Syphax, owned by Sir William Strickland. The race was traditionally held on the Saturday preceding the August York race meeting. The race was run until 1776 at Black Hambleton, thereafter alternately at Black Hambleton and the Knavesmire in York, and eventually, by the mid-19th century exclusively at York. The training of racehorses continued at stables at Hambleton House and the nearby hamlet of Hambleton.

It is situated about 1 km east of Ferryhill, between the East Coast Main Line railway and the A1(M) road. The site has one of the most important expanses of primary magnesian limestone grassland in Great Britain. In particular, it has the largest area of the grassland type which is characterised by blue moor- grass, Sesleria albicans, and small scabious, Scabiosa columbaria. The eastern part of the site is undisturbed grassland which, as well as species commonly associated with magnesian limestone, has a small population of the locally rare mountain everlasting, Antennaria dioica, and good populations of dark-red helleborine, Epipactis atrorubens, and perennial flax, Linum perenne subsp. anglicum, both of which are nationally scarce. The western part of the site has been disturbed by quarrying and the vegetation here consists of primary turf that was translocated between 1982 and 1990. Although it remains rich in herbs, the characteristic features of magnesian limestone grassland were lost during the translocation: blue moor-grass is uncommon, while coltsfoot, Tussilago farfara, and field sow-thistle, Sonchus arvensis, which entered the grassland during translocation, persist. The area supports a diverse invertebrate fauna, which includes the nationally rare least minor moth, Photedes captiuncula, the nationally notable Durham argus butterfly, Aricia artaxerxes salmacis, and the common glow-worm, Lampyris noctiluca.

It forms meadows in shallow sandy or muddy locations in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Description Thalassia testudinum is a perennial grass growing from a long, jointed rhizome. The rhizome is buried in the substrate deep, exceptionally down to . Some nodes are leafless but others bear a tuft of several erect, linear leaf blades. These are up to long and wide and have rounded tips. The flowers grow on short stalks in the axils of the leaves and are greenish-white, sometimes tinged pink, and are followed by seed pods. Distribution and habitat Thalassia testudinum up close Seagrass bed with dense Thalassia testudinum and immature queen conch) Thalassia testudinum with sponge and anemone Turtle grass grows in meadows in calm shallow waters throughout the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and as far north as Cape Canaveral in Florida. Extensive meadows can be formed on muddy sand, and coarse sandy and clayey seabeds, especially those with a calcareous content. This grass favours high-salinity waters with low turbidity, such as calm lagoons. It cannot grow in fresh water but some growth is possible at a salinity of 10 parts per thousand. The plant's preferred salinity range is 25 to 38.5 parts per thousand with a temperature range of . It is found from the low-tide mark down to depths of , depending on water clarity. It often grows in meadows with other seagrasses where it is the climax species. Its temporal range spans from the Middle Eocene to present. Reproduction Turtle grass can reproduce both through vegetative and sexual reproduction. The main propagation method is by extension of the underground rhizome, or stem. This increase in rhizome length results in asexual ramets, or clonal colonies which are genetic replicates of the parent plant. Although asexual propagation results in an increase in the size of the turtle grass bed, extensive asexual reproduction limits genetic diversity and can put the meadow at severe risk if there is a disease outbreak. It has been found that where plants have been damaged mechanically, such as by the propellers of boats, the cut ends of rhizomes are unable to grow and holes may develop in the turtle grass meadow. Turtle grass can also sexually reproduce through the production of underwater flowers and hydrophily. Turtle grass is dioecious, which means that there are separate male and female plants, each which produce an imperfect flower containing only one sex. Sexual reproduction takes place from April to July depending on location, though flowering has been observed during warm winters in Tampa Bay, Florida.Zieman JC. 1975.

Meso- fauna foraging on seagrass pollen may serve in zoophilous pollination. Marine Ecology Progress Series. 469: 1-6. The following morning, female flowers open. There are two methods of pollination: hydrophily and biotic pollination. In hydrophilic pollination, the pollen grains are carried through the water column by tides or currents and deposited upon an open pistillate flower. Underwater video cameras have more recently revealed crustaceans, polychaetes, and amphipods swimming towards open male flowers. These creatures were attracted to the seagrass‚Äôs nutritious mucilage‚Äîa carbohydrate-rich substance that houses pollen. As the invertebrates feed on the mucilage, excess pollen grains stick to their bodies. They move from flower to flower, feeding and spreading the pollen from male to female. Seeds begin to develop in about 2‚Äì4 weeks if fertilization occurred. Female turtle grass fruits develop into green capsule about 20‚Äì25 mm in diameter and can include 1-6 small seeds. After about 8 weeks of growth, the fruit undergoes dehiscence (botany), which releases neutrally buoyant seeds into the water column. If an event occurs producing significant water turbulence, an immature fruit may break off from the peduncle. This buoyant fruit acts as a transportation vessel as it continues to develop. The fruit will moved around by wind, currents, and tides until it eventually splits open to release the negatively buoyant seedlings into a new area. If the new location has favorable environmental conditions, the seedling will begin to grow. This is one way viviparous seedlings can start new patches of seagrass. Ecology Turtle grass and other seagrasses form meadows which are important habitats and feeding grounds. Associated seagrass species include Halophila engelmannii and Syringodium filiforme. Many epiphytes grow on the grasses, and algae, diatoms and bacterial films cover the surface of the leaf blades. The grass is eaten by turtles, herbivorous parrotfish, surgeonfish, and sea urchins, while the leaf surface films are a food source for many small invertebrates. Decaying turtle grass leaves are responsible for the majority of detritus in meadow areas. This grass is subject to periodic dieback episodes in the Florida Bay area. One such episode in 1987 killed off a large proportion of the plants and the resulting increased sedimentation and greater growth of epiphytes on the remaining plants caused a secondary dieback event. The areas affected have since been reseeded and planted with rhizomes and have recovered. In general, the population of this grass is stable. Rhizomatous green algae in the genus Caulerpa often live among the grasses and many animal make seagrass meadows their home. These include bivalves and other molluscs, polychaete worms, amphipods, juvenile fish (which hide among the leaf blades), sea urchin, crabs, and caridean shrimps. Relationship to humans Along with Thalassia hemprichii (which shares its common name with Thalassia testudinum), turtle grass makes its way into the aquarium trade and it may be cropped at 12 in/30 cm.(2012): Beautiful Seagrasses ‚Äì Keeping True Flowering Plants in Your Marine AquariumReefland.com. .

It comprised a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosives, and once in place this could be used to instantly create an anti-tank obstacle or to ruin a road or runway thereby denying its use by an enemy. Inception In November 1939 Lieutenant-General Andrew McNaughton travelled to Toronto for a meeting with Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Hertzberg (Commanding Royal Engineers, CRE) and Lieutenant-Colonel Guy R. Turner, both of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, Oliver Hall of the Mining Association of Ontario, and Colin Campbell, an experienced mining and construction engineer and Minister of Public Works under Ontario Premier Mitchell Hepburn. The meeting participants discussed military possibilities raised by experimental diamond drilling, an initiative that had been broached by R.A. Bryce, president of the Ontario Mining Association, among others. McNaughton recognized the possibility of placing explosives under fortifications or introducing poison gas into them for military use. As he prepared Canadian forces for departure to Britain, McNaughton proposed that a section of the 12th Field Company, Royal Canadian Engineers should be formed from experienced diamond drillers. He said: \\"We will start in a small way to see what is in the scheme and then expand if the results warrant it\\". McNaughton offered the command to Colin Campbell. Campbell accepted and initiated plans to obtain recruits from the mining districts of northern Ontario. McNaughton, now General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division travelled to Britain with his staff and the bulk of his division in December 1939. Early in January 1940 McNaughton inspected the Allied defences in northern France and on a four-day inspection of the Maginot Line he found defences to be unsatisfactory. He requested - and received - working drawings of fortifications so that his diamond drillers could help clear out German defenders if they captured portions of these areas. At a meeting with senior British engineers at Aldershot, McNaughton suggested that the pipes might be used to construct surprise obstacles in front of a German advance. This would be accomplished by pushing pipes into the ground at a shallow angle and packing them with explosives ready to be detonated. The pipe could be easily and quickly pushed by a hydraulic jack fitted to a tank transporter, numbers of which were available. According to McNaughton's biographer, John Swettenham, he got the idea of using hydraulic jacks from the bootleggers of Windsor, Ontario who, during the prohibition, pushed pipes from a brewery to other premises where drink could be safely loaded. Development Colin Campbell and his section of diamond drillers arrived in England in February 1940. They started experimenting in a quarry near Aldershot. Campbell proved that his section could produce surprise obstacles that could not be crossed by a tank during a demonstration at Bourley Hill. Attendees promised to support McNaughton's proposal to expand the section into a tunnelling company. In May 1940, McNaughton assigned the tunnelers a role in preparing defences in England and in May advised the War Office that \\"the detachment of 1 Canadian Tunnelling Company, intended for experimental work in France, should not now be sent but should be held for more important experimental work in England.\\" With the fall of France, the tunnellers were employed in anti-invasion measures. McNaughton noticed that ditches were being dug across unused airstrips to deny their use by the enemy even though the bombing of active airfields might make them urgently needed in the near future. By 18 June the Chief Engineer, Home Forces and the Inspector General of Fortifications were convinced of the benefits of the pushed pipes filled with explosives and set out to acquire large quantities of pipe for the purpose of destroying runways at short notice. By the end of that month the tunnellers successfully demonstrated \\"surprise\\" anti-tank obstacles near Shornmead Fort, Chatham. The drills and pipe pushing machines were used to bury a series of diameter pipes, each at a shallow angle to a maximum depth of about . Each pipe was about long and they were placed at intervals of in an overlapping pattern such that the lower end of the first pipe would end up about 15 feet underground; the next pipe would then be pushed into the ground behind the first so that the upper end of that pipe would overlap with the lower end of the earlier pipe. The pipes were packed with explosives which when detonated would produce a very effective anti-tank obstacle about wide and deep with loose soil at the bottom. This ditch would be sufficient to either stop a tank altogether or to force it be exposed to anti-tank weapons for several minutes as it effected a crossing. Pipe pushing machines were used to drill into the approaches to bridges or embankments and left ready for instantaneous demolition. Originally known as the Canadian Pipe Mine, it was later named the McNaughton Tube Tank Obstacle in honour of the commander of the Canadian Corps, Lieutenant-General Andrew McNaughton. On 9 August 1940, \\"McNaughton's secret A/T obstacle\\" was demonstrated to General Alan Brooke, Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, and, as such, responsible for defence of the UK. By October 1940, the Canadian engineers were in demand, and plans being made to train additional British units to install the devices. 179 Special Tunnelling Company of the Royal Engineers was formed, and about of the obstacle were installed ‚Äì requiring some 90 tonnes of explosives.  Tactical use  A secret report emphasised the value of this obstacle: Conventional anti-tank obstacles were very obvious from the air. These pipe mines had the advantage of being virtually invisible from the air and so could be used when the enemy had been coaxed into a seemingly weak point in the defences. Furthermore, the mines could be set in place without interference to the normal use of the land and so they were deployed under roads and railways that might need to be blocked in an instant, and runways that may need to be denied to the enemy at short notice.  Problems  McNaughton tubes were found to have significant defects. Blasting gelatine explosives were expected to remain potent for several years, but in 1941 it was evident that the explosives in some of the tubes had been affected by water, losing power significantly. A brass spearhead on a long rod was provided for withdrawing the explosives from the tubes, but in some cases the explosive had deteriorated into a porridge- like mush. Second Lieutenant Cameron, who as a civilian was an experienced oil drilling engineer, suggested washing out the explosives with water delivered by a narrow diameter tube pushed down the main pipe. The mush, along with globules of nitro-glycerine, was caught in burlap bags for disposal. The original pipes were then re-charged with stable explosives. After the end of the war Canadian pipe mine installations were removed. However, a small number were missed and rediscovered many years later. It was necessary to deal with discovered mines with great care. In April 2006, 20 unexploded pipe mines were discovered under a runway at a former Royal Navy air base, HMS Daedalus, Lee- on-Solent, Hampshire. The original 265 mines were each long. The 20 discovered mines were packed with of explosive. Their removal, thought to be the largest of its kind in peacetime Britain, led to the evacuation of some 900 homes staggered over a 5-week period. The mines were destroyed by controlled explosion.

He succeeded John Taylor, who now takes up the title of Immediate Past President. The President-elect is Louise Pryor. Research and member support Actuaries work in a number of different practice areas: enterprise risk management, finance and investment, general insurance, health and care, life insurance and pensions. Each of these areas is supported by an executive committee which oversees the development of knowledge and research within its own area, provides members with CPD opportunities and takes forward a programme of practice-specific research. The committees also foster a sense of community among actuaries practising in their particular field of expertise.Acuarial Profession. *Enterprise risk management - helping companies understand and manage risk in line with their business objectives *Finance and investment - for actuaries working in banking, corporate finance and investment *General insurance - rating products, advising on reserves and capital requirements, and similar general insurance activity *Health and care - a growing area in both the private and public sectors as health provision models evolve to meet changing needs *Life insurance - a traditional area for actuaries, with the roles evolving as life insurance itself evolves *Pensions - actuaries play a key role in advising companies on all manner of pension schemes and structures. Regulation The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries sets examinations, continuing professional development, professional codes and disciplinary standards. After the 2005 Morris Review raised concerns that the (then) Institute of Actuaries had failed to keep its syllabus and teaching materials up to date, the result of ‚Äòentrenched commercial interests‚Äô hindering the development of the Institute's education policy, Morris, D. (2005) Morris Review of the Actuarial Profession. Norwich: HMSO, March. the Review proposed a regime of independent oversight of the Institute's regulation of the profession by the Financial Reporting Council https://www.frc.org.uk/actuaries/oversight-of-the-actuarial-profession/morris- review. As a result, the FRC assumed responsibility for oversight of the actuarial profession and the independent setting of actuarial technical standards with effect from May 2006.Actuarial Profession. In 2018 the Kingman Review found that the FRC's oversight of the actuarial profession had not in practice proved 'an altogether effective arrangement'. It was based on a voluntary understanding, and the FRC had no powers with which to enforce 'any meaningful oversight of the IFoA'. https://www.actuaries.org.uk/news-and- insights/public-affairs-and-policy/kingman-review The UK Treasury, supported by the Government Actuary, told the Review they wished to see effective regulatory oversight of the actuarial profession. https://www.actuaries.org.uk/news-and-insights/public-affairs-and- policy/kingman-review, para. 23, and the Review recommended that the Government, working with the PRA and The Pensions Regulator (TPR), 'should review what powers are required effectively to oversee regulation of the actuarial profession'. Alongside this, a report by financial economist Kevin DowdEquity Release: A New Equitable in the Making Kevin Dowd and Dean Buckner, Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise in their Studies in Applied Economics series, December 3 2018. claimed that the Institute 'had allowed itself to be used as a mouthpiece for ERM industry leaders to broadcast their misunderstanding of their products in pursuit of their commercial interests' following a review by the UK Prudential Regulation Authority in 2018 concluding that firms investing in equity release mortgages were not properly reflecting the cost of the no-negative-equity guarantee. The UK satirical magazine Private Eye also carried a story alleging that the PRA's investigation had been delayed by 'years of lobbying' from firms including accountants KPMG and Ernst & Young, and by the Institute itself.11 January 2019 issue 1487 = Lack of Compliance with Equality Act 2010 = Complaints were submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission querying the two-tier charging structure's compliance with Equality Act 2010, which outlaws discrimination on the basis of nationality.

Public policy submissions =UK government's Shortage Occupation List= Shortage Occupation List background and purpose When occupations are placed on this list, UK employers have less restrictions for recruiting candidates directly from overseas; specifically from outside the EU. They would no longer need to complete a residency test, which involves demonstrating that a search for suitable candidates within the UK in the first instance has been unsuccessful. Actuaries added to the shortage occupation list In November 2011, actuaries were added to the UK government's Shortage Occupation List.Announcements The actuarial profession had argued for actuaries' inclusion on this list. Removal from shortage occupation list Actuaries were removed from the shortage occupation list in April 2013 following a consultation by the UK government's Migration Advisory Committee in January 2013. On this occasion, the actuarial profession made no submission either way; neither for nor against a shortage of actuaries. Statistics on shortage occupation list migrants Despite the actuarial profession advising a shortage of actuaries, freedom of information requests to the UK Border Agency (now superseded by UK Visas and Immigration) have revealed that only 19 people emigrated to the UK to work as an actuary via the shortage occupation list from 1 November 2011 to 12 March 2013. The countries of origin for these migrants were as follows: Australia (6), China (1), India (4), Malaysia (1), South Africa (5) and United States (2). The salaries of these migrants ranged from ¬£42,500 (actuary) to ¬£186,261 (chief actuary). The average salary was ¬£82,042. Despite Solvency II Directive work being cited as a reason for a shortage of actuaries, only one migrant had the description \\"Solvency II\\" in their job title.

Snower (born 14 October 1950) is an American-German economist, specialising in macroeconomic theory and policy, labor economics and the psychology of economic decisions in \\"caring economics\\". He is President of the Global Solutions Initiative, providing policy advice to the G20, and Professor of Macroeconomics and Sustainability at the German Hertie School. He is former president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and Professor of Economics at the Christian-Albrechts Universit√§t zu Kiel, where his labor and macroeconomic research showed that costs of adjusting employment, wages and prices play a central role in macroeconomic fluctuations. His psycho-social economics research indicates that economic decisions are driven by motives that depend on people's physical and social context. Life and career Snower was born in Vienna, Austria, where he went to the American International School. He received a BA and MA from New College, Oxford University, an MA and a PhD from Princeton University. He is a US citizen, married and has two children. He received German citizenship in 2018. He received a BA and MA from New College, Oxford University (in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, 1971), an MA and a PhD from Princeton University (1975). He served as Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland, before he moved to the Vienna Institute for Advanced Studies and then to BirkBeck College, University of London, where he became Professor of Economics. In 2004 he became President of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and Professor of Economics at the Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel. He held this position until he reached retirement age at the end of February 2019. He was succeeded by Gabriel Felbermayr. Snower was a visiting professor at many universities around the world, including Columbia University, Princeton University, Dartmouth College, the European University Institute, Stockholm University, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Tel Aviv. He has advised a variety of international organizations and national governments on macroeconomic policy, employment policy and welfare state policy. Work in the field of G20 and T20 During the German G20 Presidency 2017 Dennis J. Snower, together with Dirk Messner from the German Development Institute (DIE), were mandated to lead the Think 20 (T20), a consortium of think tanks from the G20 countries with the aim of supporting G20 decision- makers with research-based recommendations for action. Unlike other G20 engagement groups, such as Women 20 (W20), Business 20 (B20) or Youth 20 (Y20), the T20 does not represent a lobby group. From this commitment, Snower founded the Global Solutions Initiative, of which he is president today, and which offers policy advice, in particular for international institutions such as the G20 and the G7. Following the German G20 Presidency, the Initiative has held an annual summit in Berlin, Germany that occurs in the middle of the G20 calendar: The Global Solutions Summit aims to connect representatives of governments, international organizations and business as well as global civil society to discuss solutions to urgent global problems, while making a case for multilateralism and international cooperation. He is also the founder of the think tank association \\"Council for Global Problem-Solving\\" (CGP) which aims to develop policy proposals for the G20 and associated international organizations. Research in Labor Economics The insider-outsider theory of employment and unemployment, created by Dennis Snower in conjunction with Assar Lindbeck, explains employment and unemployment in terms of a conflict of interest between insiders and outsiders in the labor market. Insiders are employees whose positions are protected by labor turnover costs (such as costs of hiring, training, and firing, or costs arising when insiders cooperate with each other but not with outsiders). Outsiders enjoy no such protection. The chain reaction theory of unemployment, conceived by Snower together with Marika Karanassou and Hector Sala, views movements in unemployment as the outcome of the interplay between labor market shocks and a network of lagged adjustment processes. This theory indicates that cyclical and structural unemployment are interdependent. This implies that the lagged adjustment processes ‚Äì for example, current employment depends on past employment on account of labor market adjustment costs ‚Äì are shape both for the fluctuations in unemployment and the long-run unemployment rate. The theory on the reorganization of work towards multi-tasking, invented by Dennis Snower in conjunction with Assar Lindbeck, identifies driving forces underlying the shift from ‚ÄúTayloristic‚Äù organizations (characterized by specialization by tasks) to ‚Äúholistic‚Äù organizations (featuring job rotation, integration of tasks and learning across tasks). It was one of the first contributions analyzing the fundamental changes in the world of work arising from the digital revolution. Research on the psychological and social foundations of economics Caring economics, created by Snower in conjunction with Tania Singer and their respective research teams, laid the analytical and empirical foundations for a new theory of microeconomic decision making, based on underlying psychological motives. The analysis rests on the insights that all economic behavior is psychologically motivated (along the lines explained below), everyone has access to an array of discrete motivation systems, which affect their objectives, as well as their beliefs and perceptions, and which motive is active at any particular point in time depends on the person‚Äôs physical and social context. Together with George Akerlof and Steven Bosworth, Snower made seminal contributions to identity and narrative economics. This work explores the formation of competitive versus cooperative identities and the channels whereby narratives affect economic decisions. Snower laid the theoretical and empirical groundwork for a reappraisal of the Phillips curve ‚Äì the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment ‚Äì in conjunction with Liam Graham, Marika Karanassou, Hector Sala, Mewael Tessfaselassie and Andrea Vaona. This approach suggests that unemployment is not independent of inflation in the long run, but instead explores the circumstances under which there is an inverse long-run relation between inflation and unemployment. This theory calls into question the conventional claim that real economic activity is independent of monetary phenomena in the long run. The approach rests on the theory of ‚Äúfrictional growth,‚Äù focusing on the interplay between nominal frictions and money growth. This work breaks the conventional compartmentalization of macroeconomics into short-term macroeconomic fluctuations versus long-term growth. Snower developed new theories of sluggish price adjustment. With Assar Lindbeck, Snower showed how the sluggish adjustment of prices and wages in response to macroeconomic shocks depends on lags in the production process. The longer the production lags, the more slowly prices and wages adjust. With Steffen Ahrens and Inske Pirshel, Snower examined how asymmetric price sluggishness is generated by ‚Äúloss aversion,‚Äù the phenomenon that people are more sensitive to utility losses from price increases than to utility gains from price decreases. In conjunction with Wolfgang Lechthaler and Christian Merkel, Snower made seminal contributions to the macroeconomics under labor turnover costs. These contributions show how labor turnover costs help explain the persistent effects of macroeconomic shocks on aggregate output and employment, as well as strong amplification effects of real and monetary shocks on unemployment and the job finding rate. Dennis Snower was one of the originators of the macroeconomics of imperfect competition, as he was among the first to provide imperfectly competitive microfoundations for macroeconomic models. Together with Assar Lindbeck, he also made seminal contributions to our understanding of how macroeconomic shocks are transmitted to the labor market. Research on the economics of imperfect information The theory of ‚Äúhigh-low search‚Äù in product markets, which Snower created together with Steve Alpern, shows how firms use their pricing and product supply decisions to gain information about product demand under conditions of radical uncertainty. The analysis was also extended to the labor market to explain unemployment as an ‚Äúinformation gathering device‚Äù under uncertainty. Together with Alessio Brown and Christian Merkel, Snower created the incentive theory of matching. In contrast to the conventional theory of matching in the labor market, unemployed workers and vacant jobs are not matched through an arbitrary matching function, but rather the labor market matching process is analyzed as the outcome of a two-sided search process among workers and firms facing heterogeneous economic conditions. Research on economic policy Dennis Snower is the author of the benefit transfer program and other empowering labor market policies, whereby the unemployed receive jobs and training incentives in accordance with their needs. These policies redistribute economic incentives, not money, to the disadvantaged in the labor market. Thereby Snower became one of the earliest architects of active labor market policies. In the benefit transfer program, unemployment benefits are converted into hiring and training subsidies for the long-term unemployed. He also analyzed the implications of replacing current welfare systems by individualized welfare accounts. These accounts include retirement, employment, health and human capital accounts. Instead of paying the taxes to finance the welfare state, people are to make ongoing, mandatory contributions to each of their welfare accounts, covering their major welfare needs. Redistribution is achieved by taxing the accounts of the wealthy and subsidizing the accounts of the poor. As overarching theme for G20 policy making, Dennis Snower initiated the concept of recoupling economic and social prosperity, in interaction with Colm Kelly and Blair Sheppard. Recoupling policies are designed not only to reduce income inequalities, but also promote empowerment and social solidarity of people displaced by the forces of globalization and automation.

Tradition calls her a witch, a master of black magic. It is unknown who composed the story, but a manuscript of the Calon Arang text (written in the Latin alphabet) is kept in the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies. Story In the village of Girah in the Kediri Kingdom long ago, in what is now Indonesia, lived a very cruel widow named Calon Arang, a witch and a black magician. She had a beautiful daughter named Ratna Manggali. But because of her ruthless nature, the people of Girah are afraid of Calon Arang, and so, Ratna Manggali had no suitors. Knowing this, Calon Arang became furious, holding all of the people in the village responsible. She decided to place a curse on Girah, she performed a dark ceremony in the cemetery by offering the sacrifice of a young girl to Goddess Durga. Durga came down and granted the request of Calon Arang and the curse came true. A flood engulfed the village and took many people‚Äôs life. Afterward, many of the survivors became very sick with an incurable plague and died. Word of this finally reached to Airlangga, the King of Kediri, at the Royal Palace. After learning about the evil actions of Calon Arang, King Airlangga sent his army to Girah to kill her, but she was so powerful that the army had to retreat, many of the king's soldiers were also killed. Many days after pondering the situation, King Airlangga asked his advisor, Mpu Bharadah, for help. Mpu Bharadah sent his disciple, Mpu Bahula, to propose to Ratna Manggali. The marriage proposal was accepted, Mpu Bahula and Ratna Manggali hosted a marriage ceremony that lasted for seven days and seven nights. The celebration pleased Calon Arang very much as Ratna Manggali and Mpu Bahula also loved each other. Not long after, Ratna Manggali told Bahula that Calon Arang kept a magic scroll somewhere in her room and performed ceremonies in the cemetery every night. So, at midnight, Bahula went to the place where Calon Arang lived. That night, Calon Arang slept very deeply due to seven days and seven nights of partying in her daughter's wedding. Bahula succeeded in stealing Calon Arang's magic scroll, returned it to Mpu Bharadah, and told him all about Calon Arang's magic and ceremonies. Mpu Bharada told Bahula to go back to Girah before he was caught by his mother-in-law. Bahula invited his master, Mpu Bharadah, to visit him in Girah. Mpu Bharadah and Calon Arang met in the Girah village cemetery. Bharada asked Calon Arang to stop practicing her evil magic because it caused so much misery among the people. But Calon Arang refused to listen to Mpu Bharadah, and eventually, she fought a fierce battle with the Kediri soldiers. Because Calon Arang didn't have the magic scroll, she could not beat Mpu Bharadah. So, she loses the battle and died. When Ratna Manggali found out that her mother had died, she wept. Because despite Calon Arang's evil, she had always been good to her daughter. However, Ratna Manggali realized that her mother's death was for the best. Since then, the village of Girah has been happy and safe and secure. Interpretation and analysis In Balinese tradition, most often only focused on the fierceness and the evil deeds of Calon Arang. In historical perspective, Calon Arang and her demonic form Rangda were connected with the historical figure Queen Mahendradatta of Bali, who was a princess from Java and the mother of King Airlangga. Calon Arang was often portrayed as a fierce witch with a frightening face. However, a new perspective recently emerged which took Calon Arang's side and portrayed her more sympathetic and kindly. Toeti Heraty characterizes her as the victim of demonization within a patriarchal society, as a critic of a misogynistic culture and discrimination against women.

First discovered in 2010, TSPyV is associated with Trichodysplasia spinulosa, a rare skin disease only seen in immunocompromised patients. The virus causes hyperproliferation and enlargement of hair follicles by modulating PP2A protein phosphatase signaling pathways. TSPyV was the eighth human polyomavirus to be discovered, and one of four associated with human disease, out of 13 human polyomaviruses known as of the 2015 update to polyomavirus taxonomy released by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Structure and genome A map of the genome of TSPyV as described at its discovery in 2010. Subsequent work has indicated the possible presence of additional genes. Like all polyomaviruses, TSPyV has a circular double-stranded DNA genome of around 5.2 kilobases. The genome was originally reported to contain five genes in an organization typical of polyomaviruses, with the small tumor antigen and large tumor antigen genes located in the \\"early\\" region of the genome expressed early in the infection cycle, and the viral capsid genes VP1, VP2, and VP3 expressed from the late region. A subsequent study of gene expression during TSPyV infection identified messenger RNA consistent with middle tumor antigen, an early-region protein whose homologs had previously only been reported in polyomaviruses that infect rodents. Middle tumor antigen in mouse and hamster polyomavirus has been closely associated with these viruses' ability to cause tumors. The same study also observed evidence of an additional protein, called tiny T, and of an alternatively spliced form of large tumor antigen known as ALTO. Clinical manifestations Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a proliferative skin disorder that occurs in immunocompromised people and is considered benign, but can be disfiguring. It was suspected to be associated with viral infection on the basis of the patient population in which it appeared, and electron microscopy studies of clinical samples identified virus-like particles of a size and shape consistent with a polyomavirus. Unlike Merkel cell carcinoma caused mostly by Merkel cell polyomavirus, trichodysplasia spinulosa is a dysplasia rather than a neoplasia. TSPyV appears to actively replicate in the hair follicle inner root sheath cells; hyperproliferation of these cells is thought to underlie the clinically observable manifestations of the disease. Antiviral drugs such as valganciclovir and cidofovir have shown benefit in treating this disorder in case reports. Epidemiology As with most human polyomaviruses, TSPyV is a common asymptomatic infection in healthy adults. Estimates of seroprevalence - that is, prevalence of detectable antibodies against viral proteins - in immunocompetent adults range from 70 to 80% in different sample populations. TSPyV infects the skin, but viral DNA is rarely detectable there in asymptomatic individuals even if they possess antibodies to the virus indicating exposure. TSPyV has been associated with disease only in severely immunocompromised individuals, and then only in a small minority of those in whom the virus is detectable. Individuals with TS symptoms exhibit much higher viral loads than do asymptomatically infected immunocompromised individuals.

Denmark has a representative office in Ramallah. The State of Palestine has a semi diplomatic Mission with the rank of ambassador in Copenhagen. However, Denmark has not recognized Palestine existence and rights to sovereignty, therefore prohibiting actual relations and has somewhat antagonized the Palestinian Authority at times. Recognition of the State of Palestine On 29 November 1947, Denmark voted for the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, supporting the division of Palestine into two states. In December 2010, the Palestinian National Authority asked Denmark to recognize the state with its 1967 borders. In January 2011, Denmark with Norway said that they will soon recognize the State of Palestine, and on 9 March, Mahmoud Abbas visited Denmark for the first time, to discuss bilateral relations between Denmark and Palestine. During the visit, Danish Foreign Minister Lene Espersen stated that Denmark was not considering recognizing the State of Palestine. On 29 May, the Social Democrats revealed that if they win the next parliamentary election, they will recognize the State of Palestine. In August, it was still unknown if Denmark would vote no or yes for an Independent Palestinian state in the United Nations. On 15 September 2011, the Social Democrats won the 2011 Danish elections, and expressed support for the Palestinian membership in the UN, but waited for a joint decision in the European Union. On 22 September 2012, hundreds of Danes demonstrated in front of the Folketing. The Palestinian ambassador to Denmark said: \\"This recognition will enhance Danish-Arab relations and will reflect support of the Danish people for the Palestinian bid to UN\\". In October 2012, Denmark abstained from voting in the resolution for Palestine in the UNESCO. The Danish Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten) is a supporter of an independent Palestinian state, but no other party represented in the Folketing has Danish recognition of Palestine as its party line. Danish development assistance Denmark provides assistance to the occupied Palestinian Territories in the following three ways. * Denmark continues to participate in the peace process, promoting the Roadmap for Peace among other initiatives. The PLO‚Äôs Negotiations Affairs Department is on such peace building initiative which Denmark supports. * Denmark supports the creation of a sovereign, democratic, and peaceful Palestinian state. Denmark currently supports organizations which are bringing about the preconditions for these ideals, such as fighting corruption, increasing human rights, and ensuring free and fair elections. * Denmark seeks to improve the living conditions in Palestine through supporting private sector development. Denmark is currently supporting smaller local councils in the Jenin area through amalgamation and capacity building. An increase in economic integration between the West Bank and Israel is also a goal of the Danish. * In May 2017, the Palestinian Authority via its organisation Women's Affairs Technical Committee (WATC) named a women's center in the town of Burqa after Mughrabi and celebrated her as a role model. The center was built with the aid of the government of Norway and UN Women. The United Nations condemned the naming as \\"glorification of terrorism\\" and demanded its logo be removed from the building. The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs started its own investigations of WATC and found it had withheld central information about the naming of the centre and terminated the working relationship with WATC. As a result of the findings, the danish ministry also ceased its funding of 23 other NGOs in Palestine as of 1 January 2018.

Outline According to local myth, the creature is believed to be the manifestation of a person practising pesugihan babi black magic. Pesugihan is derived from the Javanese word sugih meaning \\"rich\\". It is a kind of magic to help people become rich instantly, but in exchange they must sacrifice something. In this case they must sacrifice their humanity; allowing themselves to be transformed into a boar for a period of time, or allowing themselves to be possessed by a boar demon. The human-animal transformation is similar to shapeshifting or the werewolf concept in the West. Transformation Some of the myths told about a man enveloped in black robes before miraculously turning into this creature. After the transformation, the demon boar roams around the village, scratching its body against the wall, door, cupboard, or furniture. Magically the belongings of the villagers, such as money, gold, and jewellery will disappear and be magically carried away by the Babi Ngepet. If the mission was successful, by the time Babi Ngepet safely returns home and transforms back into their human form, the black robes will be filled with the stolen money or jewellery. The person that practices Babi Ngepet black magic needs assistance from another person. The assistant's task is to stay home and guard the lit candle floating on a basin of water, while the Babi Ngepet is in action. If the candle flame is shaking, fading or almost out, it is the sign that the Babi Ngepet is in danger, caught in the act by villagers, or turned back into their human form. Because of this belief, Javanese villagers often chase or even kill any boar wandering around the village at night. Interpretation The skeptical view is that it was probably a traditional way to explain the unexplainable loss of fortune or a mysterious theft in the village, by blaming the wild boar roaming the village in the night. Or probably it was a means of traditional pest control; to get rid of wild boars from eating and destroying rice fields or barns. The association of the boar with magic concerning fortune probably originated from Javanese pre-Islamic and pre-Hindu-Buddhist beliefs that associate the boar with domestic richness, fortune and prosperity, similar to its connections with Celengan, which means piggy bank in Javanese. The word Celengan is derived from word Celeng which means boar.

TULRA both repealed and replaced the Industrial Relations Act 1971 which had been introduced by Heath's employment minister Robert Carr. The 1971 Act had faced massive opposition form the trade unions, whose industrial action contributed to Heath's implementation of the three day week and ultimately to the defeat of the government.

Kartu Mistis Indonesia This is a popular spirit that also appears in comics.Wewe Gombel comic Legend The ghost was named Wewe Gombel because it is related to an event that, according to ancient folklore, happened in Bukit Gombel, Semarang, where long ago a married couple lived. They had been married for years, but as time went by the husband realized that his wife was barren and stopped loving her. The husband became wayward, neglecting his wife and leaving her alone for long periods of time, so that she lived in sorrow. One day she followed him and caught him in a sexual relationship with another woman. Hurt by her husband's betrayal she became furious and killed him. Faced with the crime, angry neighbors gathered in a mob and chased her from the village. Despairing at the ostracization and continual harassment, she committed suicide. After death her vengeful spirit became Wewe Gombel. Sundanese folklore says that she dwells in the crown of the Arenga pinnata palm, where she has her nest and keeps the children she catches. She does not harm them and once they are under her clutches they are not afraid of her. Local traditions say that the children she abducts have been mistreated or neglected by their parents.

Description The greyish-brown cap is hemispherical when young, but later flattens out up to 10 cm in diameter. It is covered with broad scales. The gills are grey when young, and become much darker with age. The spores are chocolate brown. The stem is brownish, often with a hanging ring and a small bulb at the base. The flesh is white with a mild taste, turning reddish when cut. The young fruit bodies are well suited for consumption. Naming The species name sylvaticus (or silvaticus) means \\"of the woods\\". Both spellings are found in the literature, but Species Fungorum gives sylvaticus as the current name and so that version should be preferred. This well-known species was first validly described under the current name, Agaricus silvaticus, in 1774 by the early mycologist Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer. At that time most gilled mushrooms were all grouped under the genus Agaricus, but later were allocated to new genera which reflected their different characteristics. Now Agaricus has a much more restricted meaning, being the genus of the common cultivated mushrooms of Europe and America, but A. sylvaticus belongs to that group and has kept the same name during all that time. Similar species Agaricus haemorrhoidarius is normally considered a synonym, but has also been defined as a separate species, distinguished by its flesh which immediately turns red when cut. Agaricus phaeolepidotus is distinguished by a stem which yellows (in addition to turning pink) when cut. The cap background is browner than A. silvaticus and its smell suggests iodine or ink. Tricholoma vaccinum looks similar from above but has no ring and develops reddish-brown gills.

It traces its heritage to several Rochester congregations dating back to the 1820s. Richard Henn In its current form, it is the result of a 1934 merger of First Church and Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church. With a congregation of 2,300 people, it is the largest United Methodist church in the Rochester area. Asbury First presents an annual concert series featuring regional musicians and national touring groups. The Asbury First Dining and Caring Center serves meals to the homeless; the Asbury First Storehouse provides donated clothing, kitchenware, and bedding. The church also supports a Grocery Bag Ministry, Rochester Area Interfaith Hospitality Network, School 41 tutoring and outreach, and projects in India, Nicaragua, and Kenya. Located in the East Avenue Historic District, the church property features several historic buildings, including the 1953 Gothic Sanctuary, and 1050 East Ave., also called the Wilson Soule House, a stone edifice that is one of Rochester's finest examples of Richardsonian Romanesque style. History = Origin = Asbury First United Methodist Church is the result of the union of two churches and five denominations. The First Wesleyan Methodist Episcopal Church of the village of Rochester was formed in 1821. Asbury M.E. Church was formed in 1836 by Methodists who lived on the east side of the Genesee River. Both First and Asbury survived hard depressions in the 1840s and 1850s to remain strong influences in the city. A strong Sunday School was developed early, and has continually been a feature of Asbury, First, and Asbury First Churches. In 1866, Asbury Church purchased a pipe organ, the first Methodist Church to include instrumental music in a service. The building housing First Church burned in 1933. A few months later the First and Asbury congregations united. Campus Architecture The present church building was constructed in 1953-55 in the American Gothic style. The education wing was added in 1961. The stained glass windows were designed by George Haushalter. Democrat and Chronicle - Rochester, N.Y. The construction and style owes much to the dedication of Dr. Weldon Crossland, minister for 28 years.

McDonnell attended the public St. Paul's School, London (he later wrote a history of the school and its illustrious alumni). He went on to read medicine and then law at St. John's College, Cambridge, where he also served as president of the Cambridge Union Society. At the Union, Michael and his older brother T.F.R. McDonnell championed the Irish Home Rule cause. Both were also adamant supporters of women's suffrage and admission to Cambridge. After graduating from Cambridge McDonnell was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple. At that time he authored the book Ireland and the Home Rule Movement (1908), an attack on British policy in Ireland and a critique of Empire more broadly. McDonnell nevertheless went on to join the Colonial Service in 1911, serving in British West Africa for sixteen years. During his time in West Africa McDonnell served as Assistant District Commissioner in the Gold Coast, magistrate in The Gambia, and Attorney-General and Acting Chief Justice in Sierra Leone. He was appointed Chief Justice of Palestine in 1927. McDonnell was forced into early retirement in October 1936, towards the end of the first wave of the Arab Revolt, and replaced by Harry Herbert Trusted in January 1937. McDonnell's retirement was induced by a series of clashes with Palestine's High Commissioner, Sir Arthur Wauchope, over the role of Palestine's judiciary in suppressing the \\"disturbances\\". This clash culminated in McDonnell's ruling in the El Qasir v Attorney-General (1936) 3 PLR 121 case. The decision pertained to house demolitions scheduled to take place in the old city of Jaffa. Although McDonnell ruled that the government had the authority to demolish the houses, he deemed the government's reliance on town planning justifications, rather than military necessity, an act of moral cowardice and accused it of \\"throwing dust\\" in the public's eyes.Tom Segev, One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate, 2001, Tom Bowden, The Politics of the Arab Rebellion in Palestine 1936-39, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 11, No. 2 (May 1975), pp. 147-174Binyamin Blum, The Not Very High Standard of Credibility of Witnesses in Palestine: Perjury, Colonialism, and the Corroboration Requirement in Mandate Palestine Paper presented at the annual meeting of The Law and Society Association, Grand Hyatt, Denver, Colorado, 25 May 2009 After retiring from the bench and returning to London, McDonnell took up advocacy on behalf of the Arab cause in Palestine: he published a number of articles in which he attacked Britain's pro-Zionist policy in Palestine and in 1939, he was an adviser to the Arab delegation concerning the 1915‚Äì1916 correspondence between Sir Henry McMahon and the Sharif Hussayn of Mecca.Report of a Committee SET UP TO CONSIDER CERTAIN CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN Sir Henry McMahon AND The Sharif of Mecca IN 1915 AND 1916  References  External links * * Category:1882 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Mandatory Palestine judges Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:Chief justices Category:Irish judges Category:Irish barristers Category:Presidents of the Cambridge Union Category:People of the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine Category:Gold Coast (British colony) people Category:Gambia Colony and Protectorate judges Category:Attorneys-General of the Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate Category:Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate judges Category:Chief Justices of Sierra Leone ","title":"Michael McDonnell"},{"id":"28233134","text":"Tom Mansharov (; born 15 April 1987 in Tel Aviv) is an Israeli footballer who last played for Ironi Ramat HaSharon in the Israeli Premier League.

The myth is closely linked to prostitutes, meaning a \\"prostitute with a hole in her\\", in reference to the large hole which is said to appear in her back. Etymology The name \\"sundel bolong\\" derives from the physical appearance of the ghost. The word \\"sundel\\" which means \\"prostitute\\" or \\"whore\\" and \\"bolong\\" in Javanese which literally means \\"hole\\". Modern folklore studies believe that the myth was developed in Javan culture to deter prostitution that developed during the Dutch East Indies colonization. Mythology In folklore, a sundel bolong is the soul of a woman who died when she was pregnant outside of marriage and therefore gave birth in her grave, or who died during childbirth and the baby came out from her back (this is the reason why the hole was created in her back) which is concealed from men by her long black hair. The victims of sundel bolong consist mainly of men and children. As a vengeful spirit, if rejected by a man, she is said to castrate him. Children, especially newborns are said to be taken to replace her lost child.

Imprisonment Following the milk strike in September 1941, the Nazis took a tighter grip on society in general, usurped the Confederation of Trade Unions completely and installed Odd Fossum as new leader on 10 September. Tangen was arrested and imprisoned in Grini concentration camp from 10 September 1941 to 27 February 1942, and then at M√∏llergata 19 for one week. After his release, he fled to Sweden, where he played no political role. Ludvik Buland was imprisoned and died in Germany, whereas the head of the judicial office in the Confederation, Viggo Hansteen, was executed. Post-war After the war, in 1946, Tangen was excluded by the Congress of the Confederation of Trade Unions for collaboration. His personal secretary, Martin Brendberg, was excluded as well. However, Tangen was acquitted of treason by Oslo City Court in 1949, as a part of the legal purge in Norway after World War II. The court found that his degree of cooperation was acceptable.

At least 20 others were wounded in the attack. The rampage The rampage began when coal worker Li Xianliang (), who had been drinking and had a blood alcohol content of 154 milligrams per 100 millilitres, had an argument. Early reports said his first intended victim was a customer, whom he tried to kill. The customer escaped, but another nearby was killed as the rampage began. A later report said that the first person killed was the murderer's boss, with whom he had been arguing about money. During the incident, the attacker smashed into cars, motorcycles, buses, shops and trees. A passersby jumped onto the tractor, and one stabbed the driver in an attempt to stop the attack. The killer tried to attack the passersby with a crowbar and a brick before being subdued. At least eight of the victims died at the scene of the attack, while at least another three died in a hospital. The youngest victim was five years old. The rampage lasted for about an hour. Aftermath The attack followed unrelated attacks on schools elsewhere in China; the Chinese government removed some mentions of the incidents from the internet in China for fear that mass coverage of such violence can provoke copycat attacks. The various attacks on anonymous people and an attack on police have resulted in calls for better mental health care, as mental health problems often go undiagnosed and untreated in China. As a result, 550 new mental health clinics were opened and security was increased outside primary schools and nurseries all over China.

Michael was the eldest of Nicolai and his wife Valentina's two sons; they also had four daughters. Nicolai was offered a contract to tour the UK with the Bertram Mills Circus in 1930, which allowed him to bring his wife and their two elder children, Michael and his sister Helen, to England. The rest of the family joined them in 1934. Michael joined his father in the circus ring, clowning and stiltwalking. Many circuses were closed following the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, and during the early part of the war Michael was employed by the Ascot Gas Board to dig holes in roads, for ¬£2 16s 6d a week. Nicolai and his family succeeded in finding employment with the Blackpool Tower Circus after it was decided that it would remain open during the war. Michael and his sister Tamara appeared in each summer season until 1946, and toured during the winter months with stage circuses organised by impresario Tom Arnold. Bertram Mills Circus reopened in 1946, and the Polakovs rejoined it the following year. Michael and his younger brother, Sacha, performed alongside their father as augustes, and also developed a stilt-walking act with their sister, Sacha. During one performance in 1947, Michael saved the life of animal trainer Nicolai Trifonidis by rushing into the enclosure and dragging him free of the lions that were mauling him. Michael joined Billy Smart's Circus in 1951, and toured the US with the Mills Brothers Circus in 1953. He returned to the US in the late 1950s, performing under his father's name of Coco the Clown with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. He was hired by the McDonald's fast-food chain in 1966 to revamp the character of Ronald McDonald, for whom he designed the outfit and make-up still in use today. Michael also appeared in the first eight television commercials featuring the new character. Michael retired to Catlettsburg, Kentucky, with his second wife, Hazel, with whom he had one son and one daughter.

While he was still young his parents moved to Vienna, with the intention of educating him for the civil service, but against their will he entered Waldm√ºller's studio, and devoted himself to miniature painting.

Altona was at that time the second largest city under Danish rule and the railway line was the first built in Danish- controlled territory. Formation  =Background = Route choice: via Segeberg or Neum√ºnster Cover of \\"Essential companion for travelers on the King Christian VIII Baltic Railway between Altona and Kiel\\", published 1844 Altona station with the link line in 1890 The company was founded in December 1840 on the initiative of merchants from Altona and Kiel. Among the initiators in Kiel were Georg Hanssen and Johann Christian Kruse. The participants sought to improve the transport of their goods to markets by connecting the North and Baltic Seas and they agreed to promote this objective as members of the Altona-Kiel railway committee. In 1833, the economist Friedrich List had proposed a network of railways in Germany, including a rail link between the Hanseatic cities of Hamburg and L√ºbeck. In 1835, this proposal was rejected by the Royal Railway Commission, established by the King of Denmark, Frederick VI, as the heir to the throne, later Christian VIII, would only agree to a rail link between the Elbe and the Baltic Sea on Danish-only territory, for fiscal reasons. =Financing = Finance was raised as follows in 1844: *27.0%: Danish government *21.6%: Altona *19.2%: private investors *16.2 %: Kiel *13.1%: shares held by the Company *1.1 %: Neum√ºnster *1.1%: Altona Support Institute *0.4 %: Elmshorn *0.3 %: Pinneberg =Route selection = The English engineer George W. Buck was commissioned to plan the route. He came to the conclusion that in order to avoid hills the line should not pass through Segeberg but should instead run via Barmstedt and Neum√ºnster. As a result of the influence of Klaus Panje, Elmshorn offered to increase its shares in the enterprise if the line took a more westerly course, which a general meeting of the company agreed to in May 1842. Christian VIII issued the company a license for the line on 28 June 1842. The line‚Äôs termini would be built close to the respective ports. In the plan of 1844, other stations would be built in Pinneberg, Tornesch, Elmshorn, Wrist, Neum√ºnster and Bordesholm; and there would be halts in Stellingen, Eidelstedt, Halstenbek, Priesdorf, Horst, Dauenhof, Siebeneckskn√∂ll, Brockstedt, Pahdenstedt, Fohrde and Meimersdorf. =Construction and opening = Construction of the 105 km long line started in March 1843, originally as single-track except in Kiel, Neum√ºnster and Altona to let two trains in opposite directions pass. The chief engineer (in 1845 promoted to executive director of the company) was Edward Dietz, who had previously worked for the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden Railway Company. It was opened under the name of the Christian VIII Baltic Railway (Danish: Christian VIII √òsters√∏en Jernbane) on 18 September 1844, the birthday of the king, with a ceremony in the train hall of the not yet completed Altona station and the first rail service to Kiel (travel time: three hours). This was the first railway line in the Danish state. It was originally equipped with ten locomotives, eight tenders, 37 carriages and 50 freight wagons. The speed limit was 45 km/h during the day and 30 km/h by darkness. The rolling stock was ordered after an international tender. Five steam locomotives with an 1A1 wheel arrangement were built by the companies of Kitson, Thompson & Hewitson of Leeds and R and W Hawthorn of Newcastle. Tenders were built by W√∂hlert in Berlin. Carriages were supplied by R√∂he & Wienbarg of Altona. Parcel and freight wagons were supplied by Meyer of Uetersen, Knupper of Altona and Schweffel & Howaldt of Kiel. Schedule and time  The end points of the lines in Altona and Kiel were found have a time difference in exact astronomical time of about 40 seconds due to their location. Depending on what time was adopted a train between Altona and Kiel could be considered to have arrived nearly a minute too early or too late, even if it was really on time. To address this problem, the railway, in collaboration with the Altona Observatory and its director Heinrich Christian Schumacher, developed an artificial medium time for its timetable, reducing the maximum variation from true geographic time to 20 seconds, which was considerably less noticeable. This issue appeared with all railways as travel distances and speeds increased, finally leading to the convening of the International Meridian Conference in October 1884 in Washington, D. C., which agreed to adopt a universal day for astronomical purposes, eventually leading to the world being split into time zones, independent of precise astronomical time, including Germany‚Äôs adoption of Central European Time in 1893. Expansion of the railway network  Immediately after the completion of the main line, the construction started on a link between the low-lying banks of the Elbe and Altona station, which passed through the Altona Harbour Tunnel, known as the Schellfischtunnel (Haddock Tunnel). This line, which was opened in 1845, involved the haulage of wagons by cable up a 210-metre-long steep slope to overcome a height difference of 30 metres. The port railway in Kiel was opened to traffic on 1 September 1844. Also in 1845, the company expanded its network as it took over management of operations of the 34 km-long line of the Rendsburg-Neum√ºnster Railway Company (Rendsburg-Neum√ºnstersche Eisenbahn). While trying to purchase the lines of the English railway entrepreneur, Sir Samuel Morton Peto (the Flensburg‚ÄìHusum‚ÄìT√∂nning Railway Company), the AKE managed to purchase from him the valuable Rendsburg‚ÄìNeum√ºnster line on 1 January 1864. After that, Peto progressively reduced his business in Schleswig-Holstein and the AKE became its most important railway company. The company, together with the government of Hamburg, built the Hamburg-Altona link line and the former Klosterthor station, connecting the AKE‚Äôs line to the Berlin‚ÄìHamburg line near the former Berlin station and to the L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway‚Äôs L√ºbeck‚ÄìHamburg line near the former L√ºbeck station. Freight trains ran over the line from 30 September 1865 and passenger trains ran over it from 16 July 1866. On 31 May 1866, the almost 90 km-long Neum√ºnster‚ÄìAscheberg‚ÄìEutin‚ÄìNeustadt line (see Neum√ºnster‚ÄìAscheberg, Kiel‚ÄìL√ºbeck and Eutin‚ÄìNeustadt railways) was opened in east Holstein, including a local port railway and the connection from Ascheberg to Kiel via Preetz. On 10 December 1875, the 45 km-long Neum√ºnster‚ÄìSegeberg‚ÄìOldesloe line was added. The Altona‚ÄìBlankenese line was opened on 19 May 1867 and its 18 km- long extension to Wedel on 2 December 1883. In 1907, this line became part of the Hamburg-Altona City and Suburban Railway and in 1934, part of the Hamburg S-Bahn. =Share holdings = On 31 December 1862, the AKE took over operations of the Elmshorn‚ÄìGl√ºckstadt line, opened on 20 July 1845, from the Gl√ºckstadt-Elmshorn Railway Company (Gl√ºckstadt-Elmshorner Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft), founded in 1844. On 15 October 1857, the line had been extended to Itzehoe. From 1870 to 1884 the AKE managed the operations of the Schleswig Railway Company, which it did not own. The AKE was also significantly involved in the Oldenburg District Railways. It managed the operations, from the opening of the first line from Neustadt in Holstein to Oldenburg on 30 September 1881. The AKE also owned shares in the West Holstein Railway Company (Westholsteinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) and later acquired the Wesselburen‚ÄìHeide Railway Company (Wesselburen-Heider Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). Nationalisation As a result of the Second Schleswig War, Holstein became part of Prussia in 1867. In 1883 the Prussian government began to negotiate for the purchase of the Altona-Kiel Railway. Prussia took over administration and management on 1 March 1884 as the Royal Altona railway division (K√∂nigliche Eisenbahndirektion Altona), which moved into temporary premises in Altona. The company was purchase for 70.65 million marks by the Prussian State Railways on 1 January 1887 and the corporation was dissolved. Today the Hamburg-Altona-Kiel line is owned by Deutsche Bahn AG.

It only has 2 sections, from Bellville to Worcester and from Johannesburg to Polokwane. Western Cape The R101 starts in Bellville at the R102 and runs to the east parallel to the newer N1 freeway and is named Old Paarl Road. It goes through Brackenfell and enters Kraaifontein as Voortrekker Road. At the intersection with Maroela Road in Kraaifontein East it is renamed Old Paarl Road before entering the Cape Winelands. In the Cape Winelands it goes through Klapmuts and then enters Paarl. At the point where the R101 crosses to the northern side of the N1 south of Paarl, it is joined by the R45 to be co- signed for 6 kilometres northwards before separating from the R45 and turning right in Paarl Central Business District (CBD). It crosses the southern side of the N1, before it crosses the Drakenstein Mountains as Du Toitskloof Pass (820 m) where the newer N1 route bypasses as the Huguenot Tunnel. Through the pass it rejoins the N1 for 8 km until it separates again to provide access to the town of Rawsonville before it joins the N1 again at Worcester. The R101 designation is not used again up to Woodmead north of Johannesburg, Gauteng, which is 1300 km from Worcester. Gauteng and Limpopo A section of the R101 in Gauteng and Limpopo provinces connects Johannesburg with Polokwane via Pretoria, Bela Bela and Mokopane. The first part connects Johannesburg and Pretoria. It begins as Louis Botha Avenue (forming part of the Johannesburg Metropolitan Route which is designated as the M11), intersects with the R55 and the R564 near Woodmead (where it becomes the R101), and continues as Pretoria Main Road (later Old Pretoria Main Road) (east of the parallel Ben Schoeman Freeway, which is designated as the N1), passes through Midrand, and becomes the Old Johannesburg Road south of Centurion (where it crosses to the west of the Ben Schoeman Freeway, which is still designated as the N1), passing through the western side of Centurion, later changing names again to Jan Smuts Drive in Pretoria, where it merges with the northern endpoint of the Ben Schoeman Freeway (which is now labelled as the N14) at Potgieter Street (now named Kgosi Mampuru Street). It proceeds northwards through Pretoria Central as Kgosi Mampuru Street (one-way street) (and as Sophie de Bruyn Street, formerly Schubart Street, southwards up to the N14 Ben Schoeman Freeway), intersecting with the R104 Road during this time. At the junction with Struben Street, it becomes cosigned with the M4 Metropolitan Route of Pretoria eastwards up until Paul Kruger Street, where it turns north. While cosigned with the M4, it is Struben Street eastwards and Johannes Ramokhoase Street (formerly Proes Street) westwards (to the Struben Street junction from Paul Kruger Street). As Paul Kruger Street, the R101 goes north, passing the Pretoria Zoo, through Capital Park and Mayville. Just after Mayville, the R101 is co-signed with the M1 Metropolitan Route of Pretoria until the next junction, where the R101 becomes Lavender Road, the road separating Wonderboom South and Annlin West. At the next junction with Steve Biko Road (M5 Metropolitan Route's northern terminus), Lavender Road divides into Lavender Road West (for vehicles heading north, by way of a left turn) and Lavender Road East (for vehicles heading south) for about 1 km up to the junction with the R513 East (Sefako Makgatho Drive, formerly Zambezi Drive), where it becomes one road again northwards. An alternative, faster route from Pretoria Central to the M1 & R101 junction is using the M1 road, which bypasses to the west of the suburban areas of Capital Park and Mayville in a partial highway format (flying over some roads with off-ramp junctions) before reaching Lavender Road. Going north from the R513 junction, it intersects with the R566 Road (which connects to Onderstepoort) before flying over the N4 Platinum Highway. The R101, the R566 and the M1 form a Ring-Road around Annlin West (in-between Pretoria North and Wonderboom Airport). After crossing The N4, the R101 becomes Old Warmbaths Road and follows the Apies River north-north-east for 27 km, through Pyramid, to Hammanskraal. 6 km north of Hammanskraal, just before the Carousel casino, the R101 enters the North West Province for about 7 km before entering Limpopo. From Hammanskraal, it is parallel to the N1, passing through Pienaarsrivier. From Pienaarsrivier, the R101 makes a direct line for Bela Bela (Warmbaths) (35 km), where it meets the R516. The R101 continues by way of a right-turn at Potgieter Road in Bela Bela and the route makes a 27 km journey north-east to Modimolle (Nylstroom). As a straight road passing through Modimolle central, it intersects with the R33. After passing the Phagameng suburb of Modimolle, the R101 turns east towards the bypassing N1 Highway. At Middelfontein, right before the N1 Modimolle north off-ramp, the R101 becomes the road to the west of the N1 (Mookgophong Road, later Modimolle Road) heading north-east. After Kransvlei Farm Resort, the R101 continues by way of a left turn at the t-junction to become the straight road through Mookgophong (Namboomspruit). The distance from Modimolle to Mookgophong is 42 km. Passing through Mookgophong as Thabo Mbeki Street, it intersects with the R519 at Second Avenue and the R520 at Nelson Mandela Drive. While mostly parallel to the N1, it journeys 51 km north-east to Mokopane (Potgietersrus). 7 Km south of Mokopane, where it crosses the Mogalakwena River, the R101 Road cosigns with the N11 National Route, becoming Thabo Mbeki Drive, up to Mokopane Central. In Mokopane Central, next to Mokopane Mall, the R101 and N11 meet the R518 Road from Zebediela and cosign with it. At the 2nd junction afterwards, the N11 and the R518 become Nelson Mandela Drive (by way of a left turn), leaving The R101 as the straight road through Mokopane North (Thabo Mbeki Drive). After the Mokopane Game Breeding Centre, the R101 turns eastwards to cross the bypassing N1 Highway at its Mokopane North Off-ramp (Sebetiela Toll Plaza) and follow it north-east to Polokwane (60 km) while being on its eastern side. As there is a new Eastern Bypass of Polokwane given to the N1, the old road through Polokwane Central (Thabo Mbeki Street and Grobler Street), meeting the northern terminus of the R37, meeting the western terminus of the R71, turning north and bypassing Polokwane International Airport (Landdros Mare Street), has been given to the R101.https://www.nra.co.za/live/content.php?Category_ID=159http://za.geoview.info/polokwane_bypass,32938484w The point where Landdros Mare Street and the Polokwane Eastern Bypass meet north of Polokwane marks the end of the R101, as the road heading north to the towns of Louis Trichardt, Musina and the border of Beit Bridge with Zimbabwe is given back to the N1. (Here, the N1 no longer has a parallel road following it) R101 (Musina) As there is a bypass being built around the town of Musinahttps://reviewonline.co.za/287421/polokwanemusina-ring-roads-reduce- travelling-time-n1-gauteng-musina/ (west of the city centre), the N1 section through the central suburb of Musina, just like most other old sections of the N1, may be designated as the R101 once the bypass is complete.

Since 83% of the population is classified as elderly, the island's villages have been designated as a which means that with 50% or more of the population being over 65 years of age, the survival of the village is threatened. The majority of the people who live on the island are involved either in fishing or hospitality. The island is also known as Manga Island, as Shotaro Ishinomori planned to move to the island. There are manga-themed lodges on the island, resembling cats.  History  Tashiro Elementary School closed down in 1989 and was turned into an educational center. The educational center closed in 2008. Manga Island, a tourist facility, was built in 2000. A 6 km and 10 km race called Hyokkori Hy≈çtan Tashirojima Marathon was held in 2007. In 2011, the island was hit by the T≈çhoku tsunami. Survivor reports suggest extensive damage to some areas of the island, but the feline population appears to have survived relatively intact.  Feline population  In Japan's late Edo Period, much of the island raised silk-worms for their textiles. The residents kept cats to chase the mice away from their precious silk-worms. Over time, this cat population left un-neutered began to grow immensely while the human population dwindled down to fewer than 100 residents. As of today, the feral cat population outnumbers humans 6 to 1 on this small Japanese Island. However, the residents and thousands of tourists who flock to Tashirojima every year do not mind being outnumbered by their feline friends. In Japanese culture, cats are considered to bring good luck, said to bring money and good fortune to all who cross their path. Some even claim that it was the cats who kept the majority of the island from being destroyed during the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011.  Cat shrine  Cat shrine There is a small cat shrine, known as , in the middle of the island, roughly situated between the two villages. In the past, the islanders raised silkworms for silk, and cats were kept in order to keep the mouse population down (because mice are a natural predator of silkworms). Fixed-net fishing was commonly practiced on the island after the Edo Period and fishermen from other areas would come and stay on the island overnight. The cats would go to the inns where the fishermen were staying and beg for scraps. Over time, the fishermen developed a fondness for the cats and would observe the cats closely, interpreting their actions as predictions of the weather and fish patterns. One day, when the fishermen were collecting rocks to use with the fixed-nets, a stray rock fell and killed one of the cats. The fishermen, feeling sorry for the loss of the cat, buried it and enshrined it at this location on the island. There are at least ten cat shrines in Miyagi Prefecture. There are also 51 stone monuments in the shape of cats, which is an unusually high number compared to the other prefectures. In particular, these shrines and monuments are concentrated in the southern area of the island, overlapping with the regions where silkworms were raised.  Mentions in media  In 2004, a couple moved to the island from Sendai and opened up an inn for travelers called Hamaya. In 2006, they started a blog about the island and its inhabitants.Hamaya blog On May 20, 2006, Terebi Asahi filmed an episode of on the island, which mentioned the large cat population.

R. Rahman, who accompnied for the music and background score for the 2010 Indian Tamil film of the same name, written and directed by Mani Ratnam. The film marks Rahman's second collaboration with actor Vikram after Pudhiya Mannargal (1994). The soundtrack album was released by Sony Music on 28 May 2010. The soundtrack features six songs with lyrics penned by Vairamuthu, except for the song \\"Veera\\", which was penned by Mani Ratnam himself. The same soundtrack was used for the Hindi version of the film, titled Raavan, and the dubbed Telugu version of the film Villain, with the lyrics for the former was penned by Gulzar and the latter was penned by Veturi Sundararama Murthy, which is his last work before his death in May 2010. While the audio rights of both Tamil and dubbed Telugu version was released by Sony Music, the Hindi version was released by T-Series. While the album has six songs in total, five additional songs, which were featured in the movie was released as a collector's edition special pack on 10 November 2010. One of these tracks \\"Naan Varuvaen\\" was later released as a music video titled Changing Seasons. A. R. Rahman himself wrote the lyrics for this track and made an impromptu performance during the audio launch. The choreography of the songs were done by Ganesh Acharya, Brinda, Shobhana and Astad Deboo. The soundtrack is especially noted for the use of rich instruments, Indian as well as Middle Eastern. Several new singers were introduced through this film.  Track listing  =Tamil version= Collector's edition = Telugu version = =Hindi version= Additional tracks  Reception  The soundtrack for the movie has received positive reviews, with most reviewers hailing the album to be one of Rahman's best recent works, though it did not win any awards for the year. Ironically, most of the music awards were won by the soundtrack of another Tamil film, Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, which was also composed by Rahman. Karthik of Milliblog praised the renditioning of \\"Kalvare\\" by Shreya Ghoshal and stated that \\"Keda Kari\\" was \\"a fantastic effort\\". Music Aloud gave 8.5/10 to the album stating \\"Raavanan still makes for a great listen. It is, after all, a Rahman composition!\\" Behindwoods gave 3.5 out of 5 and summarised \\"The trilingual aspect of this movie seems to have steered Rahman into expressing himself a tad cautiously as far as Carnatic ragas are concerned. Nevertheless, this is a brisk and riveting album. The percussive aspect certainly deserves applause because of its muted nature. Though Karthik‚Äôs song looms large, all songs have the possibility of hitting the charts.\\" Rediff gave the same rating and summarised \\"Its always been said that an A R Rahman album takes more than a couple of listens to sink into and that holds good for Ravanan as well. The songs are geared more towards specific situations, emotions and characters; undoubtedly, their appeal is bound to the movie itself. Nevertheless, the range and depth of the numbers do impress you on repeated listens. A couple of numbers, you feel, don't scale the heights of brilliance; the transmutation from Hindi to Thamizh is obvious, and rather jarring at moments. But Rahman's brilliance in instrumental arrangement, choice of vocals and Vairamuthu's lyrics make up for it. It looks like Mani Ratnam has managed to shape a complex collection from his protege this time too.\\"  Album credits  Credits adapted from A. R.

At the 2006 census, its population was 446, in 154 families. it situated near the major Shi'i centres of Qumm and Kashan in Iran, to which the Nizari Ismaili Imamate was transferred during the late 14th century CE. Owing to the village‚Äôs name, Ismaili history between the 14th and 15th centuries is dubbed the ‚ÄúAnjudan period‚Äù. History of the Ismailis in Anjudan The earliest evidence of an Ismaili presence in Anjudan is in the late 14th century at the time of Tamerlane‚Äôs attack on the community.Virani, Shafique N. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.113. Various Persian historians including Mirkhwand and Khwadamir record that Anjudan was prepared for attack, with a village fortress and intricate tunnels. These however did not prevent Tamerlane‚Äôs troops from prevailing. Despite the forays of Tamerlane in the region, Mirkhwand has pointed out in the late 15th century, that the village of Anjudan remained Ismaili. =Factors leading up to the transference of the Imamate= While the precise rationale for establishing the Imamate in Anjudan is unclear, there are various factors that likely contributed to this decision. Earlier efforts by the Ismailis to reestablish at Alamut were unsuccessful and the failure to fully obscure their religious convictions with the practice of taqiyya created a dangerous environment for the community in the South Caspian region. Anjudan‚Äôs distant location from the major centers of Sunni dominance, Tabriz and Herat also made it advantageous for the Imamate to be situated here.Virani, Shafique N.. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.113. =Timur's Siege of Anjudan= In May 1393 Timur's army invaded the village of Anjudan. This crippled the Ismaili village only one year after his assault on the Ismailis in Mazandaran. The village was prepared for the attack. This is evidenced by it containing a fortress and a system of tunnels. Undeterred, Timur's soldiers flooded the tunnels by cutting into a channel overhead. Timur's reasons for attacking this village are not yet well understood. However, it has been suggested that his religious persuasions and view of himself as an executor of divine will may have contributed to his motivations.Virani, Shafique N. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p. 116. The Persian historian Khwandamir explains that an Ismaili presence was growing more politically powerful in Persian Iraq. A group of locals in the region was dissatisfied with this and, Khwandamir writes, these locals assembled and brought up their complaint with Timur, possibly provoking his attack on the Ismailis there. =The Imams at Anjudan= *Imam Mustansir bi‚Äôllah II/ Imam ‚ÄòAli Shah Qalandar Mustansir bi‚Äôllah II (1464-1480) (died 1480). The first known Ismaili Imam to have taken up residence in Anjudan was Mustansir bi‚Äôllah ‚ÄòAlishah, better known as Imam Mustansir bi'llah and locally as Shah Qalandar. His mausoleum in Anjudan, known to the family of the Ismaili Imams, was first brought to the attention of Western scholarship by one of the pioneers of the study of the Ismailis, Wladimir Ivanow. Imam Mustansir bi‚Äôllah II was the first Nizari Ismaili Imam to settle and live in the village of Anjudan. This Imam (or his mausoleum) was also known as Shah Qalandar, which is a common Sufi epithet since the name ‚ÄúQalandar‚Äù evokes the wandering spiritual guide who has no need for any spiritual guide himself. *Imam ‚ÄòAbd Al-Salam (died 1493). The successor to Imam Mustansir bi‚Äôllah, Mahmud ibn Mustansir bi‚Äôllah, also known as Salaam Allah is recorded to have once commented that ‚Äúcontentment was more important than conquest‚Äù. It was for this reason that Mustansir bi‚Äôllah bestowed his son with the title ‚ÄòAbd al-Salam, meaning ‚Äúservant of peace‚Äù.Virani, Shafique N.. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.120. His works include: Five Discourses (Panj Sukhan), Decree of the Imam ‚ÄòAbd al-Salaam (FarmƒÅn-i ShƒÅh ‚ÄòAbd al-SalƒÅm, and A Poem of Shah ‚ÄòAbd al-Salam b. Shah Mustansir bi‚Äôllah Bandƒ´ az ShƒÅh ‚ÄòAbd al- SalƒÅm [b.] ShƒÅh Mustan·π£ir bi‚Äôllah. *Imam Gharib Mirza/ Imam ‚ÄòAbbas Shah Gharib Mirza Mustansir bi‚Äôllah III (died 1498). Imam ‚ÄòAbbas Shah acquired the epithet ‚ÄúGharib Mirza‚Äù due to his exile (ghurba) on account of political opposition. His works include: From the Discourses of Shah Gharib Mirza (Min KalƒÅm-i ShƒÅh Gharƒ´b Mƒ´rzƒÅ) on the mystical import of the alphabet and a poetic composition on similar topics. The PandiyƒÅt-i JawƒÅnmardƒ´, which was also authored anonymously under a certain Imam Mustansir bi‚Äôllah also likely contains the teachings of the Imam Gharib Mirza, who was also known as Imam Mustansir bi‚Äôllah III.Virani, Shafique N.. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.126. The mausoleum of this Imam is known locally as ‚ÄúShah Gharib‚Äù and is still located in Anjudan today. Financial support was regularly sent by Aga Khan I and Aga Khan II to the Anjudan people, in the late 19th century. In addition the Imams conducted restoration projects of various monuments and buildings of sentimental significance in the region.Virani, Shafique N.. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.116. Notable Figures *Among the major exponents of literature during the Anjudan revival was a poet known as Da'i Anjudani, likely a high-ranking member in the Ismaili hierarchy (hud≈´d), and brother Mawlana Malik Tayfur Anjudani. *The fortress of Nurabad near Anjudan is said to owe its name to a younger brother of Imam Gharib Mirza, Nur al-din.Virani, Shafique N..

Work Environments The core ideology of the American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses (ASPAN) is to serve nurses \\"practicing in all phases of preanesthesia and postanesthesia care, ambulatory surgery, and pain management.\\"http://www.aspan.org/AboutUs/CoreIdeology/tabid/3145/Default.aspx The National Association of PeriAnesthesia Nurses of Canada (NAPAN¬©) promotes leadership to PeriAnesthesia nurses (from the PreAdmission/PreOperative Phase through to the Anesthesia Phase and all of the PostAnesthesia phases) in education, research and adapting to evolving practices in client and health services needs within the Canadian health care system. =Preoperative assessment= Nurses are responsible for a large amount of the assessment done in pre-operative clinics, where patients are evaluated for the ability to tolerate anesthetic and screened for factors which may affect the course of the anesthetic experience. = Post anesthesia care unit= Nurses provide extensive care to patients in the early stages of emergence from anesthetic and in the immediate post-operative period until they are deemed stable enough to safely transfer to other areas. = Ambulatory care= There is a large number of procedures that are performed on an outpatient basis where the patient is not expected to require hospitalization after the procedure. Examples include dental, gynecological, and diagnostic imaging clinics. =Pain management= Pain management nurses are sometimes considered to be perianesthesia nurses, given the collaborative nature of their work with anesthetists and the fact that a large proportion of acute pain issues are surgery related. However, distinct pain management certifications exist through the American Society for Pain Management Nurses. Training and Certification Both registered nurses and licensed practical nurses work in some perianesthesia areas. Beyond active registration in good standing, educational and specialized training requirements vary by jurisdiction and practice setting. Many institutions require specialized training in areas such as cardiac and invasive monitoring, administration of intravenous push medications, as well as CPR and ACLS. In the United States, RNs can receive specialty certification through the American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses (ASPAN) as either Certified PostAnesthesia Nurses (CPAN) or Certified Ambulatory PeriAnesthesia Nurses (CAPA). In Canada, the Canadian Nurses Association has recently added peri- or post-anesthesia nursing as a certified specialty with the first Certification qualification examination currently being offered (registration fall, 2013 with exam date April 5, 2014).

Founded by Sir Roger Wilbraham in 1613, they were the town's earliest almshouses. They remained in use as almshouses until 1870, when they were replaced by the adjacent Tollemache Almshouses. The timber- framed building, which is listed at grade II, was subsequently used as a malthouse and as cottages, and was later considerably altered to form a single house. The Hospital of St Lawrence, a medieval house for lepers, might have been situated nearby. Nikolaus Pevsner considers Welsh Row \\"the best street of Nantwich\\".Pevsner & Hubbard, p. 289 The street has many listed buildings and is known for its mixture of architectural styles,Bavington et al., plate 55 including other black-and-white cottages such as the Widows' Almshouses founded by Sir Roger's descendant, Georgian town houses such as Townwell House and number 83, and Victorian buildings such as the former Grammar School, Primitive Methodist Chapel and Savings Bank. History Acton, also founded by Sir Roger Wilbraham in 1613 Sir Roger Wilbraham (1553‚Äì1616) was a prominent lawyer who served as Solicitor-General for Ireland under Elizabeth I and held positions at court under James I. Born in Nantwich, he purchased the Dorfold estate in the adjacent parish of Acton in 1602.Latham, pp. 115‚Äì119Hall, p. 437 In 1613, Sir Roger founded almshouses for six poor men at what was then the end of Welsh Row; they were the town's earliest almshouses.Hall, pp. 126, 355, 358, 372 The Hospital of St Lawrence, a medieval house for lepers, is believed to have been situated near the almshouse site.Hall, pp. 53‚Äì54Lamberton & Gray, p. 12 Four of the six almsmen were to be chosen from Nantwich, and two from the parish of Acton. Each almsman originally received four marks (¬£2 13s 4d) annually (according to William Webb, five marks, or ¬£3 6s 8d), as well as a gown every two years. The same year, he also founded a pair of almshouses in the village of Acton.Lamberton & Gray, pp. 11‚Äì12Simpson, plate 113 The original Nantwich almshouse was: It might have been more similar to the existing appearance of the Acton almshouses than to the much-altered building surviving on Welsh Row. Webb described each almshouse in 1622 as \\"an handsome lodging\\" with \\"a little garden\\". The original wall by the street had a stone gateway; this is thought to have been moved to the garden of Townsend House (now demolished), the Welsh Row mansion of the Wilbraham family, and later to the grounds of Dorfold Hall. Tollemache Almshouses replaced Wilbraham's Almshouses in 1870 Before 1661‚Äì2, the Nantwich almhouses' endowment was increased by ¬£12 a year by Lady Grace Wilbraham of Woodhey. Wilbraham's Almshouses were maintained by the Wilbraham family until 1692, when responsibility for them passed into the Tollemache family because of the earlier marriage of Grace Wilbraham, the Wilbraham heiress, to Lionel Tollemache, the third Earl of Dysart.Blacklay, pp. 33‚Äì35Hall, p. 21 By 1774, the almsmen received 40 shillings and a pair of shoes annually, and a grey gown faced with blue and cap every two years. In 1856, the almshouses' endowment was considerably increased by a bequest of ¬£738 13s 7d from Elizabeth and Mary Bennion, sisters of the wife of St Mary's minister.Hall, pp. 306, 362Morris & Co's Directory (1874) In 1870, the Wilbraham's Almshouses were replaced by the adjacent Tollemache Almshouses, built by John Tollemache, a descendant of Sir Roger Wilbraham, on the gardens of the Wilbraham's Almshouses. The almshouse building was subsequently used as a malthouse, and in the early 20th century was known as The Maltkilns.Vaughan, p. 20 The original thatched roof was still present in 1907, when the building was divided into four two-storey cottages. By around 1930, the thatch had been replaced by corrugated iron, and the building was derelict in around 1971.Bavington et al., plates 59‚Äì60 The former almshouses have subsequently undergone substantial alterations to form a single house.

The bank was originally located at several addresses around Union Square in Manhattan before finally moving to 31 Union Square West, a 16-story Renaissance Revival building designed by Bruce Price and built between 1902 and 1903. The bank building uses a tripartite facade design and neoclassical elements. After the Bank of the Metropolis merged into the Bank of Manhattan in 1918, the building continued to be used as an office tower. The upper stories were converted for residential use in 1976, while the ground level was later used as a restaurant. The Bank of the Metropolis building was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1988, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.  History  = Bank establishment = Starting in the 1870s, the area surrounding Union Square Park became populated with hotels, theaters, and commercial enterprises. The Bank of the Metropolis was established on June 1, 1871, to serve the merchants around Union Square. The businessman William Steinway, of Steinway & Sons, was among the bank's founding board of directors. The Bank of the Metropolis was initially located at 31 Union Square West, at the site of the present bank building. At the time, most businesses were located in Lower Manhattan. The 1893 King's Handbook to New York City described it as a \\"flourishing outgrowth of the movement of business\\" further uptown. The bank moved twice during the 19th century: to 17 Union Square West in 1877, and to 29 Union Square West in 1888. During the first decades of the bank's existence, The New York Times described three criminal incidents involving the bank. In 1879, a nighttime guard went to a saloon to drink, leaving the bank without any protection, though no burglaries were reported during that time. A man was caught depositing forged bonds at the bank during the early 1880s, See also and a thief was arrested in 1889 after robbing a client who had just made a withdrawal. By the mid-1890s, the Bank of the Metropolis had $6 million in deposits. At the time, Union Square was being developed with such buildings as the Decker Building at 33 Union Square West, near the corner with 16th Street, and the Century Building at 33 East 17th Street, on the northern side of the park. By the beginning of the 20th century, the bank's board of directors included Louis Comfort Tiffany and businessman Charles Scribner II. The National City Bank acquired a major stake in the Bank of the Metropolis in 1900. = New building = The Bank of the Metropolis bought the plot at the corner of 16th Street and Union Square West. The plot had previously been occupied by a Brentano's bookstore, which moved elsewhere in 1901. The bank hired Bruce Price to design a 16-story building on the slim L-shaped lot. The land for the bank was adjacent to the Decker Building, directly to the north at 33 Union Square West, which had unsuccessfully attempted to sell the corner lot that the new bank building was to occupy. The bank started ordering stone for the new building in November 1901, and Price submitted his plans to the New York City Department of Buildings the next month. The structure was built by the George A. Fuller Company. During construction, the foundation of the Decker Building had to be underpinned because the foundation of that building was not located in solid rock. In August 1902, four construction workers were injured when one of the derricks broke. When the building was completed in 1903, it had cost $500,000 in total. Pitman's Journal of Commercial Education, one of the building's first tenants, praised the amenities and its proximity to the New York City Subway's 14th Street‚ÄìUnion Square station, which at the time was under construction. = Later use = The bank building was occupied by several office tenants, including architecture firm Jackson, Rosencrans & Caufield; architect Charles B. Meyers; the Employing Lithographers‚Äô Association; engineering firm W. L. Fleischer & Co.; and Jewish organizations.Miller, Tom (September 7, 2011). \\"Daytonian in Manhattan: The Bank of the Metropolis ‚Äì No. 31 Union Square\\". Daytonian in Manhattan. The Bank of the Metropolis was merged into the Bank of Manhattan in 1918, though the Union Square West building continued to be used as a banking location. Two years later, the building was sold to Dora Kuch for $2 million. The building remained relatively unchanged until 1975, when developer David Teitelbaum was granted a zoning variance to turn the upper-floor offices into 145 residences. These plans temporarily stalled in 1976 because several banks did not want to finance the $3.3 million conversion project. By 1979, the residential conversion had been completed: most of the building was used as artists' lofts, while four floors were being used as dormitory space for the Parsons School of Design. The former banking room at the ground floor was occupied by a restaurant, the Blue Water Grill, starting in 1996. p. 202 The restaurant closed in 2019 due to rising rents.  Design  The Bank of the Metropolis building is a Renaissance Revival structure with a facade made of limestone. Price was particularly attached to designing skyscrapers in three parts, mirroring the structure of classical columns, and the building reflects this base-shaft-capital concept. The tripartite design and the use of neoclassical elements are also present in Price's earlier buildings, including the American Surety Building (1896) and the demolished International Bank and Trust Company Building (1899). = Form = The Bank of the Metropolis building is located on a slim L-shaped plot. It has of frontage on Union Square West, to the east, and on 16th Street, to the south. At the western end of the 16th Street facade, the bank contains a deep wing. This wing runs adjacent to the four buildings at 33-39 Union Square West, and connects back to the Hartford Building at Broadway and 17th Street. The 32.5-foot-wide section on Union Square West exists because the owner of the Decker Building could not sell the corner lot along 16th Street. The L-shaped form was also present in the International Bank and Trust Company Building. Union Square facade The main entrance is on the narrow Union Square West facade, since Union Square was a coveted address at the time of the building's construction. The main entrance was designed to be symmetrical and emphasize the banking space on the ground floor, with a window to the left of the centrally-positioned banking entrance, and a door to the upper floors to the right. A journal article in 1916 said of prominent corner-lot bank locations that \\"the advantage [...] is generally appreciated\\", an observation that was made in the Landmarks Preservation Commission's report about the building. = Facade = The Bank of the Metropolis's facade is designed so that the building appears as a slab rising from the street. On the south and east facades, the 16-story building is broken up into three horizontal layers of articulation‚Äîa 2-story base with rusticated blocks, a 9-story tower, and a 3-story top section‚Äîwith one \\"transition\\" story between each layer. The tripartite articulation serves a more aesthetic than functional purpose. The north and west facades consist of plain brick. The eastern facade on Union Square West contains three vertical architectural bays. A curved, slightly projecting portico supported by two Ionic columns takes up the two base stories, and a carved plaque reading \\"Bank of the Metropolis\\" is located at the top of the portico. On either side of the portico are several rows of beveled masonry blocks. The southern facade on 16th Street contains 18 bays, split up into sections of 3, 3, 9, and 3 bays from west to east. At the ground level of the 16th Street facade, there are several wide, arched windows, which replaced the original square-framed windows there. These arched windows were installed after the ground level was converted into a restaurant. On both the south and east facades, the third story contains square-framed windows and projecting courses at the top and bottom. The fourth through 12th stories make up the \\"tower\\" section of the bank building, and are relatively flat, except for spandrels between each floor, which are embellished with lions. The 13th floor contains scrolled corbels between each set of windows, a string course along the bottom, and belt courses along the top. There are vertical panels between each window on the 14th and 15th floors, and palmettes and lions' heads at the top of each panel. A copper cornice runs atop the 16th floor. Along both facades, there are various recessions in the facade where limestone balconies jut out. The most prominent is on the 9-bay section of the southern facade, which contains a balcony projecting from the 10th floor. = Interior = At the time of the building's opening in 1903, it included a steam heating system, electrically powered lights, mail chutes, telephone lines, and elevators. The ground floor space, formerly the banking hall, was converted into a restaurant space, and is designed in the neoclassical style. The eastern one-fourth of the restaurant space is narrower than the rest. The north side wall is made of white marble on the bottom half and plaster on the top half. Architraves run across the coffered ceiling. A mezzanine is located above the westernmost portion of the restaurant space. The western part of the ground floor is separated from the restaurant by a partition. A marble-lined staircase close to the main entrance leads to a basement. To the north of the restaurant, on the eastern end is the office building lobby. A curving staircase leading upstairs is located at the west end of the lobby. Elevators are located within two arches of a three-arched arcade on the northern wall, while the lobby's southern wall is made of veined marble. The office building lobby is also coffered, but the coffers are smaller than in the restaurant space. The upper floors, formerly office space, were converted into residential units. Almost none of the original architectural features remain, except for the staircase with its wooden railings.  Critical review  Architectural writer Paul Goldberger called Price's design for the bank building \\"a lovely eclectic creation\\", praising its Ionic portico, narrow shaft, and \\"enormous, elaborate\\" cornice.

Kohler on his 90th birthday (2010) Fred Kohler (born 22 April 1920) is a German-born American inventor, author and lecturer who appears to be the first person to write about the human species becoming a \\"Societal Organism\\" (his original terminology) or Super Organism (in the popular modern usage) as a further development in the human evolution of life. Biography =Early years= Kohler was born in Nuremberg, Germany in 1920 into a secular, middle- class family of mostly German-Jewish ancestry. His mother died when he was eight years old and his father died when he was eleven. Kohler, an only child, was granted a life-saving visa as an orphan to enter the USA in 1935. After graduating from Stuyvesant High School in New York City in 1937 he was admitted to Cooper Union, a highly competitive, \\"tuition-free\\" college where he was, in 1942, granted a degree in Chemical Engineering. Kohler obtained American citizenship in 1943. Unable to join the Armed Forces in World War II because of eyesight problems, he engaged in war work as an engineer. Kohler was married for several years in the 1950s, but he has no children nor close relatives. In 1975 he obtained an M.A. from Southern Oregon University in Ashland, Oregon. =Career= Industrial activity 1946 - 1956 After World War II he started the Plastic Welding Company designing and building equipment for welding plastics. 1957 - 1965 Director of Research and Design, Thermatool corporation 1966 - 1967 Chief Engineer, Industrial Microwave Division of Eimac-Varian Kohler continued to pursue his profession as a research engineer, as a designer of industrial electronic equipment, and as a consultant and lecturer. Kohler was granted many patents for various inventions in the course of his activities. Kohler's achievement with the greatest technological impact was patent 3243753 making possible the polyswitch, an automatically resetting circuit protection device which shuts off a circuit when a current overload is sensed but automatically resets when the surge is over, thus avoiding blown fuses and machine stoppagesY.H. Sung and Q. Zheng, Journal of Polymer Science, Part B Polymer Physics, vol. 44, no. 14 (2006), pp. 1979-1984. Kohler's resettable fuse is now a passive component of many batteries in computers, VCRs, cars, and a host of other products. The cumulative sales of protective devices utilizing this material have run into several billions of dollars. Kohler derived no monetary rewards from this invention. Philosophical writings In 1952 Kohler published through the publishing house, Philosophical Library a book entitled Evolution and Human Destiny that he started writing in 1950. In this book Kohler argued that there is an integration process in evolution, homologous with other consolidation processes that have occurred in the evolution of life during previous epochs, that is leading in the human species towards the formation of a Super Organism on a higher level of complexity, which Kohler originally called a \\"Societal Organism.\\" In the form presented, this was a novel concept in 1952 and met with considerable skepticism, but also some support. Kohler's book has been recently re-introduced to a new generation by being digitized on the internet by the initiative of the Marine Biology Laboratory.http://cornelia.whoi.edu/cgi- bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&Search;_Arg=evolution%20and%20human%20destiny&Search;_Code=TALL&CNT;=10 Now the concept of an emerging super organism is far more acceptable to the intellectual community. Similar ideas are currently being expressed in several books, perhaps most clearly in Metaman,Gregory Stock, Metaman: The Merging of Humans and Machines into a Global Superorganism, , 1993 sold by Amazon.com by Dr. Gregory Stock and Lucy's LegacyAlison Jolly, Lucy's Legacy: Sex and Intelligence in Human Evolution, 1999. by Dr. Alison Jolly. In 2010 Kohler published on the internet through \\"Internet Archive\\" an essay entitled \\"Evolution and Human Destiny: Reflections of the Author Sixty Years after the Book was Written.\\" In that essay he corrects the antiquated biology and chemistry of the original book, but re-affirms his central concepts. He also discusses some unsolved problems in cosmology and expresses gratification that the most important concepts in Evolution and Human Destiny have largely been vindicated during his lifetime. He also reflects on his own life in that essay. =Recent activity= Kohler lived as an adult in New York, Hawaii, California, Arizona and in Ashland, Oregon where he resided from 1984 - 2014. He traveled widely and enjoyed good physical and mental health through his 90s. He enjoyed hiking on the Pacific Crest Trail and was active in discussions concerning the current status and future of humankind. Works * Evolution and Human Destiny.

In 1949, she contracted tuberculosis and was treated at a sanatorium. She recovered and hit the French jazz scene in the cabarets of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, coming to prominence in jazz clubs as a pianist in her own trio. She met her husband, an amateur guitar and bass player. Between 1956 and 1958, she was a member of Blossom Dearie's vocal group Blue Stars of France, but worked mostly in studios as a background singer to y√©-y√© singers and bands. In 1959, she formed the vocal sextet Les Double Six, which included, among others, Louis and Monique Aldebert, Roger Gu√©rin, Christiane Legrand, Ward Swingle, Eddy Louiss and Bernard Lubat. The band name alluded to the fact that the group used overdubbing in the studio to sing twelve-part songs. The group oriented itself to the vocalese of King Pleasure on one side, and Lambert, Hendricks & Ross on the other, and was quite successful in the early 1960s. Les Double Six completed several European tours and also traveled to North America, recording with Quincy Jones, Dizzy Gillespie, and Ray Charles. Perrin was the leader and principal soloist in the group and established herself solo with John Coltrane's song \\"Naima\\" \\"as one of the great jazz singers.\\"Martin Kunzler: Jazzlexikon, . From her ensemble eventually emerged the Swingle Singers, led by Ward Swingle after he left the Double Six. A later group, founded in 1966 by Perrin, did not achieve her previous success, and she abandoned music after another bout of tuberculosis. From 1972 onwards, she worked as a translator of science-fiction and fantasy stories by Roger Zelazny, Robert Sheckley, James Blish, and Dean Koontz, among others. In the 1980s and 1990, she translated more mainstream novels (including Alice Walker's The Color Purple and Louise Erdrich's Tracks and Love Medicine) as well as biographies of Nina Simone, Dizzy Gillespie, Quincy Jones and Steven Spielberg. She was also known for her French rendition of the novels by John le Carr√© since 1989, and later by Ha Jin, with her daughter Isabelle.

It was identified during a full transcriptome screen of the C. elegans cDNA library. Subsequent experimentation characterised sbRNA as having conserved 5' and 3' internal motifs which form a long paired stem which is interrupted with a bulge. Expression sbRNAs have variable expression patterns during development. They are most highly expressed in adult worms, dauer larvae and following heat shock. A systematic knockout analysis using RNAi found no phenotype for the knockout of two sbRNAs in C. elegans, however the efficiency of RNAi on ncRNA has been questioned. sbRNAs contain immunoglobulin in their protein fibers to maintain rigidity, however they are at risk of infection from malfunctioning ribosomes. sbRNAs share common promoter elements consisting of a TATA box and a proximal sequence element (PSE B box), though only one of these is required for transcription. As the transcript is uncapped and polyuridylated, it is thought to be transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Y RNA homology An sbRNA, CeN134 was reported as a candidate homologue to the vertebrate Y RNA during a kingdom- wide search. Further investigation found a homologous secondary structure with a conserved helical regions and a common UUAUC loop motif. The function of sbRNAs may therefore be similar to that of vertebrate Y RNAs, namely acting as part of the Ro-RNA particle to control RNA quality and playing a role in chromosomal replication. Deletion of sbRNA does not prevent chromosome replication in C. elegans, but this may be a result of other sbRNAs substituting missing elements (as in human Y RNA). This theory also explains why RNAi studies failed to detect a phenotype for knocked out sbRNAs.

Originally known as the Germania Life Insurance Company Building, it was designed by Albert D'Oench and Joseph W. Yost and built in 1911 in the Beaux-Arts style. The W New York Union Square building was initially the headquarters of the Germania Life Insurance Company. In 1917, when the company became the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, the building was renamed the Guardian Life Insurance Company Building. A four-story annex to the east was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and was completed in 1961. Guardian Life moved its offices out of the building in 1999, and the W New York Union Square opened the following year. The main building, part of the hotel, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001, and was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1988. The Guardian Life annex, not part of the current hotel, was designated as a city landmark in 2007.  Site  The W New York Union Square building's site measures along Park Avenue South and along 17th Street. The building is located at the northeast corner of that intersection, diagonally across from Union Square to the southwest. Its immediate neighbors include the four-story International Style Guardian annex and several rowhouses to the east; the former Tammany Hall building at 44 Union Square to the south; the Everett Building across Park Avenue to the west; and a five-story commercial building and a twenty-story loft structure to the north. The building is one of the few remaining major insurance company \\"home office\\" structures in New York City.  Design  Seen from Union Square, to the southwest The W New York Union Square building is designed in the Beaux-Arts style. It is 21 stories tall, with the 18th through 21st stories being located within the mansard roof. A \\"light court\\" on the north side of the building gives it a U-shaped footprint. According to building plans, D'Oench and Yost considered the Germania Life Building's main roof to be a flat roof above the 17th floor. The building is divided into three horizontal sections: a three-story base with a ground floor and two-story \\"transitional section\\"; a 12-story \\"shaft\\" below another 2-story \\"transitional section\\"; and the four-story roof. The building rises above ground level. Two basement levels are located below ground level, and there is a mezzanine between the second and third floors. The interior structure is supported by steel plate girders below the fourth floor. Above that level, the structure is composed primarily of I-beams, with flange plates at their tops and bottoms. The building also incorporates curtain walls in its design. According to critic A. C. David, the optimal building design included high ceilings and large windows to maximize natural light coverage. The Germania Life Building not only included these features, but also had a corner location that was conducive toward the maximization of natural light. However, unlike many buildings being built on Park Avenue in the 1900s and 1910s, the Germania Life Building also retained traditional design features. For instance, the building used masonry instead of a terracotta-clad metal structure for fireproofing. = Facade = The W New York Union Square building facade is composed mostly of gray Concord granite interspersed with brick, except for the red Numidian- granite water table, and the red Spanish-tile mansard roof. The foundation walls are made of brick, mortar, and cement. On all floors, there are eight architectural bays, three facing Park Avenue to the west and five facing 17th Street to the south. The ground floor facade is rusticated with several rows of beveled masonry blocks, and deep crevices between each row of blocks. In each of the ground-floor bays, there are rusticated arches with foliate keystones. The arches formerly contained storefronts until the building's conversion into a hotel. The main entrance is from the northernmost arch on Park Avenue South. A belt course runs on the facade between the ground and second floors. The second and third floor facades are also rusticated with beveled blocks but have shallower crevices between each row. The center bay on Park Avenue South and the center three bays on 17th Street contain double- story arched openings with keystones at top, while each of the bay at the ends of each facade contain two windows per floor. On the Park Avenue South side, there is a small iron balcony projecting from the third story of the double arch, with the initials \\"G\\" and \\"L\\" on the iron railing. The third floor facade is topped by a denticulated (tooth-like) cornice. Signs with the company name were formerly located above the third floor on both the Park Avenue South and 17th Street sides. The facades of the fourth through fifteenth floors are largely uniform, with shallow belt courses and quoins in the spaces between each set of windows. Shallow balconies on the fourth floor, with stone colonnades, are located above the denticulated third-floor cornices on the Park Avenue South and 17th Street sides, and run across nearly the entire width of both facades. On the west and east facades, the fenestration or window arrangement is in a 2-3-2 format, i.e. there are two windows per floor on the side bays and three windows per floor in the central bay. On the south facade, the fenestration is in a 2-2-2-2-2 format, i.e. five bays with two windows each. The beige-brick-clad north facade contains the recessed \\"light court\\" and is divided into two asymmetric sections, both with simple window openings. The center bays on the west and south facades contain projecting windowsills on the fourth through fourteenth floors. Above the 15th and 17th stories are stone cornices. The 16th story also used to have a cornice above it, but the cornice was replaced around 1940 with a fascia of sheet metal. The 16th floor contains panels depicting torches and shields in the spaces between each bay, while the 17th floor facade is unadorned. = Roof = Mansard roof detail, seen from the ground at Union Square The W New York Union Square building's most prominent feature is its four-story mansard roof, which contains dormer windows, escutcheons, and five decorative keystones with garlands. On the 18th story, the west and east facades contain fenestration in a 2-3-2 format and the south facade contains fenestration in a 2-3-3-3-2 format. On the 19th story, the west and east facades' fenestration is in a 1-3-1 format and the south facade's fenestration is in a 1-3-3-3-1 format. There are carved scallops atop each of the window groupings on the 18th and 19th stories. On the 20th story, the west and east facades contain a triple window in the center, topped by a large triangular pediment, while there are two standalone dormer windows on each side of the triple window, all with smaller pediments. The south side of the 20th story contains ten dormer windows, all with pediments. On the 21st story, there are five round-arched dormer windows on the west and east facades, and eight round-arched dormer windows on the south facade. A horizontal band runs at the top of the 21st story facade, below a cornice, while vertical acroteria run along the roof's corners. The roof was influenced by both 19th-century French architecture and the Second Empire style. Inspiration also came from the now-demolished New York Tribune Building (completed 1905) in Civic Center, Manhattan, which was topped by a three-story mansard roof. In addition, during the 1870s, Germania had added a mansard roof to their otherwise unadorned Italianate headquarters in the Financial District. D'Oench and Yost had decided to retain this feature in their design for the new building. The roof also incorporates several features of German architectural styles because of the company's and D'Oench's German roots. For example, the designs of the dormer windows are different for each floor, and there is elaborate decoration, consistent with 16th-century German architecture. On top of the roof is a horizontal lighted sign with white letters. It originally contained the letters \\"Germania Life\\". The sign was changed to \\"Guardian Life\\" in 1917 upon the company's renaming. Most of the letters seem to have been reused when the sign was replaced, while the letters \\"E\\" and \\"M\\" were replaced with a \\"U\\" and \\"D\\". The sign was later replaced with a \\"W Union Square\\" sign. = Interior = The floors are made of multicolored marble pattern on the ground-floor main entrance, tile on the ground-floor retail area, terrazzo with mosaic borders on the second through fourth floors, and cement on the fifth through 20th stories and in the basements. The ground-floor entrance area also contains white English veined marble on the walls, capped by stucco decoration. The restrooms are designed with hexagonal-tiled floors, tile wainscoting, and stalls made with marble barriers. Inside the building are eight elevators, five for passenger use and three for freight transport. There are also two enclosed hallways on each floor, and two enclosed staircases within the building. One particularly heavily-ornamented interior space is the second-story elevator lobby, which contains a marble floor and English marble walls and ceilings. The elevator lobby is supported by round arches that divide it into an arcade with five domes. Directly to the south, accessed through three sets of openings, is a , double-height space, originally used for selling insurance before being converted into the W Hotel ballroom. The lower halves of the ballroom's walls contain marble wainscoting. Various ornaments, cartouches, and motifs are located throughout the ballroom, including several instances of Guardian Life's initials. = Guardian Life annex = The Guardian Life Insurance Company Annex, also known as 105 East 17th Street, was completed in 1961. It is located just to the east of the 20-story hotel tower, between Irving Place to the east and Park Avenue South to the west. It contains two 4-story facades: the southern facade abuts 17th Street to the south while the northern facade is adjacent to 18th Street to the north. The 17th Street facade is slightly wider, measuring long with nineteen architectural bays, while the 18th Street facade is long and contains twelve bays. On both sides, the facades contain aluminum spandrels and thin projecting mullions between each architectural bay. There is a rolldown metal gate and a revolving door on the western portion of the annex's 17th Street facade, on the portion adjacent to the hotel. The western portion of the annex's 18th Street facade contains a recessed brick portion with metal emergency doors.  History  = Context and planning = Union Square was first laid out in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, expanded in 1832, and then made into a public park in 1839. By the first decade of the 20th century, Union Square had grown into a major transportation hub with several elevated and surface railroad lines running nearby, and the New York City Subway's 14th Street‚ÄìUnion Square station opening in 1904. In August 1909, the Real Estate Record and Guide announced that D'Oench & Yost had been hired to build a new 20-story headquarters for the Germania Life Insurance Company at the northeast corner of Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue South) and 17th Streets. The company, founded in 1860 to serve New York City's German community, occupied several successive buildings before settling at a six-story building at Cedar and Nassau Streets in Manhattan's Financial District. The Nassau Street building had suffered from structural problems, the most serious being a sinking foundation,Miller, Tom (September 2, 2011). \\"The 1910 Germania (Guardian) Life Insurance Building - 201 Park Avenue So.\\". Daytonian in Manhattan. and it was sold to the Fourth National Bank of New York in March 1909. The company also could no longer rent out its vacant space at Nassau Street at a profit, and its directors sought to build a new headquarters in advance of its 50th anniversary. When Germania's directors decided to buy the Park Avenue site in mid-1909 at a cost of $350,000 (), the directors wanted to ensure that their headquarters would not be overshadowed by its neighbors, so they directed D'Oench & Yost to build a structure of at least 16 stories. The four-story mansard roof was added to the plans later. At the time of the Guardian Life Building's construction, life insurance companies generally had their own buildings for their offices and branch locations, to ensure that they had instilled \\"not only its name but also a favorable impression of its operations\\" in the general public. This had been a trend since 1870, with the completion of the former Equitable Life Building in Manhattan's Financial District. Furthermore, life insurance companies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries generally built massive buildings to fit their large clerical and records-keeping staff. = Use as office building = After conversion into W New York Union Square; the Everett Building can be seen at far left Germania Life moved to its new Union Square headquarters on April 24, 1911. When the building was completed the following month, the total cost of the structure was about $1.45 million (equal to $ million in ). Germania Life made additional profit by leasing out its unused space at its headquarters. In 1918, during World War I, the company was renamed the Guardian Life Insurance Company to avoid associations with Germany, which had become one of the Central Powers against which the United States was fighting. The company then changed the large \\"Germania Life Insurance Company\\" sign on the headquarters' roof to read \\"Guardian Life Insurance Company\\". Several other alterations took place over the years, including the removal of the 16th-story cornice in 1940 and replacement of the storefront windows in 1957. Further, the entrance lobby from Park Avenue South was renovated in the 1960s and the 1980s. By the mid-20th century, Guardian Life had grown significantly, with $2 billion in assets by 1960 (equal to $ billion in ). Guardian had also occupied all of its vacant space in the building, and to alleviate the shortage of space, considered moving uptown to Midtown Manhattan or further north to Westchester County. Sites in White Plains and New Rochelle in Westchester were considered, but both proposals faced opposition from residents and Guardian Life employees, leading the company to decide to expand its Union Square location. In 1959, the company announced that it would build an adjacent , four-story annex at 105 East 17th Street. The annex, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, was completed in 1961. Unlike the original structure, the annex occupied the full width of the block to 18th Street. During the 1980s, Guardian Life expanded again to 225/233 Park Avenue South, signing a lease for . Guardian signed a lease for in a fourth building, 215 Park Avenue South, in the early 1990s. = Conversion to hotel = In 1998, Guardian Life moved its headquarters to the Financial District of Manhattan, with plans to sell their old headquarters. The next year, the Related Companies announced that the Guardian Life Insurance Company Building would be renovated into a 250-room hotel operated by hotel chain Starwood. The hotel would be the first in the Union Square neighborhood. As part of the conversion, Related planned to remove the red neon \\"Guardian Life Insurance Company\\" sign and replace it with \\"W New York Union Square\\", the name of the W Hotels resort that would occupy the building. Workers removed the last two letters of the sign before the city announced that the removal had been illegal and saying that the Landmarks Preservation Commission had to approve the action, thereby temporarily halting the process. The hotel opened in December 2000, with 270 rooms, and the \\"W Union Square\\" sign was added to the roof. The basement was used by several event spaces, including Rande Gerber's Underbar lounge and Todd English's Olives restaurant. The annex was not included in the hotel conversion and continued to be used as offices. The W New York Union Square was sold in 2006 for $285 million to Istithmar World, a Dubai government-owned investment group. The sales of the W New York Union Square and the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai in Hawaii, both at rates of over $1 million per room, at the time were the highest-ever selling rates for hotels that were not scheduled for renovation. In 2014, Gerber Group took over the Olives restaurant at the W New York Union Square and renovated it into a restaurant called the Irvington, after Washington Irving, the namesake of nearby Irving Place. Marriott Hotels & Resorts purchased the W New York Union Square in October 2019 for $206 million, with plans to renovate the building.  Landmark designations  In 1988, the Guardian Life Building was designated a New York City landmark. The building, along with the Everett Building at the northwest corner of Park Avenue South and 17th Street, were described by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as forming an \\"imposing terminus to Park Avenue South\\". The W New York Union Square building was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on May 25, 2001. The annex, not part of the present hotel and not on the NRHP, was also made a city landmark in 2007.

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland  = Alice's sister = Alice's sister Alice's older sister, who reads a book without illustrations or dialogues, sits on the bank with Alice at the beginning of the book. Alice falls asleep with her head in her sister's lap and has the dream about Wonderland. When Alice awakes, she tells her sister about her dream, and the book closes with her sister daydreaming about what Alice will be like as a grown-up. Some believe that she is named Lorna after Alice's real-life sister. Her name was never revealed in Disney's film, but she was named Mathilda in Disney's Alice in Wonderland Jr. She is named Aida in the 1995 film. In the 2010 film she is married and her name is Margaret. = Dinah = Dinah is Alice's cat and bosom companion in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There. Alice talks to Dinah, and mentions her frequently to Wonderland residents. When Alice describes Dinah's hunting skills to the animals in the Caucus Race, they become very uncomfortable. = The Duchess's Cook = The ill-mannered, belligerent and volatile cook works as a servant to the Duchess. The copious amounts of pepper (which alludes to a quick temper) she uses in her soup cause Alice, the Duchess, and her son to sneeze incessantly. Her fury at being disrupted during her cooking is made clear when she throws various pots and pans, aiming to hit both Alice and the baby. She makes another brief appearance as a key witness at the Queen of Hearts's trial, where she claims that the stolen tarts were made with pepper. = The Eaglet, the Lory, the Duck, and the Dodo = The Rev. Duckworth inspired Carroll The Eaglet, the Duck, the Dodo, the Lory and others; illustration by John Tenniel The Eaglet, the Lory, the Duck, and the Dodo are characters appearing in chapters two and three of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Carroll incorporated references in his works to a group of his friends present on a boating outing on the River Thames which occurred on 4 July 1862. Carroll at the time was relating his newly forming story to the three girls, their family, and some friends. Alice Liddell became Alice; with the others represented by birds in these passages from the book. The Lory character was based on Lorina Charlotte Liddell, Alice's older sister reflecting on the Victorian era that older siblings had more power over the younger sibling. The Eaglet was also another sister, Edith Liddell; and the Duck was a caricature of Rev. Robinson Duckworth. The Dodo referenced Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Carroll) himself.Carroll, Lewis & Gardner, Martin (2000). The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition, pp. 27‚Äì28. W. W. Norton & Company, Inc. It began to rain during the outing, and the group left for a nearby house. As they walked, only Alice, Lorina, and Edith could keep up. Carroll and the sisters got there first, as they walked the fastest. (According to The Annotated Alice, Carroll had originally had the characters dry off by having the Dodo lead them to a nearby house for towels.) Carroll ultimately replaced this scene in the book with the \\"Caucus race\\", as he felt that the original story would have been funny only to the people familiar with the incident. = The Executioner = He is the royal Executioner of the King and Queen of Hearts. The Queen of Hearts ordered the Cheshire Cat to be decapitated, but the Executioner argued that he couldn't because the Cat lacked a body to decapitate. This led to an argument between the Queen, the King and the Executioner about whether or not a disembodied head could be decapitated. The Executioner then argued that the Cat belonged to the Duchess, so he couldn't behead it without her permission. He is most commonly depicted as a playing card (similar to the Card painters) and his suit is clubs, though he has also been a spade, a heart and, in American McGee's Alice, a joker. In the 1951 film several of the Card Soldiers in the Queen's court are executioners. They are all spades, rather than clubs, and carry axes. As are all of the Card Soldiers they are voiced by Don Barclay and Larry Grey. The Cook, The Pig Baby, and The Duchess In Tim Burton's 2010 film the executioner is an assassin working for the Red Queen, rather than the Queen of Hearts. He made a brief appearance in the film, where he was assigned to behead the Mad Hatter. Before executing him, the Executioner wanted to remove his hat, but when the Hatter insisted that he wanted to keep it on, he agreed when as long as he could get at his neck. When he swings his axe, it hit the block instead of the neck of the Mad Hatter, as it was the Cheshire Cat in disguise as the Hatter. As the Cheshire Cat floats away with Hatter's hat, the Executioner looks as shocked as other inhabitants of the Red Queen's court. Soon after that, the Red Queen ordered for her courtiers to be executed. Whether the Executioner actually ended their lives or not is unknown. In the film, the Executioner uses a heart shaped axe, hinting his suit is hearts. The Executioner was played by the English actor Jim Carter. The executioner is the only humanoid character, in the film, to be completely CGI and he speaks only one line in the entire film. He wears a long grey cloak and a hood that covers his face. The Executioner appears as an enemy in the video game Alice: Madness Returns. He stays in the Queens castle and is completely invulnerable to any of Alice's attacks. He has the appearance of an extremely large humanoid made of several different Card Guard parts, each piece of his sewn-together body showing a symbol of a certain suit of a card deck. The top of his head is masked by a large horned hat, and several of the Queen's tentacles are wrapped around the top of his body, even going through his eye sockets. On his is head is what looks like a jester's hat and all Card colors may imply that Executioner is a Joker Card (hence its special abilities), but it is not confirmed. = Fish Footman = The Fish and Frog Footmen In Lewis Carroll's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the Fish Footman delivers a croquet invitation from the Queen of Hearts to the Duchess's Frog Footman, which he then delivers to the Duchess. In Japan, he is called the Fish Orderly or the Fishfootman In Tim Burton's 2010 remake of Alice in Wonderland, the Red Queen has a Fish Footman working in her castle as a butler. Both the Frog Footmen and the Fish Footman have been shown in a featurette for Tim Burton's adaptation, which premiered March 5, 2010. = Frog Footman = An anthropomorphic frog with a bow tie and white hair who serves as a footman to The Duchess. He received a letter from a fish- footman to give it to the duchess. In the 2010 movie, there are multiple Frog Footmen who work for the Red Queen. One of them was about to be executed for eating the queen's tarts as he was too hungry. The Frog Footman does not appear in Walt Disney's 1951 film, though there is a drum frog with a detached green head and green legs and a cymbal frog with eyes on top and blue legs in the Tulgey Wood. In the computer game American McGee's Alice, even though the frog-footman do not appear in game, searching through the files on the disk prove there was indeed a Frog Footman programmed for the game. To view this character in game you need to open the game console and type \\"actor c_frogfootman\\" = Mary Ann = The White Rabbit's housemaid. Alice is mistaken for her. She does not appear at all and is only mentioned. = The Pig Baby = The Pig Baby is mentioned in Chapter 6 of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, titled \\"Pig and Pepper.\\" When Alice enters the Duchess's house, she sees the Duchess holding a human baby, as shown in John Tenniel's illustration. The baby is wailing and sneezing due to the pepper particles in the air. The Duchess then goes on to sing \\"Speak Roughly to your little boy\\", shaking the baby wildly and adding to the already chaotic scene in the house. The Duchess flings the baby at Alice who catches it and then walks outside. She starts to realize that the baby is not really human after all, since it starts to grow pig ears and a turnt-up nose. Alice finally sets down the pig, as it then scurries off into the woods. = The Playing Cards = The Playing Cards They are playing cards with a human head, arms and legs. They are loyal servants as well as guards for the Queen of Hearts. They mainly carry spears with the tip shaped as a heart. Alice first meets three cards at the Queen's castle painting white roses red. One of them explains that they accidentally planted white roses, and because the Queen hates white roses they have to paint them red or the Queen will behead them. After the Queen arrives, she finds white roses and orders the execution of all three. Alice declares that they \\"shan't be beheaded\\" and hides them in a flowerpot. Their would-be executioners spend a minute or two looking for them before giving up. When Alice joins a game of croquet with the Queen and the other playing cards, the card soldiers act as arches. They have to leave being arches every time the Queen has an executioner drag the victim away. They also appear in the trial where the Knave of Hearts is accused for stealing the Queen's tarts. The Playing Cards also appear in the 1951 Alice in Wonderland animated film as playing cards with masks shaped like card symbols that match their spears and gloves. They also march as they chase Alice even over the hedges of the labyrinth. They are played by The Mellomen, Don Barclay and Larry Grey. The Playing Cards also appeared in House of Mouse voiced by Corey Burton. They appear in the 2010 film as playing cards with red armor that covers their body, masks and shoulder plates shaped like hearts, and spears with tips shaped like hearts. There are no cards of spades, clubs or diamonds, for only cards of hearts appear in this film. They are called \\"Red Knights\\" and serve the Red Queen. They appear in the video game, American McGee's Alice where they carry axes and bow guns. In the novel The Looking Glass Wars, they appear as robots with their outer layer shaped as cards and spears. They can fly while in card form and can walk as well as spear in soldier form. They work for Queen Redd, the main antagonist of the series. In the otome game Alice in the Country of Hearts (Heart no Kuni no Alice), they are humans with card- marked uniforms that have different numbers for each servant and British hats. There appear to be female versions of these as well. = Tortoise = Tortoise is the Mock Turtle's teacher. He does not appear, but is only mentioned. He is a sea turtle and when Alice asks why he was called Tortoise if he was a turtle, the Mock Turtle replies with a play on words; \\"We called him tortoise because he taught us!\\"  Through the Looking-Glass  = Returning characters = Dinah, Alice's cat, in an illustration from Through the Looking-Glass Several characters from the original book, other than Alice, appear. The most prominent is Dinah who reappears now the mother of two kittens. She assumes the role of Humpty Dumpty. Though Alice's sister does not appear she is briefly mentioned. The Hatter and the Hare also reappear as messengers for the White King, renamed Hatta and Haigha. The Frog Footman also makes a minor reappearance as a gardener. = Kitty = Kitty, the black kitten Kitty is Dinah's black kitten and a character of the Lewis Carroll's novel Through The Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There. Kitty, who assumes the role of the Red Queen, appears in chapters I and XII. = Snowdrop = Snowdrop is Dinah's white kitten and a character of Lewis Carroll's novel Through The Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There. Snowdrop, who assumes the role of the White Queen, appears in chapters I and XII. = Nobody = A character the White King mentions when Alice says \\"I see nobody on the road\\". Considering how the king refers to Nobody like a person he was familiar with, it suggests that the king actually knew somebody named Nobody. = Talking Flowers = The Talking Flowers The flowers Alice meet include a tiger-lily, a rose, daisies, a violet, and a larkspur. Alice first meets them in the garden, where they mistake her for a type of flower that can move. The one Alice first makes contact with is a tiger-lily, who sets the other flowers straight. When Alice asks if they are frightened when no one takes care of them, the rose tells her that the tree in the middle is there. The daisies tell her that it says \\"Bough-wough\\", which is why branches are called boughs. Then all of them make shrill voices and don't stop until Alice whispers that she will pick them if they don't hold their tongues. The violet rudely tells Alice that she had never seen anyone looked stupider, of course, she had never seen anybody herself as explained by the tiger-lily. The rose tells her there is another flower that can move like her and looks like her but that she is redder, her petals are shorter, and she wears her thorns on her head. The larkspur hears this flower on the gravel-walk. Alice discovers that the red flower is the Red Queen, her hair the petals and thorns the points of her crown. Alice leaves the flowers to meet the Queen. Some of the flowers are pawns with the daisies being both red and white, while the tiger-lily and the rose are red. In 1998, the minor planet 17768 Tigerlily was named after tiger-lily., Minor Planet Center In the Disney movie, Alice meets them just before she meets the Caterpillar. They sing her a song called the \\"Golden Afternoon\\", from \\"All in the golden afternoon...\\". They are voiced by Lucille Bliss, Queenie Leonard, Doris Lloyd, Marni Nixon and Norma Zimmer. They also appear in the 2010 movie. They are played by Imelda Staunton, whose head was filmed and digitally added to the Flower Heads. = Red Knight = The Red Knight The Knight comes across Alice while riding through a wood at the start of chapter VIII. He attempts to capture her for the Red side, but then the White Knight suddenly appears and exclaims that he has rescued her. They decide to fight over her, in the manner according to Looking-Glass Land's bizarre \\"Rules of Battle.\\" Alice remarks to herself that these rules seem to be: (1) \\"if one Knight hits the other, he knocks him off his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himself\\", (2) both combatants must \\"hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were Punch and Judy\\", and (3) both combatants must always fall on their heads. The contests ends when both knights fall from their horses and the White is inexplicably decided the victor. They shake hands and then the Red mounts and gallops away. He is the Red King's knight.Dramatis Personae at alice-in-wonderland.net = Train Passengers = Train passengers and guard While taking a train across the third square, Alice encounters several passengers, including a man dressed entirely in white paper, a goat, a horse with a cold, a beetle, and the Gnat (see below). = Guard = A guard on the train through the third square. He collects the passengers' giant tickets. He gets angry at Alice when she doesn't have one. = Aged Man = The Aged Man and the White Knight He only appears within the poem, Haddocks' Eyes that the White Knight recites to Alice in chapter VIII. According to the poem, the Knight met the Aged Man sitting atop a gate in a field and questioned him as to his profession. The Man responds with a long list of absurd occupations, including making waistcoat buttons from the eyes of haddocks and digging for buttered rolls. The last stanza closes by describing him as: ...that old man I used to know‚Äî Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow Whose hair was whiter than the snow, Whose face was very like a crow, With eyes, like cinders, all aglow, Who seemed distracted with his woe, Who rocked his body to and fro, And muttered mumblingly and low, As if his mouth were full of dough... The Aged Man represents the White King's bishop. = Lily = She is the daughter of the White Queen. The Queen is looking for her daughter Lily. Since she is too young to play, Alice takes her place as a pawn. = The Monstrous Crow = The Crow is listed as the Red King's bishop, but Alice never encounters it over the course of the story. According to the rhyme, it is \\"black as a tar-barrel\\" and of a monstrous size. The Tweedle brothers (white rooks) are terrified of the Crow, and when the pair see the White Queen's shawl being blown around by the wind at the end of chapter IV, they mistake it for the dread bird and flee through the woods. = The White Knight = The White Horse and the White Knight The White Knight appears in the eighth chapter when his rider, the White Knight, is ready to save Alice from the Red Knight. The White Knight has an odd assortment of materials carried by his, a bee-hive, a mouse-trap, a bag with chandeliers and a plum-cake, bunches of carrots, fire-irons, and many other things. In the 2010 Tim Burton film the White Knight appears as the horse of Mirana, the White Queen. He appears in the Frabjous Day, with the White Queen, Alice and the rest of the White Army. = Bread and Butterfly = The Bread and Butterfly The Bread-and-Butterfly is an insect from Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There. Its name and form is a pun on bread and butter. Its wings are thin slices of bread-and-butter, with a crust as its body and a lump of sugar as its head. It lives on weak tea with cream in it. In the 1951 Disney movie, it appears as a butterfly that has wings of bread with butter spread on them. = Rocking Horse Fly = Rocking horsefly The Rocking-Horse-Fly is an insect from Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There. Its name and form is a pun on the rocking-horse. Its body is that of a horse with black dots and wings on its back, while its legs are connected to rockers. It is made entirely of wood and rocks about. It lives on sap and sawdust. In the 1951 Disney movie its body is yellow, while its saddle, tail, and rockers are red. In the 2010 adaptation, it has a black-and-white polka- dotted body. It has hair on its neck and tail. A Rocking-Horse-Fly was seen defending itself against a Snap-Dragonfly; another was seen rocking on a mushroom in the mushroom garden. In the manga Pandora Hearts, which is basically saturated with references to the books, there is a Chain that bears a resemblance to the Rocking-Horse Fly. = Snap-Dragonfly = The Snap Dragonfly The Snap-Dragonfly is an insect from Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There. Its name and form is a pun on a traditional game called snap-dragon combined with a plant called a snapdragon and a dragonfly. In the 2010 adaptation, the Snap-Dragonfly's body, head, and tail are those of a dragon with antennae resembling long and thin horns; therefore, its name and form is a pun on 'dragon' from dragonfly. Snap-Dragonflies are seen flying around, with one of them fighting a Rocking-Horse-Fly. = The Gnat = Alice meets the gnat on her head. He calls Alice an old friend, but Alice doesn't recognize him‚Äîcausing him to become depressed. During the train ride, Alice hears the Gnat mentioning topics he believes would make good jokes. The Gnat seems to love jokes; however, he doesn't like telling them himself‚Äîhe prefers others to tell the jokes. After the journey on the train, the Gnat introduces her to three insects: the Rocking-Horse-Fly, the Snap-Dragonfly, and the Bread-and-Butterfly. He then sighs himself away. Though the Gnat doesn't make an appearance in the 1999 film, he was mentioned in the second verse of 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat,' when the Mad Hatter was recognized by the Queen of Hearts. = The Fawn = Alice and the fawn Alice meets the fawn in Chapter 3 after getting off the train, and coming to an open field. No longer being able to remember her name, she sees the fawn. They have both forgotten their names, and decide to walk together as they ponder them. The fawn then remembers its name, and realizes Alice is a human, instinctively running away. Alice cries after it, but is glad that he helped her to remember her own name. In the 1985 film, Alice meets it after meeting the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse. The fawn doesn't speak, but it sucks on Alice's fingers. Alice sings a song to it, and then it leaves to find its mother while Alice leaves to try and get back home.  Characters created for films  In the 2010 Tim Burton film several characters were created. These include: * Bayard the Bloodhound (voiced by Timothy Spall) ‚Äì an older version of the Puppy from chapter IV of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland * The Ascots ‚Äì A Family whose son Hamish (Leo Bill) wishes to marry Alice. Lord and Lady Ascot are played by Tim Pigott-Smith and Geraldine James, respectively. * Charles Kingsleigh was Alice's beloved father who later passes away. Charles is played by the New Zealand actor Marton Csokas. His wife is played by Lindsay Duncan The Doorknob (Joseph Kearns) is a character created for the 1951 Disney Film. It likes to sleep, and therefore prefers silence over noise. As shown in Kingdom Hearts video game, The Doorknob also hides the world's Keyhole. The Doorknob is the only character from the 1951 film to not have appeared in the book itself. It also uses the phrase \\"One good turn deserves another\\", an idiom first recorded at the end of the 14th century.one good turn deserves another ‚Äì idioms and phrases, idioms.yourdictionary.com Contrary to the entry in Jiminy's Journal, Sora and company never enter through the door on which the Doorknob is fixed. The Doorknob appears again in Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, this time having a conversation with Roxas. The Owl appears in the second segment of the 1985 movie version, first as a painting, then at other points as a character who gives Alice advice about courage. He is played by Jack Warden.

Outside the white area of the upperside, the wings are orange to brown, with a pattern of lighter and darker flecks. The underside of the body and wings mimic a dead leaf. A slightly diffuse but clear, sepia brown straight line divides the under wing in a zone next to the body and a zone near the wings' edges. The inner zone is mostly light beige with three parallel, curved, interrupted, grey brown wavy lines, circling the wings' attachment to the body. A triangle based on the front of the forewing and bordering the division line has the dark grayish-brown color of the outer zone. The outer zone of the underside of the hindwing has a line of clear eyespots while the forewing has vaguer markings. The outer spur on the hindwing is well developed. Male and female are alike.

It was named after Asser Levy, one of the first Jewish citizens of New York City, and a strong and influential advocate for civil liberties; it was built in 1904‚Äì06, p.88 and designed by Arnold W. Brunner and Martin Aiken of the firm Brunner & Aiken. One of the entrances to the bathhouse, which were once divided by gender The baths were an important part of the drive to alleviate sanitary problems in the city. Many New Yorkers, especially immigrants living in overcrowded tenements, had no place to bathe - an 1896 survey found that there was one bathtub in the Lower East Side for every 79 families\\"Asser Levy Recreation Center, Pool and Playground\\" on the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation website. Accessed:2011-02-17 - and progressive social reformers pushed for the construction of public bathhouses modeled on those of ancient Rome. In 1895, the state passed a law requiring that localities build public baths, but New York City did not build its first bathhouse, on Rivington Street until 1901. In 1903, the city's Department of Docks and Ferries released land for a new bathhouse on 23rd Street, which was originally called the East 23rd Street Bathhouse. The design by Brunner & Aiken in Roman Revival style was inspired by Roman baths and the \\"City Beautiful\\" movement as well. The building now houses two swimming pools, one outdoors for use in the summer, and one indoors for the rest of the year, and a public health club. It is part of the Asser Levy Recreation Center, which is adjacent to the Asser Levy Playground. The Asser Levy Public Baths building, which was restored by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation in 1988-90, was designated a New York City landmark in 1974, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The contemporaneous East 54th Street Bath and Gymnasium, at 348 East 54th Street, is also a designated Landmark.

The group established an international reputation in the early 1960s. The name of the group was an allusion to the fact that the sextet used double-tracking techniques to enhance and 'fatten' the sound, very much like Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys did in the recording studio. The membership of the group varied from recording to recording. The six members would all sing once to a recording track, then sing the exact duplicate performance again to a second track, \\"doubling\\" each individual vocal part. Singing in French, they performed jazz standards, particularly themes by Quincy Jones and Dizzy Gillespie, adding the poetic or humorous lyrics written by the imaginative Perrin. Inspired by several American groups, the singers vocalized in the manner of instruments, reconstructing brilliant improvisations of saxophones, trumpets or trombones. The group was not long-lasting. Because of Perrin's health problems (she had contracted tuberculosis in 1949), Les Double Six dissolved in 1966. They recorded four albums between 1959 and 1964. Many members of the group went on to join the Swingle Singers, which notably reproduced the works of Bach in the jazz vocal style.

Biography Steinman was born in 1892 in Obod√≥wka, part of the Soba≈Ñski estate in Podolia in the Russian Partition of Poland. It was a village in the Podolia Governorate of the Russian Empire, later again part of Poland after World War I, now Obodivka in Ukraine. In his youth, while studying in Chi≈üinƒÉu to obtain semikhah to become a rabbi, he began to publish his first stories. Starting in 1910, his works, in Yiddish and Hebrew, began to appear in newspapers such as \\"Rashaphim\\", \\"Ha-Shiluach\\" and \\"Ha-Tsefirah\\" and he earned a living by teaching. During those years, he became associated with David Frischmann and Hayim Nahman Bialik, who worked to obtain his release from service in the Imperial Russian Army. In 1917, following the Bolshevik Revolution, he adopted a communist ideology and asked to be allowed to develop Hebrew culture. He moved to Moscow and began to work for the Shtiebal publishing house and published his first novel. In 1919, he moved to Odessa and published the pamphlet \\"The Hebrew Communist\\". From 1920, Steinman was one of the regular writers for \\"Ha-Tsefirah\\" and for the Yiddush newspaper, \\"Der Mament\\" (The Moment). In 1923 to 1924, he published the magazine \\"Kolot\\" (Voices). In 1924, Steinman emigrated with his family to Mandate Palestine and began working for the Hebrew Writers Union. He became the first editor of the Hebrew literary magazine \\"Katuvim\\" in 1926, which was founded upon the initiative of Hayim Nahman Bialik. The magazine took its name from the Katuvim group founded by Steinman, Avraham Shlonsky and others to seek the renewal of Hebrew literature. From 1932 to 1933, Steinman was the sole editor of the magazine, which, however, lost the support of the Hebrew Writers Union. Throughout these years, Steinman continued his writing and published many books, including books of essays, novels, children's books and anthologies. He died in Tel Aviv in 1970. Awards and honours * In 1959, Steinman was the co-recipient (jointly with Avraham Shlonsky) of the Bialik Prize for literature. * In 1963, he was awarded the Israel Prize, in literature.

One visitor, \\"wearing head-to-toe black garb and a veil\\" told a Reuters correspondent that \\"The atmosphere is Islamic.

According to The Independent, \\"There is a widespread assumption in Gaza that Hamas... or at least businessmen close to the Islamic faction, are behind the venture.\\" According to Egyptian journalist Ashraf Abu Al-Houl writing in Al-Ahram, Al-Bustan is one of a rapidly growing group of Gaza pleasure parks, including Zahrat Al-Madain and the Crazy Water Park, so many of which were completed between his visit to Gaza in February and his return in July 2010 as to make Gaza \\"almost unrecognizable.\\" translation by MEMRI, July 28, 2010, Al Ahram, He continues, \\"A sense of absolute prosperity prevails, as manifested by the grand resorts along and near Gaza's coast. Further, the sight of the merchandise and luxuries filling the Gaza shops amazed me. Merchandise is sold more cheaply than in Egypt, although most of it is from the Egyptian market, and there are added shipping costs and costs for smuggling it via the tunnels ‚Äì so that it could be expected to be more expensive... the siege was broken even before Israel's crime against the ships of the Freedom Flotilla in late May; everything already was coming into the Gaza Strip from Egypt. If this weren't the case, businessmen would not have been able to build so many resorts in under four months.\\" According to Reuters, the resort is part of a \\"construction boom\\" in \\"recreational facilities\\" that has prompted some to criticize Hamas for putting money into entertainment venues like El-Bustan and the Crazy Water Park rather than into housing and infrastructure. Two months later, Crazy Water Park was burned down by masked men, in September 2010.

The hotel was built to house visitors to the coronation of King TƒÅufa ªƒÅhau Tupou IV and also marked the start of tourism to Tonga. It was renovated and expanded in 2001‚Äì2003 with a Chinese loan, adding a new wing and redeveloping the waterfront, and again with Chinese funding in 2006. This added 30 rooms and a convention centre whose main conference hall holds 400 people and was built for the 38th Pacific Islands Forum. Ownership was transferred to the government of Tonga in 2012 after the original hotel went into liquidation. Another renovation was begun in 2015 by the Tanoa Hotel Group with support from the government. The work was carried out by the Reddy Group. This preserved the original atmosphere of the public areas while modernising the rooms and added a pool bar, restaurant and spa area. It was reopened by King Tupou VI on 16 February 2017.

Ropes, 116 days, 1857 Race with Flying Fish, Wild Pigeon, and Trade Wind John Gilpin set sail from New York City on October 29, 1852, arriving in San Francisco in 93 days, 20 hours, under the command of Captain Justine Doane. The best day‚Äôs run during this voyage was 315 miles. Flying Fish, which left New York November 1, narrowly bested John Gilpin, arriving in 92 days, 4 hours. Clark describes the race between the two leaders, Flying Fish and John Gilpin, as follows: > The fleet was so large in 1853 that it was not uncommon for two or three > ships to be in company at sea, each striving to outsail the others. As we > have seen, the Flying Fish won the race this year, and from one of the > finest fleets of clippers that ever sailed from New York. The match between > her and the John Gilpin was exceedingly close, and taken altogether was one > of the best ever sailed upon this famous ocean course, the Derby of the sea. > It was Samuel Hall against Donald McKay, Justin Doane against Edward > Nickels, and all against the fleet. The John Gilpin sailed out past Sandy > Hook, October 29, 1852, followed by the Flying Fish on November 1st, and > before the green Highlands of Neversink had disappeared below the horizon > both ships were under a cloud of canvas. The Flying Fish fanned along > through the doldrums and crossed the equator 21 days from Sandy Hook, > leading the John Gilpin by one day. From the line to 50¬∞ S., the John Gilpin > made the run in 23 days, passing the Flying Fish and getting a clear lead of > two days. The Flying Fish did some fine sailing here; dashing through the > Straits of Le Maire, she came up alongside the John Gilpin just off the > Horn, and Nickels, ever famous for his jovial good cheer, invited Doane to > come aboard and dine with him, \\" which invitation,\\" the John Gilpins log- > book ruefully records, \\" I was reluctantly obliged to decline.\\" This is > perhaps the only instance of an invitation to dine out being received off > Cape Horn. Few men have had the opportunity to extend such unique > hospitality and certainly none could do so more heartily and gracefully than > the famous commander of the Flying Fish.

Few races over > thirty-mile courses have been sailed by yachts more evenly matched. Another contemporary account describes the strategies of the other two vessels in the race, the clippers Wild Pigeon and Trade Wind, and the impact of using Maury's Wind and Current Charts and Sailing Directions, which shortened the voyage between New York and California by 35 days, on average. > All sailed from New York in the autumn of 1852. The Wild Pigeon, October > 12th, the John Gilpin, October 29th, the Flying Fish, November 1st, and the > Trade Wind, November 14th. It was the season for the best passages. Each one > was provided with [Maury‚Äôs] Wind and Current Charts. Each one had evidently > studied them attentively; and each one was resolved to make the most of them > and do his best. All ran against time; but the John Gilpin and the Flying > Fish for the whole course, and the Wild Pigeon for part of it, ran neck and > neck, the one against the other, and each against all. It was a sweepstakes > with these ships, around Cape Horn and through both hemispheres. Evidently > the Fish was most confident that she had the heels of her competitors‚Äîshe > felt her strength and rejoiced in it; she was most anxious for a quick run, > and eager withal for a trial. She dashed down southwardly from Sandy Hook, > looking occasionally at the charts; but feeling proud in her sweep of wing, > and trusting confidently in the judgment of her master, she kept, on the > average, 200 miles to leeward of the right track. Rejoicing in her many > noble and fine qualities, she crowded on her canvas to its utmost stretch, > trusting quite as much to her heels as to the charts, and performed the > extraordinary feat of crossing, the sixteenth day out from New York, the > parallel of 5 degrees north. The next day she was well south of 4 degrees > north, and in the doldrums, longitude 34 degrees west. Now her heels became > paralyzed, her fortune seems to have deserted her awhile ‚Äîat least her > master, as the winds failed him, feared so; they gave him his motive > power‚Äîthey were fickle, and he was helplessly baffled by them. The bugbear > of a northwest current off Cape St. Roque began to loom up in his > imagination, and to look alarming; then the dread of falling to leeward came > upon him. Chances and luck seemed to conspire against him, and the mere > possibility of finding his ship backstrapped filled the mind of Nickels with > evil forebodings, and shook his faith in his guide. He doubted the charts, > and committed the mistake of the passage. The Sailing Directions had > cautioned the navigator again and again not to attempt to fan along to the > eastward in the equatorial doldrums; for by so doing he would himself engage > in a fruitless strife with baffling airs, sometimes reinforced in their > weakness by westerly currents. But the winds had failed; and so, too, the > smart captain of the Flying Fish evidently thought had the Sailing > Directions. The Sailing Directions advise the navigator to cross the calm > belt in as straight a line as the winds will allow, not fearing the land > about Cape St. Roque, or the current that is supposed to sweep round it. > Nickels, forgetting that the charts are founded on the experience of great > numbers, being tempted, turned a deaf ear to the caution, and flung away > three whole days and more of most precious time dallying in the doldrums. He > spent two days about the parallel of 3 degrees north, and his ship left the > doldrums, after this waste of time, nearly upon the same meridian at which > she entered them. She was still in 34 degrees, the current keeping her back > just as fast as she could fan east. After so great a loss, her very clever > master became sensible of his error. Leaving the spell-bound calms behind > him where he had undergone such great trials, he wrote in his log as > follows: \\" I now regret that, after making so fine a run to 5 degrees north, > I did not dash on and work my way to windward to the northward of St. Roque, > as I have experienced little or no westerly set since passing the equator, > whilst three or four days have been lost in working to the eastward between > the parallels of 5 and 3 degrees north against a strong westerly set\\"‚Äîand, > he might have added, with little or no wind. In three days after this he was > clear of St. Roque. Just five days before him, the Hazard had passed exactly > in the same place, and gained two days on tho Fish by cutting straight > across the doldrums, as the Sailing Directions advised him to do. The Wild > Pigeon arrived first off Cape Horn; but here she met with a westerly gale > which detained her ten days, while her competitors, the Fish and the Gilpin, > were coming up fast with fine winds and flowing sheets. The three swung > round tho Horn together, as if entering on the quarter stretch. On the 30th > of December, the three ships crossed the parallel of 35 degrees south, (in > the Pacific), tho first recognizing the Pigeon ; the Pigeon saw only \\"a > clipper ship\\"‚Äî for she could not conceive how the ship in sight could > possibly be the Flying Fish, as that vessel was not to leave New York for > some three weeks after she did. The Gilpin was only 30 or 40 miles off at > the same time. Tho race was now wing and wing, and had become exciting. With > fair winds and an open sea, the competitors had now a clear stretch to the > equator of 2,500 miles before them. The Flying Fish led the way, the Wild > Pigeon pressing her hard, and both dropping the Gilpin quite rapidly, who > was edging off to the westward. The two foremost reached the equator on the > 13th of January, the Fish leading just 25 miles in latitude, and crossing in > 112 deg. 17 min., the Pigeon 40 miles further to the east. The Gilpin > crossed the equator two days afterwards in 116 degrees, and made the > glorious run of 15 days thence to the Pilot Grounds off San Francisco. The > Flying Fish beat. She made the passage in 92 days and 4 hours from port to > anchor. The Gilpin in 93 days and 20 hours from port to pilot. The Wild > Pigeon had 118. The Trade Wind followed with 102 days, having taken fire and > burned for eight hours on the way. The result of this race may be taken as > an illustration as to how well navigators are now brought to understand the > winds and currents of the sea. Here are three ships, sailing on different > days, bound over a trackless waste of ocean for some 15,000 miles or more, > and depending alone on the fickle winds of heaven ... ; yet, like travelers > on the land bound upon the same journey, they pass and repass, fall in with > and recognize each other by the way; and what perhaps is still more > remarkable is the fact that these ships should each, throughout that great > distance, and under the wonderful vicissitudes of climates, winds, and > currents which they encountered, have been so skillfully navigated that ... > I do not find a single occasion on which they could have been better > handled, except in the single instance of the Flying Fish while crossing the > doldrums in the Atlantic. And this mistake her own master was prompt to > discover and quick to correct. Collision with iceberg on final voyage On November 30, 1857, John Gilpin left Honolulu, Hawaii, with 15 passengers aboard, bound for New Bedford, Massachusetts, carrying a cargo of 7500 barrels of whale oil. During the voyage, on January 29, 1858, about 150 nautical miles (278 km) off the Falkland Islands, John Gilpin struck the underwater portion of an iceberg and began taking on water. One day later, the ship was abandoned. John Gilpin was a total loss, having accidentally caught fire with 15 feet (4.6 meters) of water in her hold. The British ship Hertfordshire, which was en route from Callao, Peru, to Cork, Ireland, picked up the crew and took them to Bahia, Brazil. On April 14, 1858, some of the crew members arrived in New York City aboard the clipper Sunny South.

The site was built during the Second World War, it was used during the war by the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a bomber station, and after the war as a transport airfield and bomb store before being \\"mothballed\\". In the 1950s, the RAF used the station as a training camp before it was transferred to the United States Air Force (USAF) as a reserve station during the Cold War. After USAF use, it became a testing airfield for Blackburn Aircraft and its successor British Aerospace until 1983, when the airfield was closed. Many of the airfield buildings survive as an industrial estate, but most of the runways have been demolished. Second World War =Construction and layout= Construction of the airfield began in late 1940, and the airfield was built with three concrete runways and hardstandings for 36 aircraft. The runway headings and lengths were as follows: :Main Runway 12/30 120¬∞ and 300¬∞ :Runway 04/22 40¬∞ and 220¬∞ :Runway 08/26 80¬∞ and 260¬∞ A year later, all three runways were extended; Runway 12/30 to , 04/22 to and 08/26 to . Three hangars were constructed, a and five Type T2s. The technical buildings, including the administration and control buildings, were to the north east of the runways. The accommodation area was further to the north east of the site, and at its maximum housed over 2,000 service personnel. This was well away from the munition stores, that were to the north west of the site. =Operational command and allocated units= A Handley Page Halifax of No. 1663 Heavy Conversion Unit based at Rufforth, Yorkshire, getting airborne from RAF Holme-on-Spalding Moor during a training flight, circa 1943 Operational command of the station was given to 1 Group of RAF Bomber Command. The first squadron allocated to Holme was 458 Squadron Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), equipped with Vickers Wellington aircraft. Arriving in August 1941, the squadron conducted its first operation in October 1941, and remained until January 1942. On or about 1 September 1941 the airfield was bombed as a secondary target after a raid on Newcastle with some loss of life. No squadrons were allocated until the extension of the runways was completed, and it was August 1942 before one flight of the Handley Page Halifax equipped 460 Squadron RAAF arrived. This stay only lasted a few weeks before the 460 Squadron aircraft left, and 101 Squadron RAF arrived on transfer from 3 Group. 101 Squadron was in the process of re-equipping with Avro Lancaster aircraft, and did not fly any operations until November 1942. In June 1943, a reorganisation of group boundaries within Bomber Command saw the station transferred from 1 Group to 4 Group. This change in command resulted in a change of squadrons, with 101 Squadron being replaced by the Halifax equipped 76 Squadron RAF. 76 Squadron remained at Holme until after the end of the war in Europe. 4 Group transferred from Bomber Command to RAF Transport Command in May 1945, and during its final weeks at Holme, 76 Squadron was re-equipped with the Douglas Dakotas. The Dakotas of 76 Squadron were replaced by the same of 512 Squadron in July 1945, before 512 Squadron left in October 1945. From February 1944 to May 1945, also based at Holme was 1689 Bomber (Defence) Training Flight that flew Hawker Hurricane aircraft on fighter affiliation duties. Also based at Holme during 1943‚Äì1944 was No. 1520 (Beam Approach Training) Flight RAF of 23 (Training) Group, RAF Flying Training Command flying Airspeed Oxford aircraft. After the departure of 512 Squadron, the base was reduced to \\"care and maintenance\\" status with just a small number of men to look after it. Part of the airfield was also used as store for surplus bombs. =Officers Commanding= * 1941‚Äì1942 Group Captain F E Nuttall * 1942 Group Captain A R Combe * 1942‚Äì1943 Group Captain R S Blucke RAF * April ‚Äì June 1943 Group Captain D E L Wilson RAAF. * June 1943 ‚Äì early 1944 Group Captain G S Hodson RAF * 1944‚Äì1945 Group Captain J E Pelly-Fry RAF * 1945 Group Captain R H Harris Cold War In 1951, with the Korean War still in progress, the decision was taken to expand the number of stations used for flying training. Holme was one of the airfields chosen, and in March 1952 No. 14 Advanced Flying Training School RAF (14 AFTS) was re-formed at Holme, flying Airspeed Oxford and Percival Prentice aircraft. This use of the airfield did not last long, and 14 AFTS was disbanded in January 1953. The station was then handed over to the United States Air Force while the proposed main airfield for the USAF in Yorkshire, Elvington was under development. The USAF use did not last long, and the airfield was returned to the RAF in 1957; however, the USAF had lengthened the runways, including extending Runway 12/30 to . Blackburn and British Aerospace Surplus to RAF requirements, Holme was leased to Blackburn Aircraft Ltd for use as a test base from 1958. The location was convenient for Blackburn's main factory at Brough Aerodrome, only away, where the runway was not long enough for use by the new aircraft Blackburn was then working on, most especially the Blackburn Buccaneer. The use of Holme passed through Blackburn's acquisition by Hawker Siddeley, and subsequently British Aerospace, until the latter ceased use of Holme in December 1983. Current use Most of the buildings still stand, and are used as an industrial estate. A memorial to the wartime squadrons stands at the main entrance.

It has been recorded throughout the North West Atlantic, as well as in the Gulf of Maine and South Africa. Description Alitta succinea in motion The clam worm can reach up to in length, but most specimens are smaller than this. It is brown colored at the rear, and reddish-brown on the rest of its body. It has an identifiable head with four eyes, two sensory feelers or palps, and many tentacles. The head consists of two segments: the anterior and posterior prostomium. The last body segment is known as the pygidium. Life cycle It is a freeswimming polychaete, scavenging on the bottom of shallow marine waters. It feeds on other worms and algae. To feed, it uses a proboscis, which has two hooks at the end, to grasp prey and draw it into its mouth. Clam worms are an important food source for bottom-feeding fish and crustaceans, though they can protect themselves by secreting a mucus substance that hardens to form a sheath around them. During lunar phases in the spring and early summer, the clam worm undergoes epigamy. Their parapodia enlarge so they can swim. The clam worms are then capable of releasing eggs and sperm. Soon after they have released their eggs or sperm, they die. Planktonic larvae develop, grow into adults and eventually sink to the bottom of the water.

Education Esfahani received his first guidance on the piano from his father before exploring an interest in the harpsichord as a teenager. He studied musicology and history at Stanford University, where he was mentored by George Houle, and studied harpsichord in Boston with Peter Watchorn, before completing his formation under Czech harpsichordist Zuzana R≈Ø≈æiƒçkov√°. Career A leading harpsichordist, Esfahani's programming and work in commissioning new compositions has drawn the attention of critics and audiences across Europe, Asia, and North America. He was the first harpsichordist to be a BBC Radio 3 New Generation Artist (2008‚Äì2010), and to be honoured by an award from the Borletti-Buitoni Trust (2009). He has also been a nominee for Gramophone Classical Music Awards Artist of the Year (2014, 2015, and 2017). His work for the harpsichord has resulted in recitals in major concert halls and events including the Wigmore Hall, London; the Konzerthaus Berlin; the Edinburgh International Festival; Oji Hall, Tokyo; the Forbidden City Concert Hall, Beijing; Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival, New York; the Al Bustan Festival, Beirut; and the Jerusalem Arts Festival.

In 1990, official relations started; Canada has dispatched an Honorary Consul to Windhoek. Refugees Canada is one of the main destinations for Namibian refugees. Together with Botswana and Denmark, Canada has been granting asylum to people fleeing Namibia in the aftermath of the Caprivi conflict, and particularly the Caprivi treason trial that followed in which the Namibian government was accused of human rights violations. Only in 2010 Canada has changed its standpoint and is now considering the CLA to be a terrorist organisation that has \\"attempted to usurp an elected government\\". Nonetheless, Canada received a steady inflow of Namibian immigrants who seek economic betterment under the pretense of humiliation and harassment in Namibia.

He is one of the world's most recognizable storybook characters and the official mascot to Scholastic. Concept and creation When Norman Bridwell was a child, he wanted to have a horse-sized dog for him to ride on. He did try riding on a horse once, but this horse was not very friendly to him. And so his idea was to write up a story, as well as illustrate, about a horse-sized dog who was quite friendly. In 1962, Bridwell tried to share his idea with his painting of a young girl and an oversized bloodhound to around fifteen publishing houses, but none of them were very interested. However, an editor of Harper & Row had his drawing and offhandedly suggested he would turn this drawing into a story for children. His wife, Norma, joined in the making of the story of a girl and an even bigger red dog, just about the size of a house. Bridwell originally planned to name a big red dog \\"Tiny\\", but Norma said that this name sounded stupid for a giant-sized dog, instead suggesting \\"Clifford\\" after her imaginary friend from her childhood. And this story soon became Clifford the Big Red Dog, published by Scholastic the following year. Character profile Clifford is a giant, friendly red dog who is owned by a young girl named Emily Elizabeth with whom he lives in New York City. The book of his debut, as narrated by his owner, detailed Clifford's versatility, great helpfulness, and his friendship with his friends, albeit as the books progressed they detailed his many experiences with Emily Elizabeth and adventures (such as gaining temporary celebrity status in one book) and the endless benefits presented by Clifford's unusual size and gentleness, or the occasional disadvantages at some points. Clifford's infancy is occasionally mentioned and depicted in a few books, in which he appears as a regular-sized, small puppy, albeit it has been mentioned that he later grew to tremendous proportions. While it is highly debated among fans, the creators of the show have confirmed that Clifford can grow and shrink depending on the life force of the children around him one. Although Clifford is depicted as a regular, semi-humanized dog aside from his size in the series of picture books, in the animated series adapted from the books he and his adoptive family live in the fictional island country, Birdwell Island, and is gifted with extra anthropomorphism, and capabilities of speech when conversing with other dogs. Several other characters were introduced in the animated series only, particularly Clifford's canine companions and their owners, most notably his two best friends; a flamboyant, stylish lavender purple poodle named Cleo (voiced by Cree Summer) and pudgy yellow Bull Terrier named T-Bone (voiced by Kel Mitchell). Other characters include a prideful sky blue Greyhound named Mac and a three-legged beagle named K.C. (both voiced by Cam Clarke). As opposed to detailing Clifford's experiences with humans or describing his escapades from a human's viewpoint, the episodes of the television program further explore Clifford's own viewpoint (as well as those of his canine acquaintances) and educational morals learned through their experiences, with the help of the capabilities presented by their ability to speak and hold conversations together. After this series ended its run, a new series was spun off entitled Clifford's Puppy Days, chronicling Clifford's youth as a tiny puppy before his family's relocation to Bridwell Island, the setting of the original animated program. Here, new characters are presented that appeared neither in the original storybooks nor the other series, such as Emily Elizabeth's neighbors and local animals and pets acquainted with Clifford during his babyhood. Such characters include Jorge (voiced by Jess Harnell), a Spanish dachshund owned by Emily's friend Nina (voiced by Masiela Lusha), Daffodil (voiced by Kath Soucie), a pink pet rabbit owned by Emily, Norville (voiced by Henry Winkler), a bird, among others. In the animated reboot, Clifford is portrayed as a playful and helpful dog who can talk to Emily Elizabeth, similar to the home video series in 1988 and unlike the original television series, and joins her to embark on adventures and explore their home island. The reboot also introduced several new characters, including Clifford's new canine friends; Bailey, an Australian Shepherd (voiced by Bahia Watson) owned by one of Emily's new friends Samantha Mulberry (voiced by Jenna Weir), Tucker, a Dalmatian puppy (voiced by Julie Lemieux) owned by Fire Chief Franklin (voiced by John Cleland), Hero, a beagle (voiced by Matt Folliott) owned by Pablo Flores (voiced by Niko Ceci), and Hudson, a Yorkshire Terrier (voiced by Markeda McKay) owned by Fisherman Charlie (voiced by Sugith Varughese).

Bull running was a medieval custom practiced in England until the 19th century. It involved chasing a bull through the streets of a town until it was weakened, then slaughtering the animal and butchering it for its meat. Bull running became illegal in 1835, and the last bull run took place in Stamford, Lincolnshire, in 1839. The practice was not confined to any particular region, with bull runs also documented at Axbridge in the south west, Canterbury and Wokingham in the south east, Tutbury in the midlands, and Wisbech in the east. The origins of the custom are uncertain, and the date of observance varied across the country. In Stamford, the bull run took place on St Brice's Day (13 November); in Tutbury, it was held on the Feast of the Assumption (15 August); and in Axbridge on Guy Fawkes Day (5 November). Origins The earliest documented instance of bull running appears in 1389, among medieval guild records collected by Joshua Toulmin Smith. The document‚Äîfrom Stamford's \\"Gild of St. Martin\\"‚Äîstates that \\"on the feast of St. Martin, this gild, by custom beyond reach of memory, has a bull; which bull is hunted [not baited] by dogs, and then sold; whereupon the bretheren and sisteren sit down to feast.\\" The phrase \\"custom beyond reach of memory\\" leaves uncertainty about whether the custom pre-dated the guild‚Äîwhich was established by 1329‚Äîor was instituted by the guild itself. Local folklore in Stamford maintained that the tradition was begun by William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, during the reign of King John (1199‚Äî1216). The story, recorded by Richard Butcher in his The Survey and Antiquitie of Stamford Towne (1646), and described by Walsh as \\"patently fictional\\", relates how Warenne: A similar origin-story involving a noble is found at Tutbury, Staffordshire, where the tradition was said to have been started by John of Gaunt shortly after he married his Spanish wife, Constance of Castile, in 1372, in an effort to remind her of her home. The story was first advanced‚Äîpurely as speculation‚Äîby Robert Plot in his The Natural History of Stafford-Shire (1686), where he writes: Samuel Pegge, addressing the Society of Antiquaries in 1765, dismissed Plot's conjecture as \\"entirely mistaken\\", while lamenting that it had become received wisdom in the interim. While John of Gaunt had established a Court of Minstrels at Tutbury in 1381, the bull running appears instead to have been instituted by the prior of Tutbury Priory (founded c.1080 as a dependency of the abbey at Saint-Pierre- sur-Dives) as part of the Feast of the Assumption celebrations which, as early as 1230, required the prior to provide \\"a great feast\\". Pegge also notes that the bull used for running was provided by the prior, and that the animal \\"was turned out antiently at the abbey-gate, and by the prior; John of Gaunt or his officers being no way employed in that service.\\" Walsh observed that the bull running that took place in November occurred in the calendar around Martinmas, which \\"traditionally marked the slaughtering time for the beef, swine and geese not being maintained through the winter on stored feed.\\" During the Anglo-Saxon period, November was called Bl≈çtm≈çna√æ (\\"sacrifice month\\") or Bl≈çdm≈çna√æ (\\"blood month\\"). Langeslag cautions: \\"Whether the [Anglo-Saxons'] slaughter was accompanied by a celebration, and whether such a celebration would have been secular or religious, is not known, although a twelfth-century reader of Bede gave the month name the explanation 'because this is when they offered the cattle to be killed to their gods'. Whether this should be read as speculation or report, it is certain that the necessary conditions for a gathering, secular or religious, were in place at this time of year.\\" William Fitzstephen, writing in 1173, indicates that, in London at least, the animals to be slaughtered were often first used for sport: \\"[T]he youth are entertained in a morning with boars fighting to the last gasp, as likewise with hogs full tusked, intended to be converted into bacon; or game-bulls, and bears of a large bulk, are baited with dogs.\\" See also *Stamford bull run *Bull-baiting * Bullfighting ** Spanish-style bullfighting * Bull-leaping (ancient) ** (modern France) ** (modern Spain) * (India) * Running of the bulls (Spain, Portugal, France, Mexico) ** or * Pacu jawi (bull race), Indonesia Notes and references Notes References Bibliography    * * Category:Blood sports Category:Bull sports Category:Cruelty to animals Category:Defunct sporting events Category:English traditions ","title":"Bull running"},{"id":"28234656","text":"John F.

The Carlson family immigrated to the United States in 1884, making their home in Buffalo, New York. Carlson attended evening art classes at the Art Students League of Buffalo, New York. There Carlson received instruction from Lucius Wolcott Hitchcock, a former pupil at the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris and the Art Students League of New York. Carlson won a scholarship in 1903 or 1904 to study with Lovell Birge Harrison at the Byrdcliffe Colony in Woodstock, New York. Carlson began exhibiting work in such national shows as the annual of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1905. From this period on, he maintained an active exhibition schedule and submitted works in a variety of media, though with particular success in watercolor and oil. In 1906, the Art Students League Summer School awarded Carlson his third scholarship to study Landscape painting. Carlson became a specialist in winter scenes and received an appointment as assistant director of Woodstock in 1908.John F.

Known as Wilson Point Road, the state highway runs from Dogwood Drive north to MD 150 within Middle River in southeastern Baltimore County. MD 587 provides access to Martin State Airport. The state highway was constructed in the mid-1930s from MD 150 to Wilson Point. MD 587's southern terminus was moved to its present spot in the mid-1980s. Route description View south from the north end of MD 587 at MD 150 in Middle River MD 587 begins at the intersection of Wilson Point Road and Dogwood Drive. Wilson Point Road continues south as a two-lane undivided county highway through a residential neighborhood toward the namesake promontory at the confluence of Stansbury Creek on the east and Middle River on the west. MD 587 heads north as a two- lane divided highway between Martin State Airport on the east and apartment complexes on the west. After passing the main entrance to Martin State Airport, the west side of the state highway is lined by Lockheed Martin's Middle River Complex. MD 587 reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with MD 150 (Eastern Boulevard) just south of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. History MD 587 was constructed as a macadam road along what was originally Bull Neck Road from MD 150 to Wilson Point in 1934. The state highway was widened with a pair of wide concrete shoulders around 1940. MD 587's intersection with MD 150 was rebuilt as a directional crossover intersection when MD 150 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway through Middle River in 1944. The intersection was converted to a standard three-way intersection when MD 587 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway along its present length in 1964. The state highway's southern terminus was moved north to Dogwood Drive around 1987. In 2017, the road was redone adding curbing on both sides and the center divider was widened to make this road one lane each way with a bicycle lane on the right. A sidewalk was added on the west side of the road running south from MD 150 (Eastern Boulevard) to the apartment complex attaching to an existing sidewalk running the rest of the way down Wilson Point Road. The original divider was concrete but the widened one has been changed to green space with grass and in some sections small bushes and runs to the end of MD 587.

He was born in Inder√∏y as a son of crofter Johan Berent Johannessen Volvollan and Lise Eliasdatter Kj√¶rbo. He attended Sund Folk High School from 1903 to 1904, but spent the rest of his youth as a worker. In 1908 he became chairman of his local trade union. He became a Norwegian Union of General Workers unionist in Trondheim, and became a national board member in 1913. He was also a member of the Dutch Radicals (refer to Fagopposisjonen av 1911), and through his fellow adherents (spearheaded by Martin Tranm√¶l) he was elected chairman of the Norwegian Union of General Workers in 1918 and deputy chairman of the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions in 1920. In 1923 he went on to become chairman of the newly created Norwegian Union of Building Workers. He was active in the Norwegian Labour Party, but when the party split in 1923 he joined the Communist Party of Norway. He was a central board member from 1923 to 1929 and politburo member from 1925 to 1929. Because of this he was removed as Norwegian Union of Building Workers leader in 1927, and instead became head of trade matters in the Communist Party of Norway. In 1929 he was also removed as member of the Confederation of Trade Unions secretariat together with Hans Aas. He chaired the party Arbeiderklassens Samlingsparti in 1927, but it was very short-lived. He left the Communist Party in 1929, and rejoined the Labour Party. He was secretary of the Confederation of Trade Unions from 1931 to 1934, when he was again removed. He instead became Confederation of Trade Unions secretary for Northern Norway in 1935, where he mainly travelled around and founded trade unions. In 1938 he returned as national secretary. He was married to Olufine Mathilde Vinje (1885‚Äì1953) from June 1909 to 1938, and then to Astrid Evensen (1890‚Äì1958) from July 1938. After the German invasion of Norway in 1940, the leadership of the Confederation of Trade Unions fled together with the royal family and government. Volan became acting leader from 13 April 1940. On 14 April he co-signed a petition to the people to remain calm under the new German rule (following the Lysaker Bridge sabotage). Volan was a member of the Nemnda for industri og omsetning, and participated in negotiations during the summer. Many trade unionists disliked his role. Nonetheless, he was removed by Germans in September 1940. Jens Tangen from Fagopposisjonen av 1940 was ordered by Germans to take over. Volan fled to Sweden, where he worked for the exiled part of the Confederation of Trade Unions. He was a Communist Party member for a brief time, but joined the Labour Party for the third time before 1945. After the war, he was not sanctioned for the time as trade union leader in occupied Norway. He continued as union secretary until retirement in 1953, being re-elected in 1946 and 1949. He was a member of the Labour Court of Norway from 1954 to 1957. He died in December 1974 in Oslo.

It was the third asylum in the state of Iowa. The hospital's many name variations include: The Clarinda Lunatic Asylum, The Clarinda State Asylum, The Clarinda Asylum for the Insane, and The Clarinda Mental Health Institute. It was built under the Kirkbride Plan. The original plan for patients was to hold alcoholics, geriatrics, drug addicts, mentally ill, and the criminally insane. In 2009, it was made public that, to save money, the state may close one of the four hospitals in Iowa. On June 30, 2015, the hospital facility was shut down and all patient services terminated. The Clarinda Academy, owned by Sequel Youth Services, is the sole occupant of the former hospital grounds. Description The Kirkbride is made of red brick with white trim in some areas. The administration section has a large clocktower and is kept in good condition to provide people with an idea of what the mental institution looked like when it was completed in 1886. Although the hospital looks like it did in 1886, the hospital has had many things replaced such as windows. Amenities have also been added such as electricity, running water, and other buildings including infirmaries and a minimum security prison that was established in 1980. Although things have been replaced and added, however, much of the original woodwork and tile floors in the hospital have been kept. History Prior to the construction of Clarinda, Iowa had two mental hospitals, in Independence and Mt. Pleasant, but these were overcrowded. Recognizing the need for a third, a state commission selected the city of Clarinda to serve as its home in 1884. William Foster and Henry F. Liebbe of Des Moines were retained as architects for the new facility. Construction began July 4, 1885, and the first patients of the then all-male institution took occupancy in 1888. The patients at the hospital were thought to be no longer human, and therefore, many were abused, and some even died.

The university moved its taught courses from the site to new facilities at its main Plymouth campus. History The college opened in 1946, and initially graduates were awarded a Certificate in Education by the University of Exeter. In 1988, Rolle College became part of Polytechnic South-West, and in 1990 was absorbed into Plymouth University. The last three Students' Union Presidents of Rolle College were Katie Shaw (05/06), Fiona House (06/07) and Michael Austin (07/08). The Exmouth campus was closed in 2008, when Plymouth University relocated the college, its 3000 students and 400 staff to their main campus in Plymouth. Rolle played a significant part in the life of Exmouth, both economically and socially. The decision to relocate the campus was controversial with past and present students, staff and the local community. Anti-closure demonstrations and campaigns lasted until the relocation. With the premises becoming vacant, and with Exmouth no longer being home to a community of students, a Community Benefit Company (Rolle Exmouth Limited, or REL) was set up in 2010 to find new uses for the site that would benefit the community. Plans were drawn up in conjunction with Plymouth University to retain part of the site for a mixture of uses including educational and vocational training, business incubation, and community facilities; the plans included disposal of a significant part of the site for housing development. Negotiations appeared to be proceeding well (though slowly), when Plymouth University suddenly announced, on 1 September 2016, that contracts had been exchanged with the Exeter Royal Academy for Deaf Education, under which the Academy would acquire the entire site and relocate there from its existing premises in Exeter.Letter from James Brent, Chairman of the Board of Governors, University of Plymouth, to Deborah Hallett, chair of Rolle Exmouth Limited, dated 1 Sept 2016; distributed to the REL mailing list, but not otherwise published.

He fought 60 times between 1951 and 1963; winning 50 (24 by knockout) and losing 10. The highlight of Gomes's career came in 1959 when he won the world super featherweight title against Paul Jorgensen. Professional career Gomes fought as a professional for the first time in September 1951 at the age of 18. His debut was against Billy St Pierre at the Rhode Island Auditorium in his hometown, the venue for his first thirteen professional fights. Billy St Pierre was knocked out in the second round, giving Gomes his first professional victory. Gomes remained undefeated until January 1954, when he lost a ten-round decision to Tommy Tibbs, a man that Gomes had beaten twice in 1952 and once in 1953. In March 1954 Gomes claimed the first title of his career when he beat Johnny O'Brien, via a twelve-round unanimous decision, for the USA New England featherweight title at the Boston Garden. Gomes suffered two knockout defeats in the second half of 1954, both to Tibbs in Boston. Following his second knockout loss to Tibbs, Gomes won twelve fights in a row, including a rematch against O'Brien for the New England title. His run of victories was ended in August 1957 when he lost a unanimous ten-round decision to Isidro Martinez at the Boston Arena. After eight successive victories following his loss to Martinez, Gomes fought for the vacant world super featherweight title against Jorgensen, a man he had defeated earlier in the year, in July 1959. The fight lasted the fifteen round distance, with Gomes knocked down four times and Jorgensen repeatedly cautioned for low blows. The scorecards of the judges were all in favour of Gomes, thus making him the new world champion. Following his world title victory, Gomes was named The Rings Fighter of the Month. Gomes's world title reign was ended in his first defence, when he lost to the Filipino challenger Flash Elorde in March 1960. Gomes, who was the betting favourite, was fighting outside the United States for the first time, as the contest was held at the Araneta Coliseum (now SMART Araneta Coliseum) in Quezon City. The sellout crowd of 26,000 watched Elorde knock Gomes down five times en route to a seventh-round knockout victory. A rematch took place in August at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. Elorde claimed the victory after one minute and twenty seconds of the opening round. Elorde scored a knockdown with a left hand to the face, and although Gomes was able to rise to his feet at the count of seven, he was knocked out with a combination soon after. Gomes did not participate in a world title fight again in his career, which contained eight further fights. After four successive wins, he lost a split decision to Johnny Bizzarro before being knocked out in his final three professional fights, including his final fight, a one-round knockout defeat to Dave Coventry in October 1963, in London.

Murphy joined the team during the 1969 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until he left the panel after the 1970 championship. During that time he won one Munster medal. An All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion, Murphy also won a set of All-Ireland and National Hurling League medals as a non-playing substitute. At club level Murphy played with Passage West. Playing career =Inter-county= Murphy first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork under-21 team in 1968 and enjoyed immediate success. Tipperary were bested by 4-10 to 1-13 in the provincial decider to secure a Munster medal. MUrphy was later at midfield for the All-Ireland decider against Kilkenny. A 2-18 to 3-9 victory gave him an All-Ireland medal in that grade. In 1969 Murphy joined the Cork senior team for the championship campaign. He was an unused substitute for Cork's Munster final defeat of Tipperary and was also part of the extended panel for an All- Ireland showdown with Kilkenny. The team suffered a setback before the game when midfielder Justin McCarthy broke his leg in a motorcycle accident. In spite of this Cork led at the interval and looked a good bet for the victory, particularly after Kilkenny forward Pat Delaney left the field on a stretcher. Murphy was introduced as a substitute as the Rebels were still to the good coming into the last quarter, however, Kilkenny scored five unanswered points in the last seven minutes to win by 2-15 to 2-9. In spite of the All-Ireland defeat, Cork regrouped during the 1969-70 National League. Murphy was an unused substitute as an aggregate 5-21 to 6-16 defeat of New York in the decider gave Cork the National Hurling League title. Later that year he made his first championship start in a Munster semi-final defeat of Limerick and subsequently collected his first Munster medal following a 3-10 to 3-8 defeat of Tipperary. Cork later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Wexford providing the opposition in the very first eighty-minute championship decider. Murphy, in spite of starting Cork's other championship games, was dropped from the starting fifteen and played no part in the 6-21 to 5-10 victory.

He has played for the New York Yankees and the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB), and the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). He also played for the Mexico national team at the World Baseball Classic. High school and college career Laird attended La Quinta High School in Westminster, California. He was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 27th round of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft. He did not sign, opting to attend Cypress College, where he played college baseball for the Cypress Chargers. Professional career =New York Yankees= The New York Yankees selected Laird in the 27th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Yankees. On August 2, 2010, Laird was promoted from the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class AAA International League. Laird was named both the Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year of the Eastern League in 2010, following a breakout season. Following the 2010 season, he was added to the Yankees' 40 man roster in order to protect him from the Rule 5 Draft. New York Yankees in 2011 Laird was promoted to the majors for the first time on July 18, 2011, when Ramiro Pe√±a was placed on the disabled list. On July 22, at Yankee Stadium, Laird made his major league debut, and got his first major league hit and RBI against Oakland Athletics pitcher Craig Breslow on a single to center field. He scored his first run earlier in the game, scoring on a single by Nick Swisher after working a walk off of A's pitcher Joey Devine. The Yankees designated Laird for assignment on August 27, 2012. =Houston Astros= Laird was claimed by the Houston Astros on September 1, 2012.

On the final day of the All Star break, Fighters third base coach Shirai took Laird out to dinner at a local sushi restaurant to get him to relax. The chef, a big Fighters fan, suggested that Laird should act like he is making sushi when he got into the batter's box to intimidate the pitcher. The next day, he did not do the gesture getting into the batter's box, but after he hit a home run, he acted like he was making sushi and thus the nickname \\"sushi boy\\" was born. He started to gain momentum after that performance and had a nice second half, finishing his first season in NPB with 34 home runs and a batting average of .231. In 2016, Laird led the Pacific League with 39 home runs. He hit the game-winning home run in Game 4 of the 2016 Japan Series, and a grand slam in Game 6.

Five years later, in 1960, Wappen Von Hamburg was sold to the Greek Nomikos Line. She was renamed Delos and refitted as one of the first luxury Aegean cruise ships, with the addition of a swimming pool and air conditioning in all cabins.Chris Willson and Peter Knego, Aurora Yacht News, Wordpress, August 26, 2012, retrieved October 11, 2020. In 1967 the ship was sold to the Alaska Cruise Line (Westtours) of Vancouver and renamed to Polar Star for expedition cruises in Alaskan waters, then in 1970 resold to West Cruise Lines of Panama and renamed to Pacific Star and then Polar Star for expedition cruises in the South Atlantic. In 1972 Donald L. Ferguson bought her, renamed her Xanadu, and added antiques to her luxury fittings.\\"M/S Wappen von Hamburg\\", Faktaomfartyg.se, retrieved October 11, 2020 . As the cruise industry began to fade, Xanadu was sold two further times and then in 1977 laid up and some of her fittings were auctioned. After repossession by a Seattle bank in Vancouver, she was sold in 1982 to Pan Aleutian Seafoods as a factory ship for crab, and in 1984 laid up again, in Tacoma. In 1985 a new owner renamed her again to Expex and moored her at Los Angeles for trade show and exhibition use. A forty-foot intermodal container was mounted on her stern. After this venture was unsuccessful, the ship was sold to Friendships, a Christian sect based in Wilmington, California, who renamed her Faithful. They repainted her hull blue but instead of using her for relief work, housed converts on the ship until she was seized by the Coast Guard. Dr. James Mitchell bought Faithful from Friendships to use as a hospital ship, but resold her to in 2005 Dr. Mitchell sold the Faithful, which by now had rusting metal, fading and peeled paint, and missing railings, to Al Boraq Aviation, who planned to refurbish her as a luxury yacht and had her towed to Alameda. This refurbishment did not materialize; she was declared an abandoned vessel and eventually an arrangement was made to have her removed. In 2010 the Life After People episode \\"Holiday Hell\\" featured the ship with an interview with maritime enthusiast Peter Knego on her history and condition.Martin Cox, \\"Life after Knego\\", Maritime Matters, February 6, 2010. After seeing a Craigslist ad in 2008, Chris Willson bought the ship from the then owner, a marine salvage dealer who had been ordered by the California State Lands Commission to move the ship from Decker Island, in the San Joaquin River delta, but could not afford to do so. Willson had her towed to Rio Vista, where restoration work began, and then a year later, in August 2010, renamed Aurora, to Pier 38 in San Francisco, with plans to eventually open her as a tourist attraction.Peter Knego, \\"AURORA arrives in San Francisco\\", Maritime Matters, August 1, 2010, archived from the original on August 8, 2010.

The islands contain about 7,100,000 tonnes of nickel which is about 10% of the world's nickel reserves. With the annual production of about 107,000 tonnes in 2009, New Caledonia was the world's fifth largest producer after Russia (266,000), Indonesia (189,000), Canada (181,000) and Australia (167,000). Nickel production in New Caledonia accounts for 7‚Äì10% the country's GDP and is responsible for as much as 80% towards foreign earnings. With the exclusion of tourism, nickel ore and derived metallurgical products represent about 97% of the total value of exports. History New Caledonia has the longest history of mining in the Pacific islands. Nickel was found in New Caledonia in 1864 by the engineer Jules Garnier. It was distributed in the ore layers which cover about one third of the area of the main island of New Caledonia. The nickel concentration was inhomogeneous and also varied with the depth. Whereas its usual concentration was 2‚Äì5 percent, it could reach 10‚Äì15 percent in scattered deposits of green garnierite. Those areas were developed first using primitive manual extraction methods and were gradually depleted, resulting in the present average concentration of about 2.6 percent. This nickel is located at the depth of about . Shallower layers of also contain nickel, but at half of the concentration. They remain unexploited and constitute most of the nickel reserves of New Caledonia. Wide-scale mining started in 1875 in Houa√Ølou and Canala communes. Early mining was done by hand and then gradually became mechanised. By beginning of the 20th century two large mines at Bourai and Thio were established. In the initial years, after nickel was discovered mining was done in about 330 mines. However, in 1981 there were only 30 functional mines as against 130 in the early 1970s. Because of the remote location of the islands, about half of the ore was smelted locally, despite the underdeveloped industrial infrastructure of New Caledonia. Another half was exported, mainly to Japan. The first nickel smelter was built in 1879 with two other added in 1910 and 1913. The smelted product contained about 70‚Äì80% nickel and was sent for refining to France. Because of low nickel content in the ore, local smelting resulted in vast amount of displaced rocks near the smelters that changed the local landscape. In the 1930s, the white 'Caldoches' and companies like the Soci√©t√© le Nickel dominated the economies of the colony. The native Melanesians were confined to reservations which made up only 10 per cent of New Caledonia's land area.https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781349108305 The main source of mine labor came from Asian migrants recruited by France. The arrival of these migrants from India, Japan, China, Java, and Vietnam both increased and changed the demographics of New Caledonia's population. By the 1920s, Asians outnumbered the French. The production of ore was nearly constant between 1875 and 1948, but then increased about 70 times reaching a peak of about 8 million tonnes in 1971, at which time New Caledonia was the second largest nickel producer in the world. In the second half of the 1960s, the nickel industry experienced rapidly increasing demand linked to the Vietnam War.https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781349108305 New Caledonia's exports had quadrupled over the past decade. This rise followed by a decline, to about 4 million tonnes of ore in 1981, due to cyclones, reducing demand for the metal and increasing role of other world producers, such as Indonesia, Philippines and Australia. Correspondingly, the mined area decreased from and the number of people employed in the industry from about 6,200 to about 3,600. Nearly half of them worked at the mines and another half at the major Doniambo processing plant near Noumea. Mines Strip mining is the most common technique adopted for nickel mining and statistics show that stripping of 500 million tonnes of overburden had to be removed to extract nickel ore, which amounted to clearing an area of per million tonne (five million tonnes of ore per year generate 25 million tonnes of tailings). The local nickel industry is dominated by the French company Eramet which has a 60% interest in its nickel mining subsidiary, SLN (Societe Le Nickel) in New Caledonia. Other firms such as Falconbridge Ltd., Inco, Argosy Minerals and QNI however are still active in New Caledonia, particularly Inco in the Goro mine which produces both nickel and cobalt, about 54,000 tonnes of nickel annually. Despite a decline in the nickel mining, New Caledonia remains one of world's largest producers of laterite, a source of ferronickel (an alloy of iron and nickel) which constitutes about 20% of country's production. Another 80% is nickel extracted from saprolite.Susan Wacaster, The Mineral Industry of New Caledonia, USGS, 2008 In 2008, New Caledonian ferro-nickel was mostly exported to the European Union (41.8%), Japan (18.2%), Taiwan (18.2%), China (8.0%), India, South Africa, South Korea (2.4%) and the United States. On the contrary, all smelted nickel is sent to France. The major mines are Goro, Thio, Koniambo, Kouaoua, Nepoui ‚Äì Kopeto and Etoile du Nord. Recently the new Tiebaghi mine has been opened which will be responsible for some 30% of SLN's annual production, accounting to 20,000 tonnes per year. =Goro Nickel Plant= Goro Nickel Plant, is one of the largest hydrometallurgical process plants constructed, estimated to cost $3.2bn, with a design capacity of 60,000 tonnes of nickel per annum. The nickel is extracted from laterite, with proven reserves of 120 million tonnes. Cobalt is also being produced here from saprolite deposits. Opencast extraction to depths of 50‚Äì60 m is being employed (the shallower layers have no commercial value). The major share in the Plant is held by a consortium with Vale Inco (of Brazil) holding a 69% share and a joint company called Sumic Nickel Netherlands, Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Ltd., and Mitsui Co. Ltd., holding 21%.share. However in 2020 Vale is in the process of selling all of its interest to New Century mining.https://www.australianmining.com.au/news/vale-departs-new-caldonia-as- a-new-century-dawns/ The three provinces of New Caledonia hold the balance 10% share. The project was stalled for a while as the local community of Kanak people stiffly opposed the project, particularly of laying the offshore line. As of 2014 pollution into the lagoon was a problem and there were shutdowns. Environmental impact due to nickel mining Even though the nickel mining operation is crucial to the economy of the region, its environmental adverse impacts on the environment and ecology have invited protests from the Environmental lobbies. The environmental groups, with its social and political undertones are seeking remedial measures to redress mines' landscape impacts and the ecological aspects. Some of the impacts brought out are the following. Ramsar Organization dealing with wetlands has brought out a few adverse effects from the nickel mining operations on the wetlands in the interior regions of New Caledonia. Many wetlands have either been lost or spoiled. Rivers and streams have been choked with tailings from the waste material dumped from the nickel mines. This has resulted in rise in bed levels of the rivers and consequent flooding affecting fertile agricultural lands. Many river delta areas have been affected creating changes in aquatic flora and fauna; the mining effluents are reported to have affected about 40 streams in their middle and lower reaches. Even estuaries and bays are reportedly affected by the ‚Äúred clay and lateritic sub-soil,‚Äù which covers some of the mangrove forests. During the boom period of nickel extraction in the state, there were serious visible effects on the environment, consequent to stripping of hill slopes. Erosion of hill slopes are reported to have continued, even after closure of some open cut mines in the Theo Mining Centre on the east coast of the main island. It is reported that the Thio centre provides, especially its Plateau mine (Theo Mining centre once produced 20 million tonnes of nickel ore), the most striking example of the environmental damage caused by mining activity in New Caledonia. A study carried out in 1991 had observed that 1 million tonnes of solid mass of dumped material from the nickel mines caused shift of the delta of a lagoon by about 300 m due to sedimentation. However, it is also observed that nickel mining is a \\"politically sensitive subject...it remains the most important economic sector on the island‚Äù. Studies done at Noum√©a (the capital of the Island) had established that the flumes from nickel factories jetted out a plume of black and red smoke. The discharges from the factories had also recorded high levels of nickel, arsenic and lead, apart from phenol, hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide, PCB and pyraline. The head of the bay area also recorded higher levels of nitrites, nitrates and phosphates. Mines now in operation are better managed under opencast mining as compared to the past. However, according to environmental impact studies carried out, two new large nickel mining and processing plants have been identified as detrimental to the adjoining coral reefs and also to plant and animal species. Planned mitigation measures may still eliminate some adapted species. Pollution abatement measures The government of New Caledonia has evolved strategies, technologies and policies to maintain the balance between environmental conservation measures and mining industry. The new legislation has ensured enforcement of installing pollution abatement equipment followed by re-plantation of vegetation after mine is exploited, and technological improvements for efficient economic extraction concomitant with environmental friendly pollution control measures. The government regulations have been effectively adopted by mine inspectors and through environmental impact assessments since 1992, even though regulations have been existence for 15 years prior to that. Apart from introducing new techniques, other measures adopted for environmental abatement are: 14 zones covering have been declared protected areas from prospecting or mining, construction of sedimentation barriers, catchment area treatment, creation of settlement basin and terraces to reduce silt flow into streams and rivers, minimum road building activity in the area of mining, creation of a vegetation barrier along roads and in the vicinity of the mines, adopt satellite remote sensing techniques for mapping and locating mining areas which would avoid road building for the purpose and completely re-vegetate the closed or fully extracted mines. In addition, a monitoring team of inspectors of mines is also instituted to check and ensure that pollution abatement measures are fully implemented. In 1994, a mining centre was set up at Nepoui-Kopeto not only to increase productivity levels by adopting modern mining methods but also to develop pollution control capabilities at mining sites.

He was a French-American doctor, electrician, businessman and famous politician of Jewish German descent, implicated in the Panama scandals. Personal life Cornelius‚Äôs German parents, Adelaide (n√©e Friedmann from Bavaria) and Leopold Herz, emigrated from Hesse to the United States in 1848. They settled in the State of New York and by 1853 they had all become naturalized American citizens in New York City. Cornelius entered the College of the City of New York in 1858 and in 1861 he was a lieutenant in the United States army. He graduated with honours from the College of the City of New York in 1864. With a Bachelor of Science and Master of Arts, he went to study at the Universities of Heidelberg and of Paris. After matriculating at the School of Medicine of Paris, he became surgeon-major on the staff of General Chanzy in the French army of the Loire when the Franco-German War broke out in 1870 and was made Knight of the Legion of Honour in January 1871, for his distinguished services. In the spring of the same year he was appointed medical officer of the Maritime Hospital of Berck-sur-Mer. In the fall of 1871 Cornelius returned to America and arrived in Chicago, where his parents were living at the time, to witness the Great Chicago Fire. He was immediately charged with a medical sanitary mission in connection with, and during, its reconstruction. In 1872, he was elected Chief Medical Officer of the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. In 1873 he married in Boston the daughter of one of his patients, Bianca Saroni, and the following year they moved to San Francisco, where he was appointed a member of the Board of Health. Here he specialized in nervous illnesses and his attention was drawn to the adaptation of electricity to practical purposes and he founded the California Electrical Works. In September 1877, with George Prescott, Thomas Edison signs an agreement with Stephen Field and Cornelius Herz regarding European quadruplex patents. Career In 1877 Cornelius and Bianca Saroni returned to Paris with their two infant daughters, Irma and Edna. Their son Ralph was born here, who later became a famous stage actor and three more daughters, Olga, Sybil and Adelaide. In Paris he became the head of the movement for extending the use of electricity, which had its headquarters there. He founded the Electric-Force Transmission Company under the Marcel Deprez patents. According to an article by Sir Edward James Reed, which appeared in the Fortnightly Review of January, 1897: He founded and edited the first scientific reviews on electricity, La Lumiere Electrique and the Journal d‚ÄôElectricite\`. At this time he also, with the most important banks of Paris, founded societies for electric lighting and for telephony in many European countries. In conjunction with the banking house of Rothschilds, the Northern Railway of France, and the Creuzot Works, he established the Society for the Construction and Maintenance of Electrical Machinery, Apparatus, Cables, etc., the Society for Brazing by Electricity, the Society for the Manufacture of a Special System of Small-bore Guns, the Society for the Application of Electric Light to Railway Trains, the Society for the Construction of Telephone Apparatus, etc. He was the originator and principal founder of the Society for Working the State Telephonic-Telegraphic Trunk Lines, with a capital of 100,000,000 francs, a gigantic scheme to interconnect the 36,000 communes of France by a perpetual day and night uninterrupted telephonic-telegraphic service, and to connect villages and the smallest hamlets at a uniform rate (names and addresses free) of one half- penny per word.‚Äù In 1878 the Government made him Officer of the Legion of Honour. President Garfield appointed Dr. Herz an official representative of the United States Government to the International Congress of Electricians in Paris in 1881 and that same year he was raised to the rank of Commander of the Legion of Honour. In 1879 he formed the Paris Electric-Light Company and in 1880 he invented a telephone system that assured a better transmission of the voice over long distance. In 1883 Herz was the founder, along with Alphonse de Rothschild, of the American Syndicate of Electricity, which afterwards amalgamated with the Westinghouse Syndicate. In 1886, he became Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour. Dr. Herz‚Äôs whole life up to 1892 was devoted to work, to great enterprises, and to science, and his efforts in these paths were applauded by the vast majority of the members of the French Academy of Sciences, by different Governments, and by many of the world‚Äôs greatest men. He received high distinctions from the Government of Bavaria, where he was made Commander of the Holy Order of St. Michael, and from King Umberto I who created him Grand Cross of the Order of St. Maurice and Lazare of Italy. He soon acquired a prominent position in the political world of France. Panama scandal Dr. Herz was in England, where they had always passed the winter, with his family in 1892, when the Panama scandals broke upon France. Dr. Herz was appealed to by members of the Government then in power to return to France, which he did. Soon after, Baron Jacques de Reinach committed suicide and Dr. Herz returned to the Tankerville Hotel in Bournemouth. Some believe that a perfectly innocent man, Dr. Herz, was made a scapegoat for certain foreign intrigues which had grown very powerful. It was common knowledge in Paris that Baron Reinach and Dr. Herz had been associated together during a dozen years and more in vast commercial undertakings, involving financial transactions amounting to many millions. The pursuit of Dr. Herz was aided by the greed of some persons in the camp of the Reinachs, who sought to acquire fortune through the downfall of a man whom they now were only too willing to consider an adversary, by taking advantage of the tragic circumstances attending the Baron‚Äôs death, and of the confusion in which he had left his affairs. It was also believed that Dr. Herz held evidence against prominent politicians and financiers. Georges Clemenceau's political judgement was called into question by his flirtation with the demagogic General Boulanger and by his friendship with the \\"crooked financier\\", Cornelius Herz, who was heavily implicated in the Panama Scandal. Clemenceau blamed Herz for having lost his seat in the 1893 parliamentary elections; he looked for a time to be finished politically. The charge thus artificially fixed upon by the French Government was alleged extortion from the late Baron Reinach ‚Äì a preposterous charge that was never adduced by the Baron himself in his lifetime, and had no visible foundation in law or in fact. But first, in order to evade the Legion of Honour difficulty, which prohibited an ordinary magistrate from acting, the French Government were compelled to resort to having Dr. Herz struck off the rolls of the Legion of Honour, which they did, contrary to the statutes of the Order of the Legion, without a prior hearing. In order to stop his counsel from producing his proofs of Baron de Reinach‚Äôs debt to Dr. Herz (consisting of documents on stamped paper duly dated and signed by the Baron, and held by the Rothschilds in their bank) the presiding Judge took advantage of the technicality that the documents were insufficiently stamped, a pure oversight doubtless on the part of men of business, and required that a fine amounting to about L 50,000 sterling should be paid before their introduction as evidence be admitted. This was prohibitory, and absolute conclusive evidence of a debt was, although examined by the Judges and tacitly admitted to be true, suppressed by the Court. Shortly afterwards another occasion presented itself to impoverish Dr. Herz by compelling his wife to transfer to him property which had always stood in her name. The pretext for this course seems to have been that the Judges of the Court alleged that the property was purchased with Dr. Herz‚Äôs money, and therefore should have been in his name. Various properties of Dr. and Mrs. Herz in Paris and Aix-lesBains were practically confiscated and torn from him. His Paris property, which had been constantly increasing in importance, was sold for several million francs less than its true value. It is also a fact that during the very time the French were persecuting Dr. Herz, by processes in the Civil and Criminal Courts in Paris, by utilizing the Extradition Treaty with England, and by public vilification through the Parisian Press ‚Äì who accused him of being a traitor, a spy in the pay of England, an incendiary, a murderer, and guilty of a whole host of minor crimes ‚Äì prominent members of the various Governmental and Opposition groups were constantly giving assurances to Madame Herz, and friends of the Doctor, as well as to his legal representatives, that all would soon be ‚Äúset right.‚Äù After keeping Dr. Herz under wrongful arrest for three and a half years, the French Government withdrew their charges and said they had made a mistake. The shocking treatment for so many years inflicted upon Dr. Herz was pronounced an absolute prosecution. In 1906, eight years after his death, he was exonerated completely. Tomb The embalmed bodies of Cornelius and his father Leopold were supposed to be kept temporarily at Willesden Jewish Cemetery in London, before being taken to America, but the relocation did not happen and eventually the bodies were buried at Willesden: Leopold in section B, row R1, grave 8, on 24 August 1896; Cornelius in section K, row G, grave 3, on 11 July 1898.Francesca Kautz e-mail 29 August 2019 References   * External links *DR CORNELIUS HERZ, A Curious Story *DR.

In October 1989 the squadron was redesignated Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Special Five (HCS-5), it adopted the name \\"Firehawks\\" and it traded in its \\"Hueys\\" for HH-60H Seahawk Combat Search and Rescue helicopters. The squadron was deactivated on 13 December 2006.  Genesis of the HA(L) squadrons  In 1966, United States Naval Special Warfare Command rotary support was originated as part of the response to the ongoing Vietnam War. Starting with Helicopter Combat Support Squadron ONE (HC-1), detachments of helicopter gunships supported the Mobile Riverine Force (also known as the Brown-water navy) effort in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam.GlobalSecurity.org: HC-1 HC-1 \\"Fleet Angels\\" operated two-aircraft detachments of UH-1B gunships, staged from amphibious vessels. Providing a quick reaction force and performing a close air-support (CAS) role for units of the Navy's Special Warfare Groups and the Mobile Riverine Force, the effectiveness of the helicopter attack mission was quickly realized and in response, the Navy began to widen the mission,BlueHawksofHAL-5.org creating the need for a specific Squadron to provide that support. In April 1967, HC-1 was divided into four separate units, Helicopter Attack Squadron (Light) 3 (HA(L)-3) (Navy Gunships), Helicopter Combat Support Squadron THREE (Navy Vertical Replenishment), Helicopter Combat Support Squadron FIVE (LAMPS), and Helicopter Combat Support Squadron Seven (Navy Combat Search and Rescue). at anchor in the Mekong Delta, South Vietnam. On deck are two HA(L)-3 \\"Seawolf\\" UH-1B Huey gunships from the squadrons Det Four or Det Six assigned to the ship. HH-1Ks over South Vietnam Nicknamed the \\"Seawolves\\", HA(L)-3 was established in South Vietnam with its headquarters originally in Vung Tau and later at Binh Thuy Air Base, originally flying in support of Operation Game Warden, earned over 20,000 unit and personnel awards. HA(L)-3 was disestablished in 1972 and in 1997, the US Navy recognized the service of the squadrons aircrew, retroactively awarding the Combat Aircrew Insignia to Combat Aircrewmen who served in HA(L)-3.www.seawolf.org HA(L)-3 Operational Base for Operation Game Warden  Birth of the Blue Hawks  Four years after the disestablishment of HA(L)-3, the Navy determined that it still had a need for the Navy Gunship, establishing two new Helicopter Attack (Light) Squadrons in the Naval Reserves as part of the newly formed Commander, Helicopter Wing Reserve (COMHELWINGRES) in 1976. Helicopter Attack Squadron (Light) FIVE (HA(L)-5), nicknamed the \\"Blue Hawks\\", was established at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, California on the 1 March 1977 and its sister squadron, Helicopter Attack Squadron (Light) FOUR (HA(L)-4), known as the Red Wolves, was formed at Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia on 1 July 1976. Given the mission of providing support to the Naval Special Warfare Command in support of Navy SEALs, EOD, and Navy Special Boat Units, flying the HH-1K Iroquois, the Navy once again had Gunships to support its special warfare operations. The HH-1K, possessing the same firepower as the UH-1B aircraft used by the HA(L)-3 Sea Wolves, had greater lift capability and allowed the aircraft to carry a higher payload. Outfitted with the M-21 weapons subsystem, it included two co-pilot controlled GAU-2B/A miniguns, two pilot-controlled rocket launchers, with a total of fourteen 2.75 inch Folding Fin Aerial Rockets (FFAR), and two crew operated M60 light machineguns. The aircraft was also equipped with a crew- controlled rescue hoist, although its primary mission did not include Combat Search and Rescue and the crews did include Rescue Swimmers. M-21 Weapon System With the proliferation and modernization of weapons technology in the four years since Vietnam, HA(L)-5 aircraft and crews deployed new countermeasures and tactics to defeat the changing combat threat environment,introducing Night Vision Goggles (NVG) and a flight profile called Nap-of-the-Earth (NOE), the aircrews learned to avoid detection by enemy forces and minimize the threat of hand-held infra-red seeking missile systems. The squadron, consisting of eight HH-1K Iroquois helicopters, 40 flight crewmen, and 150 maintenance and support personnel, operated from a home base at NAS Point Mugu, California in support of the Commander of the Naval Special Warfare Group at the Naval Amphibious Base, Coronado, California and made deployments to countries such as Egypt and South Korea. SEALs Fast Rope out of HH-1K of HA(L)-4  Changing of the guard; re-designation to Helicopter Combat Support Special Squadron 5 (HCS-5)  In 1983, a proposal was made to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) to combine the mission of the Naval Special Warfare Support mission of HA(L)-5 and HA(L)-4 with the Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) Mission of Helicopter Combat Support Squadron NINE (HC-9), nicknamed the \\"Protectors\\".GlobalSecurity.org: HC-9 Two new squadrons, replacing three in the United States Navy Reserve, with the new aircraft significantly more capable of surviving in high-threat environments and able to operate from a wider variety of Navy ships. In conjunction with the United States Coast Guard, the US Navy undertook the development of the new CSAR helicopter, designated HH-60H Rescue Hawk in the USN and HH-60J Jayhawk in the USCG.www.guncopter.com 20 October 1988 HA(L)-5 was re-designated Helicopter Combat Support Special Squadron FIVE (HCS-5), nicknamed the \\"Firehawks\\" operating the new HH-60H helicopters.GlobalSecurity.org: HSC-5 HCS-5 would remain at NAS Point Mugu for several years before moving to NAS North Island, the original home of HC-9. Most of the original HA(L)-5 personnel and crew remained with the squadron when it was re-designated and transitioned to the new helicopter. Some former members of the disestablished HC-9 also joined the squadron. HCS-5 was ultimately deactivated on 31 December 2006. On 1 March 2012 the Blue Hawk name was resurrected by Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 78, HSM-78 when it was established on that date. In attendance were a contingent of HAL-5 personnel, most long retired, that were present to pass the torch to the new Blue Hawks.

History  Chromite ore was first discovered in 1877 as sparse blocks on top of Tiebaghi plateau at 580 m elevation. From 1902 to 1920 Cr ore was extracted in an open pit 100 m deep, 200 m wide. From 1927 the mine was operated underground and was the largest chromium mine in the world in 1941. Broken Hills properties owned Tiebaghi and its director of operation was Mr. Raoul Bergman, from 1949 til 1952, while having an affair with the wife of one of its operation managers, Mr. R L Petit. An accident occurred in 1951, when two young engineers, Mr. White and Mr. Alexander, were killed by dynamite explosion. During a fist fight between Mr. Bergman and Mr. Petit, the director was baldy injured and was sent to Noumea for evaluation and treatment and then sent to Australia on board on a QANTAS sea plane and with his new lady friend Mrs. Josephine Petit. Incidentally Mrs. Petit, who was the director of the school in Tiebaghi, left behind husband and 6 kids ranging from the age of 5 to 15. Mrs. Bergman stayed in Tiebaghi for a short time and she also left New Caledonia soon after and returned to the United States when she died a short time later. The mine closed for the first time in 1962. Mining resumed in 1982 with a new access drift, 1.2 km long, which was opened from the NE flank of the massif to reach the base of the orebody. All operations ceased in 1990. Ti√©baghi mine belongs to a group of orebodies aligned parallel to the layering of peridotite host rock in a NW-SE direction and dipping about 70¬∞ to the SW. Tiebaghi mine produced about 54,000 tons per year.The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia During World War II it produced about 4400 tons of nickel per year. A bulk of 3.27 Mt chromite ore has been extracted from Ti√©baghi mine. From a maximum of 56 wt % Cr in 1907, the ore grade decreased by the end of the 80s to 30-45 wt % Cr2O3 (Table 3). At that time it was enriched to > 50 % by a small concentration unit. The Cr mine was definively closed in 1992; however, Tiebaghi Massif is currently mined for supergene Ni ore by Societe Le Nickel (SLN), a subsidiary corporation of French firm Eramet. the mining in New Caledonia is contributing to the endangerment of the New Caledonian marbled gecko.Global Infomine References Category:Populated places in New Caledonia Category:Mines in New Caledonia ","title":"Tiebaghi"},{"id":"28235201","text":"Houshang Golmakani is an Iranian journalist, film critic and director.

Bungaroosh is often found in buildings of that era in the town and in its near neighbours Worthing and Lewes, but is little known elsewhere. In this respect, it is similar to mathematical tiles - another localised building material introduced in, and characteristic of, that era. It can incorporate any of a wide variety of substances and materials, and is used most often in external walls. The manufacture of bungaroosh involved placing miscellaneous materials, such as whole or broken bricks, cobblestones, flints (commonly found on the South Downs around Brighton), small pebbles, sand and pieces of wood into hydraulic lime and then pouring it between shuttering until it has set. The shuttering (formwork) process typically involved erecting a wooden frame (often made out of railway sleepers after they became readily available in the 19th century), pouring in the lime and adding solid materials to the mixture. Other structural fittings, such as brick piers or wooden lintels, could then be added if more support was needed or other structures were to be added. This was particularly common in Brighton, where bungaroosh walls were often built behind the impressive stuccoed fa√ßades of Regency-style houses. The material is particularly prevalent in the early 19th-century squares, crescents and terraces of Brighton's seafront, such as Regency Square, Royal Crescent and the Kemp Town estate. Another technique was to wait for the mixture to set, then render it with a lime-based mixture and paint it. This produced a consistent, regular surface which could be used to build the symmetrical fa√ßades required in Georgian architecture - a popular style in Lewes. Although the material is solid once set, it has poor resistance to water. If it dries out completely, it can crumble away; but if it gets wet it can dissolve and start to move, causing structural failure. Regular drying-out and saturation caused by the effects of the weather has caused some bay-window fronts to collapse in Brighton. A common maxim states that much of Brighton \\"could be demolished with a well-aimed hose\\"; the supposed extent of this destruction varies between \\"a third\\" and \\"half\\" depending on the source. The etymology of the first part of the word is the same as bungalow; late 17th century: from Hindi ba·πÖglƒÅ ‚Äòbelonging to Bengal‚Äô. Second part is unknown, possibly a colloquialism.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 385. It is north of Brigg and south-west of Barton upon Humber. Saxby All Saints is a conservation area, and one of the five Low Villages ‚Äì Worlaby, Bonby, Saxby All Saints, Horkstow and South Ferriby, between Brigg and the River Humber ‚Äì so-called because of their position below the northern edge of the Lincolnshire Wolds, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. History According to Mills', Saxby probably either derives its name from a \\"farmstead or village of a man called Saksi\\", an Old Scandinavian person name, or from \\"Saksar\\" (Saxons).Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, p. 407, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011). The village appears in the Domesday survey as Saxebi, in the Yarborough Hundred of the North Riding of Lindsey. It comprised 10 households, with 8 villagers, 2 freemen, 3 fisheries, and 7¬Ω ploughlands. The lords in 1066 were Siward and Thorgisl. By 1086 the land had passed to Roger as Lord of the Manor, with Ivo Taillebois as Tenant-in-chief. \\"Documents Online: Saxby All Saints, Lincolnshire\\", Great Domesday Book, Folio: 350v; The National Archives. Retrieved July 2012 In 1885 Kelly's Directory noted Saxby as a \\"small but very pleasant village\\", north-west of Elsham railway station and near the Ancholme navigation. Parish population in 1881 was 337. It describes the parish land as producing chiefly wheat, oats and barley, with \\"good\\" pasture, and being half of \\"fine chalk subsoil and highly fertile\\" and half, at Saxby Carrs, consisting of \\"clay subsoil, of rather black nature\\". The village contained a post office, six farmers, a blacksmith, wheelwright, bricklayer, miller ‚Äì at Saxby Mill ‚Äì and a Co- operative society. Carriers from Worlaby to Barton and Brigg passed through the village daily. Noted was a National School for 90 pupils, with an average attendance of 60, which was supported by the trustees of the late John Hope Barton.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire with the port of Hull 1885, p. 611 By 1905 a joiner, builder, shoemaker and a carrier were further trades in the village, and a reading room, opened in 1882, was noted, with Henry John Hope Barton esq. J.P. of Saxby Hall, son of John Hope Barton, as lord of the manor and landowner. The National School had become a Public Elementary School. A drinking fountain had been erected at the centre of the village in 1897 to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, and in memory of a Frederick Horsley.

The song was noted in Broadwood's English Traditional Carols and Songs, published in 1908, although the first verse was altered to suit perceived public taste.

All Saints' style is late 13th- century and includes north aisle stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe, added in 1876.Nikolaus PevsnerPevsner, Nikolaus; Harris, John; The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire p. 349; Penguin, (1964); revised by Nicholas Antram (1989), Yale University Press. The limestone ashlar church has a Westmorland slate roof, a three-bell tower with crocketed pinnacles, and an embattled parapet. The interior comprises a chancel of three bays and a nave of five bays, with monuments to the Barton family. Kelly's Directory describes the church as \\"a beautiful edifice\\" with an 1871 \\"excellent organ\\" and church plate from the 16th century. A church clock was added to the tower by the parishioners in 1893, to commemorate the coming of age of Henry John Hope Barton, and the 1904 chancel screen was carved in the village. The church register dates from 1719. The living included a rectory and glebe lands, the gift of the Barton family and estate. The Queen Victoria limestone column monument and drinking trough, with its waterspout a carved lion's head, also commemorates Frederick Horsley \\"Having been for 42 years the faithful and respected steward of this Estate\\". The monument is Grade II listed. Saxby Hall is a brick-built, Grade II listed, 18th-century building remodelled in the early 19th century, with its west wing remaining from the earlier structure. It was the home of the Barton family. Further listed landmarks are the mid- to late 18th-century brick-built Saxby Manor, the 1853 yellow-brick Old Rectory, and the 17th-century Lodge Cottage and Ivy House with barn, all on Main Street, and the mid-19th-century Saxby Bridge, on North Carr Lane, which spans the River Ancholme.

Roughly 40 minutes away from Columbia, the state capitol, it is one of the state's largest tourist attractions. The 107-acre site is also known as Historic Camden Revolutionary War Restoration, and as the British Revolutionary War Fortifications. Camden contains preserved structures and grounds that are representative of the Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War. The site is managed by a consortium of private donors and local governments. The area is also an affiliated unit of the National Park Service. History Following the loss of Charleston, Camden was captured and served as the main British supply post from the spring of 1780 to the spring of 1781 during the American Revolutionary War, and served as their garrison for two major engagements, the Battle of Camden and Battle of Hobkirk's Hill. Camden was also strategic in maintaining Britain's control of South Carolina's back country. At the time, Camden consisted of two city blocks of period homes and military barracks surrounded by a palisade log fence, and further protected by five redoubt and three other fortified features (a house, a jail, and a powder magazine) which were placed strategically from 100 to 1000 feet outside the town itself. The desire to control this territory was great for the British, as Camden was located on a crossroads of the routes to the largest Southern cities of Charleston, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia. The location of the principal Battle of Camden is nine miles (14 km) north of the site, while several other skirmishes occurred within of the town. Between the summers of 1780 and 1781, the British were able to claim victory in many of these assaults, but with high casualty rates. These costly struggles both weakened the Redcoats as a unit and spurred the momentum of an anti-war movement in the British Isles. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.Here is a link to the official form requesting to be placed on the National Register. http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/kershaw/S10817728002/S10817728002.pdf Camden is significant due to the role it played during the war. It was a direct result of England's attempt during late 1779 to attempt to gain control of all the southern colonies.http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/kershaw/S10817728002/ Museum Joseph Kershaw Mansion Included within the park are a variety of reconstructed and refurbished structures from the colonial-era town site.

Historic Camden Activities, events and reenactments Each year during the first weekend in November, Camden hosts its most popular event, \\"Revolutionary War Field Days\\". The reenactments held throughout the weekend depict military operations of both British and American forces. They are widely popular, and hundreds of re-enactors gather from more than 20 states every year. The Camden reenactments are some of the oldest Revolutionary War reenactments in the United States. The events are historically accurate and accompanied by live commentary. Throughout the weekend the re-enactors remain in character, and visitors are encouraged to walk through the camps. The guests are greeted with a historically accurate depiction of the 18th-century battleground. They may experience blacksmithing, campfire cooking, and live dance demonstrations. The museum also offers various guided and unguided tours along with a .7-mile nature trail and picnic area. Historic Camden also allows people to volunteer at the site. Camden is mainly funded by charitable donations and small local government funding, so volunteers are key to maintaining it and its facilities.

It was first constituted in 1943 and served in China during World War II. During the Gulf War in 1990, it was the first Army hospital unit established and deployed into Iraq with combat forces of the XVIII Airborne Corps. More recently it has been involved in relief operations following natural disasters and has undertaken several recent deployments to Iraq. Currently the unit falls under the command of the 44th Medical Brigade and is based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. History The \\"Chief Cuddler\\" on display at Fort Sam Houston. Made by Staff Sgt. Adam R. Irby a member of the 28th Combat Support Hospital, to safely rewarm patients in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in Iraq in 2003. The 28th Combat Support Hospital was originally constituted on 25 May 1943. It was activated the following month in the Army of the United States as the 28th Portable Surgical Hospital based at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Following this it was deployed to the China Burma India Theater of World War II for which it was awarded two campaign participation credits: \\"China Defensive\\" and \\"China Offensive\\". For their involvement in the campaign the unit received the special designation of the \\"China Dragons\\". Following the end of hostilities, the unit was deactivated on 20 December 1945 in India. With the expansion of the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War, the decision was made to reactivate the unit in 1967. This occurred on 25 July, however, prior to that occurring, the unit was officially redesignated as the 28th Surgical Hospital on 18 April 1967 and allotted to the Regular Army. Upon reactivation, the 28th were stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and were brought up to operational status, fielding the Medical Unit Self-Contained Transportable (MUST) system, which replaced the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) system that had previously been used. On 21 December 1972, the unit was reorganized and redesignated as the 28th Combat Support Hospital. In 1990, the 28th CSH deployed to Southwest Asia as part of the US contribution to the Gulf War. They were the first Army hospital to be set up during Operation Desert Shield and later during the ground operations phase of the conflict, the 28th CSH crossed into Iraq in support of the XVIII Airborne Corps. Prior to the deployment, the hospital was still equipped with the old MUST equipment as it had not been scheduled to receive the new Deployable Medical System (DEPMEDS) equipment until 1992, however, due to the urgency of the situation they were rapidly re-equipped. The 28th CSH remained in Iraq for a month following the end of the war, during which time it treated a number of Iraqi civilians and prisoners of war. For its involvement in the Gulf War, the 28th CSH received two campaign participation credits: \\"Defense of Saudi Arabia\\" and \\"Liberation and Defense of Kuwait\\". Following this the unit returned to the United States, after which it undertook a number of disaster relief operations. In the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, the unit was deployed to Homestead, Florida in August 1992 to provide assistance. Later, in September 1994, the 28th CSH deployed to Haiti in support of Operation Uphold Democracy.

In 2001, the 28th CSH was deployed to the Balkans before taking part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Hodges 2007, p. 14. Subsequently, they established themselves in an Iraqi hospital in the Green Zone in Baghdad.Gawande 2004, p. 2474.Hodges 2007, p. 94. In 2006, the unit was deployed to Baghdad, undertaking a 15-month tour stationed at Ibn Sina Hospital. In October 2009, the 28th Combat Support Hospital deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom where it operated medical treatment facilities in several different locations around the country providing world class health care to service members, DOD civilians, US contractors, third country nationals, Iraqi civilians, and many others. The 28th CSH continued to serve during Operation New Dawn and redeployed back to Ft. Bragg, North Carolina in October 2010 after 12 months of meritorious service. In 2013‚Äì2014, 28 CSH deployed to Bagram, Afghanistan. Throughout the 12-month tour, they earned the nickname \\"Sky Medics\\". In May 2016, a task force medical team from the 28th Combat Support Hospital deployed to Iraq. They were designated as Task Force Medical 28. TFMED28 is the first Role III CSH to come back into theater after the troop draw down to support Operation Inherent Resolve. They had built a Role III tent hospital to support all medical aspects of Iraq and Syria. The team redeployed in February 2017 and was replaced by a task force medical team from 21st Combat Support Hospital. In October 2018, the 28 CSH hosted the FY 19 Fall XVIII Airborne Corps Expert Field Medical Badge (EFMB) on behalf of the 44 Medical Brigade on Fort Bragg. The Expert Field Medical Badge may be awarded to all officers assigned or detailed to an Army Medical Department (AMEDD) Corps; Army officers in training at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences; Army officers enrolled in the Health Professions Scholarship Program; warrant officers who have an AMEDD primary military occupational specialty (MOS) controlled by the Surgeon General; warrant officer pilots that have a special qualification identifier \\"D\\" (Aeromedical Evacuation Pilot) and are assigned to an air ambulance unit; and enlisted personnel who have an MOS in the 68- Career Management Field (CMF) as well as an AMEDD primary MOS, MOS18D, or 38BW4. Despite the FY18 EFMB statistics only allowing for a 13% pass rate, the first testing of FY19 produced 77 badge holders of the 255 candidates that were in-processed; resulting in a 30% pass rate. In March 2019, the 28 CSH undertook a field Training Exercise (FTX) that incorporated nine internal units and 12 external units and organizations. As a result, the Emergency Medical Treatment (EMT) section incorporated Medical Hands-Free Unified Broadcast (MEDHUB) Operational Test and Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC); the Patient Administration Director (PAD) Section incorporated US Transportation Command Regulating Command and Control Evacuation System (TRAC2ES) via the 43rd Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron Aeromedical Evacuation Liaison Team (AELT) and Joint Patient Assessment Tracking System (JPATS); 690 Medical Company Ground Ambulance provided in- route care to multiple casualties from the Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC) MASCAL exercise from Point of Injury (POI) through all roles of care; incorporated Medical Hands-Free Unified Broadcast (MEDHUB) Operational Test. CLINOPS incorporated MTOE Assigned Personnel (MAPs) integration into the CSH, validated the FBNC Pre-hospitalization plan; executed the Capability Development Integration Directorate (CDID) proof of concept: 4-bed (FST w/ ICU) and further build to 10-bed w/ EMT+ PLX, eventually complexing a 44- bed hospital in under 72 hours, and conducted the second ever cadaver lab in the CSH footprint; which trained over 60 medical procedures needed to meet ICTLs. The Operations and Clinical Operations section planned and executed the first ever combined student liberation/ repatriation exercise with C/1-1 SWTG (A) SERE-C and C/3-82d GSAB Aeromedical evacuation (AE) assets; resulting in SERE students traveling from Role 1 to Role 3 medical care. The CSH S6 tested and validated the Tampa Microwave Local Area Network system with 50 Expeditionary Signal Battalion ‚Äì Enhanced (ESB-E); provided feedback towards efforts to improve the Army's prototype (ESB-E) for future Signal operations. In April 2020, the 28 CSH is due to transform into the 16 Hospital Center and 528 Field hospital in order to meet the demands of multi-domain battle and provide expeditionary Health Service Support and hospitalization. The mission will be: Deploys to provide mission command for up to two functioning Field Hospitals (32 BED). The subordinate Garrison Field Hospital will be the 528 Field Hospital. Their mission is to deploy to provide hospitalization (32 BED) and outpatient services to all classes of patients in a theater of operations. Under the 528 FH, there will be the 437 MED DET (SURG) with the mission: Deploys to augment the capabilities of the Field Hospital (32 BED) with thoracic, urology, oral maxillofacial surgical capabilities, 24 additional ICU beds, outpatient services, and microbiology. The 430 MED DET and the 131 MED DET will have the mission: deploy to augment the Field Hospital (32 BED) with operational dental care, and provision of one additional ICU ward, one ICW ward, additional microbiology capabilities and outpatient services for all classes of patients within a theater of operations. Role and structure The 28th Combat Support Hospital is currently attached to the 44th Medical Brigade and is based at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Equipped with DEPMEDS equipment, it is tasked with providing Level III combat health support when deployed.Level III combat health support is defined as resuscitation, initial wound surgery and post operative treatment. Joint Doctrine for Civil-Military Operations, Annex A to Appendix C, pp. 1‚Äì2. The DEPMEDS system consists of \\"canvas tents that are connected to hard-sided boxes\\" which, when fully established, requires an area of ,Hodges 2007, p. 13. and provides a suite of medical facilities and support equipment that allows the unit to perform a large number of functions similar to that of more permanent facilities including pharmacology, radiology and surgery. It has a 296-bed capacity, although only 96 of these are able to be used for patients requiring intensive care. At the same time it maintains the ability to detach sub-units to task force level operations to provide front-line medical and surgical support. When the hospital is not deployed, or has not been assigned a patient care role, it is tasked with supporting the XVIII Airborne Corps, and undertaking a range of tasks as part of the Fort Bragg garrison. The hospital has an authorized strength of between 500 and 600 personnel, of whom about 30 are physicians. However, when not deployed it consists only of a small cadre staff who undertake various administrative tasks to keep the unit operational, while the majority of its medical personnel are stationed elsewhere at permanent facilities where they can use their training on a daily basis. When the unit is warned out for deployment, however, these personnel are recalled to the unit. During these periods, the hospital is commanded by a Medical Service Corps officer who is responsible for maintaining the unit administratively, however, upon assuming a patient care role, a Medical Corps officer, who is a qualified physician, takes over command of the unit. The unit possesses its own command, management and administrative support elements and consists of the following sub-units: *Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment (HHD) *A Company *B Company *759th Forward Surgical Team (Airborne) *240th Forward Surgical Team *274th Forward Surgical Team (Airborne) *541st Forward Resuscitative Surgical Team (Airborne) *432nd Blood Detachment *528th Combat Operations Stress Control *690th Medical Company Ground Ambulance *207th Med Team Head & Neck.

The force was based on the 4th Indian Division and commanded by Maj Gen T.W. Rees. The force was unable to execute its task successfully and it was disbanded so that the newly formed dominion armies of India and Pakistan could take charge of the situation. Composition The Force had approximately 15 Indian and 10 Pakistani battalions, and comprised 5th Indian Infantry Brigade, 11th Indian Infantry Brigade of the division and three additional brigades, namely the 14 Parachute Brigade (which became part of the Pakistan Army), 43rd Indian Infantry Brigade (Lorried) (ex 1 Armoured Division), and 114th Indian Infantry Brigade.Ravi Rikhye and Mandeep Bajwa, 4th Infantry Division: An Outline History , V3.0, March 25, 2008, www.orbat.com (Centre for Indian Military History), accessed August 1, 2010 The 50th Parachute Brigade and 77th Parachute Brigade (both formerly with 2nd Airborne Division), as well as the 123rd Indian Infantry Brigade, were attached to the Force. Formation and disbandment The Boundary Force was established on July 17, 1947, with its headquarters at Lahore. It became operational on August 1, 1947, but was disbanded on September 1 because of its ineffectiveness in controlling the riots breaking out in consequence of Partition. Maj Gen Rees was provided Brig D.S. Brar and Brig M. Ayub Khan (who later became field marshal and President of Pakistan) from India and Pakistan respectively as \\"Military Advisors\\". He was later provided Brig K.S. Thimayya (India) and Brig Nazir Ahmed (Pakistan) as \\"Alternate Military Advisors\\". However, Gen Rees refused to heed advice from his advisors, which led to his being criticised; he rebuked Thimayya that he was not going to take advice from him being ten years his senior. In addition, Rees was criticised by politicians from both sides. In the 25 August meeting of the Joint Defence Council at Lahore, Gen Rees stated that the Boundary Force was fatigued and their mood explosive. The British officers, he said, had done their best and the situation was beyond salvation. He further recommended that the two dominions now take responsibility for the security of refugees on their respective sides of the border. After Rees handed over, Major General K. S. Thimayya reportedly took over command of the Boundary Force.

Map of Granada, 1795. Luis del Marmol Carvajal (Granada, Spain, 1520 - Velez Malaga, Spain, 1600) was a Spanish chronicler living many years among the formerly Moorish Granada kingdom morisco's inhabitants and in the North African Berber regions at the end of the 15th, and a good part of the 16th century. He was proficient in Hassaniya Arabic, Berber Tamazight and/or the Algerian Berber Taqbaylit language. He was the illegitimate son of a High Justice Officer, Pedro del Marmol, who recognized him as his natural son in 1528. Whether his mother was some sort of slave or personal servant of this High Court Office lawyer, his father, \\"given\\" or \\"bought\\" after the conquest of Granada, 1492, cannot be confirmed. It is well known that after the dissolution of the Caliph of C√≥rdoba in the 11th century, many of the rulers and people from the kingdom of Granada maintained that their identities were essentially Zenata Berber. This may explain their settlements and affinity with the Merinid and after the Wattasids dynasty, (Ÿàÿ∑ÿßÿ≥ŸäŸàŸÜ wa·π≠ƒÅsƒ´y≈´n), ruling Fez, until, after 1554, the Saadi¬¥s rulers, (Arabic: ÿ≥ÿπÿØŸäŸàŸÜ), from Tagmadert, at the Draa river valley, near Tidzi, near Zagora, conquered the town. It is said that for eight years Luis del Marmol was imprisoned in Algiers, and that he returned to Spain in his mid-thirties after fighting in Italy, Spain and the North African litoral from the Atlantic shores. He spent time moving and visiting places, including Libyan Berber areas. Dates for these adventures are given just around 1554, curiously enough after the conquest of Fez.

Along with Friedrich Franek, he was one of only two recipients of both the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa, the highest military honour of Austria-Hungary. Career As a young officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, Windisch served in World War I. Among other decorations, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa (11 December 1925). A first lieutenant in 1918, he remained in the Army of the newly founded Austrian Republic. Promoted to captain in 1921 (1 January 1921), he was selected for General Staff Training and graduated on top of his class. A full colonel in the Austrian General Staff since 1936 (promotion 24 June 1936) and senior tactics teacher, Windisch was well known for his refusal of the Nazi movement. After the Nazi take over in Austria (13 March 1938), he was considered \\"politically unreliable\\", expelled from the General Staff Corps, put on administrative leave and earmarked for forced retirement. The beginning of World War II (1 September 1939) and the resulting need for experienced military leaders led to his assignment as commanding officer of a Mountain Infantry Regiment (Gebirgsj√§ger-Regiment 139). After the fall of Poland, he and his regiment took part in Operation Weser√ºbung, the invasion of Norway. Following the campaign, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Alois Windisch surrendered to the Soviet troops in 1945 and was extradited to Yugoslavia. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment but was released in 1953.

In addition, he was chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Working Group on Intellectual Property for six years, and of the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation forum's Intellectual Property Experts' Group from 2005 to 2007.. He was a member of the Singapore delegation which negotiated the United States ‚Äì Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed on 6 May 2003, and led negotiations for the FTA's Intellectual Property and Dispute Settlement Chapters. He also led talks relating to numerous investment agreements on Singapore's behalf, including those with Iran, Oman, Russia and Saudi Arabia; and assisted with the drafting of various ASEAN legal instruments, including the Framework Agreement on Enhancing ASEAN Economic Cooperation, the Agreement on the Common Effective Preferential Tariff Scheme for the ASEAN Free Trade Area, the ASEAN Protocol on Enhanced Dispute Settlement Mechanism, and the ASEAN Framework Agreement for the Integration of the Priority Sectors. The International Court of Justice in session in the Grand Hall of Justice of the Peace Palace in The Hague on 10 December 2009 Tiwari was one of the first legal officers who specialized in public international law when the International Affairs Division of the Attorney- General's Chambers was established. He was part of the Singapore team to the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and helped to frame important provisions in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),See, for instance, . which Singapore acceded to on 17 November 1994.. He also headed negotiations which culminated in the signing of a pact in 1994 delineating a new boundary between Malaysia and Singapore in the Straits of Johor.; . Tiwari was on Singapore's legal team in a case brought by Malaysia to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for provisional measures against alleged damage to its territorial waters due to land reclamation by Singapore in Tuas. On 8 October 2003, the Tribunal declined to prescribe provisional measures, stating that Malaysia had not shown that there was a situation of urgency or any risk that its rights to its territorial sea would suffer irreversible damage pending consideration of the merits of the case.; see also . Having been involved in the territorial dispute between Singapore and Malaysia over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge for almost 30 years, including leading bilateral negotiations to attempt a settlement and later to conclude the special agreement submitting the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), he was part of the team that presented Singapore's case before the ICJ in 2007. The following year, the Court ruled that Singapore had sovereignty over Pedra Branca. Tiwari was also legal adviser to the delegation which negotiated the agreement establishing diplomatic relations between Singapore and the People's Republic of China, and was a member of the Hindu Endowments Board (from 2 May 1983),. the Hindu Advisory Board which advises the Government and the Hindu Endowments Board on matters relating to the Hindu religion and custom,; . and the board of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore.. Later life Despite retiring from the Legal Service in December 2007, Tiwari was re-employed by the Attorney-General's Chambers as a special consultant until December 2008. On 13 December 2007, he was appointed by the World Trade Organization as a panellist for the first international adjudication of enforcement provisions in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights in a dispute between China and the United States.. Following his stint as a consultant, he became a senior visiting fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. He was appointed to the board of governors of the IP Academy, an organization providing training and conducting research in intellectual property matters, on 1 February 2009.. He was also Secretary of the Kreta Ayer People's Foundation and patron of the Siglap South Management Committee. Tiwari was the founding president of the Hindi Society (Singapore) and continued to serve as principal of the Hindi Centres managed by the Society in his retirement years.; In 1989 he had been elected to chair a pro tempore committee to look into the study of Hindi, and met the Minister for Education Dr. Tony Tan Keng Yam to request that Hindi be allowed to be learned as a second language by students. On 6 October 1989, the Minister announced that Hindi ‚Äì along with Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi and Urdu ‚Äì would be offered as a second language in secondary schools up to the O-level standard. While the Ministry would provide premises for the lessons, students had to make their own arrangements for teachers. The pro tem committee arranged for the first Hindi classes for secondary school students on 21 January 1990 and, after registering as the Hindi Society (Singapore) on 4 August 1990, began primary school classes the next day.. Tiwari was also Vice-President of the Board for the Teaching and Testing of South Asian Languages.. On 25 July 2010, Tiwari had a severe headache and was taken to hospital and operated upon. However, while sedated, he suffered a fatal aneurysm and cerebral haemorrhage, and died shortly before noon on 26 July 2010 aged 64 years. He was cremated that evening.

The Black Sea undersea river is a current of particularly saline water flowing through the Bosphorus Strait and along the seabed of the Black Sea. The discovery of the river, announced on 1 August 2010, was made by scientists at the University of Leeds, and is the first of its kind in the world. The undersea river stems from salty water spilling through the Bosphorus Strait from the Mediterranean Sea into the Black Sea, where the water has a lower salt content. Scientists have previously discovered channels running along ocean floors, based on sonar scanning. One of the largest of these runs from the mouth of the Amazon River into the Atlantic Ocean. Though it was suspected that these channels might function as rivers, it was only with the discovery of the Black Sea river that this suspicion was confirmed. Because of the power and unpredictability of these streams, they have been difficult to explore directly. A team of scientists headed by Jeff Peakall and Daniel Parsons of the University of Leeds collaborated with scientists from the University of Southampton, Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the Turkish Institute of Marine Sciences. The team used the Natural Environment Research Council's Autosub3 ‚Äì a 7-metre torpedo-shaped autonomous underwater vehicle ‚Äì to get as close to the current as possible. The river was found to be long, up to deep and wide. Though smaller than the Amazon channel, the undersea river still carried ten times more water than the Rhine. It flows at a speed of , with passing through per second. Had it been a surface river it would have ranked as the sixth largest river in the world. The river was found to contain features typical of surface rivers, such as river banks, floodplains, waterfalls and rapids. One major difference was that the underwater river, when rounding a bend, moved in currents spinning in the opposite direction from those on land. The river works as a density current, because it carries sediments along the sea floor and has a higher salinity than the surrounding water. The discovery was expected to have great implication for the study of marine biology, climate change, and geological formation. In addition to this, the information obtained could be useful for oil companies interested in exploiting underwater resources of oil and natural gas.

He survived to see the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, but was not actively employed during them. Robert Roddam was born to a gentry family in northern England, and entered the navy some years before the outbreak of the War of Jenkins' Ear. He worked his way up through the ranks during this war, and the wider War of the Austrian Succession, distinguishing himself in several actions and gaining promotions which eventually led to his first command in 1746. He impressed his superior officers, including George Anson and Sir Peter Warren, with his ability and enthusiasm, particularly during a daring attack on a French force at Cedeira . Appointed to larger and more powerful ships, Roddam continued to win praise, and spent some time in North American waters, where he became embroiled in local power struggles. Sent to the Caribbean shortly after the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, Roddam encountered a powerful French squadron, and after a hard-fought struggle, was captured and taken prisoner. Released after a period of time spent imprisoned in poor conditions, Roddam was tried by court martial and honourably acquitted. He spent some time with the Channel Fleet watching the French coast, and was briefly employed as senior officer of one of the blockading squadrons, where he again showed his willingness to fight against heavy odds. He was employed briefly escorting convoys before the end of the war, after which he went ashore. Returning to active service during the Falklands Crisis in 1770, he commanded ships until 1773, and was again recalled to active service, this time with the outbreak of the American War of Independence. He was promoted to flag rank not long afterwards, and became commander-in-chief at the Nore. His final period of active service came during the Spanish armament of 1790, when he was commander-in-chief at Portsmouth, and readied ships for the anticipated war with Spain. He continued to be promoted, reaching the rank of admiral of the red in 1805. He inherited the family seat at Roddam Hall, but though he married three times, he died without issue in 1808. Family and early life Robert Roddam was born in 1719 at the family seat of Roddam Hall, in Northumberland. He was the second of three sons born to Edward Roddam, and his wife Jane. Roddam entered the navy in 1735, joining the 20-gun as a midshipman under Captain Drummond, with whom he served in the West Indies for the next five years. He then transferred in succession to the 80-gun ships , and . During this time he served with Sir Chaloner Ogle and Sir Edward Vernon at the Battle of Cartagena de Indias, and the occupation of Cumberland Bay in 1741. He distinguished himself during these encounters, and narrowly escaped being killed, when a cannonball shot off part of his coat. He was promoted to third lieutenant of the 60-gun on 2 November 1741, and served under her commander, Captain William Hervey. Roddam was present when Superb encountered a Spanish ship off the Irish coast during her voyage back to Britain. The Spanish ship, measuring 400 tons, was armed with 20 guns and manned by a crew of 60, was captured, and later valued at ¬£200,000. =Hervey's court martial= Hervey had gained a reputation for ill treatment of his officers, and on Superbs return to Plymouth in August 1742, Hervey was tried by court martial on charges of 'cruelty, ill usage of his officers, and neglect of duty'. In response, Hervey made accusations against his first lieutenant, John Hardy, who was also brought to court martial. Roddam gave evidence to support the charges against Hervey, who was found guilty and cashiered, while Hardy was honourably acquitted. =Monmouth and 'witchcraft'= With Superb paid off at Plymouth, Roddam was appointed third lieutenant of the 64-gun on 7 September 1742, serving under Captain Charles Wyndham. He was with Monmouth for the next four years, spent cruising off the French coast, and travelling as far south as the Canary Islands. While off Tenerife at midnight one day, Roddam, as master of the watch, was ordered to put the ship about. Three times he attempted it, but each time it proved impossible to do so, though there was no apparent obstacle to the manoeuvre. When relieved by Lieutenant Hamilton, Roddam related the strange behaviour of the ship, suggesting that some sort of witchcraft was responsible. In Hamilton's presence Roddam attempted to repeat the procedure, and for the fourth time the ship missed stays. At daybreak a strange sail was sighted ahead of Monmouth, which was chased down and captured. She proved to be a Spanish ship, valued at ¬£100,000, which would otherwise have been missed had Monmouth come about during the night. Roddam was advanced to second lieutenant on 14 July 1744, during the captaincy of Henry Harrison, and two years later, on 7 June 1746, was promoted to his first command, that of the 14-gun sloop , which was nearing completion at Poole. First commands Viper was launched at Poole on 11 June, and having got her ready for sea, Roddam sailed to join the Channel Fleet at Spithead, arriving on 26 July. Shortly after his arrival, the commander-in-chief, George Anson expressed a desire to stop a fleet, then at Plymouth, from sailing. The commanders of the various ships in the fleet argued against sending a ship, owing to the strong south-westerly wind, but Roddam, despite having a brand-new ship, not fully fitted and trialled at sea, offered to make the attempt. Impressed, Anson wrote to the Admiralty, and requested that Roddam be placed under his command. Anson was later superseded by Vice-Admiral Sir Peter Warren, who in mid-1747 received word from a Bristol-based privateer that a fleet of some 30 ships were assembled at Cedeiro Bay, near Cape Ortegal, loaded with naval stores. The entrance to the anchorage was very narrow, and was defended by two shore batteries. With the odds against any attack, Sir Peter decided that there was little point in risking an assault. At this time Captain Henry Harrison, Roddam's old commander on Monmouth, suggested to Warren that Roddam make an attempt in Viper, adding that 'He would answer for that young man effecting all that human nature could perform'. Impressed with Harrison's confidence, Warren ordered Roddam to make an attack. Roddam sailed that evening, and was in position the following morning. He stormed the first battery, carrying it and destroying all its guns, as well as capturing a Spanish privateer which emerged from the bay. He then entered the bay, burnt twenty-eight merchant ships and captured five of them, the most he could provide sailors to man from his small crew. The inhabitants of the town of Cedeira offered to surrender to Roddam on his terms, but were told that Roddam 'did not come there to aggrandize himself or crew by distressing harmless individuals, but only such as armed against Great Britain...' On his return to England Roddam was embraced by Warren, who thanked him personally for his skill and gallantry. Warren wrote to the Admiralty strongly recommending Roddam for promotion, and as a result of his efforts, Roddam was advanced to post captain on 9 July 1747, and given command of the 24-gun . Meanwhile, Roddam had, on his return to Britain after his action off Cedeira, been petitioned by the constituents of Portsmouth to represent them as their Member of Parliament. Roddam turned down their offer, and went on to serve at sea under Commodore Mitchell, cruising off the Dutch coast and in the North Sea. During this time he escorted Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, who was on a diplomatic mission to the Dutch Republic. Roddam's time in the North Sea came to an end with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, which brought the War of the Austrian Succession to a close. He retained command of Greyhound and went out to North America to serve under Admiral Charles Watson at Louisbourg, who based Roddam at New York for the next three years until 1751. While at New York in 1750, one of Greyhounds lieutenants accidentally shot a woman. A civil trial and court martial resulted, causing Roddam considerable trouble, and hinting at an anti-English mood among some sections of colonial society. Roddam was appointed to command the 50-gun , which was then the Plymouth guardship, on 30 January 1753. He was moved to the 50-gun in 1755. Seven Years' War =Defending Greenwich= Joseph de Bauffremont, whose squadron captured Roddam's ship off San Domingo Roddam was ordered to the Caribbean shortly after the outbreak of the Seven Years' War and departed for Jamaica on 23 January 1757. While cruising off Cape Cabron, San Domingo on 18 March 1757, mysterious sails were sighted, which were at first assumed to be a small fleet of merchant ships being conveyed by two frigates. They were in fact a squadron of French warships under Joseph de Bauffremont, consisting of the 84-gun Tonnant, the 74-gun ships Diad√®me and Desauncene, the 64-gun ships √âveill√© and Inflexible, the frigates Sauvage and Brune, and a 20-gun storeship. The French were to windward, and Bauffremont, unsure of Greenwichs identity, sent one of his frigates to examine her. Realising that with the wind in the Frenchman's favour, he could not escape, Roddam attempted to lure the frigate towards him, hoping to capture her before the rest of the fleet could intervene, and then send her immediately to Rear-Admiral George Townshend, the commander at Jamaica, with news of the French movements. On assessing Greenwichs strength, the frigate kept close to the squadron, which then came up and attacked, action commencing at 9 a.m. when Diad√®me opened fire. For the next twelve hours Greenwich was constantly engaged with one or other of the French ships. Roddam still hoped to carry his plan of capturing one of them into execution, and assembled his men in an attempt to board the 64-gun √âveill√©, but several of her consorts bore up and opened fire, damaging Greenwichs rigging and leaving her unmanageable. Roddam gathered his officers together, and told them that though they had no hope of winning against such a superior force, if any man could point out the admiral's flagship, he hoped to engage her and fight on for another hour or two. His officers, among whom was Lieutenant James Wallace, pledged to follow their captain, but pointed out that they had done all in their power to defend their ship. At 9.30 p.m., Roddam agreed to surrender his ship, as further resistance would only cause further casualties among his men. The colours were then struck to √âveill√©, upon which her commander demanded Roddam come aboard his ship. Roddam refused, answering that if he was wanted on the French ship, a boat must be sent for him, or else he would rehoist the colours and defend the ship until she sank. A lieutenant was then sent over in a boat from the French ship, and Roddam came aboard. The French commander, Captain Merville, gave Roddam the bedding of the ordinary ship's company and a dirty rug, and did not allow him to change his clothes. Greenwich was ransacked, and the crew left unfed. Roddam protested, and demanded to be taken to see Bauffremont. After Roddam had expressed his grievances, Bauffremont asked Roddam why he had refused to come to present his surrender in his own boat. Roddam replied that he would have considered it a disgrace, and that his sword would have been delivered through the body of the person demanding it, had it happened to him. =Captivity= Roddam and his men were taken to Hispaniola and imprisoned there. At first Roddam was allowed to visit his men everyday, but after some time, this was refused. His men became concerned that he had been murdered, and on not getting a satisfactory answer to their queries, seized their guards and took up arms. The prison governor sent for Roddam and asked him to restore order among his men, which Roddam only agreed to do once he had received promises of better treatment for them. Their treatment improved, and after two months in prison the men were paroled back to Jamaica. =Court martial= On arriving back at Jamaica Roddam was tried by court martial for the loss of his ship. The court martial was held aboard on 14 July 1757. After hearing evidence from the crew, the court honourably acquitted him, and Roddam had the minutes printed at Kingston for circulation. He had hoped for similar success to the minutes printed from Admiral Sir John Byng's court martial, which had been held earlier that year, but found they did not sell as well as he had expected. He was told by the printer that ‚Äòif you had been condemned to be shot, your trial would have sold as well; but the public take no interest in an honourable acquittal‚Äô. Return to service Roddam returned to England aboard a packet, and had to work to save the ship when the master pressed on too much sail in a gale, and again when a mysterious sail appeared to be attempting to catch the packet. Roddam was exchanged shortly after his arrival in England, and went out as a passenger aboard to join the fleet off Ushant under Sir Edward Hawke. Hawke gave him command of the 50-gun on 7 December 1759. After taking her to Plymouth to fit her out, he was sent by Hawke to cruise off Brest, watching the French fleet there in company with , under Captain Augustus Hervey, and HMS Montagu under Captain Joshua Rowley. Three French warships came out, which the British ships chased back under the guns of the shore batteries, and ran one of them ashore. =Off Belle √éle= Having carried this out, Roddam was sent to relieve Robert Duff, who was cruising off Belle √éle. To do so he sailed Colchester through Le Ras, a narrow channel separating the Saints from the mainland, and entered Audierne Bay, and became the first known English ship to do so. On arriving he received orders to watch a fleet of transport ships, with an escort of 16 frigates, moored there, believed to be preparing to carry troops to invade Ireland. Lacking sufficient ships to engage the frigates, Roddam gave orders that if possible the French were to be engaged so as to target the transport ships and shoot away their masts, but to avoid the frigates. When questioned by his subordinates that ordering his ships not to engage would leave them open to accusations of cowardice, Roddam replied that since he gave the order, only he could be accused, and he would take Colchester and engage all the frigates single- handedly, trusting that 'some of them would be sent to the bottom.' John Reynolds, who succeeded Roddam as senior officer off Belle √éle Before long Commodore John Reynolds arrived aboard and superseded Roddam as senior officer. Reynolds assessed the possibility of attacking the convoy lying in the river, but was advised by his captains that it could not be done. Roddam requested permission to try anyway, as Colchester was 'an old man of war, not worth much, and the loss of her would be trifling for the good of the service.' Reynolds forbade Roddam from trying, whereupon Roddam suggested that Reynolds cruise off one of the channels of Belle √éle, while Roddam covered the other. Reynolds agreed to this, but that night the French were able to elude Reynolds, and escaped into the river Vans. On Duff's return aboard to resume command of the squadron, and finding Colchester in need of repairs, Roddam was sent back to Plymouth, to refit and re-provision. =Convoy work= Roddam returned to Plymouth, with Colchester leaking badly, but the port admiral, Commodore Hanaway, merely sent some caulkers on board, and sent her back to sea to join Sir Edward Hawke off Vans with a convoy. On joining the fleet, Hawke asked who had sent him a ship in such poor condition, and sent Roddam back to Plymouth to properly refit. Roddam was then sent to Saint Helena, with Captain Jeekill's 60-gun under his orders, to bring home the East Indies convoy. They were joined for their return voyage by Sir George Pocock's squadron. As the squadron and the convoy passed the Isles of Scilly, Roddam became concerned that they were too close to the land, and gave the signal to tack. Roddam had a second occasion to warn the convoy, when off Dover. Pocock gave the order to lie-to, but Roddam, seeing that some of the convoy were in danger of running onto South Foreland, signalled for the ships to bear away to the Downs. In both instances Pocock deferred to Roddam's judgement, and thanked him for his efforts. Colchester was then ordered to Portsmouth, and on peace being declared, went ashore. Falklands crisis and American War of Independence Roddam was recalled to active service during the Falklands Crisis in 1770, with an appointment to command the 74-gun on 7 December. The crisis died down without breaking into open conflict, and Roddam remained in command of Lenox, which was used as the Portsmouth guardship, until 19 December 1773, when he was relieved by Captain Matthew Moor. With the outbreak of the American War of Independence Roddam again returned to active service, taking command of the 74-gun at Chatham on 17 March 1777, and took her to Spithead. Here he was to command her as one of 12 ships sent to the Mediterranean, but he received his promotion to rear-admiral of the white on 23 January 1778 and was succeeded as captain of Cornwall by Captain Timothy Edwards. Roddam then became Commander-in-Chief, The Nore in 1778. He held the command for the remainder of the war, being promoted to vice-admiral of the blue on 19 March 1779 and vice-admiral of the white on 26 September 1780. He was without active employment for a time after the end of the war, but was promoted to vice-admiral of the red on 24 September 1787, and on 20 April 1789 he became Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth. Later years He was commander there for three years, flying his flag aboard the 84-gun HMS Royal William during the Spanish armament in 1790. During the crisis he received orders from the Admiralty to prepare the guardships for sea. He had them fitted and ready for manning within five days, and on being ordered to fit a further five ships for sea, completed the task in fourteen days. His rapid response attracted French attention, who reported in their newspapers that 'British ships of war [have] sprung up complete like mushrooms.' With the passing of the crisis Roddam struck his flag in 1792. With the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars Roddam received a promotion to admiral of the blue on 1 February 1793. He was promoted to admiral of the white on 12 April 1794, and admiral of the red on 9 November 1805. Family and personal life Roddam married three times in his life. His first marriage was to Lucy Mary Clinton, the daughter of George Clinton, the governor of New York at the time of Roddam's posting there, on 24 April 1749. Lucy died on 9 December 1750. He then married Alithea Calder, the daughter of Sir James Calder, 3rd Baronet, and a sister of Robert Calder, who would become an admiral in the wars with France, in March 1775. Alithea died on 21 July 1799, with Roddam marrying a third time, this time to a Miss Harrison, though no details are known. None of Roddam's marriages produced any children, and he left his estates to his distant relative William Spencer Stanhope, of Cannon Hall near Barnsley in south Yorkshire, the great-grandson of his first cousin Mary Roddam, wife of Edward Collingwood, and cousin to Admiral Lord Collingwood. Robert Roddam had succeeded to the family estates in 1776, on the death without issue of his elder brother Edward Roddam, and settled at the family seat of Roddam Hall in Northumberland where he had been born. He appears to have spent his time improving the house and grounds, and was probably responsible for adding the late eighteenth-century wings to the hall. He also planted an avenue of trees, which are still extant today, named on Ordnance Survey maps as Admiral's Avenue, which leads to Boat Wood. Admiral Robert Roddam died at Morpeth on 31 March 1808. His biographer, P. K. Crimmin, described him as a 'brave and competent sailor and a diligent administrator', but noted that he was 'not interested in politics or in a political route to professional advancement.' Certain incidents during his career hinted to Crimmin of a 'certain na√Øvety towards the non-naval world', and he noted that Roddam's 'closest connections and friendships were service ones.' Roddam was buried in the Roddam Mausoleum in the churchyard of St Michael's, Ilderton, in north Northumberland. Notes a. Hervey's actions in the Caribbean had, as early as October 1740, led the port admiral to recommend that he be relieved of command, but the Admiralty declined to act. b. The controversy eventually involved a number of colonial leaders, including Chief Justice James DeLancey, Governor George Clinton, who was also Roddam's father-in-law, and John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, the Secretary of State for the Southern Department. Part of the debate revolved around the rights of the civil authorities to intervene in the military's judicial process, with Clinton criticising DeLancey's attempts to extend his authority at the expense of military discipline. c. Greenwich enjoyed only a brief career with the French. She was taken into their service under Captain Foucault, and saw action with Guy Fran√ßois de Coetnempren, comte de Kersaint's squadron at the indecisive Battle of Cap-Fran√ßais on 21 October 1757. She survived the action and escorted a convoy to France, but was wrecked in a gale as she neared the French coast on 1 January 1758.

Ray researches the influence of viral evolution on viral pathogenesis, concentrating in particular on complex RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Stuart Ray's CV, JHU ICM website He has published approximately 100 scientific articles on HIV, HCV, or both. Education and training As an undergraduate, Ray studied at the California Institute of Technology and graduated from Vanderbilt University with a B.S. cum laude in molecular biology. He remained at Vanderbilt for medical school and received his M.D. in 1990. Ray completed a medical residency and both research and clinical fellowships in infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. In 1995, he became the assistant chief of service for the Department of Medicine at Johns Hopkins. Ray was appointed to an assistant professorship in 1997 and was promoted to associate professor in 2003. HIV research Ray has studied the ability of HIV to undergo high levels of mutation in its genomic sequence, exploring the health consequences of this mutability.\\"HIV's Success Might Lie in Its Mutations,\\" United Press International, November 5, 2002. In 1999, Ray and colleagues reported on the sequence diversity of HIV in India. They cautioned that different subtypes could combine, thwarting traditional efforts to develop vaccines.\\"Sequencing of HIV from India Waves a Red Flag for Vaccine Developers,\\" Gene Therapy Weekly, January 25, 1999. In 2005, along with colleagues including Robert F. Siliciano, Ray examined the phenomenon of viral \\"blips.\\" HIV-positive patients who have suppressed HIV replication with the help of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) occasionally exhibit apparent transient increases in the amount of virus in their blood, leading some scientists to express concern that these blips could allow the virus to develop drug resistance. The results of the 2005 study indicated that the virus was unable to gain resistance mutations during the blips, and that many of the blips could be attributed to statistical artifact.\\"Small increases or 'blips' in HIV levels do not signal mutations leading to drug-resistant HIV\\" Ray has also participated in the study of \\"elite suppressors,\\" rare individuals who control HIV replication naturally and do not progress to AIDS quickly, even in the absence of treatment. With Joel Blankson and others, Ray contributed to a study of a monogamous husband-wife couple who were infected with the same strain of HIV but had very different responses to the virus. This work was published in 2008.\\"Rare Case Explains Why Some Infected with HIV Remain Symptom Free without Antiretroviral Drugs\\" Newswise, August 12, 2008. HCV research As HCV evades the immune system, Ray found, its genome not only mutates to escape the body's defenses, but also reverts to its previous, \\"ancestral\\" state when possible. This balance helps the virus to retain fitness.\\"Johns Hopkins Team Finds 'Ancestral' Hepatitis-C Virus at Root of Evolution in Acute and Chronic Infections. AScribe, June 9, 2005. Ray's work on HCV has characterized sources of selective pressure on the HCV genome and identified factors leading to HCV immune escape.

Interpretations Bosch, in his book Sriwijaya, de Sailendrawamsa en de Sanjayawamsa (1952), suggests that in the Medang Kingdom there were two dynasties, the Sanjaya dynasty and the Sailendra dynasty that equally ruled the kingdom. The Sanjaya lineage was established by Sri Sanjaya, the founder of Medang Kingdom whom adheres Shivaist Hinduism. The next Maharaja was Panangkaran, that according to him, defeated by the Sailendras. So in Medang there is two dynasty the Sanjayas ruled northern parts of Java, while Sailendras ruled in southern Java. The daughter of Sailendra Maharaja Samaratungga named Pramodhawardhani married Rakai Pikatan of Sanjaya, that succeeded his father inlaw's throne. As the result the Sanjaya return to power in Medang.

Biography Henry Maksoud, who was of Syrian-Lebanese descent, was married to Ilde Maksoud until 1993. Later, he married Georgina Celia Bizerra Maksoud, with whom he stayed until his death at the age of 85. A year before, due to health issues, he handed off the presidency of the Maksoud Plaza temporarily to his grandson Henry Maksoud Neto who had been working with him since the age of 15. After his death of lung cancer, on April 17, 2014, Neto assumed the presidency officially. He was a Civil and Electrical engineer and received the title of Master of Science in Fluid Mechanics, from the University of Iowa. He was the owner of the hotel Maksoud Plaza, the Vis√£o magazine and the engineering firm Hidroservice. From 1967 to 1968, he was Chairman of the Engineering Institute of S√£o Paulo. The economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek, awarded Nobel Prize in Economics in 1974, became a close friend of Henry Maksoud. The friendship resulted in Hayek's visit to Brazil a number of times in order to promote liberalism. Maksoud advocated to economic liberalism, criticising the dictatorial regime in Brazil. He supported individual freedom, representative democracy and the rule of law. From 1988 until the early '90s, he led a program on TV Bandeirantes called \\"Henry Maksoud e Voc√™\\", where he presented issues and discussed it with well-known interlocutors. Towards a Brazilian democratization context, in 1988, Henry Maksoud proposed a Liberal Constitution, based on Hayek's theories, which was divided into 10 titles, 218 articles, and 294 paragraphs, and it considered that the country should adopt a form of government in which the law prevailed and not the men or the parties, called Demarchy. In addition to his business career, he was an Author and Director of theatrical plays, including \\"Everlasting Emotions ‚Äì A Musical Chronicle\\" presented at the Maksoud Plaza Theatre.

He began working with stencils in the early 1980s, painting on walls, cars and the found paper and objects that accumulated in his studio. He has painted many murals in San Francisco and was dubbed by artist/writer Aaron Noble The Stencil Godfather of the Mission, where stencil graffiti is common. Williams has painted numerous murals in San Francisco, both indoors and out, including Armadillo's on Fillmore Street, Amoeba Records, Clarion Alley, Leather Tongue video, The Chamelleon bar, DNA Lounge, Burger Joint, Pedal Revolution, and The Lab. The preponderance of his work in the Mission and his ability to go back and forth from street to studio has led some people to see him as a forerunner of the Mission school, which coalesced 10 years after he began working in the neighborhood. Working outside the mainstream, Williams exhibited at alternative spaces throughout the 80s and 90s including Show and Tell Gallery, Altarpiece at the Offensive, Bibliomancy, the Adobe Bookstore and Southern Exposure (art space)Southern Exposure . As curatorial awareness of Williams grew, he was invited to exhibit at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, and the San Francisco Art Institute. Williams was born in Los Angeles, California, and grew up in Santa Barbara. He began painting with watercolor in high school, and studied art and anthropology at Santa Barbara City College, Cabrillo College, and Sonoma State University. He moved to San Francisco in 1979 and began to work in color xerox. He lived at the Goodman Building, the last of San Francisco's artist hotels, and was present for its closing and evictions in 1983. The long battle between the Goodman Building's tenants and the City, which owned it, ultimately led to passage of 1988 Live/Work legislation, which made it easier for artists to live in commercial zones. In 1983, Williams moved to Los Angeles and collaborated with Didier Cremieux on a large painting called \\"History of the World\\" which was featured in Immigre magazine. In 1984, he moved to Santa Barbara, continued painting and helped to run Talk Gallery. By 1985 he was back in San Francisco, where he developed a handmade comic series with the characters Robot Dog, Cyber Kitty, and Mean Mouse. During the early 1990s, Wiliams collaborated with the artist Rigo on a series of large murals for the DNA Lounge, including one called the Philip K. Dick Tribute mural. In 1991, Williams was the subject of a documentary called \\"Spraypaint\\" by Nick Gorski. In 2005, Williams received the Adeline Kent award and was given a retrospective exhibit at the Walter and McBean Galleries of the San Francisco Art Institute. In the late 1990s, health problems forced Williams to abandon spray paint for airbrush and he began to focus on smaller paintings and books. Williams' collaborative hand-painted books include \\"Gemstone Fever\\" (2003), \\"Horses West\\" (2005) \\"Amerika Cup\\" (2006) with Fred Rinne \\"Collect Call from the Spirit World\\" (2006) and \\"Watch Your Step\\" (2007) with Fred Rinne and Dana Smith. In 2012, the interior of Williams' Mission District home was reproduced at Steven Wolf Fine Arts.

Mason served as the second president of Chemical Bank from 1831 through 1839 and would later be referred to as \\"the father of the Chemical Bank\\". Mason was a founder of the New York and Harlem Railroad, one of the first railroads in the United States in 1831 and served as the company's second president.

JHU Press, 2003 Biography =Early career= Mason was descended from a 17th-century colonial family. He began his career as an apprentice tailor and then worked as a merchant in the dry goods business.As I remember: recollections of American society during the nineteenth century. John Mason's name first appears in the New York Directory in the year 1796, when the firm of Mason & Sharp is mentioned as a \\"dry goods store, 80 William Street, cor. Maiden Lane\\". The following year John Mason's name appears alone as \\"merchant, 208 Broadway.\\" In 1798 he moved to 84 William Street, remaining there until 1800, when he returned to 80 William Street. In 1804, Mason founded the firm of Mason & Smedes with Abraham K. Smedes, but in 1809 the latter's name ceases to appear, and in 1810 the firm is John Mason & Co. Mason's firm remained at 178 Pearl Street for many years. By the second decade of the 19th century, Mason had established himself among the elite merchants of New York City. During the War of 1812, Mason was among a group of New York merchants that came together to help raise bonds for the U.S. government. Mason personally purchased $5,000 of bonds. =Chemical Bank= Mason became a shareholder of Chemical Bank in 1826 and would serve as its second president. Mason, who would later be referred to as \\"the father of the Chemical Bank\\", and was one of the richest merchants of his day in New York, succeeded Baltus Melick in 1831.History of the Chemical Bank 1823-1913. Privately Published by The Chemical National Bank, 1913 Mason was responsible for establishing the highly conservative business culture of the young bank that would persist for nearly 90 years. For its first twenty-five years, the bank paid no dividends, nor did it pay interest on customer deposits.Chemical National Bank of New York to Pay Interest on Deposits. Bankers Magazine, Volume 94, 1917 Mason was also responsible for leading Chemical through the Panic of 1837. When a speculative bubble collapsed on May 10, 1837, banks suspended payment of gold and silver. Although twenty years later, Chemical would stand alone and continue to make payments in specie, in this crisis the bank followed others in suspending payments. Chemical was one of the earliest to resume payments in specie. Mason died on September 26, 1839, but his legacy of conservatism was taken on by his successors. Isaac Jones and later his cousin John Quentin Jones would lead Chemical, both serving as president, across the next forty years through 1878. Both Isaac and John Jones had close connections to John Mason, particularly Isaac who married one of John Mason's three daughters. John Q. Jones was succeeded in 1878 by George G. Williams, who had joined the bank in 1842 and served as cashier of the bank from 1855 onward. In that position, Williams was also inculcated in Chemical's conservative style of banking. Williams would serve as president from 1878 through 1903. =Family= Mason had a son and three daughters, Mary, Rebecca and Sarah. Mary Mason was married to Isaac Jones, who would later succeed Mason as president of Chemical Bank. Mason's daughter, Mary Mason Jones, who was the great-aunt of Edith Wharton, was the inspiration for the character of Mrs. Manson Mingott from The Age of Innocence. Mason left the bulk of his wealth to his daughters and largely cut his son out of his will after marrying an actress.
